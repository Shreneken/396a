            "content": "While this movie didn't necessarily have to be made, I'm somewhat glad that they did for the entertainment value (just like Halloween 2). I was mostly satisfied as a horror movie fan and some of the directing and storytelling techniques worked quite well (while some others didn't which I will get to later). I liked Jaime Lee Curtis in her role and Michael Myers was scary/menacing/terrifying as always and it was good that they never showed his face. The fact that they included the original music with variations of it and put it in appropriate scenes/used it well was noteworthy. I very much liked that they killed off the investigating/research characters early in the movie and didn't leave them around since they would've probably ended up being a nuisance and annoying like those kinds of characters are in other horror movies. It was clever how they referenced the other old movies about half of the time and had Laurie switch places with Michael in a few ways, however the other half of the callbacks made me roll my eyes. Plus the horny teenagers bothered me again, that was probably the worst thing about the original even though it was good, but it's frustrating that they didn't learn that lesson and kept that trope in. I guess another bad thing about this movie is that it inspired even more sequels after this which it shouldn't have and doesn't make sense since Michael should've gotten incinerated into ash at the end. I would've liked it if it ended after this one similar to how the original second one should have ended it back in the 80s. Hollywood and the studios will never ever put practical and logical thinking before the money that making more sequels can give them though, smh.",

This is a fun slasher and a must-watch for any horror fan. Plus, it is way scarier than the original. If you're a horror fan, this is a must-see",

            "content": "Michael Myers is back and this times he's senile?\nIt was a good movie but not as good as some critics claim. And definitely not a masterpiece. There was some plot holes and a lot of loose threads in the story and characters that seems important but then just disappeared. Anybody who hoped it would have reinvented the genre will most likely be disappointed because it really is the same predictable thing we have seen over and over again since the 70's. You soon realize how the whole movie will go.\nWhile the movie has a lot of trivia from the first movie it sometimes doesn't even feel like the people who made it had seen the original. Because for a movie that was all about getting Halloween back to its roots and be like the original it really got a lot of things wrong, something I think has to do with the fact that this movie was based on their head canon of what was happening in the original.\nFirst of all, Michael Myers seems to have forgotten how to be Michael Myers. He no longer stalks his victims before striking, he just goes from house to house killing people like it's a chore, going through the motion. It almost becomes silly and never scary or that interesting to see him just walk around killing people. Luckily they skip most of those killings.\nMichael Myers suddenly has super strength. Sure, he was always stronger than a normal person but not like this. I'm talking Jason strong. I saw a question on Quora on how he became super strong and now I get why someone asked that question.\nAnd Laurie Strode apparently has also become super strong because she's stronger than Michael during their battle. And she's not that clever when searching for him, opening doors with her gun so he could have grabbed it.\nMichael Myers and Laurie Strode are no longer related and there's no point to it. There is nothing in the movie that makes it impossible for them to be siblings. In fact you wouldn't even have known it if a character hadn't said that someone just made that up to find a reason (that someone was John Carpenter and Debra hill btw). A lot of people are upset by this and that they skipped Halloween 2 (again, for no reason).\nYou might remember that the people who made this movie said they took away the sibling thing because they felt it made it less scary if Michael Myers had a goal of hunting down Laurie Strode and her family, and some speculated that maybe Laurie would be hunting him instead.\nThe thing is, in this movie he's STILL hunting for Laurie Strode and her family, and it is still his goal to kill her. In fact the movie goes so far as to say it's his final goal. That they are two opposites that is connected and drawn to each other that can't die until the other one is dead (yes, they even hinted that Laurie Strode too had some kind of power to survive death). This despite them saying they wanted to take away the supernatural feeling of the series and Make Michael Myers just a killer that could be killed.",

The fact that is shares the same name with the movie that kicked off the series is one of many issues I have with it, but it's by no means the most egregious. The film might be slickly made and well-acted, but like so many other follow ups it struggles to justify its own reason for existing. It's set 40 years after Laurie Strode's misadventure in babysitting, with Strode having gone the Sarah Connor route of becoming a battle-hardened survivalist. Unfortunately, much like Sally Hardesty in the woeful 2022 Texas Chainsaw Massacre film, they've done her dirty. Strode, much like everyone in this movie, is a thundering idiot. I can't stand films where plot points depens on characters being so monumentally stupid. It's the laziest writers crutch I can thing of, right up there with characters not asking basic questions or giving simple explanations. There's a psychiatrist character, presumably a tribute to Dr. Loomis, who exists solely to give Michael a chance to escape and, naturally, be really bloody stupid about it. Myers, despite being a giant lumbering creature of advancing age, is able to sneak around unnoticed wherever he goes, and his imperviousness to bullets and knifes wounds is pushed to the extreme. I was already aware that sequels existed, so Myers surviving wasn't a surprise, but it's so frustrating to see characters we're supposed to like and root for make so many dumb decisions. Strode turning into a Bond villain final in the final few scenes is especially annoying. She doesn't take simple measures to ensure Michael is dead, and then walks away assuming that her plan of burning down her house will do the trick. Predictably, it doesn't, and as a result, this retcon sequel is now a trilogy. Wonderful.",

We see Jamie Lee Curtis has been having her issues (self medicating with drinking ect) dealing with the events from the first film and Michael Myers has been locked up in a mental institution. \n\nIf you would guess that Myers breaks out and starts another rampage on his old stomping grounds, you'd be correct.

With a surprisingly slow first half that sets up Michael's return, the second half is where it hits the fan and everything comes together. The cinematography is also very impressive, including a nearly 3 minute one sot and a death scene involving motion sensor lights. The big problem I have with the film are the new characters that sometimes bring the story to a halt and don't serve much of a purpose other than to be killed.  If you enjoy Halloween (1978), I would definitely recommend giving this a try!",

This very much feels like a popcorn movie; you grab a snack and turn off your brain for an hour and a half. There's no over arching theme, or really anything to think about, the movie actually has little real substance. However, that's how it should be. Also, the plot gets really crazy in the second half.

I feel like I'm watching a really dated film that is trying to be ironic but comes across sarcastic and tiresome. The scares are lacking, the characters unconvincing, the development dull and so on. I could not be more disappointed. Halloween: H20 (1998) was better, at least it got the Halloween vibe and was entertaining. The only decent recent remake was It (2017), that was phenomenal and I didn't get my phone out once watching that. The music and filming are the only positives of the new Halloween.

The camera angles and the style of this film is perfect. They brought back the classic look of Michael Myers and the original cinematography that looks extremely close too the original Halloween movie, and John Carpenter is probably very proud. He is able too bash Rob Zombie and tell him, look this is how do a Halloween movie, the way you did it, was totally bad, in Halloween II (2009). The performances are amazing and the special effects are great. This is Halloween movie and Halloween Kills are both the best Halloween movies since both Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981) combined into one big movie, Which was amazing as well. I hope David Gordon Green does more horror movies and picks an amazing filmmaker too continue the Halloween franchise after Halloween Ends premieres. The movie script came together well, and it went from page too screen very well. All of the props were great as well. The knife that Michael Myers (Jude Courtney/Nick Castle) uses, looks amazing and very realistic when a real knife is not used. The camera operators did a fantastic job knowing how too do close ups, and at what angles they should be shooting from. David Gordon Green did a great job on both directing and writing the movie. The producers did a great job of budgeting the film as well. Everything came perfectly together, as all movies should come together. Flawless in every way.",

What's great about this one is how they went back to basics and delivered raw scares and dread. They didn't hold back on blood and gore either. Jamie Lee Curtis reprising her role as the main protagonist is also one of the highlights of the movie. It reminded me of other badass female leads like Sarah Connor from Terminator. I like the psychological tones in the movie. I also like how they made the first half brutal, and the second half very suspenseful.

The Shape Returns, Shape Hunts Allyson, Shape Burns, updated Halloween Main Theme, Halloween Triumphant, The Shape Kills, Skills Again, The Bogeyman, The Grind, Trap the Shape to name a few. \n\nThe best kills in the franchise, some off screen showing the awesome aftermath and brutality on screen with Arron and Dana. Even little details where Dave got the tattoo of the date which became the day he died is unsettling and Oscars death impaled on the fence.  \n\nSomeone of the best film making I've seen with how certain scenes are shot, lit, directed amazingly, cinematography and sound is incredible.  \n\nThe best Myers mask of all time, unbelievably scary and awesome and a unbelievable performance by James Jude Courtney. \n\nAlso amazing was Laurie Strode how badass she is and Allyson the new final girl. Also other likeable characters such as Julian, Vicky, Dave, Hawkins. \n\nThe prison opening creates tension with the sound design and the visual look. \n\nIt's intense and has one of the best atmospheres of a Halloween and any other films. The opening with Arron with the mask still gives me goosebumps for days. \n\nEvery playful nod to the other Halloween films like Laurie and Myers switching places is great. Season of the Witch masks and Laurie watching Allyson from outside and the boom box kid in Halloween 2 \"1982\" and so many more. \n\nCertain scenes, the tracking shot \"best scene\" was brilliantly done, because Myers killed the kid ealier in the film when Myers stops and looks at the crying baby my heart stops each time as your unsure what he is going to do. He didn't kill the baby as it wasn't a threat, you can also look at it that Myers  killed the mother of the child which means the baby won't be fed and it will have a longer painful death.  \n\nSlashers still have many psychological elements. Amazing story telling keeping the audience on there feet. Also The Shape and Allyson meeting for the first time with that insane peice of music. \n\nThe tape with the Loomis speech saying \"it's need to die and nothing can be benefited from evil\" is goosebumps and  brilliant voice acting impression of loomis. \n\nThe ending with the fire looks awesome and gives you chills. Laurie searching for Myers in the dark house and Myers putting on the mask on for the first time in 40 years which is so important as the shape, the boogieman is back. Also the scene where laurie and Myers see each other for the first time in 40 years. \n\nThe film explores into trauma which the first iconic John Carpenter film has caused difficulties throughout 3 generations worth of lives of Laurie, Karen and Allyson. \n\nWasn't the biggest fan of the Dr Sartain twist and or the character of Ray and some dialogue in the script isn't needed. Karen strode was frustrating but brings it back with the gotta ya moment and Laurie coming out the closet was so intense. \n\nThe opening credits kicks ass with the reforming pumpkin and the end credits where you can her Myers breathing even after the film has finished your still in the moment showing why this film is special. \n\nI am so excited for Halloween Kills and to see what happens next. I really hope it captures the greatest of Halloween and Halloween 2018 and it's own features. David Gordon Green is a under appreciated hero and John, Cody Carpenter and Daniel Davies work on the score was phenomenal. \n\nThis is why I will defend this movie to my grave stone and why it's so great and important to me and brings tears to my eyes in emotional and intense scenes. I've been fair and mentioned some problems but I love this film and always will. There still so much I didn't write about.",

How does this film get such high ratings with the bar for suspension of disbelief being so high. Lori spends decades living in the same house waiting for M. Myers to be released so she can use her boobytrapped house where she raised her children to kill M. Myers. M. Myers would have never found her if she moved to another state. Could you imagine if she moved to Indonesia? \"Halloween Quest the international trip of Michael Myers\". Leave M. Myers as a movie monster making him just a guy takes the terror down to 1 for me. We have movies where tiny 110 pound 5'6 women are taking down multiple hardened 270 pound muscular men. Send Charlies angels after M.

            "content": "It's clear that David Green has tremendous love for Rick Rosenthal's Halloween II (1981). Sometimes it seems Halloween (2018) pays more homage to that film than Carpenter's 1978 original. The only difference now in Halloween (2018) is Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and The Shape (Nick Castle) are no longer siblings, which apparently was always Carpenter's true intention before Halloween II revealed otherwise. Even still Green doesn't offer anything new to the Halloween mythos because everything has already been done numerous times prior. Green even takes a cue from Steve Miner's Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later and retcons the bad sequels. Likewise, Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie Strode and [again] the premise is largely the same as that in H20. The one exception is that Green shows that The Shape can be contained. We learn The Shape was captured at the end of Carpenter's film and has been incarcerated for the last forty years. This alteration to the original's end is actually a bit more grounded with reality. As opposed to H20, which had The Shape lingering about for twenty years as an urban legend. Green does incorporate the gritty tone established in Rob Zombie's Halloween adaptions but merges this into Carpenter's canon. John Carpenter returning to score and produce definitely brings the franchise back to its roots. This shift of focus is now back to The Shape leaving Laurie Strode's perspective secondary. I'm not sure if it was even necessary for Green to span this film into a trilogy. He could've just wrapped everything up in this film leaving its ending as an homage to Halloween II's. While albeit cliche, spawning The Shape back into the flames of hell is generally a symbolic way of conquering evil. Still, post-1978, The Shape is as brutal as ever but barely as scary.",

            "content": "Halloween is a wonky film, yet creates for a good time with some solid scares. Director David Gordon Green is rooted in the film's vision, yet he does not produce the best suspense in the horror flick. Only two out of the several killing scenes truly have an anxiety-filling tone that can bring the scare level to its most distinguished point. Green also makes it too apparent where Michael is hiding before killing a victim. What was so excellent about the original film was that it had those moments that you never knew what was coming. These kills feel predictable and somewhat redundant at times. However, there are some chilling moments in the film. There is a scene in the movie where a character places the iconic mask on themselves. Green got the sequence correct by making it felt like a terrifying, contemporary twist on the Halloween franchise. The writing also feels like a mixed bag at some points in Halloween. The first act is surprisingly weak and does not set up this film in a perfect way. The podcast angle of the film did not work and took away from the heart of the horror flick. There should be suspense and thrill in the opening, not two podcasters lurking throughout the life of Michael. There were plenty of different ways Michael could have got out of the psychiatric hospital and how he obtained the mask. This storyline was not the way to go with it. However, the second and the third acts are solid, with chilling thrills and stellar character arcs. Most of Laurie's actions feel justified, and her relationship with her daughter, Karen, is a core aspect of the film. It is a relief that the film ends strong because the first 30 minutes of Halloween are rough. As for the technical components in Halloween, they are all solid. The editing is the most limited out of them all and brings down the film just imperceptibly. There are a few scenes where the editing is a little choppy and do not flow well into the next scene. However, those long takes were cut at the perfect time, as they are never too drawn out but never extremely short. The cinematography in this film is exquisite. As discussed a few phrases ago, the long shots were well done and created an influential curiosity about what might happen next. The score is exceptional as it uses John Carpenter's themes very nicely, but the composers slightly expand on it to make it distinctive to this movie. The cast of Halloween is strong, yet there were some slight bumps in the ensemble. Jamie Lee Curtis is phenomenal in the role of Laurie Strode. Curtis matures the character to feel very powerful and influential in this installment of the franchise, leaving a substantial impact on the film. Judy Greer is great as Karen and plays the estranged daughter role very well. Andi Matichak is a shining star as Allyson. Matichak felt like a modern Laurie Strode yet still made Allyson unique to her. Matichak had some great scenes and had fabulous chemistry with everyone in the cast. Will Patton is the weakest out of everyone as his line delivery is awful. Patton makes Deputy Frank Hawkins look like he can not do his job and delivers all his lines like a catchphrase. It is hard to watch Patton perform in this film. Lastly, there is Haluk Bilginer, who takes control of every scene where he is present. The turbulent temperament Bilginer gives Dr. Ranbir Sartain is just chilling to watch. Halloween is a solid movie yet is brought down by a few weak story elements and half-baked directing. While the script and direction are not to the most crucial degrees, the cast and technical components of the film are almost perfect. Halloween was close to becoming a supreme horror reboot, yet it does not fulfill the proper criteria to achieve that status. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com",

That can be quite on the nose but the story is compelling bringing back Myers after several decades in confinement, he escapes and wreaks havoc on Haddonfield again. By bringing back Jamie Lee Curtis Laurie main character from the original, the movie gives it an emotional core and gives the movie purpose as Curtis character becomes a PTSD tortured old lady who's badass with guns and survival skills bent on killing Myers. Green directs this movie beautifully with beautiful cinematography and great jump scares and very terrifying moments. The script is riddled with some bad dialogue and some cheesy elements but is coupled with Myers being meaner and more violent than the original.

The acting performances are great throughout and without the forgettable and kind of stupid doctor that seemed to replace the unreplacable in Loomis, this film has more memorable characters than most in the franchise do.

Green brings back Michael Myers as a Terminator like force. Myers is ruthless and seems even more stronger than the other instalments. The scene in the washroom alone shows the film's ruthless path its going down for the future of the franchise. Its interesting where Green is directing the series towards to, almost making the conflict between the main characters almost like a war. With the future sequels, it looks like we mights see some backstory involved, but what I liked most about this film is that there's no flashbacks or anything.

This title disposes of generations of superfluousness and silliness, conferring upon itself true sequel-hood to the 1978 original. It largely earns that self-anointment, with a reliably strong performance from Jamie Lee Curtis as a terminally broken and paranoid Laurie Strode that anchors a movie filled with worthy supporting performances and modern, economic film making from director David Gordon Green. Myers is terrifying once more as he pursues a cast of reasonably three-dimensional characters. Brief breathes of humor help this flick from sinking too far into the mucky territory of it's predecessors, but credit must also go to a screen play that feels plausible and worthy of the original. I worry that the two forthcoming sequels will plunge this series back into putrid, creatively devoid mediocrity, but you have to appreciate these good sequels when you get them.",

The film messes up even the basics of what Michael Myers is, and that is not a psychopath, but something evil, something unstoppable, with no emotion and reason that only he understands. He doesn't try to scare people before he kills them for no reason. He's not Jeepers Creepers. And he doesn't go out of his way to kill people that have nothing to do with his target or the path to her just because they had sex. He's also not Jason Voorhees. He only kills those who get in his way, try to stop him or happen to be in the wrong place when he comes through looking for his sister. No one really knew why he wanted to kill her or why he started killing in the first place. He wasn't a psychopath. He wasn't even Michael any more. He was something purely evil, with only one purpose, wipe out his family line. This is not a proper continuation of that story, no matter how much you ignore. Starting from where you expect us to start, it doesn't fit. There was nothing special about the mask either. He grabbed it off a random store rack. He didn't have any kind of connection with it. Yeah, he's not Leatherface either. He's Michael Myers. Really, do it right or don't do it at all.\n\nJohn Carpenter had the right idea in the first place. Michael's story should have been left alone after the first. The Halloween series was always meant to be an anthology, with a different story each year. But of course studio executives always have their own ideas and that usually messes things up. So Halloween III came and everybody hates it because you already made Halloween 2 another Michael thing. And so it's always gotta be Michael from now on? I'd rather have the anthology personally, but if it's gotta be Michael it could at least be done better. Really guys, all you gotta do is watch the movies and remember things and write the script with those events and rules in mind. It's called research. And don't add stuff just because you think it's cool if it doesn't fit the archetype of the character. I'm sorry but half the deaths that occur in this film occur in a way that the original Michael Myers would have done. You've added you own ideas for shock sake taking those ideas from other characters from other films and not even giving credit to those films by saying it was homage. \n\nSorry, not impressed.

James Jude Courtney's take on Michael Myers is like Nick Castle and Tyler Mane put together which is a great mix and the 2018 mask is my favorite of the franchise. This movie does also have some great kills and great shots of the offscreen kills. Other than Michael Myers and great acting by Laurie strode and a little bit of the characters, this movie suffers a lot of issues. For example, their are characters in this movie that are just their just to adjust the plot like for example they boyfriend. He is dating Allyson and he seems like he's gonna be a main part of the film but he only existed to get Allyson out of the party without a phone and to me that's lazy writing. Plus this movie does feel like they're trying a little too hard with callbacks to previous movies in the franchise. Also the character of Sartain definitely wasn't handle well I mean I always got a weird vibe from him but the way they killed off the sheriff to me it's feels like the sheriff was wasted in this movie and he was great. It's still a decent movie but it's not \"THE BEST SEQUEL\" in my opinion.",

If you like the typical slasher movie it might do the trick for you, but the only thing it did for me is to make me very angry. Even the final kill is not satisfying at all, Laurie's daughter had the chance to shoot him in the head when he fell down the stairs, but instead she chose to hurry over him, up the stairs, leaving him IN A ROOM FULL OF WEAPONS, GIVING HIM THE CHANCE TO GRAB HER ANKLES. wow. Really? Everyone keeps saying this is a movie about strong women, but it really is that full of women taking stupid decisions, that I would classify it as a remake of scary movie. I know in this moment joss whedon is in hot water, but he really is the only person to have created a female character in the horror genre that is strong and fierce.\nEDIT: so, 24 h passed since I watched the movie and I am still livid about the stupid script. I guess I have to make a list of all the things I didn't like to get it off my mind *SPOILERS AHEAD*\n1) the journalists. They're dick heads. I don't like them. So you think visiting Laurie at home and trying to pressure her into talking to Michael is ok? Instant Karma ensues, only satisfying moment of the movie when the dickhead journalist dies. \n2) the sock slide of the babysitter. So, in every other Hollywood produced movie Noone ever takes off their shoes. Americans seem to jump out of bed with their shoes on and only take them off just before going to bed. Yet there she is, the pretty blonde, sliding with her socks on the hardwood floor and so signing her death sentence. \n3)the shrink. So the psychiatrist is crazy and wants to kill too. Wow, what a plot twist.... \n4) Laurie's son in law going outside to check on that police car. So you know there's a crazy killer around looking to get inside the house. And you choose to go outside, leaving the door open? Darwin Award nominee.\n5)also Laurie, why did you bring your family back to your house in the first place. You know he wants you. Why not go back alone and let them drive out of town? \n6)you have that fancy basement panic room hidden under the kitchen island, but you leave the remote on the counter, go down AND CLOSE THE DOOR WITH THE SWITCH DOWNSTAIRS LEAVING THE REMOTE UPSTAIRS. Y tho? \n7)so you hide in your fancy panic room, you have to do nothing but stay quiet, he will never know you're there, but you think it's a good idea to fire your gun through the kitchen floor, hoping to shoot through the Michael's foot. You obviously miss and Michael unnecessarily learns about your position. Great job. \n8)you come out to search for Michael in the house, giving away your advantage. The panic room has one entrance, if he wants you he has to come through that door, don't you think that it would be safer to wait there and point the gun at the entrance? \n9)so Laurie's daughter manages to shoot Michels ear off, and he somehow falls into the panic room. He is laying on his back, vulnerable, and you drop your weapon and climb over him, instead of shooting him in the head and ending it there. Yyyyyy thoooo???

            "content": "\"The night he came home\" Even after 40 years on, John Carpenter's horror classic remains an endearing part of Horror cinema. Not only paving for the way the genre was to change in years to come but just how marketable and financially successful a film with a minimal budget and fewer resources could be. The film, in the early stages, was going to be called The Babysitter Murders but the title Halloween is what stuck.\n\nThe story goes that a young boy named Michael Myers commits the ultimate evil by murdering his older sister with a big kitchen knife. As a result, he is put into the care of Doctor Loomis played by Donald Pleasence. Michael Myers subsequently escapes the confines of the asylum and flees to his hometown of Haddonfield on Halloween night. While in Haddonfield, local babysitter Laurie Strode played by then-unknown Jamie Lee Curtis, has to fight to survive Michael's killing spree before the night ends.\n\nEarning early-on negative reception by the critics, the film overtime became revised as a brilliant piece of film-making and influence on directors and audiences to this day. As a result of the film's box office success - several sequels were spawned - to capitalise on the \u2018slasher' craze that emerged during the 1980s. Most of these did not earn the respect of the critics or vast majority of fans of the original.\n\nHalloween 2018 is the third attempt to bring out the series from the doldrums and to also bring back Laurie Strode into the core of the story once again. Starting with Halloween H2O in 1998, followed by Rob Zombie's 2007 remake of John Carpenter's original. Neither of which ended up being warmly embraced by audiences and critics. The story here re-writes everything the sequels created and carries on precisely 40 years since the original film's timeline. Laurie Strode once again played by Jamie Lee Curtis, has become a paranoid mess since the events of the first film. Having been estranged from her daughter played by Judy Greer for whom she has fought to protect and train for what may come; along with her granddaughter.\n\nMichael Myers has since been captured and held prisoner at Smith's Grove Sanitarium where two journalists arrive and confront him with his trademark mask. After a prison transfer involving Michael goes wrong, it enables him to escape once more and go back to the town that made him a legend. After being left in doubt her for many years, Laurie soon gets word on his escape and is ready to arm herself. She will have to prep her family - for what she has been preparing them for - throughout their whole lives: the return of Michael Myers.\n\nThis particular sequel to the original is undoubtedly an affectionate one. Director David Gordon Green (Undertow, Stronger) and writer Danny McBride have expertly carved an entry that attempts to evoke the original film's style and pace. The opening credit sequences and theme alone are made the same. The film contains nods to the original that are shown in certain scenes which evoke a feeling of homage but in the right way. Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic in reprising her role, exuding a broken down but equally strong persona. Left scarred after her last encounter with Michael, she is clearly having a ball portraying Laurie Strode as essentially a \u2018Sarah Conner' figure in contrast.\n\nJudy Greer is also excellent, though not always given enough to do. As her screen time is often sidelined for Laurie's granddaughter and her high-school friends. All of whom are ready to party and have a good time as the genre often features in these stories. David Gordon Green also knows how to light and direct Michael Myers as the haunting boogeyman in the most appropriate way. With scenes where Michael appears in shadow, or where Michael appears in jump scares involving a cupboard, evoking a sense of dread and foreboding. Nick Castle reprises his role as Michael Myers and clearly has lost none of that movement and menace that made the character famous formerly.\n\nThere are elements where the film falters. Such as, much of the film places bigger emphasise on teenage characters as a way that seems very marketable but takes away more important plot strands. Most importantly, the relationship between Laurie Strode and her daughter, which could have been explored more in-depth. Some of the pastiche elements of the film work for me. However, others may feel that it's merely retreading ground; reminding of them of something better that came before this. There is also one plot device near the third act involving a central character. That when it was revealed, felt very mind-boggling and almost took me out of the film entirely.\n\nOverall Halloween 2018 is undoubtedly a cut above the past sequels, which probably wasn't that hard seeing as one entry involved Michael Myers facing off against Busta Rhymes (really!). The acting here is excellent, particularly from Jamie Lee Curtis. The atmosphere evokes dread and suspense, there is a good use of gore presented here and works as a decent follow up to John Carpenter's bogeyman-fearing masterpiece.",

            "content": "Halloween is one of the cleverly written franchise horror movie to date. Aside from giving us moviegoers the nostalgia of original Halloween of 1978, it sets a retroactive continuity of the franchise as it directly continues as the sequel of the first Halloween film in which the events take place exactly 40 years since the first. I say the writers was so clever in writing this sequel because the story of Halloween this time has more depth, more substance and more characterization. Plus, the whole plot made sense and purpose of what the first film has already established. I also love that this Halloween film goes back again to the elements that made first film a notable horror slasher film. It incorporated a lot of themes and elements up the iconic musical score of the first film that made it a classic horror film.\nAnd what a better to do this sequel than to made the iconic Halloween star and scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis to return again as Laurie Strode, 40 years later! But this time Curtis played Laurie as a mature woman with tougher, smarter and braver qualities that she learned from the events 40 years ago. Curtis is still impressive and loved how she played Laurie this time with more substance and personality. With this sequel, we sorely miss Donald Pleasence as Dr. Sam Loomis which I think this film would be awesome if he returns as I think his character would be pivotal in this current sequel.  Good thing, his absence was compensated by great supporting cast like Judy Greer, Will Patton and newcomer Andi Matichak. Halloween is not just a fan service movie but its return to its roots and origins made it the same effective horror slasher film that it is known for! But this time with fresh suspense, thrill and mystery to its bag, Halloween ranks as the best sequel to date of the franchise.",

You can tell unlike a bunch of other horror movies around the time, they were actually trying to be scary. It has quite a few moments, one scene that really stands out was when Mike Myers was in the neighborhood and got his knife and killed some people, and the fact that it was all in one take, that scene was actually really good. The cinematography was pretty good, the pacing was decent, and the soundtrack was pretty great. But the biggest problem I have, the problem I have with all these damn horror remakes, is that you are never going to make a movie as good as the first Halloween. For a soft reboot of the series, I\u2019m kinda disappointed. There\u2019s a lot of I\u2019ve been there, I\u2019ve seen that before, and I know who Mike Myers is, and the fact that he isn\u2019t scary anymore. Everything feels uninspired, and it falls flat on its face at quite a few times, and with the moments it does have, it also has a lot of dumb sh*t. Full of annoying characters, weak scares, and a weak script. I could tell the actors we\u2019re trying, in particular, I thought Jamie Lee Curtis was trying way to hard at times, but I don\u2019t think they saved the movie. Even though it took itself more serious that the other sequels, there is not a bone in this films body that is remotely scary. And you compare this to the original Halloween, and every aspect is on point, and John Carpenter\u2019s style bring the movie up so much, by building that sense of eeriness and claustrophobia, and the fact that you feel Mike Myers is always watching, works so well for the movie. And those aspects were kinda absent and lacking from this movie, cause I just wasn\u2019t scared. I mean it was ok, I can tell everyone cared, it\u2019s certainly better than the other sequels in the series, but it\u2019s just a shame it\u2019s not as good as I thought it would be. Not scary, didn\u2019t work that well, tried too hard at points, but overall I enjoyed parts of it.",

The visual approach in using similar shots and concepts as its predasessor is where this film is at its finest, yet it falls short in the elements that were attempted to be incorporated with questionable plot management and difficult characters to become invested in excluding Michael or Lori. The best thing you can take from this film is the return of the iconic score and the best Meyers portrayal since the halloween 1978, a worthy direct follow up to greatest horror/slasher film to have been made.",

H20 was a perfectly acceptable send off to horror legend Michael Myers until money-grubbing and cash-grabbing drag him back from the grave and into two decades of unimaginative, and even ridiculous, sequels. This title disposes of generations of superfluousness and silliness, conferring upon itself true sequel-hood to the 1978 original. It largely earns that self-anointment, with a reliably strong performance from Jamie Lee Curtis as a terminally broken and paranoid Laurie Strode that anchors a movie filled with worthy supporting performances and modern, economic film making from director David Gordon Green. Myers is terrifying once more as he pursues a cast of reasonably three-dimensional characters. Brief breathes of humor help this flick from sinking too far into the mucky territory of it's predecessors, but credit must also go to a screen play that feels plausible and worthy of the original. I worry that the two forthcoming sequels will plunge this series back into putrid, creatively devoid mediocrity, but you have to appreciate these good sequels when you get them.",

Perhaps the best part of this film is Curtis' performance playing a very different Laurie Strode than we saw in the original 1978 Halloween. The filmmakers choose to disregard every Halloween sequel which plays to their benefit because, as an audience, we get to see a fresh take on John Carpenter's slasher classic. Halloween is a nice balance of fresh and new; there are plenty of call backs to the original to give fans a heavy dose of nostalgia but they also find new and creative ways to build tension. One gripe I have with this film is that, at times, it falls under the weight of familiar tropes and cliches and unfortunately the occasional cheap jump-scare. However, the negatives are significantly outweighed by the positives and I can say with complete confidence that Halloween 2018 is a welcome return to the slasher genre and perhaps the best Halloween sequel we have ever had.",

I have only seen the original and haven't heard particularly good things about most of the sequels, so I decided just to go ahead and watch this new one. I personally think the original movie is one of the best horror movies I have seen and think it builds suspense masterfully. While I do feel this movie has a different feel to it being newer and clearly bigger budget, it doesn't have the same impact that one does. That's not to say the movie isn't fun, because it definitely is. When it comes to any tense scene in the movie I thought the directing was handled very well. I also liked how it explored how the events of the classic movie can really mess up a person and Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job portraying someone who grew up to be rightfully paranoid. However, this movie has some oddly placed humor that feels more obnoxious than just as comedic relief. Nonetheless, this is a fairly entertaining movie that has a handful of great moments that had me on the edge of my seat.",

            "content": "It's clear from the opening credits that director David Gordon Green desires not only to pay tribute to the John Carpenter original (which also serves as the ONLY accepted background for this sequel.) but also wants to reanimate and bring back some kind of luster to this series which had been literally rotting away in an unholy mess of reboots, remakes and misguided sequels. No more are we expected to believe that Laurie Strode (A formidable Jaime Lee Curtis returning once more to her iconic role) is Michael Myers' sister like it was established way back in HALLOWEEN II, or worse yet, that Myers is some part of some cultist plan to bring back Samhain. \n\nThis time, Laurie strode, in pure Sarah Connors fashion, has prepared all her life for Michael Myers' return. Her house off the grid is booby-trapped to the hilt, and she spent years training her daughter (Judy Greer) to be ready for such a confrontation, until she was taken by the State at the age of 12. She, however, has not embraced her mother's paranoia, and has tried her best to keep her own daughter (Andi Matichak) away from this insanity. Of course, Laurie's fears were justified as Myers manages to escape during a transfer to another facility. (The scene where Curtis witnesses the bus carrying Myers leaving the mental institution is especially poignant. Her acting being assisted by everyone on the crew that night wearing a \"We are Laurie Strode\" name tag). Of course, we have to accept that Myers was eventually captured after his disappearance at the end of the 1978 film.\n\nAlthough director David Gordon Green is not known as a horror director (having being at the helm of stoner comedies like YOUR HIGHNESS and PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, and dabbling in a pretty decent inspirational drama with STRONGER), and claims to be respecting the original film, he does stray from Carpenter's bloodless approach in the 1978 movie by offering a healthy dose of onscreen violence and gore. Something to attract the kids and the Blumhouse fans, no doubt. \nNevertheless, it's refreshing to see Michael Myers back as a simple, mindless embodiment of evil. Not a vengeful sibling. Not a troubled child from a white trash upbringing. Just a relentless killing \"shape\". (with director Nick Castle once again donning the discolored Captain Kirk mask.) And it's also a plus to see John Carpenter himself back at the music, adapting his unforgettable 1978 score with his son Cody Carpenter, and his godson Daniel Davies, both of whom are part of his band on tour, and have contributed to his albums LOST THEMES I and II. I'd be lying if I said that hearing his music over the trailers didn't create in me a strong desire to go see the film just for that very reason. Carpenter's involvement also extends to being executive producer and creative consultant. \n\nThe script by Danny McBride and Green is streamlined enough, yet one can question the motivations of journalist Aaron Korey (Jefferson Hall), whose obsession with Myers presses him to do something stupidly reckless, under the watchful eyes of Myers' psychiatrist Dr. Sartain (a rather cartoonish Haluk Bilginer). The good doctor is also the focus of the only truly groan-inducing scene of the film, which sets up a concept similar to one unconvincingly explored in the previous films. One can only hope it will be abandoned in the now announced sequel.\n\nThe one thing the script gets right is the interactions between the three women stalked by Myers. There is no denying that there is a certain amount of satisfaction in seeing three generations of women fight back against an assailant who resurfaces after 40 years. The timing couldn't be more appropriate, considering some of the political headlines that have been pretty influential on the upcoming midterm elections. In Green's HALLOWEEN, the Strode women are done being victims, and will turn from prey to predator. The victims who fight back against the monster is nothing new; Nany confronted Freddy at the end of NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (1984, Wes Craven), Ripley kicked the Alien mother's ass in ALIENS (1986, James Cameron), and so on. Yet at this moment in time, Laurie Strode standing up to her attacker feels more pertinent than ever. \n\nWho would have thought that 40 years after his initial carnage, Michael Myers would find some kind of relevancy in the #metoo era.",

So because the other movies don't count and the fact that they aren't related anymore I find it hard to be real invested in the characters and what is going on. Because Michael killed these people 40 years ago and tried to kill Laurie 40 years ago it's hard for me to believe that she would do the things she did in this movie because she only had 1 encounter with this person 40 years ago. Why would she assume he would come back? Why would she be paranoid about seeing him again. They don't have the history and the numerous encounters to where I could go with how she behaves. They don't have the history that this movie wants these characters to have so I have a hard time going with this ongoing battle and this \"rivalry.\" And the psychiatrist who has been working with Michael is weird. And what he does doesn't really make sense to me. Now having said all that I enjoy Jaime Lee's performance and the killings in this movie are brutal. So it is a so so movie.

This time could of been spent exploring Laurie's time after Michael and how this effected her relationship with her daughter. Yet, apparently the creative team behind the movie felt like a 30 second montage was enough to cover this crucial plot point. \n\nNow, the above could of been forgiven to degree if the movie was at least a decent slasher movie, but apparently it couldn't even manage that. The entire movie lacks any sense of tension and Michael's rampage of killings is a bore. Even the iconic music failed to recreate the unsettling atmosphere of the original. \n\nThe general premise of the movie was fantastic and I honestly believe this movie could of been something really special, but somehow they managed to squander all of it's potential.",

Michael has extraordinary strength which makes no sense considering he's been kept under lockdown and I doubt he's been exercising much - he doesn't even run anywhere he just walks everywhere. A lot of the plot is predictable - Michael going after the documentary people to get his mask, the doctor losing his mind, etc. The idea that Laurie has been training her whole life and booby traps her home because she expects Michael to escape is just dumb. There are some weird actions that are completely illogical such as Laurie turning off the lights in her house when she expects Michael to come - surely you want to be able to see the intruder rather than wandering around in the dark? Keeping the remote control to the basement on the side right next to the basement entrance is stupid. Apparently, this film also ignores the sequels (which I haven't watched because they have awful ratings) but maybe that's a good thing. The cinematography and soundtrack were great, and so were some of the action sequences but this film isn't what I'd consider 'horror' it's more of just a crime thriller about a weirdo in a mask.

Everything that made the originals so good, this film disregarded.\n\nThis is the first movie I debated on walking out on after paying for. I even tried to force myself to sleep through it at one point. It's that bad.\n\nI liked the brutality of the death scenes and the homages to the original films. But that is where the things I like about this movie end.\n\nDon't believe me? Watch the intro scenes before the title screen. It's anticlimactic. After that, the movie is a borefest of boring dialogue until Michael gets his mask. Expect about 30 minutes of endless talking before that happens.\n\nThe film also writes out all the sequels past 1978. This by itself should be a crime. The writing-out makes Michael Myers seem to be another random serial killer. The obsession that people in the movie have towards him now makes no sense. There are worse serial killers than Michael Myers since 1978. This single writing out of past movies destroyed my suspension of belief. The Halloween universe now makes no sense.\n\nWith the writing-out comes Laurie Strode's representation. This is a conflicting one for me. Though I appreciate the use of the original actor, her character makes no sense now. No explanation is made to how Laurie could afford her home and lifestyle. With someone who suffers from severe PTSD and paranoia, I doubt she could hold a job for long. Let alone affording all the things she has in the movie. Also, how would she know that Michael Myers is coming back? I understand the emotion involved, but she couldn't have been so prepared. The fact that she stayed so armed to the teeth removes a lot of tension.\n\nOne thing that made the originals so scary was how defenseless each protagonist is against Michael Myers. Having someone who is trying to hunt him down removes a lot of suspense.\n\nMichael Myer's portrayal was one I didn't appreciate as much either. He seemed to be able to take damage more than he did in the other movies. The fact that he didn't seem as invincible as he was in the originals removed his aura of mystery and terror.\n\nThen there are the \"teenagers.\" The selection of the \"teenage\" actors is terrible. These actors are already wrinkling and look like they're about to hit thirty. Their dialogue was cringe-worthy and reeks of pandering. Slang words are fake or outdated. Attempts at jokes were not funny. The party and dancing scenes is cringey at best. This movie could cut 90% of the high school scenes and nothing of value will be lost.\n\nWhile we're on the actors, let's talk about the deaths. While most were brutal and satisfying. Some deaths didn't make sense. There are places where people could have outrun Michael Myers. In such instances, the movie hides their deaths and shows dead bodies after. I know how Michael Myers walks, and it's not fast at all. Lazy writing if you ask me.\n\nSpeaking of lazy writing, let's mention jumpscares. I hold special hate towards is unnecessary jump scares where no one is in danger. Those, to me, signal cheap thrills that are the same as a sucker punch. If I get a jumpscare, something crucial has to have happened. This movie has those unconsequential jumpscares, often.\n\nIf you want real terror in horror movies, look at the ones who do suspense building well. The sense of not knowing what will happen next lead us to want resolution, even if it means scaring us. Imagine Alfred Hitchcock's \"bomb under the table\" example. This movie lacks the original tension building that the 1978 original did so well.\n\nOne tool that helps build suspense is music. That's an area this film lacked in. Shame, since the original was so good at using a musical score to build suspense and add tension. The music score that made the originals so terrifying is not there in this movie. Plenty of scenes were lacking. \"Scary\" scenes are now no longer scary.\n\nI doubt I can go much further without spoiling the movie. But you get the picture.\n\n1/5. The film does too much pandering to fanboys instead of focusing on making a good movie. Cinemasins is going to have a field day with this one.",

I won't say greatest horror movie \"franchises\" of all time however, because admittedly the 'Halloween' movies have had many missteps within their film-canon, which I suppose are now no longer canon. That is probably for the best, with the 1978 'Halloween' being a classic then it deserves worthy additions to the franchise, if it even needs any (which it doesn't), although the 2018 'Halloween' did nothing but sully its legacy in my opinion. Where do I even start. The acting is nothing special, in fact there are some pretty terrible cases of it. Jamie Lee Curtis is really the only good part of this movie. A wonderful actress trying her best with the script given to her. While I mention the script, it's awful... Cringe-worthy and out-of-place comedy scattered throughout, compromising any possible suspense or seriousness that the movie tries to build; which it could barely muster up in the first place. The tone is all over the place, bouncing back-and-forth between non-scary horror to un-funny comedy. Also some of the choices made in the film are ridiculous, and any new characters introduced into this Halloween universe, which is nearly all of them in this movie; are either boring, plot-devices to propel the already lazy plot forward, or poor \"comic-relief\". I really don't like being this negative about movies, because movies are truly a passion of mine, and to be fair if this was a standalone horror movie and not trying to be a sequel to one of horror's classics then I probably wouldn't be as hard on it. Although due to it failing so miserably in my opinion at sufficing as a worthy sequel, I'm going to say this is really bad. I used to think this was a 3/0, but the more I think about it the sadder I am to see how much potential it squandered. The only thing keeping this from being unwatchable is Jamie Lee Curtis' performance and maybe two really cool cinematography shots. If you're a fan of this movie, there's nothing wrong with that. I just wish I was.\n2/10",

Curtis is excellent as the battle-hardened Strode, the kind of terrifying grandma we all deserve. Judy Greer is also brilliant (when is she not?) as Laurie's distant daughter. It's when the film attempts to make me care about teenagers that it falls down, because I just don't. When you've a compelling story about a strained mother/daughter dynamic and 40 years of trauma, the only thing the teens can be is fodder that makes me feel nothing when they get moidered. Also, by removing the preceding films, the connection between Laurie and Michael is diluted. Why would he be obsessed with her for all these years if they'd only had a single encounter? Yes, he's crazy, but in building up their final confrontation, the film benefits from the years of clashes between the two characters without actually accepting that they exist. That said, it's a scary film, truly showing the single-mindedness of Michael Myers, and turns him into an unstoppable force of nature.

It's as though the movie wanted us to recognize the history the two had with his repeated returns to kill her in the retconned sequels, but didn't want to acknowledge their timelines. The heavy emphasis on guns wasn't intriguing. I actually liked the dialogue, particularly the brief moments with the little black kid.

It took its original score which was never truly expanded upon in the other films, and created something even better. It didn't feel predictable and turning it into a thriller was a good move.

It kept true to the original concept of The Shape while still being able to reinvent the character, or lack there of. The idea of him being a mindless killing embodiment of evil is much more scary than being obsessed with killing his last remaining family members, which every single sequel and reboot film relied heavily on.

Basically, I would consider it no better than any of the sequels it attempted to blow out of the water. \nReview: While being a long time fan of the franchise and an expert on the Halloween movie series I certainly enjoyed watching this film, as I have mostly every single one in the series (despite how bad some are), this movie is among the worst ever in the entire saga of Halloween pictures. \nCertainly better than either of Rob Zombie's films, but of roughly the same quality of Halloween 5 and 6, Halloween fails to do what it set out to do, which was become a solid sequel of the original one. \nWhile I certainly commend the filmmakers for attempting to create a sequel that would be superior to all the ones ever made and to drift away from the genuine pieces of garbage that were Rob Zombie's films, the reality is that their attempt falls tragically short. \nDespite some good scenes here and there, particularly the one of the murder of the drunk kid in the grounds of a mansion, as well as that in the Hospital when Michael is presented his mask, as well as the personal vendetta the sheriff has against Michael,   as well as creating a heroine that, for the first time in all Halloween films, is a genuine foe to Michael Myers and provides an actual strong and worthy adversary, and a masterful acting job by Jamie Lee Curtis (particularly portraying someone who suffers from PTSD) the movie has a lot more negative aspects than it does positive.\nIn terms of characters, there is no development whatsoever. Aside from Laurie Strode, whom we know from other movies, all the characters are simply flat. The pathetic attempt for a new Dr. Loomis fails miserably and angers the viewer, as his rudimentary attempts at a revolutionary psychiatric treatment are straight out of fantasyland. The three generations of Michael Myers hunters (except for Laurie) is also completely lifeless and dull, and the sherriff, who seems to be the only characters genuinely motivated to stop Myers out of sheer virtue and righteousness, is not given enough time to become the hero he deserves to be due to a stupid plot twist that leaves the viewer shaking his head in total negligence for the screenwriter and director, who did everything to shoot themselves in the foot. \nStructurally, the film is poorly paced. Aside from the fact the whole shenanigan regarding the investigative journalists takes up a good chunk of screen time via a set up that is simply too long to create and could have been used in a much better way, the suspense is simply underwhelming. Of course, there are points where you do feel on the edge of your seat, but those points fail to climax, and all one can feel is frustration. Repeatedly, through the movie, you see scenes in which you naturally expect something bombastic to happen, but it never really does, therefore, you feel empty and wondering when the hell something worthwhile will happen. \nFurthermore, the movie is so poorly paced that it feels as though there is no second act. There is only a long first act and a short third act in which the victim and victimizer confront each other for yet another clich\u00e9 Halloween ending. Of course, it's nice for the Killer to be set up in a trap, but there are so many plot holes in that final showdown, such as questions like \nWhy didn't Laurie Strode truly fortify her cage?\" and \"Why doesn't she just shoot him with a hand grenade?\" that it too, is ultimately unsatisfying. \nIn addition, some of the supporting characters are so pathetic that you're almost glad when Michael wipes them away. The movie fails to do anything it anticipated, desired, or planned, and while there are some worthy scenes, the reality is that it fails, and that it does so miserably. To be honest, the movie trailer promised a film that was not delivered.",

Those films present the ONLY real reasons for the Lori Strode character to fear his return: 1) the sibling connection and 2) his return 20 years after the original proving that he is hellbent on killing Lori. But Halloween 2018 throws away those timelines, meaning that she's merely a random survivor of one single killing spree in 1978 and he's been under lock & key the 40 years since, so there is ZERO logical reason Lori would ever think he would return specifically for her; unless the Lori Strode character is so weak-willed that she allowed the trauma to destroy her mind, which I don't want to believe of our first Halloween heroine. Furthermore, the deaths are absurdly anti-climactic. There are two scenes where Michael strolls into someone's house and sticks his knife through people's necks or other body parts in under 10 seconds with zero build-up. The scene where Michael kills the young boy's babysitter at least attempts to build up some suspense, but the moment he begins stabbing her, all the horror is undercut by the little boy donning the \"sassy black boy\" archetype and shouting \"Oh, shit!\" which is clearly meant to be a comedic line. Why would they attempt to insert COMEDY in the middle of Michael's murder? Wouldn't one expect that to be an obvious faux pas for any horror movie, let alone a sequel to one of the greatest of all time? Furthermore, why are we supposed to care about Lori's new family, when this is now the 4th Halloween continuity timeline that replenishes new characters like recyclable cardboard boxes? Does their life or death even matter? They've already thrown away the entire existence of many characters we were supposed to root for in previous films like Jamie Lloyd and John Strode. So now all new characters feel like placeholders. The opening scene is one of the most laughable, nonsensical sequences I've ever laid eyes on. What is shouting at a mental patient with his 40 year-old murder mask meant to accomplish? What does getting him to talk even matter to anyone? However, I give the film major props for the twist of Michael Myers' doctor aiding Michael's murder spree by killing the police officer -- that was a very surprising, convincing, and thrilling twist that added extra horror to a film that badly needed it.

The characterizations of several characters are inconsistent, switching back and forth between badass and panicky. The lead teenage character who we think the torch is going to be passed to just doesn't cut it.

Carpenter also makes a grand return to the series and his music contributions are the difference. Most of his compositions are beautifully realized and utilized in the areas of the film they need to be.

Here are some of the things I noticed with the movie. \n\nThe D-bag boyfriend never shows up again, he was pointless (at least kill him off haha) \n\nThe doctor and the journalist keep talking about how Myers never speaks, bulilds it up, aaand he never does. I'm happy he dosen't speak but don't build it up and then have nothing to show for it, then there was no need to have it in the movie in the first place. \n\nWtf is up with the coboyhat wearing Sheriff Barker? He says roughly \"So you mean Michael Myers and 30 mental patients are running loose on halloween? But what are we going to do, cancel halloween haha\" What real life sheriff would not take this seriously? \n\nLauries daughter rejects Laurie when she tells her that Myers is free, but in the end seems like she always was aware of the danger and even shows that she is prepared by playing her self of as defensless and then shoots him with a \"got ya\". I'm aware that she was trained as a kid and is trying to forget this. But if she knew deep down, why did she not go with Laurie , why did she reject her mother while knowing the danger Myers posed, endangering other lives wich got her husband killed in the process. \n\nThe halloween music was IMO over used and the reveal music (like when his reflection showed up in the window) was pointless becaus we friggin saw him walking up to the window!

This movie basically ignores all the other stupid sequels to just create another stupid sequel that doesn't even prove to the viewers that this Halloween sequel is something different. This had so much potential to actually be a well made Halloween sequel that we never really got. David Gordon Green could have done a much more improved job with directing than he did. The writing by Danny McBride was...well lets just say that you can tell that McBride wrote the script with David Gordon Green, and when I say that I don't mean it in a good way. Really there was no reason that John Carpenter couldn't have wrote and/or directed this because if George Miller can direct another Mad Max sequel, and it still be good than there is no reason why John Carpenter cannot do the same with the horror genre. The only pros that I have with this film are Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strodes, and the character Michael Myers played by Nick Castle Jr. Everything else in here was just atrocious. ",

I've loved horror ever since my sister and uncle taunted me with the idea that the lake he lived near was none other than Camp Crystal lake. For years, I was terrified! One day I finally broke the seal and actually watched one and the love story started from that moment.\n\nHalloween was often a lesser franchise for me. I was a huge fan of FT13 and ANOE Jason and Freddy were supernatural on a level that Michael wasn't. I mean looking back, he definitely had elements but not to their level. It took me until my late teens to really appreciate what Halloween was all about. I watched them all (I believe up to H20 at the time) and like everyone else, 3 threw me for a loop but the rest created another icon for me.\n\n18 years later, Michael comes back to Haddonfield for me (albeit 40 years since the original). Halloween (2018) did something that's becoming more and more popular it retconned previous entries out of existence. I actually prefer this to the rebooting of the entire series.\n\nI definitely enjoyed this, Blumhouse is pretty much flawless so far. I was excited to see a deeper dive into the mythology. Oddly enough, at the same time this kind of felt like a rehash to me. I really hope they add something new to the sequel that's already in the works.",

First, if a bunch of mega psychopathic killers escaped, and the police knew, not only would they warn people to stay inside and lock their doors, they would patrol the streets with busses together with a full army of police to fetch people up, to move them to a secure location (nope they let kids run around playing no problem xD). Moreover they would hunt these killers down, again with an army of police. It would be on the news everywhere Nationally so that even people in other states would know about it.The mother that wanted to kill the murderer might have choosen to stay behind (if she could escape the police that would otherwise force her to come with them). And if she would be able to she would not be stupid enough to stand next the the doors with little windows that you can clearly open by breaking lol. She would stand 1 meter from the foor and shoot the sucker in the face, you know with the tactical shotgun she had with her!?! haha. In the end *spolier* all three of them have shotguns and yet even when the maskguy is beaten down they still manage not to shot him in the face or even the \"centermass\" in a way that is deadly. Nono they have to burn the hole house down to take him out hahaha seriously??? anyways, I guess to some extent this was okay like in the 80 early 90s, but 2018 when it was released? yea not really. PS: Also the students are beyond stereotypical xD and that dude that she is suppose to be with and his jelly friend.. he is clearly a gigant douch, and his friend is cleraly suppose to be the less attractive since he is overwieght? xD the blond girls dude is more realistic for sure however so it's not all bad haha.",

Myer's original obsession Laurie Strode is now living the life of a well armed hermit, awaiting the day when Michael returns for her.   Michael escapes, heads get bashed in and people are stabbed which basically sums up the rest of the film. \nNow I was really looking forward to this and I have mixed feelings about them ignoring the previous inferior sequels. In one way it was a wise decision to continue the original story and have it based a little more in reality.  It made the character of Michael seem a little more real rather than this supernatural unstoppable force.  However, I don't believe Laurie Strode would be living in what is really a secure bunker with enough weaponry to take out the local police force just based on the events of the first movie.  These are the actions of a character who has faced a supernatural unstoppable force many times before so I think they messed it up a little in that regards.  It was entertaining enough but it's still the original that remains as the one to rewatch.",

It feels very similar to the original film, although whereas the original had a creepy and tense vibe throughout the entirety of the film, this sequel is able to hit the same level of tension but unable to carry it during the entire film. The film has many clever connections to the original, so I suggest you go rewatch/watch it before seeing this one. A few issues aside (most of which can be overlooked), Halloween \u00e2~18 is a superb film that lives up to the original. I cannot wait to see this film again.\n\nThe opening sequence was very cool and got me pumped up for the rest of the movie, but after the opening titles the film moves pretty slowly, it wasn't until Michael went to obtain his mask, and the awesome gas station scene ensues that the film really kicks off. Every moment Michael was on screen is amazingly well done. The tension, the creepiness, the score, it all comes together to make every moment of Michael perfect. The way that Michael moves throughout the landscape is just so creepy and builds a tone of suspense, I was so nervous and anxious every time he was on screen. This was the most anxiety-inducing film I have ever seen in a theatre and it\u00e2(TM)s great!\n\nLaurie Strode\u00e2(TM)s psychological damage is portrayed very accurately. Jamie is terrific. The kids are also fantastic, notably Andi Matichak as Laurie\u00e2(TM)s granddaughter and Drew Scheid as the \u00e2~boyfriends best friend\u00e2(TM).\n\nHalloween \u00e2~18 is a must see for all horror fans. It got almost everything right that made the first film so great and iconic. Make sure you see this one in theatres if you can.",

But the problem with ignoring everything is that Michael Myers goes from a force with 100s of kills to 5.  We as the audience understand Michael Myers as a force of nature, but the characters in the movie shouldn't, but they still treat him that way.  Laurie's trauma I understand and actually kind of like.  At first I felt the same way about it that I did about everyone else's reaction to Michael, but really she was at ground zero to Michael's rampage, and just looking to real life people have gotten messed up from far less so it's actually believable she'd become this reclusive person prepping for his return.  The film is at it's best when it's Laurie's story.  I'd kind of compare it to the Aliens films.  In the first one, it was people totally unprepared.  In the second one, we got to see what happens when soldiers face off against the Aliens.  Here, Laurie has completely Home Alone'd her house to prepare for Michael, so the final confrontation is satisfying because she knows what to do and she's prepared for it.  However, the other characters are still required to do lots of stupid stuff.  There's some dumb comedy and weird character bits, and I actually didn't mind it for the most part because it gave a level of realism to their world.

Not just things like \"oh, they don't know they're in a slasher movie,\" dumb, things no person should do in any situation regardless of a killer being on the loose dumb.  There's also some annoying subplots that go absolute nowhere, like a cheating boyfriend.  Most slasher movies would take the chance to kill him, but here he just...I don't even know, he never even shows up again after being a dick.\nLook, the film has problems when I look back at it is what I'm saying.  But while I was watching it, I can't deny it was a satisfying Halloween film.  Far and away the best of the sequels, and definitely a better return than H20.  There's a great approach to Michael as a creepy force in the distance that I really liked.  There's one scene in particular where I thought to myself \"wait, did I just see him walking by in the background there?\" and I really wasn't sure I had until the characters started finding bodies.  Stuff like that is great and gives it a creepy atmosphere.  It's got good atmosphere, but for me it was never outright scary.

Halloween 2018 has so many flaws, so many unlikable characters including Laurie Strode this time she's unlikable nothing like she was in Parts 1, 2, H20, & Resurrection, also this movie has so many uneeded scenes, some senseless twists it, and some immaturish lines like the part where the dad says \"Peanut butter on my penis\" which is definitely a line Rob Zombie would also use in his Halloween movies, so yes because of all these things mostly the immaturish things Karen Strode's husband says is what makes this movie seem and feel like a repeat to the Rob Zombie Halloween films, mostly a repeat of the 1st 2007 one \n\n\n(except without the Brother & Sister angle) because atleast in that 2007 remake Michael Myers looked like himself. So many things that go wrong in this movie, even Michael Myers is not himself in this movie because he is extremly passive, he's just randomly killing people and characters we are never introduced to or even know anything about, while Laurie Strode is the one pursuing him instead and when she finds and Michael Myers sees her Michael Myers just walks away like a pussy after Laurie Strode shoots him in the upper shoulder. So yes overall this movie is simply terrible, no improvement from the Rob Zombie horrible garbage films.",

There is not much to say about this: a killer escapes and tries to kill people, specifically a woman that he could not kill before he got locked up. The story was pretty good, so simple that you could not mess it up. But, there are some plot holes and unanswered questions that actually bugged me. The movie itself was not scary but it did have its creepy moments. Honestly, I wished the gore was better, being a slasher film, but it still had violence. The acting was actually pretty good, from both the adults and kids. This is an alright movie, entertaining for sure.",

The mask of the movie was genius they didn't really changed anything about the mask they just added more details to it and it's the best mask so fare then all other sequels!

            "content": "Strengths: There has been a lot of bad with the Halloween franchise since the 1978 original. To make another good one, it made sense to go back to the roots. This movie captures a lot of what made that one work. The atmosphere is exactly what it needs to be. Dark, creepy, and helped by an updated take on John Carpenter\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s iconic score. I really liked the camerawork at points. There\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s a single shot sequence that was some of the best work in the history of the franchise. The kills are brutal, especially one during the aforementioned sequence. It was cool getting Nick Castle (Michael Myers) to reprise the role he made iconic in 1978. Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode) gives what might be the best performance in the history of the character. Yes, even ahead of part one. Judy Greer (Karen Nelson) is solid, while Andi Matichak (Allyson Nelson) feels like she could be a breakout star.\n\nWeaknesses: Haluk Bilginer (Dr. Ranbir Saratin) plays a character that is not only irritating, but ultimately pointless. He is intrigued by Myers\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM) mindset, which is fine. But when he murders a cop and dons the mask himself, it beyond jumps the shark. While I enjoyed the kills we got, I do feel the film needed more. It felt like they were trying to ensure they captured the atmosphere and forgot to deliver on some of the kills, which is a major aspect of slasher films. There\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s one kill that looks awesome, but happens off screen. I also wanted a bit more creativity with them. While I don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t love most of the sequels, ignoring the continuity often is jarring. Also, the post-credits stuff kind of takes away from the ending and is implausible\n\nOverall: Halloween captures the spirit of what people love about this genre. There are plenty of issues that keep it from being great, but it is a welcome return to form for the series.",

It also makes many references to the very first film, which is interesting, and the performances are good too, especially with a return from scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis.

            "content": "Movie was terrible - this review will contain spoilers. \nCinematography was fine - music, acting, and slasher style were pretty ordinary but undoubtedly competent. What ruined this movie falls into two main categories - 1. Placing more emphasis on SJW feminism than substance, and 2. Ridiculous plot devices devoid of subtlety. \n1. On the first point, as is the case with the vast majority of Hollywood movies nowadays, the identity of the characters and their development in the story adhere strictly to a feminist / SJW narrative of overcoming the oppressive white patriarchy. I first noticed this in the movie when a man and his son happened upon the crashed bus Michael Meyers had escaped from. The brief conversation between the man and his son before encountering the bus went vaguely as follows - \"Dad, do we really have to go hunting today? I want to go to dance practice.\" \"Son, you really want to do dancing? Why don't you want to do somethin manly like huntin' and fishing'?\" - Okay, so clearly they're using a common trope in horror films- demonstrate a character flaw before that character gets killed, so the viewer sort of sees it as justified. This old man was an \"instrument of oppressive gender norms\" so it was clear as day at that point that he was going to be killed and that the movie producers were conveying his \"backward\" gender conception is his character flaw death sentence. I then began noticing this social justice bent a little more and saw it everywhere - the boyfriend was a dumb cheater who destroyed her phone when she found out, the lovable male friend crossed the line and tried to kiss her, the dad was largely insensitive and callous, all of the male cops were incompetent... All of the male characters were either idiots, ethically questionable, downright evil or some combination of the three, while on the other hand, the females in this movie never demonstrated flaws or weakness. Laurie was sort of \"flawed\" in her obsession with Michael Meyers, but the viewer doesn't really believe it to be a flaw, since we know Meyers will be on the loose and sure enough he escapes and the other characters learn, as we've known all along, \"she's not so crazy after all.\" And all other females are perfect in pretty much every way, with the movie culminating with the three women (who didn't mourn the murdered father AT ALL) being badass, brave warriors who confront and defeat the evil with their superior intellect and tenacity. Sooooo typical of modern feminism contaminating plots. There's nothing wrong in society with women reaching their potentials, and I don't think women ought to be held back, but it's nauseating and insulting to have that message forced down our throats with every major Hollywood movie. We get it! Not only is it insulting, but it's reducing the effectiveness of your movie. Horror movies are good because their protagonists are vulnerable, not because they're fearless heroes. \n\n2. Here are some of my problems with the caveman-like plot devices used to get from point A to point B in this movie. First, Laurie has been so traumatized by what happened 40 years ago that she still thinks about it all day every day. I'm sorry, but that's completely unrealistic. People recover from trauma. Even if they maintain deep emotional scars, they will eventually recover. Many people have undergone trauma that is far, far worse than what Laurie went through, and they go on to lead normal lives in the vast majority of cases. Sure, some people might be predisposed to mental disorders, but in this movie, Laurie's strange paranoia is meant to convey just how SCARY Michale Meyers is. She was REALLY traumatized, ok guys! While that little plot device is meant to make me fear Michael Meyers, it really just makes me not believe what they're saying about Laurie's character. \n\nSome of the murders were genuinely unexpected though, and for that the film deserves some credit. I couldn't believe they killed off the two journalists so early, and I know some other reviewers have called that lazy. Maybe it is but it worked for me, since killing such main characters is unexpected and makes me think the director means business. Similarly, when the babysitter is about to get killed, I expected the little boy to save her, but he didn't. It reminded me that the director meant business, but as this went on, I started to realize that everyone but the most major characters were likely to get stabbed. \n\nHow in the hell Laurie could have known that her little kitchen trap door thing would someday be used to trap Michael? That's so ridiculous! It was stocked with food and guns as if it was a bomb shelter to be used for hiding, and she even puts her precious daughter in there to protect her. And then the twist is like, just kidding, it was an offensive trap. Then why did you stock it with food? Why did you hide your daughter in it? How could you have possibly known events would transpire in such a way as to get Michael in the cellar? It's so unlikely and logistically ridiculous. \n\nI could go on, but I've made the points that I wanted to make, and my fingers are getting tired. Don't waste your money on this movie.",

There are also glaring plot holes. No explanation on how Laurie Strode affords the seemingly huge amount of land that's gated like a prison and a personal security system that includes her very own panic room which comes with a small arsenal of guns and ammunition. They don't show how Michael escapes for the second time. You don't get to see a lot of the kills and some of them serve no purpose and don't connect with the rest of the movie. In the original Michael killed for one reason: to get to Laurie. All of his kills lead up to him finding and trying to kill her. And hello? They leave the douchey boyfriend alive? Come on. And why all the quick shots of the side and back of Michael's head? One of the best and scariest things about him is that you never get to see his face. But now, when he's in his golden years and is all grey and wrinkled and looks like my grampa, that's when we get to see him?! Did you think that would save this movie? Well, it didn't. Even the very haggard looking Jamie Lee Curtis didn't save this. I really wanted to like this movie, but it was just so meh. Other than the last 20 minutes or so, largely forgettable.

The reporters seemed to be added for no reason than to add exposition, the backstory to Michael's character and a way for him to get his mask back. That in and of itself is fine, but then why waste so much time on them. Give us the backstory through the newer characters we are supposed to care about. Tell it through Laurie, her daughter, or her fucking granddaughter. Don't bombard us with all these new characters that you gave yourself no time to introduce and no time for us to care about. Really dosappointing. On a final note, don't harp so much Micheal being able to talk and then not have him say a word. It is unnecessary if you arent going to do anything with it. Rob Zombie's remake was better, minus the sequel, as it at least delved into why he is the way he is. You gave us nothing but sterotypical, unoriginal, copy and paste nonsense.

Fine.  At one point her granddaughter becomes a sitting duck and she has to sacrifice her defensive position to help her out.  That's understandable.\n\nBut this woman built herself a fortress not just to keep the baddie out, but to kill him.  Right?  So then how does it make sense that, after the house goes into lockdown, she has NO offensive capabilities.  There aren't gun turrets.  There aren't cauldrons full of hot tar.  Nothing.  Apparently her plan was to lock herself away until he dies of old age.  Fair enough, I guess.  But then how is she going to get grabbed through a window by standing too close to one of the doors in her fortress?  It's such a weak job of home defense for someone who we are led to believe is so intensely focused on just that.  \n\nOther than that, it was an okay slasher just like the original, I guess.",

I feel like maybe they need to leave it as is for at least another 50years before going there again! \n\nIt would be nice to see new different characters created with different storylines and supported with a decent budget. Most new slasher films are cheap and extremely fake. So would be nice to see Blumhouse productions sort after a new generational villian. At the moment it seems that they are doing the ghost evil spirits thing to death.

I've been a loyal fan of the franchise.  This movie really really impressed me.  I found it much scarier (anxious, nervous and very tense) than I was expecting.  In the beginning it started off a bit slow but when they decided it was time to start the action, things got tense for me in a hurry. And it stayed that way til the end.  The atmosphere they were able to create was great. The acting was great, the score was great, the direction was great and the cinematography was excellent.  They used smaller houses vs big ones in the original and that really helped give a feeling of claustrophobia when they were it tight quarters.  I was also very impressed with Michael.  He wasn't a giant like RZ's... he looked like Michael from the original (thank you Mr Castle)love.  His presence was commanding and scary.  And they put him in the right settings/situations to bring out the most in him.\nAs a fan of the series they didn't let me down and I'm so thankful and appreciative of that.  My faith is restored in the franchise and Im looking forward to the next iteration.\n2nd viewing:\nI waited 1.5 years to watch it again.  I watch a ton of horrors weekly, so given enough time I generally forget the small things and that makes it so much fun to watch my favourites again.  And I probably liked it even more this 2nd time.  It got a serious reaction out of me 3-4 times... and it was still as tense and nerve-racking as the 1st time for the rest of the runtime.  I really don't have much to complain about.  I can't wait for the next iteration to be released so I can watch this again to get me primed for it.  Highly recommended for slasher fans.",

The things that hold this movie back from being great is the very odd placement of MCU style humor that just doesn't work at all and can actually kill the pacing in some scenes. Although the worst part of this film is the bizarre twist that completely drops the ball  even though they end up not even following the plot thread so it ends up being completely pointless. Although these flaws did not detract from my enjoyment in a major way because they are not focused on as much as the the rivalry between Micheal and Laurie which works very well.",

            "content": "A solid entry into the franchise and definatley the second best in the series behind the original released in 1978. The film has some good sequences, and my rating is largely biased due to my obsession with the series, because most of the suspenseful scenes were shown in the trailer, robbing the final product of any true suspense. There are alit of call backs to John carpenters blockbuster which eventually feel like a drag, as it almost feels like the movie can't create any content for itself. It's sad to see a reliance on nostalgia to fuel its scares. The twist at the end with the new loomis ( I've literally forgot his name his character was that forgettable) is an insult to the late great Donald pleasance and the enthusiasm that he brought to the role, and the twist itself makes no sense, considering he goes from a regular doctor to brutal murderer in about 4 seconds. Jamie Lee Curtis I'd the standout character of the film, reprising her role as laurie strode from the original, she gets a lot of character development in this movie which could be expanded on in the sequel. Unfortunately that's where the good characters end. Laurie's family have no purpose in this film other than to advance the plot. There is a farely cool moment at the end with Laurie's daughter, when she,'s crying in the basement before shooting myers in the face. Speaking of the shape, he also gets a bit of character development, I'm of course referencing the scene where he is brandishing a knife next to a crying baby, before leaving without shaking up a child. Most characters in the film literally feel like target practise for myers, and the film repeats the same motif of myers stabbing up a neighborhoid of horny babysitters, which was stole exactly from the original. Speaking of being stolen exactly from the original, the only rememborable kills in the film are the ones which we've already seen in other films in the franchise. It also seems like they might explore another plot with allyson, as the camera zooms in on her holding a knife at the climax of the film, implying they are going to copy the Jamie story line from previous Halloween films. I feel like I've rambled on for too long now and this is my first review and I want people to actually read it. BTW thank you if you did read all this. Th entire film feels like a setup to a sequel, and when you realise that the film is just a cash grab, it loses any quality it ever had.",

In fact, it's rather sad what's done to the Laurie Strode character.  And, the film doesn't really gain much by wiping out all of the previous sequels from continuity: Michael Myers gets a little bit of his mystique back and the brutality of his killings make him someone to be feared once again.

Every single piece of shit one that has followed 1978\u00e2(TM)s masterpiece by director John Carpenter. They\u00e2(TM)re awful, they\u00e2(TM)re campy as hell but they are just guilty pleasures of mine that make zero sense.\n\nSo this movie scraps all those. Period.\n\nBeing a direct sequel to the original, we find our heroine Lori Strode, now a broken woman. Divorced, alcoholic and still haunted by the events of that fateful fright night years before, this movie does an AMAZING job at displaying to us the psychological and physical torture this woman has gone through, and what else has suffered because of it as we get to know her family throughout the movie. A perfect picture display of PTSD, Jamie Lee Curtis is flawless in this film.\n\nAs is my favorite knife wielding psychopath,\nMichael Myers.\nTo say he is the personification of pure evil still doesn\u00e2(TM)t do it justice, and this movie shows that. Relentless in his pursuit and vicious in his ways of going about it, when Michael Myers is on screen doing MICHAEL MYERS TYPE SHIT,\nTHIS MOVIE IS GOLDEN.\nDirector David Gordon Green does an incredible job of bringing back the fear that comes along with the character. Three scenes in particular when you\u00e2(TM)re watching a character on the screen, then you suddenly see \u00e2the body\u00e2? silhouette begin to appear in the background, creating that slow build towards a fast and gruesome death. IT\u00e2(TM)S SO GOOD.\n\nBut unfortunately, the movie does not just consist of those killings for a solid hour and forty five minutes. Its because of some ill written comedy, that literally has NO PLACE being in a movie like this. \n\nIt takes away from the suspense that was built two minutes prior, along with a side plot that literally does not service to the plot, are reasons as to why this won\u00e2(TM)t go down as a classic like the original. NOW DON\u00e2(TM)T GET ME WRONG, this is not a bad movie. Frankly, its actually quite good. But my expectations were high for this, and when fluff begins to outweigh Michael\u00e2(TM)s return and the killings that follow, it left a sour taste in my mouth that couldn\u00e2(TM)t let me give this anything higher than a B. \nThis Halloween, if you get a chance, give Halloween your two hours and see what you think. \nGrade : B",

But finally I got the chance to see Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode in a very iconic way, and The Shape at its finest performance ever!\n\nHalloween isn't perfect though, I have a little flaw with it, and it is killing two people for no reason, maybe the old woman (as we saw in the trailer) because he wanted the knife, but it's very similar to a scene in Halloween II, when he killed an elder woman as well to take her knife, still it was very well directed, as soon as this was about to end, he enters a house to kill a woman for no reason, he just kills her, so this scene is wrong but the music with the amazing direction made this scene entertaining!\n\nBecause of these two flaws, Halloween isn't perfect, but entertaining, and it did some stuff way better than the first one: the performances, the pacing of the movie which this one was more fast-paced and the breathtaking moments.\n\nHalloween is very entertaining, I loved it and I'm gonna give it an A!\n\nAlright guys, thank you as always for reading my review, and supporting my stuff.

That is a long way of saying it's been forty years since writer/director John Carpenter first introduced us to \"The Shape\" otherwise known as Michael Myers, but it is also to point out that while Curtis' twenty-year reunion with her most famous character saw Strode as a woman on the run from her past, changing her name, concealing her identity, and attempting to move on while having raised a child in as much of a captive environment as possible director David Gordon Green's (George Washington, Pineapple Express) new film sees Strode as someone who has lived with the trauma of that single night for forty years and who has been waiting for an opportunity to take back what was stolen from her. It's admittedly both a rarity and an oddity to be able to see two different, but fully fleshed out interpretations of a single character and the aftermath of dealing with such a traumatic event, but it is in considering the different ways in which Strode's life might have unraveled as a result of that Halloween night in 1978 that Green and co-writers Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley find their \"in\" in terms of how they can make their iteration of a Halloween sequel both different enough and justified enough for it to exist in the first place. In reality, we're dealing with a viewer's pick of alternate timelines based on preference and 2018's Halloween throws its hat in the ring by offering up the idea that everything that occurred in each of the seven sequels, including 1981's Halloween II that famously disclosed Laurie Strode was Michael Myers' long-lost baby sister, ever happened. No longer is anything canon except for what went down in the only installment Carpenter himself directed. And so, with that, Michael Myers no longer has a familial connection to Strode and thus no reason to make her his mission. This opens up the possibility for 2018's Halloween to simply be about a cold-blooded serial killer who murders at random because he's a monster following his impulses whereas Curtis' Strode is now the one who has built-up this connection between herself and Myers and sees it as her destiny that the two of them might once again come face to face. That Strode is more attached to Myers than he is her is the \"in\" Green needed to bring a fresh perspective to this endlessly re-made and ret-conned horror franchise, but it is with this twist on the original, principle character that not only do we get fertile new territory to explore, but we get to genuinely and sometimes gruesomely see the process of Laurie Strode truly taking back what was taken from her all those years ago.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

Essentially the new Halloween II, who would have thought it would come from in part Danny McBride and David Gordon Green?\n\nJamie Lee Curtis becomes Laurie Strode by way of Sarah Connor here, having prepared herself for Myers' return from day one. Its been decades and she's filled that with learning how to shoot, how to trap, and how to be a questionable parent. It's inevitable that this movie would get Terminator 2 comparisons, and in regards to theme and storytelling, its pretty well done. It even adds a further level with Strode being a grandmother who has been pushed away from her daughter so she can barely see her granddaughter, even if Laurie is certain she's right. There's something about three generations of women facing adversity and conflict and manipulation from the world of less capable and/or scary men.\n\nAnd while we can mention the several examples, I'm guessing you're more here to find out how Michael Myers is handled. The way that he is is definitely the weakest part of this movie. There was something about the indie film sensibility of the 1978 version and its almost bloodless murders. 2018's Halloween feels like the bigger budget sequel that would be made in the 80s and that's not the best thing. Myers feels more like Jason Voorhees, killing more graphic and violent here, including a knife stab more at home in Friday the 13th 3-D. That's the thing with it being made today after the legacy and the increase of talent and budget. Halloween is made bigger and better, and in some places that works well, and others not so much.\n\nMake no mistake, Halloween is still creepy and tense, but the threat of Michael Myers is now cartoonish. \n\nFor every great moment or callback there is a moment that pulls you out of it. Where the sequel can't ignore the modern update. It's the Force Awakens affect on the filmmaking of the original trilogy. Made by fans but needlessly updated and enhanced, full of cool ideas that forget the truth of the original. \n\nAnd it's that Myers is pure evil, and he doesn't have to crush a face with his foot to prove that.",

            "content": "Halloween 1978 was a seminal moment in Hollywood horror.  A small budget \"movie that could\" gave us a legendary villain and established several tropes within the slasher genre (the final girl and the \"morality check\" potential victims often have to pass).  And it established the legendary careers of Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter.  But the franchise that followed was among the most mismanaged horror series in existence.  Only fleeting moments of Halloween II and the Rob Zombie remake were of quality and even then, not able to save or revive the brand.  But after years of hiatus, Halloween is back with a direct sequel to the original which has scuttled the rest of the franchise.  This is not the first time this has been attempted, but it may be the only time it was successful.  Halloween 2018 takes place exactly 40 years after the original.  Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a gun-toting hermit that is estranged from her daughter and granddaughter.  Meanwhile, Michael Myers escapes during a prison transfer and makes his way back to Haddonfield, Illinois, where a vengeful Laurie awaits...\n\nHalloween 2018 is a fairly straightforward mainstream horror flick.  We have set-up, building tension, Michael Myers killing people, confrontation, and pay-off.  It doesn't reinvent the wheel, and it feels no need to do so.  We do get some deconstruction with Laurie Strode and what the events of the first film have done to her.  It has essentially ruined her life and that of her family.  It looks for a moment like we are about to get a portrait of what violence does to people on a psychological level.  But this is mostly in the first act and discarded once Myers starts murdering teenagers that we don't care about.  And that's what kind of prevents Halloween 2018 from becoming a truly great film, instead of the pretty good one that we got.  This REALLY should have been a micro-focused thriller between two characters, instead of the general slasher retreading that one expects of the genre.  But despite this, it's a far better sequel than any other in the franchise by virtue of it being competent and coherent, which I suppose doesn't say much.  John Carpenter produces the film, while David Gordon Green directs, and his frequent collaborator comedian Danny McBride helped pen the screenplay.  Jamie Lee Curtis is probably the reason to see this film.  Her performance is exceptional and there are several layers of traumatic emotion placed on her face in every scene she's in.  That and she is pretty fucking cool.  The rest of the cast is adequate I suppose.  Michael Myers is the force of nature that he's supposed to be and James Jude Courtney gives him the physicality that he needs to be intimidating without being obnoxious or comical.  \n\nIt's the movie that fans wanted and audiences needed for quick entertainment around the Halloween season.  I did not find it particularly scary, but I found myself enjoying all the gory kills because I'm fucked up.  And while this should be the definitive conclusion to this troubled series, letting it end on a positive note, we all know that this will not be the case.  They will make more sequels as long as they produce capital.  Like Michael Myers, IT JUST WON'T DIE.",

This sequel ignores the lore of the franchise and avoids the storytelling pitfalls that have hurt the franchise after 40 years. I think it is brilliant they skip over poor sequels, not a bad option and something that should be encouraged within Hollywood, no more reboots just belated sequels please. Halloween is a great film and this sequel comes very close to the quality of the first film but the high body count and a twist that sadly was a little too much for my liking. The film doesn't attempt to sustain the terror like the first film, it ramps up the killing and we learn nothing about Michael Myers, he is just evil but come on. Halloween 2 would have been included in the mythology had they not introduced the brother and sister angle, that's my gut feeling. If the filmmakers kept that sequel I would not have a problem if the body count, that made sense, but a direct sequel doesn't explain the body count, my opinion. The franchise is in great hands and I think another sequel will deliver something different and unique, that ending is a ripper. Not the film I expected and sadly it still falls on the clich\u00e9s of modern Hollywood, but at least it is respectful, and that score is amazing. 18/11/2018.",

Rob Zombie revived the franchise in 2007 with a back-story for methodical killing machine Michael Myers that nobody asked for (surprise: his family life was not great). Now an H40 later, director David Gordon Green and actor/writer Danny McBride have revived the franchise by going back to its roots, namely by ignoring all of the seven sequels and bringing back Curtis yet again. The new Halloween 2018 edition is a strange experience for fans. The first half feels like an elusive parody of the franchise, and then the second half drops comedic pretext and becomes much more serious and straightforward. As my pal Ben Bailey said, I can understand people hating this movie or loving it depending upon the half they focus on. This new Halloween ends on a high note but still could have been so much more.\n\nIn the decades since the original murders on Halloween, Laurie Strode (Curtis) is living a hermetic life. She's never fully recovered from the events of her traumatic youth, and so has been preparing intensely for Michael's eventual return. She rigorously trained her own daughter, Karen (Judy Greer), for self-defense to be a survivalist, locking her in the basement and training her with an array of firearms. Laurie thought she was drilling her daughter to be strong and a survivor, but the state had other interpretations, and so Karen was removed from her mother's home and grew up resenting her oppressive, paranoid mom who took away her childhood. Karen has forbidden her own daughter, Allyson (Andi Matichak), from interacting with her crazy grandma, but both find ways. Michael Myers breaks loose from a prison transport and is heading back to Haddonfield with a mission to find and kill Laurie. They're on a collision course H40 years in the making.\n\nLet's focus on that peculiar first half first. There were several points that made me shake my head and wonder if they were trying to be subtlety tongue-in-cheek or bad on purpose, and because of the pedigree behind the project, I had to give it the benefit of the doubt, but to what end? Why skewer horror tropes in a subtle way that could be construed as simply being bad instead? Why even do it for this franchise and then mostly drop it by the second half? There were several moments where I had to laugh and I wasn't fully sure it was intended. This was my dilemma watching Halloween 2018 and I'm sure others will have a similar experience, scratching their heads and wondering why the movie is going the route that it is. Take for instance the horror trope of the bad babysitter. We have another situation where a nubile high school girl is going to invite her boyfriend over for some late-night action, nodding to the 1978 original film. Except the kid being babysat sees through everything and calls out his babysitter. He's a street-smart kid who speaks with the voice of the knowing participant, like when he tells the boyfriend that he will die if he goes upstairs (spoiler alert: this kid is prophetic). There's a string of kills that feel perfunctory, like the filmmakers have noticed that too much time has passed and have to satiate audience bloodlust to buy them another ten or so minutes of setup and characters. The kills themselves are lackluster. Even the gratuitous nudity is fleeting, confined to a quick flashback relating to young Michael Myers spying on his big sister (one of these days a slasher movie is going to be replete with wall-to-wall male nudity and no boobs just to mess with its target audience). There's the trope of the ineffective police officer. After finding out Michael Myers is on the loose, an officer bluntly says, \"What are we gonna do? Cancel Halloween?\" The answer is, yes, you cancel the trick-or-treat activities for the town where this guy is clearly heading and you adequately warn the populace. You ask for assistance from anyone with a cell phone to broadcast the whereabouts of fugitive Michael Myers. The guy is pretty large and easy to spot, plus he's not that traditionally fast. A citywide digital manhunt might have made for a more interesting movie premise with some genuine cultural commentary.\n\nOr take for instance the stupid side characters meant to be fodder for the merciless kill count. The movie mysteriously gives these disposable characters little one-minute asides to present a glimpse of another story that we're just not privy to. There's the little kid who doesn't want to go hunting and wants to be accepted by his father as a dancer. Okay, that's a more interesting conflict than I thought, and then the dad immediately stops at the site of a bus crash with wandering chained inmates and says, \"I'm gonna check this out, stay here.\" It's like Green and McBride gave us one page of characters from an indie drama and then had them smash back into idiotic plot devices making the most headache-inducing decisions. Another instance is a pair of cops debating over adult meals and bread. I appreciate the effort to try and flesh out the characters in a way that makes them feel more real, but then they have no larger bearing than being the next in a line of victims. There are other strange reminders that things just aren't exact with the movie, at least for the first half. It's this curiously overwrought, off sensation that keeps the audience from fully engaging, being told to possibly laugh with or at the movie.\n\nI also think the film is fundamentally flawed in its approach, namely by elevating Laurie's granddaughter as a co-lead. Allyson is too removed from the situation to give an interesting perspective, so she becomes any other teenage heroine we've seen in scores of slasher cinema likely meant to appeal to a teenage ticket-buying audience. The real conflict and the real story is the relationship between Laurie and her estranged adult daughter. There is so much drama there to unpack and the movie would be far better had the filmmakers eliminated the majority of the extraneous characters and focused on these two women and their decades-long acrimony. Get rid of Allyson's boyfriend, who gets way too much screen time to simply be jettisoned without resolution (his lone purpose seems to be disposing of her cell phone). Get rid of his friend, a supposed \"nice guy\" with his own entitlement issues. Get rid of the babysitter friend and her dumb boyfriend. Get rid of the cops. Get rid of the Doctor Loomis prison doctor replacement, nicknamed the \"new Loomis.\" Get rid of them all, including Allyson. I would have preferred Allyson being murdered in the middle of the second act as a means of raising the stakes and forcing Laurie and Karen together again. This is very much a PTSD film about the long ramifications of trauma and how it affects multiple generations. I would have loved seeing that play out in the interplay between Laurie and the daughter that she pushed away in an attempt to save her life. There is so much palpable drama there that I'm genuinely shocked how little Karen figures in Halloween 2018. It's such wasted dramatic potential as well as a better focal point for the movie.\n\nIt's the second half, and in particular the third act, that saved the movie for me. The finale is everything fans would want, transforming into a surging siege thriller built around Laurie's well-armed abode. It's here where the movie becomes a multi-generational fight to the finish and the Strode women must team up to fight the man responsible for the long lingering trauma that has defined their lives in innumerable ways. It's a climax that feels elevated by the pull of history, and it's terrific and terrifically satisfying. Watching Laurie stalk the house in search of Michael Myers, going from room to room and locking them down, is the first actually nervous sequence in the film, benefiting from the investment we have in Laurie as an avenging figure. It's during this sequence where Curtis (Freaky Friday) and Greer (Jurassic World) remind us what wonderful actors they can be. It made me wish for my more realized version of the two of them and their relationship even more. This is where Green (Stronger) also demonstrates his best sense of geography and escalation. Beforehand there are a few nifty tracking shots, paying homage to the opening of the original, but they're self-contained, congratulatory moments. It's the finale that made me realize what this movie should have been from its first frame. Lucky for Halloween 2018 it ends a high note (excluding the cliche post-credit revelation).\n\nThe newest Halloween movie has lit up the recent box-office charts and ensures this won't be the last we see of Michael Myers and potentially old lady Laurie Strode. That's kind of a shame because Green's movie serves up a fitting finale for the series that could work as a capper for Laurie as a character and a survivor of trauma. But alas, the ringing of cash registers will be enough to extend the franchise and carry on more blood-letting adventures for the man in the William Shatner mask. Halloween 2018 starts off fairly rocky with a question concerning overall tone and intent. There's humor that feels grafted on from other parallel reality versions of this story, somehow blurring together into a weird final product. The second half works much better than the first when it stops cracking wise and takes itself seriously enough to realize where the real drama lies, with Laurie facing down her demons and working together with the women of her family for maximum vengeance. Watching three generations of Strode women fighting together is a triumphant conclusion. It's a shame that it won't actually exist as a conclusion for that much longer.\n\nNate's Grade: C+",

Micheal Myers was just a murderous maniac and that is what I would expect from his long hiatus away from Laurie, after all he has been waiting to get to her and Laurie has been waiting to kill him. There was many strange and empty analysis surrounding this movie, especially in the scene where Micheal Myers does not kill an infant. This scene had some reviewers claiming that this action humanized him, which is humorous to say the least. Halloween opens with the first kill being a younger boy possibly no older than thirteen. The legacy of Micheal Myers kill attitude is based off pure murder will, opportunity and provocation. This movie brought the sheer torture of a killer that can be anywhere at anytime and he is not human in any way because he kills back to back, in a schedule of evil. This schedule of evil only doctor loomis could have predicted and this Halloween film pays homage to some of the franchises most classic murder scenes in a modern yet beautifully cinematic way. Small hang ups I had about this movie was the slow family drama involving Laurie, her daughter and niece. These seemed to develop really strangely and some acting from other actors was fear-esque and did not embody why one should fear Micheal Myers escape from a mental hospital. One of my other upsets with the Halloween 2018 film is Micheal Myers insane doctor and the character development of why he was so obsessed with his patient to the point of wanting to be a killer himself, it was out of place and did not get explained throughly. With the unique franchise of Halloween movies that have been made this latest installment was advertised to be a good scare, which it indeed was. This Halloween film has done what many have not been able to do in quite a while, bring brutal killing and anxiety without the over sexual nature that most horror movies can have, usually we need god awful sex scenes or a bimbo who's open breasts are more important than the killer chasing her.This thrill ride of a horror film turned a classic slasher killer who while lacking motive still managed to bring the  excitement and unknown to big screens again.",

However, for a horror movie this movie is pretty great and you kind of get a feel for the characters. Michael Myers was an emotionless, silent killer(which is his character) which was pretty expected so cool I guess. Jamie Lee Curtis\u00e2(TM) character was what really threw me off. Her intentions where to prepare her family for Michael\u00e2(TM)s coming, which any logical person would do, but the way she handled things and how she acted made me annoyed every. single. time she was on screen. The mom, was a pretty strange character. She seemed like your ordinary typical mom and would never expect that she was trained to shoot a gun at a young age. It was like she had a button to turn on that side of her and it was off for the whole movie until the very, very end. The daughter was like she was thrown in the movie because why not. She had a boyfriend who served no purpose the whole movie, except breaking her phone. Michael\u00e2(TM)s doctor turned out to just be a fan of Michael Myers which was definitely an unexpected twist, but only because it was stupid. The whole movie was about Jamie Lee Curtis\u00e2(TM) character wanting to kill Micahel once and for all, and it happens in a dumb reason. Her whole house was meant to just be one huge trap for Michael to just be set on fire and crushed with rubble, yet us viewers obviously know this is definitely not the death ot Michael, so why did Jamie Lee Curtis\u00e2(TM) character not even check to make sure he is dead? Her whole life was spent on killing him and she doesn\u00e2(TM)t even check his body? Halloween was an entertaining movie, beginning was slow, but it catches itself up and delivers a treat to all horror-movie lovers.",

Before I saw this movie I rewatched the original one and it was amazing to see her change from this innocent teenager to a tough woman who would do anything to see the end of Michael Myers. The opening credit sequence to this film was incredible. I wish I could say more about the sequence but it would be borderline spoiler territory so I won't. This movie had some pretty good tension in some scenes as well. Mainly the ending of the film. But no matter what if there was tension or suspense in a scene in this film it was good. As much as this film had some good things about it, it also had some negative things about it. One such thing is the editing in this film. The editing from beginning to end was terrible and all over the place. There were a few scenes where it was okay, but most of those scenes were the suspense scenes. One thing that was great about the first movie was how little you saw Michael Myers which is what him so mysterious but in this one, you saw too much of him. This movie is 1 hour and 44 minutes long and you can feel it. The story isn't interesting unless Laurie is on screen. You don't care about the other characters in this film and just want to see them die. In the end, Halloween (2018) is a good slasher movie but if you want a good slasher and movie then watch the 1978 one.",

This film means that none of the sequels ever actually happened and that Michael was apprehended after the original. It gives us a sense of all the pain, suffering and depression that Laurie Strode has been through her whole life and is definitely sad to watch. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a strong performance as the horror character we all know and love and definitely gives us a sense of what the life of Laurie has been like, Another actress who gives a great performance is Andi MAtichak who is a newer actress playing Laurie Strodes daughter, Allyson Strode. Seeing three generations of Strodes all attacking Michael Myers who is still partly being played by Nick Castle is definitely very satisfying, It's definitely more gory than the original and was a little more than we all needed to see, but besides that it's a good sequel that all fans of the series, or just the original like me, should see.",

            "content": "40 years after John Carpenter's iconic horror film, we are greeted with a brand new instalment in Michael Myers' saga. It feels like a really special moment for horror fans, as we reflect on the original decades later. The opening credits pay homage to the 1978 and provide some nostalgia for long time fans by using the same text and soundtrack that audiences would've seen on the big screen back then. This was a great stylistic choice as it really gets you feeling pumped for what's to come.\n\nThe film opens with Myers in a high security facility, where two true crime podcasters attempt to communicate with him in order to learn more about him and the murders he committed. Unsurprisingly, Michael refuses to say anything, providing a seriously uncomfortable moment for the audience. Throughout the film, we don't see or hear him, and shots of him without the mask are always the back of his head. I would have been very disappointed if they'd decided to show his face throughout, as this sense of facelessness is something that's always scared me about him. He's a silent killer, never jumping out and screaming, but hiding in the shadows waiting to strike at any point. Most interactions with Myers are tense, uncomfortable and nail biting. His presence alone has that effect on you.\n\nAs ever, it was a joy to see Jamie Lee Curtis reprise her role as original Myers' victim, Laurie Strode. Throughout the film, Strode's paranoia is hard to brush off, and actually makes you feel more on edge. It was great seeing how she'd aged, yet refused to move on, and Curtis really brought her to life once again. She was the highlight of the film for me, as she was far from a cowering victim, and someone who wanted Myers dead for good. Having said that, you can tell how much she still fears him and how she's suffering with long-term PTSD after almost being murdered. Let's face it, anyone would feel the same way.\n\nUnfortunately, I did find some of the acting a bit cringeworthy and it took away from the overall experience. I know that horror films have a bit of a reputation for terrible acting and dialogue, but I felt like such an important franchise deserved better than that. In my screening there were a few laugh out loud moments, and I don't think all of them were intentional. One thing I will say is that child actor Jibrail Nantambu is one to watch because he was such a character and brought some genuine humour to the scenes he was in. I hope he goes far. Michael's handler Dr. Ranbir Sartain is also an interesting character that I won't say much about, but his development throughout is particularly great.\n\nAdmittedly I would've preferred less focus on teenagers, families and their dramas, and more on Michael and the actual kills. The film was meant to be about him and Laurie, after all. Whilst I was mostly satisfied by the brutality and some really gruesome moments, I felt it had been hyped up to the point where I expected more. Is that bad? Have I just become desensitised to bloody moments? I'm not quite sure. Having said that, one scene in particular did have me on the edge of my seat so it was still able to provide that adrenaline rush despite all its flaws. I'm still really bloody scared of Michael Myers.\n\nOverall, Halloween is certainly watchable and a great visit to the cinema, especially this evening. Whilst I'm not the world's biggest Halloween fan and there are certain films in the franchise I haven't even seen, I still enjoyed this and understood what was going on. If you're a big horror fan, particularly of the classics, give this a go. It might give you some welcome nostalgia and scares, and maybe that's enough.\n\nOverall, Halloween is certainly watchable and a great visit to the cinema.

The movie started well and it seemed that we would get a look into the dark soul of Michael Myers and why he was the monster he was, but after 30mins the film moved away from this premise and back to Myers killing spree, the film then revolves around Myers vs Laurie Strode ( acted brillantly by Jamie Lee Curtis),his demons vs her demons. Overall I enjoyed it, but think that they didn't explore all the avenues that they teased in the first half of the film. A Film that I would say go see if you enjoyed the original but could have been a classic as well.",

Its weaknesses lie not with the film itself but with the inferior gorefest rip offs that have come since the original installment. The film's horror lies in the pyschology and trauma of its leading characters and the clash of Myers and Strode is one for the ages. Jamie Lee Curtis gives new dimensions to a character that has since become eclipsed, much like Halloween itself, to lesser iterations of the 'last girl' archetype. Her protrayal of the hard as nails survivalist survivor struggling with PTSD is remarkable and she alone raises the callibre of the film. I hope to see an extended version where the pyschological themes are explored in depth. But, until then, go see this film!",

I'm happy he dosen't speak but don't build it up and then have nothing to show for it, then there was no need to have it in the movie in the first place. \n\nWtf is up with the coboyhat wearing Sheriff Barker? He says roughly \"So you mean Michael Myers and 30 mental patients are running loose on halloween? But what are we going to do, cancel halloween haha\" What real life sheriff would not take this seriously? \n\nLauries daughter rejects Laurie when she tells her that Myers is free, but in the end seems like she always was aware of the danger and even shows that she is prepared by playing her self of as defensless and then shoots him with a \"got ya\". I'm aware that she was trained as a kid and is trying to forget this. But if she knew deep down, why did she not go with Laurie , why did she reject her mother while knowing the danger Myers posed, endangering other lives wich got her husband killed in the process. \n\nThe halloween music was IMO over used and the reveal music (like when his reflection showed up in the window) was pointless becaus we friggin saw him walking up to the window!",

There's a serviceable \"Halloween II\" that features Jamie Lee Curtis. We've already had a self-aware \"Halloween\" film that ignored several sequels and jammed an older Curtis at us. The reason this film exists is that it knows you liked seeing Michael fall off a balcony and then not be there when you looked back, so it's going to do that again with a slight twist. YOU LIKE SEEING THE FAMILIAR SO GIVE US MONEY. I suppose this wouldn't bother me if this was a legitimately good film, but it's barely passable.

Disappointed doesn't even go far enough in describing how I came out of the theater after suffering through this one; I almost walked out early.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis does a decent job reprising her role as a 40-years aged, PSD-version of Laurie Strode.  Nick Castle also reprises The Shape, but his movements seemed to have changed from the original.  All other characters weren't very well developed.  I don't want to drop any spoilers here, but about three quarters of the way through the film, most will exhale in disgust at the nonsensical twist.  Halloween 2, widely accepted as a poor sequel, is actually better than this film.\n\nThe movie takes a while to get started.  The plot doesn't seem to follow a logical path.  Michael's kills seem sporadic and forced, while a couple seem to be gaping departures from physical science and reality.\n\nAs much as I loved the original - still do - and kept hoping for sequels to pay a respectful homage to the one that started it all, I can truly say I hope Michael's dead and gone now.",

And the primary reason to that is the uncertainty that was kept alive in the original installment, that is clearly the missing puzzle in here. Although, Green does get few gigs right. And by right, I mean, bang on bucks. There are few jaw dropping revelations that can leave you shook and make you think twice before moving ahead. But that's as much as thinking you are about to get in here. It takes steps that are more harrowing then the previous one even ever dared to do so. And yet it still isn't that sinister as the original one. Probably, because of the innocence and the rawness that is left untouched in this one.\n\nThe narration is gripping and adaptive but isn't layered or thought provoking as it was anticipated. And as far as answers are concerned you are still left under the shades, all the ones that were essential, were given in the '78 version of Carpenter's. The editing and the conversations, at times makes it a bit spooky and sketchy and not on terms of the genre but on terms of the practicality that it attempts to achieve. The silent pitches that used to create the glass cutting tense environment on the screen, is a big void waiting to be filled. The horrors and screams seems manipulative and most of the time is spent upon creating obvious close calls that aren't going as expected. Green is a good filmmaker and there are clear signs of that.\n\nBut it takes a much more evil mind to create the perfect horror, and that is something that can neither be learnt or taught, it comes natural and unfortunately Green doesn't have it in him. Curtis is back on the suit except this time it is armored with guns blazing on both the shoulder. She is hurt and evolved with starry eyes that can kill anyone. She oozes power to a point where it creates catastrophe on others lives too, and mind you, this character that may look bad and rough on the outer surface and is actually soft on the inner side, doesn't actually go as one might think. Greer is convincing but the rest of the supporting cast doesn't get anything beyond your stereotypical pawns of a horror genre.\n\nThe sound effects are sharp and also at times a but loud, but since Green uses it as a tool in a narration especially when he has to transition from one scene to another, it works for the most part of it. The upgraded background score on the original version by Carpenter himself, is astonishing and breathtaking that creates a dreadful impact among the viewers. Halloween is a decent feature as both an individual and a sequel, but its existence is somewhat questionable and to listen to Green for around two hours for him to convince you for its reasons that are justified, seems a bit of a stretch.",

            "content": "Happy Halloween.  So 40 years have passed since the infamous babysitter murders.  Michael Myers has been apprehended and locked away at a rehabilitation hospital.  He is being transferred to new facility, so let's hope nothing happens on the bus ride over.  Now I am a big fan of the original Halloween, even though it is not something I watch religiously.  I haven't seen any of the sequels or the Rob Zombie reboot so I don't have a ton of experience to go off of.  I do recognize that the first movie catapulted the slasher subgenre to a whole new level and I do also acknowledge how cool it is to be watching Halloween on Halloween, October 31st, so of course I jumped at the opportunity.  So how is the 2018 installment?  Well, it has been a long time since I've had this much fun watching a horror movie in a theater.  Other than the degree that this entertains, one of the biggest surprises about this has to be that Danny McBride is one of the writers on this (yes, that Danny McBride).  It is one thing to write fan fiction, but he is a genuine fan and you can tell that he wanted this to be good.  To give credit where it's due, this features a really solid script.  It keeps the story moving with the quickness, and there are even full breaks for joke exchanges, which is exactly what this movie calls for.  The pacing is dynamite, and this is a really lean movie, and I mean that in the best way possible; it's 100 minute long movie if you subtract the credits, and there is no fat to chew on, so none of your valuable time is wasted.  It knows why its fans are here, but it also knows when to pull back.  They know that the audience is going to leave far happier with just the threat of something bad happening instead of actually witnessing the dismemberment of a child.  I don't think that they ever gave a good reason for why Michael Myers only tries to kill certain people and not everybody, but I do think all of the choices that they made were the correct ones.  I really had a blast watching this, and I think it is good horror fun from start to finish.  My biggest gripe about this has nothing to do with the actual movie itself: the trailers to this give too much away in the scares.  There are a number of sequences that are setup exceedingly well, but they were undercut due to me already knowing how it was going to play out.  The iconic music is back and great as always, and I think die hard fans and casual genre fans alike are both going to really dig this.",

For the hardcore fans, you must forget any sequels after the original 1978 version (most of them crappy) because this takes place 40 years after the the first film. This horror slasher is a nice throwback to some of the good horror flicks of the late 70s and early 80s. Yes it has cliches, but have you ever seen a horror movie where people DON'T make stupid decisions and end up dead? It goes hand in hand with the genre. \n\nThe movie is surprisingly not as gory as I thought it would be, but that helps in this instance, because it gives more impact and feeling to the eventual gory scenes. The plot is also straight to the point: paranoid, but badass NRA loving Jamie Lee Curtis (doing her best Terminator 2 Sarah Connor impression) and her family vs Michael Myers while many victims get in the way. People who love \"over the top home invasion defense\" scenes will love this too. The soundtrack was good too which makes sense given its the same production company as the Purge, Sinister, Insidious, and Conjuring films.\n\nAlways been more of a fan of Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street but this was a good horror flick to watch on Halloween or in a dark room with your (jumpy) significant other.

            "content": "This week I'd hoped to post a review for the new 'HALLOWEEN'. However, I'm foregoing that experience and subsequent review in lieu of its Box Office success last weekend and the attributed boasts of the number of 'apparent' records it'd broke according to a 'Tweet' on Sunday, Oct. 21st by Jamie Lee Curtis: 1. 'Biggest horror movie opening with a female lead.' (Don't all horror films have a female lead?) 2.  'Biggest movie opening with a female lead over 55.' (Is this a thing? Either way, doesn't this 'achievement' apply 'within' first proclamation?) 3. 'Second biggest October movie opening ever,' (NOTE: a 'Second' place biggest-opening is not a milestone.) 4. Biggest 'Halloween' - from which, I assume she means, 'of the entirety of the franchise' - opening ever; (This one's debatable.) Yet, lastly - and most nauseating - lies within her conclusion, that 5. hashtag (#) 'WomenGetThingsDone'. (Rather pretentious and pompous statement - if not entirely inaccurate: as, having been filmed by a male, starring a reoccurring male villain - featured in 10 sequels or adaptations since the original - created by John Carpenter (male) forty-years ago.\nThus, of her conclusion - in this current pop-world desperately seeking to balance an invisible equality boundary - these conjectured achievements were realized solely under the attribution of entrepreneuring females. \nSorry Mrs. Curtis, but the success of the film is of one reason, and one reason only; that being that, #MichaelMeyersGetsThingsDone.    \nA few weeks prior to the release of the new 'Halloween' film, a major news channel was criticized for calling Jamie Lee Curtis a 'hypocrite' for toting and expelling a gun against her on-screen adversary despite her on-going petition against the second amendment of the United States Constitution.   \nThe overwhelming rebuttal was justified as 'It's just a Movie.' \nHere's the deal. If you're one of celebrity position with an agenda to abolish an American right, you cannot walk the fine-line of the debate solely in the name of art. You must uphold the presentation of your opinion in art as equally as you claim in waking life. Therefore - in this instance of Mrs. Curtis, to abolish the second amendment - you have one of two options of artistic license. Either show us the positive effect of what a world without guns looks like, or portray the extreme opposite, taking up the role of a rouge psychopath, taking out everyone, in a world where everyone has access to guns; guns bought and sold to everyone like candy to kids, and everyone dies...therein the attempt to justify your crusade. \n\nWhat you don't do, is take 'one' gun, and shoot 'one' guy who's trying to kill you. As by portraying such a victim shooting an intrusive (albeit fictional) masked adversary only warrants the fact of our right to defense.  \nThus, rather than feeding this allusive equality seeking machine, I'd opted to stay home instead and watch the original 'John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN' on VHS. The way it should be. Which hits a heavy 10 out of 10.\n- A.M. Rorabeck, 'The Weekend Fizz, CLINTON COURIER, 10/26/18",

            "content": "\"Happy Halloween, Michael\".\n\nForget Jigsaw and Paranormal Activity, because The Shape is back and he's taking back Halloween.\n\nAt first I wasn't sure what to expect when hearing rumors of a remake or reboot of this worn out franchise, which should've stopped in 1978. Heck, even when this was announced, I rolled my eyes. However, my interest peaked when Jamie Lee Curtis would be reprising the role as Laurie Strode and Nick Castle as Michael Myers. The new creators made it clear this is a continuation of the original, not a reboot. Plus John Carpenter returning to composer new music for the film. Everything was set and this quickly became my most anticipated movie of fall. And the results are quite interesting.\n\nHalloween (2018) is a lot of fun and a solid return to form. Not great, just good. There are flaws and some wasted potential, especially having an identity crisis. However, it will satisfy any Halloween fan for how well they respected the source material and the characters - erasing the sequels that came before it. With all the different interpretations over the years following Carpenter vision, yet I can say David Gordon Green followed it up closely.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis is absolutely fantastic in this movie and probably gives the best performance of her career. Judging from the promotional material, I initially thought it's going for the trope of strong \"hard as nails\" female lead without any character. Nothing could be further from the truth. We instead get a powerful look on trauma, especially the dinner table scene. This only transforms her into a strong and bad-ass lead with a fantastic character arc. By the end, she's not the victim anymore.\n\nMichael is back and brutal than ever. A nasty force of nature and the film works wonderfully whenever his on screen. More in line with Rob Zombie's version in terms of how he kills. Even when you don't fully see the kill, it's the sound work and the aftermath that leaves a horrific sight. And you feel bad for some of the victims, as the film at least gives some of them a character before biting the dust. It's more terrifying with no context for his killings that the sequels, to put it bluntly, \"f**ked up\". You really do get the sense that he is, purely and simply, evil.\n\nDavid Gordon Green, best known for comedies and also dramas like \"Joe\" and \"Stronger\", not forgetting those two. Him and Danny Mcbride, a comedy duo, making a new Halloween movie is something you never thought would happen. I mean, if you ask me seven years ago when \"Your Highness\" came out, that these guys future project will be the next Halloween - I would stare at you in awe for how crazy you sound - now here we are. What stood out to me is how Gordon Green went old school and made the wise choice of keeping Michael in the shadows. When unmasked, it's hard to make out his face. I also liked the reverse-parallels to the original film. This being his first horror movie, I thought this was a good attempt.\n\nThe new score from John Carpenter is the highlight of the film. The mix of retro and modern flawlessly blended. \"Michael Kills Again\" and \"The Shape Hunts Allyson\" are instant classic. I know there's no chance of it winning, but I hope this soundtrack at least gets nominated for best Original Score at the Oscars.?\n\nSadly, this is where my problems come in. The second act is devoted to Laurie's granddaughter and some weak teenager drama that I couldn't care less for. Along with her friends who are just bait for Michael. We're wasting time watching these characters while the most compelling element of the film is brushed aside.\n\nThe comedic aspects didn't work for me. I didn't laugh at any of the humor, as it took away the suspense. When you get a scene with two police officers in a car talking about their lunch or get a line like \"I got peanut butter on my penis\", it doesn't fit the tone. As I said early, this suffers from an identity crisis.\n\nAlso Dr. Sartain (Michael's doctor) is literally one of the worst characters in the movie. Without spoiling anything, but the shift in character comes out of nowhere and the reasoning behind it is ridiculous. Nothing good came out of it.\n\nI wish the tension and suspense was heightened up during scenes when it was needed. Because Michael seems to appear in places with no build up. No shots of him waiting or stalking, just the striking. The finale felt a bit rushed and anticlimactic, in my opinion.\n\nOverall rating: Despite the flaws, I still think this is a solid movie and worth checking out.\n\nHappy Halloween everyone!",

            "content": "As much as people hate remakes or just sequels in general, I enjoyed this film. It had that uneasy feeling through out the whole movie and gory kills none of the less. All though it had it's cons. Ignoring the plain awful decisions the characters made simply because the fact that it's now a cliche in horror movies and one apparently can't be made without them. The bus crash seemed too simple, how could he over power the guard if he was chained down, assuming he was, which would make sense since they were presumably one of the worst mental patients that we have seen being chained down even with guards present inside the hospital. Long story short it was highly unlikely or atleast over simplified. The other thing that bothered me was the unnecessary kills. Understanding the mind of Michael, he wanted to kill the one who got away and the people who got in the way. So why did he kill the first lady? I guess it was for the knife but still and the next one was just for the effect. It felt that the directors wanted to add a gory kill to harden the stereotype of \"more kills=better horror movie\" even if that might not be the case anymore. We could justify those kills claiming it was a part of Michael's plan; was it really though? It felt rather spontaneous. \nI did enjoy the last part. Her disappearing from Michael and her daughter acting helpless but actually faking it. But for a women that has been preparing for this her whole life, she seemed quite off, more so her aim. \nAt the end the movie was good. It was better than I was expecting. It wasn't another failed reboot, but a promising sequel that kind of redeemed the horrible supernatural money hungry over cliche movies in the middle.",

The atmosphere resembles that of the 1978 classic, while making note of the societal changes that have occurred over the last 40 years. The strength of this film is the impending confrontation between Lauri Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her attacker/brother, Michael Myers. The supporting cast is adequate but they don't bring much substance to the story, and are mostly forgettable characters that are used as convenient plot devices and to fill the audience in with clunky exposition. Luckily, Curtis is still able to carry the bulk of the movie on her shoulders, as she resurrects the terrorized, yet strong lead character that made the original film such a classic. Michael Myers is more savage and barbaric in this film, aimlessly killing most anyone that crosses his path without a clear sense of rhyme or reason. Much like the original, the final act is the strongest and most intense part of the film, and the final result is mostly satisfying. Director David Gordon Green does not try to reinvent the wheel here, he provides us a basic, yet effective slasher movie that is able to stand on its own two feet the entire time. In my opinion, this is the best out of the Halloween sequels, and finishes a distant second to the original source material. I think most Halloween fans, as well as horror fans in general, will appreciate the effort made here to bring another classic Halloween film.",

The simplicity, the music, the relentlessness, and suspense defined a lifetimes worth of slasher movies both good and bad. So where does Halloween (2018) stack up...? Fortunately it captures alot of the same pillars of that foundation where the scariest moments are waiting and wondering when and where Michael Myers might show up. It is sped up for modern audiences which ends up ratcheting up the body count and to some degree even speeds up his overall presence. Losing a little bit of the methodical slow stalking approach that made the original so good. But still captures the essence and spirit to be really good. \n\nI miss Loomis and what he represents to the original and they unfortunately don't make up for it anywhere else in the film. And it exposes the lost opportunities in the film, with the documentarians uncovering nothing and seemingly have a pointless conversation with little or no depth with Laurie Strode and an initial nothing burger at Smith Grove. And speaking of Laurie... completely underutilized here. When you have an actress as good as Jamie Lee Curtis I want more depth and I wanted more. I felt like she could have been the Loomis of the film and really told a story from a slightly different perspective than he did while still saying \"no you don't understand this guy is evil\". To make it worse there is a complete misfire with his new therapist. I want spoil anything here but I could have done without this guy and the plot he represented.\n\nSo despite the challenges in the film I go back to what makes the original Halloween so special music, simplicity and relentlessness without a ton of pretense. It delivers on that promise. You have to suspend a little disbelief in all the sequels and the extravagance of decades of formula based slasher films sit back and allow yourself to be scared by really the OG stalker/slasher with all due respect to Norman Bates.",

She loved it as well and we became horror movie buddies for  life, for us the new Halloween is like the Circle of Life. When directors and writers deliver on this scale it is magnificent, we spend the movie just letting all the nuances, tie ins, twists wash over us with glee. Kudos to everyone involved for all you horror buffs this will deliver on a grand scale and as a end note it's great to see a franchise know when it's time to finish. Well done John and Emily G",

            "content": "Halloween (2018) Review: Halloween is the reboot of the famous 1978 of the same name. I was intrigued to see this only because last years horror movie remake, IT, did well. I enjoyed this movie but not as much as I thought I would. It was a good concept but not really original. It only regarded the first two movies of the franchise and disregarded the others. It centers around Laurie Strode, Jamie Lee Curtis, and her family as Michael Meyers escapes prison and comes after her on Halloween night 40 years later. Jamie Lee Curtis was really good in this movie. Judy Greer as Karen was fine, I\u2019m not a big fan of her but she\u2019s fine. Those were probably the only standouts for me. The plot would\u2019ve been better if there weren\u2019t so many unnecessary side plots. There\u2019s a short side plot with two podcasters that was so unnecessary. If you really think about it the only served one key plot point in the whole thing. There\u2019s also a small part concerning Michael\u2019s psychiatrist and that was one of the dumbest parts. Karen\u2019s daughter, Allyson, played by Andi Matichak, was fine. She\u2019s in high school so there\u2019s some high school stuff that\u2019s unnecessary too. The ending was a little disappointing to me. There\u2019s also an after credit scene and you could already tell before the movie what they\u2019re going to do. The scares were fine, though this movie really wasn\u2019t scary at all. They tried doing more jump scares which I thought was dumb because the format of a jump scare goes like this: you can tell it\u2019s coming, you jump, you laugh at yourself for jumping kind of. Could\u2019ve been more real scares than cheap ones. One thing I really liked was that they recreated scenes from the original but some were just opposite or with different people. They score was like the original and John Carpenter, the original director, composer, and writer of the first film, did the score and I liked it. The film really captured nostalgia at certain parts. The cinematography was good. Overall this was an entertaining movie with a great performance by Jamie Lee Curtis. It could\u2019ve been better however. I think most people would like this movie though. It\u2019s another movie to watch around Halloween. My Grade: B-",

School dance plot and boyfriend plot for the granddaughter has no place being here. Hate that the whole movie we see Laurie being prepared but in the final battle she ends up acting like she has no clue what she\u2019s doing for the sake of run time.

The versatile director David Gordon in thinking about his film decided not to take into account all previous Hallowens, except for the first of 1978 - best of all - his screenplay is a direct continuation of the first feature, turning 40 years later, where Michael Myers escapes from the rehab center and returns to hunt Laurie Stronde, the survivor of the first film's slaughter. It's a shame the film's impact is completely nil because we are no longer living the Golden Age of Slasher Movies, a story so ingrained in pop culture in the end to end up without much expression, but David deserves our recognition for catching a dead genre and giving some air of novelty and nostalgia in him, as I said, Hallowen has several problems, of continuation, problems of cuts and even problems of acting and photography. The film sometimes does not know which way to go, sometimes the length is brutal, sometimes it is not, sometimes the gore is exaggerated other times it is not present, but not every technical and artistic part is bad, as we have the classic trail chilling and nostalgic sound in the movie that is well used and also the actress Jamie Lee commands well as \"Laurie\".

When the sheriff sees Michael walking on the side of the street, he seemingly runs him over without a second thought that it's Halloween night and some innocent person could easily be dressed up as Michael, he's also never unmasked to verify his identify during an absolute meaningless plot twist involving a character that dies several minutes later anyway. The main character turns her home into a military fortress. It is fixed with perimeter fences, bolted doors, a cabinet full of guns, massive flood lights surrounding her home, security cameras, a basement saferoom, and steel shutters to close off every room to her home. Yet it seems with 40 years of preparation for Michael's escape and a personal fortress, she was not prepared in the slightest. When she knows he's on his way to her home, she never uses her numerous security cameras to track his movements. She doesn't use the flood lights until AFTER he's in her home. She puts her face up against her front door, allowing the antagonist to easily break his fist through fragile glass and smash her face into the front door. For some reason she's also able to put up a fight against someone with superhuman strength. She doesn't shut off the rooms in her house, until he's in her house.  The main character seems to be a complete moron although the audience is led to believe she's a complete badass who seems 1000% prepared to murder the antagonist. They also trap him and fill their entire basement up with gas, and ignite it, with themselves still inside. And miraciously that does not blow the house to pieces or injure anyone. Also, don't bother staying after the credits cause there's no scene but they lazily inserted sounds of him breathing to let you know he's still alive but they didn't wanna invest the money into actually showing it.",

The great flash back references to the origina,l the gore, the violence, the same old mike Meyers us true horror fans love no sci-fi bs just a straight mass killing by one of the most iconic serial killers out there. Don't listen to these random people's opions like the old disillusioned roger ebert or some female who probably was scared by \"Annabelle\" or the new crap horror out now. This is a great comeback for the franchise. From the decayed pumpkin at the beginning resurrecting, to the parts where Jamie Lee dissapears after a double look by mike just like the old days where he was gone after she double checked I highly recommend it.

            "content": "A TRICKY TREAT - My Review of HALLOWEEN (3 1/2 Stars)\n\nThere's something exciting about the fact that the original HALLOWEEN from 40 years ago has a sequel of the same title which ignores the not-great, countless sequels in between.  I mean, I barely care about this new one, so it's hard to acknowledge that anything memorable happened after the first one.  For those who forgot John Carpenter's first, Halloween night finds a group of horny teenagers picked off one by one by Michael Myers, a knife-wielding, seemingly indestructible psychopath in a haunting white mask. In the end, Laurie Stode (Jamie Lee Curtis) our final girl, one of the endless tropes this film seems to have spawned, cowers in terror as Myers disappears into the night to haunt her forever,  \n\nAs the new film, directed by the very capable David Gordon Green, opens, in a beautifully tense sequence, two English podcasters attempt to interview Myers, who has been chained up inside an asylum.  When an exposition dump announces his imminent transfer to another facility, we know for a fact that it won't go well for anybody but Mr. Myers.  Our podcasters, a delightfully soooo English Rhian Rees and Jefferson Hall, move on next to attempt to interview Strode, who has holed herself up in a compound likely to make even the Unabomber jealous.  The veritable poster child for PTSD, Strode only has time for her guns, her well-stocked hidden basement, and her constant warnings to her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and grandchild Allyson (Andi Matichak).  While Karen wants no part of her mother's paranoid delusions, Allyson  remains sympathetic.  \n\nGood thing, because, not a big spoiler here Michael escapes and returns to terrorize our peaceful little hamlet on...duh...Halloween.  What follows is set piece after set piece of brutal murders and narrow escapes.  You've seen it all before.  Even THE WALKING DEAD opened with the killing of a child, so when it happens here, it's not as shocking.  Although did they really need to code the first child victim as \"gay\"?  Green and his co-writers Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley didn't really need to go there, but I must say the child actors in this kinda kick ass.  \n\nThere's not much else to the movie, although Curtis really excels here.  Once a scream queen, she's now a full-bodied warrior filled with vivid neurotic tics and a roar instead of a screech.  Greer and Matichak also do wonderful work, helping show three generations of trauma perpetrated by one nasty bogeyman.  In fact, more than the original, this film find its heart in its exploration of trauma.  It also has a callback moment to the original (you'll know it when you see it) which caused a spontaneous eruption of applause from the Writers Guild audience. The Writers Guild audience applauded.  They don't like anything.  Let that one sink in.  \n\nThat moment is actually more than just a callback.  It allows this new HALLOWEEN to stand on its own as a film about a victim becoming the monster, the cycle of violence passed on from one to another.  There's another callback shot a few minutes later which solidified this theme, reversing the positions of two main characters.  In the end, it's still a slasher film, but with good kills in a filthy bathroom and looking through the window of a suburban home.  Green adds his own loose, indie style to give the film a little more real feel and adds a true point of view.  It won't change the world, but it goes down much better than candy corn.",

Laurie spent 40 years prepping for this moment, and then when she has multiple opportunities to kill him she fails.  I guess it would be a 20 minute movie if she killed him first try.  Also, Mike seems to be indestructible to the point of being laughable.  I did like some of the scenes that were copied from the 1978 classic, except the tables were turned.  In this movie, Laurie falls out a window just like Mike did, camera pans away, goes back to the body and she's gone.  That was cool.  Some of the kills were good, but all in all the movie had a bit too much of the \"teen slasher\" vibe...I could have done w/out the dance and making out on the couch...kinda cheapened the movie.  I always look forward to Blume House movies because they're always top notch (Get out, Sinister, The Purge, Happy Death Day, Insidious, Split)...this one failed to deliver.",

To start my opinion is completely unbiased, i have no experience with any of the previous titles, this was my first. The story starts out very strong, building up some tensity between this alluring bogeyman, michael, and his family, who have struggles within their bonds. Somewhere halfway through the movie though, any mystery to be solved is ditched, and never explained. Michael kills simply because. It is never explained. The characters are unrealistically incompetent, its hard to believe you only see about 6 car cops the entire movie (all in different scenes) when it was broadcasted that a mass serial killer is loose in a neighborhood, and had accounted an incredulous amount of casualties. The conclusion is empty and shallow, and feels like the project was rushed out by the end, and left me feeling disappointed, wanting more. Underwhelmed. The beginning lured me in, but then lost me by the end. Decent kills, so if you want a halloween movie to play in the background of a party, this will do, but dont expect there to be any more depth than that from this movie.",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS *\nThis is a challenging movie to review. On one hand, I am extremely happy to be able to see Michael Myers butcher a group of teenagers in a cinema. As a kid who was really into 80's movies, this was all I wished for. On the other hand, I have watched hundreds of movies since that period of my life, and the slasher genre is far from the most interesting thing going on in today's cinema. That doesn't mean that it can't be enjoyed for what it is: a fun, nostalgic and overall competent popcorn flick.\nThe Halloween franchise has tried many things since the original movies, very few of them sucessfully, so it's only natural that David Gordon Green tried to stay true to the original John Carpenter movie.\nFrom predictable deaths to cheesy scenarios involving horny teenagers, it has it all. And while this may look like a weakness, it probably is not. It may not be a smart movie, but it is a very fun slasher that plays to its strenghts very well.\nThe highlights are Jamie Lee Curtis' Lauren Strode and Nick Castle's Michael Myers, that look as convincing in their roles as they did 40 years ago. Strode, now a old and scarred (but not defenseless) woman, is a likeable protagonist, and her change of attitude suits the tone of the story very well, and it's nice to see the victim step up to Myers, for once. Michael is as chilling as ever, and his advanced age doesn't seem to have affected his thirst for blood. His cold blooded brutality is in full display in this movie, with a couple of somewhat shaky but entertaining fights and a dozen of executions. His steps, his walking, his hits - everything seems real. Myers looks like he could be seen walking the other side of the road from your window, and that's one of the reasons he is so terrifiyng. That, combined with a seemingly senseless and uncompreensible need to kill, makes him a formidable villain, just like he was in the original Halloween.\nThe acting is serviceable, with Jamie Lee Curtis being great, as usual. The characters are all good and believable, with the obvious exceptions of the pair of forensic reporters and Dr. Ranbir Sartain, who seem straight out of every single 80's horror movie ever. The same can be said by a good bunch of the teenagers in the movie, but their roles are close to nonexistent. The movie's biggest flaw might be its ending, which is bitter-sweet, to say the least. The demise of Michael Myers feels fitting: burned to death, traped in a hellish basement, and maybe as scared as his victims. However, the viewer never gets to SEE him dying, which is far from satisfying, and leaves the door opened to an honestly unwanted sequel.\nOverall, Halloween is a fun and harmless horror movie to enjoy with friends and a couple of beers. It won't win any Oscars, but that wasn't the point of the movie to begin with.",

HOW?!?! he opens the door and you can clearly see everything well lit in the car. plus the way he had the flashlight in dude's severed head, he would have had to remove the brain, tongue and all tissue from his head. he looked like he did it with surgical precision.\n\nthe dad discovered said dead cops because he was chilling outside. just hanging out. when there is a murderer on the loose. when the grandma is inside turning off all the lights. scolding her daughter for having the light on. but hanging out outside? no problem. \n\nand the best part? the \"twist\" rofl rofl. the mom tells the grandma about the underground layer being \"a cage.\" grandma responds it's not a cage. later the daughter gets there, goes underground, and for some random reason cries \"i'm in a cage.\" .....  ....... like..... for real? once michael meyers is down there, they close the bars on the entrance and light the room on fire to kill him. the mom tells the daughter \"it's not a cage, it's a trap!\" lolololololololololololololololol. i yelled OMG. also, once you block the entrance with bars, it actually kind of is a cage right? smh horrendous. oh and right before that, the grandma said \"happy halloween michael\" and stabbed him. just wow",

This movie doesn't try anything new and unlike the original movies at a snails pace allowing John Carpenter to cover up a few of the scripts weaknesses.  This new version moving at a slow pace allow thoughts to creep into my head like how does Michael Myers know how to drive?  Or read?  Having been locked up most of his life he would have the education of a 6 year old.  6 year old kids barely know their ABC's let alone read.  Having been locked up the past 40 years he'd be unfamiliar with new technological advances.  People have security systems now ...well except most of the people in this town.  You'd think that a town famous for the \"baby sitter murders\" would have most of the citizens with security systems.   I'd wager that the folks in TexArkana sure do.  The problem with this movie is that it needs people to be stupid to advance the plot and allow Michael Myers to go on a killing spree.   The most egregious thing the movie does is try to emphasize the randomness of the killings.  Really?  REALLY?  Then why the fuck does Michael Myers go back to Hadenville and try to kill Laurie Strode again.  The script is so stupid that it doesn't realize it is negating it's own premise.",

With that in mind, this 2018 incarnation of the 40 years old franchise is a decent, thought through and well executed genre film that should satisfy its core target audience and then some. The bravest and most original thing the script by David Gordon Green, Jeff Fradley and Danny McBride does is to rip out all the previous sequels and reboots and continues only from the original 1978 film, thus de-cluttering the franchise and avoids unnecessary plot gymnastics and contrivances. This script still finds itself squarely in conventional genre territories but is now updated for 2018. The mortality rate is much higher for those with the Y chromosome as they are dispatched in a more graphic and brutal manner than that of the female victims which are often less gratuitously bloody or done off-screen via sound effects. And then there's the central cross-generational trio of female protagonists led by the return of Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode (again), who is fully prepared to turn the table by making the hunter the hunted. For cineastes and genre fans, the most fun to be had is in the spotting of homages and references to the original film and the franchise. From the grainy titles to John Carpenter's eerie score to the knowing re-staging of notable scenes from previous films, they show a passion and attention that were sorely missing before. Judged on its own merits, this is a solid genre film that no doubts delivers, and most surprisingly, coming from a director who is known more for films such as Stronger and Pineapple Express.",

The lead women have all these kick ass combat skills, whereas the men couldn't find their own asses with map. The plot meanders aimlessly, like Michael Myers, from scene to scene.

            "content": "Michael Myers is the glass-ceiling-breaker of the modern slasher genre. Freddy, Jason, Ghostface, Chucky; these iconic figures owe their existence to John Carpenter's 1978 classic. But where many of those monsters have grown into obscurity or dated camp, the unstoppable force of evil that is Halloween's hero/villain is as striking and haunting as it was 40 years ago. With this 2018 sequel, Myers imposing shape and menace is on full display, even if the movie itself pales in comparison to its timeless predecessor.\nWriter/director Green opted to ignore all 10 previous series' entries, using only the original as a basis for his story. Myers has been institutionalized for 40 years, Lauri Strode is a doomsday prepper, and the town of Haddonfield looks back on that infamous Halloween night with fable-like disinterest...until, of course, Myers breaks out. There's a lot of OG Halloween mirroring, both ethereally (quiet, open space, slow-movement) and exactly (balconies, closets, resurrecting, the musical score). However, where the film works best is in its creative terror, when the filmmakers aren't so worried about honoring legacy and instead focus on screams. \nBut that legacy still casts a formidable shadow. When this one tries to recall the original, it works fine, but only in the way that great fan-fiction reminds us of what we already love; and when it breaks away from its inheritance (especially answers provided in the previous sequels), it leaves questions that aren't so much mysterious as they are frustrating. What's Michael's motivation? Why has Laurie not moved on even a tiny bit in 40 years? Still, despite plot-holes, lazy flashbacks, and clunky exposition, Halloween 2018 provides enough October-fun to warrant sitting among the Michael Myers' collection.",

            "content": "So, it\u2019s 40 years on for the release/escape of the iconic original and this being a direct sequel to it ignoring all the other previous sequels as if they never happened. However, there\u2019s enough respectful nods to the other sequels to keep fans happy; so much so I was pondering whether this was really a sequel or it a reboot. It\u2019s uses the original premise as a template with the something more-than-human, Michael Myers escaping prison and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield to simply gruesomely kill anyone who gets in his way. But where the plot fails with it\u2019s typical, idiotic decisions story\u2019s characters make. The estranged Laurie Strode and her family inevitably becomes the prime targets, but again, and glady so, Myers\u2019 motives are never really explained which only adds to his inherent evil. It\u2019s Myers\u2019 10th appearance in the movie franchise, which I think tops any other horror character besides classic monsters like Dracula and Frankenstein; and James Jude Courtney does a fine job of portraying the ruthless killer striking fear into anyone who is unfortunate to encounter him. And it\u2019s nice to see Nick Castle returns, repeating the first film with having more than one person play the man. And go Laurie Strode! Going from scream queen to all out badass that instantly reminded me of Terminator 2\u2019s Sarah Connor. Obsessed, delusional but right and well prepared, but I struggled to connect the two characters. Maybe in retrospect, Myers as a character hasn\u2019t change one bit whereas Strode has obviously had a life for 40years, been married, had a daughter and everything else that goes with it, so maybe I\u2019m being unfair. I can hardly expect a traumatised teenage woman. There\u2019s a better calibre of supporting cast who make great slasher fodder, meaning the budget was obviously higher with actors would actually play their part well. Patton, Greer, Gardner and Matichak provided believable performances with Bilginer\u2018s wannabe Dr. Loomis being the weakest and weirdest. But whilst Curtis and Myers\u2019 are the stars of the show, the rest of them do well to keep up with the pace and add a good up-to-date dynamic. There\u2019s some good cinematography and some nice classic touches with a couple of cheap jump scares, but where\u2019s the stalker vs prey vibe? Did I miss it? That daunting perspective through Myers\u2019 eyes. Instead there\u2019s much more gore and violence with some of it happening in the background; some of which I found more comical than horrifying. But there\u2019s much of the original here that should please any fan, especially the The Jack O\u2019Lantern opening credits and of course, Carpenter\u2019s iconic score. Is it a good horror? Not really, but is it a good Halloween movie? Yes, definitely. It\u2019s slightly flawed by being too much like the original in terms of simplicity but that\u2019s what makes this a good Halloween flick and is far superior than the other sequel/reboots we\u2019ve seen this year like The Predator.

            "content": "October 19, 2018\n\nI left \"Halloween\" (2018) scratching my head. What did I just see exactly? A sequel? An homage? A paltry imitation of a classic? I think it was all of the above, but I guess I'd have to sit down with director David Gordon Green and star Jamie Lee Curtis to know for sure. In any case, however they categorize this latest, 40th-anniversary installment of the immortal horror series, it doesn't matter, because in the end, it's not worth seeing.\n\nThis is all the more disappointing to admit precisely because of the director and star. I would have expected Green, who's primarily known for making offbeat, independent films such as \"George Washington,\" \"Undertow,\" and \"Prince Avalanche\" (with an occasional mainstream stinker here and there [\"Your Highness\"]), to put a fresher, more original spin on the horror genre, but oddly enough, he merely genuflects to its tired clich\u00e9s and conventions. And Curtis, who is a smart actress, seems okay with fulfilling such a limited and simplistic role. I thought this version of \"Halloween\" was going to be the one that brought integrity and excitement back into the fold (the franchise has been in dire need of it for quite some time), and although it's not as nearly awful as some of its predecessors, it's not good, either.\n\nA quick  note about its predecessors: as far as story continuity goes, this \"Halloween\" only recognizes John Carpenter's original classic of the same name from 1978 and \"Halloween II\" (1981), even though \"Halloween: H20\" (1998) and \"Halloween: Resurrection\" (2002), which were parts 7 and 8, both featured Curtis' Laurie Strode character, who died at the beginning of \"Resurrection.\" It pleased me to learn Green and his co-writers, Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley, penned a script that didn't unnecessarily recall bad movies. Instead, they opted to reimagine the mythology and make it their own. \n\nOnly they haven't, which is the problem. Fans of Carpenter's film will easily recognize the same exact shots and scenes Green's version overtly recycles, such as the heroine looking out the window at school and seeing an ominous figure staring back at her; or two kids who accidentally bump into the film's indestructible villain, Michael Myers, a.k.a. \"the boogey man\"; or the way Michael robotically picks up a hammer from a tool bench and bashes a woman's head in off-camera. These parallels are obviously intentional, but why? What was Green trying to accomplish or say by doing this, other than he can recreate the same movie?\n\nThe plot and characters are also rehashed, only they possess less dimension and spark this time around. The movie opens with two English podcast hosts (Rhian Rees and Jefferson Hall) visiting the mental hospital where Michael now resides. They're informed of his stoic, remorseless condition by Dr. Sartain (Haluk Bilginer), who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Dr. Lumis (Donald Pleasance), the psychiatrist who chased Michael in Carpenter's film. At one point, Laurie even says to Sartain, \"You're the new Lumis,\" as if this version is admitting it simply wants to copy the first \"Halloween,\" with the only difference being it's now 40 years later. \n\nAs the story goes, Michael escapes from the mental hospital during a patient transfer and makes his way back to Haddonfield, Illinois, the infamous doomed town where the first massacre occurred. Laurie, meanwhile, has never gotten over the trauma of that night. She now lives in a heavily fortified cabin in the woods, with a gate, security lights, monitors in every room, and an underground bunker with its own arsenal. Her compound is like a miniature boot camp. \n\nLaurie lives in constant fear and admits she's a basket case, which is something her estranged daughter Karen (Judy Greer) knows all too well. Both Karen and her husband Ray (Toby Huss) think Laurie is off her rocker, but their daughter Allyson (Andi Matichak), who calls Laurie \"Grandmother,\" wants Laurie to be more involved in her life. Allyson, you might say, is \"the new Laurie,\" and it's only a matter of time before Michael makes his way around town looking for her, and inevitably kills a fresh set of libidinous teenagers along the way. \n\nI wish I could say there's more to this new \"Halloween\" than that, but there just isn't, unless I'm missing something. It heeds every horror clich\u00e9 in the book, which, as it happens, Carpenter's film helped write. And I'm certain the filmmakers know they're doing this, but again I ask, why? Did they think time had made the stale formula fresh again? Did they think we'd actually care about the one-dimensional characters and see them as anything more than just would-be victims? Why even have supplemental scenes like the one at the high school dance, where Allyson catches her boyfriend (Dylan Arnold) kissing another girl? What do they accomplish? So much of what happens in this movie feels like filler, and frankly, it's dull.\n\nAs for the ending, it's a standard horror movie fare and nothing we haven't seen before, only Green drags it out, and it once again leaves open the possibility for another sequel (which is a horror clich\u00e9 in and of itself). Green and his team have made, or remade rather, a \"Halloween\" movie to be sure, complete with the usual plot, characters, locations and gruesome violence. But in their effort to recreate a classic, which seems to be their intention, they only managed to get the physical elements right and unfortunately left out the type of qualities that made the original \"Halloween\" a classic in the first place, things like mood, tension, a sense of unease, fresh ideas, excitement, interesting characters, scary situations. These are the virtues that made Carpenter's film, or any good movie, really come alive, and the fact they're missing from Green's explains why it's so dead in the water.",

What we see is a series of individual sequences, which are not connected with each other. You hardly ever see characters moving/driving/walking whatever from one place to another. There is no connection between places. Charakters just appear at a place, but you don't get an idea of their motivation to go there - or the explanation comes afterwards.

            "content": "40 years after the events of John Carpenter's original Halloween Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has been preparing for her final confrontation with The Shape, and when he escapes from captivity she finally gets her chance at revenge.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDavid Gordon Green helms this direct sequel to the original 1978 classic and you can tell that as well as being a sequel this is a love letter to the original written by fans of the franchise. Halloween is littered with visual and audial references to the original that add to the enjoyment for fans of the franchise but aren't at all jarring for someone who is coming fresh into the franchise. I love the callbacks from the various shots calling back to moments in the original to the presence of John Carpenter's iconic and still chilling theme. The story being told here is thrilling and a return to the slasher films of old but it's still very much in line with how a typical slasher film would progress. The pacing for the most part is pretty spot on, the first act has a couple of rough patches where it's a little up and down in the process of setting up Laurie and Michael's paths to cross. But once the second act kicks in it's a straight path to the finish line and it only gets better and more intense from there as Michael leaves behind a trail of blood and destruction.\n\nOnce I got a feel for the new characters and where things are heading I was hooked and on the edge of my seat right through to the end. The most engaging moments are those that focus on Laurie where you get to see what living in fear for 40 years does to a person and their family. How she's been training and what she is going through now that Michael is once again on the loose is a fascinating story point that I would have loved to even see a little more of. Some of the stuff revolving around Laurie's granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) I wasn't as highly invested in but I still found her journey in this story interesting.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe star of the show however is and will always be The Shape. Halloween is his night and he has waited 40 years to continue the killing spree he began and never got to fully see to its conclusion. This is his movie and watching Michael navigate the world leaving bodies in his path makes for a tonne of haunting fun. He's a terrifying figure looming in the darkness and you never know exactly when he's going to strike, but what you can be sure of is that it's going to take a lot to stop him. The way he is shot as he moves through this film is fantastic because you get enough of him but never so much that the camera is always fixed on him. Green makes this great creative decision where the camera is rarely focused on Michael, instead it's the house, the street, or the environment he is in that the camera moves through and Michael you always know is somewhere close by. It gives every scene this heightened suspense harking back to the tone of the original. The cinematography as a whole from Michael Simmonds is stellar with a number of well shot sequences standing out to me long after the credits began to roll. The confronting nature of how the brutal action sequences are shot is fantastic as it's all in line with the character and the regard he has for human life.\u00a0\n\n\n\nJamie Lee Curtis' return is one of the biggest draws of this sequel, seeing her jump right back into her most iconic role without the burden of the sequels weighing on her is awesome. And she plays the role so damn well, from the moment she first shows up on screen I'm like this is a very different Laurie Strode but an understandably different Laurie considering what she's gone through. She's gritty, intense, and determined to get her revenge and Jamie sold me on that in every one of her scenes. Judy Greer plays Laurie's daughter Karen and she has a good arc throughout the story in how it focuses on her fractured relationship with her mother but I did find her to be one of the least intriguing characters. She was fine as a secondary character I just wasn't as engaged in her journey as I was Laurie's or even Allyson's. Andi Matichak who plays Allyson is fine in the film, to be fair as the majority of the focus is on Laurie and Michael she doesn't have a whole lot to do but she puts in a good enough performance to where I wanted to see where some elements of her story went.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn the end, Halloween which is the direct sequel to Halloween (if that makes any sense) is a great slasher film that takes the franchise back to its roots and gives us the sequel we have deserved. It has a great story, brings in great new and returning characters, is a thrilling ride right to the end, and is about as good as I think a Halloween sequel can be after so many subpar attempts. Fans of horror should love this film which breathes new life into the now pretty dormant slasher genre without really bringing much new to the genre which is both confusing and impressive. It suffers from some early pacing issues and a couple of story arcs not being too engaging but overall is a thrilling story that doesn't disappoint. The Shape is still a brutal force of nature and it's worth checking out just to see him in action once again.\u00a0\n\n8/10",

The original Halloween is in just about every horror fans top 10 but since the movie made its debut in 1978 fans have had to make do with some very average sequels. It has taken 40 years to to this point in the series but i have to say it was worth the wait. This movie has hit the ground running and doesn't seem like its going to stop. The story is excellent and the acting is second to none, especially from the originals Jamie Leigh Curtis but for me the icing on the cake is John Carpenters re imagining of Halloweens original musical score. There is a scene in the movie where Michael appears in front of a large metal fence. He is then accompanied by a piece of music entitled \"The shape hunts\" At this point I looked around the packed cinema to witness nearly all my fellow movie goers almost in a state of trace as they were memorised by the haunting soundtrack an disturbing visuals. Not one person made a sound util the scene had ended. If you are a fan of horror or not, I still urge you to see this movie as the thrill ride it creates can be enjoyed by every one. OUTSTANDING !!",

Where do I start, well I can honestly say that Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job, but pretty much all the other characters were not that interesting, or annoying. They were trying to not show Michael face in this movie but I got a side profile and I was turned off immediately. Mystique gone! The kill scenes were alright but there were some dumb Wtf moments that I thought was not appropriate. The teens in this movie were pretty Beta, the boys were whiny bitches and the girls were not that interesting esp the main character. I really think that Hollywood is incapable of making movies with character development and likable characters any more. The fight scene with Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael was like five seconds long, not like the one in H2O. I actually found my self perfering H20 over this movie which is weird, because I never thought if was a good movie, but apparently it was better than this crap.  So ,my advice is skip it!",

I took .25 stars off because the first 25 minutes of the movie is very slow and boring.  I took an additional half a star off because I really hated the twist of Michaels psychologist causing the bus crash and killing the sheriff.  This was SO unnecessary and unbelievable!  Other than that, I loved this movie!!!\n\nI think Halloween's 4 and 5 were the scariest in the franchise's history and should have been left in - at least Halloween 4.  Halloween 5 got kind of wacky at the end, kind of like this one with the Michael's psychiatrist.  \n\nMy favorite kill was when Michael killed his psychiatrist.  That was a wicked scene.  He wakes up in the back seat of the sheriff's truck and smashes the shit out of him.  Then, Michael stomps his head in when the psychiatrist tells him, \"Say something!\"  I also liked when Michael killed the little fuck boy in the yard.  The flood lights go on, shut off, and he's closer, and then he's right there stabbing him.  Honestly, the most brutal killing was probably the guy who played with his mask in the truck stop.  That was hard to watch.  By the way, Laruie Strode's granddaughter's boyfriend who shot her phone in the pudding should have got killed too.\n\nI figured out the psychiatrist was up to no good when the sheriff arrived at the home where Laurie Strode's granddaughter was waiting after Michael killed the fuck boy in the yard and chased her granddaughter to that home.\n\nAllyson is the name of Laurie Strode's granddaughter.  I don't think she's going to become a killer.  I think she will carry the Michael Myers legacy from here.  She will have children and Michael will come back for her.\n\nI like Halloween as a Strode family saga.  I think that Laurie should still be Michael's sister.  I also believe that this movie makes it very difficult to move away from the Strode family saga in the future.",

I thought it had a good balance of staying true to the original simplistic concept whilst bringing up to date for a modern audience and critical fans. There were so many subtle references/symbols from the other Halloween films and being a fan I thought they were really well introduced without being cheesy or obvious. The mask was spot on...again staying true to the original. John Carpenters score was well thought out, scary when it needed to be and intriguing throughout which kept the suspense.

Forty years after Michael Myers terrorized and killed five people in Haddonfield, The Shape has re-emerged from the shadows after a group of people who are making a documentary about the Haddonfield murders triggered his mind to finish what he started back in 1978. But he's not alone as his surviving victim, Laurie Strode, has waited for a long time to put him down for good and protect the people she loves. Having the chance to watch the original Halloween forty years ago (and becoming a fan in the process). I was very surprised with how the latest entry in the long running, successful Halloween franchise turned out. This newest sequel which fully ignores the early sequels captures the spirit of the original Halloween since Halloween H20. When you look back at the previous sequels from the early 80s up to 2001, you can tell that this new Halloween film goes back to the roots of what made the original John Carpenter classic a big hit. Gone are the connections between Michael and Laurie as siblings along with keeping the Shape an enigma to everyone's mind, that means having no clear purpose on Michael's motivations which is one of the highlights of the original Halloween. What returned instead are the team behind this masterpiece from old and new faces as a way of introducing new audiences while also giving the die hard fans a proper chance to revive this dying franchise after the abysmal Halloween Resurrection sank its purity to the drain in favor of money for the greedy producers. What made this new Halloween film special is that it was produced by Jason Blum along with original director and composer John Carpenter with the latter acting as consultant on the narrative for this film and its future follow ups. This is not some money grubbing sequel, the new Halloween movie expands the lore of the original while also retaining the best aspects of what made the first movie a success from the camera work to the spectacular score of previous director, consultant, producer and now composer John Carpenter. This movie does a job to keep you on edge as what the original did. While the first Halloween relied on atmosphere and very few kills, this new film relies on some of those elements while also throwing new ones into the mix and balancing them at the same time. This movie has a higher body count and more gore all the while, it keeps the suspense on track and paying respect to the John Carpenter classic. There are so many scenes that combines suspense and brutality in the best way (The edgy opening scene which sets the tone of the whole movie, the gas station attack, the intense sequence where the bus transporting Michael crashes before killing two innocent folks, Michael walking the streets of Haddonfield before entering a couple of houses, the terrifying closet scene where Michael kills a babysitter, the scary emergency light backyard death scene, Michael killing his new therapist who has gone mad after killing the sheriff, Michael regaining consciousness after getting hit by a police car and the finale where Michael and Laurie face off at Laurie's turf). It is true that the Halloween films have become nothing but a disappointment with the later on sequels beginning with Halloween 4 to 6 and Halloween Resurrection. Now, with the rights back to John Carpenter and teaming up with Jason Blum. The franchise has been glorified for all the right reasons thanks to newcomer David Gordon Green behind the cameras with help from fellow collaborator Danny McBride, this made me fill my hopes up for the future of the Halloween franchise now that it is riding on a cart without skidding off the rails. As for the performances, the cast has done an amazing job with their work on this film. It's good to see two of the original Halloween actors reprise their roles from the original 1978 film. Jamie Lee Curtis is the big star of this film, as we see her character Laurie Strode evolve from a scared teen in the original who manages to fight back against her attacker to a tough as nails woman in this film who has awaited for forty years for her attacker to come back and put Michael down herself while struggling with her traumatic past forty years ago. Having Nick Castle reprise his role as the Shape is fantastic while new comers like Jurassic World, Carrie (2013) and Ant-Man actress Judy Greer is great for the role of Laurie's daughter. Director David Gordon Green has done a fantastic job in reviving this dying franchise after so many disappointing sequels including an inferior but not bad remake made by Rob Zombie. I was so interested to see how he takes the risk in going to new directions on what genre he should work on after making Drama and Comedy films. Being a new face in the Horror genre is a tough job for most filmmakers, but for Mr. Gordon Green. He faces the risk and challenges it in the best way with help from John Carpenter, Jason Blum and Danny McBride, I look forward to see with what he will do next with the future of Halloween. Overall, this new Halloween film is the best in the series thanks to its well executed reviving methods, respect to its previous lore while also opening the doors for new audiences who are new to this franchise and also welcoming back previous die hard fans who know these films for forty years. This film gets a 10/10.",

            "content": "The story of Laurie Strode and Michael Myers picks up 40 years after the events of 1978. Laurie has been suffering from PTSD ever since she escaped the wrath of Myers and is a survivalist who has an arsenal of weapons and traps loaded in her fortified home. Michael, on the other hand, has been locked up in a mental institution for the past 40 years (though the film fails to explain how Michael is captured following the first film) and is being transported to a new facility. To no one's surprise, Michael escapes custody while he's on a prison bus and proceeds to go on a killing spree while Laurie waits for her inevitable showdown with the evil that terrorized her 40 years ago. While it was a good decision to scrape the lore and events of the prior sequels, we are never informed as to how Michael was brought into custody or what events transpired after the ending of Laurie's initial showdown with Michael back in 1978.\n\nThe story is satisfying for a slasher film but there are some writing hiccups that hurt the movie. Most notably, there's several storylines and characters that are introduced in this movie that take up valuable screen-time and just take away focus from the movie's main story such as several high school scenes, a sheriff that's introduced but given practically no screen time, and a podcast duo that eat up the first 10 minutes of the film and are then brutally slaughtered. The movie's tendency to inject unnecessary characters and storylines stretches the film thin. Moving onto the two main characters of the film, Myers and Laurie's characters are thankfully preserved by the writers. Laurie's character was a bit overdone and silly, but it was still a smart twist to turn her into a gun-slinging, tough-as-nails badass. Michael, on the other hand, is still the same shape of evil as he was in the original and I appreciated the writers not trying to shoehorn him into some kind of mystical creature or have him say any lines. He certainly kills a lot more in the movie and has a bit more of a spring to his step, but he still (mostly) has the same slow, menacing movements that fans have been accustomed to over the years. For slasher enthusiasts, the kills deliver as they are very violent and are significantly more brutal than the original Halloween. There are several scenes that are suspenseful and edge-of-your-seat while there's other scenes that are simply predictable and uneventful. As a horror movie itself, it will evoke some scares out of casual fans but fans of the genre should not expect anything out of the ordinary. \n\nJohn Carpenter's soundtrack is phenomenal and it really helps the movie establish tension and fear while also evoking nostalgia and appreciation for the original movie. \n\nThere were several scenes that replicated scenes from the original that were fun, nostalgic callbacks.\n\nOverall, Halloween is certainly worth a watch for horror fans. It's by no means as good as the original due to some sloppy writing, but it's still a fun time that delivers with gore and suspense.",

Instead we got so many subplots and too many characters that we dont care about. Too much screentime is given to people that die off screen as well. Very safe. What makes it worse is Mcbride's rather cringy writing. Why are they trying to make us laugh whilst watching Halloween? Seriously. These people dont understand the original at all. But listening to carptenter himself saying how Gordon made it his own movie, its now painfully clear that Carpenter had very little to do here. Other than to probably give a few tips on Michaels appearance, behavior and music. The funny thing here however is that they wanted to forget the past and start fresh. And the way they did that... was to copy the ever living hell out of the original film INCLUDING Rob Zombie's remake. Michael is so violent and brutal in using physical force to smash people against stuff. And its just... not at all like Michael was in the past. He was a quick killer, silent and effecient. Not a brawler. \n\nZombie didn't get that. Gordon doesn't either. On top of that we got an almost full female cast by the end of the movie which makes sense since it was always the women Michael was hunting primarily. Problem is we dont give a damn about 2 of them. Only Laurie. The daughter was busy running around the whole movie and screaming in the forest. And Judy Greer was busy being a sceptic till the last 20 minutes of the film. Coming across as tedious and annoying. GREAT writing...  \n\nBut what kills is for me is the ending. How we see the three girls in the van, driving away after presumably leaving michael to burn ( which doesn't kill him as Halloween 2 proved nor will it here because we dont even see him die...) No. We get a god damn Halloween 4 RIP-OFF... when we see the daughter holding a kitchen knife in the van. Before fading to black. \n\nWhat...do you honestly think that means? IF you've seen Halloween 4. Come on. Its so god damn low energy, Gordon. You ripped off everything you could from existing material and called it a new chapter. Its one of the biggest copy-and paste pieces of cinematography I've ever seen. Even outdoing Star Wars The Force Awakens... and that freaking says something.  2 out of 5 stars. Below average, low effort, low energy safe reboot. Has comedic elements which dont belong, Danny Mcbride writing which CERTAINLY doesn't belong in a horror movie... jesus christ, and after Michael kills the journalists, the film becomes a boring, predictable chore. \n\nPeople are letting their blind nostalgia control their senses. Go watch the original and even halloween 2, then watch this again and you'll see just how crap it actually is. Its overhyped. And doesn't deliver at all. Its opening is strong but once Michael escapes and we spend so much bloody time with Laurie's dysfucntional as hell family thats living a dream world which is utterly ridiculous considering this universe, and cliche... once this crap transpires the film just turns to absolutely contrived drivel. I was just waiting for it to end. More I saw, lower the score got. \n\nGordon, you're a god damn hack.",

But saying that it is trash, is also completely wrong. It's a fun movie, there were some dumb jump scares and dumb character actions but there was much less of that here, even in Halloween 1, does anyone remember how Laurie literally drops her knife and doesn't do anything but cry 3 feet away from Michael, turning her back to him like an idiot. It happened in Halloween 1, and it'll happen here. Doesn't ruin the movie either.\n\nSome people hated the beginning build up, which makes no sense because it just hypes it up more for when Michael gets out and you truly get a sense for how evil he is, you get Loomis tapes etc. \n\nAnd some people hated the out of place comedy and the Doctor scene for example, the comedy is weird at times but it was there as a call back to the ridiculously goofy cops in Halloween 5, everything that seems weird is actually an Easter egg that people who probably only saw the first movie (I don't blame them either) won't understand. Furthermore, the crazy Doctor twist, follows one of the themes of the movie, \"Dont mess around with evil\", He tried to study it for so long that he really wanted to understand what Michael felt, why he did what he did, and so he tried it himself, he was corrupted by it. Don't Rudy evil, destroy it. Yes, maybe it was presented poorly, but again with some thinking and such, it isn't horrendous of an idea and it certainly doesn't break the movie at all.\n\nAlso, some people say Michael was supposed to be human and taken seriously but here he is surviving attacks like Freddy Krueger, First off, no he does not survive anything absolutely ridiculous, he is far more human here, and since when was he just some human in a mask, does anybody again remember in the first one, when he gets shot 6 TIMES! Falls off a balcony. AND IS STILL ALIVE! It's like these people never watched the first movie. He survives more ridiculous stuff in the first movie, he's the most human here I would even say.\n\nThis movie is a Halloween movie, it's certainly better than all the other sequels I would say, while not as creepy and Offering the Shape stalking like in the first Halloween as much as say killing people, the jolts, music, tenseness, are all well done and worth watching. \n\nLike what did some people expect too, Some Shakespearean quotes being thrown around.

This one, although co-produced by the original's director, John Carpenter, seemed mainly about gratuitous, standard-issue blood, gore and violence, and very little suspense. Hence, though it is billed as a reboot of the franchise, it seemed little more than just another tired sequel. A wasted opportunity for producers Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis. Maybe Debra Hill's influence would have helped? And yet, there was applause from the audience when the movie ended. Memorable scenes: The prison yard scene seemed promising regarding the mystery and suspense the rest of the movie might deliver. Silliest scene: Laurie Stroud leaping from her car waving her gun and crazily screaming at the unsuspecting trick-or-treaters to run for cover. From what, herself? Cultural relic: Lots of trick-or-treaters roaming around. Such busy streets would have been an accurate depiction of Halloween on the night of Michael's first, youthful murder in 1963, but not during his slice-and-dice-and-braincase-abuse spree as a 65-year old in 2018.",

It must've been a product of its time, and that's what people are blind sided by.\n\nAnyways, I left the theater feeling I got every cent worth of my money.  Jamie Lee Curtis carried the movie.  You really felt for her character unlike any other slashers minus Scream.  The homages to the previous films gave me Nostalgia galore.  \n\nComplaints:  The supporting character's acting was mediocre.  Especially the chunky kid the blonde babysitter was watching.  He tried to make a joke when Myers attacked and it wasn't funny or cute.  It took away from the moment.  The male British reporter wasn't convincing either.  He was suppose to lose his marbles when yelling at Michael and it just felt tamed.  Didn't create the insanity that the filmmakers intended.  \n\nStory:  They should have made this a sequel to Halloween 2.  The original Halloween 2 felt like a continuation of the original.  It makes no sense why Myers would go after Curtis if she wasn't his sister.  If he was just attacking random people why go after her, because she's the one who got away.  Meh...  \n\nOverall, I'll still buy it when it comes out on DVD.",

The thing I love about the final girl scene is that it is an average girl, put into extraordinary situation, and through her wit and ability to adapt, she becomes a survivor. this movie obviously wanted to tell the story of what happens to a person after such a traumatic event happens in their life. but her making a bunker, and (spoiler) essentially waiting for Michael to arrive at her house with booby traps and stuff really took away from that average girl overcoming the odds and surviving the mass killing. \n\nThe kills were creative, I like that there is no rhyme or reason to why Michael myers kills (family, a satanic cult, etc.), he's just pure evil. too many Halloween easter eggs. \n\noverall, it was solid, but not spectacular. I was not blown away, nor did I felt scared or saw something different. I wouldn't say it was a waste of money, I just maybe need to lower my expectations in horror films.",

I'm baffled by the fact this was produced by Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter. WHAT??!! Did they just need a paycheck? Because that's what this film felt like. This film felt like not just an insult to the franchise, but an insult to the genre as a whole. I still can't tell you who the main character was... maybe Jamie Lee Curtis? Maybe Judy Greer (why was she even in this film)? Maybe the granddaughter? The script was like they took three different scripts and a whole bunch of catch phrases and just threw them into a blender. I'm mostly upset with the other horror buffs in my news feed who have posted about seeing this film not once, not twice, but three times. I'm seriously baffled by the fact you think this is quality film making. I've taken film classes with some of you. This goes against everything we were taught and is an insult to our degrees.

This is all in anticipation of septuagenerian, shuffling Michael Myers unleashing armageddon on the world, or at least within the small town that she, her estranged daughter and family all still reside.\nWith that set-up the film has to entirely rely upon the classic horror film promise that despite all the warnings and preperations yo the contrary, no one makes a single rational decision regarding their safety -- including her adult daughter (aka, John Conner) who periodically laments her crazy mother's paranoid parenting style  that mostly relied on shotguns, rifles and revolvers.\nWith the possible exception of the best friend/babysitter/victim #7, the characters are all caricatures. Add far too much cringe-worthy teenage sexual innuendo, improv acting, and you find yourself wishing a bloodsoaked Carrie would appear at the high school gymnasium Halloween party and be done with it. \nInstead we trudge through countless unscary scenes  following a jilted girlfriend escorted home by her creepy gender unspecific boyfriend's creepier, uncomic relief, best buddy as the trys to comfort/seduce her along the way.  So It's a welcome relief when Michael (finally:and rather unceremoniously) wanders into frame, raises his hand and slashes him -- unfortunately not fatally. So we're treated to a few more moments of unfunny improvised oneway dialogue from the creepy friend before we discover Michael eventually mercifully impaled him by the  mouth on the neighbor's conveniently gothic iron front gate.  In short the best scenes are the aftermath of the unseen murders when we get to see the outstanding make-up departments handywork.\nThere isn't an untelegraphed scary moment in this latest sub-par installment of a franchise that should be spinning in it's own grave.",

I know from that opening sequence that they'd done what they said they weren't going to.

They also made an unforgivable mistake with the marketing - put out so much footage, including the death of a major character in the final act, that I had seen most of the plot. There was virtually nothing that was a surprise because of it. And worst of all they allowed the finale to be described in the iTunes track listing sp I knew what happened weeks before I saw it. Its been a hit because of fans like me and dumb teens who dont know what they are watching but I consider this an insult to those of us who have stuck by it. They should have spent a year getting the script into a far better shape. This was such a disappointment.",

The body count is high with a few (very few) kill effects and at the very least the suspense level is high without being over burdening.  I was lucky enough to see the original opening weekend in 1978 and was gratified to watch the audience reactions to what was on the screen.  This one was simply another sequel with no surprises.  I still give it a high rating and applaud Mr. Carpenter and Miss Curtis for perhaps putting an end to the series.  Let's see something new for a change.",

That film was eerie, it had atmosphere, it was patient, it had purpose.  Despite somehow fooling critics into giving this film mostly positive reviews, I was honestly more impressed with the sloppy 1981 Halloween II.  That movie was also guilty of replacing atmosphere with brainless violence.  But it did at least attempt to continue the story and feel of the first movie.  I am not defending Halloween II, it's not a good movie.  But, it is a better sequel than this movie is.  Exceedingly violent, it even turns Michael into a very creative sadist, pulling out people's teeth and turning them into human jack'o lanterns.  This Michael Myers HAS had 40 years to brood and become more inventive.  But part of what made him so creepy in 1978 and 1981 was, he wasn't elaborate in his pathology.  He simply killed people without remorse or hesitation.  He did, however, seem to have a reason or some sense of purpose, especially in the first movie.  Here, he kills anyone and everyone and is prolific - this is high-volume, high-violence, more is better because we are all so desensitized we need smushed heads and graphic deaths every 3 minutes.  Even the reimagined Lori Strode and her 3 generations of survivor women isn't fully or effectively realized.  It could have been.  The opportunity was here, yet again, and I have the feeling this is the last chance for Lori and Michael to square off on October 31.  It's pretty sad, actually.

Although the movie was never the less a wonderful sequel to the first, the movie had a few down points, for example parts of the movie relied on comic relief instead of suspense, such as the child that was being babysat who seemed to be just used to get a small few laughs from the audience in a scene , which if didn't had the child , would be a almost perfect scene. Another example is Michael's new doctor who instead of being a replacement of the late Donald Pleasance, was what seemed to be an obsessive \"fan\" who instead of wanting to contain the evil of Michael wanted to essentially wanted him to \"Say something\". Other than useless scenes and pointless tone drops the movie was a excellent story that the original directors (who mostly directed this addition) would be proud of, using familiar camera tricks, recreating the movies opening from the original, and using the outer focus to hide Michael from the audience. All together a amazingly enjoyable movie.",

Unfortunately, it doesn't work well too often in horror films because it lightens the mood/atmosphere. A horror film should smother you in it's dark subject matter. The last point is that while some kills were impressive, it is unnecessarily gory. The first Halloween and even the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre were not gory at all, but they were genuinely frightening because what they didn't show was left to the viewer's imagination making it even more disturbing. \nIt's good to see Michael back and Jamie Lee is great, but to me, the true sequel to Halloween will always be Halloween 2.

Michael Myers, who was terrifying three decades ago, is now, once again, terrifying. The movie starts with these two terrible reporters confronting Michael at his insane asylum. They pull out his murder mask, and all the other psychotic inmates have panic attacks at the sight if the mask. This scene alone sets up the tone of the movie. This shows that these already insane, psychotic people are terrified of this man, and because of that it's pretty terrifying to see them screaming and flipping shit. Of course, Michael escapes and murders quite a few people, and of course this sets Laurice off and she starts to freak out and try to protect her grandchild and her daughter. Seeing Laurice on edge throughout this entire movie is actually a very good thing to show, because in every other movie she's in, she has always been the person who was been strong and willing to fight. Anyway, blah blah blah, let's get to the meat and potatoes of the movie: Michael fucking Myers. Michael has jumpscares, I'm not going to say that he doesn't, but the majority of this movie is him being in the background, barely noticeable, and he starts to slowly move forward and closer to the victim. It's genuinely terrifying. Sometimes you can see his shadow and then he comes out of nowhere and stabs someone in the fucking neck. Laurice fighting Micahel in the final act was also set up so perfectly, I was in awe in the theaters. The cinematography accompanied by the soundtrack is the best I've seen in a while as well, and finally, I am going to go bakc to the earlier parts of the movie. When Michael finds the reporters, I was genuinely scared. The last horror movie that actually truly petrified me was IT (1990) and I was 6 when I originally saw it!\n\nYes, I have talked about the strengths of this movie, but there ate a few things that had gotten on my nerves to be completely honest. The first thing that annoyed me isn't exactly a big deal, but I really would've liked to have seen Michael wrecking the bus and escaping. Of course, this doesn't make the movie worse, but it's just me being nit-picky. Also, the characters are very, very, very stupid. Like literally retarded at some parts.",

This is not only a thematic mirror but even a concrete visual one. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis is just amazing) is the perfect echo of Michael Myers. She's the stalker of the light. She takes the boogeyman's place several times, but with a completely opposite intention.\n\nThis is a tale of empowerment of the victim in the #MeToo era. And for the fragile masculinities that can be somehow be bothered by this, don't worry: Good Ol' Mike meets a fairly large bloody quota.\n\nMy sole criticism with \"Halloween\" is its little commitment bookending the story, eliminating the possibility of creating a perfect duology.

Those questions were never answered and I think that would have made the movie more interesting. A lot of his victims had nothing to do with the story. They were just random. At one point he don't kill his doctor then the next time he does. \nThey should have focused on why he kills and who, why he don't talk, and kept the story focused on Lori Strode and her daughters family and then tied all that together. \nI also didn't like that they basically remade scenes from the first movie but involved different characters doing the same thing. For example, in the first one Michael falls off the balcony and disappears shortly after. In this one Strode does. This happens several times throughout. I think the writers could have been more creative instead of copying something that has already been done.",

The thing that made Michael Myers such a good horror icon was there was no rhyme or reason to why he kills. He just did. The other sequels tried to explain why he was like this and the best answer for this franchise is he's just evil. This movie went with that theme and it makes this sequel so much more intense and thrilling. Laurie Strode becoming obsessed from her trauma made so much sense. And the little nods throughout the movie were great without making them too much of a device to make it entertaining. Probably the best horror movie to come out in the last couple of years.",

I don't think people that try to remake or sequel Halloween understand what made the original so great. \n\nThe original wasn't full of gore, the thing that made it scary was Michael Myers was mysterious and hidden through most of the film. You only saw brief glimpses of him but when he did appear on screen, it was startling and eerie. There was a genuine reason to fear him. \n\nNow filmmakers think showing him with extreme kill scenes with blood and gore make it a great horror movie. Doesn't work. Go back and make Myers mysterious and hidden and use him sparingly.  Too much of The Shape is not a good thing. \n\nI will say the movie started strong, but by the second half, it just kind of loses its way. There are plot lines that just make absolutely no sense. It's like \"hey, let's just throw this in here just to surprise people\" but it fails miserably. If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, you'll know it once you see it.",

Omitted every movie but the 1st one, down played Michael Meyers back story/history/legacy like he only had 5 kills on his record like it was just a random babysitter thing and he's been completely dormat for 40 yrs since. Then they took away the sibling backstory of him and Laurie which always gave the Halloween franchise it's depth/storyline. It seemed like his escape and finding laurie was simply opportunistic and not him actually obsessively and purposely hunting her down which is another thing that gave this franchise storyline/depth. It just lacked everything that made the Halloween franchise worthy of being a cult horror franchise for me. It also seemed strange for Laurie to spend 40 yrs prepping for him to come for her when they downplay it all like a random babysitter attack and no other kills since for that length of time. Without the sibling history, other escapes and kills it seemed out of place and again, like him escaping now and finding laurie and her family was purely opportunistic only, like he just stumbled upon them and it was all just coincidence. I think they had a great idea with showing laurie's ptsd, her survival instincts/final stand but it doesnt work when you take away all the substance that would make all that necessary. I had high hopes for this but now I'm just left frustrated.",

This movie might work better for you if you've never watched another Halloween sequel. Even then, the suspension of disbelief is way over the top. Michael would be something like 67 at this point and have spent his entire life in an institution. That's not someone who's going to be physically intimidating. And in the original film, if we ignore the sequels, Michael's not physically intimidating, really. He's a looming presence always in the background. He sneaks and slunks around. Imagine this film if it were about a quiet old man who escapes a mental institution slyly and goes back to kill the one who got away. Imagine if Laurie were a nice old lady who-when confronted with the evil of her childhood-finds that strength again to do anything to protect her granddaughter. What would that movie have been? One that was a lot more relatable and not just realistic but also human than this hunk of garbage Terminator sequel.",

In this sense, its terrifying to think what happens to people after such tragedy.

I found the teens annoying, and just a waste of screen time so Michael could get some more kills. When the final fight does come down however, it's very intense between Michael and Laurie. After the fight, the film gives a typical horror cash cow ending, so yeah there is definitely a sequel :( At the end of the day though, Halloween may suffer from it's annoying minor characters, but it excels in bringing closure to the 40 year story of Michael and Laurie Strode",

I honestly preferred Rob Zombies Halloween movie to this. It was slow to start and did not really set a mood or atmosphere for the film. I suggest putting on Halloween III at home.",

            "content": "It's been 40 years since Michael Myers stalked Laurie Strode in Haddonfield, Illinois. Since then we have been subject to a slew of sequels, reboots and spinoffs, some of which Jaime Lee Curtis has starred in herself. Now comes Halloween 2018, 20 years after Halloween H2O and 40 years since the original film. This film stands as the TRUE sequel to the first film exploring what has happened to Strode and her family since the traumatic event. In what can only be described as a modern horor classic with tropes that evolve into truly terrifying and tense scenes with outstanding performances from the female cast and a modern twist on this classic tale that will have Halloween fans screaming for more.\n\nHalloween is set in the current time with Laurie Strode (Jaime Lee Curtis) a complete shadow of the woman she was when we met her in the first film. She is battered, angry and essentially broken. She lives on the outskirts of town in her own fortress, completely obsessed with Michael Myers and his impending transfer to another prison. Her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) is hepling her own daughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) get ready to leave for college. Enter two British podcasters who want to interview Myers and Strode to gain new insight into these crimes (think Making a Murderer etc) who provoke Myers and unleash all hell on this unsuspecting community who are forced to relive these events from 40 years ago.\n\n\n\nGoing into this movie it was hard not to buy into the hype. The press junkets from Curtis have been captivating, audiences and critics are raving about the film, yet after the last few years of disappointing horror films it was hard to come into this with fresh eyes and still regain some shred of hope for this sequel (particularly after Laurie Stode's infamous death scene in Halloween Resurrection). What I loved most about this film is its constant nods to the sequels as well as other horror hits like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Having millenials point out the absurdity of people being so hung up on 5 deaths that happened 40 years ago compared to the horrors that our world faces today is something worth exploring. While they directly addressed it, it wasn't really explored any further than that. That being said the intensity of the murders and brutality of the death scenes are nothing short of spectacular. You can really feel the Blumhouse influence in the gore and confronting slasher scenes.\n\nWhile this is all set in modern times, the score, soundtrack, camera shots and feel fresh out of the 1970's original. This is the perfect blend of modern and classic horror that make the film feel epic an very true to the series past. Curtis looks the part as a grandmother who is prepared to protect her family at any cost. Her haggard and rough portrayal perfectly match the home or really fortress in which she lives. Simiarly Karen has suffered a life of neglect and trauma due to her mother's paranoia and has a firm stance on not budging till Laurie gets professional help. This is then passed down to Allyson who is definitely the most sand of the three characters living a relatively carefree teenage life with clear sympathy and affection for her grandma, while her relationship with her mother is extremely strained. In the final act of the film where all three women come together to confront Michael Myers. It really cements their relationship and shows the generational trauma that this movie sets about to explain.\n\n\n\nThis film does have alot of intense and emotional moments, it was really hard to put nostalgia and all the love I have for the originalk film aside and treat this as its own thing. Sometimes the film goes out of its way to explain things that could have just been portrayed through actions and flashbacks rather than having a spoken narrative over the top. This is one part of the film that I didn't enjoy. Audiences are unfortunately treated like idiots at times and while this may be necessary for audiences who haven't seen the first film, it really takes you out of the film.\n\nOverall Halloween 2018 is a true return to form after 20 years of sequels that pale in comparison to the original. While this doesn't quite reach the heights of the first film, it does get really REALLY close. Be prepared for some really intense moments and performances that are rare in a horror film (especially from Blumhouse!) Definitely don't see this alone, take your friends, your family and prepare for the return of Halloween and what is sure to be impending sequels for years to come. For the meantime enjoy this masterpiece in filmmaking and storytelling.\n\n\n\nHalloween is in cinemas this Thursday.\n\nReview by Alaisdair \"Leithal\" Leith.",

Notable characters that you can remember by name for most part. I counted 16 deaths total in a hour and 40 mins, about a kill on average of 8.75 mins. Halloween fans will enjoy this new take. The theme is women facing their fears and overcoming their monsters that haunt their past. Jamie Lee Curtis performance was excellent, no cash grab role. The supporting cast and the shapes victims were also memorable. This is the perfect movie with Halloween just around the corner.

Seriously, this is a titanic step up from all the other ones, except maybe the original. Michael Myers feels like an actual threat again, and not some stupid cheesy slasher. Despite not saying a single word throughout the entire movie, he feels like a person. All the while, though, there were just some kills that were so unbelievably cheesy that it takes you right out of the movie, and this is especially hurtful to the movie because he original was so subtle with its kills. For the most part, though, it feel realistic enough to be somewhat possible, something important in horror. \n\nAs to be expected in a modern horror, there is a hefty helping of fake-out scares. While not being so obnoxious that they make you want to vomit, (cough cough Conjuring series cough cough) they're still kinda irritating. But to compensate for the fake-outs, there's an awesome long take that follows Micheal as he resumes his killing spree in Haddonfield, and it feels just like the opening of the original. It really did put a smile on my face. Speaking of \"just like he original,\" it's easy to tell that there was a lot of care put into making this one feel like the original, even down to the opening credits with the jack-o-lantern. \n\nThe acting is a mixed bag. In the first act, the acting for Laurie's daughter is super wooden, and there are some other performances that don't quite feel real. However, Jamie Lee Curtis is amazing, and she feels like someone who was traumatized, and is desperately trying to cope with the horrors of her past. \n\nIn short, Halloween is a love letter to the original, with some Blumhouse campiness included. It's giod, for certain, but just a few steps short from great.",

This movie is a great throw back to the original. The Heroine Lorie Strode is the bad-ass character we all saw in the trailers, and I pray that it stays that way.

I scare easy and I hate getting scared in a theater full of people  who will probably laugh at my uncontrollable shrieking. However, my neuroses aside, I went to see the new Halloween film last night with a date who was proud to be a HUGE horror movie nerd. \n\nThis film is made to be a direct sequel to the original 1978 film. we are made to believe that after Michael disappeared after falling out of a second foot window, he was arrested and sent to an insane asylum for the next 40 years. During that time the shrinks still couldn't crack what's inside the man's head so they gave up and get ready to ship him off to the local prison to spend the rest of his days.  But not before a couple of annoying European podcasters  seem to reawaken Michael's bloodlust during an interview in the rec yard (A creepy scene, especially in broad daylight).\n\nOn the outside world, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has spent the past 40 years training for a future showdown with the serial killer, ruining her relationship with her daughter in the process but also fostering a good relationship with her grand daughter. \n\nSure enough, the bus transferring Michael to prison gets into an accident and he's free to wreck havoc, releasing a second act full of clever and gruesome murder. \n\nI enjoyed the film. there were cheap jump scares and the classic horror tropes that made the original Halloween a classic. This film adds nothing new to the lore but happily strips all of the lore that has attached itself to the franchise in the past 40 years. This kind of bare bones horror slasher movie works better because there are fewer rules to follow. With that being said, I have no idea why Michael wants to kill Laurie or her family so bad. \n\nI'm sure someone will write about the theme of multi-generational  feminism that runs through the film (that would be an interesting essay). Someone else may also write about the racial stereotypes of white people in horror films  (which this film almost makes a statement about). The film is also heavy handed when it comes to the nostalgia factor of the film (John Carpenter's revisiting of his original score is amazing). But this film works best if you come to the theater looking to get a fright and see some bloody killings. \n\nMy date, the hardcore horror nerd, was covering her eyes and grabbing my arm throughout the movie. So that must be a good sign.",

The soundtrack was definitely a John Carpenter soundtrack. There were so many parallel scenes to the original movie. It really did the original justice. The acting was great by the main three girls as well. However, the comedy in this was terrible and useless. The original had such an eerie vibe, even in the down scenes of the original there was always some creepy background music playing and it really paced itself and made the whole experience more scary and have the fear stick longer. This one, whenever there wasn't a scary scene (and even during some scary scenes) that had to add these useless one liners. It was ridiculous and not everyone likes the toxic comedy genre to take over their genre. Stupid one liners have ruined so many modern movies for me, and this one isn't an exception. It appeals to the lowest common denominator of people, but I guess those are the ones giving movies the most money. While Jamie Lee Curtis killed her role, it was pointless to have her so obsessed with Michael after one night, 40 years ago. At least when he was her brother it made sense that she always felt the connection to him in H20. And even in H20 she wasn't as obsessed. It really didn't make sense. There were also a lot of cliche's in this movie. The pace was also just too fast. The original Halloween offered a stalking pace, Michael really followed and scared his prey. Here, he just killed whoever was around. I really wanted to love this movie, I was so excited. I still think it was good, but it was mainly the pointless comedy that ruined it for me. I hope the one liner fad starts to die off, but as long as people continue to stupidly fall for it, it'll be here for awhile.",

The movie doesn't try to be anything it's not and isn't afraid of dragging out the suspense whilst Myers stalks and eventually kills his victims. \n\nFurthermore you feel deeply for Laurie and she is as fully fledged out a  character as the horror genre allows for. By the end of the film you actually care for her and pray she doesn't get ambushed as she shakily searches for Michael in her home during the final act. \n\nIf I had one complain to make, it would be that the ending scene was too abrupt & I would've liked to have seen a better ending.",

This lean, mean and brutal version is much closer to the speed of Rob Zombie's then that of the slow-burning, stalking Shape. If you prefer to see established characters that you care about become utilized as Michael's focus, and a slow-burning suspense similar to the original, you won't find that here.

Not overly gratuitous in its violence this film feels accessible to those not looking for over the top gruesomeness but instead doubles down with increased tension, anticipation, and rawness of its kills. Jaime Lee Curtis plays her part perfectly, as a strong willed heroine, devoted to protecting her family, and hardened by the traumatizing experiences of her past. Although the movie was enjoyable, it was also balanced in its disappointment. Despite the film being rated R, the kills were mostly bland, usually taking place off screen while others simply tail ending carefully constructed tension and anticipation with a lackluster stab or neck snap. I feel that the movie's R rating was wasted and completely unnecessary and with very few modifications could have been a more widely accessible PG-13. Several of the characters, including Jamie Lee Curtis' character make clumsy usually disastrous decisions that go completely against character arc and development with some very confusingly nonsensical and out of no where twists. It is a sad fact to say that the only creativity of the kills didn't come from the kills themselves, instead from the display of the bodies afterwords which sums up the film as a whole, it's a mostly bland movie, with some very creative concepts; but a lot wasted opportunities and potential.",

This film wasn't very dark and a lot of the scenes seemed forced. I would have liked to had seen alot more of a modern environment and to see Laurie strode doing well. But instead we get a old shack and literally ideas  rehashed from the first two films. I know why the excluded halloween 2 because they would have had to explain how he was shot in the eyes and burned to death . Which part 4 stupidly picked up from there explaining that he still had a body to save and for whatever reason they wanted to save him? But in my opinion it still never should have tried to compete with the second one in no form or fashion. There was one scene they wrote in where the doctor did something really stupid . I was just in AWW.  I really think at this point this should be the end of the series . This wasn't bad but it brought nothing fresh . At least Rob Zombies version brought something fresh . Any one that wants to watch a well made sequel with mystery and suspense and some weird kills watch Halloween 2 the original . Its a really interesting film and it shows that nothing could every be replicated . Its a quirky creepy and very dark interesting watch especially the fact he is stocking her in the hospital the entire time.",

There were so many unnecessary scenes, poor acting at times, and it was a serious struggle to keep my eyes open. There are so many reviews stating how this movie was so BRUTAL....truthfully they must not watch many horror type movies then because the only way I could use \"brutal\" when describing this movie is to say it was BRUTALLY AWFUL! On an upside, Jamie Lee Curtis did a fantastic job acting but the plot made her fall short. I agree that Michael doesn't need a backstory but I feel like having him and her be brother and sister gave the movies that extra scare factor. Since they took that part out of this movie, it made it seem dull. The kills are mediocre at best. It drags on so much that you feel like the movie is 3 hours long. The ending was rushed and lacked any type of thrill.

There are a few plot holes that never get filled, so that's a strike against this movie, but I think most movies have similar issues if examined closely enough. Some of the other problems people have, such as the humor, completely depends on your opinion. Personally I liked the humor for the most part - it made the movie feel more realistic. It's not the goriest Halloween, and I appreciate that, but I feel it's the sequel that shows the most respect to Micheal Myers. There's no unnecessary backstory for him, no weird supernatural stuff, just Micheal lumbering around and killing people for no reason, which is what Micheal does.  The characters aren't all super fleshed out, but they are mostly likeable. The plot isn't great, but it's enough to get Micheal out and about again, which is really what you're watching this movie for in the first place anyways. Jamie Lee Curtis was great in my opinion as Laurie Strode. The best thing this movie could have done is exactly what it did, and that's ignore all of the other Halloween films except for the first one. It makes sense and isn't crazy and convoluted like some of the sequels. \n\nMy biggest issue with the movie is probably a common one, and that's with a certain plot twist about halfway through the movie that really comes out of nowhere and doesn't make a lot of sense. This movie would have been phenomenal if they had left that out entirely, but it's in there, and the movie overall is worse off for it in my opinion. Word on the street is that there's a Director's cut of this movie that will be released, and I can only hope that they pull that twist out. \n\nThe ending was underwhelming in my opinion, but not for lack of trying. They certainly wanted the movie to end with a bang, which it did, but not a kind of impactful bang. Overall I liked the movie - it's my favorite Halloween sequel by a long shot, mostly just because I don't have to think about all of the weird crap from the other ones. I think casual fans of the series such as myself will enjoy it, and I recommend buying a ticket to watch it in theaters. Watching Micheal Myers return to killing after 40 patient years is fun, even with the flaws.",

The first 45 mins of the film they could have left out. It was boring and had no reason to be in the film. \n\nHow do you have famous Michael Myers actors come back like Nick Castle and screw up such an easy role to play.\n\nWhen Michael was on his killing spree in the original Halloween, he was slow moving and had no expression at all. Today when he is in 40s or 50s, he seems to move so fast with lots of quick expressions. Wouldn't you slow down as you got older? It seems we have it backwards here.\n\nJaime Lee Curtis's role was so bad and dull. A woman that has made a 30 year lifestyle of making a house that could withstand a war. She has 5 locks on her front door and also has a drop bar. It would take a tank to knock this down. However, she is so stupid to have a front door with glass windows in it that all you have to do is break the glass and unlock everything? Also for a woman who has spent her life preparing for battle with EVIL, she has guns that are so outdated, I think she bought them in the 1800's. I mean they are guns like revolvers and carvery rifles that every shot you take you have to cock the gun handle again. There is even a scene in the movie where she is given 3 thousand dollars to do an interview about Michael. Why didn't she take that money and buy a real rifle that was made in this century.\n\nYes this movie made 77 million dollars opening weekend, but who the hell saw it? I went to a 3:45 showing on Saturday the 20th in a busy city, and there was no more then 10 people in the theater including me and my guest. \n\nThis is truly a film that made this look like the best Halloween movie ever in the previews, but when it comes down to it, its a horrible horror film by any of today standards. Forget horror film, its a BAD film by any standards period. Will not be buying this movie on 4k when it comes out. \n\nOut of all the halloween movies, this has to be the bottom of the list. YES I know that's hard to say, but honestly it wasnt a movie. It SUCKED!",

The ending was the best part of the movie but this piece shows a lack of ability to truly scare your audience. Basically Michael is a wordless killer.  He gets loose & kills a bunch of people. I've never seen a movie in this franchise & I knew that.

The plot contains everything a slasher fan wants in the first 2/3 of the movie but I can say it was the last 1/3 that defined greatness to me.  The Shape was downright brutal and carved up his victims like a Thanksgiving turkey showing no remorse.  The best acting goes for the bravery exhibited by Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) who after 40 years is able to be the strong heroine in the slasher genre and confront the evil without fear.  \n\nFor those who are on the ropes about watching this you have no worries.

            "content": "Halloween 2018 is a triumphant return to form for the Halloween franchise, and a signal for a new era of horror reboots, one that hopefully brings more to the table than the Michael Bay driven era of remakes from the early 2000s. Jamie Lee Curtis once again returns to her most iconic role of Laurie Strode, horror's ultimate final girl, for one last battle against her nemesis Michael Myers. Joining in on the fight is a whole family of Strodes, including Karen Strode played by Judy Greer, and newcomer Andi Matichak playing Allyson Strode. The three generations of Strode women band together in a fiery climax to rid Haddonfield of it's dreaded boogeyman once and for all. \n\nBehind the scenes we have franchise creator John Carpenter returning after a long hiatus away from the series, this time as an executive producer and of course, also composing a new and soon to be iconic score. Malek Akkad, son of series grandfather Moustapha Akkad, now leads the series, and franchise newcomers David Gordon Green and Danny McBride join the series as director and screenwriter respectively, along with Jeff Fadley. Jason Blum also produces as apart of his studio Blumhouse, which is currently dominating the horror genre alongside Warner Bros, and we couldn't be happier about that. Horror has undergone a renaissance in the last few years. So many quality horror films and reboot are being made, and there is so much money being brought into the box office. We are all so lucky as movie and horror fans to be living in this era. I'm excited what we're gonna see next, in terms of both the Halloween franchise and horror in general. \n\nAs always, I'll start with what I did like first.\n\nThe acting and performances were all top notch. Jamie Lee Curtis brings her all to this role. When she passes away, it'll be this role and her work in horror that she'll be most remembered for I believe, and with performances like this, it's not hard to see why. There's a sincere grief and trauma that haunts Laurie all throughout the film. I could see the fear and pain in her eyes from everything she suffered all those years ago, and her interactions with her family were the most heartfelt and sincere moments I've ever seen in this series. Curtis also shines on the opposite side of that spectrum and kicks plenty of ass in the film as well. Her compound was full of Home Alone style booby traps and there were many moments of the film were Laurie mimicked Michael from the original Halloween, which I thought was insanely clever and the best kind of referencing and fan service. The other members of the cast were also all good. I especially liked Judy Greer as Laurie's long suffering daughter Karen. She had a lot of surprising moments, and her backstory felt natural and real. She also had probably the most badass moment of the film, when she pretends to be scared and cries out for her mom, and when Michael takes the bait and appears in front of her, she quickly snaps back and shoots him straight to the ground. Bad-fucking-ass. That's exactly the kind of character development I want to see in my slasher films. Andi Matichak was good as well. I thought a lot of the scenes of her and her friends were nice updated versions of the scenes with Laurie and her friends from the original film. Some of her friends were a little obnoxious and I could have done without them, but overall her character and interactions with her family and friends were a nice diversion away from the dark and brutal killings. I think the best teen characters were definitely Miles Robbins and Virginia Gardner. Gardner especially had a really good scene when she was babysitting, and the back and forth between her and the child she was watching was nice and sweet, as well as hilarious as hell. The entire theatre was cracking up during these scenes. Nick Castle and James Courtney share the role of Michael Myers, and it was refreshing to see to original Shape back in action. I felt the detachment, the evil, his pure menace as he stalked to streets of Haddonfield and racked up an impressive body count. As a whole, most of the characters were charming and likeable, something you can't say for many of the other Halloween sequels or slasher films in general. Many of the deaths were hard to watch because I genuinely didn't want the characters to die. GOOD SCREENWRITING! It's kinda important\n\nThe directing and cinematography were the best since the original film. David Gordon Green made this movie his own, and didn't just rehash the same scenes over and over again. He paid tribute to the entire series in a clever and respectful way, which was smart considering many fans were upset about the ignoring of all the sequels. Those long tracking shots and the many shots of Michael lurking in the background and behind people were the true essence of Halloween. I was skeptical of Green's ability to helm one of horror's most iconic characters, but he succeeded in spectacular fashion.\n\nI can't think of another horror series where the music is just as much a character as the actual characters in the movie, and the music here is simply superb, and it's even more incredible that it's provided by the man himself John Carpenter. Where do I even begin with Carpenter. He's the man. His filmography is so vast and he's created so many modern classics it's ridiculous. And he's scored almost all of his own films, with Halloween 2018 being the first film he's composed the music for that he didn't write or direct. The new themes, especially the one used for Allyson's chase scene. I liked the new variations of the classic score, and the ending credit theme is probably my favorite track of the score. \n\nThe choice to ignore all the previous sequels was the right one in my opinion. There are many fans out there that wished Halloween II had been included in the canon, but wiping the slate completely clean and just using the original film as a jumping off point makes so much sense. The continuity of the Halloween franchise is almost singularly unique amongst horror series. There are so many timelines and resets that trying to find a way to make a true sequel to this series is near impossible. So it makes sense to just go back to the original 1978 film and build a story from there. It provides us with a much better version of the story Halloween H20 tried to tell, and wasn't entirely successful in doing. We get a psychologically damaged Laurie who has pushed everyone away from her, two generations of Strodes that have been touched by Michael Myers in different ways, and we get the best motivation for Michael to hunt Laurie; she's the \"one who got away\". That to me is miles better than having them be brother and sister. It makes Michael scary again, and his pursuit of Laurie more interesting. The way the film narratively and cinematically links the film to the 1978 Halloween is so much more effective than the dozens of homages the series has paid to the original film, and makes for a more seamless transition between the two films. There were so many moments that mirrored or referenced the original, but in a unique way that I loved. It completely subverted my expectations time and time again, and it's been so long since a Halloween movie, or any horror movie, has done that. \n\nThis Halloween is relentless and brutal in the best way possible. Michael Myers truly is The Shape again, and the embodiment of pure evil that John Carpenter and Debra Hill intended him to be all those years ago. That long tracking shot of Michael going from house to house and randomly murdering people was the perfect image of what Michael Myers is supposed to be. Pure, unfiltered rage and evil. And I also respect horror movies that have the courage to place small children in mortal danger. The Halloween series has a history of this, and it's nice to see it return once again. \n\nThis was the first Halloween film since Halloween 6 that had a Halloween atmosphere. Some people already disagree with me, but the choice to film in the winter was a great choice, and the background and fall decorations all gave the film a nice crisp autumn vibe. \n\nI liked that the original credits and fonts from the first movie were used. It was another bit of connective tissue that connected it with the original Halloween. Being such a young fan, I haven't seen a quality Halloween film in theatres, and seeing the font and iconic titles on screen felt like watching the original film back in 1978\n\nThings I didn't like\n\nThe opening credits rubbed me the wrong for some reason. I didn't like the inflating pumpkin, even though I get the concept behind it. It looked to fake in my opinion, and the titles went by too fast. \n\nSome of the humor was misplaced, and deflated some of the tension of the movie. The babysitter murder scene was a prime example, as the young child who was being babysat was making jokes during his babysitter's actual murder and it did not gel with the rest of the scene. Some of the other scenes with Allyson's friends were a tab bit off putting, and I would have preferred more scenes with the Strodes.\n\nThe podcasters didn't really add anything new or that interesting to the film. The two actors did a great job, and their opening scene was nice, with them meeting Michael at Smith's Grove, but their storyline never really panned out the way I wanted. I was expecting them to provide a commentary on how culture's fascination with serial killers, and while there was some of that in flashes, especially the cemetary scene, there wasn't enough to justify their inclusion in the film, and they ultimately only serve as a means for Michael to get his mask back. I wish they had more meaningful scenes before being violently murdered.\n\nThis is not a slight on the movie itself, but more of the series as a whole. Because Halloween has hit the reset button so many times, there's a sense familiarity to the proceedings. This isn't the first time Laurie and Michael have faced off against each so many years after the original, and the film loses some of its impact because of that. Several scenes also felt too similar to the other films, and so the film didn't feel as fresh as it could have been. Once again, nothing against the movie itself, but it being the 11th film in the series weakens some of its bite.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nPerhaps no movie or sequel in the Halloween franchise will ever come close to topping John Carpenter's immortal classic, but Halloween 2018 comes mighty close. The story, performances, direction, and atmosphere are supremely ahead of anything this franchise has attempted before. I was blown away by the commitment by everyone involved with this project, and the film met my very low expectations and then some. It's far from a perfect movie, but very few movies are. The original Halloween itself wasn't an immediate classic,  and I believe with time, this one may be seen as being worthy of that 1978 film by all audiences. The filmmakers held such a deep reverence for the Halloween franchise, and respected it and its fans, and that's why the film works on so many levels. I haven't seen a horror sequel/reboot made with this much respect and effort in quite some time, and the levels of success an box office the film is already achieving warms my heart. I hope this is a signal to a new wave of quality horror reboots. After the last wave left such a bad taste in the mouths of so many fans and movie goers, it's time our favorite slasher/horror icons get a second chance to reinvent themselves. And we should all be so lucky if they come halfway to matching David Gordon Green's Halloween.",

I did enjoy some of the nods and homages to Halloween 1-3 it felt a bit too much at times and like I was being pandered to as a hardcore Halloween fan. But this was a pretty solid installment overall. Great cinematography and Halloween atmosphere. Michael has never been more manachail. Good jump scares. Gory but not over the top gory. Solid acting from the entire cast.I think most hardcore Halloween fans will like this one. I would rank it 4th overall in the series. Just behind the original ,Halloween 2 and 4",

            "content": "When the trailer for Halloween 2018 played before our eyes, we felt excited that Michael Myers was going to return in full bloody glory. However, while this film has its moments of tension and nostalgia, there are many points where the horror falls short and Jamie Lee Curtis' returning character, Laurie Strode, is sadly underused. Disregarding all the Halloween sequels that came before this movie was conceived, this 2018 film reboot of Halloween picks up 40 years after the events of the 1978 John Carpenter classic. Laurie Strode is now an old woman who has an estranged relationship with her daughter and lives in isolation from the rest of the neighborhood. Michael Myers is imprisoned in a psychiatric hospital, despondent and still as a statue. The film opens with two investigative journalists trying to write a piece on the events of Michael Myers' killing spree 40 years. They are clearly obsessed with his infamy, going so far as to track down Laurie Strode and get her perspective on the events; she didn't bite though.\n\tMichael Myers escapes because of a prison bus transfer gone wrong in the middle of nowhere. He effectively kills any witnesses, retrieves his familiar mask (after violently disposing of the previous owners), and goes to his neighborhood of potential victims. Presumably, his goal is to murder Laurie Strode and her offspring, killing any other humans along the way. This is more or less what we expect from a Halloween film, however, what would have made the film more fascinating is if it delved into the tortured psyche of Laurie Strode. Before Michael's escape, Laurie Strode appears as a crazy old lady stuck in her paranoid way which is the reason why her daughter Karen keeps herself and her family distant. Karen's daughter, Allyson, is a teenager who wonders why her grandmother is still obsessed with Michael after all these decades, but other than that she does normal teenager things like go to the Halloween dance and, later loses her cool when Myers begin his murder spree.     \nThis is actually one of the biggest problems with the film. It never really feels like a Halloween film, instead opting for a DJ style scratch and match of different pieces from each of the films in the franchise, even borrowing kills from the horror genre a large. There is a scene near the beginning of the film which perfectly highlights a lot of the problems the film has. In this scene, the family has been trying to coax the traumatized matriarch of the family out of her hiding all and into a Formica diner of sorts. The dialogue between the various people at the table is cut more like a fight scene than a plot device. The cutting is jumpy, sporadic, it lacks rhythm and most of all, it needlessly builds and discards tension without a payoff; one of the cardinal sins a form of the storytelling. The primary problem of the film is that whoever was its biggest mastermind has no sense of mood or tone.\nWe don't want to come off as though we didn't enjoy the film at all, quite to the contrary this is a very good Friday night Halloween rental. But it doesn't feel like an entry into the franchise that we have all waited so long to see a proper sequel to. Friends the franchise will no doubt be frustrated by the lack of innovation. We do, however, find that perhaps maybe younger viewers less familiar with the franchise will find it to be an exciting and funny addition to their horror movie repertoire. After all, we do spend countless scenes following Jamie Lee Curtis's granddaughter instead of developing any plot, it is a thread that is dropped cold without explanation, without connection to the other entries into the franchise. If you're looking for a movie that is worthy of the title, I guess we'll have to wait for another generation of filmmakers. With that being said, if you are looking for a pretty good slasher movie to pass the weekend with, this is where we think the movie fits best.  To sum it all up this movie (if it were a costume), would be perfect for the kid that loves to scare the crap out of people who has no idea who he wants to be. For the kid that wanted to be Michael Myers though, it's like getting a Frankenstein mask because it's all they had left.",

The attention to detail, the homages paid to the past with spoken: \"that's the idea\", and seen: a familiar sun hat on Laurie's wall. A brilliant mask, and Jamie Lee Curtis' performance all make this instant Classic a must see. In this Halloween some 40 years later, we find Michael Myers more vicious and extremely brutal in his killing methods. Also the depth of Curtis' character Laurie Strode can't be overstated. The PTSD that she's endured since 1978, how the experience has taken hold of her life, the failed marriage's and estrangement from her daughter, have all added new dimensions to this now mentally toughened character. If I had to sum this movie up in one word, it would be \"spooky\". To briefly name a few scenes which I found exceptionally chilling, they would be the scene at Smith's Grove, a handful of teeth in a gas station restroom, the reflection in the window, a teenager and some motion lights, Dr. Sartain's complete 180, and Michael's special jack-o'-lantern. The film had some comedic elements as well, particularly Jibrail Nantambu who played Julian. If there was ever a scene stealer in a Slasher film, he was it. His appearance was only brief, however very memorable with his one-liners and overall humor. With this being said, Halloween is a solid movie from beginning to end, and be sure to stay for the end credits to hear one of Laurie's favorite tunes from years past by.",

Aaron Korey played by Jefferson Hall brutally killed on screen shown bleeding to death as we all expected him having a larger role in the movie since he was largely shown in the trailer. another scene of interest is the last 30 minutes. I loved the reverse physcology put on Michael by Laurie. overall the movie is one of my favourite movies ever made and the overall movie itself is the movie I have always dreamed of. I put a 10/10 and Hope a second movie getting made with the ending having Michael dissapear from the burning basement. only time will tell, Big Love goes to John Carpenter, Cody Carpenter, David Gordon Green, Jason Blum, Malek Akkad,Michael Simmonds, Nick Castle for his amazing acting as Michael Myers and his Stun Man for such convincing kills and the star herself Jamie Lee Curtis for her amazing role as Laurie Strode",

Who'd have thought!) and an odd number of laughs thrown in that didn't seem to fit, there are also one completely unneccisary plot twist that added nothing to the story. None of those were as big an issue as the fact I didn't feel they did Michael justice. They toned down his supernatural side to make him seem more human (always a mistake) and his kills reminded me more of Jason Voorheese's style than his own. Lacking was the disturbing curiousity he used to show around his victims and he did very little in the way of toy them (like when he wore the sheet to pretend to be a ghost in the original). Michael also managed very little in the way of stalking.\n\nJamie Lee was superb (and I'd expect nothing less) and this is really Laurie's story not Michaels. Unfortunately this is also her fifth Halloween with three of her appearances being retconned by this movie, this somewhat reduces the impact of her story as we've seen different versions of it several times over. Also on the positive side was the superb soundtrack provided by John Carpenter and his son which helped to give the movie a bit more of an authentic feel. As is often the case the references to the original movie were blatantly and didn't really add anything. \n\nFinal note, this a replacement to Halloween 2 and it's suprisingly similar to that movie. Which ultimately leaves me wondering what the point was in taking this route. We now have three branching continuities of Halloween and that's not even taking in to account the Rob Zombie remake. Did we really need that?",

It wisely ignores all Halloween timelines and projects as a direct sequel to the original. Forever haunted by her encounter with Michael Myers 40 years ago, Laurie Strode has spent her life preparing herself and her family for the inevitable escape of 'The Shape' and his long pending return to Haddonfield, IL. After being apprehended in 1978 following the babysitter murders, he has spent the last 40 years locked up back in Smith's Grove with his doctor's, and the state ignoring Dr. Loomis's long ago given, strong recommendation that he should be executed. He is scheduled to be transferred from Smith's Grove, which during the transfer, he escapes custody and can return to the one thing he's only loved: killing and the white mask. Director and writer David Gordon Green gives the audience no insight into Michael's motivations for why he does the things he does, or why he seemingly won't die. The only shred of theory is given by his doctor, the protege of Dr. Loomis. He achieves in keeping the character of Michael Myers ambigiously absolute. Laurie Strode is all but excommunicated by her daughter and son-in-law for refusing to get the help she needs and make peace with her attempted murder 40 years ago. Her granddaughter is the only family member who wants her around and thinks she should be given a chance. Finally, Laurie's fears come to fruition and the family is forced to confront them together. Subjectively speaking, the film does a good job at capturing the essence of Michael except for his stalkerish ways. Where it slightly lacks in living up to the original is having scenes that are from Michael's perspective where in the original, it is told completely by Michael's prey and victims. Filled with suspense, jumps, brutal kills, comic relief and intelligent writing, it makes for a great horror film and solid addition to the Halloween franchise. Debra Hill I think would be most proud of the handling of her story and characters. A must scream for horror fans. Welcome home, Michael and Laurie. ",

            "content": "Let me start with the positives, because there are quite a few. Firstly, the performances were great all across the board. There really wasn't a single member of the cast that didn't give it their all. Jamie Lee Curtis, especially. She's just phenomenal in this film. Her portrayal of the effects of trauma on someone's mental state was perfect. All the scenes with her were golden. Judy Greer as Laurie's daughter, Karen, does a great job, as does Andi Matichak, who plays Laurie's granddaughter, Allyson. All in all, great work from the cast. They all turned in great performances.\n\nMichael Myers is scarier in this movie than he has ever been. Michael has always been a symbol of pure evil, and this movie does its very best to drive that home. The things he does in this movie are horrific and terrifying, and that's exactly the way it should be. I have to give credit to Danny McBride and his co-writers for nailing that aspect of the character. He is a force of pure evil and does not care about anyone or anything. This movie got that right, and I commend it.\n\nOne final positive to note is the direction. David Gordon Green does a beautiful job directing this movie. It feels like Halloween in this movie. The falling leaves, the jack o' lanterns, etc. There are a couple long takes in the middle of the film that are very impressive. Also, there's a clever thing that Green does in which he copies trademark shots from the original film while putting a specific twist on them. I thought that that was a really smart way to relate the themes of the film symbolically and visually. The cinematography was good too. It was a beautiful film to look at.\n\nNow, the negatives.\n\nThis movie completely fell apart at the beginning of the 3rd act. I won't spoil it, but a certain character does something that comes completely out of left field and is just mind boggling. The moment it happened, I turned to my brother and said, \"Dude, this is stupid.\" After this completely random and bizarre event occurs (Which by the way, has absolutely no effect on the plot) the rest of the film takes a nose dive. The climax is okay in certain moments, but overall very disappointing. There's a pretty suspenseful scene that takes place in Laurie's home, but otherwise, it was really mediocre; verging on bad.\n\nAlso, there were many instances of comedic relief that came at wildly inappropriate times. There is a child in this film that someone is babysitting and he exists solely as comedic relief. He literally comes into contact with Michael and the scene is played for laughs. There are also other scenes of random comedy scattered throughout, so it makes the film feel very tonally jarring a lot of the time. We go from being terrified at this force of evil, to laughing at the fact that a certain character packed a single brownie into his lunch. There was very little tonal consistency, especially in the last half. It reminded me of the Last Jedi in that way. *shutters*\n\nOverall, the new Halloween was fantastic for the first hour or so, but as soon as the 3rd act began, it just got worse and worse. Had the 3rd act been just as good as what came before, this movie would have been a solid 8 or 9, topping all the other sequels. However, because of just how disappointing the finale of the movie is, and the tonal inconsistency, I can't give it a score that high. It's better than many of the sequels, but I think the original 1981 Halloween II still has it beat. There were great moments in this movie. A lot of them. It's really a shame.",

It keeps the spirit of John Carpenter's original film and it feels as if Carpenter could have even directed some scenes. The 80s style synth music is a great old school sounding score with a modern take. At first, I felt bad for Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and what her later life has become. But she proves she is still tougher than ever. Even though it is a direct sequel to the original, it has references to the other previous movies. It does have some horror cliches we've seen so many times, but horror-heads will love it. Also, even though it's putting the previous movies aside and only focusing on the original, it still sort of plays out like those other sequels only ignoring Halloween: Resurrection. In other words, maybe they didn't have to ignore all the sequels. The film has amazing tension, it captures the spirit of the holiday, it feels like it fits with the original, and Myers is still eerie in every way possible. The only thing that would have made this better would have been a cameo by Busta Rhymes, just kidding. - Nile Fortner Instagram @nile_fortner Twitter @Nile_Fortner YouTube - Nile Fortner Google + - Nile Fortner Cinephellas.com We Live Entertainment ComicAttack.net My South Florida Today BocaWatch.org Independent Streak Magazine ",

            "content": "As a long time fan of the \"Halloween\" franchise I was intrigued when I learned that Horror Master John Carpenter would be taking a hands on role in the latest installment of the fabled saga that Carpenter himself unleashed onto the world way back in 1978. In fact, this was the first Michael Myers Halloween film that Carpenter had been involved with since Halloween II in 1981. I was even more intrigued to learn that this latest installment would completely disavow the storylines from every other Halloween film that came AFTER the original 1978 classic. If that wasn't enough, it would be divulged in one of the first official trailers of the new film that Michael Myers, aka \"The Boogieman\" and Laurie Strode, the survivor of the first stab fest in 1978, ARE NOT BROTHER AND SISTER. For fans of the series, it was revealed in the 1981 sequel, \"Halloween II\" that Myers and Strode were siblings and that he wanted to kill Laurie, much like he killed his other sister, Judith Myers when he was 6 years old, which was documented during the opening scenes of the 1978 original film. So, we are left to wonder, why is Michael Myers so hell bent on finally killing Laurie Strode after all of these years. Well, when you see this latest installment you would be hard pressed to get any clarity to that answer. So, this film is really another redux of a sequel to the original 1978 film fast forward 40 years. So, instead of Michael getting up after being shot six times by Michael's psychiatrist and falling off the balcony of Tommy Doyle's house only to continue the nights rampage in the 1981 sequel, Michael is apprehended and is incarcerated at a state mental hospital where he has remained for the last 40 years. As far as Laurie Strode goes, again played by original scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis, the last 40 years have not been kind to her. During this film, the audience learns that she has been married and divorced twice, she has 2 kids, one of which, her daughter, was taken from her custody when the girl was 12 years old. She also spent the last 40 years living in constant fear and paranoia and also preparing and praying that Michael would escape custody and, once again, come after her. Her back woods home was basically a fortress built on the fear that Michael would come after her again, decked out with security cameras, flood lights and enough weapons for a small army. But without giving away too much of the plot, what I really enjoyed about this movie was that it did pay homage to the films that came before it even if those storylines were basically erased from history. When I say paying homage to the other films I'm referring to that several of the scenes of this film were framed to look like or resemble scenes from the previous films, which fans of the series will know what I am talking about. But at the end of the day, this was a pretty good horror movie that resembled and had the traits of its 1978 predecessor, genuine scares without getting too bogged down on trying to figure out what made Michael ticked. Just like the original film, this installment still really didn't divulge why Michael is obsessed with Laurie and that makes Michael that much more dangerous and that much more frightening, to wonder what set Michael off and why, after 40 years, why he still had an unquenchable thirst and desire to kill, and to keep on killing, of which, me may never know the answer to.",

I'm quite surprised at the positive reviews abound on the web, probably gleaned from nostalgia and the aforementioned cinematography and excellent sound design (with some superb versions of the classic Halloween theme impressing at key moments!)\n\nGo in with low expectations and you'll enjoy yourself for two hours.",

This is one of the first films I have ever seen that had my expectations up and did not disappoint. I absolutely loved it from start to finish.

My only complaint was the tweaking of the original theme song by John Carpenter. I get chills from just hearing those piano keys play as it\u2019s tense and brings an immediate spook so that was somewhat of a bummer. Still a Definite Recommend!",

They made it were it's just the original 1978 Halloween and 40 years later it's this one. The story line flows well defines its characters with ease and it creates a realistic environment making the movie believable. There are no possessions or supernatural monsters in this, it's simply a psychotic murderer that does not stop. It brings back all of the old gruesome deaths that we all remember from the old one and takes it up another level. Simply put this will give slasher movies a bump that they need, just as the first one did. Jamie Lee Curtis was superb as to be expected she embodies her character making you feel sympathy for what she is going through along with giving you reason to root for her. Surprising the film dives into the workings of the inner mind in a way creating something different for you to process during the film. In the end, if you are a horror fan, old school slasher flick fan, or just a movie fan go see it in theaters and enjoy the ride.",

The best parts were in the 2nd act when Michael is wandering around. I know it had Easter eggs and had semi-tributes to the movies in the franchise, but it felt like it was a summary of all the films in one, which is not a good thing. James Jude Courtney did a good job, except he walked around a little weird at times, but so did Dick Warlock. With that said overall he did a good job as Myers. It was surprisingly not better than H2 though IMO. Maybe it's the nostalgia factor. I was hoping for \"Mr. Sandman\" to pop up at some point on a radio or something.

The humor was inappropriate at times (horrible in one particular scene), the new psychologist was bordering on superfluous, and the British podcasters were not much more than a plot device. Those things being said, the movie is incredible. Jamie Lee Curtis turns in an astounding performance as Laurie Strode, who is both weaker and stronger after the terror of the original Halloween. Stronger--she is tough and has prepared herself for fighting Michael Myers for 40 years. And weaker--she suffers from PTSD and has allowed it to damage her familial relationships. Both sides are portrayed well--stellar performance! Judy Greer does excellently as Karen Strode. Virginia Gardner delivers a decent performance, as does the man who plays her father. The boys in the film seem like typical high school boys and serve their purpose, though one of the characters could have been more compelling. Michael Myers was menacing, unstoppable, and straightforward in his kills. The suspense in most of the scenes was pulled off masterfully. The Third Act was intense and dramatic -- genuine edge of your seat quality! This isn't a slasher flick devoted to murdering dumb, young hedonists that you feel indifferent about at best. No, you care about Laurie and her struggles, and this care is made all the more palpable in the Third Act. The soundtrack was beautiful and added tremendously to the suspense and ambience of the film. Love this movie. Will be buying it on Blu-Ray. 4/5 Stars",

Also wondered if they would finally bring Michael to his definite end but they've handled the suspense perfectly! Is he gone? I'm not convinced I reckon it'll split opinion almost 50/50. I've been looking forward to this for a very very long time and I wasn't disappointed. May even go back and see it again.... And I've never done that with any movie.

Even if this may seem like a negative, it actually works well for the film, keeping the audience on its toes between all the carnage. Jamie Lee Curtis delivers a strong performance, conveying the ptsd attributed to her surviving all those years prior convincingly. And yet, when she had to throw down with demon from her past, she did just that and then some. One of the more effective aspects of the film is how Michael relentlessly stalks and kills his randomly picked victims. Unlike the sequels after Carpenter's original, Michael doesn't seem to be after anyone in particular. He just wants, or maybe even needs to kill. Halloween packs a mean punch and nobody is safe from Michaels swath of bloodshed. As for acting, Judy Greer is spectacular as Laurie's resentful and distant daughter. As the movie progressed, she transforms from emotionally hurt duckling to a likeable daughter/mother. Andi Matichak turns in a decent performance, bringing an emotional depth to her character that isn't ever fully developed. The male actors suffer the most in this film. Will Patton is the only male character that seems decent and even his way of handling Laurie is a bit red-flaggish. The high school guys all come off like jerks and they aren't developed to any point where it matters if they meet the blade or not. The pod cast crew is annoying and deliberately inappropriate, serving well the transition from the original film to the present one. All in all, a great film, even with a minor misstep that seems present solely to deliberately move the plot forward.",

It is refreshing to finally see John Carpenters original vision of a mortal man, not an invincible or magic monster, but a genuine mentally ill evil psychopath return in a sequel. What drew fans to the first film has been missed by every previous sequel, which is the site of Michael Myers while he is watching and pursuing. The act of grotesque killing is rarely what is scary or memorable. The most difficult part of any scary movie is often the ending and this version of Halloween is no exception, it didn't live up to the original although that might be the best ending to any horror film.

Laurie is trying to reconnect with her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak). As the bus transfer crashes, Michael escapes. And is back on his killing spree. Laurie tries to gather her family to safety and plotting to kill Michael. I am sure it has a plot that has been done before with slasher films. McBride and David Green's script tries to add some freshness to it. The opening moments in the psych ward after two journalists want to speak to Myers. And the opening credits with John Carpenter's theme song brought back. The film sets up the setting with characters like Laurie's daughter and her granddaughter. While they fear that Laurie is still disturbed and needs help. While her paranoia is getting her prepared to face what is about to come. When Michael does escape, he is back on his killing spree. The kills are not as gory or bloody. Just quick deaths with the characters and maybe one or two aftermath disturbing scene with the dead bodies. The suspense build up does bring some chills. Especially on a scene were Michael walks into some random persons house to kill them with a hammer and walk out with a kitchen knife. The film does have that typical horror movie clich\u00e9 with stupidity. Wish they could have left out and done something smarter with characters choices. Such as a teen girl slipping when being chased. Or characters letting Michael grab them without putting much of a fight back. But the film makes up for it in the last 20 minutes. When Michael and Laurie are facing against each other. As she is putting up a fight and trying to kill. Jamie Lee Curtis is great. Judy Greer and Andi Matichak are great. At least they did not make much bad decisions. Will Patton plays a police officer that is trying to stop Myers. Overall, Halloween is a good slasher film. It brings a fresh take on a dying franchise. Especially, when Rob Zombie ruined it. It feels like a true sequel after the original movie. There may not be gory deaths, or scary. But it does have its suspense. Jamie Lee Curtis shines along with new cast members like Judy Greer and Andi Matichak. I am excited to see were they can take another movie. Hope they can leave out the clich\u00e9s of stupidity.",

I spent literal YEARS hiding under my blankets in Santa Cruz, completely afraid of The Shape, staying up all night fearful that I would one day hear that iconic breathing through the white mask.  I can still remember it to this day.  This movie continues the story of what I consider the scariest movie of all time.  The reason why I think Halloween (1978) is the all time greatest is simple: it's a basic story that \"could\" be wrapped in reality.  Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, those are all based in fantasy worlds where unbelievable super-villains roam the world killing random horny teenagers.  Michael Myers was immediately given a back story (murders his sister and parents, locked up and escapes, etc.), which made his story rooted in REALITY.  To me, that was something that drove fear into my heart as a child.  This movie was an excellent continuation of the original story, with plenty of homages to the original script.  Jamie Lee Curtis does such a commendable job as a damaged and grisled PTSD vitcim, preparing for 40 years for her nightmare to return.  It was so nice to see Nick Castle reprise his role as Michael, and his tall and lean frame exuding the haunting depth that really struck a nerve in me as a kid.  While a few sub-plots didn't work, and I wasn't necessarily \"scared\" by this movie, I felt like this was a chapter that needed to happen.  I was able to completely forget about all of the (lame) sequels and just focus on the here and now -- and to me, this makes this movie a success in my book.  I loved it.  Happy Halloween, Michael.",

The plodding plot completely lacks suspense and creativity and never develops into the edge of your seat horror flick that Carpenter delivered to audiences once upon a time. Not to mention (spoiler alert), Halloween (2018) is simply the latest in an endless string of weak Hollywood movies that can't seem to come up with an escape situation that doesn't include a prisoner transport bus.

So I have to hand it to them for resurrecting a film series that was pretty subpar from the first sequel on, flagrantly retconning its last nine films, then somehow delivering a fitting sequel to the seminal 1978 original. David Gordon Green's Halloween joins Mad Max: Fury Road and Blade Runner 2049 in the small but growing echelon of successful decades-late soft reboots, and from beginning to end I was grinning from ear to ear.\n\nI decided on a lark a few hours before I attended the screening to reacquaint myself with John Carpenter's classic original in order to more properly gauge the fan service, and the new film has it in spades. From the OG title card font to some very clever scene parallels, the 40 year gap between films is bridged almost seamlessly, hindered only by the unfortunate absence of Donald Pleasence (since, y'know, he's been dead for 23 years). The pacing, dread, and gore of the original are all here but suitably amped up a bit for modern audiences, as even the frat bro sitting next to me was audibly disturbed by a few of the kill scenes. Plus, you can't really beat the iconic score that permeates the runtime, keeping the dark atmosphere amidst the more perfunctory and predictable passages.\n\nWhat elevates the film past meeting the baseline expectations set out by the original is that the movie reminds us that slasher flicks can be a lot of fun. In terms of dialogue, the exposition is treated with the proper amount of import to maintain tonal balance. Sure it's ham, but it's closer to prosciutto than Lunchables meat. As for the extraneous character driven moments, they range from naturally conversational to straight up comedic, and I wish Jamie Lee Curtis had told me after I'd been inducted to NHS \"Screw college, go to Mexico.\" Speaking of Jamie Lee, it's obvious that her break through lead role has led her to this labor of love, and she's joined by an equally committed cast. This could have been a disaster or another easy cash-grab, but Halloween won't disappoint for horror fans and general audiences alike.",

Also, I dont have Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or any other social media, except this Rotten Tomatoes account which I literally just created in order to submit this review at 1:39am after watching this movie. So please believe me when I say this is one of the worst pieces of garbage I've ever seen in my life. How this movie has the rating that it has and how anybody can claim that it is in anyway good on any level I have no clue.\n\nLet me show my work. For one, none of the murders Michael Myers commits is stylized, unique, gruesome or terrifying beyond one head stomping which was directly taken from Rob Zombie's Halloween 2. In fact, most of the killings don't take place on camera at all and the movie isnt actually scary as theres no gore, no tension and not even any good jump scares because all the scenes are so predictable. Second, there is very little character development (especially for Laurie's daughter and her family) and the acting is average at best. Toss in an M Night Shyamalan-esque plot twist with Michael Myers psychiatrist which makes very little sense and an ending sequence which is so absurd, campy (que the etching on the bottom of the rifle) and full of holes that half of the theatre that I was in actually started laughing. I mean, Laurie Strode literally becomes a character which combines Ripley from Alien, Macgyver and Sarah Connor. Wow. Just wow that was bad.\n\nNow for the good parts of the movie. Michael Myers mask is really cool and the kid who was being babysat was absolutely hilarious (best part of the movie). That is all.\n\nIn the end, I'm not saying dont go watch this movie because I did and you probably will too, regardless. This is just a warning and confirmation that other people were also fooled by these high profile movie critics and that you're not the only one who feels this way about this awful movie.",

Too many nods (some appreciated). How many more nods will be in the obvious sequel? I had hope but Blumhouse isn't a good fit for this series. They should stick to The Purge and Valentine's Day. David and Danny clearly had their hands all over this with the comedy throughout. Not taking away from many good scenes but the camera work was atrocious. The ONLY great shot was the pan up of Michael in the house after he got his hand shot off. GREAT shot because you can't see him very well. That's why Michael was so scary to me. This movie made him look like the lead in a sitcom. Jamie was good. The doctor turning on the cop made me want to scream in anger. It was like a nod to H6 which should've never happened.

            "content": "John Carpenter's Halloween is my all-time favourite horror film. Always has been, always will be. I've generally enjoyed most of the sequels, but everything after Halloween H20 has been a dumpster fire. When I heard they told Rob Zombie to fu*k off I was ecstatic. When I heard they were doing a direct sequel to the original I was excited. When I heard John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis were returning my expectations immediately became unrealistic. After months of anticipation, I saw the film twice opening weekend, and had completely different reactions each time. This review is a tale of two Halloweens.\n\nThe hype machine was building for a long time. Everything I'd seen and heard about the movie had me pumped...but when I actually saw it, I left the theatre disappointed. When I began to think about why, the answer was simple - I'd spent the entire time comparing it to the original. It wasn't paced the same, it wasn't edited the same, it didn't feel like a 1970s horror movie. I don't know why I expected this to be exactly like the original, but I did, and that was stupid. Needless to say when I saw it a second time and actually judged it on its own merits, rather than constantly comparing it, I completely changed my tune. The movie sure isn't perfect, but it's quickly become one of my favourites in the series.\n\nThere are two things that make Halloween work - it disregards all the sequels, and the Carpenter influence is felt for the first time in a long time. Let's just ignore all the ridiculous things that happened to Michael Myers in the subsequent films, and that stupid brother/sister twist introduced in Halloween 2 is finally gone! What this movie does with Laurie Strode is a far more satisfying continuation for the character than what we got in H20. Although the real surprise is the fact they actually made Michael Myers scary and interesting again. For the first time in forty years they've brought the mystery back to the character. Everyone has their theories about what makes Michael tick, but thankfully we're given no answers. Once you start to explain why (family, cults, abuse), you take away everything that made him scary in the first place. He's the boogeyman, plain and simple.\n\nThere really is a lot to love in Halloween. Jamie Lee Curtis pours her heart and soul into the movie, John Carpenter's score is pure synth gold, and director David Gordon Green done a fine job re-creating the small town atmosphere and suspense of the original. It's gory, but not Friday the 13th gory, the humour (mostly) works, and there are plenty of nods to past Halloweens that longtime fans will appreciate. The story works well, but at times feels a little bloated, and certain characters are sadly underdeveloped because of it. Although the only thing I truly disliked about the movie was a five minute chunk in the third act that's just downright stupid. Otherwise this is a solid entry that puts the franchise back on the right track.\n\n\nAfter more than a decade of crappy sequels and remakes, Halloween 2018 truly is a treat for fans of the franchise. It's a wonderful blend of nostalgia and evolution that genuinely feels like a continuation of the original Halloween, and not a copy. It rightfully brings the series back to its roots, while also giving the audience something new. The performances are strong, the characters are likeable, it's atmospheric, funny, tense, and surprisingly well-written. I guess it's a good sign when my biggest complaint about the movie is why they couldn't just call it Halloween Returns.",

I'm really mad that I'm writing this but most of the scary movies lately have been all comedy relief and forget what it takes to be the best scary movie of the year. Or even a scary movie, making this a violent comedy and a disappointment to the originals. Honestly I wish I didn't watch it not knowing what happens makes it scarier then actually seeing the movie.

However, other than that, I still loved this movie and I was still happy/entertained.

            "content": "I give the movie all five stars. It was well written, directed, and paced. The first act follows basic formula with Michael being locked up at Smith's Grove Sanitarium then by some extreme means escapes again to go on a rampage in Haddonfield, Illinois to relive the same night back in Halloween 1978. This is a movie for both old and new fans mostly for the older fans of the original. Continuity wise the movie is a direct sequel to the original ignoring all the sequels including Halloween 2 which some fans may or may not like, but for valid reasons may be for the best since it brings Michael back to his roots as the unpredictable evil force of nature that he is. The movie contains references to other films of the series true fans would appreciate mainly one nodding to the Silver Shamrock masks from Halloween 3 shown in one scene. Another aspect of the movie that was great was it's use of cinematography mostly around the parts of Michael stalking his prey giving you the fear of being watched capturing the tone of the original, but with more advanced camera equipment. (SPOILERS START) There's a few plot twists that seem far fetched like the evil psychologist (maybe a Halloween 6 reference), but works well for the film for the better when the plot is instantly thrown away by Michael when the evil doctor becomes one of his victims showing Michael is a force that can't be controlled. Another campy moment was two goofy cops talking about what they're eating for lunch, but I was under the impression they were a reference to the two goofy cops from 5 which still works well for the movie. After that's all out of the way we get to the climax where Laurie faces Michael one last time. Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her roll again as Laurie Strode from the original and does a magnificent performance that really draws you in. After 40 years Laurie Strode is ready for Michael arming herself with multiple fire arms living in a house with trap doors and secret passageways, but at the same time suffering from post traumatic stress and grief that drives a wedge between her and her family except her granddaughter. The final act focuses on Laurie's final standoff against Michael which is the most exciting and suspenseful part in the movie that draws you in from start to finish. (SPOILERS END)  Overall I thought it was the best film of the franchise and if you're a fan of the original this one is a must see.",

So this one, is a remake of Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, with Laurie Strode, still in the picture and Michael's niece playing a lesser role. Mixed with Halloween H20, when it deleted it's previous installments to bring back Laurie Strode. So this one deletes all previous installments including H20, and the remakes and takes place as if Michael was caught on Halloween night 40 years ago. It's a shame, Halloween II (the original, haha) was dope.... As with Halloween 4, Michael is being transferred, shit happens he breaks free and goes after his family, but in this alternate universe Laurie didn't die in a car accident and left her daughter, in this, she goes full on Sarah Conner, and prepares, because she knew Michael would escape one day, raising her daughter John Conner style also in preparation, which neither John nor Laurie's daughter took seriously til crap when down!! And yep, Mikey makes his way back to Haddonfield in time for Halloween and of course the Halloween dance at the high school. So the whole teen element of this one was kind of pointless, just seems to be added in to attract the younger audiences to an R-rated film? I dunno. I guess that one teen is also Michaels niece so... And just how supernatural is Michael... how is he able to track down a group of teens, who all go their separate ways, and he hasn't been in town for 40 years. Smith's Grove must have the internet for inmates. All leading to a showdown between Ellen and the Queen Alien, crap, I mean all leading to Laurie and a showdown with her bro... Any real fans of the series, and I mean those in between sequels, part 6 in particular, the Cult of Thorn, I'm pretty sure they're hinted at in this, not sure, just my thought... As a whole I liked it, i liked the different slices of the other films in the series. (Spot the Season of the Witch masks?) Will there be a Halloween 2.

What one forgets about the original Halloween is the lack of blood in the movie and the constant tension/jump scares. Shadows and creepy music throughout. The stuff of nightmares. This Halloween.....not so much. They have turned Jamie Lee Curtis Laurie Strode into a complete nut and basketcase. Michael Myers is locked up for 40 years and you turn your residence into Fort Knox with trap doors/secret basement and an arsenal enough for an Army Base??? Seriously??? Characters come and go and you could care less. One scene I did enjoy was the backyard scene with the sensor lights going on and off. That was about it. I was very excited going into this movie and very disappointed walking out. What movie were the critics watching??? I thought they blew it with the lousy Hereditary movie but this one might just top it for huge horror disappointment. I told my buds walking out of the theatre...if there's a sequel to this mess, this is one guy who will NOT be paying $15 to see it. It's been real Michael Myers but I am done, finite....kaput......no more Halloween movies for me...........",

The acting was most likely the best since the original  two and the storyline wasn't bad either you can tell that they really wanted to have a decent plot and distance their self from all the other Halloween movies that were just supposed to forget about. I do have a hard time trying to act like the other Halloween movies never happened  though. I also did have an issue with Laurie Strode just coming back from the dead I mean they didn't even try to cover it up they just tried to run with it like she never died  and then turning her into rambo was very silly plus her hide out with all her traps was kinda outta hand but it still didn't hurt the movie. Their was a few laughs that normally I don't like but the kid cracking back with his baby sitter wasn't to bad and actually worked for the movie. Now to the Violence  I must say I enjoyed Michaels violent nature in this movie.Look when you go to a slasher or monster film its to see the character  run wild and cause havoc and thats what Michael Myers(who is the star of the movie)dose in this movie causes chaos. Will Halloween win any awards the answer is no it will not but if your a fan of Michael Myers then you will like this movie.",

As far as we're concerned, everything past the end of the first film didn't happen! And IMHO, there's more good than bad because of it.\n\nAt one hour & 46 minuets, there's a solid beginning, middle, & payoff to this film's plot; with setup & development for most of the cast, ending with a......wait, don't wanna spoil things. A high point of my viewing was playing spot the reference, there were quite a few, but they weren't annoyingly in your face.\n\nThe cast was awesome! Jamie Lee Curtis still hasn't lost her touch! I believed her as someone who went through a trauma & then spent decades using prepping to cope with the resulting PTSD. The folks playing her family did well. Judy Greer really sells it as Laurie's daughter, a person robbed of their childhood, due to parental baggage. Andi Matichak as Laurie's granddaughter was a typical modern teenager, very believable. And I was surprised to find Toby Huss, or as I know him, ARTIE, THE STRONGEST MAN.....IN THE WORLD, playing Laurie's son-in-law; he sorta took a back seat, but he was entertaining when we saw him. The rest of the cast added their own subtle flavors & textures to this pumpkin pie of a film, making it all the sweeter. Michael has returned to his roots, he IS The Shape, able to use whatever's on hand, or just his two hands, to do what he does best! No reason, no method to the madness. He. Just. Kills. And that's what makes him so awesomely terrifying.\n\nThe effects were minimal, & all practical. We went to real locations, each one with their own atmosphere of dread. Despite knowing what was gonna happen, they were able to build a solid amount of tension without relying on too many cheep jump scares\n\nThe music was pure Halloween. They didn't use the main theme or the classic score too much or too little, it was juuust right.\n\nHalloween (2018) was a Halloween sequel WORTHY of being a Halloween sequel! It made Michael Audrey Myers frightening again. And while we may have lost the continuity of the second film, this one really made up for how bad the post H5 films were! I just wish the guy who originally produced these films had lived to see this one. I'm giving it 4 pumpkins outta 5! Happy Halloween, I can't wait to see what comes next; 'cause you KNOW he ain't dead, as the best slashers never die!",

I liked a lot of stuff, but first, the bad:\n\n There were a lot of pointless characters and silly, goofy humor to scoff at that cheapened and snuffed out all chance of scariness. There was a scene running through the woods that led nowhere and could've been deleted and no one would miss it. Everything relating to the podcast wasn't necessary. A conversation about sandwiches was distracting, mindnumbing and should have been cut. Corny lines like \"Gotcha\" and \"Happy Halloween\" didn't need to be added. The plot twist with the doctor was cheesy and a desperate attempt to give unnecessary explanation. These things dumbed down the movie that, for the first maybe half, was mostly going in the right direction. \n\nAlso, there was little room for suspense. Michael Myers rushed to gory killings and did very little of the creepy stalking that made him such a nightmare creepy killer. His character was reduced to a cheap slasher in many instances. Also, he was shown without his mask way too much and it took away from The Shape.\n\nSo what did I like? The opening credits really made me want to watch the rest of the movie. Most of the music was really good until it seemed to get louder and more cheesy. Michael Myers did a pretty good job of moving like Michael Myers most of the time. The acting was surprisingly good all around. I was worried about Laurie Strode being too Rambo but it stayed tasteful. I liked it. Much like Sarah Conner.\n\nTo sum it up, the music and lights were toned down and the fat and fluff was edited out, along with the cheesiness and attempt at comedy, this would have made me pretty happy. More stalking and less gore would have made it scary and pretty awesome. Nice try.",

            "content": "From the early announcements of preproduction, this movie boasted itself a true tribute to John Carpenter's immortal classic, promising to be a reprisal to the original's masterful minimalism and intimacy, only to serve as it's modern day antithesis. The original, a slow-building masterpiece of suspense and dread, was modernized to a fast paced and overcomplicated extroversion in celebration of the original's 40th anniversary. Despite the hype, this film goes out of it's way to contradict everything special about it's source material in a fashion all too common in the genre today.\n\nOf all it's offenses, it's worst is glaring: it simply wasn't scary. In wanting to exist outside of genre tropes, it sacrifices horror for it's prioritized drama, action and comedy. David Gordon Green does well to avoid cl\u00eeched jump scares by avoiding scares all together, sometimes even having you laugh during a murder. Murder means nothing in this movie (a serious misstep for a slasher film), serving only as gratuitous action sequences to rack up a bodycount. Moments that could have been quite suspenseful are filled with soundtrack, dialogue, or quickness. The Michael we knew wasn't muscle slaughtering the lambs of an infinitely generating cast; he was a ghostly apparition who quietly preyed on three babysitters, watching from afar with such patience, only to get closer and closer, and when he could finally reach, he stung, not for the sake of murder, but to watch how they'd behave in his hands. He was a genuine-fucking-creep, and that nuanced eeriness is replaced with an obvious masculine mindlessness.\n\nMeta references to the franchise and the film's self awareness may have worked well in Wes Craven's Scream (1996), but these postmodern gestures served no function in Halloween (2018) other than to patronize fans, featuring easter eggs that may have pleased Marvel audiences but does little to keep you present. In one monologue, a high school student references the original as being pale to numb desensitized modern audiences, and it's in this philosophy that the movie fails to deliver on it's promises. And it's wrong - the original film does hold up! Television screenings, film restorations, soundtrack pressings, horror conventions, merchandising, and theatrical screenings have proven audiences are not too far gone to enjoy the sophisticated suspense Carpenter brought to audiences in 1978.\n\nTo it's credit, the movie has some genuine moments that will make you swell up, brilliant humor, and witty dialogue, but these moments ultimately did not save it from it's excessive character development and extroverted killings.\n\nIt may be a surprise to say I rank this film amongst the lowest in the franchise, but it's for its missed opportunity and broken promises that I cannot support this attempt. With all of it's easter eggs to show the fans they truly understood the series, this movie mischaracterizes the original more than any film preceding.\n\nWe waited forty years - for this?",

For starters, the humor is in small doses throughout the film, and creates a personality for the characters in it. Second, the gore isn't over the top, but creates a sense that Micahel is back and ready. Some deaths are nods to previous throughout the series, and others are new and creative. They create a good sense of horror and fear that Micahel has been waiting to feed his insatiable bloodlust. Lastly, the cast does a fantastic job. The cast portrays each character in typical Halloween fashion. Jamie Lee Curtis does amazing as allows and so do her counterparts. I tip my hat to the writers and directors of this film for such a great rollercoaster of horror, fear, suspense, and story. \n\nMy only issue with the film is the story lacks a good 5-10 minutes of tying up loose ends. Please don't read farther if you do not want anything SPOILED. Michael was not shot in the first film so he is alive. Myers was captured by officer Dawkins rather than being shot 5-6 times in the torso. How he was captures, what happened during that process, and how they managed to keep him contained for so many years are all things I want answered. The last one question is a simple one but one sentence would've done that question justice. \n\nOtherwise, the film was amazing and different in the best way possible. It stuck to its roots and yet expanded it all in a short hour and forty minutes. The film does not drag at all and I would recommend it to old fans, horror buffs, or even newcomers to a bloody franchise.",

None of the other films, including maybe even the original, have stressed so much the unease of not knowing what makes him tick.\n\nThe tight camerawork also may come closest to the original to Michael more of a menacing thing than man. The scares are kept pretty varied as the direction for Michael's appearances and kills shift seamlessly between subtle and in-your-face. In an age when slashers have become predictable, this movie manages to surprise at points in its ferocity.\n\nThe film looks good in general with the whole thing having this 70s look that manages to utilize darkness without sacrificing color. The opening sequence is a very effective and weird-little variation on the original into. The classic music theme is back. \n\nThe script does a surprisingly good job of delving into the emotional and psychological aftermath of Michael's killings. There is a lot of setup and exposition before Michael escapes, but the dialogue is so smooth, it isn't an issue. There are actually a few funny lines spread throughout.\n\nI really liked Jamie Lee Curtis' performance as Laurie Strode even more than her portrayal in H20, and she was already pretty good in that. Here she is a half-crazed, survivalist grandma suffering from PSTD. Curtis easily switches between tough and tormented. Credit should also be given to Andi Matichak as the granddaughter. She gives a good job of playing the new young heroine, and I kind of wished she had more screentime.\n\nOnly big knitpick is that the authorities use movie logic here, and there is some suspension of disbelief in how they handle things.",

There should be more back story to why Michael Myers is evil and kills.",

It captures the tone of Carpenter's film and Jamie Lee Curtis is quite good in her best role of the series.  The only thing that blemishes it is that a couple of characters kindof disappear without storyline resolution and the ending feels a bit rushed.. but other than that I quite liked the movie..",

            "content": "A return to form for this franchise. A direct sequel to Halloween (1978) this film retcons all of the sequels (even kinda making fun of the absurdity of them during the film). The film takes place 40 years after the events of the first film. Michael Myers (Nick Castle) is being transferred from the mental institute he's been at for the last 40 years. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is still around the town of Haddonfield, but has become a bit of a recluse and paranoid. Laurie isn't quite the \"scream queen\" she was back in 1978. She's been prepping herself for the return of Michael and learning everything she needs to know, so that she's basically never in a vulnerable position again. Because of all this she's become estranged from her daughter Karen (Judy Greer). Her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) stays in contact with her and is always trying to include her in their life still regardless of her moms wishes. Well if you've seen any horror film obviously something goes down and Michael is back on Halloween night seeking not just Laurie, but killing endlessly. The plot is pretty simple here and well it doesn't actually need to be complex for it to work. Michael is as creepy as ever. Not speaking a word with just his heavy breathing feeling in some scenes. The gore and kills are intense in this one. There's some extremely brutal and gory scenes in this one. It works well. I can't say much more. The characters work well here and if I had to gripe I would have liked to get a bit more of the back story between Laurie and Karen. We kind of just jump into what's going on, but it reveals itself nicely. I really enjoyed Will Patton as Officer Hawkins. I actually found him to be one of my more favorite characters since he always has a great on screen presence. Overall, a great horror film that continues the tradition of the first film. It has the perfect blend of horror, gore and story. I definitely recommend checking this one out!",

This is an excellent horror film and a great sequel, scary as hell! David Gordon Green does a fantastic job creating suspenseful atmosphere here, as well as with the amazing, long tracking shots of Michael Myers as he stalks his next victim. With the use of silence in certain scenes, paired with the brutal kills, this is easily one of my favorite horror films this year, right next to A Quiet Place.\nOne thing this script does quite well is building upon the lore of The Shape and laying to rest some issues or questions you may have had with many of the previous sequels or remakes.\n\nSeeing as how Danny McBride wrote part of this script, I feel it's safe to say some of the more grounded comedic moments in the film came from his hand. If you've ready any of my horror/thriller reviews, you'll know I am generally not a fan of the way comedy is sprinkled throughout; just look at how I felt about The Nun. With this film, I loved the comedic elements, where they were placed to add some humanity and a lighter air in those moments. But I know these moments will rub some others the wrong way, and that's perfectly fine. Of course the music from John Carpenter just puts you in the zone seeing this film on the big screen too. Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie suffering from PTSD all those years, she knocks this role out of the park, as expected; she is THE scream queen. This time around she's calculating, manipulative, lethal - everything she brings adds that much to the story. And Nick Castle reprising his role as Michael Myers, just as menacing as ever!",

Like yeah, they had their moments, but in comparison to this, they look like trash.\n\nThis is a film for Halloween 1978 purists; it has the same DNA, random kills, simple plot, and mystery; it even poses the same questions as the original: Is Michael a man or a supernatural force? He's both.\n\nThe sibling plot was dropped, first introduced in Halloween 2, and this was perhaps the best decision they could ever make, because it made Michael scary again... Nobody is safe, and you don't have to be related to him to be his victim.\n\nIt was certainly the best film since probably Halloween 2, and I may even rank it higher now.\n\nIt isn't without its flaws, particularly the Dr. Sartain subplot, but this was clearly a nod to Halloween 6, and the Dr. Wynn character, also a clever metaphorical way of saying he wanted to be Michael, much like the obsessed fans of the real world. There were so many hidden messages, breaking the lines between fiction and reality, even the pumpkin intro at the start of the movie was basically saying 'Halloween is back', as a rotted old pumpkin reforms into the familiar trademark one from the original film.\n\nFor the first time, we see Michael scared, and the roles are reversed, Laurie becomes the stalker, and it works so well.\n\nFor a fan of the original, this was a dream come true, a modern version, a return for the classic characters, and everything was ramped up to the max.\n\nI look forward to seeing more. Michael lives on, for a new generation to appreciate.\n\n9.5/10",

With that out of the way I will say this, Best Movie of 2018, with out a doubt Jamie Lee Curtis in this movie is awesome, her role as Lori Strode is outstanding. The synopsis is as follows, a group of journalists go to interview Michael at the State Penetrenty he is staying in. When the journalist's leave and Michael is being transported to a new Prison the bus breaks down and Michael Escapes, from there he goes around town slashing people and trying to kill Lori. John Carpenter did a great job on this Soundtrack, the movie has many throwbacks to the original such as the amazing closet scene, as well as the Balcony Scene. Overall I would say David Green and the cast did an amazing job and I would recommend you no matter if you don't like slasher movies to go see this film. 4.5/5",

During a Halloween season that is severely lacking in competition, this is hands-down the horror flick to see.  While the film benefits from essentially wiping the slate clean from all the installments since the original, this also serves as a hindrance--at least to those who have followed the franchise up to this point.  There are numerous nods to the previous films but while some may see it as paying homage, others will be likely look at it as rehashing old material.  On the other hand, being the 11th incantation of the franchise, trying to be new and original is a monumentally difficult task as the Friday the 13th franchise has proven time and time again.  Still, despite its flaws, it stands a quality slasher that delivers everything you would want in a horror movie.

In fact, I don't recall ever paying to see any of the Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies so this needed to happen.  Not only did I need to warp my reality even more but this movie seemed like it could be the end of an era, and after seeing it I think it really could be the end of an era.\n\nThe thing I like most about this is that every Halloween movie between the first one and this one can be thrown out and no one would even notice.  It connected perfectly with the first and only the first, and that was ironically also my biggest problem with this - continuity errors.  The best thing that I feel could happen from here is John Carpenter's original vision and plan for an anthology to happen rather than the old series about a mass serial killer.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis was good, convincing.  The whole movie was fairly plausible and could have stood on it's own without any prior knowledge of any of the other Halloween movies.  If any genre of movie can get away with heroine empowerment it's horror movies.  That brings me to another reason I decided to see this... \n\n... it really looks like Hollywood is completely forcing heterosexual white males out of the movie theaters.  I have three or four movies still on my radar for 2018 but they are all feminine led and I might skip out on all of them.  Most of 2019 doesn't look much better with straight white male alienation continuing.  So, if there is to be a last movie for me to see for awhile then it had to be this.\n\nIn the big picture against everything else this probably isn't a 7 of 10 movie but in what I consider a down year for movies there was nothing wrong enough for me to try and finagle it down to a 6 of 10.\n\n7 of 10",

Some parts got really repetitive and emotionless to the modern generation, but was definitely freaked out in the night-time sequence. Now when I watch this BETTER sequel, it was exactly what I had expected as a true fan who totally agrees with these film makers. It had better pacing and immediately got to the point and was emotional and intense the whole time. Heck with the jumpscare factors that plagued many 2010 movies. This film rocked it to where you would actually care about the characters. Even the soundtrack in my opinion was really well written and played by John. Will definitely buy on DVD and watch from time to time. This is the best and I mean the best slasher movie in 40 years.
