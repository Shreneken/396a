Also, its great cast is terribly wasted, is soundtrack is very out of place, its production is unremarkable, and its script is full with cringy jokes, baffling pop culture references and plot conveniences. It feels like a poor attempt at satirizing Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes movies and a lazy copy of Steve Martin's Pink Panther movies.

Every second of what I saw was so appallingly awful that it was literally unwatchable.  It's a slight slap in the face considering the fact that this came right after the tail-end of the absolutely brilliant 'Sherlock' series, quite possibly the most purely intellectual show of the past decade, and not too long after the passable if unexceptional Sherlock Holmes movies by Guy Ritchie, which were in themselves smarter than they might at first appear -- Now, those both did offer room for outright parody, but this just uses the characters and setting of Holms and Watson as a venire for the laziest and lowest-brow of humor.  It's tragic that John C Reilly, whom has shown to be a genuinely funny and likeably quirky talent, is tied up in this, as it's well below him, even moreso than Step Brothers.  Supposedly, this movie was offered to Netflix for ultra-cheap when it was completed, and Netflix said No, knowing that it wasn't worth the money to turn into a Netflix exclusive, and I have NO doubt that this could be true - it really is that laborious and unfunny.  Now, at the very least, I suppose I can't say that I'm outright insulted by this movie outside of how stupid it is; none of its content seemed to be mean-spirited or aggressive, but at the same time, watching paint dry isn't insulting either, and the drying paint is substantially less obnoxious.",

Ferrell and Reilly have a much better rapport in this than in Step Brothers or the awful Talladega Nights, and I'd even go so far as to say the portrayal of Holmes and Watson as characters is far more faithful to the books than all the other recent interpretations. Personally, I think it's utterly hilarious and I watch it again and again - a brilliant film. Come on you grumps, forget about looking cool and give it another go!",

Reilly) are assigned to investigate the perpetrator of Queen Victoria's (Pam Ferris) future death on the Titanic. The murderer is their housekeeper Mrs. Hudson (Kelly Macdonald), who is a descendant of Dr. Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes), but don't expect me to analyze her plan because the movie doesn't care. Holmes & Watson is nothing but a barrage of predictable slapstick, insultingly deadly sexual jokes and painful meandering Victorian versions of modern-day references. Not to mention, there's an out-of-the-blue song sequence written by Alan Menken, who probably cashed his big paycheck for a pension fund and must have been ashamed penning such garbage. As for pop culture references, we get numerous allusions to Donald Trump's America, mentions of Fourth Wave feminism, and a cameo from Billy Zane at the end. Speaking of, the most insulting anachronism of all, aside from the drunken telegram sexting and the selfie from the Queen, the RMS Titanic was constructed in 1908 and launched in 1912, several years after Victoria's death. Not only that, the ship sailed not in London but in Southampton, tens of miles away. I know it's pointless to rag on a movie with nothing but comedic anachronism, but the Titanic ship is intentionally part of the storyline, one set in the nineteenth century where most Sherlock Holmes stories take place. Holmes & Watson is not only a downfall for Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly's careers, but also an insult to history, Arthur Conan Doyle's legacy and comedic intelligence.

I don't really revel in seeing Holmes turned into a buffoon, but the whole movie is silly, many things are lampooned and this Holmes fits into this crazy world of topsy turvy idiocy just fine. It isn't meant to be a literary classic, it's funny and goofy, and spoofing, and for a laugh or two, it isn't bad. I give this flick one out of two thumbs up.

It literally does not get worse than this. I can find absolutely nothing redeeming about it... zilch, zero, nada. When this was released in theaters and the abysmal reviews started pouring in, I had hoped it would be bad in a good way, or maybe even \"so bad it's good\". Alas, it's just bad… BAD BAD BAD all the way down to its core. It's not silly or shocking or anything that might appeal to certain niche audiences, it's just dull and lifeless and staggeringly unfunny. I did not crack a smile even once, and it was everything I could do to make it all the way to the end. I even primed the pump with a few glasses of wine before viewing, thinking it would put me in a better frame of mind to enjoy it, but it was all for naught. I've had stomach flu that I've enjoyed more than this movie. The film was clearly trying to parody Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes films, and it's failure is beyond epic. It does not even rise to the level of stupid… to call this movie stupid would be an insult to stupid movies. Oftentimes, I appreciate and enjoy stupid movies, but this… this is a void of nothingness, the black hole of fun, the complete absence of entertainment. How the once fabulously hilarious Ferrell/Reilly collaboration has come to this, I will never understand - even their considerable comedic talents cannot polish this turd. This film is a cinematic abomination, an affront to all of the senses, a holocaust of humor. I beg you... spare yourself and do not see it.",

Will Ferrell is excellent, as are all his movie, and so is John C Reilly. People seriously need to learn to get over themselves and be able to laugh at this funny brainless humour. I do agree that it is not for everyone, but i seriously recommend that you check it out, it is A LOT better then the uptight critics give it credit for. My biggest hope is that it doesn't deter Will Ferrell from making these incredibly funny silly movies in the future.

Reilly is John Watson.  Moriarty wants to kill the queen, but that really doesn't come into play until about the halfway point.  I don't even really know where to begin with this mess.  I suppose that I knew something was rotten in Denmark when I learned that not even Netflix would buy the movie (seriously, look it up), and they pump out an Adam Sandler movie a year now.  I was groaning before the movie even started because I had a preconceived notion on what I was walking into.  I get no satisfaction in telling you that I was absolutely right.  I don't think anybody here can make excuses for being involved in this.  Every single person involved in this should know better, and they all deserve to get that talk from their parents: I'm not angry, I'm just very disappointed.  From talented actors like Ralph Finnes, Rebecca Hall and Kelly Macdonald, and even Ferrell and Reilly should be past roles like this at this point in their respective careers.  These aren't middle aged men anymore, they are both in their 50s, which is entirely too old to be playing these man-children.  Every joke gets stretched like chewing gum, and it is never enough to form any sort of story.  There are random anachronisms that never go anywhere that I guess are there to be funny, and they just keep hammering the same joke over and over... and over.  It's not on that same level as Disaster Movie or anything (because really, what is), but it's not all that far off.  I usually miss the end-of-the-year bad comedy that gets dumped in December as counter-programming to Oscar contenders.  This time around, my queue decided not to spare me.  They try to give a nod to Guy Ritchie's 2009 Sherlock with the slo-mo fighting, but they do it too often and incompetently for it to ever be funny.  There isn't even enough material here for a 6 minute SNL sketch, never mind a 90 minute feature.  It's not even a movie, it's just about 12 lame jokes that they keep punctuating until you're ready to throw something at the television.",

It's not even the worst thing Will Ferrell or John C. Reilly have put out. But it REALLY sticks in the craw for me in such a hateful manner. This movie fucked with the wrong loser.\n\nOh good God. There is no real plot here. Not that it mattered. No, this is a series of things that happen. Those things being two aging comedians screaming at each other like autistic children until someone yelled cut. The rough idea (I guess) was that someone REALLY wanted to satirize the Guy Ritchie directed Sherlock Holmes films with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. Aside from the fact this movie is almost a decade too late on that front, it ignores the fact that those movies already WERE action comedies that had no problem making fun of their own premise and ridiculous steampunk tone. You were in on the joke AND you still had an interesting story and great chemistry between the main leads. And if you wanted a more serious and cerebral modern take on the classic character, you had the BBC series to fill your time. The other idea that led to this disaster was the history between Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, which included cult favorites such as Talladega Nights and Step Brothers. And yeah that dynamic is there, buried beneath all the shit. There are a couple of jokes that work and Ferrell's English accent is not as terrible as one would assume.\n\nBut the rest is PAINFULLY unfunny. Aside from yelling all of their lines, overuse of the gag about Sherlock Holmes being able to calculate (or rather failing to calculate) the mathematics of a fight, jokes about how Watson REALLY wants to bang old Queen Victoria, there are numerous moments in which we are supposed to laugh at cocaine and heroin use. HEY GUYS! DID YOU KNOW THEY DID HARD DRUGS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND DIDN'T KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THEY WERE?! WIKIPEDIA SAID IT WAS IN THE BOOKS! PEOPLE IN OLDEN TIMES WERE SOOOOOO STUPID, UNLIKE NOW!!!\n\nI think there is one teachable moment in this dumpster fire. In one scene, Holmes and Watson visit the morgue. Watson asks the World's Greatest Detective if he will be queasy again at the sight of dead bodies. It was at this moment the horror of this joke dawned on me. They are going to make Sherlock Holmes into a stock Will Farrell character for the sake of an overlong vomit joke. Sure enough, he vomits uncontrollably for the next five minutes and can't even get past the lobby. He then flirts with a mute woman and Watson hits on a doctor while they perform an erotic autopsy. What I'm getting at here, is that good satire operates within the rules and world of the IP or topic they are deconstructing. Sherlock Holmes has pulled apart corpses and put them back together for fun. He has spent many a night in rooms FILLED WITH THEM. You are telling me that no comedic writer can get mileage out of THAT weird shit? By acknowledging the source material (and actually understanding it) you can properly take it apart for laughs. For good examples of this, see Mel Brooks' filmography, The LEGO Batman movie, and the first Austin Powers entry. Needless to say, this was where this movie pretty much died for me, long before we have Queen Victoria performing an opening ceremony on the Titanic so we can get a Billy Zane joke. (Yep. That happened.) Fuck this movie. And fuck the people that made it. Netflix didn't want this piece of shit. Think about that. They had no choice but to release it into theaters knowing it would bomb on all fronts. Perhaps the use of the Titanic was appropriate after all.",

So, we went, and we laughed, and we got the jokes, and we got the sarcasm, we even got the \"TRUMPed\" remark, and we laughed again. The easily offended may walk away with their noses in the air, but we got the humour, and we laughed again! Needless to say, we're still Ferrell, Reilly, Holmes and Watson fans! \n\nI must say, Ralph Fiennes plays his part so well! The accent he uses stunned me; I never expected that accent to come out of his mouth. I loved it! :D Well done, Mr Fiennes!\n\nAnd Kelly Macdonald!! Good call for Mrs Hudson. It was weird hearing her real accent, lol, but she was great, too!\n\nHugh Laurie, Pam Ferris, Rob Brydon, and Steve Coogan...

Will Farrell with so much makeup on they made him look gay, hysterical. Will Farrell doing a terrible over the top British accent, hysterical. The musical they break into ala Les Miserable, hysterical! My sister and I were laughing so hard I was crying. I haven’t done that in years. Bottom line this movie is hysterical. Ignore all the moronic negative reviews, many of which by the way authored by social justice warriors who didn’t appreciate the bullying scenes at the beginning. Hello? It’s the 1800’s! ANYONE THAT WASN’T WEALTHY WAS BULLIED! GO SEE THIS MOVIE. ITS OVER THE TOP HYSTERICAL.

Reilly. Silly, cringeworthy, disgusting at times, with some shock humour thrown in (namely the Titanic, Trump and Gun Control jokes!). It made us laugh the whole way through and we enjoyed the poking of fun at all the previous \"smart\" Sherlock and Watson characters.\n\nThere were some great cameos, and some good laugh out loud moments. \n\nNot recommended if you don't like low-brow humour, but if you are fans of these two and don't mind letting go and getting a little bit silly it's definitely well worth a watch.",

The theme music being vertually borrowed from the Robert Downey Jr. movies, and the excellent costuming helped. There were a few spots where the dubbing of Mrs. Hudson were quite noticible, but it being a comedy it didn't take me out of the story. There was a lot of laughing during the watching, but I feel few people were in the audience as the press got out ahead of the general audiences with negative spin.

Still, even if Holmes & Watson were to come out some eleven years ago it wouldn't have been directed by Adam McKay (the director of those aforementioned Ferrell and Reilly collaborations) and that is the chief issue with this rushed, lifeless,  excursion into a premise that never takes off; a skit that should have been cut not because of a lack of time, but because the premise wasn't near substantial enough to support the time it's given. \n\nAs someone who turned 16 in 2003 and already adored Ferrell due to his SNL performances it was like seeing the rest of the world discover what I already knew that year when he delivered the one-two punch of Old School and Elf (I realize the former wasn't immediately seen as a success, but it's long since become a cult favorite). In the years that followed, Ferrell would go on to become a comedy titan thanks in large part to his collaborations with McKay-each of which are exceptional in their own right-but if Holmes & Watson signifies anything it is the end of an era; the final nail in the coffin that began being built a few years back with the likes of Get Hard and Daddy's Home, and continued through to last year with The House and a Daddy's Home sequel. In 2009, something like Land of the Lost was the exception, not the rule, but Ferrell has turned such expectations on their head and now we expect nothing less than cheap comedy from a guy who was once the king of being smart and cutting by being dumb and funny. Ferrell isn't the only one who has fallen prey to this plague of unfunny-friends in his \"Frat Pack\" have also had an equally tough time adapting their comedy and careers to their age as Stiller made Zoolander 2, Vaughn and Owen Wilson re-teamed for The Internship, and who knows where Luke Wilson has been for the last decade, but Ferrell's fall-for one reason or another-hurts a little more. \n\nHolmes & Watson is not a good movie and considering how good we know Ferrell and John C. Reilly can be together Holmes & Watson is even more disappointing, but it's not the out and out atrocity that's causing hoardes of walk-outs either. It has less than a handful of inspired comedic moments in a script where the same joke is repeated scene after scene to the same degree of effectiveness: little to none. A musical number that should have gone bigger and a zinger of a cameo, both near the end of the film, are easily the best things writer/director Etan Cohen's film has to offer. So, is Holmes & Watson a good movie? No. Was I ever bored to the point I didn't continue to hold out hope things might get better? No, not until the end came and I realized hope for Ferrell might forever be lost. At least until he gets a little older and redeems himself critically with more serious-minded work only to then make a glorious return to comedy and is subsequently discovered by a new generation of fans where the likes of Holmes & Watson will have long been forgotten and is never brought up again.",

Some were even so bad it was good and that is the charm of loving bad movies. I am the man who has No Holds Barred in every format it was released in(including betamax). I go to horror movie screenings all the time. I go to Rocky Horror every year for Halloween as well as the showings of The Room when it plays in my area. I saw BOTH parts of Best F(r)iends on the day they were in theaters and loved them(Tommy Wiseau IS GOD!). Some of my favorite movies are ones that people consider ï¿ 1/2 1/2badï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â?.\n\nWhy am I mentioning all of this? \n\nBecause as an expert on bad movies, Iï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)m here to tell you that Holmes and Watson is by far, the WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! Iï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)ve seen thousands of movies in my 32 years, none have been as bad as this. There are no redeeming qualities at all. \n\nI was excited for this movie as I loved Step Brothers as well as both Anchorman movies and Elf. Will Ferrell movies are usually funny. This one was not. Itï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s like they got high one day and thought it would be funny to take a ï¿ 1/2 1/2Flintstonesï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â? approach to Sherlock Holmes and mix it with the crudest jokes they can imagine. \n\nThe jokes fall flat, the execution is all wrong, the script writing is terrible, and the actors give no meaning behind their performances. Itï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s like from scene to scene, they donï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)t know who they are supposed to be. Almost like they are making it up as they go along. It worked for Soap because Soap was actually funny and you had great improv comedy actors. This movie had none of that.\n\nI do have one badge of honor. It is my predilection for bad movies that allowed me to watch it the entire way through and not walk out like most who watched this movie. Yes, I did see people walking out when I watched it. But I never walked out of a movie all my life and this movie wasnï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)t going to break that cycle. I suffered all throughout but I didnï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)t quit. Because quitting is for losers and winners never quit. \n\nThank GOD I used this as one of my A-List selections so I didnï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)t really pay for it. If I did, you better believe I would have demanded a refund and sued the theater, Columbia Pictures, and everyone involved with making this atrocity for emotional distress.

This was the first Will Ferell and John C. Reilly movie I had seen. I thought the movie was so fricking hilarious. My mom and I were laughing our heads off the whole time l. I could feel the audience glaring at us, but I couldnï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t help it. This movie is amazing, I love it! My family loved watching the trailer for laughs and thought that because of all the bad reviews all the funny bits were in the trailer. We were expecting something very mediocre. Turns out this is one of my new favorite comedies. I definitely suggest this movie, contrary to belief. Can we PLEASE have a sequel. This movie is going to be like a ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2Itï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s a Wonderful Life,ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2? in a few years all the critics will see what a great piece of filmmaking this is and itï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)ll be famous and loved, just like it should be.

At times I wanted to gauge my eyes and plug my ears to this despicable nonsense movie. I have enjoyed other Will Ferrell movies in the past, so I was very disappointed at the obvious attempt at a cash grab. The jokes were repetitive, lazy, and at times painful to sit through. It seemed like instead of a plot,or any type of direction for that matter, Ferrell and John C Reilly were just trapped on a set and told to \"be funny\". If it weren't for the fact that I paid money to watch this movie I would have left, and in all honesty if you asked me to watch it for my money back I would rather just take the loss.",

Some were a bit obvious but none the less they were all funny. \n\nWhat happened to an easy sense of humour?\nWhat happened to puns and references to relevant media that we all chuckled at?\n\nWill Ferrel and John C Reilly(aka Dr.Brule) were brilliant in this rendition of Sherlock Holmes. As a British person I especially enjoyed their over accented fake accents and the play on old Victorian language they used. It was funny. It created comedy in itself. \nThe plot was simple and moved quickly, allowing for the pair to go about their adventure in a whimsical manner without too much focus on problem solving or anything too complicated. It was a plot made for old fashioned jokes. In their typical style, there was lots of shouting of humorous lines and strange facial expressions that could not fail but to make you giggle. The very well established role of will ferrel as an egotistical protagonist was not only maintained in the character of Sherlock but brilliantly juxtaposed by his faithful  friend Watson, who desperately sought Sherlockï¿ 1/2(TM)s approval.\n\nThe cameos in the film were a fun added extra for anyone who is a fan of such a thing, although I didnï¿ 1/2(TM)t find them particularly funny. They envoked a pleasant sense of familiarity and most definitely aided to the comedy, however  the duo led the way through the majority of the jokes.\n\nThe film was not perfect and it wasnï¿ 1/2(TM)t as belly achingly funny as step brothers, but MY GOD PEOPLE, chill out, be happy and open your mind to the film as being a couple of dudes doing some pretty silly jokes making for a hilarious hour and a half. Donï¿ 1/2(TM)t go in with expectations of a grandly comedic adaptation of the great Sherlock Holmes. No. It was definitely a mystery who the killer was, which is an important anecdote to make, but itï¿ 1/2(TM)s not meant to simulate Sherlock Holmes or your regular spoof. Itï¿ 1/2(TM)s a film and story all of its own, using the characters as a vehicle to create their own familiar spin comedy.\n\nGo to the cinema, download it, wait for it to come on Netflix or whatever you like, but give it a chance. \n\nRemember, itï¿ 1/2(TM)s a film full of jokes so sit back and try and have a laugh!",

The film currently sits at 6% on Rotten Tomatoes and at one point had the dreadful honour of being completely at 0%.\n\nWatching it confirms the fact that it is entirely rotten. Which is an absolute shame. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are comedy greats and usually together their humour is multiplied...but clearly the problem lies in the script and direction.\n\nBoth duties fall under Etan Cohen, not to be confused with Joel and Ethan Coen and definitely not to be confused with Joel Cohen, writer of Garfield. Of all the Coen/Cohen's in Hollywood, we've found our Paul W.S. Anderson equivalent.Â \n\nPreviously the filmmaker behind Ferrell vehicle Get Hard, it's amazing to see someone get worse, particularly this worse.Â \n\nHolmes and Watson has all the trappings of a Sherlock Holmes story and all the trappings of a potentially great comedy handled with the grace of the Running of the Bulls through the World's Largest China Shop. So inefficient and unfunny, it's definitely not great when you look around at the silence caused by the severe lack of jokes in the minutes before the opening credits (except one person in my screening, but there's always gonna be one intergalactic alien trying to fit in as a secret human).\n\nThe film is severely bland and lacking, full of choices that seem completely misguided. Ferrell decides to put on a strange accent for Holmes that doesn't work at all, and Reilly's Watson is overly and unfunnily violent, yet these are choices never dissuaded by the director, which is concerning.\n\nHolmes and Watson has a story, if you can believe that, one where Moriarty (played by the criminally underused and probably overpaid Ralph Fiennes) has a presence, but is harshly pushed to the side in favour of an invisible antagonist you can figure out by spoilers by billing.Â \n\nOn a completely unrelated note, Kelly MacDonald is in this movie and she continues to be brilliant and brilliantly Scottish in the things that she makes, and while her character is there for a bunch of anachronistic jokes and pushed to the side too, when her arc thins out it feels like it was a good idea made sour at the drop of a hat.\n\nSomewhere, in this movie, there is a joke. I guess. I hope. Much like A Million Ways to Die in the West and other films of that ilk, the only thing that made me laugh was a heavy reference to a much better film that had humour in the fact it took you completely out of the movie you were watching, because it's safer.\n\nHolmes and Watson is a hollow entry to round out the year of comedy movies. Alan Menken and Glenn Slater offer the second closest thing to a joke with an original song that's a parody of their work that's nothing compared to Vanelope's \"I want\" song parody in Ralph Breaks the Internet.Â \n\nEverything in this movie has been done better and bigger and funnier and smarter. Hell, even the overrated later episodes of BBC's Sherlock itself parodies itself better, even down to a drunk Sherlock scene that doesn't have to stoop so low as this movie does for an attempt of a laugh.\n\nIt joins a bunch of movies I would give no stars to if I could, but the sheer fact that somehow this movie made it from conception to the silver screen is some sort of commendation. Plus it has a Titanic joke that makes no sense, but it makes more sense than the entirety of the film.Â \n\nAnd before you say something, yes, the majority of jokes in this film are indeed out of time. And out of this world.\n\nWhich is not a good thing.Â \n\n1/5 Stars.\n\n- CJ",

Iâ(TM)m a pretty easy movie critic, maybe donâ(TM)t go see it if you are a movie snob or harsher critic, but otherwise I think the movie does what a comedy aims to do, and was suitably entertaining for the masses. Honestly the only reason I wrote this review, which is my first, was that I thought it was a bit unfair with how much bad press the movie was receiving...I didnâ(TM)t think it was half bad, at least not nearly as bad as critics made it out to be. And from what I could tell, the audience in my theatre at least seemed to generally feel the same, so it didnâ(TM)t seem to be just me who enjoyed it.",

Our group of six showed up to the theatre to find the movie we went to see was sold out. It was either Holmes and Watson or an animated Marvel movie.

They break all the rules on how white male landowners should conduct themselves by screaming at the top of their lungs for their female servant girl. The actress who plays the servant girl does a good job falling into the scene as she buttons up her gown and is followed around by whichever gent she was with when she was summoned by the unabashed crimes solvers. Then there is a American female doctor who has to prove herself to Holmes and Watson to be a doctor because there are no female Doctors in Victorian England. \n\nThere are plenty of drug references to make fun of Sherlock Holmes  penchant for chasing the dragon. There are plenty of phallic jokes and opportunities for the characters to call each other wankers.  a wanker. Dr. House makes a special appearance as Holmes telepathic brother. How could they put Dr. Watson in the back with the elephant man? Billy Zane makes a surprise appearance as himself and he impresses on other ship boarders the size of his canoe. Holmes and Watson save the Titanic from sinking before it left England's shores to, well... sink. Ralph Fiennes plays the imposter and the real Dr. Moriarty. At the end, Dr. Moriarty is hiding out in Wyoming, leaving room for a sequel of Holmes and Watson hunting Dr. Moriarty in the Wild West. They have to wear a good disguise. Handle bar mustache will suffice\n\nThere are enough light hearted quips about Trump and American politics to have a sequel set in the West. England gave us our freedom, we should at least have a good USA sequel. If Holmes and his wrongly convicted counterpart (Holmes almost sends Dr. Watson to the gallows) can't save the Queen's life (despite killing her, they do save her in the end) at least they have a chance to make England great!",

Its plot does not develop very rapidly, which has often been a major focus of the dry, humourless critics, however this slow development is clearly purposeful as it allows for more of the focus to fall upon the duo and their classic antics.\n\nI implore you to walk into the theatre expecting an obnoxious rendition of Sherlock Holmes aimed simply at entertaining, rather than stimulating your intellect. Because of this is what you expect out of this movie, I guarantee you will enjoy yourself!\n\nHope you manage to tune out all these dimwits and actually give this movie a try!",

It's this which stops Will from being a truly great actor like the off beat comedian of old Tom Hanks (believe it or not, see his early 80's work).\n\nSo, what is it, off beat american comedy applied over British comedy going too far.  British comedy works because they withstrain themselves, use tension on the joke, channel and direct themselves.  I was looking at a bit of the American comedy overlay in this, but Will trying to polish his succulent bitch vegetable, encouraging Watson to kill himself off handedly repeatedly and trying to pump the queen, are all classic examples of over reach, even Watson trying to hold the Queens hand, needy.  Take them away, and other parts of the dead Queen V incident, and yeah, it's better.  Put it this way, without those I could give it an extra star, or two.  I wouldn't mind seeing a second film a little toned down in more British style (British Comedy School, and then learn to play with that).  A new Cool Will 2.\n\nThe rest of the film, OK, a bit muddling in parts, three stars.  Appeals to certain people, and not to others (like reviews in here).

Holmes and Watson also threw in some political jokes which could have been funny if not for the horribly akward timing and anachronistic basis. (Minor Spoiler) While on the subject of horribly awkward timing, the uncomfortable musical number made little sense and, therefore, got little laughs.\n\nThat being said, there were a few funny moments in this monstrosity of a movie. (Minor Spoiler) In a scene where the Queen of England supposedly dies while taking a self photograph (selfie), Holmes and Watson struggle to hide her body, gaining genuine laughs through the use of slapstick. In addition to this moment, there are a few other good laughs in there albeit, not many.\n\nOverall, Holmes and Watson presents hackneyed humor and downright odd portrayals of the famous Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. By missing this movie, one misses absolutely nothing of importance, except for the bragging rights of saying one has made it through this thoroughly awful movie.",

It's not good, but I didn't think this was absolutely the worst movie of 2018. From Director Etan Cohen who last brought us Get Hard (2015) Holmes and Watson is a comedic take on Sherlock Holmes and his partner Watson. Sherlock Holmes (Will Ferrell) and John Watson (John C Reilly) have just solved their most recent case revolving around the evil Dr. Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes) when the Queen (Pam Ferris) hires the duo to figure out a mystery surrounding a note saying the Queen will die within the week. Holmes and Watson are on the case and along with an American doctor named Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall) and her bumbling assistant Millie (Lauren Lapkus) they work to solve the case. This is literally the nicest I could have been here about the plot. It's incredibly simply, silly and predictable. Ferrell and Reilly have the same great chemistry they usually have, but its hindered with the whole Holmes and Watson personas. I almost feel like this would have worked better as an original tale and not as it was based on previous material. The movie is actually funny at times. It's incredibly dumb and maybe coming in with no expectations helped. I laughed a bit and enjoyed it overall. It's not perfect, or even particularly good. It has some moments that are funny, but this is definitely just a rental at best don't waste your time on this one in the theaters.",

Reilly have excellent timing and really held the film together. Other reviewers on here have complained that the jokes were telegraphed as if that was a negative; I felt the fact that they were telegraphed made them all the funnier because we were in on the joke that these two were so clueless as to not realize what was going on. For example, when Holmes and Watson take turns slapping each other in the face to try to kill a mosquito. The timing is superb! With straight faces these guys slap away obvilious to the fact that they are becoming Moe and Larry Howard from the three stooges.\n\nOReilly's reaction to Holmes' \"disguise\" is uncommon in its sincerity. Watching Holmes create Watson's disguise is a hoot if you are not a stuffed shirt.\n\nSome of you maybe needed a cocktail to let down your walls. I predict this film will become a cult classic one day.\n\nIt's definitely closer to a 10. than a 1. A 1? Nuts! Sad 1 Star reviewers missed out on the fun.",

I wish Hollywood would stop being political and start making movies for entertainment again.  \n\nAll in all this movie SUCKS!",

Many likely have never even seen the film and are just ragging on it because they were told to. Southpark, Simpsons, comedy always has politics and the cultish sheep horde are just targeting this film because the troll farms told them to, or because they want to pretend to fit in.\n\nHolmes and Watson is your basic slapstick comedy that follows along with the style of a lot of films Will Farrell and John Reilly do. It's a bit like Step-Brothers and Talladega Nights. If you liked those movies then you will likely like this one.  The actors were let of the leash in this film and obviously had a lot of fun making it.\n\nHolmes and Watson is good for a laugh if you don't want to think and just want to have a snicker along with a film.

I went hoping to laugh at anything but this was total garbage.  The only semblance of humor to be had didn't even come from the leads in the movie but were often the product of sight gags.  The jokes were stale, mistimed, and weak.  There were jokes from items that had not be a pop-culture reference for nearly a decade.  In the middle of an already meaningless jumble of story, the movie even attempts to hop on a soapbox and claim some sort of political relevancy which can be humorous if done with a deft hand but this just came across as misplaced and pointless.  I believe the last straw for me was watching someone who has been in some of the funniest movies I have ever seen stalling out through an hour and fifteen minutes of runtime only to say, \"I swear that if he breaks out into song, I am out of here.\"  ...then he did.
