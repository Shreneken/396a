            "content": "Harry Potter and the goblet of fire is a very good moovie , it's my favorite moovie on the world. The realisator is Mike Newell and the leads actors are : Daniel Radclife ( harry potter ) , Ruper grint ( Ron weasley) and Emma Watson ( Hermione Granger ) . It was released the 30 november 2005. It s the story of harry potter who gone to hogward for his 4th year and it s the year where there is the goblet of fire . He is too young to participate and he don t want to because it s really dangerous. But no one know why but harry potter was registered to participate. In my opinion the actors are very good  when we see the moovie we really think that we are at hogward because the acting is so good. When we see the film we feel that the actors really lives at hogward. The soundtrack is really good it s all my childhood . The costume look like they really exist , that the hogward's magic really exist , it's the costume's power and the cinematographie let us fell that we are really to hogward ,  it's magic. The theme is wizard , not everyone can like it because it is a very special theme that not everyone can like. But the positive point is that you can escape the real world to go to a magic one whereas it is hard  to stop dreaming after the moovie. In my opinion it's the best moovie you can see in your whole life if you like fantastic moovies. I really recommand pepole to see these movie.",

And this is the first HP movie with a PG-13 rating. Mike Newell does a decent job in making this movie and could improve in the directory view. But nevertheless the golden trio always shine.",

Probably. \n\nThere is a lot of subject material to get through in this movie (37 chapters compared to 17, 18 and 22 in the first three films respectively) and it shows. The film is incredibly fast paced and a little jumpy. While the Triwizard Tournament is exciting, the quiet moments with the core 3 are lacking.\n\nThat being said, this is still a Harry Potter movie, and I could watch these films on a loop. The story is full of misdirection, exhilarating stakes and one of the best finales in the franchise. I find myself bawling my eyes out during/after the graveyard every time. \n\nThis movie raises the stakes and brings the world of Harry Potter to the next level. I love Harry's response to Hermione's question, \"Everything's going to change now, isn't it?\" He, like the audience, knows that there is no turning back now.\n\nBest Character: Fred and George Weasley\nBest Scene: The Graveyard\nBest Quote: \"Dark and difficult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy.\" - Albus Dumbledore\nBest Piece of Score: Harry in Winter\n\nAdditional Note: I needed more Sirius. \nAdditional Note 2: Dumbledore is so frustrating in this movie. He is aggressive, brash and not the calming force that he is supposed to be. He finally calms down in the dormitory scene, but for the most part, I found myself missing Richard Harris.",

            "content": "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an absolute spectacle. I am a huge sucker for tournaments in films and this hit every single note for me; intensity, stakes, creativity, it is all there.\n\nOur main cast is doing some of the best acting of the series, Daniel Radcliffe really raises his performance up a notch and establishes himself as the lead of the franchise. His acting is refined and mature and he does an excellent job portraying his emotions with not only his line delivery but his facial expressions and body language. He really broke through here and it was a joy to see. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were great, but they had a slight decrease in screentime and really were sidelined during this film. The introduction of Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory brings an interesting dynamic to the story, as Harry Potter has somewhat of an older brother figure to contend with. The relationship and chemistry between the two builds and brings some emotionally heavy scenes throughout.\n\nThere is constant action in this film; from the opening scenes of the Quidditch World Cup to the multiple rounds of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, there is always something happening, and it helps create a very steady pace throughout. Not only is there action, but there is also fantastic character development. All of our characters really start to come into their own through the struggles they all face throughout the film. Harry is the best he's ever been, and the new faces are great on screen. Alastor Moody is mysterious and quirky and is a great mentor to Harry.\n\nBut the greatest thing about this film is the sinster introduction of Lord Voldemort. His presence was lurking in the background of the entire series, but here he is reborn in a horrifying way. Ralph Feinnes is superb in his only 6 minutes of screen time, but it is enough to leave a lasting impression. The ending is perfect and sets the tone of the franchise going forward.\n\nWhile the cinematography and tone might be better in Prisoner of Azkaban, I cannot deny that this movie is better in almost every other aspect, which is why it gets a slight nod.\n\nScore: 89%\nVerdict: Excellent",

            "content": "Not one for the purists.  So Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has returned to Hogwarts for the fourth year of his wizarding education.  This year, the school is hosting the Triwizard Tournament, which is a dangerous and prestigious competition.  Two other visiting schools have champions to offer, but when Harry gets unexpectedly chosen as Hogwarts' unprecedented second champion, something must be amiss.  Now I have always regarded Goblet of Fire as my favorite book and least favorite movie.  I remember griping about how much the movie left out in comparison to the source material, and as I make my way back through this series, I tried to approach this movie with more of an open mind.  Well, years may have passed, but I still feel exactly the same way.  Now I'm not here to air grievances for these movies failing to include every plot point in the book.  On the contrary.  The third movie is probably my favorite of the entire series, and it leaves a lot of action on the pages, but it is all for the benefit of story flow.  I will even commend Goblet of Fire for cutting the entire house elf subplot, as you could only do that thread justice if you had a television format of storytelling.  What I will complain about is the choice to make cuts that come close to making this story not make narrative sense.  I'm not exaggerating much when I say that they get through the opening ten chapters of this story in about ten minutes.  It puts such a tight restraint on any potential flow this movie could build, and I don't feel like scenes in this are given any room to breathe.  The book takes its time to let situations unfold naturally, but this movie always feels like it is in a rush to get on to the next big moment.  Because of this, every character feels like they are trying to hastily progress the plot, and you stop buying that they are acting there in the moment.  It's almost as if the makers of this are reliant on the fact that you've read the book, so you are therefore willing to accept the shorthand this movie has to offer.  I am here to tell you that is poor filmmaking and storytelling.  Despite having many objections on how this got handled, this movie is not without its moments.  I think the scenes involving the dragons are pretty cool, and even though the CGI is a bit dated at this point, it is still put together in an exciting fashion.  I also think the teenage melodrama actually works more than it doesn't.  These are real fights that kids would have at this age, and the actors do a good job of selling it.  This movie feels like a bare minimum effort in comparison to the other films, and I think this book would work far better as a mini-series.",

Los personajes tanto principales como secundarios tienen un desarrollo mucho mayor, present\u00e1ndonos tanto sus habilidades como sus rencores, y para mi este es el sub arco m\u00e1s interesante de la misma; ya que vemos sus emociones, ya no son los tres protagonistas contra un mal mayor, son los tres en contra de sus inseguridades de la adolescencia, muy bien representado especialmente en Ron, ya que vemos su lado humano, no dejan de ser simples personas, con problemas \"normales\" como a quien llevar al baile (Que esa secuencia particularmente me parece fant\u00e1stica) ya que ah\u00ed podemos ver a flor de piel el mensaje de la pel\u00edcula que para mi es \"No Siempre podemos ser la mejor versi\u00f3n que todos esperan de nosotros\" representada especialmente en esa escena con nuestros 3 protagonistas de diferentes maneras. El Conflicto principal no deja de ser menor, ya que vemos a un Harry Potter con todas las habilidades presentadas en pel\u00edculas anteriores, una evoluci\u00f3n que da gusto ver, con un momento clim\u00e1tico muy bien desarrollado, el inicio de Voldemort, un personaje que junto a Harry vimos evolucionar en las 3 pel\u00edculas anteriores hasta conseguir su forma m\u00e1s poderosa. Para mi en esta pel\u00edcula realmente se presenta el mundo m\u00e1gico, ya sea en sus habitantes (La Escena Inicial) d\u00e1ndole m\u00e1s foco a los personajes secundarios de Hogwarts y con efectos especiales brutales, una pel\u00edcula que en su desarrollo te deja sorprendido.",

The story is the best from every sector. considered perfect The start of the battle, adventure, action that has come into play due to the fact that in this sector Hogwarts has organized a Triwizard tournament. Tourmemt and other magic schools are also participating. Each school will send a representative to compete in this magic tournament. The age of the participants must be at least 17 years old, although Harry is not yet. Reached the criteria, but he accidentally entered the competition. This creates a lot of turmoil because the life expectancy line that Dumbledore, Head Professor of Horgwarts, has a dash. There's no way a child under 17 can deceive, causing the whole school to think that Harry lied that he wasn't doing it, and Harry's best friend Ron became jealous because he thought Harry wanted to be a hero. That's a really crazy idea for me. It frustrates me a lot with Ron's stupidity, but it's understandable because it's Ron Lol, and it leaves Harry out of nowhere. I'm so sad.  Ron is seriously bipolar in this regard.\n\tI liked this part because I saw the development of the relationship of the 3 friends, the different stages they had to prepare. It gave me a lot of excitement, such as the amazing battle between Harry and the dragon. He fights with excitement. And the scene where you have to open the underwater crystal ball in order to hear the hint to understand because it's a hint from the mermaids that make it on land to not understand. It was a scene that was truly unthinkable. seeing many wonderful things The creatures in the magical world that I had imagined while reading. The effect is done very well. Many characters appear in this installment a lot or even Harry has used what he learned to compete. It's amazing how he remembered what he had learned, Lol.\n\tThe movie puts more pressure on the viewers with the final mission that viewers like me watch and become uncomfortable instead. because everyone was led into the maze There aren't any demons here, but what we do find is the fear in our minds of going in the unknown and unfamiliar places. Suffocation and the scene clashing with the resurrected Lord Voldemort. He was really scary but he killed my Cedric which was way too easy. The effects of this movie never really disappoint. Every scene is great, amazing blend of magic, horror, humor and comedy and it's extremely entertaining and darker than the previous films.\n\tIt's not a perfect movie. A lot of things were rushed and skipping the good ones made me still prefer the book. but for the time 157 minutes watched I'm not disappointed at all It's a very good time. I will definitely continue to watch it every year, I believe that. I recommend.",

It progressed from scene to scene with a smoothness that i find to be lacking in many movies adapted from books. The acting has noticeably improved from the first three, and the more adult feel to this one really drew me in. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this movie was the fact that it felt like a mix of genres. This episode contains loads of adventures and action and it is such deeply riveting and emotional ; beside , still have bombastic special effects and several images have you on the edge of your seat , including an amazing array of technical bizarre creatures , a breathtaking combat between Harry and a dragon , a rescue from sea deep of his friends and an exciting battle between Harry and the Dark Lord and his henchmen , the Death Eaters. The picture displays stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown adventures , blending wizardry , witchcraft , horror , humor and being extremely amusing and enjoyable . Darkest even than previous chapters ; it is more thrilling ,more dramatic , more touching and more exciting. Finally, I would like to recommend this movie for everyone to try and see. Everyone can see the friendship of their friends or even the love and sacrifice of parents or people who love us. A fight against injustice that everyone believes must be overcome with Harry as their only hope. The courage of a boy who must fight evil. By inside, he is afraid,  but with courage and encouragement and support from those around you  It gave him the strength to fight that darkness.",

The only thing I didn't like so much about the book, was the subplot about Hermione trying to help house elves. It was cute, but interfered too much with the dark overtones of the narratives. The film looks dazzling, especially the ballroom scene. Speaking of that scene, I adored that dress that Hermione was wearing, Emma Watson looked unrecognisable in that scene.Also the music by Patrick Doyle this time was beautiful. I don't think it's as dark as the book, and I wasn't too keen on some of the casting. Roger Lloyd Pack and David Tennant were fine in their roles as the Crouches, but their characters were changed significantly. I did wish they made Crouch's disappearance more mysterious, instead of giving it away, ruining the suspense that was quite compelling up to that scene. I am not too keen on Michael Gambon's Dumbledore, I just don't remember Dumbledore being violent as they made him. As I've said already, I much prefer Richard Harris as the character. I am also on the fence about Mad Eye Moody. Brendan Gleeson is a very talented actor, evident in films like In Bruges and The General. He looked the part, but his voice wasn't exactly what I had in mind for Moody. I have listened to the audio tapes by Stephen Fry, and I imagine Moody's voice as low and gravelly. Although Gleeson mostly succeeded with his role, I personally think he tried too hard. My brother also noted that he didn't like the execution of the three tasks. I didn't like the third task, and the other two were fine. I did think on a positive note that Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort was suitably scary, and with the exception of Dumbledore everyone else was well done. All in all, a flawed but quite engrossing film, that doesn't quite live up to the darkness of the book. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

Throw in the fact that the movie is also darker and murkier than the other entries, before and since, and the very mediocre performance by Robert Pattinson (already one of the most over-valued people in the industry).  The mystery element involving David Tennant's character, Harry Crouch Junior, is really the only thing of real interest beyond the end, but it never actually amounts to anything either, as the audience already knows that he's evil, and once he's found out, his story ends literally seconds later..  All in all, the movie isn't 'bad' by any means - it's just almost entirely meaningless in the grand scheme of things, and honestly, it's just self-indulgence that this movie was a solid hour longer than it needed to be.",

He makes the most out of the lengthy runtime here by excising a lot of the subplots in the novel in an extremely successful way as it allowed more time to be spent on the climactic finale than had been allotted in any of the previous 3 movies. There was more interaction between the characters and a highly appreciable increase in comedy. The actors had grown up quite a lot and were doing better in each iteration at showing their acting range, with Hermione a particular highlight in this one. Doyle acquitted himself remarkably well, with his film score on par with Williams's previous three and the CGI had improved drastically even with only a year's time passing. Best of all was the source material itself as the underdog sports genre is probably my #1 favorite and the finale here is probably the best in the entire series, both the graveyard part and the quasi-epilogue reveal. I think Cuaron misunderstood the intended audience for these as his priorities seemed rooted solely in quality filmmaking instead of entertaining a mostly-teenaged audience, a concept Newell is apparently an expert at. The only criticism I have is that I think they could've found a few minutes to devote to the Quidditch World Cup instead of skipping the entire thing as that was one of the best chapters in the book!",

            "content": "The non-so magical review from a muggle.\n\n Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a fantasy/adventure film directed by Mike Newell. It is based on J.K.Rowling's novel which was written in 2000 and carries the same name as the novel. It was released on November 23, 2005. It is as well the fourth part in the Harry Potter film series.\nLast Christmas, I saw this film and it was definitely one to remember. Just like past Harry Potter films this one didn't fail to amuse me. You could tell that this was filmed on a big-budget compared to the previous films of the series. To my mind I think this one offers a lot more than fantasy or adventure, it also gives you a lot of headspace to imagination. This piece of art surely left me astonished and filled with questions, wanting to watch the next part. \n\nAs for the plot of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, it includes the three main characters to be grown up, as they enter their fourth year of the School of Wizardry and Witchcraft: Hogwarts. It holds a fair amount of violence, since Harry Potter, the main character has to enter the prestigious Triwizard Tournament as a minor and face some dreadful challenges along the way of becoming a champion. Throughout the film, new characters came to light. Some added a romantic aspect to the film, whereas others did not. For the 14-year-old Harry Potter, he endures pressure a normal teenager cannot handle to confront his biggest nightmare. With the help of his dearest friends, Hermione and Ron, he doesn't fail to succeed in the period of the tournament. After all, this is the year students prepare for the Yule Ball and dare to ask female students as their date to the ball. Yet, the charming part of the film quickly ends there, as Harry Potter will live up to his title as \u2018The Boy Who Lived'. \nThe Harry Potter series is known to leave every person astounded who is into fiction and/or fantasy. As for me, it was always a surprising experience watching through these films, as you notice the characters growing up from a young child to an adult. There is no doubt that J.K. Rowling is by far one of the most influential writers in our century. Not only, did she write several successful books but stands as a role model for young children and women. With the apparent cliffhanger at the end of the first film, it will leave you wanting more and you will end up watching the next films that follows up on the previous one. \nPersonally, I am a lover of anything fictional, which is obvious why I am a fan of Harry Potter. Behind the success of these series, I suppose that watchers admire the films as they are not predicable as much as you think it would be. For instance, in this film, it gets quite dark quickly once you watch Harry get involved into life-or-death situations. Another example, is that Harry experiences tons of emotions in this film. As he goes through happy moments with his friends, he goes through the same amount of unknown moments and feelings. However, I must say that this is perhaps the most significant Harry Potter film so far. Mainly because, while I was watching this part of the series it felt like a mix of genres. Also, another example to why this film doesn't have a sole boring moment since it will keep introducing new characters throughout. For the Triwizard Tournament I mentioned earlier, there will be a ton of new, yet interesting characters added who bring a value to these films, which also was an enjoyable aspect. Lastly, this film was not excessively long but definitely long enough to tell the story. But there is one negative detail, that the films don't fully cover every single detail like the books do. So if you want to have a full understanding experience, I suggest you to also read the books so that you don't miss out on other details. \n\nClearly, this masterpiece will be a hard one to forget, as it will stick to you for a longer time. It is not something that you will be able to forget soon, as it so famous. I would recommend this film to anyone who might be interest in fantasy and fictional characters. Furthermore, it is important to watch them in chronological order, since every film leaves a cliffhanger at the end which follows up on the next one. Lastly, I hope you get lost into the imagination of the magical world of Harry Potter, just like I did.",

            "content": "Summary: \n\tThis movie marks an important cornerstone in the development of the Harry Potter universe with the return of the Dark Lord Voldemort. It is set in Hogwarts during the fourth year of school, when the Triwizard Tournament takes place. It is a traditionally a competition between the three prominent schools of magic including Hogwarts, Durmstrang and Beauxbatons. Prior to the competition, the Goblet of Fire selects three students from each school to participate in the contest. Harry is unexpectedly selected and forced to enter the competition by the Goblet of Fire with three other students even though he never put his in the cup and he is also underage. Later, it is found out that one of the Voldemort's underlings cast an advanced spell on the Goblet to deceive it of Harry's age. During the first three rounds of the contest, Harry and the other students have to complete many difficult tasks such as rescuing underwater and fighting dragons. The climax of this movie comes when the four students compete to get out of the maze, the last round of the contest. However, Voldemort, still in his feeble from between dead and alive, and his underlings are in there waiting for the four, eventually killing Cedric from Hogwarts. Harry, after that, is capture, and his blood extracted and used to rebuild Voldemort into a strong physical form. Harry then duels against the Dark Lord for his life. He barely escapes Voldemort and eventually brings Cedric's body back to campus with the knowledge that Voldemort has returned.\n\nAnalysis: \n\tThe important turn of events in this movie heralds major change development of the storyline and the journey of Harry Potter as the main hero in this series. Harry is now no longer inherently safe from Voldemort like before when Harry's blood was has the magic against the Dark Lord. Now, both share the same blood as he used his Voldemort used Harry's blood to revive himself. Harry no longer is protected and now susceptible. He is now more representative of real-life heroes, who actually have vulnerabilities, not inherently indestructible by enemies as Harry used to be earlier in the series. \n\tThis sharing of blood between Harry and Voldemort is also symbolistic of the struggles that real-life heroes have. It is like a connection across the dichotomy of good and evil, signaling the heroes also have their own evil side that they struggle against. \n\tFurthermore, when Harry's friend Ron turns against him, it further depicts Harry as a misunderstood hero. Ron estranged himself from Harry because Ron thinks that Harry intentionally enters himself into the contest for fame. However, later in the movie, Ron actually helps Harry to get through one of the dangerous rounds of the contest where the four students had to compete underwater. Ron's actions actually saved Harry's life. This part of the stories highlights the resilience of true friendship. No matter how significant the misunderstanding is, true friends will still help each other when in need and resolve the problem between them.\n\tThen when the four enter the last round of the tournament, the maze, Cedric encounters a minion of Voldemort, he is murdered by the killing curse. Then, Harry is captured by the other underlings of Voldemort. His arm is cut, and his blood collected to revive Voldemort. Harry has to duel against him for his life. He almost loses against the newly rejuvenated and strengthened Dark Lord. However, the souls of Harry's loved ones who were murdered by Voldemort appear from Voldemort's wand and give Harry's time to get to the Portkey to escape the maze. This scene demonstrates the theme of love's triumph over hate and evil. \n\nCritique: \n\tI love this movie and the whole Harry Potter series as a whole. There are, nonetheless, certain details that I think can be improved upon. The first one is rather a minor detail. It is when Dumbledore finds out the Goblet of Fire has chosen Harry as the fourth selectee to enter the tournament. The book says that Dumbledore \u2018calmly' asks Harry if he actually put his name into the Goblet. However, the corresponding scene in the movie portraits Dumbledore's asking as aggressive and intimidating when he grabs Harry's arms and shakes them while questioning him. This minor detail, although does not affect the structural integrity of the storyline, somehow momentarily breaks the usual portrayal of Dumbledore as a gathered and calm man without serving any significant purpose. \n\tThe second detail is when Harry is forced to enter the Tournament. J.K Rowling here could have better explained why it is that way, because the audience may have questions such as the following: Why is an underage forced to enter such a perilous contest even when he does not want to? Or Why can't/doesn't the administration do anything to keep Harry from the having to enter? Explanations to these questions can further strengthen the integral structure of the storyline. \n\tOverall, despite these small details that may be improved, I still give the movie 5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Year 4 sees Harry Potter return to Hogwarts and endure something never before done by a wizard of his age. The Triwizard tournament sees students from three different schools compete in a series of dangerous competitions in order to achieve eternal glory. When Harry's name appear from the the cup he must enter the tournament and compete in these dangerous events all while dealing with new aspects of his personal life.\n\nThis film sees the original cast return and all give great performances across the board. Danielle Radcliffe has one extremely good scene when he returns with Cedrics body, he really showed what he can do as an actor in that scene. We get a couple of key new additions in Cedric Diggory played by Robert Pattinson as well as Mad Eye Moody played by Brendan Gleason. But as we find out by the end of the film Mad Eye was actually Barty Crouch played by David Tennant. That really was extremely obvious, they do a really poor job hiding throughout the film and guessed it pretty early on. \n\nThe storytelling is extremely well done and wastes no time throughout the film, giving us an extremely fast paced film. It jumps right in with Harry and the gang heading to the quidditch World Cup, where death eaters appear and terrorize the event. Directly after that the film begins setting up the personal relationships between these characters and than it jumps right into the tournament. \n\nOur characters are entering a point in their life when puberty is beginning. This means that our characters begin to have feelings for one another while also dealing with some tension. This tension comes in the form of Ron, Ron is a jerk in this film and honestly just a really unlikeable character. I understand that these kids are going through a time in their lives when these situations can happen but Ron just completely changed. \n\nThe tone balance in this film was really off at times. They made this film a lot darker than the first three which makes sense considering that they are showing how dangerous this wizarding world can be, but that tone leaked into a lot of character scenes and just made it feel weird. Hermonie legitimately never looks happy and Ron is completely different. It made for some strange character scenes that didn't feel right.\n\nThe tournament was a lot of fun and shows us aspects of the wizarding world we hadn't seen before. Each trial is really fun and does a good job of showing the type of person Harry is. It shows how Harry is just this run of the mill kid that wants a normal life. It also shows how caring and heroic Harry is.\n\nFinally I have to talk about Voldemort played by Ralph Fiennes. This is are first real look at the dark lord and my oh my is he menacing. He is a good mix of psychotic and haunting as we see him toy with Harry but then become extremely intimidating right after. That entire sequence in the graveyard is great.\n\nOverall The Goblet of Fire is a great film. With a great cast, fun scenes and great storytelling, this film has a lot to enjoy. But in addition to that we get a really strange take on Ron's character as well as some weird tone balancing that make the film darker than it needed to be. \n\n8/10",

The lighting is more generic, as is the cinematography ... which leads to a less visually pleasing film. The introduction of the slight gray filter starts, and it always pisses me off when they suck the color out of such a vibrant world to try and convey a more grim tone when the narrative itself should support that. Alot of moments feel more mechanical and kinda ubrupt due to a lack of buildup and context. Harry seems alot more passive with Ron and Hermione, but then out of nowhere gets frustrated with them. Dumbledore isn't Dumbledore in this one, just a heads up. Sorry to get all negative, here are the positives! Voldemort's *ahem* was amazing and well done, as were all 3 trials! \n\nIt sounds like I hate this film ... but I dont, I just think its a step down from nearly every aspect of the last.

Goblet features the first of \"teenage drama\" between the main characters, and as a consequence we get limited time with our three heroes interacting/working together. Although they reunite by the end of the movie, you can't help but feel you missed something as the first three films focus closely on Harry, Ron, and Hermione together, and this one does not. Most of this movie is focused on the spectacle of the games, rather than moving the overarching good vs evil storyline forward. It makes up for this with an intense final 20 minutes featuring the biggest event in the series thus far- the return of Voldemort. Goblet of Fire feels like the last movie that maintains some sense of innocent fun, as the ending propels the story forward into the confrontation with Voldemort.",

Nine reels is a lot to put together and screening a three hour movie can be exhausting, especially when you're trying to write several term papers during the same week it is coming out. You see, I am a projectionist and getting this movie ready for a midnight show was part of my job. I realize that the fact that I was paid $14.50/hr to watch this movie on Wednesday night might give rise to feelings of jealousy among some, but I am currently wishing I could manage to get more than five hours of sleep sometime soon.\n\nAll that said I must say this was by far the greatest Harry Potter film so far. Although it was long, it did not drag on. It had a nice, tight feel to it. It progressed from scene to scene with a smoothness that I find to be lacking in many movies adapted from books. The acting has noticeably improved from the first three, and the more adult feel to this one really drew me in. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this movie was the fact that it felt like a mix of genres. It had an epic feel to it. After all it is about good v. evil and battling the dark wizards, etc. This movie,however, also felt like a high school movie. It had the issues of coming of age, which makes sense as the characters begin to mature. Ultimately it came off a lot more loyal to the book in theme than I think the last one did. (The first two, while loyal, I found to be relatively campy and childish.)\n\nThis movie, like many, does have its shortfalls. I believe that Dumbledore was portrayed as a little too intense, like an old Al Pacino. Instead of the benevolent, kind, and good-humored old man I have always loved in the books. As someone that has read the books, I must say another shortfall is that this movie banks on familiarity with the story. Having read the books, I found it very easy to follow, but I could understand how one who has not read the books may feel a bit lost, as some important information was left out and some back-story was left mostly unexplained.\n\nAll in all I would say this is definitely the best movie in this series so far, and if the next three are on par with this one then I would be content.",

            "content": "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, directed by Mike Newell, is one of the most entertaining installments of the saga, but had a tough time finding it's place. Right off the bat, I didn't like the idea of him directing this film because, he was too lazy to watch the other Harry Potter films, or to even read The Goblet of Fire. Mike Newell brings his own style to the film, which is completely fine, but his execution fell short, feeling like he was working against the former directors, instead of working with them.\n\nMike Newell finds a way to incorporate a few decent ideas, with a handful of entertaining sequences, and great stakes, but the film as a whole, feels unconnected, with a lot of unnecessary filler, and subplots, that doesn't offer a whole lot to the film or saga, and could've easily been cut to develop more important events. On more than a few occasions, Newell started to craft a decent idea, and then he'll bail on it, and it became quite annoying. The pacing moves pretty fast through everything, leaving some things underdeveloped, and not that interesting, at times. The tones of the film play along the same lines as Prisoner of Azkaban, but turning up the darkness and comedy a level or two. The tones were fine for the most part, but Newell wanted this to be more of a comedy than all the others, and it feels forceful at times.\n\nAlthough this is still a story-based narrative, the characters had a lot to do. There was some nice moments from our returning supportive characters, while there was great tention from our three returning leads. There was a lot of nice maturing aspects to our leads, but it throws off the focus of the film, making it feel like two different films at times. Although there were some decent character moments with our returning characters, the abundance of new additions were almost completely disposable! There were a select few that belong in the narrative, but eighty percent of them have about two lines of dialogue, being utterly underutilized.\n\nThe screenplay by Steve Kloves had a lot of standout moments! He incorporated a lot of mature themes and messages, beautifully delivered by the cast! The issues with the screenplay, is the inconsistencies, and imbalances, due to an overstuffed narrative.\n\nThe production of this film looks great! The creative team used a lot of beautifully detailed set pieces, to really make the scenes pop! The cinematography looks fantastic, utilizing a lot of blues and greens, to really set the tone.\n\nThe Goblet of Fire really brings the magic element to new heights! With there being so many memorable action and magic sequences, the creative team still managed to balance it well, so it doesn't over saturate the message and themes they were going for. The effects also look phenomenal, still holding up til this day! It's a pleasure to be able to witness the big steps they take with each film, and seeing them come into their own.\n\nOverall, if I had a favorites list, Goblet of Fire is definitely in my top 3, but due to a lot inconsistencies, it's hard not to keep this one out of the bottom three.",

This a solid script that was adapted from one of the longest books in the series, Steve Kloves seems to have really put some thought into it because it made take a one movie break. As many people have pointed out, this series and the characters are all growing, learning, and maturing as they rediscover themselves and this film handles the awkwardness of teenagers pretty well and finds ways to relate this magical world to real-life which I found to be thoughtful filmmaking. Robert Pattinson makes his big-screen debut with a performance that shows he has potential, it's just a shame it was wasted on Twilight. Brendan Gleeson was very good as the ever-eccentric Moody, he gave some good comedy relief and had a such a character twist there at the end. The tri-wizard tournament itself was very intense and felt like it had consequences, it affects our hero and causes him to grow up real fast. The graveyard duel is awesome, it is very dark but that's what this film needed, Voldemort return is very menacing and he is shown as a major threat from the very beginning which sets the stakes really high and a great actor like Ralph Fiennes just elevates that to a level of great villainy that his reputation from the last films foretells. It is painfully clear to me that both Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are both better actors than Daniel Radcliffe, I just didn't get emotionally invested with his performance like it wanted me to. There are a few too many exposition dumps and Radcliffe's performance was a little shotty to me sometimes, John Williams score is sorely missed, this film also needed to be about 10-15 minutes longer than it is because it feels like there are a few chunks of the story missing, they needed to include other characters such as Ludo Bagman. Despite the issues, I actually enjoyed re-watching this film more than I thought I would, it is entertaining enough, most of the performances were great, the character building was well done once again, and the ending is very dark and ominous, it eludes to a future with Voldemort ruling in terror and it is a set up for the direction that the last half of movies go. This is about as good as Chamber of Secrets for me and I can't wait to re-watch it again someday soon.",

Additionally irrelevant plot details were given undue attention, whereas those perhaps most important were rewritten or just omitted due to having directed all of the attention in the wrong areas. Of course it would have helped a great deal if Newell had actually read the book with any degree of care and attention, as he admitted he had not prior to starting production, but in particular Dumbledore's character assassination is one thing that I, along with millions of other HP fans, will never forgive director Newell. When you adapt written word to the screen, big or small, you MUST pay due respect to that source material, otherwise you are simply displaying apathy towards the fans, and essentially presenting the notion that you think that you're above the author in some way, and that is the big mistake director Mike Newell made in this film. It isn't all doom and gloom though, performances al around (even from Gambon) were very strong, Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter is absolutely sensational, and Brendan Gleeson as Moody was another perfect cast. The narrative is far too episodic comparative to the fluidity of the previous three films, however as stated earlier the visual effects, the dragon in particular, were utterly fabulous. From an objective point of view, this is a good film, however in consideration of how much it strayed from the source material, and as a fan of said books, it falls flat in comparison with most of the other entries in the series.",

We are introduced to many new things in this movie like the quidditch world cup, a cool tournament, and Voldemort. Yet this film focuses too much on flash instead of substance.\n\nThere are some undeniably cool scenes, but they make no sense once revisited upon second thought. How are the death eaters able to attack a WORLD tournament so easily, especially when EVERYONE is armed with a potentially lethal weapon? How come we haven't been introduced to other schools before and how come we never hear from them again? Also, why TF should anyone care about Cedric? He has never been introduced to the series before.\n\nI appreciate that this film is the first of the series to receive a PG-13 rating and has darker themes than previous movies. Yet, the love stops there. It felt more like a self-service for fanboys/girls and nothing more. This film by itself cannot be a good standalone movie.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the awkward \"love\" scenes that this film tries to incorporate in it. Felt forced and was bleugh.\n\n1.5/5.

All the teen romance drama bits slow down this picture a great deal as it all seems paltry compared to the looming threat of violence. Goblet of Fire is exciting and endearing, so I can forgive its faults.\n\nJ. K. Rowling's writing is excellent for how she weaves a wizard tournament around the impending arrival of Harry Potter's main villain, played by a scene stealing Ralph Fiennes. He nails the creepy malice and sudden violent potential of Lord Voldemort. \n\nRoger Pratt's cinematography is beautiful during the water segments, horror bits, as well as all the teen drama, but his wide shots during dragon fight is awkward and misses the action. I wish shaky camera shots would go away as they ruin some moments early on, but many wide shots are striking the first port key teleportation or the dance. \n\nPatrick Doyle composes a fine, but forgettable score that doesn't compare to John Williams iconic Harry Potter music. Jany Temime and David Crossman's costumes are beautiful and playful, especially for the French witches arriving at Hogwarts.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe is excellent as a torn Harry Potter between the girls he likes and winning a contest he never entered. Rupert Grint is obnoxious as Ron Weasley in Goblet of Fire as his jealousy of Harry feels vaguely out of character and only could be the result of Rowling wanting his character to age into an angsty teenager. Emma Watson is devastating as a hurt Hermione Granger with her sort of toxic crush on Ron. Her dramatic acting during the ball is excellent and it's nice to see her so encouraging of Harry throughout this whole film.\n\nMichael Gambon plays Albus Dumbledore so strangely in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. His shouting at Harry once he realizes Harry's name was put into the Goblet of Fire feels very out of character. He doesn't feel as warm or kind as Richard Harris' Dumbledore at all. I like many of his unique choices, but not so much this time around. \n\nAlan Rickman is funny and cool as Snape, but still gets little to do. Robbie Coltrane is very funny flirting with Frances de la Tour. Brendan Gleeson is outright amazing as Mad Eye Moody. He transforms his whole appearance, with help from Eithn\u00e9 Fennel and Belinda Hodson's make-up, into a fearsome and fun character. His walking changes to limping as he puts a sneer on his face and is very expressive with what he's given. Gary Oldman gets a cameo as Sirius Black and that's about it. Robert Pattison is excellent as the kind and brave Cedric Diggory. Jeff Rawle delivers an amazing display of grief at the end of Goblet of Fire that you just have to see!\n\nCl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy is stunning as the graceful and poise Fleur Delacour. Stanislav Yanevski is forgettable as Victor Krum. Miranda Richardson is very funny and memorable as the annoying tabloid witch Rita Skeeter.\n\nMaggie Smith is really fun to watch as Minerva McGonagall as usual. Geraldine Sommerville is nice to see again as Lily Potter alongside Adrian Rawlins' James Potter. Tom Felton gets next to nothing to do as Draco Malfoy this time, whereas Jason Isaacs is excellent again as the arrogant Lucius Malfoy. Timothy Spall is fantastic as Wormtail. David Tennant is excellent and memorable as Barty Crouch Junior. James and Oliver Phelps are hilarious as Fred and George Weasley.\n\nI loved seeing Bonnie Wright again as Ginny Weasley because she's so cute and sweet. I wish she got more screen time with Daniel Radcliffe to build their relationship together as Ginny and Harry, but I digress. I like Katie Leung as Cho Chang, but I fail to see the point of having Cho be the love interest when they could have used Goblet of Fire as the first film to really develop Ginny and Harry's relationship naturally.\n\nIn all, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an excellent coming of age movie for teenagers and a thrilling dark fantasy picture for entire families to enjoy.",

I know everyone's main issue with this film is that the infamous Dumbledore line \"did u put your name in the goblet\"? Was shouted at Harry while in the book it was meant to be said calmly. As coming from my favourite book, that moment was a bit wired to see, but the more I watch this film, the more that scene doesn't bother me. I love the whole tri-wizard tournament, definitely the best parts of the film by a mile.... but what lets it down for me is the acting from Emma Watson, it seems abit off and when comparing to the other films, this is probably her weakest performance overall.

The things I didn't like however are things I really didn't like. The ball scene I thought was pointless, Ron acted like a massive baby almost the whole movie, and it felt like they where trying to hit at so many possible relationships to be explored in later films most notably Harry and Hermione and Harry and Cho but neither of those two things happened. Overall this is still enjoyable but definitely is the worst of the series for sure.",

            "content": "Strengths: Prisoner of Azkaban was darker than the first two installments, but it was here that the series moved into a more adult style, which was for the better. As the three leads moved into adolescence, they get a lot more to work with and all three actors deliver. Visually, I love everything about this film. It looks fantastic, while also maintaining the dark tone it needs. The Triwizard Tournament makes for a great concept to adapt to film. All three challenges allow for great scenes filled with tension. Harry's battle with the dragon is exhilarating, while the underwater scenes look great and are filled with danger. The Yule Ball also gave us a lighthearted time out, with some quality character moments. Robert Pattinson (Cedric) was better here than all the Twilight films. You really felt for his death. Speaking of, that was one of the most well done scenes in the franchise. It was so sudden, yet still sad. It had the desired effect. The return of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) was also a great scene. It really signaled the tonal shift in the movies and set the stage for a thrilling final four films. Throw in good stuff  from Michael Gambon (Dumbledore), David Tennant (Barty Crouch Jr.), and the visitors from the other schools, and you've got a slew of great performances.\n\nWeaknesses: I honestly can't find many flaws with this film. I wasn't a big fan of adding a tick for Crouch Jr.'s character. I know why it was done, but it took away from the big reveal near the end. As a reader of the book, there could've been more done with Rita Skeeter. She was more prominent in the books and if she wasn't going to play a similar role in the movie, they probably should've just cut her character as a whole.  \n\nOverall: It's the best Harry Potter film. I raved about it already, yet I still left a bunch out. It's faithful enough to the book to satisfy those fans, while also delivering a great movie if you're unfamiliar with the series. The grown up performances by the leads, the fantastic special effects, and the scenes involving the Triwizard Tournament and Voldemort were all tremendous. Stellar.",

            "content": "First, a confession: I am not, by any stretch of the imagination, a Potter fan, so I felt something of a fraud as I sneaked into a media screening of Goblet of Fire while many bona fide devotees have had to wait it out.\n\nMy interest in the franchise has thus far consisted of sitting through the first film in a freezing cinema wondering what all the fuss was about, and skim-reading the second book on an aeroplane to appease my curiosity as to the young wizard's appeal. I have long been astonished at the sheer scale of Rowling's achievement, and while I may treat many of my fellow commuters - the regressive thirty-somethings who are buried in her CHILDREN'S novels on the tube - with something approaching contempt, I realise her success is very much deserved. It's a bit excessive though, and frankly enough to reduce any impoverished wannabe writer to a jealous whimper.\n\nBeing an outsider who will undoubtedly get all the names wrong, I won't spend long here on the plot, save to say it revolves around the \"tri-wizard tournament\" - an epic and dangerous event that threatens to split Hogwarts loyalties asunder.\n\nInstead, I'll concentrate on the performances, and, first up, I fear I must say I have reservations over the casting of Harry. Daniel Radcliffe looked an inspired choice after the first film - floppy hair and specs and an earnest charm - but I'm afraid to say, he is an ordinary actor. The trouble with hiring an eleven year old for a film project as massive as this, is you are rather in the lap of the gods when it comes to puberty. It's a bit like doting on a baby puppy and then being terribly upset a year or so later when a bloody great Alsatian smashes up your living room and defecates on your carpet.\n\nMuch better are his faithful chums. Rubber-faced Ron (Rupert Grint) handles the adolescent grunting with considerably more aplomb than Radcliffe, and he also says \"bloody hell\" a lot which elicited gasps of delight from some of the younger viewers around me. There is some nice chemistry between him and the hitherto gawky and posh Hermione who has blossomed into a snooty English rose, and the theme of teenage angst runs deep throughout the excellent supporting cast.\n\n\"Dark and difficult times lie ahead\" is the smartly worded tagline, and one gets the impression Harry is far more comfortable dodging fire-breathing dragons, than he is tiptoeing around the opposite sex. The growing pains are neatly handled by director Mike Newell, himself no stranger to the awkward whimsy of love's young dream after sterling work on Four Weddings and a Funeral - Indeed, many of the light-hearted interludes around the school dance scenes betray Newell's penchant for bittersweet comedy and romantic pratfalls.\n\nAnd, of course, the adults in the cast zoom around with a zest inspired by their youthful co-stars. Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid fashions an unlikely romance with a giantess played by Frances De La Tour; Michael Gambon is a sprightly Dumbledore; and Gary Oldman's screen time is restricted to one scene where he thrusts his head through the burning coals of a roaring fire to offer Harry some sage advice. Perhaps they should have simply hired a stunt double and saved on his fee.\n\nMost impressive of all is Ralph Fiennes who is genuinely terrifying as the evil Lord Voldemort. Fiennes is ably assisted in his wickedness by a suitably conniving Timothy Spall and also the most fearsome set of nostrils to grace the silver screen since Hannibal Lector flexed his snout at Agent Starling in The Silence of the Lambs.\n\nIt is pretty stirring stuff - visually extraordinary in places - and nicely paced. Potterfiles will love it and detractors may just find their criticisms stuck in their throats. However, my disdain for adults who proudly devour the novels on public transport without any sense of shame remains absolute.Based on one of the best books of the Harry Potter series, the film adaptation of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet' had a lot to live up to and I think it succeeded. As Potter fans will know, in GoF, Harry is now fourteen and in his Fourth Year at Hogwarts. When an ancient tournament between Hogwarts and two other European wizarding schools is held that year, a Seventh Year contestant is chosen from each school to compete but things go dramatically awry when Harry, three years too young to even be entered in the dangerous and challenging tournament, is somehow also chosen after his name is mysteriously nominated. GoF is a sharp turning point in the books as the tone darkens considerably and the characters themselves change from being rather wide-eyed innocent children to adolescents thrust the turbulent, uncertain adult world where being 'good' or even an innocent will not guarantee your survival. This shift is also reflected in the film, which was rated 12A (PG13 for Americans), the first of the HP films to be rated so high.\n\nI have to say I did enjoy this film, although Prisoner of Azkaban remains my favourite of the four. Unlike the first two films, this did not attempt to condescend as much to small children in the audience. The tasks of the Triwizard tournament captured most of the thrills of the book, particularly the second water-based task where the merpeople were suitably creepy (now we know why none of the kids go swimming in the summer term!), but the first task over-ran for a minute or two more than needed. Light romance was touched upon yet wasn't over-emphasised and the Yule Ball will please those who enjoyed the scenes in the book but audience members over the age of sixteen might find teens ogling each other a tad dull (Hermione is very out-of-character and the scene does drag).\n\nThe acting of the adult cast is, of course, exemplary as always. Alan Rickman's Snape may only have had four or so scenes but he definitely made his presences known while Maggie Smith really captured the essence of McGonagall. Many people do miss Richard Harris' Dumbledore but I found that Michael Gambon has done an excellent job of moulding the role to make it his own. In GoF, Dumbledore feels very human in the way he carries the weight of the wizarding world on his shoulders and though he struggles at times, his concern for his pupils is paramount. I finally felt the close rapport between Dumbledore and Harry in this film that was missing in the previous three HP flicks. However, the prize has to go to Brendan Gleeson for his scene-stealing depiction of Mad-Eye Moody. Gleeson clearly enjoyed illustrating Moody's dangerous, feral edge.\n\nThe younger cast have also grown into their roles, improving from their previous outing. Rupert Grint, usually used to playing a comical and stupid Ron, had the chance to cut his acting teeth and show Ron's darker, bitter side and he did well. The Phelp twins have also improved dramatically. No longer do they come across as wooden cut-outs just reading from a cue-card and instead they are able to show the mischievous spontaneity of the Weasley twins. And I look forward to seeing more of Matthew Lewis, who was great at showing Neville's sensitive side without making him too klutzy. Out of the younger cast, though, Dan Radcliffe is the one who has progressed the most. In PoA, he was awful in the 'he was their friend' scene so he seems like another boy in the harrowing graveyard scene and the aftermath, depicting Harry's anger, feelings of vulnerability and grief. He still stumbled on occasion in other scenes but I, at last, have faith he might be able to do the Harry of 'Order of the Phoenix' justice when the time comes.\n\nThe film did lose points on a few issues. Although most of the young cast have expanded their acting skills as they have gone on, Emma Watson is waning. She has a tendency of over-enunciating her lines and being too melodramatic, which worked in 'The Philosopher's Stone' when Hermione was condescending and childishly bossy, but is just annoying by this point. She spent most of the film sounding as if she was on the verge of tears or in a hormonal snit, even in scenes which were not remotely sad or upsetting. There was also a choppy feel to the film, as if Steve Kloves struggled to properly condense the book into a two-hour film. Those who haven't read the books will have missed quite a bit and those who have read the books will feel the film is very rushed. Molly Weasley and the Dursleys were also missed, especially since I think Julie Walters would have been exceptional in the Molly/Harry interactions that take place aftermath of the graveyard scenes of the novel as the film didn't round off in a manner that reflected a boy had died and Harry would be traumatised by what he saw.\n\nI think most Potter fans will enjoy this although they will remark that it could have been better. Non-fans will also get something from this film as I imagine it is hard not to be captivated by the many action and dramatic events but they may find themselves muddled by the story. I would recommend that parents of young children either keep away or, at the very least, check out the film firstly before deciding if their child is old enough to cope with it. When I went to see it, there was a small lad of four or five being dragged along and in the middle of a particularly fearsome incident, the silence of the moment was cut by a wee voice crying, 'Mummy, I'm scared' so, parents, be warned.Before I review the film, let me start off by saying that I am a fan of the Harry Potter films and have liked all of them up to this point. I'm not going to compare the movie to the book because, as most people know, they are two completely different animals. There is no way in heaven, hell or on God's green Earth that a book the size of Goblet of Fire could appropriate EVERYTHING that happened in the novel. I'm going to go by what I saw up on the screen.\n\nWhat I saw up on the screen was a completely pedestrian effort that made no attempt at contributing style, substance, or character development to a series that was getting better and better with each progressive film. Scenes start and stop with no explanation. The big action scenes (especially the fight with the dragon) just begin with no buildup whatsoever almost as if you've stumbled upon someone playing the new Harry Potter video game. There is no sense of the passage of time at all. The Tri-Wizard tournament consists of only three challenges yet the competition seems to last the entire school year. Ron and Hermione have a blow-up at the Yule Ball because of his misplaced jealousy yet six months go by (the last day of school) and NOTHING MORE is ever said about it? She even tells him that he made a mistake by not asking her out and he lets SIX MORE MONTHS go by without saying a word?!\n\nI can forgive the fact that a lot of these things are just glossed over because of the time crunch but I can not forgive situation after situation that has something happen only because the lead character needs to live. In the aforementioned fight with the dragon, Harry ends up hanging from a ledge 100 stories above the ground trying to reach his broom which is nearby. The dragon lands on the building and begins crawling down to him, slipping and sliding, peeling away shingles as it goes and it suddenly hit me. Harry is hanging from a ledge, defenseless, and the dragon is CRAWLING toward him. He is dealing with a creature who spits fire and who can FLY. One flap of its wings and a quick belch and Harry is crispy. The ONLY reason it doesn't is because Harry has to live. \n\nAnd for that matter, no one in the film acts or reacts to a situation because it's in their nature to do so. They react in a certain way because that's what the script demands that they do, even if it completely goes against their character and everything that we know about them. When Hermione blows up at Ron, it seems to come out of nowhere. She seems to be mad because Ron didn't ask her and she wanted to go with him. But if this is true, why is she so happy about being there with a competitor from a rival school? And I don't just mean happy, I mean she is absolutely BEAMING when she arrives with him. And at one point, Dumbledore grabs Harry and shakes him violently demanding that he answer a question. My reaction to that was WTF??? Has Dumbledore ever shown that he's a violent person or that he would grab a STUDENT, yelling in his face? Of course not but he does it because the script says he has to. At one point in the film, a particular curse is brought up that allows you to control another being. That's kind of funny because it seems like every character in this film is being controlled by the screenplay, even if it means going completely against character.\n\nBut I guess the biggest disappointment for me was the confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. For someone who has been built up to be the devil, he sure is beaten easily at the end of this film (and by a quartet of ghosts, no less, which took cheesiness to a new level). The appearance of Voldemort is obviously supposed to be chilling but, in actuality, he looks like a hairless rat wearing a cape. The great Ralph Fiennes does everything he can but part of the appeal of this character is NOT seeing him in closeup in full daylight. He shows up when he wants and manages to let Harry live because he'd rather talk him to death instead of just cutting off his head while Harry is pinned down. But, of course, that's because Harry has to live and this final confrontation, again, seems ridiculous in retrospect.\n\nThe entire Tri-Wizard tournament seemed a little off-kilter to me. You perform tasks that test your abilities and try to do better than your opponents, but to what end? The final test consists of entering an ever-changing maze and the first competitor to find the trophy wins the tournament. So, even if you finish DEAD LAST in every other challenge, if you're the first to find the trophy, you win anyway. So, I ask you, WHAT'S THE FRIGGIN' POINT OF EVEN COMPETING IN THE OTHER CHALLENGES?????? Why put yourself in harm's way three times when you only HAVE to do it once? \n\nLooking back, I just realized that you could completely skip this film and move right on to number five without missing a beat as long as you had someone to tell you two things about the film - Harry's interest in Cho and Voldemort being back, sort of. Here's hoping Order of the Phoenix doesn't follow the same path.",

            "content": "The turn in the franchise that finally pushes the Harry Potter movies forward, filled with much more darkness, a little more comedy, and a lot more tragedy. \n\nHarry is introduced to yet another Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher: the grizzled Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), a former dark wizard catcher who agreed to take on the infamous \"DADA\" professorship as a personal favor to Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). Of course, Harry's wishes for an uneventful school year are almost immediately shattered when he is unexpectedly chosen, along with fellow student Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson), as Hogwarts' representative in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, which awards whoever completes three magical tasks the most skillfully with a thousand-galleon purse and the admiration of the international wizard community.\n\nWithout question, I think this film is the best film in the franchise up to this date. It's easily the darkest, it has the most magic we've ever seen till now, it has deeper character development, it has a little more comedy, and it's just even more crazy. Without a doubt, it's one of my personal favorites in the entire series, which is saying a lot considering how good all the movies have been till this point. \n\nOne of the best things about this film is just how dark and emotional it is. This is the first PG-13 film in the franchise, and they really take advantage of that. This feels like the film that finally immerses you into the lore of Voldemort. From the very first scene, they establish the tone of what this film is going to be. It's much darker and more serious, showing us that the stakes are a lot more higher than we could ever imagine. The film is also simultaneously emotional, with a very impactful ending. It was a tragic ending and a perfect way to end this film. It ends on a question mark and a darker note, making us excited for what's next. \n\nI think that this film easily looks the best of the first four films. Granted, I feel like that's an obvious, but this easily is the most least dated movie till this point. Did that make sense? Probably not, but you get what I mean. The CGI and the sets look amazing in this film. The monotone and color pallet used suggests a much more darker and grim film. The camera work and the elaborate angles help tell a story through its visuals, which makes it even more impactful. I think this film looks amazing and it definitely deserves praise in that department. \n\nWith our main protagonists, I think this is also the point where you not only see them transition as older kids, but their acting also evolves a lot in this film. You can see their acting skills and how they've grown throughout the year. They're kids, but they act like they're older. Our characters also go through the same problems that a kid would at their age. They have problems expressing their feelings for one another, they struggle with their self image, they struggle finding dates to the ball, and so forth. It makes them even more relatable, and it makes us love our characters and cherish their relationships just as much. \n\nIn the end, this has been the most exciting film so far, while also being the dark turning point that makes this franchise what it is. I thought this film was fantastic, and a near perfect film.",

Watching Harry tackle the different obstacles and challenges that await him in the tournament has the audience at the edge of their seat. The CGI has come a long way since the sorcerers stone. The dragon sequence alone is breathtaking in how gorgeous it looks. The story telling is astounding, but falls just a bit shorter than The Prisoner of Azkaban. That is no knock against the film at all, as I saw that as a near masterpiece. I highly recommend this to any Harry Potter fan, and any fantasy fan alike.",

As such, this is without doubt the perfect time to have our cast at this greater age as they're far more able to fill the shoes a more in-depth adventure requires.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: It has to be said that on an aesthetic and spectacle level, it's far less pleasing than Michael Seresin and Alfonso Cuaron's efforts.\nVERDICT: Finally a properly exciting, engaging and adventurous journey for these great characters.

The actors have really come into their own, and seem very comfortable with their roles. Radcliffe takes on the part of an angsty teen with realism and believability, showing us that, despite being a much-admired wizard, he has no magic to fight off the horrors of puberty. Burgeoning adolescence is an underlying theme here, and it's explored so effectively and with such heart that I actually found myself feeling deeply for the characters, particularly in regards to the romance between Ron and Hermione, which contains undoubtedly the most moving scene. The effects are still spectacular, the action scenes are tense and engaging, and while the supporting characters don't have a lot to do, the focus is maintained where it needs to be. It might go on a bit long, and the climax is somewhat disappointing, but it brings a greater depth and seriousness, while managing to be funnier than even.

            "content": "Up until Goblet of Fire, the Potter franchise is a load of fun with some creepy imagery and dark concepts mixed in.  But Goblet of Fire is the turning point in the franchise for me.  Yes, Prisoner of Azkaban has its dark moments, but the grave sense of danger and threat isn't really present until the 4th film.\n\nThe Goblet of Fire opens with a pretty terrifying dream sequence involving a deformed Voldemort, which may very well be my favorite opening to any of the films in the series.  It comes right out and states that this franchise is no longer just a fun adventure, there are dangerously high stakes involved here, and Voldemort is a part of them.  Of course, part of the fun nature of this film is its mysteriousness and the unpredictability.  I've seen the film several times, but there's nothing quite like watching the Triwizard Tournament with someone who has no idea what they're in for.\n\nGoblet certainly brings some new characters along with its different identity.  Most notably, Brendan Gleeson's Professor Alastor 'Mad\u00acEye' Moody.  Looking back, it's difficult to assess how much I enjoyed the character considering he was kidnapped for nearly the entire length of the film, but his impact on Harry's tribulations throughout the film are felt.  I mean, why wouldn't he be an interesting character?  He's just the 4th straight new defense against the dark arts teacher to be hiding something in one way or another.\n\nNo matter, The Goblet of Fire is full of fresh adventures for the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  Most of the film involves Harry competing in the various events of the tournament (which ends up feeling a whole lot like a Hunger Games), but there's always time for some quality trio scenes.  Weirdly enough, this film made those scenes mostly deal with romance at the Yule Ball involving the three schools.  It's admittedly the next logical step in these teenagers lives, but sometimes it can be a bit overboard.  Some of it plays for comedy, but did I really need to see EVERYONE at Hogwarts, and I mean everyone, share the dance floor or have a scene with a love interet.\n\nIn many ways, The Goblet of Fire is the turning point in the franchise, and the first time you see someone of importance get hurt in a grave way.  Although you don't have a ton of time for Cedric to develop, his death altered the course of the series and the mindsets of those at Hogwarts.  That in itself makes it an important installment in the series.  Not to mention the fact that there's a dragon, a bada** maze, and one unsettling resurrection towards the end.  This is one of the better films, by a good margin.\n\n+Moody's introduction\n\n+Voldemort officially returns\n\n+More mature and powerfully written than previous entries\n\n+Turning point in the franchise\n\n-Too much romance\n\n9.2/10",

When the film came to a close on that incredibly up beat ending I wanted to find Newell and explain to him why the ending is so important. However, all those problems I have are taken back by the shear perfect directing. The style in this film is such a good balance between fun and dark that it creates its own. The story took Rowling 600 pages to explain, yet the film still manages to establish all the main details. The actors have once again improved, and the characters themselves now all have understandable and relatable motives. The mystery is excellent, the effects are wonderful, and the stakes have risen to new heights. A wonderful film, for a wonderful book.",

This year, the legendary Tri-Wizard Tournament brings the arrival of two competing schools to Hogwarts. When Harry's name is unexpectedly drawn by the Goblet of Fire to compete in the tournament---even though he is not eligible and is technically a fourth player---he must still compete in the dangerous contest.\n\nI really enjoyed this new Harry Potter film.  While condensed quite a bit from the largest novel in the series to date, screenwriter Steve Kloves streamlined J.K. Rowling's 700-plus-page opus into cinematic fighting form.  Meanwhile, director Mike Newell delicately balances between whimsy and the ominous, on the uncertain middle ground where Harry lives, poised between fun at school, teenage romance, and an ever-deepening dark abyss.  And the special effects, which threatened to overwhelm the first two movies, are seamlessly integrated here.  But the best part of the film are Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson, who are becoming amazing actors in their own right.  Who would have ever thought when these three kids were cast in these iconic roles all those years ago that they would be the best part of these films?  In a word, incredible!

The Goblet Fire takes a giant step away from the formula set by the first three films. This makes it not only unpredictable but also much more exciting. It manages to carry over the darker tone set by Prisoner of Azkaban but also raises the stakes even higher. Although Harry never finds himself in easy situations, this task is definitely a frightening one. Aside from that, the way the friendship dynamic between Harry and Ron is handled in the film is great. Ron finally speaks up about how frustrating it can be being Harry Potter's best friend. It also made their friendship after the events even stronger. The way the film ends is nice as well, it is a concrete ending but leaves you wanting more. I'm excited to continue the franchise but don't know how easy it will be for the further sequels to compete against the high bar raised by this eventful fourth installment.",

With the director of the third movie wash't going to direct the fourth movie, and is directed by Mike Newell, I figured that it wasn't going to be as grand as the third movie. Unfortunately I was right, but like the other films, it's still amazing. The cast are maturing, and improving too with age. The special effects are getting better as usual, and the plot is actually more different than I thought was going to be which is now a competition movie with a little of mystery in it. Like Gary Oldman, one of the highlights of the movie is  Brendan Gleeson who is hilarious in this, and also Ralph Fiennes who is really intimidating and is really creepy. Steve Kloves really knows how to write serious scenes and there's also some funny moments as usual from the Harry Potter films. Only problem I had, is that there wasn't more character development on some of the characters. I didn't know much of the competitors except Cedric Diggory a bit.

It (and, by extension, its film adaptation) has to bridge the gap between the middle-school feel of the first three stories, and the more adult themes of the last two books. The result is a little awkward and disjointed, but there are still some good parts.\n\nThere were some pretty major departures from the book here. This is, to a certain degree, understandable, as this book is significantly longer than its predecessors. What I take issue with is the adding in of extra scenes that could have been replaced with more plot-critical stuff. I take particular issue with the Horntail chase during the first task, and that awful mosh pit during the Yule Ball (I have never come so close to wanting to get up out of the theatre during a Potter film as I did here).\n\nAs always, we\u0092ve added some new cast members. Probably the biggest new part is Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody. He gives the role a certain uniqueness, although he plays it a little too comical (those are not words I would have ever expected to write). We also get Roger Lloyd-Pack as Barty Crouch Sr, who I didn\u0092t particularly care for; he had too many nervous ticks. On the other hand, his son was played by David Tennant, who I could gush about for another 30 000 words (I really like David Tennant, you guys). Pity he didn\u0092t have a bigger part. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn\u0092t mention every woman\u0092s favourite vampire, Robert Pattinson, who played Cedric Diggory. He did solidly, but was underwritten.\n\nThe tone of this film is significantly darker, signalling to us that we have left the innocence of childhood behind, and are about to enter a more adult world, filled with moral greys and ever-increasing danger.",

What's not to love about Harry, Hermione and Ron at this point? I'm finally sold on this whole Harry Potter business.\nAlso, hurrah for the special effects finally being up to snuff!\nFor the record, watching this particular episode in a post-Hunger Games society may make one acutely uncomfortable at the thought of a dangerous tri-wizard tournament, as the thematic similarities are uncanny. It didn't detract from the film, but I frequently agonized in frustration at Dumbledore allowing all this business to go on.",

            "content": "It has become increasingly common for different instalments of a film franchise to be helmed by different directors. Even in a series as long-running as James Bond, it was quite common for directors like Guy Hamilton and John Glen to helm several consecutive stories. With the brand now seemingly more important than any form of directorial stamp, it is more usual for different hands to come in and do things their way, albeit within clearly set parameters.\n\nAll of which brings us to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the halfway point of the Harry Potter series. With Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n electing not to direct a second film, and moving on to Children of Men, the job was given to Mike Newell, best known for the Oscar-nominated comedy Four Weddings and a Funeral. But whatever misgivings one may have about his back catalogue, the appointment paid off, with Goblet of Fire matching its predecessor in many respects and possibly even improving in others.\n\nNewell's versatility as a director is evident throughout Goblet of Fire, in that he is required to pull off many different kinds of scenes and handle several key emotional developments in the characters. Goblet of Fire was the point at which the Harry Potter books began to grow in size, which in turn meant that the filmmakers had to cram a lot more into the adaptations. Newell deliberately chose to \"put aside\" all elements of the novel which were not directly linked to Harry's journey, and the result is that the film remains a generally focussed effort, despite being the second-longest at 157 minutes.\n\nIn my review of the previous instalment, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I commented that the film did a good job of setting up conflict between the three main characters, challenging Harry's image of a \"goody two-shoes\" and deepening the characters as a result. Newell's effort builds on this in spades, with all three characters now firmly in the throes of adolescence and Harry struggling with his reputation as the chosen one as his visions grow stronger and more terrifying.\n\nOne of the most refreshing and entertaining aspects of Goblet of Fire is seeing our three main characters go through periods of intensely hating each other. This may sound like schadenfreude, coming from a man who's always preferred Tolkien to Rowling, but conflict is essential to good drama, and the series was still playing catch-up after the emotional stodge of the first two films. Our three heroes are at a point where their identities are being called in question by forces beyond their control, whether their own hormones or the Dark Lord. Under such circumstances, in-fighting is not only expected, it should be welcomed.\n\nIt's for this reason that the ball scene is one of the best in the entire film. For all the thrilling spectacle of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, scenes like this are the emotional heart of the film. There is a degree of empathy that we share with the characters before any of the arguments occur: we remember how dorky and nervous we seemed at our high school dances. But once we see Hermione erupt at her embarassment, or Ron scowl at her in resentment, it all comes alive. By making us question these friendships so comprehensively, it makes the more malevolent moments more weighty, giving us more to fear and less on which to depend.\n\nMuch of Goblet of Fire is concerned with identity and about characters having to pretend to be something they're not. Harry spends the entire film in a state of reluctance: while he doesn't go all mopey about it, he clearly doesn't want to be involved in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. On the other side, we have Barty Crouch Jr. (played well by David Tennant), who uses polyjuice potion to impersonate a teacher and gain Harry's confidence. Both characters are under pressure to live up to their identities, with Harry even struggling to fight Voldemort in their climactic battle in the graveyard. The only real distinction between them is choice: Crouch chooses to be driven by malice, while Harry's destiny is already sealed.\n\nWhen the book was released, Rowling gave many interviews in which she cited the story's main theme as one of bigotry. She said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that it was \"probably the thing I detest most. All forms of intolerance, the whole idea of 'that which is different from me is necessarily evil'.\" It would be fair to assume that the main vehicle for this theme would be Voldemort, whose contempt for muggles is conveyed in the graveyard. But the film also focusses on bigotry as an advanced form of favouritism, something evident in Draco Malfoy's behaviour and to a certain extent in the tournament.\n\nThis brings us on fittingly to the return of Voldemort, specifically his return to a physical body and the performance of Ralph Fiennes. Bringing Voldemort back was bound to happen sooner or later, and Newell and screenwriter Steve Kloves work hard to justify this, gradually building up the darker aspects of the plot until it becomes tragically inevitable. After this instalment the series struggled to keep Voldemort interesting, with the final conflict between him and Harry being steadily delayed for increasingly contrived reasons. But within the confines of this film, it works - at least up to a point.\n\nFiennes' performance has often been a sticking point with fans, with people being split over whether he was truly intimidating or unintentionally hilarious. It's certainly true that Fiennes walks the line between horror and comedy, and not always with confidence: while it's not exactly Victor Quartermaine from Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, it's a much more larger-than-life villain than Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. Ultimately Fiennes does what the film needs to do, giving Voldemort a believable presence and showing the threat he poses to Harry. It's not a complete success, but it fulfils the requirements of the role.\n\nOthers within the adult cast fare far better in delivering convincing portrayals. David Tennant may be associated with heroic roles after his tenure on Doctor Who, but his performance as Barty Crouch, Jr. has an appealingly skin-crawling quality. He manages to maintain an almost manic state without ever coming across as a ham, allowing his outbursts to become properly threatening. The late Roger Lloyd Pack is also good as his father, a bureaucrat who seems racked with guilt and nerves for what he did to his son and the peril which Harry is in. And Brendon Gleeson is perfectly cast as Mad Eye Moody, bringing his unusual physicality to the fore in the classroom scenes and giving us a lot to laugh at when he's angry.\n\nThe other big asset of Goblet of Fire is its visuals. Roger Pratt returns as cinematographer, having previously lent his talents to Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. No longer shackled by Chris Columbus, he does a much better job here, continuing the work of Cuar\u00f3n and Michael Seresin of bringing out the dark blues and blacks for an intimidating atmosphere. Pratt is a fantasy veteran, having worked with Terry Gilliam on Brazil, The Fisher King and 12 Monkeys; he knows a thing or two about creating a sense of magic or horror, making the maze scenes feel like they've escaped from The Shining.\n\nThere are a couple of faults with Goblet of Fire which prevent it from completely surpassing its predecessor. Despite Newell's best efforts and intentions to keep the action focussed on Harry, the plot still feels occasionally meandering, as if more effort were being expended on something than was necessary. Whole sections of the book have been left out, and others changed so that different characters could get screen time, and it may be that elements of the books simply don't work on film. But it's still a baggy offering, even if it's an enjoyable one.\n\nThe other flaw, as with many of the Potter films, is predictability. I complained in my Prisoner of Azkaban review about the Defence Against the Dark Arts convention, which has gone from being a mild irritation to an example of lazy writing. Equally Harry's inclusion in the wizard tournament may turn out to be narratively integral, but the circumstances in which he becomes involved are an enormous contrivance. It feels like the plot is making every effort to keep Harry at the centre of the action even when it doesn't make sense, to the point of setting up rules only to break them. The smart, or at least different thing to do, would be to have him completely marginalised, letting Voldemort approach him more directly rather than luring him in through coincidences. \n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a confident addition to the franchise which builds on the successes of its predecessor to create an emotionally satisfying experience. It still suffers from the ongoing flaws of bagginess and predictability, facets which would become more problematic during David Yates' tenure. But if you can look beyond that, you are looking at a film which rivals Prisoner of Azkaban as the high point to which the other films aspire.",

The only problem I had was some of the acting and this brought down the score a lot. Daniel was pretty great in the other films, but he seemed to slack off in this one. Also what the hell was up with the long hair in this movie. Did they all decide to grow it out because everyone had long hair here. I so have give this movie credit. This is the first time where hermione is actually old enough to be hot. \n\nThe Tri wizard Tournament  is where this movie shines. Each challenge was more frightening than the next and the emotional content of the film was very good. Overall this wasn't harry potter standard, but not the worst so far. 8/10",

I was amazed by the story that time before I got a chance to read the book. I was impressed with the book more than the movie.\n\nLet me first start by saying about how much it was cut from the source material. I was upset at first, but then I remember how long the book and they cannot extend the movie longer. I understand why a lot of parts have to be cut.\n\nBut let me list down some of the things of the chances that I am not okay with because I felt like they're unnecessary or they're important to the story.\n\n 1-Hermione hugging Harry Potter before Rita Skeeter gets a chance to take a picture of them for more publicity of the Tri-Wizard Cup.\n 2-The scenes where Hermione was training Harry for the first task.\n 3-Mrs. Weasley, Dobby and Winky were absent in this movie. Those three characters had important character development, with the last two mentioned having important story development as well.\n 4-References of Dementors' connection with Lord Voldemort is removed.\n\nDespite the numerous cuts, I still enjoyed it. But it's sad it comes along with the irritation of how many cuts it have to take for the required running time.\n\nI feel like some parts of the movie might not be understandable to viewers who haven't read the book beforehand. They would make sense to them if they do. This is a common problem for books being adapted into movies, though this problem is (kinda) solved for YA movies such as The Hunger Games and Divergent.\n\nThe humor is still retained in the movie which is good because Harry has some quite sassy humor in the books.\n\nThey showed Rita Skeeter but she wasn't featured much in the movie. She is a lot worst when I read the books.\n\nI give props to the scenes where the tasks were held. They were better than what I imagined.\n\nThe movie felt a bit of a teenager movie but then again, the characters are growing up and that shows maturity among the characters. This is actually good if you wanted a story about wizardry but it also has a sense of realism.\n\nI like how the tone suddenly became dark in this one. I hope this isn't an unpopular opinion.\n\nI enjoyed the movie and this remains my favorite Harry Potter movie despite its flaws. I like the book better though, sad to say.",

            "content": "Rating-7.5/10\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire see's our young friend In his fourth year at Hogwarts, and very much in danger yet again. The movie is dark, slick and all together a new kind of Harry Potter which seems to take us in a new direction when it comes to Potter and wants us to feel much more dark but also more emotion. The film has thrills everywhere and the plot is pretty fun, it's not every film you get Dragons, huge hedges and Ron Weasley all rolled in one but this one makes us laugh or it did for me, and here below are my thoughts on the adventure.\n\nThe plot isn't necessarily unique but still captures a certain imagination of thrilling chases, battles and teenage angst in which there is quite a bit. Yes this is truly the movie where Harry, Ron and Hermione start to realise they are becoming more mature and with that comes relationships etc which kind of intertwines with the more serious nature of the plot. On that point the serious side of the story, it is much darker than before, now Prisoner of Azkaban was possibly darker in the whole set up of the plot but this is a little darker throughout, gossip of Lord Voldemort growing in power and his gang of \"Death eaters\" stoke fear in our characters and even new additions to the teaching staff make Neville Longbottom wince. \n\nThe film is pretty well cast, new additions a plenty especially with all the new schools we get to see. But for me the one best new face is Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody who just makes the film funny and not necessarily in a fun way, his mannerisms are second to none and his speedy eye makes the plot a little more interesting. Among the new young actors is Robert Pattinson who as new boy Cedric Diggory is good and appears alongside others such as Stanislav Ianevski(Victor Krum) and Clemence Poesy(Fleur Delacour) who make the cast a big one but a good one. \n\nMike Newell is drafted in to direct this and although he isn't bad, I didn't like the way in which he did it. I just felt he sets it up in a way in which the actors can seem awkward and although he deals with the massive scenes involved, he doesn't get the dramatic side out until right at the end. With source material so huge, this is really the first big challenge that the series gets when adapting but I felt Steve Kloves adapts it well and Newell does it well enough to make this a very worthy addition to the franchise. \n\nGoing into more technical terms it is filmed well, the design is nice and the entire look and feel is one the best of the movies now four in. With John Williams not scoring this movie you might not expect it to be as epic and although it does sound a little different to before, new man Patrick Doyle thumps this one out and in the process creates a really good score, that isn't afraid of going all blockbuster on the whole show. I felt even the special effects get driven up slightly from before, they improve in a way only hundreds of millions can do but in any case, good work.\n\nSo Goblet of Fire keeps Harry Potter going on and really keeps it steady, not a better film than the previous instalment for me but oh so close though. Yes Daniel Radcliffe and co just have no signs of slowing down, and with the backing this franchise has there is no wonder people love these movies and the series as a whole, me included.",

            "content": "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was always my favourite Harry Potter film of the series due to the concept of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, so re-viewing it would not be any challenge for me.\n\nAnd that proved to be the case, even though I found many flaws in the film.\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a great film and it has a simple story which based its complications more on the characters and the mythological territory that it explores, but it has a lot of flaws in its internal logic.\nThe flaws all boil down to the titular object which ends up putting Harry Potter in the Tri-Wizard tournament. For one thing, the film doesn't explain how Harry Potter's name actually comes out of it. While the Goblet of Fire is a binding contract which cannot be broken, the rules of it dictate that only one student from each of the three competing schools may compete, hence the title Tri-Wizard tournament. How it actually allowed a fourth name out of the goblet is never explained, though it can be assumed as the man who was responsible for Harry Potter's name coming out of the Goblet of Fire was not a student at any of the competing schools, he was of a new ground that the Goblet had not picked someone from out of before and had to choose someone from whatever team the responsible man was from. But this isn't explained and left me asking questions. But also, if the Goblet of Fire is a binding contract as the characters state then it has to follow the rules. As the Tri-Wizard tournament only allows three competitors who all must be of a certain age, once it has picked its three competitors it cannot allow any others. And if it allows a fourth competitor, this breaks the rules of the Tri-Wuzard tournament and therefore nullifies the contract, ensuring that either the Tri-Wizars tournament must be called off for that Harry Potter is not allowed to compete. The Goblet of Fire isn't deeply understandable due to the fact that it's decisions don't make sense, and it throws the entire story into question and renders Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire impossible even in the Harry Potter universe. Perhaps the source novel explains if more, perhaps it doesn't, but the movie left me wandering and that unfortunately renders viewers likely to ask questions that the film cannot answer.\nAlso, there is another thing unexplained in the story. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone depicts Voldemort as having deceased after Harry Potter destroyed him with what Huey Lewis refers to as \"The Power of Love\" yet surviving as a ghost for an indefinite time period. While in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, he is scene alive in a small and weak physical form. I'm sure there is logic behind that, but it isn't explained and after what happened in the end of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone I simply wonder what the deal was. While it could be explained in the source novel, the movie leaves the answer ambiguous and left me befuddled. Essentially, despite a basic story in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, small story elements that are key to it are overlooked and leave me disappointed and uncertain as to if I would still call this one my favourite of the series. \nBut luckily enough I can still say with honesty that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is vast entertainment.\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is my former favourite Harry Potter film due to the concept of the Tri-Wizard tournament. The story follows a direct path while it lets subplots unfold around it and allows new characters to introduce themselves to the series, all while it explores more of the mysteries of Voldemort and the mythology of dragons and mermaids. So the fantasy undertones of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire are really interesting, and the atmosphere is dark and thrilling consistently as Harry Potter faces the potential impending death of a situation he became mysteriously dragged in to. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire holds no reserves with exploring its dark territory and going into the mysteries of the magical universe. And while it's doing all that it doesn't neglect the importance of going into depth about its characters, so it tackles its stories from all angles and ensures that it is a consistently interesting one. One of the strongest aspects of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is how it dramatises the nature of Cedric's death when his father cries for his fallen son in a perfectly dramatised moment which almost had me in tears, so the dramatic effect of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is superior to in any of the previous films as it touches on a saddening death directly when its predecessors did so indirectly.\nAnd from a visual perspective, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is terrific. As well as riding a skilfully composed musical score which keeps things intense and atmospheric consistent until the dramatic finale, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire contains the best visual effects to date which puts extraneous detail into its mythological characters, particularly its dragons. The visual effects make the experience awesome and depict the finest use of wand magic to date, particularly in the final duel sequences. The visual effects prove to just increase in quality more and more with every film, and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire features the finest to date.\nAnd while maintaining the same original production design for Hogwarts, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire also uses some new designs to touch upon its fresh locations where the Tri-Wizard Tournament occurs which allows the massive spectacle of things to be full of memorable imagery. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best visual spectacle of the series thus far and works at delving into its dark territory without trouble. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire tells it's complicated story very well with excellent technical elements, and it is easy for viewers to find themselves lost in the magic of the story, forgetting that it is a movie.\nAnd as the material in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has gotten darker, the actors have gotten more serious.\nDaniel Radcliffe stands to tackle the most screen time in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, even more than in the preceding films because the story is focused on him as he faces the Tri-Wizard Tournament against his will. And the emotional tension that comes with someone risking their life against dragons and other life-threatening mythology while keeping an eye out for the safety and  wellbeing of all the other competitors is executed perfectly by Daniel Radcliffe. He rides the lead role with charisma and tackle the dark territory of the film with ease, and his sharp but troubled line delivery puts more depth into the character which makes Harry Potter an even better figure.\nRupert Grint faces a new side to the character Ron Weasley in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire because audiences bear witness to his more jealous side when Harry Potter ends up in the Tri-Wizard tournament or when Hermione Granger gets a date with somebody else before he could ask her out, so we see a foreshadowing for the later more negative aspects of the character in which he is a bit of an ass. And Rupert Grint gets the character dead on with accuracy to facial gestures and rough line delivery, establishing a sense of awkwardness but a certain fearless anger at the same time. Rupert Grint steps up to another side in his iconic character Ron Weasley, and that makes Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire more appealing.\nEmma Watson has reached a stage where she is becoming a stronger woman, and she puts that into the character easily because audiences bear witness to Hermione Granger developing into a woman more than anytime before in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Emma Watson steps into her role as Hermione Granger with ease once again and reveals a more fierce emotional side to her where she interacts with the other cast members in a more aggressive fashion at certain moments. Consistently she emits the same kind of insightful intelligence which make Hermione Granger the iconic character that she is, and when combined with the kind of age and wisdom that comes with her gradual development as a person, so she proves to be growing stronger as an actress as she gets older.\nAnd the returning efforts of Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman and Michael Gambon all manage to make an entertaining impact, while Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire also faces the presence of newcomer Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody, and the image of him too. The character Alastor Moody proves to be a strong and fierce wizard which makes him a good teacher of defence against the dark a rats, and at the same time he emits a sense if mysterious darkness which leave audiences always asking questions which the film does not fail to answer by the end of its running time. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire boasts another talented actor stepping into the role tackled by three others before, and he gives it a more intense and mysterious effort than any of the others which make him one of the best to be cast in the role of a defence against the dark arts teacher.\nAnyone who has ever seen Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire should never ever see Twilight. As a kid I never saw any of such films but always enjoyed Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and ever since I unfortunately watched all of the first Twilight movie, it is hard for me to look Robert Pattinson in the eyes again. While Twilight was a waste of his talents, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire proved that he actually had them by giving him the role of Cedric Diggory which is really the finest role he has ever played. While Twilight attempted to capitalise on his boyish charm, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire managed to harness it. Robert Pattinson has a friendly youthful charm which he puts into the role which makes him a character easy to care about, and it makes Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire a more compelling feature. \nAnd Miranda Richardson who is a legendary British actress for her diverse collection of roles in films like me The Crying Game or the Blackadder TV series is given the perfect part for her which features a relentlessly perfect dedication to portraying a stereotypical gossip columnist and doing it with the comedic charm that viewers of Blackadder have come to love about her, so her performance is a nostalgic one.\nDavid Tennant also gave a fine performance during his brief screen time.\nAnd lastly, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the first in the series to feature two time Academy Award nominated actor Ralph Fiennes in the role of Lord Voldemort. With makeup and costuming which leaves him looking nothing like he truly is, Ralph Fiennes disappears into the role and gives a more antagonistic and dark performance than his role as Amon Goeth in the masterpiece Schindler's List. Seriously, the character Lord Voldemort is unforgettable due to Ralph Fiennes' dedication to character, and he is a perfectly dark and twisted figure who takes on the role flawlessly. \n\nSo Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a complex and striking visual spectacle with maturity and dark mythology to it, even if it lacks explanation and justification of particular internal logic.",

Second only to the Deathly Hallows.\n\nAs the turning point of the whole series, it makes sense to invoke some more growth in the dark side of the magical wold. I love the book, and it's translation to a movie came out nothing short of brilliant. \n\nSome cuts were made, but I will never understand those people who think that it made the series suffer. Being a huge Harry Potter fan, you have to be skilled at criticism (or just prejudiced) not to love this. I highly recommend it to everyone. I thought the the thin tale of Prisoner of Azkaban wasn't as good as the others, but director Mike Newell picks up the track where Chris Columbus left it. I'm impressed.  \n\nRalph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort makes his first appearance here. Mike Newell couldn't have found a better actor to play Voldemort. Although his appearance is pretty short, it was the best(or worst)scene in the entire movie.\n\nThe last parts of the movie were one of the most amazing scenes in the entire eight part saga. It's a real development in the movie, as Voldemort returns, still determined to take over the wizard world. He also shows that he won't rest until he's finally succeeded in murdering his worst enemy, Harry Potter. (If you don't know that much, start from the beginning). \n\n\"I'm going to kill you Harry Potter.

            "content": "After the solid start to the Potter franchise leading to the series high of Azkaban, we suddenly take a little stumble in quality with The Goblet of Fire. It's not awful, but it is a clumsily told story. All too often jumping from scene to scene with seemingly little attention paid to creating a believable narrative flow. Some of the character motivations seemed off too, and at times Potter and friends were almost unrecognizable. Especially Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), who's sudden weird turn against Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) early on in the story seemed really contrived.\n\nThe film does have its moments though, and the simplistic story does eventually lead to the reveal of 'he who must not be named', played with sinister class by Ralph Fienes. The visual effects as expected are extremely good, but I found the general look of the film less focused, and on one or two occasions badly framed.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nGoblet of Fire makes no attempt to provide any back story to the existing characters, and it's not much better at introducing the new ones. This entry of the franchise cannot stand on its own, and you'll have to make sure you've watched the first three films before you take this on.\n\nBest Format:\n\nDespite some irregularity with the visuals, this is still best viewed in a theater. At home a HD showing is recommended.\n\nWorst moment for me:\n\nThe Potter v Ron contrived fall out. Ron turns on Potter - his friend of several years now - after his name is spat out of the fiery goblet. Never mind that Ron already witnessed his two brothers try to fool the Goblet to accept underage tournament contestants, and fail. Never mind that Harry actually seemed pretty happy about not being eligible for the contest. Never mind the fact that in the years they've known each other, Harry has never once shown the slightest interest in his own fame.\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com",

The scale is larger and whilst the stakes aren't exactly that high we finally get to see Voldemort in a powerful form during a spectacular finale that only echoes further danger to come. The Tri-Wizard tournaments are an exciting set of sequences that are similar to The Hunger Games, only less bloody and with less competitors, but the special effects and tension, especially in the Mermaid scene, leave a lasting impression and certainly stands as the highlight of the movie. Despite a slack pace every now and then this fourth instalment brings the cast closer together, and even though the dance scene is cliche it does feel sweet and it's a break from the dark tone. I only wish that more scenes would take place inside Hogwarts, that's what made the first two movies feel more eerie and magical. Ralph Fiennes' first performance as the Lord middles between scary and a little campy, but once I've watch the final four movies I'm sure that'll change drastically.",

That's right, I said it.  \"The Goblet of Fire\" is by far the worst of the Harry Potter films, which is unfortunate because it was my absolute favorite of the books.  So granted, I had high expectations for this film, but this movie is a whole new level of disappointment.\n\nSo where does \"The Goblet of Fire\" go wrong?  First and foremost, it is a poor adaption of the book.  In fairness, this is a long novel, so in order to keep the movie within the 2.5 hour frame, they had to trim some stuff down.  But the film trims out the good stuff.  They cut down the 1st and 3rd task, and cut out the Blast-ended Skrewts all together.  I loved the skrewts in the book and I was hugely disappointed not to see them.  Honestly though, I would rather it through a 4-hour movie if it meant getting back the 1st task, 3 task, Blast-ended skrewts, along with Dobby, Winky, and everything else that was cut.\n\nThis film is bad, due to the poor adapting on the part of the writers, but it isn't any fault of the actors.  The cast gives the usually outstanding performance.  We finally get to see He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in the flesh, and not only does Voldemort look awesome, but Ralph Fiennes was an excellent choice to play the Dark Lord.\n\nI've just told you how bad \"The Goblet of Fire\" is.  I, who am a huge fan of the book.  However, I do recommend this film.  Don't get me wrong, it is an entertaining film, but it's just not faithful to the book.  So be warned Potter fans!  If you're expecting something like the book, you'll be disappointed.  Just watch this film so that you can move on to the bigger and better things to come!",

Right from the opening scene we can tell Harry Potter is taking a darker and more mature turn. Harry has to compete in the Triwizard Tournament, a completely dangerous event in which kids risk their lives for a trophy. If you don't analyze the story too much, it's a great ride. Once again the acting is top notch and the score is epic. There are dark forces at work and the sub plots are tied into the main storyline so well, never becoming too convoluted. The kids are getting older, and the film perfectly showcases the more mature side of this awesome fantasy series. The action is exciting and well shot, the dialogue is occasionally quite funny, and best of all, the plot twists are not predictable. The movie does a great job of taking the massive book's most interesting material out and cutting it down. Maybe it's still a bit long but this is a great movie. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire gets 4/5 stars (A-).",

It also had a pretty good story that was exciting, chilling, riveting, and also quite sad. Harry is back fighting Voldemort encountering a lot of what started out as a dream and then winds up to be a quest of strength and courage. Is it bad to say that I got misty eyed when Cedric died? Yes, you heard right. A scene in Harry Potter with the guy from Twilight nearly made me cry. The realism and intense emotion just sucked you in to the drama. I also have to mention the big three and how they've come to terms with one another. You have some cliches, like romance blossoming, homecoming dances, and finding out who you are among all that. But it's factored in such a subtle way that it would be stupid to deduct from the film because of it. In my opinion, Goblet of Fire is a masterpiece.

I sure do. Anyways, The Goblet of Fire has gotten a reputation for being a mess among fans. I personally have never read the book so I cannot judge on that front, but what I can say is that this entry does suffer from Bi-Polar Tone Issues. This has the biggest contrast between the light-hearted fun and the dark gruesome scenes in the whole series. One scene will involve a giant attack on the Quidditch World Cup followed by Ron Weasley being amazed by girls' butts. The storyline involving Barty Crouch and the Death Eaters is actually a pretty interesting one but it takes a back seat for most of the movie for the Tri-Wizard Tournament and the Winter Ball Dance segment that takes up almost 1/3 of the movie. The Tri-Wizard Challenges are entertaining enough and all the teenage sexual tension is fun to see and gets some great laughs, but it doesn't flow as nicely as Prisoner of Azkaban did or even Chamber of Secrets for that matter. This is what happens when you hire the director of \"Prince Of Persia: The Sands of Time\". SPOILER ALERT... You know this one was coming... Cedric Diggory's death is so hard to watch. It's brutal! It always gets me in tears. END OF SPOILERS. Although this film is not as good as I once thought it was, there are still some very entertaining parts. The additions of Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort and Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody were some of the best casting choices in the whole series and the Dragon Battle was pretty exciting. I just wish it had more focus on its story and tone instead of focusing on scenes like Moaning Myrtle trying to catch a peek at Harry's... Magic Wand... Sorry, It was too easy.",

But pretty much the very first scene, with the old man creeping through the cemetery and then up that creaky staircase, made me realize that 'Harry Potter' was back in the hands of a decent  director.  The movie does have its flaws, of course, but for the most part, I think Mike Newell succeeded perfectly in transitioning the series from childish and magical into suspenseful and dark.  Brendan Gleeson and Robert Pattinson both worked very well as their respective characters, and the three main protagonists are finally given the chance to showcase their acting as realistic, conflicted teenagers, who struggle with such concepts as asking the opposite sex to the ball.  Plus Harry falls in love for the first time.  I'm a weirdo, and since the scene in 'Philosopher's Stone', when Hermione gets upset over Ron teasing her, I was painfully in love with Emma Watson and Hermione Granger.  In the sequence when Ron and Hermione start fighting at the Yule Ball, I couldn't help but smile, being finally given a scene that hints towards the unspoken love between the two characters.  The action scenes are done just as perfectly, and thanks to Mike Newell, this entire film is richly enhanced with many little details that only a good director could accomplish.  There's the scene when Mad-Eye Moody teases the class with the spider, and then suggests that he force it to drown itself, instantly shifting a humorous scene into one of sinister tension.  There's the scene when Harry and Cedric fight side by side as they run for the portal-key.  Even that little moment when Moody turns around to face Harry before he enters the maze, and subtlety points him in the right direction.  There are so many more of these little touches that I just really appreciated, and in short, I'm quite shocked and disheartened that 'The Prisoner Of Azkaban' is considered the best movie, and not this one.",

The villains' plot also makes little sense and could easily have been solved before the story even kicks off. Despite this, the film is well paced and the performances still generally impress particularly from new additions to the cast like Brendan Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody and Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort.

I'll admit that David Tennant's performance was good, but Harry and the other established characters continued on the path of hamming it up. An early criticism of mine is the overdose of dazzling, yet often pointless special effects (did nobody question the football stadium?), and the relative rarity of the action scenes doesn't seem to help, as it means more scenes of boring dialogue.",

This was the first one of the books that I actually bought from a local book store, just sayin'.  Anyway, a year after Prisoner of Azkaban I was 18, in college now and very excited for a film that might take a turn similar to Azkaban.  Unfortunately...much like the backfiring of the Killing Curse on Harry, the film felt like a potentially great sequel gone wrong.  I dunno, maybe the acting was a bit off, maybe the directing, but it just felt a bit of a bore, and since the Triwizard Tournament was such a cleverly-conjured up idea, I was hoping for something good.  And don't get me wrong, there are some fairly good moments in the film, such as Lord Voldemort's return, but overall it kinda felt a bit dull and off-track.  Granted the now not-very-child actors are still working on acting, but maybe it's the fact that the characters are acting TOO teenager-ish.  I don't want to put out any stereotypes but they seem to be acting too American.  Or maybe it's the notable lack of the Dursleys, who have until now been very prominent in the beginning of each film.  Or maybe it's the fact that there's a really awkward bathhouse scene in there.  Or maybe it's because Robert Pattinson, who would go on to star in Twilight of all films, was in this and Twilight is pretty much just a horny vampire version of Harry Potter fan fiction (which is on it's own pretty bad).  Whatever the case, Goblet of Fire was a substantial disappointment and on the list of Harry Potter films that I didn't like.  But on the upside...DAVID TENNANT IS IN THIS MOVIE! THE FUCKING DOCTOR IS HERE! YAY!!!!",

            "content": "\"Hey, my eyes aren't swimming with the ghost of my past.\"\n\nAfter the brilliant and darker film direction that was Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Alfonso Cuaron moved on and British director Mike Newell, known for making British comedies, took over the direction in the Harry Potter franchise. It could have been a disaster for a director known for his comedies, but Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is another Harry Potter delight, even if Prisoner of Azkaban is a far superior film.\n\nIn this film, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is excited to go back to Hogwarts, but is troubled by nightmares about Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) hiring a servant to bring him over, and an attack by Death Eaters, or Voldemort's followers, at the Quidditch World Cup. \n\nAt Hogwarts, however, Harry is excited to hear that the school is having a Triwizard Tournament between two other schools, where one 17-year-old wizard from each school will compete in three tasks, and their names will be picked out of a goblet of fire. All goes well until Harry, who is too young to participate, has his name picked out of the goblet, causing a fall-out between him and Ron (Rupert Grint) and causes everyone to turn away from him. Harry has to fight a dragon, save friends in a lake filled with creepy mermaids, and survive in a never-ending maze in order to get through the tournament in one piece, unaware that Voldemort is waiting on the other side.\n\nReturning to Goblet of Fire includes Emma Watson as Hermione, Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, Alan Rickman as Snape, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Jason Issacs as Lucius Malfoy, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Timothy Spall as Wormtail, or Pettigrew in the predecessor, Robert Hardy as Cornelius Fudge, Mark Williams as Mr. Weasley Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, and Shirley Henderson as Moaning Myrtle.\n\nNew to the film includes Brendon Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody, a crippled dark wizard hunter who is this year's Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Robert Pattinson (who invited that kid?) as Cedric Diggory, the other Hogwarts participant, Clemence Posey and Stanislav Ianevski as Fleur Delacor and Victor Krum, the other Triwazard contestants, Roger Lloyd Pack as Barty Crouch, a Triwizard Judge and a Ministry worker, and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter, a newspaper reporter who's work is about as bad as a supermarket tabloid.\n\nEver since the film was released back in 2005, many have complained over the stuff cut from the book to this film. Scenes include more gossips from Rita Skeeter, Hermione starting a campaign to free house elves, including Dobby, from working in the kitchen, and longer flashback sequences. The problem with these scenes in the book is that they have literally nothing to do with the Triwizard Tournament at all. What Mike Newell succeeded in making this film is eliminating all the unnecessary scenes from the book and focusing more on the Tournament in general. And with that in mind, Goblet of Fire is one great Potter film.\n\nAs usual, the visual effects are out of this world. From the mermaids, to Voldemort's appearance, to the dragons, to the crazy looks that the competitors look like in order to swim underwater for an hour, is just wonderfully created and the visual makers should be congratulated, even when it's a hundred years from now, when they're all dead.\n\nI also love the darker tone in this as well. Taking off after the brilliant direction in Prisoner of Azkaban, Newell takes the tone in its predecessor and continues the dark, mature approach, with several sequences, such as the return of Voldemort, to be extremely frightening. This was the first Potter film to get a PG-13 rating, and it's well-deserved.\n\nThe lead actors have continued to mature in their roles, and the one who shines out the most in this one is Radcliffe. Since he's the one that's in the competition, he has the most screen time of the three and the Harry character is at his most thrilling yet. Still sore over his troubled life, Harry has to fight in out to survive, and I love that he doesn't care about winning the tournament, he just wants to survive. That's a good message that everybody needs.\n\nAlso, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson shine again in their roles, and they mature as well, especially in the Yule Ball sequence, a scene filled with love, hate, and jealousy. I won't give much away, but let's just say that the scene is entertaining and brilliant.\n\nI'm still impressed with the performances of Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane. Brendon Gleeson is fun as the new professor, and has some hilarious moments, such as turning Malfoy into a ferret. Miranda Richardson is memorable as the gossip reporter, and I enjoyed some of the gossip her character put out (the opening quote comes from these scenes). People, especially fans of the book, have complained about Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore being unfaithful to Richard Harris's performance in the first two, such as scenes where he yells loudly to the students to get his attention and violently grabbing Harry when he confronts him about putting his name in the goblet of fire. To put it straight, Michael Gambon is an actor, and he can do the role in any way he wants. In my book, he did Dumbledore fine in this. Sure, he's a little different than Harris, but he's not the worst actor in the world.\n\nThe performance that was really bad in this was Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory. This role was done a few years before Pattinson was given the role of that creepy, ugly vampire in Twilight, and either way, Pattinson just can't act. Although he does Cedric better than the vampire, his looks are ugly (I just simply can't understand why girls love him so much) and his dialogue is pretty bad, with some being unintentionally funny, in a bad way. His character has a sad ending to him, which caused about everyone to cry, but I viewed it as a happy thought. Bye bye Pattinson, and good riddance to the franchise.\n\nLast thing I have to mention is the score. The first score not to be scored by John Williams, the score, done by Patrick Doyle, keeps the John Williams themes and ads a bit of epicness in the film. While the Prisoner of Azkaban score still remains the best score at this point, Doyle's take on the theme is a memorable one.\n\nWhile Pattinson tried to ruin the experience period, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire shows that the franchise has matured greatly and makes one thrilling film, even if the best at this point still remains Prisoner of Azkaban.\n\n\"I don't want you behaving like a bumbling, bunch of baboons,\"",

            "content": "Year Four is probably my favourite in the series, the dazzling special effects and tremendous action sequences make up for moving so far away from the source material. Harry and the rest of the characters have visually matured allowing the director to put them in more perilous and threatening positions, thus changing the entire dynamic of the series making it darker and more visually stunning. The actors' skills have improved dramatically over the course of the entire series and they are no more honed than they are in this movie, the script plays a big part but the strained relationship between Harry and Ron with Hermione playing peacemaker is one of the more impressive plot points in the entire film as the actors play it so well and genuine (helped with a little bit of foul language from Rupert Grint, helping with the more mature tone of the film). Also starring a younger Robert Pattinson (you know, from those movies about the vampires) in his best role to date, playing one of Harry's opponents in the \"Tri-Wizard Tournament\" whose untimely demise gives us one of the series' more emotional moments and showing us that Daniel Radcliffe is not an emotionless drone. A quite brilliant instalment in one of the best film series' of all time, it was always going to be hard to better Prisoner Of Azkaban but Goblet Of Fire made a very good attempt and may have even succeeded.",

            "content": "A great addition to the Potter films, 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is darker and yet, still fanciful.  Harry returns to Hogwarts yet again, this time to compete in the Triwizard Tournament, a cometition where battling Dragons, defeating mermaids, and maneuvering through a giant evil, and bewitched maze are just as gamely as anything else.  Something different and well done about this chapter is the way the growing pains and awkardness of the kids comes out.  Of course, Voldemort returns here, and he is played menacingly and intriguingly by Ray Fiennes.  Other great performances include Maggie Smith's McGonnagall, Alan Rickman's Snape, Michael Gambon's Dumbledore, and Brendon Gleeson's Mad Eye Moody, the new and strange Defense Against the Dark Arts theacher.  However, it's the kids once again who steal the show.  Daniel Radcliffe is really coming into his own as an actor, as is Rupert Grint, but I wished Steve Kloves would've written in the resourcefullness and cleverness of Hermione Granger as he did in the previous films as that made her my favorite character.  As much fun as 'Goblet of Fire' is, there are a few problems: 1 - The music, written by Patrick Doyle, is rusty and tired, sticking to unexciting adventure cliches and not adding a single touch of inventiveness or originality.  2 - The screenplay by Steve Kloves is at times witty, and at other times flat and almost demeaning to the audience.  There is a scene where Harry is trying to pluck up the courage to ask a girl on a date and he says, \"Right now, I think I'd rather take on a Dragon.\" That line almost destroys the beauty of these scenes of growing hormones and awkard feelings.  The fact that Harry is more frightened by asking a girl to the ball than battling a dragon provides the biggest piece of poignancy to the film and to have it force fed to us is most insulting to the intelligence of the audience.  These are just minor quibbles however, for 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' remains a worthy and strong chapter in the series.  However, after four films, 'Goblet' would have to rank in at the bottom.",

This whole movie is complain brags. \nNot even Robert Pattinson can save this movie. I mean sure, he's hot, but he's just not pale and dead enough (although, they do try.)

It's just too bad that Newell's execution at dramatic points is not as good as Cuaron's. The acting is as good as ever with everyone in fine form especially Fiennes in a powerful part. Rowling's charming storytelling is still alive and well, but the characters have grown in this chapter. This causes more teenage hormones to come out, which plays against the dark, ominous fantasy. Newell does not combine the two well, so the two become uneven and lack balance. Newell gives a good effort, but he simply lacks the power of Cuaron's previous storytelling.",

The story is about Harry and his friends who are back to school but they have new expectations because every four years, Hogwarts has a tournament choosing one of their students and challenging him or her along with two students from one separate school each who all should be 17 or above and they must face three extremely dangerous tasks known as the Triwizard Tournament. After the three wizards are chosen, when Harry's name arrives out of the goblet, everyone turns on him as if he's a cheat and also he's not even 17 yet but since there is no other choice, Harry as a fourth champion must compete in the Triwizard Tournament. Worse than that, there is terror waiting for him at the very end of the third task. I guess the critics liked this movie the second least after because Mike Newell took helm of the franchise, this movie is much more grittier than the future Harry Potter movies, even more than Deathly Hallows Part 2 says something and who can forget the time when this movie introduced us to the most famous Twilight reject, Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory?

The only thing I didn't like was a failed attempt at driving the group a part as they grow older.  By group I mean Ron, Hermione and Harry.  Yes there are hints of upcoming love triangles and relationships but I wish we could have seen more of the three in action together than we saw of them separated.  Ron and Hermione pretty much sat this movie out.  Granted, it is all about Harry and the magician competition, but still, this series thrives when the three work together.  There was more great special effects with all the magic at use, and we finally get to see other schools come into play.  I hope to see better character integration in the upcoming fifth flick!",

            "content": "Why did Barty Crouch Jr. enter Harry in the Tri-Wizard Tournament if his plan was simply to get him to a portkey to where he could be taken to the graveyard? If portkeys can be made out of anything from a magical trophy to a \"manky old boot\" than how hard is it to make one out of anything like a textbook, give it to Harry in some private location at school, send him to the graveyard then, and not risk him dying in a tournament? Keep in mind that if any of his elaborate set ups went askew in any one way it would destroy his entire plan in an instant. If we're working under the logic that Barty Crouch Jr. had to incorporate Harry's disappearance within the Tournament, then why not just make a portkey out of the golden dragon egg from the first challenge and still finish his plan months earlier than he would otherwise? Why stretch this plan out for a whole year when the objective is that simple? How was the Tournament important anyway? Why didn't the director bother showing any footage of the professional Quidditch game when its the movie's only opportunity to show Quidditch in this movie? What was the point of the Death Eaters attacking the Quidditch World Cup, and then send the Dark Mark into the sky to prove they were Voldemort's followers? Wouldn't something like that raise a lot of concern about hosting the Tri-Wizard Tournament, which for some reason was necessary for his resurrection plan to work? Wouldn't it be best if Voldemort's return was a complete secret? If bringing Voldemort back to power is as easy as dumping his fetus in a potion that only needs flesh, bone and blood to work, then what was the point of the first two movies where his plans for resurrection took a full year? If Professor Quirrell was willing to have him as a tumor on the back of his head, I'm sure he wouldn't mind sacrificing a hand when its apparently very easy to make a new fake one. Why did the ghosts appear from the duel between Harry and Voldemort, and why didn't Dumbledore answer Harry's question about that event instead of rambling on with some weird quote about what's right vs. what's easy? If Harry was allowed to use a summoning charm to summon a broomstick from outside the dragon arena, then why didn't he just use that same spell to draw the egg to him? How was Barty Crouch Jr. gone from his cell in Azkaban for a whole year without anyone noticing he was gone? Keep in mind this story is taking place one year after Sirius Black became the first person ever to escape. Shouldn't the dementors have been taking extra precautions this whole time? How did Hedwig know where to find Sirius Black if he's constantly running from the aurors? Why did Dumbledore have candy in his office that tries to bit you when you eat it? Why didn't Harry care at all when he found out Snape was a Death Eater? Why did Barty Crouch Jr. start running out of the room after Karkaroff accused him of being a death eater? Wouldn't trying to escape and screaming at his dad like a sociopath only prove he was evil? Why not just stand there and say you didn't know what he was talking about? Considering how important his dad is, I think the Ministry would take his word over a convicted death eater, unless said person starts running away and screaming. If Barty Crouch Sr. is the Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation, then why was he like a judge or something at the hearing when Igor Karkaroff was telling them names of the Death Eaters? What was the point of finding Barty Crouch Sr's. dead body in the woods? And why was Harry walking so far away from Ron, Hagrid and Hermione when he found it? Why were they walking in the woods anyway? If Mad-Eye Moody was actually Barty Crouch Jr. in disguise, then why did his fake magical eye actually work? If Barty Crouch Jr. was somehow able to sneak into Snape's private stores and steal the ingredients for Polyjuice potion, then why didn't he also steal Gillyweed instead of relying on Neville to find it and hope he was successful? Snape obviously had Gillyweed in his cellar because later in the movie he accused Harry of stealing it himself. If the contestants had to swim for an hour in the lake to find their underwater friends, then how come when they resurfaced they were back at the start? If Barty Crouch Jr. was somehow able to find Viktor Krum in that giant maze and bewitch Krum with the Imperious Curse, then why didn't he also bewitch Cedric and Fleur to make sure they lost? Keeping in mind once again that if Cedric grabbed the Tri-Wizard Cup first when the maze was collapsing, this whole plan would've been ruined. One more thing...WHAT WAS THAT STUPID ROCK 'N ROLL CONCERT AT THE END OF THE YULE BALL?!Anyway, it's an okay movie. I hope you all enjoy it!!",

This is a technical masterpiece like the rest of the series but what makes this one stand out from the rest is the genious narrative. The triwizard tournament is a great way to show off the fantastical and magical world of Harry Potter. We see mermaids, dragons, a living labyrinth, an amazing wand duel between Voldemort and Harry, the quidditch world cup. Everything is simply blown out to the max. I love fantasy and they succesfully  cramped in all the magical elements into one movie. It still has the great acting, fantastic script, developes the characters even further, the great effects are still here. Everything just works. I can rewatch this film every week and never get tired of it. I adore this film to no end and words can`t describe how amazing this film is in my eyes. The soundtrack is beautiful as every other Harry Potter film. The character arks and plotlines are also some of the best in the Harry Potter series, I am simply overwhelmed by this film. You need to watch it!",

We meet Voldemort in his full functioning body for the first time, and he is more powerful and menacing than ever. It is here he begins his rise in his return as the dark lord, and everyone is more frightened than ever before, so much so that some will pretend it isn't happening. This marks his official return, and will go undefeated until the final films. The scope of this movie is very epic. the triwizard tournament was done quite well, the plot, while the book was long, was well put together, and didn't skip anything too important. The characters are still as good as ever as development continues, and action sequences are great with top notch special effects. Well done.",

However, more credit has to go to Alan Rickman as Snape. Dumbledore on the other hand was atrocious. Michael Gambon may be a fine actor but he just isn't Dumbledore, for me.  The film is also missing certain key elements that made the book. I understand that for the obvious reasons such as time management, certain elements have to be omitted, but this really did take the cake. Why alter scenes which aren't vital to the book, such as the way that the first task played out, and then cut what makes the books great. *Spoilers*One thing that really wound me up was the change in who gave Harry the Gilliweed. Come on! I know Neville's gonna become a key figure later on, but don't cutt Dobby out because of that. Now mentioning Dobby where the hell is he and WINKY!!! Not to mention the older Weasley brother's, Bill and Charlie. How the hell are they going to explain  Fleur and Bill getting together when they didn't even have their first meeting. Those changes really were pointless. Anyway, when viewed as a movie in its own right the Goblet of Fire is enjoyable, as well as the two new boys that are such eye candy. Stanislav Ianevski = YUM!.",

What I also loved about the movie is that it is also one of the funniest in the franchise as well even though the movie becomes really dark in several moments. Being the fourth in the franchise, the filmmakers manage once again to put together another really excellent sequel that doesn't feel bland or unoriginal whatsoever and it really shows throughout that it has real blood going through its veins.",

I mean it just did one of the main scenes that could of been alittle shorter or atleased just alittle more interesting. That scene was the ball scene. Now one thing I did like about this scene and this film is the fact that it did have amaseing teenage love in it and this scene in particular really does show that but not only this scene also lots of other scenes did the same thing. If only they would of just made these scenes and some other scenes in this film more interesting cause these scenes are throught this film. I wouldn't have an issue with these scenes if they just had more. But overall this film is a very teenageish relationship film wich I love cause this is there 4th year so it's very expected that was perfectly I just thought it was boring. But one thing I can say was amaseing is the action of the games. I mean they were just awsome and really couldn't be better and they were also interesting wich dosent happen that often with most action scenes in most movies. But other than that I also liked SPOILAR! The return of lord Voldemort. That also was very awsome and just very well done. Not one thing I can say is Voldemort is I think much more interesting in the films in this series up ahead but for his first appearance in human for well it was awsome. I was impressed. So in the end I did enjoy this film but it was one of the more boring films so far but in the action scenes of this film well they really payed off and were just awsome. But deffinatly a grate part of this franchise. But it wasn't better than two and three because it wasn't as interesting in my oppinion. But grate film just not the best I think.",

Before he can think too much about it, however, Harry boards the train to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he will attend his fourth year of magical education. Shortly after his reunion with his best friends, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), Harry is introduced to yet another Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher: the grizzled Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), a former dark wizard catcher who agreed to take on the infamous \"DADA\" professorship as a personal favor to Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). Of course, Harry's wishes for an uneventful school year are almost immediately shattered when he is unexpectedly chosen, along with fellow student Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson), as Hogwarts' representative in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, which awards whoever completes three magical tasks the most skillfully with a thousand-galleon purse and the admiration of the international wizard community. As difficult as it is to deal with his schoolwork, friendships, and the tournament at the same time (not to mention his feelings toward the ever unfathomable Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), Harry doesn't realize that the most feared wizard in the world, Lord Voldemort, is anticipating the tournament, as well. ~ Tracie Cooper, Rovi",

That being said, Harry/Ron/Hermione's relationships with one another get far deeper which is kind of necessary at this point in the series.\n\nThis is the first film NOT to feature a quiddich scene. This is also the first film to have a composer other than John Williams. The music is by Patrick Doyle who does a good job but he is no John Williams. Again, as the film series is getting more complex, it makes sense to have slightly darker themes so perhaps this switch away from the joyous music of Williams is a good thing.\n\nThis film doesn't match the spectacle of the previous films.",

But this film has bigger problems than his three predecessors. The characters are quite forgettable (only Mad Eye Moddy stands out but only due to its costume), the pacing issue returns which is not surprising for a rushed film, it attempts to replicate Cuar\u00f3n's balance of whimsical and dark but it just fails in the whimsical side, the plot holes are magnified, and the story is the most meaningless for the rest of the saga, I mean the whole story isn't necessary and will never be mentioned again as the point of this film is its ending, but the road to get there feels disconnected. \n\n\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" is the most action oriented film of the saga and the turning point from whimsical to dark territory for the rest of the franchise. It may not be the most well written film of the saga nor the smartest or even the most memorable, but it is undeniably the most exciting of the bunch and arguably the most rewatchable. A highly entertaining blockbuster that solidly ends the first half of the saga.",

It was a real thriller, and it goes to show how Harry and his friends have matured over the course of four movies/years.  After facing Voldemort in broken forms, and Voldemort's followers, Harry finds himself thrown into a legendary tournament of dangerous proportions, where you take on three suicidal-sounding tasks, AKA The Tri-Wizard Tournament (Easier, and less lethal than the Hunger Games, but smaller too).  Very thrilling, very PG-13.  Why do I like this one less than the first three before it?  Because it got a little too dark for my taste.  Don't get me wrong, I like a little darkness in my movies.  Makes it more dramatic.  This one not only saw John Williams leave the series as the composer of the soundtrack after three movies (I blame Revenge of the Sith, and have nothing against Patrick Doyle) but it also saw Harry Potter get more disturbing imagery as well.  No spoilers, but it may get a little scary towards the end.  Overall, great movie, and opening to the next four parts to come.",

This isn't detrimental in any way, however, as it makes for a tight, clean storyline that moves at a much quicker pace.  The kids have had a chance to stretch their acting muscles, and it shows.  Their performances get better with each film, and they can almost be taken as seriously as the experienced actors that surround them (but not quite).  The best part of this one is the perfectly cast Ralph Fiennes, who plays a convincing Lord Voldemort.  I have never seen him in a role that I dislike (I wisely avoided Maid in Manhattan), and who better to portray the ultimate incarnation of magical darkness than the guy who played Amon Goeth?",

There are definitely some entertaining moments- the Yule Ball scenes come to mind, as well as the chilling finale- but the acting is not as strong as it could've been (don't even get me started on Angry!

        {
            "content": "I remember to this day the feeling I had sitting down in the theater to watch Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Back then, I loved all three of the first films equally, and thought the series was right up there with Star Wars as one of the best film franchises of all time. Oh, how naive I was. But this was the movie with which I began to understand just why this series sucks, and why none of these films are worthy of the acclaim they receive. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this movie is up there with Man of Steal Your Money and Up as a life-changing experience for me. It solidifies everything bad about the series without bothering to maintain any of the remarkably good traits held by the third installment. In the chronological order of HP films, this is the first one that I can safely say I never liked. \n\nHaving not grown up with this movie, my hatred for it is free and unfettered, and not tethered down by nostalgia. So: Let us begin. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is, in short, one of the worst movies of all time and probably in the top ten most painful moviegoing experiences I've ever had. I had been waiting for years to see my favorite childhood characters realized on the big screen, and guess what? I'M STILL WAITING! In this pitiful installment, Harry returns to Hogwarts for another year of learning literally nothing, and finds that a massive tournament that was never mentioned before in any of the previous films is suddenly going on with two other schools. The other schools arrive, apparently taking the whole year off just for this, and the tournament begins.\n\nIn this contest, three wizards/witches are selected from the schools by placing their names into the Goblet of Fire (hence the film's title) and being chosen to represent their school. However, as it always does, shit hits the fan in Hogwarts. In addition to the other three contestants, Harry's name is selected randomly. Instead of just saying \"Aaaah, fuck it,\" Dumbledore insists that Harry must now participate because the goblet forms an unbreakable bond... or something. Honestly, I couldn't care less about picking this plot apart, because it's based on a book that I love. But it's handled incredibly poorly here. The exposition delivered by Mad-Eye Moody sticks with me to this day (\"Only an extremely powerful confucius charm or whatever could have done this!\"). Ugh. Somebody actually wrote this thing?\n\nAlso, it has the added bonus of including good ol' Shovel Face from the Twilight saga as Cedric Diggory, the REAL contestant from Hogwarts. I feel bad for Robert Pattinson, because I think he's gotten a bad rap from Twilight (and he thoroughly regrets being in it), but I'm sorry, the guy cannot act to save his life. He and Radcliffe were made for each other-- the scenes where they interact are simply laughable. Throw in an annoying reporter from FOX news and Stupert Grint's dumb \"confused face,\" and you have yourself a winning cast. The movie does hit some occasional high notes with Brendan Gleeson and Alan Rickman (\"Don't... lie... to me\"), but once you realize that these are some highly esteemed actors who have been reduced to spouting gibberish, you'll start to understand why I hate this movie so much.\n\nIn addition to the acting flaws, there is a scene at a school dance that lasts for a good half-hour, during which absolutely nothing of interest happens and the movie tries to convince us that even wizards have awkward teen years. God, fucking kill me already. This movie is nearly three hours long, and for some reason the director felt the need to pad the run time with additional scenes that aren't even in the book. I'm not saying you have to adhere to the books completely, but Jesus Christ, if you want to hold my interest for such a long period of time, you'd better have a plausible reason for me to stay in my seat. I recall wanting to walk out on this movie at around this point, but couldn't (as I was seven years old).\n\nFinal Score for Harry Potter and the Anus of Fire: 1/10 stars. The only reason this movie doesn't score any lower is because I want to set it apart from the other four films, all of which are infinitely worse. This movie marks a turning point for this franchise, where it went from being simply bad to horrifically bad. I can only imagine the look of terror and befuddlement that must have petrified itself on my face while watching this absolute abomination unto cinema. This movie doesn't just rape my childhood, it sets a STANDARD for raping my childhood, and ushers in the second half of the movies, which continue to FUCK MY CHILDHOOD'S DEAD FUCKING CORPSE!!! AAARRGH!!! THIS MOVIE MAKES ME SO MAD! And then Voldemort comes back, and he looks like post-nose job Michael Jackson?!?!?! This is not the movie that fans of this franchise were looking forward to! How can any God-fearing Harry Potter fan justify liking this massive piece of shit? WHY AM I RELIVING THIS SOUL-CRUSHING EXPERIENCE BY WRITING THIS REVIEW?\n\nFuck... only halfway through this review series, and I've already had a complete mental breakdown. This was not a good idea. Still, Emma Watson is finally hot. +1 (and I'm sixteen, so don't go yelling \"PEDOBEAR\" just yet).\n\nSTAY TUNED FOR THE FIFTH INSTALLMENT OF THIS SPECIAL EDITION OF TUT'S TUTILLATING REVIEWS: HARRY POTTER AND THE RAPE OF MY CHILDHOOD!

The novels were never meant to adapt faithfully given their pop ambiance, and I've no problem in a director inserting their relevant spin, but when it becomes mired in capitalistic interests, as with this version, it alienates one from the franchise. I don't think I cared or payed attention much to the sequels following this one, for example, as evidently none of the primetime subject matter would be translated. And this one was moderately dark in origin, but still would've been interesting to see it given its due. Horribly miscast Radcliffe has always stood out as the unconvincing type among his two proficient peers anyway, and playing the waiting game for two years between each film just to await another \"To be continued...\" was getting pretty pointless. The one good thing about the other HPs usually condemned in cinema (Style over substance) is just as fun seeing toyed with here, and the international angle beckoning foreign actors adds a little more distinction, but Goblet of Fire is best left for the HP fanatics.",

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an exciting and thrilling adventure full of action, mystery, and terror.",

            "content": "Being an adaptation of the Harry Potter book with probably the most material to work with, Goblet of Fire had a lot of work on its hands to include and cut out just the right amount to make an engrossing film. Although one-time director Mike Newell succeeds for the most part, they might have tried to put a little too much in here. It's not the best in the series, but it isn't bad either.\n\n    After the dark and gloomy approach of the third installment (Prisoner of Azkaban) worked so well, the movie makers took it too heart. This movie starts off with a shot of a bunch of skulls and a snake coming out from one one of them. It only gets worse from there. This is easily the darkest Harry Potter, full of murky lighting, foggy scenery, and creepy music. Luckily, it fits the dark and twisting plot well.\n\n    This time around, three wizarding schools are having a tournament where three chosen contenders must compete for the Triwizard cup. And, of course, Harry's name mysteriously also is chosen, making him the fourth contender (called champions here). Who put his name in the Goblet of Fire? The plot thickens. Just like the excellent third movie, this film is full of twists and turns, most of which that you can't see coming (unless you've read the book, of course). It's one of the more interesting plots in the series, but it is unfortunately brought down by the only big problem with the movie.\n\n     Considering the book of which this movie is based is full of subplots, they had to be very careful what to cut out and what to keep. Although they did cut some things completely, like Hermione fighting for house-elf rights (good thing that wasn't in here), many things they started but did not truly wrap up. For instance, Rita Skeeter is introduced, but is never really wrapped up appropriately like she was in the novel. Also, we see Barty Crouch lying in the woods (dead?), but this is never explained either. And don't even get me started on the Moaning Myrtle in the bathtub scene. If they were willing to cut some of the extra things out, this could have been a better movie. \n\n      Besides this glaring problem, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a good movie with plenty of excitement (specifically to do with the fight with the dragon). The acting is not a huge problem in this one, the special effects are great, and we get to see (SPOILER) Lord Voldemort for the first time. If only they could tighten the plot, this would be a great film. Even still, it's a good one. \n\nMy one question: Why does everyone have long hair?",

            "content": "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth installment in the Harry Potter movie and book series and Mike Newell sits in the director's chair this time around. A tri-wizard tournament, a game where three students from wizarding schools around the globe must each face three deadly events, is taking place in Hogwarts. All seems good and well after three champions are chosen until Harry is mentioned as a fourth champion, who is underage to participate in the tournament, and must represent Hogwarts alongside Cedric Diggory while trying to find out who entered him in the tournament. Yet again, like the other Harry Potter movies, John Williams makes a fantastic contribution to the movie with his brilliant music along with the help of Patrick Doyle. The music really fits the mood of each scene and does a brilliant job of making each scene more emotional than it already is. One of the greatest things about Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the performances as we see Harry, Ron and Hermione grow up and mature as the movies go on. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson improve their performances as each movie goes on and Twilight fans may be happy to see Robert Pattinson play Cedric Diggory, another Hogwarts champion. The performances from the cast were solid throughout, there's not one bad thing I could say about any of the actors or actresses as they all depicted their characters perfectly. The characters in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire are brilliant and the movie really captures the personality of the characters in the book very well. As well as this being the start of when the Harry Potter franchise turns very dark and the characters start to grow up from children to teenagers, children will still like this for the magic and the humour, which once again lights up a little from the darkness of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography and camerawork involved in making Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is absolutely phenomenal as it's beautifully shot involving fantastic special effects and breath-taking locations. The creatures involved in the movie are great to look at and look very realistic, which adds to the wonder and imagination of this magical world. Chris Columbus had directed the first two Harry Potter years and Alfonso Cuaron directed the third (which is considered to be a favourite among Potter fans) but I think that Mike Newell did a magnificent job in directing this movie and from making a book adaptation stand out so well as a movie and an adaptation of the book. Although there is three things I am disappointed about and that is that Winky (a house-elf from the book) is not in the movie at all and Hermione doesn't do her campaign, S.P.E.W, which was a movement to gain basic rights for house-elves and I thought it was an important part of her character. I also thought that Albus Dumbledore didn't behave correctly like he did in the books, he was wise, calm and rational but in the movie, he was more angry. Except for those minor details, I believe that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was a great movie and is definitely a very welcome addition to the movie series.\r\n\r\nEven though there's a few things missing from the book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a great adaptation and really captures the feeling and the mood of the book. It's unfortunate that there's sub-plots missing because, as a price, the character development and parts of the story were missing too. For me, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix are my favourite books and I think that the cast and crew have done a terrific job in making Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. As the books go darker and more mature, so do the movies, however this could mean that some of the scenes in the movie might be too scary for a younger audience. If you want an adaptation that is one-hundred percent faithful to the book, then you will be disappointed as even though this is quite faithful, there's a few things missing. However, if you're a Potter fan and you like the movies for what they are, then this is for you.",

One of the most action packed in the series and still follows a darker theme first set by Prisoner of Azkaban. The characters were incredibly portrayed as they were able to show their growth from being kids to young adults. Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort was terrific, definitely a scene-stealer!! \n\nI know that they can't put everything in the film and I have accepted that.  But, I was still a bit disappointed when they cut out the scenes at the Hospital Wing where there was a huge confrontation with the Minister of Magic. It shows the parting of the ways between the Ministry and Dumbledore and mark the start of a great magical war.\n\nThat aside, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has a lot to of fun adventure, humor and  suspense making it a pretty  awesome fantasy film!",

            "content": "Harry Potter is one of the best movie series ever! Harry Potter dreams of an elderly man, Frank Bryce, who overhears Lord Voldemort discussing plans with Peter \"Wormtail\" Pettigrew and Barty Crouch Jr. Frank is then killed by Voldemort. The Quidditch World Cup allows Harry to take his mind off his nightmares until followers of Voldemort known as Death Eaters terrorize the spectators' campsites after the match, and Crouch Jr. summons the Dark Mark, a sign showing that Voldemort is returning to power. At Hogwarts, headmaster Albus Dumbledore introduces ex-Auror Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. In their first Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson, the students learn of the three Unforgivable Curses. The Imperius Curse causes absence of free will, the Cruciatus Curse causes unbearable pain, and the final curse, Avada Kedavra, causes death. Dumbledore announces that the school will host the Triwizard Tournament, in which one wizard from each of the three magical schools competes in three challenges. The champions are selected by the Goblet of Fire, a magical cup into which the candidates' names are placed. Fred and George attempt to enter using an aging potion as no one under 17 can enter. This fails miserably. Cedric Diggory, a student from the House of Hufflepuff, is chosen to represent Hogwarts, Viktor Krum is chosen to represent Durmstrang Institute, and Fleur Delacour is selected to represent Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. The Goblet unexpectedly chooses a fourth champion: Harry. As Harry is underage and should have been ineligible to compete, Hogwarts teachers and students grow suspicious, and the feat drives Ron and Harry apart. The teachers want Dumbledore to pull Harry out of the tournament, but the four champions are bound by a magical contract and therefore Dumbledore has no choice and Harry must compete. For the first task of the Triwizard Tournament, each of the champions must retrieve a golden egg guarded by a dragon. Mad-Eye advises Harry to use his talent for flying to overcome the dragon. Harry enters the first task and summons his broomstick to retrieve the egg, which contains information about the second challenge. The students are soon informed of the Yule Ball, a Christmas Eve ball held during the Triwizard Tournament. Ron and Harry have trouble finding dates to the ball and when they find out that Hermione is attending with Viktor Krum, Ron becomes jealous. In exchange for previous aid, Cedric provides Harry with a clue that prompts him to open the egg underwater. With help from Moaning Myrtle, he learns that the second task entails the retrieval of \"something precious\" to each of the competitors from the nearby Black Lake, where there are mermaids. While preparing for the task, Neville Longbottom provides Harry with Gillyweed, enabling him to breathe underwater for one hour. Harry is the first to arrive at the location, and finds Ron, Hermione, Cho Chang and Fleur's sister, Gabrielle, in suspended animation. Finishing last after attempting to free Ron and Gabrielle, Harry is awarded second place for \"outstanding moral fiber\", behind Cedric. Following an exchange with Mad-Eye, Ministry official Barty Crouch, Sr. is found dead by Harry shortly after the second task. While waiting in Dumbledore's office, Harry's curiosity leads him to look into Dumbledore's pensieve, causing him to revisit one of Dumbledore's memories. He witnesses a trial before the Wizengamot in which captured Death Eater Igor Karkaroff, the current headmaster of Durmstrang, denounces a number of Death Eaters, including both Severus Snape and Barty Crouch Jr. While Dumbledore vouches for Snape's integrity, Crouch Sr. is horrified at this revelation and disowns his maniacal son, sending him to Azkaban. Upon returning to the present time, Dumbledore tells Harry that he is searching his memories for a clue as to why extraordinary events have taken place at Hogwarts since the start of the tournament. In the Triwizard Tournament's third and final task, the competitors are placed inside a hedge maze; their challenge is to reach the Triwizard Cup. Krum, acting under the Imperius curse, incapacitates Fleur and attempts to do the same to Cedric. Harry stops Cedric from attacking Krum, and the two run for the cup. When Cedric is trapped by vines, Harry frees him and the two claim a draw and grab hold of the cup together. The cup, which is a Portkey, transports the two champions to a graveyard where Wormtail and Voldemort are waiting for Harry. Wormtail murders Cedric, traps Harry, then performs a ritual that rejuvenates Voldemort, who then summons the Death Eaters (which includes Draco's father, Lucius) and bids them to witness a duel between their Dark Lord and his nemesis. As Harry, who is tortured by Voldemort, fights him, a connection called Priori Incantatem occurs between their wands. Harry's wand forces Voldemort's to disgorge the spirits of the people Voldemort has most recently murdered, including Harry's parents, Frank Bryce and Cedric. Harry is briefly protected by the spirits and escapes with Cedric's body (as his request) using the cup. Upon his return, Harry tells Dumbledore and Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge that Voldemort has returned and is responsible for Cedric's death. That's the plot, and it's an amazing movie, full of action, adventure, and more, highly recommend.",

            "content": "In Which Doctor Who Returns Amon Goeth to Power  \r\n\r\nI understand why they took out the whole house elf subplot.  And to be honest, SPEW got kind of annoying in places in the books.  But I think some of the changes in this one only served to make the later movies a bit more confusing to people who hadn't read the books.  No, we didn't necessarily need to know that Fleur Delacour (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy) was part veela; we didn't even need to know what veela are.  (Though you can find out by checking Wikipedia, and no, not just [i]Harry Potter[/i] entries.)  But was there a reason that the Weasley family plus guests are in the nosebleed seats at the Quidditch World Cup instead of being in the Top Box?  Other than to give Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) another reason to sneer, of course.  Which he doesn't need, because he certainly found enough other reasons elsewhere in the story.  It also leaves out important character development for two other people who either are or are supposed to be in that box, meaning other plot is changed for no good reason.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is back for his fourth year at Hogwarts.  This year, Hogwarts will be hosting that ancient tradition, the Triwizard Tournament.  Students from the three great Wizarding schools of Europe will compete for the Triwizard Cup, and because no one under seventeen will be permitted to compete, Harry is quite looking forward to letting someone else face danger for a change.  Alas, the Goblet of Fire, which chooses the schools' champions, has been fooled into choosing Harry as a champion--and since putting your name in the Goblet is a binding magical contract, Harry must compete.  He is up against Fleur of Beauxbatons, Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianseki) of Durmstrang, and Cedric Diggory (That Poor Boy), who had hoped to finally give Hufflepuff a chance for glory.  Watching over him, among the old familiar faces, is this year's new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson).\r\n\r\nYou know, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n apparently worked to convince Mike Newell that he could do the whole story in a single movie, and I don't think he did anyone any favours by it.  A lot of people were awfully smug about how the division of the seventh book into two movies was about money, but that simply wasn't the case.  Or anyway it wasn't the whole case.  The books, starting with this one, have a lot of story in them.  As I said, we [i]do[/i] leave out the whole SPEW subplot.  No one is credited as Ludo Bagman.  The Weasley twins (James and Oliver Phelps) lost a lot of plot development, and Percy simply isn't in the movie at all.  And Ron (Rupert Phelps) loses a lot of character development over the course of the series, much of which is in this segment of the story.  His relationship with Hermione (Emma Watson) loses some, but perhaps most of all is his relationship with Harry.  After all, for once, he had no reason to believe that Harry was going to upstage him, but it happened again.\r\n\r\nThe other really irritating thing is that it is yet another installment of the series where plot gives way in part for a too-long action sequence.  This seems to have been a fundamental misunderstanding on the part of someone; these aren't particularly action stories.  Never have been.  Things happen, but the things which happen aren't the most important part.  Many of the action scenes in the book take only a few pages; some of the practical precautions in them get ignored.  (In this case, the fact that the dragons are chained down so they don't, say, chase one of the students all over the area and get completely loose.)  The stories are about a boy's journey into manhood that just happens to be paired with a magical quest.  The stories are about people, not actions, and the movies have consistently missed that, though none of them quite so badly as [i]Chamber of Secrets[/i].  And indeed, that's part of why they worked so hard on the casting, which includes the majority of the great British actors.\r\n\r\nDyllan, who is currently a member--I kid you not--of his college's Quidditch team, wanted to be in these movies.  Desperately.  And because he's an actor, a lot of people would think he would have had a chance, at least as being one of the people wandering the halls of Hogwarts somewhere in the background.  However, it wasn't going to happen.  Similarly, IMDb is wrong when it suggests that people thought they were considering John Malkovich as Lord Voldemort.  Rowan Atkinson, possibly (though he wouldn't have done as well as Ralph Fiennes), but not John Malkovich.  Almost the entire cast of the movie was born somewhere in the British Isles, and if the actor wasn't, it was because the character wasn't.  For example, Predrag Bjelac, who played Karkaroff, was born in Belgrade.  But no, neither Dyllan nor John Malkovich ever had a chance.  And I'm quite pleased by that fact.  It's the thing the movies inarguably did right, even if this one features neither Dursleys nor Mrs. Weasley.",

While the absence of the Quidditch match in the beginning of the film is a little disappointing, the Triwizard Tournament more than makes up for it: it's easily the most exciting, tense, and downright amazing premise the world of Hogwarts has to offer. If that wasn't enough, the ending proves to be one of the most heart wrenching and epic finales of any fantasy film to date, complemented by stunning visual effects and a beautiful soundtrack (the rendition of Hedwig's theme for the opening titles still gives me chills to this day). While many won't recognize this as the best of the series, I believe that it takes the cake, with Deathly Hallows - Part 2 a close second. What an incredible fantasy film.",

            "content": "Well, here I am reviewing another Harry Potter film- Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - trying to narrow down what makes them so entertaining.  Is it the story?  For while the story for the first film was a bit weak, they've certainly improved as the series continues.  Is it the characters?  I can complain all I like about how little screen time some of them get (and indeed, this problem plagues this chapter as well), but those complaints do stem from a love for the characters in the film.  Of course, there is the music, the visuals, and the storybook feel that all of the films seem to possess.  Flaws aside, the Harry Potter films have given me many reasons to return to Hogwarts, and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is no exception.\n\nThe students of Hogwarts are anticipating the Triwizard Tournament, though they are dismayed that students under the age of 17 are not permitted to enter the tournament.  Despite this, Harry Potter is somehow selected to compete- even though he is not of the appropriate age.  A mystery now surrounds the tournament, and it's important that it be solved before any harm comes to Hogwarts.\n\nEverything that has made the previous films so enjoyable is here in this film.  The characters are just as loveable as ever, and the new additions (specifically Rita Skeeter and Mad-Eye Moody) are excellent.  The visual effects are fantastic, and the overall story continues to develop.\n\nThere truly isn't much more to say that I haven't already said in my previous reviews of the Potter films.  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is entertaining, well made, often exciting, often funny, and occasionally magical.\n\nThe acting is well done.  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are growing more and more at home in their roles as Harry, Ron, and Hermione respectively.  Brendan Gleeson is fantastic as Mad-Eye Moody, and Miranda Richardson is hilarious as Rita Skeeter.\n\nThe most worthy of note, however, may just be the music, composed by Patrick Doyle.  While John Williams scored the previous three films, a change in composer still seemed like a refreshing idea.  And Doyle's score might just be the best Potter score thus far.  With a strikingly beautiful arrangement of Hedwig's theme at the very beginning, and many memorable cues that even those not listening to the score should notice, Doyle's score is a breath of fresh air from the already superb work by Williams.  The only problem that some might have, is that many of Williams themes are underused or omitted entirely, but Doyle's new additions to the score easily make up for this.\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is fun, but also has substantial depth.  A delight to watch, and just as wonderful to listen to, this is exceptional fantasy entertainment.",

But there is also a plenty of humor that works against more serious and poignant moments. It is superbly crafted and the set pieces are quite impressive, but the thing that makes this franchise special, timeless, and compelling is the characters. This is a franchise that evolves as its characters mature, and it makes it relatable for the audiences. It's kind of brilliant.",

But still I love this outing. \"I Love Magic\" Harry utters as he arrives at the Quidditch World Cup with 5 of the Weasleys and Hermione and sees at best a two person tent. However, inside are 4 bed areas, a kitchen, a dining area and a living area. And don't we all love it. This was has dragons, killer merpeople, a little sexual tension as these high schoolers mature to the point where they are completely aware thank girls are girls and boys are boys. The tension between Ron and Hermione that has been hinted at since the end of the first flick(awkward handshake anyone) is on full display here. As is a row between Ron and his famous Best friend. FIRE also has the distinction of introducing the world to Robert Pattinson as big man on campus Cedric Diggory and more importantly introduced the world the fully resurrected Lord Voldermort played with giddy menace by Ralph Finnes. Action packed, humorous and also featuring the first in many shocking deaths to come. Harry just keeps on getting on better.",

Previously in Potter universe, we've had some great Sherlock Holmes style invetsigations occurring such as, who really is Sirius Black and how do you get into the Chamber of Secrets. This was perfectly acceptable but the continous regime was beginning to become repeitive. Don't get me wrong, Iam a big mystery solver/who dunnit fan but Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire's action and entertainment aspects were what made it so delightful and intriguing to watch.\r\n\r\nThe movies pace is so fast that the Dursley's have been axed from its opening and instead we witness a suspeseful if unresolved nightmare from within Harry's head of an old person being killed after glaring at a mysterious alien type figure, a man with a black cloak (David Tennant), Wormtail (Timothy Spall) and a vicious snake.\r\n\r\nImmediatly this sets the scene for some detective work but not before Harry and the gang are attacked by a host of Death Eaters. The man with the black clock (Tennant) then appears on a deserted battlefield some time later, unaware of Harry's presence before disappearing.\r\n\r\nHowever, bigger problems eveolve for Harry when he is unwittingly picked for a tournament under his age limit. He faces a fire breathing dragon in one of three extremely dangerous tasks. \r\n\r\nNot to give too much away, Harry Potter four is the best of the first four movies and a brilliant watch. It evades five stars by the skin of its teeth; there were just a few things the film lacked which I can't quite put my finger on. But nevertheless, open your Gob and either get the DVD or movie tickets; don't throw your hopes in the fire!",

Harry teams up with fellow Hogwarts student Cedric Digory to enroll in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, a round-by-round battle to see who is the best wizard in the three districts of Wizard Schools.  But there's something about this tournament that bothers Harry.  Something that reinvokes his memory of his parents, and reinvigorates his fear of Voldemort also...  the story is driven, purposeful, and well-made.  The movie feels what an adaptation should feel like; taking all of the important parts of the novel, putting it in script format, and make it work on the big screen in the same effective manner.  This film is effective in its portrayal of \"Harry Potter\".  The acting is good, the visual effects are fantastic, and this is by far one of the better adaptations of the \"Harry Potter\" franchise.  Again, the film leaves you with an ending that is dissatisfying and somewhat cliche, but the film also leaves a cliffhanger, making the viewer desperate to find out what will happen next.",

            "content": "Book-wise, i i like it better than the first three, i was even able to get past how Dumbledore didn't realize Voldemort's plot until it was already too late, but movie-wise, not quite as good as the first three. it was entertaining to watch, but it missed much of what i liked in the books, like the scene with the Dursley's at the beginning (always great to see what happens to them in the books), the actual playing of the Quidditch World Cup, and Dumbledore as usual in the books.\r\n\r\nJust like in the first three, great cast with great newcomers (Brendan Gleeson as Moody, Robert Pattison as Cedric, who actually did a great job, mainly at the end when he dies, and the only reason i gave it a 70 and not lower, Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort). I once again dispised the choice of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, but this time, he actually did something that just got me outraged, (although it wasn't until after i read the book and rewatched the movie that i felt this rage, before then, i was fine with it), HE MANHANDLED HARRY. DUMBLEDORE WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO A STUDENT, THERE IS A SCENE IN ORDER OF THE PHOENIX (obviously not in the movie) WHERE UMBRIDGE MANHANDLES A STUDENT AND DUMBLEDORE FINALLY STOPS SMILING AND ZAPS HER IN ANGER!!!!!!!! WHY DID ROWLING PERMIT THAT!!!!!!!! But everyone else was fine.\r\n\r\nI didn't like what they did with the three tasks in the movie, i prefer how it was done in the book better\r\n\r\nin the first task in the book, Harry uses his firebolt to get the dragon to fly, and then ducks down and grab the egg when it was up in the air. I understand why they didn't put it in the movie, but i'm sure they could've came up with a more thrilling, yet believable way of doing it, i mean, the teachers would've done something if the dragon had broken free of it's chain, but no, they wanted to make it look entertaining, not think of a different entertaining sequence.\r\n\r\nin the second task in the book, the egg said the hostages would die to motivate the champions, like they'd actually kill the little 8 year old girl Fleur couldn't save, that's what actually made the scene great, but in the movie, they should've just stuck with the book, because it was actually funny to find that he didn't necessarily have to save the girl.\r\n\r\nthe third task is easily the most messed up of the tasks, if you read the book, it's actually a better, and more dangerous maze than in the movie, instead of the maze walls trying to grab you, there and monsters out there that make it more thrilling, and the end of the third task in the movie was just flat out stupid, in fact, i thought the book did a more dramatic job than the movie on how the two decide to take it together, how the two actually argued with each other on who should take it instead of choosing to do it in order to save both lives.\r\n\r\nThe opening part of the graveyard sequence with Wormtail and the process of turning Voldemort back into Voldemort was scary when i first saw it when it came on DVD, and why not, i was only 8 when i saw it, but after reading the book, i didn't think it was THAT scary compared to how scary it was in the book.\r\n\r\nBut what makes the graveyard sequence so scary in the movie is when we're finally introduced to Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. This is what totally redeems the movie from all of the bagging i've been giving it. This was the moment Fiennes BECAME Voldemort, and the graveyard scene will always be one of the most memorable scenes in the Harry Potter movie series.\r\n\r\ni didn't see it in theaters because of the whole PG-13 thing, but that was around the time when i should just suck it up and do it, so i bought it instead. And shortly afterwards, i read the first six books and had to wait for seven to come out. and i rewatched the first four movies after reading each. This one was OK, but the book was TOTALLY better, and it was Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort that saved the movie for me.",

            "content": "The fourth entry into the Harry Potter Saga is really epic because it's more complex. Hogwarts is visited by other schools to participating in the Triwizard Tournament, a tournament in which each student of their own school gets to participate 3 difficult challenges. They are chosen by the Goblet of Fire. But it seems that the goblet has chosen 4 champions, including Harry Potter. Everybody thinks that Harry put his name on the Goblet, but if it wasn't him, who was? Could Lord Voldemort be up to something? As the film progresses it shows that not everyone is your friend in the magic world. \r\nThe film is like nothing you have ever seen. From the production design, set design, the art direction, the costume design, and the visual effects all of those things are perfect in this movie. The film is bright and yet dark at the same time. Finally after the three movies we get to finally see Lord Voldemort, and he is frightening. The make-up put on this Ralph Fiennes is really impressive, pale like if he was a ghost. I basically love the graveyard scene because we finally get to see the battle between good and evil. Another theme played in this movie is about friendship, how to keep your old friends while making some new friends. I seriously loved the jealously on Ronald's face when Hermione is dancing with another guy. I also love the usual morality of the story about love is beyond death and that nothing can stop love, not even evil. As an entertainment movie is really classic, because I didn't get bored with this movie. The pacing of this movie is really great, fast and it doesn't slow you down. The performance of Brendan Glenson's performance as Professor Mood was cool and funny, especially when he turns Malfoy into a rat. Miranda's performance as Rita Skeeter was also cool and a little bit malevolent in what she wants to write it in her own way. The acting of the kids in this movie was generally better than the previous instalments especially when one of the champions dies and Harry is weeping you feel kind of sad for them. The cinematography worked great in this movie, especially on the scenes of the challenges, it worked really cool. \r\nThere's nothing bad I can say of this movie except there was some things that were left unexplained in the movie.  For example when Harry tells Dumbledore about his confrontation with Voldemort, Dumbledore simply says \"Priori Incantantem\" but he doesn't explain what that is. I know that the book explains it to you but I think Dumbledore in the movie could say something about it. Now I did liked and enjoyed the soundtrack of the movie, but I kind of feel bad that they replaced John Williams. I mean John Williams is one of the greatest composers of all time, and you replacing him from the Harry Potter Franchise are like replacing the lead actors, because John is an important ingredient in this franchise believe it or not. \r\nThe film was directed by Mike Newell and this is his only Harry Potter directed film. He is most famous for this movie. In January 2006, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire surpassed the box office takings of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, to become the eighth highest-grossing film worldwide at the time, and the second highest-grossing film in the Harry Potter series, behind Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. As of July 2011 it is the sixth highest-grossing Harry Potter film behind The Philosopher's Stone, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2. \r\nThe film ranks third in the North American box office behind Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe for 2005, although both films rank lower than Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in worldwide terms.\r\nI recommend this movie to people that love fantasy films, people that enjoy adventure films, to people that love an action-family movie this movie is for you guys. I think this is the best in the Harry Potter franchise because is both colourful and dark. An excitement that would never be forgotten.",

            "content": "The best of the Harry Potter series! Truly an excellent film! Even as we go into the two part 7th and final chapter of the Harry Potter series, I still give the top prize to Mike Newell's Goblet of Fire. Why? This is clearly the definitive moment in the Potter series where the series walks away from being a children's story and transitions into a much darker story, while still delivering more fun and excitement of an epic adventure than any of the other Potter films. The actors in Goblet of Fire give their best and most realistic performances. Harry moves into a deeper and more complex world, the world of dating. Harry Potter, the boy who can fly on broomsticks, fight dragons, battle dark lords, without fear or hesitation. Yet, he is terrified to simply ask a girl to the school's dance. Innocence now begins to fade, dark and difficult are truly approaching. These themes and characteristics are magically well constructed and crafted in the film's story and presentation that I never in a million years expected a Harry Potter film to reach this level of entertainment and this level of brilliant filmmaking. For me this is The Empire Strikes Back of the Harry Potter series. It is a shame that HP 5 and HP 6 didn't even come close to Goblet, now it's up to HP 7. Goblet of Fire reins as the best of the Potter series, and was even one of my top ten films of 2005, and believe me that is saying a lot.",

            "content": "Mike Newell's \"The Goblet of Fire\" is a thrilling, action-packed and moving film that does a satisfactory job of adapting the book. The fourth entry in the \"Harry Potter\" series deviates considerably from the book in terms of content. However, it offers sheer entertainment-value that fans of the novel won't be able to resist. Using gorgeous production values, Newell draws viewers into the three dangerous tasks of the Triwizard Tournament. From the heart-pounding dragon chase to the mesmerizing underwater sequence, the fantastic action sequences raise the stakes considerably. Yet, while \"The Goblet of Fire\" offers plenty of thrilling action, it often loses sight of the story. The script awkwardly rushes past important events in the book, which can at times be confusing for newcomers to the series. That being said, the excellent performances from the cast keep this blockbuster from falling apart. The golden trio- Radcliffe, Watson and Grint- are astonishing and demonstrate how far they have matured as actors. The supporting players- including the scene-stealing Brendan Gleeson- are also perfectly cast and get the chance to shine. At nearly three hours, \"The Goblet of Fire\" is undeniably overlong and often tests the viewer's patience. Nevertheless, fans of the beloved series will definitely enjoy it and so will movie-goers seeking exhilarating entertainment. As a long-time fan of the series, I did not enjoy the movie initially but have come to appreciate it more upon re-viewing. Even if it's not flawless, it's well worth a watch for Potter fans.",

I mean every scene is just pure genius from the music or to the acting, but I just love howintense this film is.  The plot gets darker and better as we watch, and the finale of the film is one of the defining moments of the franchise.  I also love how they are able to make sure these characters are growing up, instead of keeping them as the kids they were in the first three.  The cast gives some of the finest performances I have seen in the franchise, I mean the three main heroes are just mesmorizing in their roles while they handle playing more mature characters now.  I also want to give credit to the three challenges, the dragon scene, the underwater scene, and the maze were all such brilliant filmmaking and I must give credit to the direction for that.

I remember feeling pretty disappointed with every Harry Potter movie after Azkaban, this one especially but in hindsight i was probably being a little too tough on it. My extra years since then on Earth have taught me to just forget the book. The spirit of the source material is all here. Again i must congratulate the majority of the cast - I can't get over Alan Rickman's Snape! Michael Gambon's Albus Dumbledore seems to be too angry and short for my liking though. All of the tasks are quite fun i guess, and i really enjoyed the beginning with the Weasley's. Goblet also sees a hint of teenage hormones blossoming too which is quite amusing, really. Everything here pretty much hits the mark, i guess it's inevitable that i'll cringe at some of the dialogue, and i also feel that i'm somewhat more accommodating towards the more 'off' parts of this, as a fan of the Harry Potter series. In conclusion, The Goblet of Fire does what it needs to do to move the story along the more darker route and it delivers some great humor with it too. As expected the majority of the supporting cast are just a pleasure to watch as they interact with each other but i can't help but feel that Daniel Radcliffe & Rupert Grint are perhaps the weakest links at times.",

Highlights include the First Task with the Firebolt, the introduction to the Quidditch match and the final graveyard scene.  However, there are still several flaws.  The beginning is far to rushed, perhaps because of the incredible length of the source material.  The Dursleys do not even show up in the film and the Quidditch match is cut abruptly short.  Much of the backstory of different characters are either omitted or underexplained.  When the movie is not in action, it tends to drag a bit, including some rather pointless fillers.  However, once the film reaches the climax, the audience will forget about the flaws and stare mesmerized at the awakening of Lord Voldemort.",

            "content": "Watch out, kids, because this installment is actually rated PG-13, so you know that things are about to get real, something that I'm kind of hoping Harry Potter's hair in this film isn't. No, it's not that bad, but the point is that Harry is really getting into the teen years, and let me tell you, that big head of long hair and a small head doesn't exactly make it easy to take his particular teen problems all that interesting. Well, I don't even know if this supposedly more serious installment in the \"Harry Potter\" saga makes Lord Voldemort all that intimidating, because that killing spell, \"Avada Kedavra\", that he blurts out sounds too much like the trite \"abra cadabra\" sorcerery for him to not silly. Well, in this film, you do actually get to see him in his realized form, and at that point, he's so creepy that I'd be intimidated by him performing \"Witch Doctor\", although that might simply be because Cartoons' cover is scary enough already. No, this film takes itself too seriously for that, so much so that it's starting to take its being British pretty seriously, to the point of going completely crazy and having the audacity to get... [u]a British director[/u]. I mean, at this point, this series only had two directors, so you wouldn't figure that it would be all that big of a deal, but one of those directors was Mexican, and once you're reaching for that group, you must have exhausted searches for the right hands, something that this series definitely found with Mike Newman... for only one film. Oh well, at least they followed him up with David Yates, who, I'm not going to lie, is a much better filmmaker than Newman, for although this film is awesome, Harry's hair and the names of certain killing spells aren't the only things shaking your investment here.\r\n\r\n\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\" saw the formula that this series established starting to water down with its uniqueness, and with this film, familiarity is even more glaring, not so much in the context of a \"Harry Potter\" installment, - seeing as how this is a distinguished, if a touch formulaic point in the saga - but in a general context which sees this drama hitting many of the usual beat and path one might expect a blockbuster of this nature to hit. Still, no matter how familiar, the film stands to associate you more with its narrative, being a little more well-rounded as an ensemble piece, yet still with some underexploration of certain prominent plotting aspects and characters, which at least seem disconcerting because of forced rushing that slam-bangs certain happenings, - particularly others' interpretation on the games and other matters - and thins out some of the layers of this epic. Seeing as how the final product, through all of its underdevelopment and awkward hurried moments, runs well over a hefty runtime of two-and-a-half hours, it might go without saying that this drama tries to make up for attributes that are too tight for their own good, and too much so, shaking focal coherency with filler, - particularly with the near-inconsequential \"Yule Ball\" segment - and getting excessive with material to the point of meandering. There's only so much action to this pseudo-blockbuster, and inspiration certainly makes the film dramatically engrossing when it's a little less than pure, unadulterated fun, but the limited goings-on produce about as much a sense of aimlessness as they do a sense of dramatic thoughtfulness, and that might very well be because the subtlety upon which dramatic value thrives has a tendency to go shaken by subtlety issues. At this point, alone, the series was making near-remarkable progress in putting more edge and maturity to its storytelling, and the final product's being inspired to the point of bona fide dramatic excellence firmly reflects that, but for only so long, as the film can't completely wash away the cheese, not just in filler that sometimes gets to be too, not so much kiddy, but teeny for comfort, but to dramatics that, while never cloying, get kind of heavy-handed in a reflection of overambition. Many have debated the degree to which this film compensates for its messy moments of too much ambition, if not a hint of laziness, with inspiration, and for me, I must admit that the heart placed into the crafting of this effort keeps the final product pumping a long, long way on the whole, but stiffened a bit by familiarity, uneven pacing and subtlety issues which greatly threaten to hold the final product just shy of its final state of quality. Of course, I don't reckon you're in too bad of a place if you fall just short of excellent, and yet, the point is that the final product does, in fact, transcend its shortcomings enough to be the first in this solid saga to achieve excellence, and with no small help from aesthetic value.\r\n\r\nOstensibly looking to explore its British musical roots a little more, this film sees the series abandoning the great John Williams for Scottish composer Patrick Doyle, whose score gets a little too close to Williams' musical themes for the comfort of originality, but still offers plenty of weight that is tonally fitting, with a solid hint of aesthetic value that Roger Pratt expands upon with cinematography that is not only ruggedly handsome in its grit, but sweeping in scale. This scope certainly compliments the grandly well-staged action sequences, in addition to lively visuals that art directors Alan Gilmore, Andrew Ackland-Snow, Neil Lamont, Gary Tomkins, Alexandra Walker, Mark Bartholomew and Alastair Bullock build absolutely lavishly, with the help of intricate set designs by Stuart Craig, lovely costume designs by Jany Temime, and stellar visual effects, many of which aren't simply there for the sheer visceral spectacle that the preceding blockbusters seemed to primarily focus upon as technical triumphs. The effects are just as prominent as the art direction in the building of a distinguished world and the breathing of some life into deeper aspects of this whimsical narrative, yet they aren't quite as directly complimentary to the substance of this drama as the performances, all of which are memorable, with standouts in the supporting cast including the very underused, but effectively antagonistic Ralph Fiennes as the realized form of Lord Voldemort, and the delightfully charismatic and chillingly convincing Brandon Gleeson as an experienced sorcerer whose sanity and moral stances are questionable, while Daniel Radcliffe continues to do about as much as anyone or anything in making an intriguing lead character, with subtle charm and a few endearing dramatic layers. Boasting just as much, if not more stylistic proficiency than any of its predecessors, this film stands out as a blockbuster, alone, with acting that, while not exactly outstanding, helps greatly in placing some substance to go with style, and yet, it's debatable if this film improves upon the aesthetic, technical and acting value from, at the very least, \"The Prisoner of Azkaban\", which wouldn't have been so engrossing if it wasn't so technically sharp and well-acted. In terms of story concept, there was still something a little minimalist about \"The Prisoner of Azkaban\" that kept excellence at bay, thus, it's the narrative that really causes this film to stand out, not just ahead of its predecessors, but as excellent, because even though this story isn't exactly all that original, it is rich with layers of thorough color as an offbeat piece of teen fluff, in addition to liveliness as a portrayal of a competitive game, and, of course, tension as a near-gritty dramatic study on morality and encroaching dangers. Something of an epic, this film's particularly layered story concept carries a lot of potential, and although the execution has its faults in pacing, subtlety and altogether meeting ambition with inspiration, it does such potential a lot of justice more often than not, with Steve Kloves turning in a script whose wit and relatively greater exploration of supporting characters provides a color that director Mike Newell brings to life with very entertainingly brisk pacing, and whose more realized moments of dramatic weight are drawn upon by thoughtfulness to Newell's direction that make the tense aspects biting and the more sentimental aspects genuinely moving. Smoothly flowing from intensity, to considerable resonance, both of which reinforce a sense of consequentiality that in turn defines how far this series had come along in its maturity as an epic saga, the final act particularly excels in this film, but it is not much more than a height in compellingness that stands consistently throughout the final product, backed by a realization that is difficult to fully describe, and establishes enough style and substance to make a final product so entertaining, layered, and dramatically intriguing that it truly stands out.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, formulaic and often underdeveloped storytelling reflects a certain laziness, while certain excesses in storytelling and subtlety issues reflect too great of an ambition to achieve excellence, ultimately secured by colorful scoring, handsome cinematography, thrilling action, immersive art direction and effects, charismatic acting and inspired writing and direction so effective in marrying thorough color with engrossing depth that \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" ultimately stands out as a triumph in blockbuster filmmaking whose entertainment value and dramatic range craft a truly excellent turn for the classic fantasy saga.\r\n\r\n3.5/5 - Excellent",

This is the one Harry Potter movie where too much happens.  This film spits scene after scene at the viewer and expects us to come away satisfied that the story has been furthered.  Also, the performances suffer a bit.  While the acting generally can pull the somewhat weak story up to become something other than a dark picture, this movie just doesn't cut it.  Michael Gambon was unimpressive, Miranda Richardson was sadly underused but her performance was good.  The climax of this film is another area that it excels.  It is a strong climax where Ralph Fiennes really shines as a manic Voldemort that has Harry trapped in a net wanting to do so much and yet not wanting to waste the opportunity.  The overall weakness is the amount of things that were changed or left out from the book.  Anyway, this film is weak, but you can't really skip it.  It isn't worth skipping either.  There are some genuinely good parts of the movie, but the casual viewer might find the film frantic upon a first viewing and somewhat annoying on the subsequent ones.  Also, the bad level here is the highest the series has to offer with not even some good performances to catch the viewers eye and make them pay attention to anything other than the scene that starts moments later.",

            "content": "I wasn't really excited at all going into Harry Potter & the Goblet Of Fire.  I had already watched 3 films, none of which really impressed me or kept me wanting more, but for some reason I soldiered on, maybe just out of sheer curiosity ot maybe just because I felt like I'd gotten far enough that I had to go all the way.  Well I'm definitely glad I did because Harry Potter & The Goblet Of Fire is a great movie.  Not only does it have all the technical wizardry of the first films that imrpessed me so much, but for once I was actually genuinely entertained by the story and actually enjoyed myself.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth year of Harry's time at the Hogworts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry, and the film appropriately works with the fact that he's growing up.  This film in particular concerns itself with the Tri-Wizard cup, an international wizardry tournament being held at Hogworts this year to determine the worlds best student wizard, and which of course Harry enters, not by his own will though.  Right off the bat the thing that impressed me was just how entertaining it was on its own.  For once the movie didn't just feel like it was pointlessly adding stuff in just to make it seem like a chapter of a larger story, it actually works as a film by itself.  This makes it work better as a film altogether, and makes for a much more entertaining plot.  What's great though is that it somehow does still contribute to the overall story.  It finally brings us Voldemort, the real Voldemort finally, and introduced many of the demons Harry will have to face later on.  It's sort of odd how the only way I can describe the movie contradicts itself, but it just kind of does, but somehow it works more successfully than any of the previous films.\r\n\r\nAnother real strength The Goblet Of Fire has is how it treats its characters, now aging and likewise maturing.  The film deals with many of the problems teenagers face in reality, such as love, betrayal, and the importance of friendship that ultimately ends up making it more deep, more comples, but most importantly highly relateable.  From this relateability it actually makes the characters seem more real and it actually gives you a better appreciation for them, as well as a better understanding.\r\n\r\nThis really helps make Harry Potter a more serious film, something I thought the others had a big problem with, they were just sort of silly little kid movies, and the big problem with the third film was that it was a little too serious, it was downright dark and at times a little depressing.  This one really hits the perfect note though, it keeps the characters serious, but keeps the story fun and entertaining, like this type of fantasy adventure should be.\r\n\r\nOne thing I still praise the living hell out of this series is that it always has the exact same people.  Not only does it make it easier for the viewer to keep track of who's who, but it really gives the actors time to grow into their roles and really perfect them, and in my opinion this is where the young actors truly did that.  Daniel Radcliffe is perfect as the always troubled Harry, bringing new emotion to a character that previously lacked a lot of it, again thanks to the improved character.  Rupert Grint is great as Ron, and seeing him grow has been fairly interesting, especially his changing relationship with Hermoine, played perfectly by Emma Watson who also gets a chance to shine with the films big love story.  For the first time wel also see the real Voldemort, now played by Ralph Fiennes.  He's a talented actor and looks prett badass as the character (although the fact that he doesn't have a nose is kind of off), but he isn't really in it enough to show us his stuff, that will have to wait.  Also appearing is Robert Pattinson of Twilight fame as one of Harry's tri-wizard cup opponents (I wonder how Stephen King feels about that knowing his love for Potter and hatred of Twilight).  He actually does a decent job, I was surprised.  I've never seen Twilight but from what I understand there is nothing good to say about it!\r\n\r\nAs with any long running series, the effects and technology will obviously improve as time goes on and The Goblet Of Fire is no excepetion.  It's by far the best looking Harry Potter yet in terms of its effects, but also uses them to better advantage.  Many of the scenes involving the competition for the Tri-wizard cup show off the effects perfectly, but the scene that stole the show for me was Harry's flying duel with the dragon which looked terrific and miles better than the flying sequences of the previous films.  The final battle with Voldemort also looks fantastic and has a certain eerieness to it that I like, finally a fitting appearence for the villain we've been hearing so much about.\r\n\r\nThe Goblet Of Fire featured yet again another director for the franchise, this time by the name of Mike Newell.  Not only does he capture all of the action in drama in a way that is both fun and suitably magical, but he also just nails the vibe of the whole movie, and makes it feel the way it should be.  The best thing I think he really did for the series was help transition it from the child-oriented adventures of the early films to the dark, serious epics of the later films, doing it seemlessly and making it feel appropriate that with Voldemort now here, everything has changed.\r\n\r\nThe Goblet Of Fire really is the turning point of the series.  It's when just about everything improved, from the obvious things like effects and sets, to the character's emotions, ths story, and the overall tone.  It's the finest and deepest film of the series yet, and in my opinion by far the best so far.  It really changed my mind about what the series could do, and I look forward to later installments because of it.",

Instead, we get director Mike Newell, who really hasn't done many films of consequence, not until this one at least. What impressed me the most was how Newell preserved the dark tone set by Alfonso Cuaron in the previous film. It's just as dark as before, and we even get to see an on-screen death, which may seem shocking to those who enjoyed Chris Columbus' childish Potter films, which were quite tame and dull. The story is just as mature as the previous, with enough hilarious and emotionally deep moments to carry the audience through the film. The acting is just as good as it was before, and the cinematography is good, but not as great as in the previous installment. It may not rank as high as Prisoner of Azkaban, but it's still a great addition to the series.",

For one, Voldemort is growing more scarier and scarier by the film, as the movies get more mature. For two, it has a tons of action. For three, Hermoine's sympathy for mistreated house elves.

Mike Newell's take on Rowling's mammoth novel is darker and more action packed than its predecessors, but ultimately too episodic and lacking in heart. If there was an entry in the series that really warranted being split into two films it was this one; the executive decision to cut not only every subplot in the book, but also some of its most memorable events (the Quidditch World Cup) is almost disasterous. The film is essentially one action set piece after another, leaving little room for the artistic flair shown in Cuaron's Azkaban, or the more whimsical moments between the lead trio we've grown accustomed to. In the film's defense there are some brilliant moments; the battle with the dragon, the Yule Ball, and of course the rebirth of Voldemort remains the scariest moment in the entire series. Ralph Fiennes is an inspired casting choice for the Dark Lord, while Brendan Gleeson is also a great addition as Mad Eye Moody. Overall a solid flick in terms of action and spectacle, but if I could ask for a do-over of any of the movies, it would have to be this one.",

But the only thing is that you have to be a certain age to be able to put your name in the cup, which is i think 18. & somehow Harry's name gets put in the cup. & everyone in his year get kind of mad because he would get to & they wouldn't. So mad that even his BFF, Ron goes against him for a bit. Anyways so he has to do the tournament with 3 other people. Cedric Diggory (a new Robert Pattinson), Viktor Krum, & Fleur Detor. The first thing you have to do is pick a dragon out of a bag & which ever dragon you pick you go against the bigger version. & you have to get an egg from underneath the dragon, that's why you get a broom. Once you get the egg it reveals a secret to your next match. Which is you have to go down into the Black Lake, which has evil mermaids with sharp triton things. The thing is you have to save one person, but Harry sees 2 people that he wants to save, actually that he has to save because Fleur got unlucky & was taken away by the mermaids, poor Fleur. & when they're done with that the next match is a maze. A maze that moves every few seconds. But what you have to do is find a cup. & what happens is that Cedric & Harry both end up finding the cup, which ends up being a portal to another area. So they both grab the cup at the same time. & unfortunately it leads to a graveyard where The Dark Lord \"Voldemort\" is being reborn. Bad idea Harry. Goblet is probably the darkest of all, & introduces even more creatures & new characters. Goblet is another well done Potter film.",

            "content": "I have to be honest; this is the first review I have written where I wonder if I can be truly unbiased when evaluating its merit. There are two problems with me reviewing this movie. One is that I am so close to the source material, this book in particular, in my head it's hard to separate one from the other and it's difficult not to compare the two. Another problem is that I've seen this movie so many times over the years that honestly it's less a movie and more a part of my life and who I am. Now that I have that out of the way I will try and be objective in my evaluation of this movie as a film, not as a part of my childhood. This movie is probably my second favorite of the entire series, trumped only by the final eighth film. I love the story of the Tri-Wizard Tournament and though some of the intricacies are lost in the film it's a real turning point for the series. Since this is my first Harry Potter review I'll touch on the acting. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are all absolutely perfect in their respective roles. These three young actors are a once in a lifetime find. They fit their roles perfectly and have grown from cute kids to excellent young adult actors. If a remake was ever made of this franchise the director would likely not be able to strike gold again. Now that I've touched on the main characters I'll move on to the supporting cast. First of all let me just list them: Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Brendan Gleeson, Ralph Finnes, Robbie Coltrane, David Tennant, Gary Oldman, Timothy Spall, and Warwick Davis. These are some of the greatest English actors around right now, and they are all here in top form. This supporting cast really speaks to how truly magical this series is. All of these top English thespians gladly giving their talents really shows how great of a world J.K. Rowling has created. I can gush about this movie and series all day long, but I really don't know how to convey why it's special unless you just know. I haven't touched on the writing or directing because honestly I don't really notice it at this point, neither is distracting so I guess there's that. The visual effects for this movie are pretty damn impressive especially considering it came out almost ten years ago. The dragons, mermaids, ghosts, flying horses, and most impressively the makeup done on human-esque creatures like Voldemort, or goblins all look great. Obviously I'm a Potterhead, and a proud one too so these films are very special to me and despite their flaws, I will never not love them.",

Also Goblet of Fire is where we get to see an embodied Voldermort, tri-wizard tournment, and the death of likeable a character (a trend Rowling will continue in upcoming books).

Before he can think too much about it, however, Harry boards the train to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he will attend his fourth year of magical education. Shortly after his reunion with his best friends, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), Harry is introduced to yet another Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher: the grizzled Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), a former dark wizard catcher who agreed to take on the infamous \"DADA\" professorship as a personal favor to Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). Of course, Harry's wishes for an uneventful school year are almost immediately shattered when he is unexpectedly chosen, along with fellow student Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson), as Hogwarts' representative in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, which awards whoever completes three magical tasks the most skillfully with a thousand-galleon purse and the admiration of the international wizard community. As difficult as it is to deal with his schoolwork, friendships, and the tournament at the same time (not to mention his feelings toward the ever unfathomable Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), Harry doesn't realize that the most feared wizard in the world, Lord Voldemort, is anticipating the tournament, as well.\r\n\r\ni am a great fan of Harry Potter series, been re-reviewing all of the movies in the reverse order. this is one of my most favorite and one of the most eye candy and adventurous/thrilling movie of the franchise. loved the whole experience. after Order Of Phoenix , this is the movie i have seen alot times on DVD and on TV.\r\n\r\nDirected by Mike Newell, who previously directed some big movies like Four Weddings and a Funeral, Donnie Brasco, Mona Lisa Smile and after this movie Love in the Time of Cholera and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time . pretty well known movies. he directed just this entry of the franchise.\r\n\r\nthis movie is dark too but in a different way, also this movie marks the first time human appearance of Lord Voldemort played so well by Ralph Fiennes. this movie has so much going on and it is fast paced, again i can't comment about how well it was adapted since i haven't read the books. direction was really good, well done. Screenplay was pitch perfect this movie is nearly flawless. good art direction for which it was nominated for Oscar, the only one. good cinematography and other technical stuff. story plot and written work was fabulous. Special effects were very good, pretty attractive and just so good.\r\n\r\nthis movie stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Robbie Coltrane, Ralph Fiennes , Michael Gambon , Brendan Gleeson , Jason Isaacs , Gary Oldman , Alan Rickman , Robert Pattinson , Maggie Smith , Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy , Frances De La Tour , Timothy Spall , Miranda Richardson , Stanislav Ianevski , Sheila Allen , Warwick Davis , Robert Hardy , Matthew Lewis , Margery Mason , Adrian Rawlins , Geraldine Somerville , David Sterne , Eric Sykes , Alan Watts , Christopher Whittingham , Jeff Rawle , Shirley Henderson , Roger Lloyd Pack , Tom Felton , David Bradley , Mark Williams , David Tennant and others. good job by everyone.\r\n\r\nthis movie has Harry to deal with his Scar problems and the hallucinations. the other big problem is he accidentally gets chosen for the Tri-Wizard tournament that is for grown up wizards being organized this time in Hogwarts. he has to do 3 tasks which are very dangerous and that is where all the fun is. the most enjoyable adventurous sun movie of them all. superb. loved it.",

            "content": "I used to hate Goblet of Fire for its absolute butchering of the uniquely crafted fourth book, which is Rowling's crucial bridge between the rich, layered world of Harry's adventure days and the dark atmosphere of impending doom that dominates the remainder of the books. The angst is the most painful here, and the entire chunk between the first and second trials  - namely the leadup and the Yule Ball itself - are awkward, painful and underwhelming - this may accurately portray the awkwardness of puberty but such things are better relegated to subtle sequences and indicators spread throughout a work rather than a half hour or more rest stop for budding romance and dance drama. Hundreds of pages are dispensed with in the first fifteen minutes and this makes it all the more painful that so much of the melodrama is retained. The Flesh, Blood and Bone ceremony is well done but the obligatory meeting with Dumbledore is too much neglected. However, the film does treat the character of Amos better, giving him some real emotional punch when Cedric's body is returned. Book >>>>> Movie",
