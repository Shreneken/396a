The acting is great, the story flows perfectly. And in some ways, you can say that the movie is better than the book. For example, why is a quarter of a 445 paged book not on the island? And why does it not get to some action until about page 200? But the book is still a masterpiece, when you put them back to back, the book is an obvious win, destroying the movie. But that is besides the point. Jurassic Park is amazing, well done, incredible performances done by Richard Attenborough, Sam Niell, Jeff Goldblum, and pretty much everybody else in this film. (Except for Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello, but, hey, they were just kids.)",

The cinematography is phenomenal with memorable and creative sets, dinosaur designs and special effects that are still some of the best ever put to screen. The CGI & Animatronic/Practical Effects weave seamlessly to the point a lot of times you can't even tell which is which. The music is incredible with an all time classic theme song and fitting numbers to go along with this amazing adventure. This is a perfectly paced film also that builds tension perfectly. The only slight weakness is the editing is solid but not up to par with the other elements. Sometimes it jumps around a bit and relies on lots of coincidences rather than a natural flow of things. Also the villain isn't that good to boot. But everything else is just so well done and so creative that it's not a problem to suspend some disbelief with this story and logic. Great underlying message about Life and Evolution as well. Everyone should give this a watch. It's just as good as it was when it came out.",

            "content": "Jurassic Park \u2013 Uma Joia que n\u00e3o Envelhece\nJurassic Park \u00e9 um filme de fic\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica e a\u00e7\u00e3o de 1993, dirigido por Steven Spielberg e estrelado por Laura Dern, Sam Neil, Jeff Goldblum e Richard Attenborough, entre outros, com roteiro de Michael Crichton e David Koepp. Em resumo, o filme trata sobre a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de um parque tem\u00e1tico onde dinossauros ressuscitados por meio de clonagem s\u00e3o a atra\u00e7\u00e3o principal. O dono, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), ao sofrer problemas com os investidores e pressionado pelo advogado Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), chama para a ilha onde foi constru\u00edda a atra\u00e7\u00e3o, tr\u00eas cientistas com a fun\u00e7\u00e3o de verificar a seguran\u00e7a, e aproveita para levar seus netos juntos no passeio inaugural. Tudo cai por terra quando o funcion\u00e1rio Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) trai seu chefe, roubando alguns embri\u00f5es e desligando a seguran\u00e7a do parque, deixando os dinossauros \u00e0 solta.\nO filme \u00e9 baseado em um livro hom\u00f4nimo, escrito por Michael Crichton, do qual eu n\u00e3o li e, portanto, n\u00e3o poderei discutir sob o ponto de vista de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o, o que planejo corrigir futuramente. Mas, como obra isolada, Jurassic Park \u00e9 praticamente uma obra prima, tanto do ponto de vista t\u00e9cnico como de roteiro. \nSobre a hist\u00f3ria, ela \u00e9 bem estruturada, com nenhum grande furo que eu pudesse identificar, e di\u00e1logos naturais e bem escritos em sua maioria, com algumas exce\u00e7\u00f5es, em especial se tratando das crian\u00e7as. A atua\u00e7\u00e3o, infelizmente, deixa \u00e0 desejar. Apesar de n\u00e3o ser ruim, a qualidade dos di\u00e1logos n\u00e3o reflete na express\u00e3o dos personagens, que por vezes parecem ser um tanto quanto robotizados e met\u00f3dicos ao extremo, com exce\u00e7\u00e3o de Jeff Goldblum, que interpreta o personagem Ian Malcom, um matem\u00e1tico que visita a ilha como representante do advogado, e atua magistralmente como tal.\nOs momentos de tens\u00e3o e a\u00e7\u00e3o, que s\u00e3o muitos depois que come\u00e7am, s\u00e3o todos fenomenais e conseguem prender a aten\u00e7\u00e3o do espectador, al\u00e9m de o manter tenso a todos os momentos. Apesar de ser, de fato, um filme repleto de cenas e momentos de a\u00e7\u00e3o, o ritmo da obra \u00e9 agrad\u00e1vel desde o in\u00edcio, mais parado, mas n\u00e3o por isso lento. Voc\u00ea fica engajado na hist\u00f3ria e quer continuar assistindo para descobrir o que acontecer\u00e1 nos pr\u00f3ximos minutos.\nA parte t\u00e9cnica do filme consegue ser melhor ainda, entregando exatamente o que promete, com efeitos extremamente modernos para o in\u00edcio da d\u00e9cada de 90 e ao que ao mesmo tempo n\u00e3o ficaram datados. A mistura de efeitos pr\u00e1ticos e digitais os tornam ainda recentes nos dias de hoje, e mesmo com a diferen\u00e7a dos animatr\u00f4nicos para os dinossauros gerados digitalmente, n\u00e3o causa estranhesa enquanto voc\u00ea assiste, com transi\u00e7\u00f5es quase impercept\u00edveis entre os dois m\u00e9todos. O \u00e1udio em um geral tamb\u00e9m est\u00e1 impec\u00e1vel, tanto nos sons emitidos pelos dinos quanto na m\u00fasica, uma composi\u00e7\u00e3o perfeita pelo maestro John Williams. N\u00e3o poderia se dizer que o filme seria o mesmo sem a trilha sonora cuidadosamente selecionada para os momentos certos, e que ainda continua sendo linda de se ouvir fora dele.\nE antes de terminar, gostaria de elogiar a parte cient\u00edfica do filme. Apesar de n\u00e3o ser totalmente precisa, ainda assim \u00e9 uma obra que tenta cuidar para ser o mais veross\u00edmil poss\u00edvel e passar a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de que aquilo pode muito bem ter acontecido no nosso mundo. As conversas do Doutor Grant (Sam Neil) tentam sempre passar um teor cient\u00edfico, com informa\u00e7\u00f5es que na \u00e9poca eram sim verdadeiras, apesar de j\u00e1 terem sido desclassificadas h\u00e1 muito. Por\u00e9m, um dos erros que mais me incomoda e foi deixado por causa do livro, que tamb\u00e9m continha esse erro, \u00e9 o dos velociraptores, que na verdade seriam, pela apar\u00eancia e descri\u00e7\u00e3o de h\u00e1bitos, Utahraptors. Al\u00e9m disso, a falta de penas em algumas esp\u00e9cies \u00e9 triste, por\u00e9m compreens\u00edvel do ponto de vista cinematogr\u00e1fico.\nConcluindo, Jurassic Park \u00e9 um filme incr\u00edvel, com alguns defeitos, mas que s\u00e3o esquec\u00edveis perto de suas qualidades, uma joia que estava \u00e0 frente do seu tempo e continua sendo fruto de estudo para os atuais nomes do cinema",

The acting of everyone is top notch, i honestly dont have a favorite character, they are all so well designed. This movie really hits those horror vibes, but at the other side those family movie vibes and its just really well combined. I can appriciate the new Jurassic World movies for it's top notch VFX, but i can see why people have so much nostalgia for these old practical effects.

I have always wanted a classic Jurassic park shirt, I have never gotten one. What makes\u00a0the visuals\u00a0so great is that at the time this movie came out, it was\u00a0practical effects vs special effects, animatronics vs CGI, that's why they did their best to show how good each one is. Some scenes that I thought was an animatronic was actually special effects.\u00a0There is so many scene that is jaw dropping\u00a0amazing like the sick Triceratops, the T-Rex escaping and even the venomous Dilophosaurus, even everything else like the cars, the park itself and even the atmosphere itself like the forests and the storms.\u00a0Everything is done to perfection. The\u00a0sound is one of the best ever, it's extremely loud and the bass is very heavy feeling like you at the theatre, especially with that T-Rex roar.

Crichton also wrote Westworld and they are in some ways almost the same story, about a theme park's characters gone awry. Probably one of the more amazing things about Jurassic Park was the state of the script almost up to the point where they started filming. The script was drastically different and underwent some incredible late revisions... to understand how different this movie could have been, the very first script draft included things like Alan Grant leaning down and licking the dinosaur bone he was excavating.... scenes that were thankfully removed.  This movie version took the best parts of the book without dumbing it down.  Really sold the idea, turning a wonderful novel into a great family movie with provocative, intelligent themes.",

While a tad too long and has one or two loose ends in the plot, Jurassic Park nevertheless has thrilling action and has sheer evidence of the director's vision and effortless verve at work. John Williams's score is absolutely terrific, definitely one of the more memorable scores in a Steven Spielberg movie, the score for Jaws like Psycho is one of the main reason why I am so scared to go into the sea now. The acting is really not bad at all, Sam Neill and Laura Dern have given better performances but they were good. Jeff Goldblum is terrific, and as Dennis Nedry Wayne Knight is suitably more subdued. Richard Attenborough, a talented actor and a even more talented director also is good as John Hammond, while child star Joseph Mazello, who surprised me in Shadowlands is appealing as Tim. However, the real stars are the dinosaurs, especially the T-Rex, the mix of computer animation and models is inspiring. The cinematography is astounding, the script is good and the direction is lively. I haven't read Michael Crichton's book, but regardless this is a hugely enjoyable film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Through Dino-soaring cinematography, Spielberg draws viewers into scientists' journey investigate Jurassic-Park sites without dinosaurs bites.

Spielberg showcases extraordinary control over production-design, editing and music, create dino-soaring cinematic achievement. One appreciates astonishing cast performances. Laura Dern delivers one of the best performance of her career as Dr. Ellie Sattler. With mesmerizing expressions, she conveys angst, determination and feminist spirit of female scientist refusing let ears become sore listening dinosaurs roar. Jeff Goldblum is magnificent as a mischievous mathematician searching for human interaction over dinosaur action. Goldblum brings funny comical relief to movie in one of greatest roles. Concluding standout's Richard Attenborough. As scientist hell-bent to achieving world-domination, he brings palpable menace to the movie.

If female scientist whose ears become sore listening dinosaurs with special abilities roars requested assessing Steven Spielberg's downwards careers trajectories, they would recommend filmmaker whose life's seldom been walk in Jurassic-Park allow women 'inherit-the-Earth' of archeological sites despite Indiana Jones archaeologists arguing women screaming at \"Snakes-why'd-it-have-to-be-Snakes\" sightings don't deserve embarking upon Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark journeys across Skull islands dominated by King-Kong apes whose Jaws leave humans as afraid of stepping into waters as sharks originating Close-Encounters-of-the-Third-King galaxies house E.T. alien creatures unable bid goodbyes to children taught history always doomed to repeat itself that those who do not learn from Schindler-List mass genocide tragedies are doomed victimizing black women wearing The-Color-Purple attires on slavery plantations against wishes of famed Lincoln presidents' policies forewarning War-of-the-Worlds catastrophes scarcely prevented foreseen by Minority-Report police authorities.",

It is the first film in which dinosaurs actually looked real, and the T. rex remains the best depiction of this creature ever to appear on film. The raptors (stated to be Velociraptor, but actually based on the larger Deinonychus) lack feathers and are overly intelligent, but this does at least follow the book it was based on. A great action flick for anyone who likes dinosaurs, full of memorable scenes and quotable lines. \"Life \u2026 uh \u2026 finds a way.\"",

It is the dawning of believable CG effects in major motion pictures, illustrating what can be done with the burgeoning technology. It is also largely responsible for the death of animatronics. A considerably more time consuming and expensive way at special effects and far more constricting at what can be done. It is arguable that this shift was inevitable but Jurassic Park was objectively a catalyst in this transition. Fortunately for us all this catalyst is also a defining triumph in Speilbergs career. As smart as it is technically inventive and as harrowing as it is emotionally resonate. Jurassic Park is Speilbergs at the top of his game.

Based on the iconic book by Michael Crichton it tells the story of how a powerful rich man John Hammond played by the great late Richard Attenborough resurrects dinosaurs with genetic engineering and creating a theme park on a remote island featuring these dinosaurs.  Of course something goes wrong and the dinosaurs escape wreaking havoc and terrifying the human characters. This movie is now a classic and it has aged very well since 1993. There are many things that work here to perfection. A script that is able to create suspense as well as  a strong sense of adventure. The characters are some of the best written characters in cinematic history dominiated by the trio of Sam Neill as paleontogist Alan Grant, Laura Dern as Ellie Satler a paleobotanist and the exquisite and charismatic Jeff Goldblum as chaos theorist Ian Malcom. These actors do an incredible job of playing characters we grow to care about and we see them being transformed and evolving as the movie progresses with one of the highlights being Ian Malcoms Jeff Goldblum with his punchlines and smartly scientific delivery. However the stars are the dinosaurs who are a combination of CGI and animatronics. This movie revolutionized Hollywood since it was the first time such lifelike creatures had been brought to the screen with this kind of technology and the world has never been the same. The dinosaurs are realistic, lifelike, beautiful and completely terryfing with the highlights being the raptors and the T Rex. The incredible music of John Williams is now iconic and is recognized all over the world and Spilerbergs direction makes this a very fun movie that knows how to keep the audience in suspense. Its filled with science, moments of sheer terror, adventure, and a sense of childhlike wonder that makes this movie  a delight and the one started a new era of dinosaur movies.",

While a tad too long and has one or two loose ends in the plot, Jurassic Park nevertheless has thrilling action and has sheer evidence of the director's vision and effortless verve at work. John Williams's score is absolutely terrific, definitely one of the more memorable scores in a Steven Spielberg movie, the score for Jaws like Psycho is one of the main reason why I am so scared to go into the sea now. The acting is really not bad at all, Sam Neill and Laura Dern have given better performances but they were good. Jeff Goldblum is terrific, and as Dennis Nedry Wayne Knight is suitably more subdued. Richard Attenborough, a talented actor and a even more talented director also is good as John Hammond, while child star Joseph Mazello, who surprised me in Shadowlands is appealing as Tim. However, the real stars are the dinosaurs, especially the T-Rex, the mix of computer animation and models is inspiring. The cinematography is astounding, the script is good and the direction is lively. I haven't read Michael Crichton's book, but regardless this is a hugely enjoyable film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

It was only after I gained interest in watching movies did I decide to give this a look. I just got my Prime subscription and had seen everything, so I decided to give this a try. And boy was I surprised! I didn't even know what I was going to expect and being a huge sucker for wildlife and natural environment, this movie made me delve into a fantasy world. Undoubtedly this is an iconic movie right off the bat.\nJurassic Park has some of the most iconic characters from the 90s science fiction. The reason being that in spite of being a movie about dinosaurs, it was able to put the human characters inside with such effortlessness. I really liked John Hammond. What he did in the movie is something I'd really want to see happen in real life. Ian Malcolm also made the side characters look very interesting, as though he alone carried the burden of the comic relief scenes. And when it comes to the CGI, I don't think we even need enough words. This was fire right from the start. Seeing dinosaurs just do something on the screen and behave like actual wild animals was so awesome.\nThe story was also pretty good. The idea that a scientist has created a wildlife sanctuary for dinosaurs where we travel using an self driven car is a fantasy for many Millennials and Gen-Z alike. If something like that happens in real life we will definitely want to give it a look. And seeing what all misadventures they had to go through, we have the uneasy feeling watching it. The T-Rex scenes still hold very well, especially the iconic part where the children are being driven away in the car.\nI really wanted Jurassic Park to be a standalone movie, which could be remastered into 4K as time and technology gets better. Even today it doesn't look outdated, other than the fact that some dinosaurs have been discovered to look different like the velociraptor, and the camera quality is very 90s-ish. But watching it on a big TV really gives the feel of seeing it in a theatre due to the old resolution. A definite recommendation from me.",

For any director that needs inspiration on creating a great big budget film, look no further than JP. Of course at first glance people will rave about the cutting edge technology used to bring the CGI to life (to this day some scenes still hold up like they were made in present day). But more or less the movie's real core and brilliance comes from its moral compass and what it tries to talk about. Michael Crichton and David Koepp expertly talk about the ethical ramifications of bringing to life dinosaurs and the idea of just using them as show pieces. Outside of the terrifying and amazing action set pieces, that lunch table scene where the conversation touches upon playing god is by far one of the best written scenes in a blockbuster film. You got fantastic performances from Sam Neil, Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern, Samuel L. Jackson, Richard Attenborough, and Wayne Knight. You have legendary music from John Williams. You got the picturesque views of Hawaii filling in for Costa Rica. And you have dinosaurs ruling the earth again! What else do you need!?",

Here they discover the island is full of living dinosaurs, brought to life by genetic scientists. Where Jurassic Park sets a whole new standard is the pioneering of visual and sound effects. The dinosaurs onscreen look insanely real, both CGI and animatronic. I recall being absolutely terrified as a child at the enormous roar of the T-Rex. Upon re-release in 2013, the movie looked just as breathtaking as it did 20 years ago on the big screen.

A cautionary tale of what can go wrong by skipping background checks on your employees or ignoring local weather forecasts, Jurassic Park is as much a delight as it is horrifying. Hollywood's finest magic is on display as a mix of practical effects and computer animation brings to life Universal Studios' bravest moment yet; showing a Tyrannosaurus Rex eat a lawyer off of a toilet. Steven Spielberg does Michael Crichton's novel more than justice, but he misses out on a full star here for not having the balls to kill a kid.",

I remember that it was the first pg-13 movie I was allowed to watch, and what a way to start my grown up movie experience!!! Everything in this movie screams adventure, from the opening scene where the jungle leaves rustle, the shot of mysterious sparkling amber, to the landing of the helicopter on a remote rainforest island, the movie sets the tone for the greatest adventure movie ever made. As you hear John Williams glorious theme start to swell, and you see Alan remove his glasses and start to tremble, you know you're about to witness one of the most magical moments ever put on cinema. I can't go into detail on all the incredible scenes, from the T-Rex reveal, to the kitchen scene, but each one of them revolutionized what we thought movie magic could take us. Thank you Spielberg for making this enchanting piece of art for us, an entire generation is indebted to you.",

            "content": "\"Jurrassic Park\" de 1993 es una pel\u00edcula de la cual me sorprender\u00eda que alguien, amante del cine o no, nunca haya escuchado hablar de ella. Ya que es una cinta que marc\u00f3 un hito en la historia f\u00edlmica por sus efectos especiales y que ha constituido una cultura popular alrededor de ella, siendo ampliamente recordada hasta estos d\u00edas.\nUna cinta que viene de la mano del director Steven Spielberg quien, hasta ese momento, hab\u00eda dirigido pel\u00edculas como: E.T. El Extraterrestre (1982), Tibur\u00f3n (1975), la saga de Indiana Jones (1981), entre otros \u00e9xitos en taquilla. Un cineasta que tiene una forma de narrar y contar historias \u00fanicas, m\u00e1gicas y capaces de meterte en la pel\u00edcula tal como lo hace en esta historia a partir de la idea de la novela escrita por Michael Crichton.\nParque Jur\u00e1sico en espa\u00f1ol es una cinta de ciencia ficci\u00f3n y aventuras que nos cuenta la historia de c\u00f3mo el millonario, John Hammon (Richard Attenborough), ha construido un parque repleto de dinosaurios reales en una isla cerca de Costa Rica. Aunque, debido a la presi\u00f3n de los inversores del proyecto, Hammon tiene que buscar a un grupo de expertos para que dictaminen si el lugar es seguro o no, antes de su apertura al p\u00fablico.\n Por lo que el paleont\u00f3logo Alan Grant (Sam Neill), la paleobot\u00e1nica Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), el matem\u00e1tico Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) y un representante de los inversores, Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), tendr\u00e1n que aventurarse en este fant\u00e1stico lugar. Sin embargo, las medidas de seguridad del parque no prev\u00e9n el instinto de supervivencia de la naturaleza ni la codicia del ser humano, lo cual provocara una crisis inevitable.\nEn lo particular, Jurassic Park es una pel\u00edcula que recuerdo con bastante cari\u00f1o, ya que en m\u00e1s de alguna ocasi\u00f3n la vi junto a mis padres por la televisi\u00f3n cuando era ni\u00f1o. Simplemente me fascinaba ver a los protagonistas interactuando con los temibles dinosaurios junto a sus sorprendentes rugidos cuando persegu\u00edan a alguna persona, \u00a1era incre\u00edble!\nSin embargo, recientemente que he vuelto a ver la pel\u00edcula, puedo mencionar que mi yo de peque\u00f1o se emocionaba justamente. Esto, ya que los efectos especiales y visuales de la cinta, junto a la banda sonora de John Williams, constituyen uno de los puntos m\u00e1s destacables.\n Un filme que parece no haber envejecido con los a\u00f1os, ya que, incluso en una \u00e9poca en la que el CGI est\u00e1 a la orden del d\u00eda, sigue siendo disfrutable y bastante admirable el trabajo realizado, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de una trama bastante floja.\nYa que, si bien gracias a la direcci\u00f3n y toque de Spielberg el espectador se sumerge en la cinta, no es gracias al desarrollo de la misma, sino a causa de la acci\u00f3n y suspenso en la que se ven envueltos los protagonistas. Una pel\u00edcula que no se sostendr\u00eda sin el espectacular Tyrannosaurus Rex quien es el que le da sentido a los hechos que suceden. Y que incluso provoca que la cinta tenga un conflicto m\u00e1s o menos desarrollado.\nEsto en vista que los principales protagonistas solamente est\u00e1n a merced de los hechos y no hay espacio para desarrollar o conocer sus verdaderos conflictos personales. Por lo que algunos personajes se sienten forzados en sus acciones y en las relaciones que estos tienen entre s\u00ed.\nAunque solamente destacar aquello que tiene como protagonista a los dinosaurios ser\u00eda desmerecer secuencias magnificas en las que el director muestra un tipo de terror similar al de sus primeras cintas como la de Tibur\u00f3n en la que el suspenso y terror est\u00e1 muy bien utilizado.\nUna pel\u00edcula que es contada de forma lineal con un final abierto que dej\u00f3 espacio para secuelas que se realizaci\u00f3n a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s y que incluso han logrado extenderse hasta la fecha con cintas como Jurassic World. \nEn todo caso este filme busca retratar la descarada ambici\u00f3n humana por el dinero y el control sobre la naturaleza. As\u00ed lo hace ver, a manera de met\u00e1fora, el personaje del Dr. Ian Malcolm cuando dice \"Ustedes utilizan sus conocimientos como el ni\u00f1o que ha encontrado el rev\u00f3lver de su padre\".\nEn definitiva, Jurassic Park es una pel\u00edcula que todo amante del cine o cualquier otra persona deber\u00eda de ver ya que refleja completamente el trabajo minucioso en la creaci\u00f3n de una cinta diferente de ciencia ficci\u00f3n con los recursos de la \u00e9poca. Pero m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de eso es una historia para disfrutar e imaginar que ser\u00eda s\u00ed esta isla en verdad existiera.",

            "content": "The star of Jurassic Park was not the dinosaurs so much as it was that \"Life will find a way\".  In that sense the terror of the dinosaurs, and the awe, is a stand-in for the sheer power of life itself to find a way to survive and thrive under difficult situations.  A monster movie works best when the monsters, in this case humanities re-invented dinosaurs, represent something more powerful than that which we can control.  Often times it is the power of nature and/or humanities' efforts that create an unbalancing of nature that the monster represents.  The chaos mathematician, despite his eccentricity, is our best direct voice of wisdom and understanding of the real magic and his words point to the real star of this film.  Complex, adaptive systems is a real science that expands well-beyond the realm of chaos theory but can be seen to work in the same space.  Systems are orderly but also are stable in response to disturbance.  Life has developed over millions of years and has shown in ways deeper than we fully appreciate how as an intertwined set of complex, adaptive systems, it has survived and flourished in so many places and in spite of so many threats of mass extinction.    \n\nThe second and third film try out their own higher minded principles but these principles are merely derivative and not as well executed.  The next two sequels are held together only by their action sequences and the desire to try to escape immediate danger.  As such they are, at best, merely coda's to this first movie.  \n\nIt is the temptation to feel like one can be in control of these forces in some final way that is the crucial element, the villain so to speak, that puts the viewer into the fullest appreciation of the power that is life itself.  This element is present in the first movie , the second movie approaches it but not in any new way, and the last movie is even more derivative on that note.  In the first movie, each character's arc reflects on this theme of rational control vs creative freedom to escape control.",

I have watched this movie over and over a bunch of times. I highly recommend this movie because it takes you on a ride and opens up your imagination. Also keeps you on your toes and guessing if our technology will ever be that advanced. Sometimes I wish it would really happen but others I think its too dangerous that we shouldn't even try. In the end this movie is one of the best movies i have ever saw.",

After watching Jurassic Park, once again I am in awe of how well the effects still hold up. This movie doesn\u2019t feel dated at all, even 27 years later. The story of man creates monsters and monster turning on man is something that is done over and over, but Jurassic Park always holds the bar for the best that genre can offer.

However, the child acting is as always cringe worthy and sometimes they overact, but Spielberg does the best he can with giving these kids the direction they need. There is also a couple of weird moments in the film that didn't make sense to me.

I feel like this movie franchise has greatly affected what's true about dinosaurs. And even if there were to make a historically accurate Jurrasic park movie it definitely wouldn't be as popular since one of the main reasons people go to see these movies are too watch Giant, terrifying, scaley Trexs roar and rip people apart and a real T rex is not like that. But I definitely don't hate this movie! The animatronics used are incredible, The music always gives me chills and it has a great story!

I love the beginning of this movie it has a mysterious nature, of course, I and everyone else know that it was a dinosaur but it had to be a bit scary back then with all of the sound effects and the mysterious nature of the opening scene. This movie really has some truly amazing shots from the amazing insert shots to the grand scale shots they all look amazing. This movie really has some truly iconic scenes, lines, and characters, this whole movie is so iconic. This may be one of the best scores of all time and it may be my favorite rivaling interstellar and star wars and inception some truly amazing scores. My favorite part of this movie is Jeff Goldblum he is just so amazing and written perfectly. These grand scale shots mixed with the amazing score just make the scenes more astonishing. This movie really holds up with all of the movies now with all of the animatronics now and some of the CGI isn't the best but the quality of the movie really makes up for that. Steven Spielberg may have the most deceive resume from sci-fi to drama to musical. I forgot that Samuel L Jackson was in this, I swear he was in every movie in the '90s literally every movie. I love the whole story and the concept and if anyone else made this it would be very different and maybe even worse and I love the whole story and Spielberg kinda showed us a look into the future and this possibly could happen it wouldn't surprise me if it happened.\n\nThe cinematography is very good in this movie and the editing I love kinda showing the mystery in this movie. The acting is very solid all-around but the kids aren't the best but they are kids so they can improve with time. I think they wrote this perfectly and the character development I absolutely love they really develop each character and the character evolution for John I loved from good to good/bad I loved. The tension and suspense created I loved from the starting scene to the kitchen scene I loved and I really cared for all the characters. The sound design is amazing from the roars to the velociraptor screams is amazing and the taps they do all sound amazing. Overall I absolutely loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone.\n\ud83d\udcaf%",

I think the reason for the success of the film and its unforgettable feat were the great storyline which was partly written by the original novelist himself, great performances by the casts and great special effects, of course! Those dinosaurs that lived millions of years ago seems to be so alive and real! Another contribution to its success was the right balance of its themes of adventure, suspense, thriller, science fiction and drama. It even got a lesson to impart about containing life vs. scientific manipulation. I'm not surprised that it spawned 5 sequels over the years because of its success. And I won't be surprise if its popularity among us won't fade in time it is simply now a classic dinosaur movie.",

The plot is brilliant, the dialogue and characters are well written, and the acting is top notch. The visual effects were incredible for the time and the use of practical effects deserves high praise. The cinematography is pleasant, and the soundtrack is iconic. It contains some good humour, it has lots of thrilling action, and the film feels believable and real. This is practically a perfect film, and therefore a must watch classic.",

            "content": "Jurassic Park is an amazing movie and my personal favorite.  First off, the dinosaurs look awesome and feel real.  They each have unique behaviors and act as actual animals.  The reasoning to why they looked so real was because of the use of animatronics and practical effects.  CGI was used sparingly, and for the most part it still looked better than a lot of CGI today.  The second reason why Jurassic Park is such a good movie is because of the characters.  The characters and dialogue felt real.  Most, if not all of the characters are intriguing and lovable.  Hammond, played by Richard Attenborough, is sweet and full of excitement, which makes it easy to love him.  Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm is my favorite character in the movie.  His personality is very likable and unique.  He is very quirky and sometimes even cocky, and is also the main source of the little humor in the movie, but yet he is also the main voice of realism.  Also, almost everything he says is quotable.  I would love to describe the other characters, but I don't want to extend this review too long, and you can just watch the movie yourself.  Finally, the music in this movie is phenomenal.  John Williams really captures the magnificence and terror in his scores.  Sorry for the long review, but I wanted to express my main thoughts on why Jurassic Park is such an extraordinary film.",

Based on Michael Crichton\u00e2(TM)s novel the synopsis goes something like this- On a small island off the coast of Costa Rica exists a most unusual animal preserve by the name of Jurassic Park. Operated by dinosaur lover John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), Jurassic Park is the first of its kind. Its population of creatures includes brachiosaurs, dilophosaurs, tricerotops, velociraptors, and a Tyrannosaurus Rex, each of which has been cloned using the latest technology that takes DNA from dinosaur-biting prehistoric insects preserved in amber, and uses that DNA for the re-creation. When the consortium funding Jurassic Park become concerned that all is not as it should be, Hammond is forced to call in three experts: paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), his partner, paleo-botanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and the brilliant-but-cynical mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). When the trio arrives at Jurassic Park, they are astonished by what it represents. It doesn't take long, however, for astonishment to turn to horror. Great film by a great director.(Movie magic result in live breathing Dinosaurs).",

At a young age we were taught about these massive beasts roaming the earth, animals far beyond our greatest imaginations only to grow up and realize that these massive beasts were not to be seen again. Well Jurassic Park fulfilled those imaginations. When Steven Spielberg created this film, he opened our minds to ideas and scenarios beyond this world. He created difficult situations that were intense but weren't too intense for families and friends.\n  \tDuring the time action packed thriller movies never met in between. It was either too graphic or not graphic enough, but Spielberg found a way to change that. With C.G.I being a new form of technology the graphics on most films during that time were bland and somewhat unrealistic but in this film it was so detailed that it began to open people's minds on things that could be possible if they were to put their minds to it. At the same time this film showed a sense of humanity in a moment of terror. It reminded us that even in the darkest of times, humanism could be the deciding factor of life and death. Overall Steven Spielberg did an excellent job in sharing his imagination with the rest of the world, and by giving the rest of the world-especially children an imagination of their own. So much so that various movies have been made replicating this great movie.",

There's a reason why I make jokes at more modern movies' special effects saying \"X years after Jurassic Park\". This was 1993. And it made you believe in dinosaurs. I mean, they did exist, but whatever.\n\nIn regards to the orchestra that played, it does make one realise that goddamn, they play the main theme a lot. But it's another John Williams masterpiece, so it's fine. It captures everything good about this movie. The joy, the wonder, the adventure. \n\nThat's what every subsequent movie in the series lacks. That wonder. The miracle of dinosaurs. It's an amazing incredible thing. It's not meant to be a horror movie. Or a slasher. It just happens to turn out that way. But that's not the focus.\n\nIt's not about that. Jurassic Park is about a man who realises he's ready to start a family. That's the good shit.

            "content": "Without a doubt, Jurassic Park (1993) is one of the most iconic science fiction movies of all-time. In my opinion; regardless of genre, it is one of the greatest films ever. It certainly deserves its place as one of Director Steven Spielberg's best works in his long and prestigious career. The original film has a magic that none of its sequels have come close to replicating. Some reasons are derived from the fact that it is the first film in the franchise. Obviously, it has the novelty of showing the audience dinosaurs for the first time. Dinosaurs had been presented as monsters in films before Jurassic Park [e.g. King Kong fighting a Tyrannosaurus Rex in King Kong (1933)]. Nonetheless, Jurassic Park took great lengths to portray dinosaurs as realistic as possible based on the knowledge of its time. Accordingly, the movie is the first time that an authentic take on dinosaurs were presented on the big screen. Moreover, the film does well to capture the awe and amazement in the reactions of its characters when they initially come face to face with gigantic sauropods. Next, the discussions of the hypothetical science and the ethics behind wielding that power is fascinating, especially since the ethical debate regarding cloning was a significant topic back in the 1990s. No other film in the series provides nearly as interesting fruit for thought. Other reasons Jurassic Park is vastly superior to its sequels are not exclusive to it being the first in the series. For instance, it has a strong cast that portrays great characters. In addition, there is great chemistry among the cast and their characters. It is an amazing group that has not been replicated by the later films. Similarly, the sequels fall short in capturing the same level of terror that exudes through the screen once the safeguards of the park fall apart. I was in the second grade when my dad brought me to see Jurassic Park. I was fascinated by dinosaurs and super excited to watch a movie featuring them. I did not realize how petrified I would be by the legendary horror scenes featuring the Tyrannosaurus Rex and Velociraptors. I was so scared during the movie that I immediately got physically sick when I returned home. In the sequels, the carnivores have become carnival theme park monsters. They chase around the heroes but they never catch them. Moreover, the feeling of danger has been completely lost. Instead, they only feast on villains or secondary and tertiary supporting characters who the audience has little connection to in the films. Finally, the music from the movie is also epic. It is not surprising since legend John Williams scores the soundtrack. When you analyze the combination of all those factors, you understand why Jurassic Park is a truly special movie. Not surprisingly, the most memorable scenes and quotes in the franchise are in the first film. As John \"Ray\" Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson) would say it, \"Hold on to your butts.\"\n\nFor my full/ detailed review, please see:\nhttp://rookerville.com/2018/08/20/retrospective-review-jurassic-park/",

            "content": "And now we've come to the big one, Jurassic Park, the highest grossing film of all time. When people got to see this years back they are in awe just like me and they were on the edge of the seat when the thrill starts. Jurassic Park is a theme park of where dinosaurs is shown in the park of where dinosaurs lived a million years ago and to entertain people and kids with awe and they got rides in the park like most theme parks got. The film takes place at Isla Nublar. Three doctors, Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler and Ian Malcolm and others are with John Hammond travelling to a wildlife park called Jurassic Park where Hammond created cloned dinosaurs on Costa Rican island. While they arrive, they saw a brachiosaurus and Grant couldn't believe his eyes when Hammond said \"We have a T-Rex.\" The group watched a Saturday Morning Cartoon where DNA is telling you all about dinosaurs by extracting from mosquitoes. Sheesh! Looks like somebody been watching too many Looney Tunes! They went into the tour vehicles along with Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim and then comes across a sick triceratops. And then the power goes off so is the tour vehicles and a nerdy lazy computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, has been bribed by Dodgson, is stealing dino DNA and the Tyrannosaurus rex appears by breaking through the electric fences. Now let me get to something which REALLY mine and everybody's minds. First I'll start off by saying that I f**king love the special effects. The special effects are the highlight of the film and it mixes a lot of it with robotic puppets and computer animation known as CGI. The effects on the dinosaurs are fantastic and impeccable. I really love the T-Rex scene where it attacks Lex and Tim in the tour vehicle and injures one of the group including Ian Malcolm and killing Donald Gennaro. The Tyrannosaurus rex is something that people are in awe with including the effects on the dinosaurs and that goes with the triceratops. The triceratops is made out of robotic animatronics like all the other dinosaurs. It looks like you're looking at a real dinosaur. Stan Winston and his team did a fantastic job on the visual effects. The CGI is been used previously in The Abyss and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Impressive, ain't it? The characters are really likeable and lovable and memorable. The actors did a really fantastic job on their portrayal on the characters. Sam Neill is Dr. Alan Grant is really good. He knows how dinosaurs extinct and what breed it is and does not like children but warms up to Lex and Tim, he's beginning to like children even more. He's such a great character. Laura Dern plays Dr. Ellie Sattler and that's all I can say about her. Jeff Goldblum plays Dr. Ian Malcolm who I think this character is a fan favourite by many people. He's a mathematician who specialise in chaos theory. Well, of course everybody knows the legendary Richard Attenborough as John Hammond. He passed away in a legendary age of 90. He's a billionaire philanthropist who Jurassic Park and the bioengineering company, InGen. He invites Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler to look at the cloning dinosaurs. He's a strong character. Two grandchildren, Lex and Tim who are John Hammond's grandchildren. They not annoying as many people said and that's how it works. Everybody remembers Samuel L. Jackson. I gotta say he says one line from which he said in Kong: Skull Island. \"Hold on to your butts.\" The music I gotta say is absolutely beautiful. And you all know it's he legendary John Williams. He creates memorable music in many films he done in. The theme of Jurassic Park BLEW people away and it's becoming of the John Williams best piece of music in the generation of the life time and my favourite of all time along with Jaws. There's one scene that I do love is where you see the brachiosaurus for the first time and when you see it, it's CGI and it's breath-taking and it's so motherf***ing satisfying to look at. When John Hammond says a memorable line \"Welcome to Jurassic Park.\" The music kicks in and you'll be in awe once you've seen the dinosaurs move in herds. Listen. This will never get out of your head every year every time you think about it. What can I say about Jurassic Park? Well, I gotta say, I love everything about it. I love the characters  the awesome story, fantastic special/visual effects, the directing style from one of my favourite directors of all time Steven Spielberg and the unforgettable music score by John Williams. You can't really go wrong, it is such an masterpiece! I can watch it over and over again without a fail and cannot deny it. It left me with awe and every time the Tyrannosaurus rex comes in and kills the raptors, it roars when the sign comes down saying \"When dinosaurs ruled the earth.\", it blew people away when they got out of the cinema years ago. Also, I would also recommend watching the special features and while you did that, you'll find a title called \"The Making of Jurassic Park\" and it's fantastic to look at. It's hosted by James Earl Jones and he tells that dinosaurs exist 65 million years ago. Jurassic Park is a biggest achievement for everyone who are in awe while they're in the roller coaster ride at the theme park. Good luck and welcome to Jurassic Park.",

Yes, some of the effects have dated as time moved on but the big memorable scenes, namely the T-Rex scene, are still very impressive.\nThis movie arguably kicked off the huge summer blockbuster/special effects extravaganza of the 90's and it has still not been topped!\nDue in large parts to other directors not understanding that you still have to make a compelling film with compelling characters and not just rely on CGI special effects.\n\nAs i said this is almost a blue print of how to make a movie like this. The set up to this movie over the first 15 minutes is swift but builds the expectation, it's brilliant. You know the dinosaurs are coming but Spielberg keeps his cards close to his chest. Much like in Jaws and it builds anticipation.\nOne of my favourite scenes is when they are all talikng about the moral implications of bringing back dinosaurs, it's a classic scene and Jeff Goldblum is on terrific form for most of the films early scenes...but all of this is entertaining because Spielberg's characters are compelling. This helps when the dinosaurs show up as we are invested in these characters.\n\nThe action in this movie is top notch. From the early T-rex scenes that still have you on the edge of your seat to the kids being chased around the kitchen by the velociraptors. All of the action in this movie is memorable and it is some of the best action sequences Spielberg had done since Raiders of the lost Ark.\n\nAn absolute delight to watch again and again and not one of the sequels has come within spitting distance of this movie.\nA classic.",

Deftly tying together thrilling action with prehistoric science fiction, Jurassic Park delivers terror like no film before it alongside an undercurrent of evolutionary philosophy. \n\nThe cast plays the right notes throughout, providing comedy and drama in equal measure. Jeff Goldblum is his Goldblumian best as Ian Malcolm, while Sam Neill and Laura Dern play nicely both together and apart. Richard Attenborough is a very Crichtonesque character himself, no doubt influencing Anthony Hopkins' performance as Dr. Ford in the HBO TV series Westworld.\n\nMy biggest trifle (and admitted excuse) for watching few films from past decades is that I am concerned their older cinematography and technical direction would mar my ability to enjoy the film. However, some films can overcome all of that and enter the annals of film history. Jurassic Park is such a film, timeless and to be enjoyed for generations to come.",

The film came out over two decades ago and looks better than most of what is produced in 2018. It looks that impressive. Spielberg's direction in this one is legendary. He's clearly having a blast with the wonder of having dinosaurs roam free. It's evident by some of his shots. Keeping with the more technical aspects of the film, John Williams provides one of the most memorable scores in cinema history. Sam Neil (Dr. Alan Grant) is a strong lead and the character being paired up with the kids was a smart move. He talks about not wanting kids throughout the film, but takes on a father figure role when things get tough, causing his growth. Jeff Goldblum (Dr. Ian Malcolm) is another standout from an acting perspective. Every scene is filled with something that matters, from character building to gorgeous shots to tense, pulse-pounding moments. It's a groundbreaking movie that is an absolute classic.\n\nWeaknesses: Laura Dern (Dr. Ellie Sattier) is relatively fine in her role, but she doesn't bring much to the table. It feels like she's kind of just there. That's just nitpicking at this point, though.\n\nOverall: I honestly forgot how great this was until I watched it again. There's a reason it's considered a classic. It has good writing and acting, but what makes it so incredible is everything else. The cinematography, the effects, and the terrific blend of horror, sci-fi, action, suspense, and even comedy.",

These long extinct creatures feel real as you witness Spielberg's camera pan across fields and indoor environments alike. The practical effects and puppetry is still top tier and realistic as when this movie was first released. The CGI is starting to look dated, but when it is mixed with the practical effects, you cannot even tell the difference.\n\nAlthough, Jurassic Park is overly long, you are entertained the entire movie. Jurassic Park remains as one of the most re-watchable films ever made. Families continue to pass this movie down generations as the effects still dazzle and the adventure still engages. Your sense of imagination is sparked by screeching dinosaurs and fearsome chase sequences. The moral parable aspect of Jurassic Park also still holds water as the ethical debate around controlling life with DNA and cloning conversation continues to this day.\n\nJohn Williams' score is so memorable and truly inspires awe right when you reach the island. The tense quiet passages meet with the uplifting rousing theme. I cannot imagine this movie being as successful with another score.\n\nThe acting is pretty solid throughout. No one besides Sam Neill, Richard Attenborough, and Jeff Goldblum really deliver incredible feats of acting, but they are very emotive. I like Laura Dern in Jurassic Park, but I feel like she overacts at times. B.D. Wong, Samuel L. Jackson, and Wayne Knight all play their part perfectly believable to their characters. The kids can get annoying, but they are the audience's viewpoint into Jurassic Park. You are supposed to empathize with their experiences. I think they did a respectable job, but often come across as amateur. Overall, nice casting and decent acting from the ensemble for Jurassic Park.\n\nIn the end, Jurassic Park is a classic science fiction adventure with many horror elements thrown in from time to time. It will always be fun and well intentioned even as the CGI ages poorly. The practical effects persist as realistic though as does the set design. You really think that this theme park could exist at least while the movie is playing. It's a fun ride for sure while Spielberg has more impressive outings, Jurassic Park will always be a favorite to this critic.",

            "content": "There's a line in a trailer for the upcoming sequel Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom in which Chris Pratt's Owen Grady asks, \"do you remember the first time you saw a dinosaur?\"\n\nI do.\n\nIt was twenty-five years ago, back in 1993, when I watched the original Jurassic Park in theaters for the first time. I was nine years old, and the dinosaurs seemed so real. It wasn't so much the CGI, though that was state-of-the-art and holds up shockingly well. It was the wonder of seeing something for the first time, the spectacle and power of prehistoric life on the big screen.\n\nWith that in mind, and the imminent arrival of said sequel, it felt more than appropriate to revisit Jurassic Park as it celebrates its silver jubilee.\n\nThe movie was such a landmark, its easy to forget it was based on an equally successful book by Michael Crichton. The relatively simple story didn't change much from page to screen. You all know it anyway:\n\nIdealistic promoter recreates hundreds of dinosaurs with preserved mosquito blood; group of scientists travels to exotic island for sneak peak at theme park of the resurrected beasts; things go terribly wrong; those visitors that don't get eaten spend the remaining time running and screaming.\n\nIt's funny-based on this description, the movie sounds like a disposable piece of horror schlock. Nothing could be further from the truth. But how?\n\nLet's start with the most obvious reason-it was directed by Steven Spielberg. And this at a time when he was in his prime, the king of Hollywood. He'd already made Jaws and E.T., and still had future hits like Saving Private Ryan and Lincoln to come. But while he delivered with expected, well-rounded expertise, there's one aspect of Spielberg's approach that's worth highlighting above all others.\n\nIt stems from the fact that Jurassic Park the novel is darker and more violent than the movie. In fact, James Cameron (The Terminator, Aliens) nearly nabbed the rights to direct the film instead. By his own admission, his version would've been more intense and graphic-closer to the source material, and almost certainly rated R.\n\nThat would've been interesting, but hardly suitable for most nine-year-olds. That's where Spielberg comes in. As with Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark and War of the Worlds, he possesses the special ability to create tension for all ages. Whether a child or adult, when you watch his movies your pulse is racing, nerves consistently brought to the brink but never over the edge. You leave the theater not afraid, but exhilarated, a smile of sheer energy spread across your face.\n\nBut he doesn't do it alone. There are so many other reasons why, a quarter-century later, Jurassic Park still feels new. Take John Williams' legendary score, which nearly upstaged the dinosaurs themselves and remains popular today. Or the way David Koepp's underrated script peppers in saving doses of humor (\"I'm always on the lookout for the next ex-Mrs. Malcolm\").\n\nWho were Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum before this movie? Certainly not household names. They were never really movie stars, either. Instead, they were-and are-skilled actors that lend Jurassic Park an envious on-screen pedigree among summer blockbusters. And despite many modern complaints of 'annoying' child stars, Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello have consistently avoided such a label. The credit is theirs, displaying a genuine combination of fascination and fear, making them simply what every actor hopes to be-part of the movie.\n\nLike Star Wars, Terminator 2 and Toy Story, Jurassic Park broke technological ground. But also like those movies, it connected with its audience beyond mere scale and pixels. This is why, twenty-five years later, we keep coming back to the original. And why its next twenty-five will roar just as loudly.",

Amazingly, they still hold up and look great. But what makes JP a 5* effort is the amazing suspense and technically great film making.\n\nBased on a script by Michael Crichton and David Koepp from the novel by Crichton, it starts off a bit slow, but the moment Nedry the computer nerd (Wayne Knight, unforgettable) turns off the power so that he can steal some dino embryos, the film pulsates with pace, aggression and genuine terror. The archeologist protagonist, Sam Neil, goes on a journey of self discovery to become the ideal father - by saving the awful John Hammond's (Richard Attenborough) grandchildren from Hammond's dino creations. Some critics criticised Spielberg for only killing off the minor characters while providing plot armour for the leads and the children - but imagine what the movie would have been like if the dinos were allowed to feast on Laura Dern or the poor kids. It would have been totally uncommercial and a much worse story. Instead, the kids in peril make the best suspense, whether trapped in the SUV while the T-Rex attacks, or the kitchen scene with the Velociraptors. These are great scenes, and there is enough blood shed  in the dino eating scenes to satisfy all but the most gruesome tastes. \n\nNot enough credit goes to the cast - of course Neil is solid, Dern is feisty, Attenborough full of remorse, Jeff Goldblum is fantastic, his barbed scepticism and wit makes the whole thing resonate and still relevant. \n\nAnd George Lucas's ILM provide the special effects, the first really fabulous CGI, to lift the dinos from lumps of plastic to really scary monsters. There is seamless integration between the real and CGI in this that makes his Star Wars prequels look so disappointingly unreal. But here, they are fantastic. \n\nHats off to Speilberg, the greatest film storyteller of the late 20th and early 21st Century. This really is one of his suspense masterpieces and  a beacon of bravura filmmaking.",

Steven Spielberg's  masterpiece summer blockbuster Jurassic Park proves that even a film from 1993 can stand toe to toe with some of today's biggest movies. Even in 2017, the realism captured with these dinosaurs is astounding. The way Spielberg combined incredible CGI and practical creatures, making them blend seamlessly with one another still amazes me. Jurassic Park isn't just a really fun dinosaur movie, from a characterization and storytelling standpoint, the film excels. It has likable characters (most notably Ian Malcolm and Muldoon), each with their own distinct personalities, and an absolutely riveting story which still keeps me hooked from beginning to end. The first two or three scenes are just a little dragging, but the film soon picks up. The T-Rex breakout scene, the velociraptors in the kitchen, and the first time we see the dinosaurs are three of cinema's best moments, all in one film. It even provides a somewhat scientifically sound reason for the whole concept to be plausible (and yes, when a PhD in genetics or paleontology examines it, there are sure to be dozens of plot holes, but at least they tried). Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, even in 2017.",

They have a great story line full of exciting action, and even a few scares to keep you on your toes. Jurassic Park does a great job of creating an awesome story of an attraction park that turns into a survival movie. This movie is visually phenomenal. They make everything look so real. The main actors are Richard Attenborough, Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern, Wayne Knight, Ariana Richards, Joseph Mazzello. Jurassic Park is supposed to be an attraction park on an island that lets tourists come and see all these exhibits that are full of various dinosaurs. The park did a trial run with a few tourists and during that trial run one of the researchers turned off the security fences to all the exhibits. When that happened, different dinosaurs got out of there exhibit, and started raving havoc all over the park. The tourists get stranded out in the park and must survive against the elements and all the predatory dinosaurs out to get them. Although not every dinosaur in the park was deadly and carnivores. The film also showed a lot of gentle giants that just eat plants.",

This films special effects are dazzling and at more moments than not still terrifying. Not only that but the actors and their acting is far above par. This Action film is a great movie and has truly captivated audiences for decades. However, this review is more about the editing in the film. \nThere are many parts that go into the making of a movie but editing is always a large\npart of making said movie.  It is perhaps most needed in movies with large animatronics and special effects. An example using this film could be how the editing between a T-rex and Jeff Goldblum invokes a sense of fear even from sitting on a couch. The Aesthetics used in the film are indeed works of wonder, however the masterful way in which they are edited are what truly give this film its terrifying and awe inspiring emotional response. The editing of the film allows the seemingly flawless transitions from character to character to dinosaur allowing these incredible actors to deliver their lines majestically. I would have to say however that one series of scenes in particular have phenomenal editing. (SPOILERS for this 1993 movie) The scene I am talking about comes at the end of the movie when the T-rex faces off against the raptors while the main protagonists escape. The edits make this battle of epic proportions truly come to life, whether it be the fighting or fleeing. \nKossak, 2\n\tThe Area Studies and Film was a bit lacking having no other languages aside from English during the film, despite its references to other regions. Just as well there isn't much backstory given about the characters. Unless you count dinosaurs themselves as backstory, then yes, it gives a lot. It also had an aspect ratio of 1:85:1 as to accommodate for the dinosaur animatronics. The film also set a new standard in the Art Cinema category with its incredible CGI and animatronics. \n\tFinally, after talking about some technical aspects of the film, as well as the editing. The overall rating, I would have to give this film would be a 9.5. It stands the test of time and Truly deserves its academy awards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKossak, 3\n\nWork Cited\nJohn316, 10-01-2002, 00:58\nhttp://forums.thedigitalfix.com/forums/showthread.php?t=46220",

            "content": "Today, 25 years after the release of the novel and 22 years after the first film, Universal Studios releases the latest blockbuster in the the Jurassic Park series, Jurassic World. While this new film is not based on a book, I thought it would be fun to take a look at the original Jurassic Park adaptation. Released in 1993 and based on the novel by author Michael Crichton, Jurassic Park was a groundbreaking summer blockbuster that shattered box office records and set a new standard for special effects in film.\n\nBy now, I think it is safe to say that almost everyone has seen Jurassic Park, or is at least familiar with the premise of the film. Like the novel, the film follows the story of an amusement park that is designed to display the fruits of a landmark scientific discovery. Through a painstaking process of collecting dinosaur DNA from petrified mosquitoes, scientists at InGen, led by John Hammond, are able to bring the extinct animals to life. Hammond's lawyers see enormous profitability, but urge him to have experts attest to the safety of the park. Hammond brings in Dr. Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler, paleontologists, and mathematician and chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm to tour the park and provide their expert recommendations.\n\nWhen the group of scientists first set eyes on the dinosaurs of the park, they experience awe and wonder at seeing the incredible creatures. In 1993, and I'd argue still to this day, the audience shares in these feelings. The buildup is perfectly timed to the fantastic payoff of finally seeing the animals on screen. Add to this the fact that Jurassic Park marks the first time CGI was ever used to create animals on film, and you can understand the power and historical significance of this moment. But this moment is not meant to last. As the film continues, all of the failsafe, man-made systems begin to malfunction and the animals begin to overtake the island.\n\nIn the hands of director Steven Spielberg, Jurassic Park is elevated from B-movie horror to a thoughtful commentary on morality in science. To be fair, the movie is pure escapist entertainment at its finest. The large set pieces are expertly crafted and the film plays as everything audiences have come to expect from a big-budget summer blockbuster. Still, on a larger level, the film questions the power of science and dares to show both the magnificent and terrifying effects it can have. In the end, it is a lack of respect for the science that leads to the human's demise. This disregard for consequence in favor of profit and entertainment, also brings forth an interesting point. After 20 years, Jurassic Park remains the pinnacle of an effects driven movie. Spielberg manages to strike the perfect balance in the film, employing effects that truly serve the story. As we find ourselves now with every blockbuster film saturated in CGI effects, it is interesting to note that this film, which had far less access to the technology that filmmakers currently enjoy, remains far superior to many of the films that have followed it (even two sequels). It is the respect of the filmmakers for the science at their disposal that makes the story and film one of the most enjoyable blockbusters of all time.",

It has a strong emotional core and that is the strength of \"Jurassic Park\". Watching it again for the first time in a decade made me realize how much practical effects were used in this visually revolutionary film. The film's only weakness is the two child actors. They annoyed the hell out of me the first time I saw it, and they still annoyed me this time too. But other than that, this is a really great film. Awe-inspiring, terrifying, and it's directed to near perfection. It's a cinematic triumph.",

            "content": "Quality: 7.5/10\nContent: 6/10\nBefore Jurassic World and two other sequels, there was Jurassic Park twenty-two years ago. It's good, to say the least, but not great -- well-made, but a typical action flick at its core. Though Spielberg really wished to induce amazement, he introduced the dinosaurs quite too early, mollifying the awe the characters - whom we have known for no more than ten minutes - display (and we should have felt). Based on the renowned Michael Crichton novel, Spielberg, David Keopp, and Crichton himself cut the story down to a simple and bloody nightmare.\n\nWe meet Dr. Grant, a dinosaur paleontologist (a power-filled performance by Sam Neil), and his fianc\u00e9e and assistant, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) working on a dinosaur excavation site. In a surprise visit, a mysterious, eccentric billionaire park owner, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), asks the two renowned archaeologists to endorse his new yet-to-launch, live dinosaur park. As they arrive at the park situated on a private island, they are joined by a mathematician Dr. Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), the \"blood-sucking\" lawyer Gennaro (Martin Ferraro) representing Hammond's investors, and Hammond's two grandchildren, Lex and Tim. But then, just as a foreseeing Dr. Malcolm observes, the park goes amuck due to the betrayal of the only IT guy capable of running the park.\n\nThe whole film can be enfolded by an exchange with the mathematician Dr. Malcolm first declaring: \"God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs.\" To which Dr. Ellie Sattler replies: \"Dinosaurs eat man. Woman inherits the earth.\" First, this story portrays man's destruction of God by creating dinosaurs; man became God and created and ruled their creations as a god, but what they created was superior to them. Secondly, Spielberg involves a forced female lead whose acting falls short of the magnitude of her role. Sure, strong female leads are great, but Laura Dern portrays Sattler as almost weak and gives overdone and exaggerated expressions radically different than her fianc\u00e9's near grim looks and demeanor. Even Dr. Malcolm could not see the chemical reaction between the couple.\n\nGranted, this is considered one of the most frightening movies ever made. But deeper than the action and near escapes are the themes of paternal love. The grim Dr. Alan Grant never truly smiles, never has a genuine, good laugh over anything and above all, enormously despises children. However, chance intervenes when Mr. Hammond brings his grandchildren along to be the first visitors to the not-yet launched park. But when everything goes amuck in the park and Gennaro ditches the children in an act of cowardliness, Grant bravely but reluctantly takes them into his custody, who in turn treat him to the joys of parenthood. \n\nSome of you may have even seen it in theatres in its release and noticed that the \"theater shook.\" Not surprisingly, Jurassic Park was the first major movie to use surround sound (simply sound that surrounds), bringing the petrifying sounds of the Jurassic period to the screen. With cars smothered in blood and gore, bodies eaten as fast as anchovies and intense struggle of man against his creation, no wonder Jurassic Park has such a bloodstained name on it. The language is no better; expletives drop as fast as the bodies. But cowardliness is avenged, and Dr. Grant finds his own fatherly instinct. Definitely, Jurassic Park is satisfying and the events frightening, but it falls away from the strength and complexity of the original novel.",

The plot to \"Jurassic Park\" is that a group of miners discover a mosquito frozen in tree sap from millions of years ago. Later a group of scientists get a hold of this they suck out the blood that the mosquito took from animals. The scientists discover that the mosquito had been carrying dinosaur D.N.A. The scientist then uses the D.N.A. to create living dinosaurs. But what the scientists don't know is shortly all hell will break loose. The plot to the movie is superb; the intro to the film is a thrilling and suspenseful opening to what will happen. During the movie we get to love \"Alan Grant\" portrayed by \"Sam Neill\" who is a caring person. \"Jurassic Park\" uses humour to make the movie even better; it is very successful at this. The acting in \"Jurassic Park\" is superb, \"Richard Attenborough\" and \"Laura Dern\" are perfect actors, the don't oversell their performances or have weak performances. \"Steven Spielberg\" and \"John Williams\" constantly work together to create some of cinema's very best music. The music \"John Williams\" created was extremely suspenseful. It may not be the very best he's done but it's still is great to listen to. For a movie made in 1993 using C.G.I. everywhere it would be expected that the special effects would look horrible to today's standards. The C.G.I. is excellent it's barely noticeable. \"Steven Spielberg\" is the master at directing and filming movies; \"Jurassic Park\" was filmed exceptionally. The scene where the dinosaur is chasing the car looks magnificent. If you are a person who enjoys \"Spielberg\" movies or Sci-Fi movies than I highly recommend you watch \"Jurassic Park\" as it is a classic, with amazing acting and stunning visuals. I give \"Jurassic Park\" a 9/10. The movie did have some issues, some scenes dragged on for a while, C.G.I. was great but a bit out of date.",

The quiet suspense of the kids in the car watching the cup of water as every few seconds it vibrates from a tremble like something stomping on the ground, and before you know it the movie really takes off.  This is without a doubt one of the most fun and exciting films that has ever been made.  In 1993 to see how real these dinosaurs looked was amazing.

It will likely be impossible to ever recreate that excitement and wonder I felt as a little guy for that type of big event blockbuster, but the residual nostalgia still provides a taste all these years later.\n\nAside from the dinos, John Williams is the MVP and creates such a memorable score that is still extremely recognizable almost thirty years later. Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough give enjoyable performances as well and are two I always look forward to.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson Binge: \"Hold onto your butts.\" This very small role would be a mostly forgettable performance from Jackson until he unsurprisingly takes that simple line and turns it into the most quoted one from this film.\n\nSLJ January #50",

I pulled the collar of my shirt up to my eyes and hoped the wailing raptor in that containment unit wouldn't escape right through the screen and into my lap. The night was dark, the wind was wild, and the enemy was waiting just around the corner. I was thrilled, and this moment created a life-long hunger for more.\n \nLet it be known that I'm no fan of the summer blockbuster film, especially these days. Typically they are lazy, bland, and take no risks. I was pleased while re-watching Jurassic Park to be reminded of the pre-Michael Bay years when the big summer action film possessed brains in equal measure to its CGI muscle. \n \nSpeaking of which, how do the visual effects in this film still look so good? The Phantom Menace was released six years after JP and those computer effects already look extremely dated. Aside from the technology being used in the cars and control center everything here stands up. Jurassic Park could be released today and inspire as much awe as it did  in 1993.\n \nThere's nothing really to critique here, the film is a classic for a reason. Well cast, written, and acted with outstanding visual effects and near perfect pacing. There's drama, tension, action, and humor but, more importantly, Jurassic Park respects its audience. I'm a real asshole about movies but admit to being thrilled and joyfully entertained by this film so many years after first seeing it.\n \nAll praise withstanding I must also acknowledge that it feels a lot like Raiders of the Lost Ark with dinosaurs. Sam Neill is Indy without the sex appeal and Spielberg has replaced the boulder chase with a charging t-rex. Who could blame him? It ain't broke.",

It's easy to nitpick the minor details about this movie, and overlook the little nuances showcased by Stephen Spielberg that made him one of the best directors of all time. This is probably the biggest movie at a time when he was at the top of his game.\n\nThe plot itself is silly. It's basic King Kong kind of stuff. The acting is negligible when you're basically required to run away from CGI dinosaurs.\n\nBut the visual effects, the shots, the pacing. It all wraps up so perfectly. The reason the CGI is still hailed today (even though it actually does look worse than modern CGI) is because they used it minimally and effectively. The t-rex looks amazing because most of the CGI is done in a night setting with tons of rain. There's a mix between animatronics and CGI that is edited seamlessly together to give the illusion of real dinosaurs. Spielberg also doesn't overexpose the dinosaurs. We see plenty of them, but the raptors for example don't even appear until over midway through the movie. The t-rex has big scenes, but only shows up at key scenes (three scenes only).\n\nAnd to top it all off, it's actually better than the book. Okay, maybe not \"better\" (that's kind of subjective in this case), but the movie is much tighter and well paced than the book. And the changes made from the book are actually improvements. The ending is much more satisfying.\n\nIf you go into this movie for the story, you'll be slightly let down. It's good and imaginative, but it's very silly too. But if you go in this movie for the spectacle and to see one of the best directors of all time at his peak? This is a must-see.",

And recently a friend of mine pointed out that Dr. Grant ties two female ends of seat belts together to strap himself in which is a great metaphor for this motif of the dinosaurs supposedly being all female.\n\nThese philosophical aspects, including the amazing scene focusing on a debate of whether it is responsible to try to add dinosaurs back into the swing of things altogether, raise the movie up higher than the mere B movie critics believe it to be. But is there anything wrong with the overall fun and excitement of this seemingly simple people? We see dinosaurs on-screen for the first time in a much different way - both with the use of animatronics and digitally. We also have the quirky characters such as Wayne Knight and Jeff Goldblum's characters to add to the fun.\n\nThe film is pretty aware of itself, making references to King Kong and displaying the dinosaurs as a spectacle to future park-goers, just as the idea of the effects to make the dinosaurs are a spectacle to us as movie-goers. It also draws attention to its potential horror towards little kids with Dr. Grant illustrating the idea of a velociraptor to a cocky kid, and the grandkids that tag along for the park ride that are shown screaming on-screen.\n\nWhat a great, underrated movie by Spielberg.",

Based on the novel of the same name by Michael Crichton Jurassic Park follows two dinosaur experts Sam Neill's Dr. Alan Grant and Laura Dern's Dr. Ellie as they are invited by eccentric millionaire John Hammond to preview his new amusement park on an island off Costa Rica by cloning DNA harvested from pre historic insects where Hammond creates living dinosaurs for his new attraction known as Jurassic Park where tourists gets to see lots of dinosaurs that were extinct many years ago. But soon one of the employees turns against Hammond by messing with the park's system which results with the dinosaurs escaping. And soon Dr. Alan Grant and Richard Hammond's grandchildren must escape the island as all the dinosaurs wreck havoc in the park. When I first heard of the Jurassic Park series right after watching the fourth film in the Jurassic Park series Jurassic World. I became so interested with the Jurassic Park movies and when I finally got the chance to watch the original Jurassic Park I was stunned and amazed. Seriously, Jurassic Park is one of the best films about dinosaurs and it is my personal favorite Steven Spielberg film since Poltergeist. It is so cool how Steven Spielberg created such an amazing movie that everyone will never forget. What I love about Jurassic Park is that this movie is seriously intriguing from start to finish and it is the film that can seriously entertain both kids and adults at the same time and the overall concept is very intriguing and cool. The other things I like about this movie is how Spielberg created the film and he was able to execute the movie in a very good way there is nothing dull with it at all, everything in this movie is perfect thanks also to the screenplay by David Koepp and Michael Crichton himself. The movie is also full of so many scenes that are so memorable and very intense, plus suspenceful at the same time(The opening sequence, the marvelous sequence where the dinosaur egg hatched, the first appearance of the T-Rex, The scene where the T-Rex attempts its first attack, the super thrilling sequence with the car hanging in the tree, scenes with the raptors, the intense electric fence scene and the finale where the T-Rex saves the day). The other Highlights of the film is the settings of the movie and I love the look and feel of the film, it feels as if the park is there and it really exists at the same time. It gives the movie the feeling that you are in the park because the park looks so beautiful and gorgeous at the same time, plus the Jurassic Park theme song(which was used also in some of the sequels) is so heartwarming and the cinematography is beautiful and we get to see loads of wonderful and glorious views within the film itself and there are loads of magnificent landscapes and tight shots at the same time. But the true main highlight of this movie is the dinosaurs and the special effects itself. I love all of the dinosaurs in this movie and my personal favorite dinosaur in the film is the T-Rex and the raptors they are by far the most terrifying dinosaurs in the movie while I also love the other dinosaurs like the Bracheosaurus, Triceratops etc... and the effects itself are so amazing and beautiful. The idea of combining animatronics and CGI makes the look of the dinosaurs look so realistic and I love how the dinosaurs were designed in the film and the way they move is so realistic as well. Plus the CGI is so top notch I would definitely say that Jurassic Park is also the film that introduced CGI. This is an example of a movie that handles the CGI properly and every special effect worked really well in the film at the same time, it seriously gave the film a strong feel and of course a proper look thanks to the movie's impressive quality we get an excellent movie with a proper execution. Now the acting is superb, all of the casts in this movie did an amazing job with their work on this movie and all of them deliver the best performances in film history. Sam Neill did an amazing job with his performance as Dr. Alan Grant the same can be said to Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Alan Grant's partner and girlfriend. The late Richard Attenborough delivers one of his best performances ever as Richard Hammond the park owner, the same can be said to Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm and its also nice to see Samuel L. Jackson in one of his earliest and best performance before he portrayed Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe while the rest of the casts did an amazing job with their performances as well. Director Steven Spielberg created an extraordinary and thrilling movie that captures the heart and strength of every kid who wants to learn about dinosaurs and Spielberg managed to turn David Koepp and Michael Crichton's screenplay into a beautiful movie with loads of memorable moments and it also acts as one of the best films of the 90's at the same time. Overall Jurassic Park is a fun and superb Adventure film that delivers loads of thrills and tension from start to finish and this is the best installment in the Jurassic Park series since Jurassic World. This movie gets a 10.5/10.",

The characters have become iconic and quotable, the scenes have been used across all forms of media, and it still wows to this day. Acting wise, we have a solid cast that just meshes well.

            "content": "Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest directors of all time. To this day, Schindler's List is-in my humble opinion-his best film. Spielberg has produced so many iconic movies in the past thirty years, including Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and E.T. He is one of the kings of special and practical effects. He has made a profound impact on me as an aspiring filmmaker. \"Jurassic Park'' is the iconic adventure film-directed by Spielberg. It's considered by many to be one of-if not his best-movies made. It stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, and Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nDuring a desert excavation, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil) and Dr. Ellie Sattler (Dern) are unexpectedly visited. The visitor is John Hammond (Attenborough), director of bioengineering company, InGen. Hammond has come to offer Grant and Sattler a trip to his dinosaur theme park: Jurassic Park. Agreeing to come with, the two paleontologists are amazed at the real life dinosaurs that await them. In the lab, they discover that scientists have been breeding and creating dinos. Somewhat suspicious of the project, Hammond offers them a special tour of the theme park. Not far into the tour, Grant and Sattler come across sick dinosaurs. Many of the stops on their trip are vacant of any dinosaur activity. Unfortunately, a t-rex has been causing problems all over the park, and the tourists must struggle to stay alive when an unexpected visitor breaks through the fence.\n\nThis film is widely considered to be a kind of cult classic-and it really is one. I've never had so much fun watching a film like I did watching this one. First of all, the characters are really likable. Alan Grant is the steadfast leader. He knows all about dinosaurs and their behavior, giving him an advantage when trying to survive. Accompanying Grant are two children who love dinosaurs, yet are naturally very afraid of them. It was really sentimental when Grant was teaching the kids about the dinosaurs. Previously in the film, he stated that he and his wife didn't wish to have children, so the bonding that they shared was really heartwarming. However, my favorite character in the film had to be Dr. Ian Malcolm. He was really witty and funny, delivering some of the most memorable lines in the movie.\n\nI can imagine what it was like sitting in the theater in 1993, watching this movie for the first time. It must have been an incredible experience. The special effects are really incredible. In this day and age, it's easy to not appreciate visual effects, and especially practical effects. We are so acostumned to great visuals that we aren't as impressed by them.  However, look at the stunning visuals in James Cameron's, Avatar or in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. This film has an amazing animatronic t-rex. It was a heart pounding thrill ride from beginning to end. \n\nAs an action adventure film, this is one of the best I've ever seen. Spielberg directs the film so well. The script is full of fantastic humor and dialogue, as well as quirky and memorable characters. Spielberg and composer John Williams have been working together for years, and his score for this film is just as memorable and iconic as his previous work with the director. \n\n\"Jurassic Park\" is a bit cheesy, and some of the special effects (CGI) are somewhat outdated. Nevertheless, this is an impressive film for it's time. It's funny, well written, and visually inventive. Spielberg's theme park adventure film is something anyone can enjoy, young and old. It's a cult classic-some would even say a masterpiece-that has stood the test of time.",

            "content": "Michael Crichton broke incredible ground with Jurassic Park the novel. Combining cutting-edge science with a believable premise and an intriguing message made for some truly spectacular reading in book form. If you have not yet read the book, I urge you to do so, as the suspense is excellent, and the story feels more complete.\n\nSpielberg has made an excellent film here. Weaving the science-heavy story in with stunning visuals is tricky enough, but he manages do develop the human characters, and keep the threat of dinosaurs all too real. There is a great tonal shift, as the beginning of the film is awe-inspiring and optimistic, but this gives way to a horror feel at a certain point. This is not a horror film per se, neither is it a 'creature-feature'.\n\nThere is a mix of acting here. Sam Neill doesn't sell it too well here, and the kids are kind of annoying. Laura Dern is good, showing her character's sunny disposition. Richard Attenborough plays Hammond well, and Jeff Goldblum makes Ian Malcom memorable.\n\nThis is the film that inspired a whole generation of dinosaur fans. It has a cool premise, great visuals, and a suspenseful story that never loses sight of its message.",

            "content": "Rating-9.5/10\n\nJurassic Park is a blockbuster film, and blockbuster that is done very well indeed. It's the kind of movie where you might see the synopsis and think it looks like seen before film, but this is different in a few ways. The emotion that runs through is beautiful, not to mention the thrills the dinosaurs give you too, the characters first view of the dinosaurs is fantastic and well acted, the park so well designed \n\nSteven Spielberg is the mind behind the picture and he commands this in a way any big budget director can only dream of emulating. He seems to just know what to do, in every scene, and to be fair say what you say about the script in this one, Spielberg bashes out a film that probably doesn't even need a decent script. And on to that script, Spielberg gets everything he can out of it. He absolutely pulls it all out and even if fans of the original Michael Crichton novel dislike this, you can't deny Spielberg does well.\n\nFor me there are two stand out performances, Sam Neill and Richard Attenborough. First of all Neill as Palaeontologist Dr Alan Grant is good, he seems to make this film more personal and less big budget, he brings you closer to the characters and just does his job well. Attenborough is just fine in his role John Hammond, owner of the Jurassic park. He knows what he is doing, a fine performance from a true great and he makes this movie even more memorable too.\n\nI think this is just good fun, don't take the whole plot too seriously and you will massively enjoy this, this isn't a major award winner type movie but bits an pieces maybe do deserve great recognition. The effects used are just fantastic, and this is for 1993 as well, just top top work and really set a bar in my opinion. The animatronics of the dinosaurs are so well done, so well designed and so well, well moved in a sense. The animals are scary in this, not overly so don't fear for the kids being frightened, but it might just a little. \n\nI think reason this is such a classic is the way in which it can just be pretty slow and un-eventful then BOOM!, suddenly a huge T-Rex is running round or smashing the hell out of a car or something, it's actually good fun. It's characters like Jeff Goldblum's who make this funny and less serious, he cracks jokes at the scariest of times and some of his one two's with Sam Neill and Laura Dern(Ellie Sattler) are just brilliant. I think yet again Steven Spielberg directs the actors in a way that suits this movie brilliantly, they just blend well and Spielberg gets the absolute most out of them.\n\nIf you want a serious kind of drama movie(that somehow includes dinosaurs), then don't watch this, but If you want crazy all out thrills, with good acting, special effects and of course directing, this is all for you. I couldn't recommend this more to people, it is just such a good adventure, so well cast and the chemistry between everyone is just great, and again here comes that word, fun.\n\nOverall an incredible movie, for me possibly one of the best of all time, definitely one of the best thrillers and the number one dinosaur based movie by miles. Give it a go and see if like me you find this amazing, and then you'll see just how much attention you'll give this film.",

It's an amazing experience that everyone should see if you love cinema.  The characters are great and fun, it's grand, it's suspenseful, and the effects look monumental.  These are among some of the best effects I've seen on film.  \nThe music is also iconic and has a lot to do with why the film is as good as it is.  John Williams, in my opinion, is the greatest composer to come out of Hollywood.  He's done some of the most iconic themes in movies.  You have Jurassic Park, The Lost World, The Star Wars films, The Indiana Jones films, Superman The Movie, Home Alone, among others.  He is a legend in the world of music.\nThe cast is great as well.  I often feel like these people are very underappreciated.  Of everyone in the cast the one who has gone on to do the most by far is Samuel L. Jackson.  Jeff Goldblum was big for a bit after this film but he pretty much went nowhere by the 2000s.  He also gets a lot of shit from critics now which I feel is undeserved as I actually like him as an actor.  \nSam Neil hasn't done much either in the 2000s at least as far as American films go.  He's done some TV shows which went nowhere.  I feel he's one of the most underappreciated actors as he's personally one of my favorites.  \nThe same applies with Laura Dern who's probably one of my favorite actresses.  Richard Attenborough also does a great job as John Hammond.  He is greatly missed.  The rest of the cast does good work as well.\nOverall, if you want a grand and epic experience or just want to see a great monster movie than here you are.  Hell, if you're a fan of dinosaurs in general than this is the movie to watch.  This and Land Before Time made me fascinated with dinosaurs as a kid.  It was one of my favorite films then and now.",

I can say this: the modern CGI doesn't have to be better than the old. Jurassic Park is one eye popping movie! The combination with dinosaurs and the music is really something. It made the movie magical and almost touching! Most of the plot is built on teases, it wasn't until the end of the second act the action really began. The small teases of dinosaurs is awesome, made the movie great! The plot it also a bit mysterious and it does have some ethical and deep messages to carry on. It made the movie epic, more than what I expected.\n\nThe directing is flawless. The cinematography is superb, especially in the opening scene! It's the same with the actors; awesome. The only negative aspects are that the CGI is a bit vague (and the practical effects) and that it took too long for the movie to really start. But also that the ending was a bit too sudden.

Today, there are some people that consider this film an \"overrated generic Hollywood blockbuster with a Spielberg touch\" and they have a point as this film has been imitated to death in the last twenty years but this is a summer blockbuster done right due to all the elements I mentioned before. \n\"Jurassic Park\" is definitely a film that lives up its enormous reputation of a modern classic. While this is by no means one of Spielberg\u00b4s greatest films, it is one of his best blockbusters. Arguably one of the greatest blockbusters ever made. An unforgettable film that will continue to impress audiences in years to come.",

Man creates dinosaurs.\"\n \nSince we're only a couple of days away from the premiere of Jurassic World I wanted to share some thoughts on one of my all time favorite movie going experiences (perhaps my favorite). I was only 12 years old when Steven Spielberg released Jurassic Park in 1993 and from the second the movie started I was at the edge of my seat. From the breathtaking and groundbreaking visuals, to the outstanding cast, and the magnificent score everything about Jurassic Park made me fall in love with it. The dinosaurs had come to life before my very eyes, and Spielberg masterfully wrote a thrilling script that had me sweating for two full hours. I can never forget the thrills I felt during the T-rex scene and that final climax with the velociraptors in the museum's kitchen. I remember thinking there was no one cooler than Sam Neill's Alan Grant and I wanted to be Tim Murphy (played brilliantly by Joseph Mazzello). The rest of the cast was also amazing: Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Ariana Richards, Bob Peck, and Samuel L. Jackson. Many will consider Jaws as Steven Spielberg's most terrifying film, but for me it was Jurassic Park because I got to experience it on the big screen and it was my first memorable experience at a theater. I had seen many other films that had made an impact on me prior to this (Star Wars, The Goonies, Raiders of the Lost Arc, and E.T.) but none in a theater, so Jurassic Park holds that nostalgic value and it will forever remain one of my favorite films. It also became the first film I went to see again at a theater because I couldn't get enough of this world. There are so many quotable lines from this movie and many memorable scenes, and I realize it is going to be impossible for Jurassic World to live up to that standard but I am still highly anticipating it while I relive some of my childhood memories with Jurassic Park. It's a masterpiece.",

It takes a concept that could have been a simple B-movie, and brings it to life as something more.\n\nThe plot revolves around a man who brings scientists to endorse his new and creation -- a theme park where the attractions are cloned dinosaurs. However, an attempt to smuggle dinosaur DNA, leads to a power outage. The dinosaurs break free, and everybody's lives are in danger.\n\nThe film was revolutionary at the time for it's special effects. This movie popularized the use of CGI by showing dinosaurs that looked very realistic. And more than twenty years later, amazingly, the effects still hold up today.\n\nNow if there's one thing that director Steven Spielberg is good at, it's putting a sense of childlike wonder in his films, and this is prevalent in the first half hour of this film. This shows the park in all of it's majesty, before things went horribly wrong. The dinosaurs all look amazing, and it keeps you dazzled and entertained even before anything bad happens. You'll probably want to actually go to the park... I mean besides the whole getting killed by dinosaurs thing.\n\nWhen the s--t does hit the fan, it is very intense. These scenes done in a very different manner than what he had done with his breakout film, Jaws. In Jaws, the shark was rarely shown, and this made the sequences it was in more tense. In this movie, he shows the dinosaurs in all of their glory. This method usually doesn't work in movies, but this is one of the few exceptions. The direction of these sequences keep tensions high as the people try to escape.\n\nIn conclusion, Jurassic Park is a classic, that stays intense and spectacular throughout. The visuals are amazing, the action is thrilling, and the direction is great. In short, yes, it's as good as you probably remember.\n\nJaythemovieguy.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Crichton = Thriller, Spielberg = Adventure\n\nThis is one of those issues where reading the book before seeing the movie is going to give you a different perspective on things. I read Michael Crichton's novel first, and enjoyed it much more than Spielberg's movie.\n\nCrichton wrote a very R-rated thriller that was dark and terrifying. You felt like you were trapped on that island with those people. And, instead of off-screen or \"Godzilla\"-like violence, Crichton had people getting eviscerated, etc. In the movie, Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp (who I think is AWFUL!), have Tyrannosaurs miraculously saving people and so on. \n\nIn the novel, people are trapped in the dark, having to use their wits to survive. The bottom line is that the novel is a hard-core thriller, and the movie is an adventure film.\n\nSo, if the adventure thing works best for you, then you're in luck with Spielberg. But, if you wanted the dark horror, you go with Crichton. I go with Crichton.\n\nWhat I remember most when seeing this is that it was the first movie where digital sound was synced with the film print. And, when the Tyrannosaur shows up in the rain to attack, I know you're supposed to be terrified, but I was applauding wildly, absolutely floored by the Visual Effects!\n\nOtherwise, this is a pretty typical Spielberg production: Flat cinematography, lots of push ins to actors' faces, precocious children that are subsequently set upon by dinosaurs, ghosts, etc., overripe acting by hammy actors, etc. I know you're supposed to want the children to be saved. I just wanted them to be eaten!\n\nI would be much better if someone remade this as Crichton wrote it. Supposedly, Crichton had thought about directing it, but was very uncertain about handling the Visual Effects. But, since this movie is basically \"Westworld\" with dinosaurs, I think he could have pulled it off.",

The park is first showcased as potential visitors would discover it, they see the dinosaurs, then learn how they're made, before everything start to go awry.\n\nThe film plays with our fears of the unseen because in a good portion of it we don't actually see the scary dinosaurs being scary. We hear them, we know they are lurking off camera but we don't actually see them. It's such a good build up that when we see \"the monsters\" it's scary. My heart was racing like the little child I was when I first saw it. The suspense is one of the things that get you, even more than the few jump scares the movie has.\n\nWatching Jurassic Park now  made me realize how smart the plot is. lt plays on concerns people would have if this park was really about to open. Some characters only have dollar signs in their eyes and others see it as something incredible that can turn deadly, which it does but it doesn't take away from the fact that it could be wonderful.\n\nThe special effects in this film look as good now as they were when the movie first came out. My guess is that they used a lot of practical effects, animatronics and great camera shots to make us believe that these dinosaurs are real. It thought me that even the most incredible things can be dangerous.\n\nJurassic Park is such a good movie, it was for a long time the closest thing to an horror movie that I could watch. The film is great fun and very much enjoyable now. @wornoutspines",

That is what an adventure of a lifetime feels like. There are some CGI made on this film. Though it is pretty well made at the time. The clever dialogue which makes the script writing more brilliant and has a lot of meaning about it. You're watching an epic adventure at the same time you're learning from it.

            "content": "Based on Michael Crichton's novel of the same name and nothing short of a filmmaking masterpiece, Jurassic Park was the modern introduction for cinemagoers to the long lost prehistoric world that was brought to life with the right mixture of animatronics and CGI from the mind of critically acclaimed director Steven Spielberg, as the film is further elevated by its spectacular performances. Going on to create a cultural obsession with dinosaurs and a franchise with everything from three sequels, comic books and video games, Jurassic Park was, evidently, a hit.\n\nEmploying themes and ideas that would largely go lost on children that watched it in 1993 - or even now -, and an array of dinosaurs, Jurassic Park appeals to a wide berth of audiences, from adults right down to the children who would go on to become infatuated with the prehistoric life forms (and the merchandizing that comes with them). Utilizing a proper mix of CGI - for certain dinosaurs or situations - and animatronics, Spielberg's Jurassic Park doesn't have much to do in terms of successfully suspending disbelief at a visual level when it comes to animating the wide variety of dinosaurs.\n\nStanding apart from their fellow dinosaurs, the T-Rex and the Velociraptors have turned into a vicious mainstay of the franchise, as they consistently wreak havoc on the humans (and other timid dinosaurs) in all three movies through an utterly unpredictable and menacing nature. Like how the allure of strong horror movies lies on both the horror and human element equally, Spielberg's Jurassic Park doesn't singularly rely on just the dinosaurs, as the humans play a role just as important as their scaly co-stars in the central narrative.\n\nDrawing on the immense talent of the adult cast of actors - from Sam Neill to fan favourite Jeff Goldblum -, Jurassic Park captures the thematic quandaries that comes with John Hammond's park and the genetic tampering of dinosaurs, as the characters either argue or project their varied thoughts on the matter, from Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler's initial gushing over the dinosaurs to Ian Malcolm's highly realistic projection of disdain towards Hammond's idealistic, primordial nonsense, as all characters help project the spectrum of thoughts from the audience in Crichton and Koepp's terrific writing.\n\nWhile much of the grimdark and violent source material by Crichton were either removed or altered to fit Spielberg's vision of having Jurassic Park appeal towards a younger audience - with screenwriter David Koepp coming on board to rework the earlier scripts were also conceived by Crichton -, the core themes of the humans playing God through science persist and translate fantastically even in this day and age where they remain as relevant as ever.",

            "content": "1993's Jurassic Park was groundbreaking on so many levels. It features special effects that, 22 years later, have me saying, \"Wow! That's incredible!\" At that time, filmmaking was really reaching a pinnacle in realistic effects. Animatronics and puppetry are way more believalbe than strictly computer generated imagery. And since Hollywood went in the direction of CGI rather than the former, many films have lost their authenticity. There's a reason why the original Star Wars trilogy has fans' hearts more than the prequel trilogy--the movies feel more real. It creates a world more believable.\n\nAnd with the unprecedented effects going into this movie, we really do see the height of that technology used onscreen. The genuineness exceeds that of most current sci-fi action films.\n\nSteven Spielberg and his team create a world so realistic that we forget it doesn't exist. This is a pure adventure film and a real rush. It's anything but cliche, and the characters don't make annoying decisions trying to survive the dinosaurs.\n\nThe only thing that may be missing from this film is really solid character development. We get interesting scenarios that question certain characters' morals. But the written-in subplots in order to show depth, for the most part, feel like they're just written-in.\n\nBut we have a film that we can't really complain about. We'll sacrifice a little depth for a story and script that are so gripping that the film doesn't feel the least bit dated over 2 decades later. Now THAT is incredible!\n\nTwizard Rating: 100",

            "content": "I don't consider Jurassic Park a Spielberg classic. It doesn't have the same sense of youthful wonder his more accomplished films had like Close Encounters of The Third Kind. The scene where Richard Dreyfuss is in his car and the lights stop behind then fly away, that scene is more exhilarating than anything in Jurassic Park. Seeing the dinosaurs is cool, but the only time they really come alive for me are the death scenes -- such as Wayne Knight in the rain and mud looking for the DNA canister with a raptor toying with him. The only interesting parts of the movie are the glimpses we get of the behavior of the dinosaurs, and when we get clues to how they think. Knight's death was very enjoyable for people looking for that kind of insight. It's my favorite scene in the whole movie. \n\nThere's not much going on besides the action and the commercial appeal of the park itself. Jeff Goldblum is the best character. He gets the movie an extra star from me because in many scenes he actually points out the flaws in the film and you realize without the flaws you wouldn't have his witty commentary. He's seems self-aware and oblivious at the same time. The kids also stand out. Too often in action movies kids are just there to scream and be in danger and be saved, but the kids here get some character development and are just as important to the story as the adults. That's a trademark of older Spielberg movies. If he wasn't making movies he'd probably be a children's entertainer. Of course, the stars of the show are the dinosaurs. They're awesome and their action scenes are intense. Unfortunately, the majesty of seeing them is forced instead of implied so it isn't as powerful as it could have been. It's an action movie, and I think Spielberg did do a pretty good job with the limited amount of time he had to marvel at the world he created.",

The dinosaurs are brought to life flawlessly- so well that the creature effects 100% hold up today, still looking much better than many recent films (and in 4k I might add). The story is perfectly paced, setting up things flawlessly in the first half so that when shit hits the fan in the second half, you are fully invested. These are some of Spielberg's most fully realized characters, portrayed brilliantly by the cast- there is no bad performance to be found here. The writing is so smartly crafted that no second of screen time is wasted. Almost every bit of dialogue, and everything you see happen before the dinosaurs break loose- has some sort of payoff for when they mayhem begins. The T-Rex sequence could arguably be the single most impressive & terrifying blockbuster action scene ever made. This movie reminds me why I love movies so much, and never fails to thrill even though I've seen it countless times",

They might hate it, they might love it. But one thing is: no one can ignore it. Jurassic Park, based on the book by Michael Crichton, is simply one of the greatest films of all time. The film, a little over 21 years old at the \ntime this review has been published, is not only one of Steven Speilberg's greatest works, but is also his highest grossing film. The plot seems pretty simple: a group of geneticists extract dinosaur DNA from mosquitos and create dinosaur clones. John Hammond, a billionaire entrepreneur, then creates an amusement park which allows tourists to see dinosaurs. Sounds like a great idea, right? Ian Malcom doesn't seem to think so. Malcom, along with palienotologist Dr. Alan Grant, and a few others, go to the park to get a preview of it. A lawyer accompanies them; if he deems the park dangerous, he's shutting it down. So it all goes well until Dennis Nedry, one of the park's staff, shuts down all security measures in the park, letting the dinos go loose. This serves as a distraction for him, so he can get dino embryos and sell them for over a million dollars. His plan foils; and the park is destroyed by the havoc causing dinos, who also claimed a few lives along the way. \n\nThe movie is simply brilliant. While some may focus on hidden agendas, other simply enjoy the thriller-with-horror-elements and the dinos running amok as the tiny humans try to escape. Whatever your case may be, we can all agree that combined with the fantastic score, amazing acting and great script, as well as the breathtaking CGI and it's brilliant merging with animatronics, that the entire movie is utterly jaw dropping--a classic that we all know and love. From the scary T-Rex roaring in the warm summer night's pouring rain, to the highly intelligent velociraptors hunting down every last human, this movie is definitely a great treat for dino experts, horror cravers, thrill seekers, and even casual movie watchers.",

My jaws are dropping with those huge and awesome dinosaurs and just feel awed every single time. 21 years later watching this one still on home video, but on hi-def Blu-ray version. Now we're definitely talking. It is just mind blowing when those wild dinosaurs appeared especially the T-Rex scene.  How impressive robotics were made at this time. What if this is all true and it is happening. Dinosaurs being DNA'd and put back to life. All of the sudden you are trapped in an island of these giants. That is what an adventure of a lifetime feels like. There are some CGI made on this film. Though it is pretty well made at the time. The clever dialogue which makes the script writing more brilliant and has a lot of meaning about it. You're watching an epic adventure at the same time you're learning from it. Visually impressive and one of the most memorable adventure epics not only in the 90's but still at this moment. Never I doubted it has reigned at the box office for years. 4.5 stars out of 5.",

Its creative story and outstanding effects (which still live up even today) bring every little kid's dream of seeing dinosaurs to life. This movie is filled with scenes of aw and suspense, like the kitchen scene with the raptors. I do enjoy all of the characters in this film but I do feel that some aren't very developed, like the guy who tells Newman to steal the embryos from the park, who was he? But the real star of this film is of course the T-Rex with his iconic roar and massive size. Jurassic park is an exciting ride that is Dino-mite.",

            "content": "One of the all-time great imaginative entertainments, and in its own way one of the most important movies ever.  Entirely new possibilities were opened up by its pioneering use of visual effects, and what is truly amazing is how well the effects have held up; there is nothing that seems to have aged at all, even as effects have become more advanced by the year.  It is impossible to overstate the impact this movie had on the public when it was first released; it was as if something only seen on Star Trek had burst into reality. And It isn't just the effects. This movie is wonderfully constructed. The well-conceived plot unfolds at an ideal pace, with anticipatory tension, and scenes which are kinetic and scary.  \n\nJurassic Park is a film rich with classic Sci-fi themes, centering on reckless overreach in search of a grand, elusive goal. It isn't a movie about hubris, though hubris is certainly involved.  It is really about the allure of a personal dream, an allure that can be impossible to resist, but also impossible to fully realize in a way one can control. It is interesting that a film about the damage wreaked by a relentless attempt to realize one's imagination is itself a complete fulfillment of imagination.\n\nThe acting is well-suited for the film.  Sam Neill is a particular favorite of mine; There are few actors who I have more fond childhood associations with.  I'm also a fan of Jeff Goldblum, who is always a welcome presence, as is Laura Dern and the late Sir Richard Attenborough, who as the Park's creator conveys the almost childlike wonder which drives his foolhardy quest to re-enchant the world.  Perhaps this is part of the resonance of this particular film.  I find myself far more sympathetic towards John Hammond than one would assume I should be.  in today's world, we are fixated on innovation but have little room for wonder.  Among people of letters, the dominant goal is deconstruction, and there is a sense that nothing in human experience can be enchanted anymore, because we've taken everything apart.  This is likely illusory, but it and similar experiences had become pervasive in the collective mindset by the 90's, and remain so.  There is something so pure and wonderful about the passion that drives Mr Hammond, as foolish and destructive as it ends up becoming.  All he wants is to share his unsullied sense of wonder with the world.  His failure is in the necessity to exercise a level of control that no human can possess.  It doesn't really matter that the science described in the film isn't actually possible (due to DNA's relatively short shelf life).  The immutable truth here regards the limits of our ability to control nature.  Its a Tolkienish lesson, that our desires aren't the problem, it is having means at our disposal that exceed our natural limitations, because those limitations are a big part of who we are.  They must be recognized and accepted to be sane.  Yet it is in our nature to continue to open up Pandora's Box and be engulfed once again in unforeseen chaos, ever the result of both our natural curiosity, and our futile attempt to control and change the natural order.  \n\nBut is it a lovely dream.  At the end of the movie, as the airplane flies away from the island, with that wondrous soundtrack in the background (one of my favorite musical scores ever), the face of the mad dreamer John Hammond tells it all: his sadness at the catastrophe he has engineered is there, but we also can tell he'll always treasure that dream and never let it go. We'll never be able to bring back dinosaurs in actuality, nor should we try.  But we should treasure a movie which is so imbued with wonderment and imagination, and one which nurtured these qualities in the public, something that is more revolutionary than even its visual wizardry.",

David Koepp and Micheal Crichton were in charge of putting the screenplay together which would explain why it followed the book so well.  If you haven't read the book I suggest you do because it is an amazing book, now back to the movie.  In this movie during a preview tour, the park suffers a major power breakdown during a bad storm that allows all of the dinosaur to break free of their exhibits and run free.\n\nOn the island of Isla Nublar, a new park has just been built with genetically engineered dinosaurs. They are transporting in some of those dinosaurs when one of the workers is killed by a velociraptor. The founder of the park, John Hammond, (Richard Attenborough) is forced to get an inspection of the park due to this incident and he requests Paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and his assistant, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) to come to the park and ensure that it is safe. Hammond's lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) is also joining them because he is the one that is requiring the inspection and he brought a chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum).  After a long bumpy helicopter ride they get to the island and they are amazed to discover that Hammond has actually created living dinosaurs.  Even though amazed everyone but the lawyer have their doubts. Later, Hammond's grandchildren Lex and Tim (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello) join the group to take a tour of the park. While on the tour the come in contact of an ill triceratops and Sattler leaves the tour to take care of her.  Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) who wishes to steal embryos from the park to sell to a secret buyer sets up a program that shuts off all the power to the park except the velociraptors paddock. Due to this selfish act, many dinosaurs escape their paddocks, including the deadly Tyrannosaurus Rex, who, during a thunderstorm, escapes his paddock and attacks the cars on the tour. Malcolm is injured & Grant and the children are then lost in the park. Meanwhile, Hammond, Sattler and the rest of the operations team learn that Nedry has locked up the computer system to cover his tracks. They attempt to get power back in the park in order to escape the island. After shutting down the system, then restoring it, they then realize they just shut the power off to the velociraptors paddock and now they are also on the loose, & are now on the hunt for the visitors.\n\nThis movie won 3 oscars which is amazing, one of them for Best Effects, Visual Effects,  which you have to give credit to Dennis Muren, Phil Tippett, Michael Lantieri, and Stan Winston.  The CGI in this movie was amazing,  The dinosaurs looked real.  You can not tell that they are computer generated, I almost felt that I was at a real park with real animals.  Well Done.\n\nThis movie gets an A+!  I have always enjoyed movies that director Steven Spielburg has put together and he doesn't fail to deliver on this one.  The actors really make you feel like the dinosaurs are there and the story has a nice mix of action and humor with even a bit of suspense.  This is one of my top ten favorite movies and if you haven't seen it yet go get it and watch it.",

Your hairs will stand on your skin, your eyes widened, jaw agape, teeth grit and legs tapping at the building atmosphere. If you thought Jaws was suspenseful, imagine it tens times more so, now in 3D, remastered for further viewing pleasure. We all know the story; a team of researchers is trapped on a Dinosaur ridden island after communications are knocked out. This unforgettable classic blockbuster hasn't aged a bit.\r\n\r\nSteven Spielberg's sweeping style and ability to pass awe onto the viewer remains unbeatable, within the first five minutes you are fixated on the cage that is being hauled into storage, as workers risk their lives shipping the precious yet dangerous cargo inside. What I love most is the facial expressions the actors pull throughout. Richard Attenborough gleams with happiness and proudness, leaving Laura Dern and Sam Neill looking onwards with bewilderment as if they're about to have a breakdown. Things really get going when the Dinosaurs break loose, watching the camera close up to the actors as they turn around in horror looking upon the might of these monsters gets you pumped. The acting is utterly convincing and I love the cast, it would be great if they were to reunite for Jurassic World, but I'm cool with Chris Pratt, Ty Simpkins and Bryce Dallas Howard taking the leads.\r\n\r\nSome things don't age over time. Sigourney Weaver remains as attractive as ever since her Alien days, and is as talented as ever, and the same can be said for the special effects in this masterpiece. It's fantastic, sometimes you expect to laugh at how bad some films have aged, I laugh at the original Total Recall as sad as it is to say it's not aged well at all with the dated visuals and animatronics, yet Jurassic Park looks astounding and sounds powerful, hearing that Tyrannosaurus roar over and over again is staggering and harrowing, not to mention epic! And in 3D this thrilling adventure looks wonderful, you can peer into the screen as the depth has enhanced the island and its inhabitants. \r\n\r\nIf you can get your hands on a 3D release do it, simply put worth every penny and to see this classic given an update is pleasing. Let's see what is given a 3D update next: Maybe Twister/Aliens/Speed, who knows, but for now Jurassic Park is even more powerful than ever.",

            "content": "\"PREHISTORIC THEME PARK\"\n\n- 'Jurassic Park' is a 1993 adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg (Jaws, E. T.) and based on the novel by Michael Crichton. This movie forms the first installment of the popular dinosaur film franchise with the same name. It's my favorite movie, due because it was the first one I saw in the theatres and it has everything a movie needs. What kid doesn't like dinosaurs?  I really love the story, although a lot of drastic changes have been made in comparison to the novel, and the effects and sounds are absolutely amazing. Undeniable, this is the film I have seen the most, and even now I still spot little details that feel like I never saw before. 'Jurassic Park' is the greatest film ever made and won three Academy Awards. It was an absolute blockbuster and had a whole merchandise around it. I also would like to praise John Williams the fantastic soundtrack, and of course the cast of 'Jurassic Park': starring Sam Neil (Dead Calm, The Tudors), Laura Dern (October Sky, I Am Sam), sir Richard Attenborough (The Great Escape, Miracle on 34th Street), Jeff Goldblum (The Fly, Independence Day), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Star Wars prequels), Ariana Richards (Tremors, Battledogs) , Joseph Mazzello (The River Wild, The Hollow), Wayne Knight (Space Jam, Rat Race), Bob Peck  (Edge of Darkness, Lord of the Flies) and Martin Ferraro (Oscar, Stop or My Mom Will Shoot). \"Welcome to Jurassic Park.\"\n\nPaleontologist Alan Grant (Neil) and his girlfriend paleobotanist Ellen Sattler (Dern) are invited by the eccentric millionaire John Hammond (Attenborough) to visit his theme park on an island near Costa Rica and give their honest opinion. In the helicopter they meet lawyer Donald Gennaro (Ferraro), who represents the park's investors, and his guest mathematician Ian Malcolm (Goldblum). Shortly after their arrival, the group is stunned to see a living Brachiosaurus. Hammond's scientists have succeeded in cloning extinct dinosaurs, that are now ready to be shown in 'Jurassic Park'. \n\nThe group is joined by Hammond's grandchildren Lex (Richards) and Tim (Mazzello) for a tour in the park. While the guests take place in the automatically controlled vehicles, John goes to the control room to follow the ride. Unfortunately, several of the dinosaurs fail to appear. When the cars are near the triceratops area, the group steps out and stumble upon the park's veterinary who is treating an ill triceratops. Ellie offers him to help examine the creature and stays behind, as the others continue the tour. When a storm is approaching the island, most of the employers are going home for the weekend, only chief engineer Ray Arnold (Jackson), the park's game warden Robert Muldoon (Peck) and computer programmer Dennis Nedry (Knight) are staying.  When Nedry, who has been hired by the corporal rival to steal embryos, deactivates the security system, all hell is about to break lose. The cars with the guests have stopped in front of the Tyrannosaurus Rex paddock. With no electrical fences to stop her, the prehistoric animal attacks...",

Every character has their story cut out for them as soon as the film begins, which includes but is not limited to: the \"greedy corporate sellout\", the \"young girl with not-so-hidden talents\", the \"reluctant but good-hearted protagonist\", the \"wise-cracking mathematician who has no reason to exist\" and well...pretty much everyone else.

Dr. grant is very fun with his knowledge of the raptors and I even like Jeff Goldblum was really good because he actually did bring in that reality side to the film leading to my favorite character John Hammond, because Hammond in my opinion is Walt Disney. Why? like Walt Disney; Hammond did not want to open for the wealthy but to everyone and like mickey is to Walt dinosaurs are to Hammond meaning that his entire life has been around and seeing his grand kids grow up has inspired his dream to see these magnificent  creatures in real life sharing it with everyone.\n                                                                                                                           Finally the effects even to this day Jurassic park has one of the best special effects both visually, and sounds. the dinosaurs look real, feel real and sound real hell when I first sawed that T-rex climbed out of its pin I cried in terror because it looked so real and intensely well pasted. its because of that reason that I hate 1998 Godzilla for ripping this off as cliche as you can get (first you kill Godzilla one of my favorite characters then you rip this off do people just love killing our childhoods).\n                       that my friend is Jurassic not just a bad-ass flick with effects that break boudaries but a film that strikes the heart. its watching a childhood dream come true, and is John Hammond is my favorite character his making child's dream into a reality but like all dreams reality brings in nature making the film good for adults as well for children because this what all us kids think about a fantasy into a reality and dinosaurs are a big part of that I should know I've grown up with them their like family.

Because Jaws couldn't show the shark for most of the first half of the movie, the film is forced to focus on building its three main characters, Brody, Hooper and Quint. Also because the earlier film focuses so clearly on only three vivid characters, they are much better defined than anyone on the much larger cast of Jurassic Park.  There is not a lot of depth to the characters. Most of them are more caricatures than characters.\n\nMy sole complaint was that some of the characterization gets lost in the second hour. I still feel that way a little bit, yet two decades have helped me see that it really doesn't matter. Jurassic Park is full throttle entertainment, plain and simple\n\n \n\nNow, as much as I recognize this film's faults, that doesn't mean I don't enjoy it.

Most of the film takes place on the island, with Spielberg wonderfully building suspense slowly and than when the big stuff happens it never disappoints. The dinosaurs don't really remind of you big special effects, but more as real dinosaurs who wonderfully add to the film and are the best part. Whenever watching the film, you are amazed by the sense of detail and authenticity that is brought to each dinosaur. The cast is also perfect, primarily Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, while Richard Attenborough gives a terrific supporting performance as the millionaire. The action is terrific, John Williams's score is memorable and the film never disappoints. Once again, Spielberg has delivered another winner. Well done.",

However when I watched this film I noticed something that almost destroys this film: the characters/actors.\n\nI think every character is one dimensional. While the mad scientist and douchebag hipster are fun, there is no feeling of development or reality.\n\nThat is why the Dinosaurs are so important. Not only is this CGI still nice to look at while not overwhelming the audience (like how films today need 20 explosions and brown filtering) but the horror and drama that the dinosaurs bring is scary. Yes the two main characters and kids are going to be ok: cause no director would DARE be that audacious- but the other characters have random fates and so it's interesting how they get whacked. The best part of some scenes is that the Dinosaurs may take a few minutes before attacking, dragging out the drama to make memorable scenes. I wish they had more hostile dinos because outside of the Trex and raptors there wasn't much else.\n\nOverall this film is still good to watch, but only for the Dinos. Most of the humans are completely forgettable, and since they make up most of the film anyways it is this film's biggest weakness.",

This movie is mostly know for it's visually effects and they are magnificent, these are some of the best effects I've seen in cinema, even to this day it's amazing how we'll they held up for all these years, but it's not just that the characters are very likable, you get wrapped in there problems and you want to see them( the good ones at least) succeed top that off with top notch story telling and you got a classic\n\nOverall: while there are some minor flaws in the movie, they are easily overpowered by the films we'll told story, great characters, mixture of terror and wonder, not to mention the size of the movie which is huge( the movie is gigantic in a good way) and some AMAZING!!!

The music is great too. It's awe inspiring and it makes your hair stand on end. The characters in this movie feel suitably real as well. They all act like real people. Nobody felt like a fake movie character, which was rather nice. This movie also has possibly my favorite child performances of all time. Both of the kids are fantastic.

This movie does so much right, it's so close to being excellent. My only issue really comes from the ending. How Hammond really give up on his dream so easily? I realize things went south, but there was really no scene displaying his displeasure with failure. There was merely a scene similar to that of a persistent child and his mother where Hammond talks to Dr. Sattler about what he's going to do to fix the park once things settle down. Sattler immediately shuts him down and tells him to let the park go and he pretty much leaves it alone.\n\n*-Bad\n**-Okay\n***Good\n****-Really good\n*****-Excellent",

We all know how the T-Rex steps out from behind the fence, yet later that spot is a drop-off, it must be a sink hole, but did you ever notice how when the T-Rex smashes through the SUV roof, the plexiglass breaks in half, but of course, in the close-up, it is a magically restored, whole piece and perfect shield, protecting the kids? Now I did still enjoy the movie and carefully took in all the 3D atmosphere, but some of the conversion was NOT translated properly. Mainly regarding the people. The shoulder that faced away from the camera did NOT seem the proportionate distance away, causing the actors to appear strangely hunched over, like something looks wrong, but one cannot quite figure out what is.

True story. \nElysium seeks to explore this dichotomy between the haves and have nots in a dystopia some century hence.\nThe film is beautifully rendered (especially in IMAX) with the same grungy feel employed by 33 year old director Neill Blomkamp in his debut sensation District 9. On earth that is. \nIn  Elysium, a paradise disc spinning tantalising above earth, everything is clean, green and bright. So everyone wants to get there, but only the richest can.\nBlomkamp explores the same theme (segregation) as he does in his first movie and makes excellent use again of Sharlto Copley as a rivetingly psychotic South African rogue agent.  \nThe pacing is brisk, the action breathless and nonstop, the plot engaging and the scenery and tech never less than involving. \nHOWEVER.\nThe film is too sweary. The F-bomb is dropped more times than actual bombs, and that is saying something. The violence is a bit much, too. \nDamon is too worthy. In 30 Rock and his comic rivalry with Jimmy Kimmel, Matt has proved himself to be a cheeky funny guy. He has some witty altercations with droids, sticking it to the man at the price of a broken arm, but as his radiation sickness ramps up and his exosuit clamps on, the wit dries up. He ends up being a little flat and much less impressive than in, say, The Talented Mr Ripley or Bourne,\nJodie Foster is absolutely rubbish. This is, as others have said, a career low. She spends the whole film trying and failing to master an English accent, which evidently wasn't enough as it had to be overdubbed. Her ice-queen villain shtick would have been much better executed by Sigourney Weaver or Glenn Close or Meryl Streep or Tilda Swinton. She knocks off half a star single-handedly. \nThe script is too heavy-handed after a chirpy start. The characters aren't quite developed enough and take second place to the action, which is always a mistake, especially in a movie which evidently has designs to be more than just a shoot-em-up. The main love interest plus sick kid could have been moving but is just a bit meh. The soundtrack sounded too much like Prometheus or the Dark Knight with all the blaring low horns. The implausibilities were a little hard to stomach in places. \nAll in all, however, it is a watchable, engaging film that raises some critical questions about how we in the film-watching West are going to actually *do* something to make a fairer future for everybody, not just we lucky few.",

With a couple of jeeps driving a handful of people around? Who'd let him have that zoo? In 24 hours the USA would invade, apprehend the entire scientific staff and move the dinosaurs to Guantanamo base. And then you have the incredible safety measures: the dinosaurs are kept at bay by an electric fence. One kind of obvious problem: what if the power goes down? And then you have these goofy characters doing goofy things. I can forgive any amount of goofiness if the characters are lovable; I LOVE Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.

I absolutely love the story to this movie. It is based off the book by Michael Crichton, but I have never read the book. Dinosaurs being reborn by Frog DNA and Dinosaur blood in Mosquitos covered in sap is one of the coolest ideas for a story ever. All of the characters are well developed and very enjoyable. Sam Neil, Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern, and Richard Attenborough are fantastic in the movie. The Dinosaur effects are amazing. When you see parts of a dinosaur, it is animatronic. When you see a full dinosaur, it is CGI. Spielberg was careful not to use too much CGI though. It also takes a lot of time to see the dinosaurs. If this movie was made today, they would show the dinosaurs right away. I recently saw this movie on the big screen in post conversion 3D. The 3D is absolutely fantastic for this film and it has the best post converted 3D I have ever seen (I have not seen Titanic in 3D). Overall, this is a masterpiece of film. It has great characters, a great story, outstanding special effects, and great pacing. Jurassic Park is one of my favorite movies of all time.",

With no disrespect the director, actors, and everyone who worked on the films the best thing about this film for me is the scoring.  John Williams does what he does best a thrilling and hair standing flair to the scope of brilliance.\n\nThe special effects are handled with the utmost care and stand the test of time even with CGI technology at it's infancy for the time.  The attacks are frightening without being needlessly gory.  The action is on-the-edge-of-your-seat stuff.  The philosophical questions and issues raised are intriguing.  The way in which the dino's are brought to life is taken with care to make it believable.  The first time we see the dinosaurs are breathtaking.\n\nThis film has great pacing.  It teases the prehistoric animals through much of the first third so it builds anticipation for the viewer instead of chucking lots of dino's in left right and centre.\n\nNow admittedly there are some things I didn't like.  Brattyness or stupidity of kids are always irritating in films.  Much to my delight it never drove me to the point of wanting the dino's to eat any of the children.  Just about.  The way of which Dino's are brought back to life but then breed, and wreck havoc is a good spin on things but I didn't buy how the scientists nor park warden's didn't figure that out.  Still, I brush those things under the carpet of movie magic.  Still thoroughly enjoyable and worthy of better sequels than it had.  Works better as a stand alone film.",

I'd seen animation blended with live action before, but always in a more cartoony way (like Mary Poppins.) Now we had computers inserting dinosaurs that looked so genuine they blended right into the action. The story was exciting, and kept the audience on the edge of their seats. The acting was solid, and the annoying kids were tolerable because they provided some laughs. I was even willing to overlook all the glaring goofs that the movie-makers failed to edit out. This movie was one of the first that made me see a future (which we now live in) where anything a director can imagine is possible to manufacture in a computer. But time has passed. As I mentioned we live in the future now. So modern minds decide it is time to give this classic new life by transforming it into a 3-D experience.\n\nThe 3-D transformation was really surprising. It amazed me how much effort they clearly put into this adaptation, because it almost felt like the movie was originally filmed with 3-D cameras. They achieved depth so masterfully, that it didn't seem out of place or tacked on. However, there is one problem, and that is the fact that Spielberg never filmed this movie intending for it to expand into 3 dimensions. You can tell this because there were an over-abundance of close-ups where people were talking, and the 3-D effect is useless in moments like this. No one wants to see Richard Attenborough's nose hairs in eye-popping 3-D. Likewise, the dinosaurs rarely attack the screen, so you don't get that moment which makes the audience jump because it appears the jaws are coming right at them. So, while the 3-D is integrated so seamlessly, it still feels tacked on. I appreciate the experience of seeing Jurassic Park in a new format, but it didn't seem necessary.\n\nSeeing the film in IMAX was my biggest mistake. This was beyond what even the most skilled computer tech could make work for a movie that was filmed in a standard aspect ratio. I did appreciate the size of things that were supposed to be enormous on screen. For instance, when the jeeps enter the park and we're shown the gates as they pass overhead, I found myself actually looking up at them as if I was going through them. The problem is most shots are not intended to look so massive, so we frequently noticed awkward stretching. The legs of characters looked strangely long and spindly. The greatest downfall of combining both 3-D and this extreme size was that it brought the CGI into so much detail. Suddenly I wasn't amazed like I was 20 years ago, instead I found myself thinking \"this could be so much better if it was made today.\" You see, where 20 years ago I often failed to see where CGI stopped and live-action started, now it was being thrust in my face to make it clear what was real. In the end, the story was still intact and that's a winner, but perhaps they should have just left well enough alone and avoided changing a landmark film like this one.",

Joining them is mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and Hammond's two grandchildren, played by Joseph Mazzelo and Ariana Richards. When a smuggling employee (Wayne Knight) shuts down the system and steals some dinosaur embryos, the dinos go mad and Jurassic Park turns from a park of wonder to a park of total nightmare.\r\n\r\nBefore I make any criticisms about this film, I must say that the visual effects for the dinosaurs are some of the best CGI effects I've ever seen. After 20 years, the dinos still look extremely menacing, and I applaud Spielberg and his crew for a magnificent job at creating such magnificent creatures.\r\n\r\nAs for the terror shown in the film, Spielberg uses the fear he spreads in Jaws and carries it on in this film. Many of the frightening sequences in this film are not only thrilling, but also fun and entertaining, such as the first encounter with the T-Rex.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, I enjoyed the cast in this film. Sam Neill and Laura Dern had a fine chemistry, and Attenborough was enjoyable. Samuel L. Jackson stole the show as Jurassic Park employee Arnold, who says the best line in the film, \"Hold on to your butts.\" But Jeff Goldblum really stole the show in this film. His lines are clever and had the most entertaining character in the film.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, Jurassic Park lacks a strong character development. The film never explained why someone would want to re-create dinosaurs, and the romance between Neill and Dern was never developed. Wayne Knight's character is never fully put to use, cause it is not explained why he would want to smuggle the cloned dino medicine.\r\n\r\nMy biggest problem are the two kids. They are extremely annoying. Not only are they stupid, but the situations they get into don't make any sense. For instance, the boy gets electrocuted while climbing down a 10,000 volt electric fence, and he still survived. How does that happen? If I had it my way, then I would have the T-Rex eat the kids, then Jurassic Park would have been a much better film. But my belief is that Spielberg is a family man and he didn't want to disturb the little ones. Oh well, but at least they're not as annoying as Jar Jar Binks.\r\n\r\nDespite my small problems for this film, I view Jurassic Park as a revolutionary landmark in film and a Spielberg classic. While not his best film, it's still a fun ride.",

It's just hard to compete with newer movies of our day for a great rating. I'm sure back in the 90's the special effects on this film were amazing. Now, not so much.

Of course, at the time the real star here was the film's fantastic effects work - it was CGI's coming out party, after all - and that aspect has aged surprisingly well over the past two decades. Sure, if we look closely a few seams might show here or there, but the raptors remain unsettlingly vivid and our first glimpses of a grazing brachiosaurus remain nothing short of stunning.

The characters I thought were pretty well done and acted, you really didn't want certain things happen to certain people and I really like Sam Neil as Alan Grant. Now, I was really exited to watch my favorite film on the big screen and especially in 3D, I watched it in IMAX as well, something I had never done before, and boy did it deliver. The 3D in this movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, better than Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 by far. Jurassic Park in the third dimension brought a whole new life too it, just some of the scenes with the trees, and leaves and then an awesome scene in the kitchen was good in 3D.

            "content": "How many 3D rereleases have we seen in the last year?  As far as live-action goes, we have the disparaged (if misunderstood) 'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace' and the criminally overrated (and tragically featuring an audio nightmare by a terrible Canadian) 'Titanic'.  Now comes a re-release of 'Jurassic Park' - the movie that not only revolutionized movie making, but also gave cinema goers a sense of old-school awe in a way that director Steven Spielberg had come to be known for.  Not only is this 3D re-release a well-done effort from the company that post-converted 'The Avengers', but it's also just a joy to see this film on the big screen - especially in IMAX 3D.  \nWhen a wealthy entrepreneur named John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) seeks out the advice of some renowned paleontologists, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), the doctors get more than they bargained for.  Turns out, Hammond has created an island paradise filled with cloned dinosaurs and yearns for the doctors' approval of the park.  Together with a mathematician, Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), and Hammond's grandchildren (Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards), the doctors set out on a tour of the park.  But, after an initial sense of wonder sets in after an encounter with a triceratops, Murphy's Law begins to take effect.  Soon the dinosaurs are loose, and the visitors on the run.  Can mankind's dream of seeing these prehistoric creatures still come to fruition, or will nature be too much for man to handle?\nSay what you will about the plot and the scientific intricacies of the film, but the tyrannosaur escape alone is worth the price of admission.  In IMAX 3D, it is so real.  In two dimensions, it was terrifying and captivating enough, but add the extra dimension and incredible sound on a massive screen, and you're in for a thrilling, nostalgic movie-going experience.  The brilliant use of the then-new computer effects meshed perfectly with Stan Winston's incredible practical effect creatures is still mind-numbing and jaw-dropping today as it was two decades ago.  And if that weren't enough, the raptors in the kitchen are just as terrifying today for adults who saw the movie as kids and had the stealthy reptiles haunt their dreams.  (Oh, and if some kids saw the clip in IMAX 3D when their parents took them to see 'Oz the Great and Powerful', it'll likely scare them into insomnia as well.)  The film didn't have to have a fool-proof plot or one devoid of plot holes.  The film was the first of its kind with ground-breaking effects that made the extinct come to life and was shared with the world.  \nOkay, so the film has some holes in the plot.  First, there's the perpetuated theory propped up by paleontologists in the film, but that's a topic for an article that's not a movie review.  There are other plot holes and fuzzy math and science to boot that were much better explained in the novel by Michael Crichton (who also wrote the screenplay).  However, with the sense of wonder, those issues are easily looked over.  Also, the other aspects of the film are nearly flawless.  The actors bring their characters to life with pizazz.  Neill and Dern make for a believable pair, and Goldblum is characteristically comical.  With side characters played by Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Knight, the casting was pretty dead-on.  But no one exemplifies the solid casting decisions of the filmmakers than that of Attenborough.  The man becomes Hammond, and is the anchor of the film (even though very few wealthy entrepreneurs could likely read a blueprint). Also, the camera work by Dean Cudney was one of the best aspects of the film outside the creatures.  Add John Williams' wonderful score to the mix, and the film is complete.\nThere are few auteurs that could have made this film, and Spielberg was the right choice to usher in this era of computer generated effects.  This movie was a perfect showcase for the technology.  Twenty years ago it was astounding.  Seeing it again in the twenty-first century is as enjoyable as it was back then.  In fact, this film has stood the test of time so well, that even modern films struggle to achieve a level of craftsmanship that this film set the bar for.  Cinema junkies will love to see this film for the nostalgia factor, but regular folks can enjoy the film as well for the masterpiece of filmmaking that it is.  It's not advisable to turn adolescents loose to see this film, unless you enjoy striking fear into the hearts of children.  But for those old enough to understand the difference between fact and fiction, this will be a wonder to see in its 3D glory.  It's not perfect, but it's a thrilling time at the movies - again.",

            "content": "If I had to rank my top 10-20 favorite movies of all time, \"Jurassic Park\" would have to be on that list(probably around 10).  It has everything.  Action, adventure, great acting, a great plot, and 20 years later is holds up amazingly well.  If you don't know the story, then run to the theater and see this now, because you will be missing out by not seeing this at least once on the big screen.  I saw a teaser in IMAX when I saw the new \"Oz\" movie, and immediately knew I wanted to see this again.  I wanted to see it at IMAX, but due to where I was the day we were gonna go, I could only see it in 3D.  The 3D is done well, but it doesn't really add anything to enhance the movie, unless you see it in IMAX.  The teaser I saw was the T-Rex scene, and let me tell you that was something special.  You felt like you were right there in the car with the kids and wanted to hold your ears shut too at how loud the T-Rex roars.  The effects on this movie are still awe inspiring and better than most movies made today.  Time has been very kind to \"Jurassic Park\".  I've heard that 2014 will bring part 4, and after rewatching this, it can't come soon enough",

We watched it multiple times and practically memorized the flick, so IMAX and 3D allows the viewer to see, hear and scrutinize every detail in the film even more, to be brought in and be even more amazed and a part of the Jurassic Park world. Small details and little quips of audio & dialogue that you may have forgot are brought forth in surround sound & 3D. I highly recommend seeing it with the family.

Here, on the big screen and the best example of 3D post conversion yet, Spielberg spells out his formula for H'Wood success for the umpteenth time: Scares. Smarts. SFX. This CGI pioneer truly looks more authentic than most of the Dino droppings being released today.\n\nFor those born after the Clinton administration, this 20th anniversary 3D conversion of the PG-13-rated adventure centers around a multimillionaire (Sir Richard Attenborough) who unveils a new theme park featuring dinosaurs cloned using advanced DNA technology, only visitors end up fighting for their survival. \n\nTrue, the movie displays some telltale Spielbergian tics (close-ups of characters in awe, monsters playing peekaboo, a swooning John Williams score). Of course, this is one of the movies that made them iconic. Neil, Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Attenborough shine, but the true stars are the so-real-it's-frightening dinosaurs.\n\nBottom line: Monster Smash.",
