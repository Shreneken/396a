It has great pacing for being two hours, a touching story, and it doesn't even screw up time travel! It has the most simple time rules and it doesn't try to do too much with them, very enjoyable and easy to follow. What is especially great about this movie, is its not so subtle, yet subtle lessons and messages about life. Such as sacrificing your own happiness for others, taking chances, cherishing every moment you're given and living life to it's fullest. Now I'm certain there are more lessons to be learned in there but these are what really stick out. This is a well done,  excellent film, with a lot of heart and meaning behind it.",

While the time travel aspect could make it a bit Sci Fi, it is certainly not a Sci Fi focused film.  It is a RomCom with a Sci Fi twist.  The plot was unique enough to keep you focused, the casting great, and pacing for the most part even. In fact, the only thing keeping it (imo) from a top score was that fact that I felt they stretched the film a bit and dropping one of the subplots would probably have made it a bit more enjoyable overall.

It's incredible that they made such an interesting movie despite mostly mediocre acting and a far fetched plot gimmick. \n\nBut the movie worked. It didn't take itself too seriously, and wasn't completely goofy either.

Perhaps I wasn't paying full attention but it didn't really engross me enough to feel invested in it, hence my low-ish rate. I think some people will enjoy this but it won't appeal to all.

            "content": "About Time is a romantic comedy that abides themes such as living in the present. It is a beautiful movie that tells us so much about life and living every day to the fullest. This movie is not only about a love story, but more about the challenges of life and how important it is to show love to our family and the people around us at every given opportunity, without waiting before it's too late. It tells a lot about the son and father relationship, and it takes us to stir emotions with the most meaningful ping pong game, giving a sense of how little moments in life can mean a lot. About Time makes us reflect on life and how we are using our time, makes us question how we are showing love towards the ones we love, how we are making others' day better, etc. It shows how important is the way we approach our day, even simplest as it can be. Tim's father gives him the \"big secret\" on using this gift that they have. Still, Tim goes a little farther in learning about this, saying how he just tried to live every day as he would travel back to this one day, just to enjoy it, not needing to use his extraordinary gift at all.\n  About Time is a well-filmed movie that shows the reality of life. It has a story lesson and wants the audience to ponder about life. The casting is good, and although the authors did a good job, my favorite actor in this movie was Bill Nighy, who played the father. The film has a good intention, but I feel it lacks many things and could have improvements. First, the script uses some inappropriate language, which I would not recommend for a younger audience. Second, the movie repeatedly repeats many scenes because of the time-traveling, making the film seem long. Even if the director Richard Curtis wanted the film to have more of day-to-day life, it has a lot of unnecessary scenes, making the movie a little dull. Despite this criticism, this movie has a lot of sweet and funny scenes and has a story to learn from it. However, I would say it's not the best movie out there. I do recommend this movie, but do not expect something fantastic out of it. I would give it 3/5 stars.",

The message of the film teaches it's audience that what we think will make us happy stops us from stopping and smelling the roses of our already charmed life. Life is never easy but it is beautiful if one could learn to see the beauty in it. \nThe love story in this film is a beautiful love story. It's not a traditional Hollywood love story because it lacks all of the overused tropes like love triangles, ultimatums, forbidden love, infidelity, passionate love affairs, or anything like that. It's just two people who are perfectly suited for one another, falling in love, and falling more in love and gaining more respect for each other as the years goes on. This is the love story we should all want in our real lives and it's beautiful to see it on film. \nI never wanted the story to end and to say goodbye to these characters. \nThis will be my favourite movie for years to come as it has been since its release.",

It tries to cover the darker stages in life as well, and how the character with his time travelling powers still have to go through them, but as negative as reality sometimes gets for most, it never becomes. \n\nAnd this is fine in my opinion. A movie doesn't have to fully cover reality. Apart from the time of movie About Time is, it's also an attempt to think about what possibilities there are if one had this specific type of time travelling power. \n\nThe movie tells a simple but original story, well thought through, fun and told in a beautiful way. It looks and feels different somehow, maybe because of the British setting. The interesting take in my opinion is that apart from the ability to travel through time, they attempt to keep everything else realistic.\n\nThe atmosphere keeps mostly the same. There are some quite funny moments, but About Time is not a movie that's intended to make it's audience roll out of their chairs laughing.\n\nThere are some insights on life shared, that as a viewer I felt one should take to heart, but it never gets overly idealistic or even preachy. They even put it in perspective themselves since the main character makes an alternative choice, which I found pretty interesting.\n\nI felt for the characters involved, who come over als believable. As a viewer, you don't get drawn in with them though. The only criticism I can think of is a little lack of character development. But I'm not sure if I needed this for the story the movie makers are trying to tell.\n\nYes, scifi-nerds will find problems in the way time traveling is implemented since the story ignores a lot of related problems. But it's a feel good movie, which doesn't need to get every philosophical point correct.",

On his 21st birthday, Tim (Gleeson) learns that he can travel back to anyday he can remember just because he can. So what does Tim choose to do with this extraordinary gift? Play the same days over to allow him to win over Mary (McAdams) by telling her what she wants to hear. That's essentially the entire movie and spoilers!\n\nThe story alludes to Tim, as a lawyer, uses this to win all his cases - and occasionally help others... but OMG can writer/director, Curtis really not find anything more creative for Tim to do? 20 years earlier, Ramis gave us a hundred different things that someone can do if they knew they could relive the same day over. Curtis could only think of three.... showing a true lack of creativity or imagination.\n\nIf you like predictable, Hallmark-ish, sappy romantic comedies -- than you just may like About Time.

No film is unique, and for sure there are similarities with other Richard Curtis films, but that is all. Plus to be compared to other great films is surely an honour.

I thought...?\" about Tim's various jumps and they often broke the rules set forth in the film - which for some reason his father doesn't tell him about immediately?

Then halfway through the film things become very serious, and the film becomes a different sort of film. The two parts don't seem to go together at all. I also hate the premise that the men are the only ones in this family that can time travel. ",

It was difficult to me to get bored because of the different genres that you have. Every time something different happens on the movie that makes you want to know what happens next. \nAlso in my opinion the principal actors made a great job, like Domhnall Gleeson that wasn't a very recognized actor and Rachel McAdams made the perfect couple and made this film special.  The director made an awesome job too because it is difficult to organize something with this theme of going to the past and coming back to the present, without getting you confused.\nPersonally I learned a lot of things with \u2018About Time', like for example everything that happens in our life is for a reason and when we make mistakes we learn about them so they are essential to make us progress. \nThat are the reasons you should watch this magnified and lovely movie. \n",

Domhall Gleeson plays an awkward 21-yr old law apprentice in London, when he learns from his father (Bill Nighy) that all of the men in his family have an extraordinary talent: time travel.  There are of course limits:  you can only travel within your lifetime, and only into the past, and if you travel earlier than when your offspring is conceived, your offspring from the future of that point will be a different person.  That last point is critical, because Tim (Gleeson) recognizes that once his 3rd child is conceived, he can never travel back to revisit his father, who is now deceased, without changing his child.  It's little details like that which make time-travel movies so much fun.  But Richard Curtis violates his own rules after he creates them, which causes a lot of confusion.  Clearly, if you can enjoy the characters on-screen without realizing the inconsistencies in the narration, you'll enjoy the film.  Nighy steals every scene he's in, he is so much fun to watch.  Rachel McAdams is Gleeson's eventual wife (after several meet-cute redo's) and McAdams is given virtually no character development to work with.  She's on-screen to smile and be reactionary to Gleeson's awkwardness.  She doesn't even attempt a British accent, even though everyone else in the cast is British-born.  This shortcoming is explained as being an American character in an essentially British film.  Worth the watch if you enjoy the actors; just don't try to think too hard about it.",

The concept of time travel in a romance seems at a glance as if it would diminish the intimacy and humor of such a beautiful genre of movies.

            "content": "At the age of 21, Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) discovers he can travel in time... The night after another unsatisfactory New Year party, Tim's father (Bill Nighy) tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. Tim can't change history, but he can change what happens and has happened in his own life-so he decides to make his world a better place...by getting a girlfriend. Sadly, that turns out not to be as easy as you might think. Moving from the Cornwall coast to London to train as a lawyer, Tim finally meets the beautiful but insecure Mary (Rachel McAdams). They fall in love, then an unfortunate time-travel incident means he's never met her at all. So they meet for the first time again-and again-but finally, after a lot of cunning time-traveling, he wins her heart. Tim then uses his power to create the perfect romantic proposal, to save his wedding from the worst best-man speeches, to save his best friend from professional disaster and to get his pregnant wife to the hospital in time for the birth of their daughter, despite a nasty traffic jam outside Abbey Road. But as his unusual life progresses, Tim finds out that his unique gift can't save him from the sorrows and ups and downs that affect all families, everywhere. There are great limits to what time travel can achieve, and it can be dangerous too...\n\n\"About Time\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Beautifully filmed and unabashedly sincere, About Time finds director Richard Curtis at his most sentimental.\" Catherine Shoard of The Guardian compared the film to Groundhog Day noting it \"is about as close to home as a homage can get without calling in the copyright team\" and describes Domhnall Gleeson as a \"ginger Hugh Grant\", which \"at first, is unnerving; as About Time marches on, Gleeson's innate charm gleams through and this weird disconnection becomes quite compelling.\" Shoard gave the film 2 stars out of 5. Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph praised the comic timing of McAdams and Gleeson, but criticised the film, comparing it to a quilt, calling it \"soft, frayed at the edges, and oh so comfortable\" and gives it a score of 3 stars out of 5. Leslie Felperin of Variety magazine called the film \"reassuringly bland\" and says there is sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu especially for anyone who has seen The Time Traveler's Wife also co-starring McAdams. Unlike that film she has no knowledge of his powers, resulting in a \"fundamental lack of honesty in their relationship\". Felperin noted British reverse snobbery would put many off this and other Curtis films, but that this would be less of a problem among American Anglophiles and those willing to suspend disbelief, taking the characters as British \"versions of Woody Allen's Manhattanites (but with less angst)\". Felperin praised the chemistry of the leading couple \"that keeps the film aloft\" and the supporting cast, while also criticising the stock characters as being too familiar. The film became a surprise hit in South Korea, where it was watched by more than 3 million people, one of the highest numbers among the foreign romantic comedy movies released in Korea.\n\nThis is yet another sugary film from Richard Curtis with some ok thoughts on life and how we live it. However, I really disliked the first hour as the story was quite ridiculous with the time travel set up and Domhnall Gleeson is stuck in one expression more or less all the time and his relation and meeting with Rachel McAdams (lovely however) character is just too much in my book at least. The premise of the story is just seriously wishy washy, pretentiously romcomy and way too jumpy in the storyline. It\u00b4s actually only in the end of the film when Nighy\u00b4s character has passed away things become emotionally moving. And by then it\u00b4s too late to get emotionally engaged in the film. I think the cast is solid in general, Bill Nighy is always good and that needs to be mentioned. But, the characters leave a lot to wish for. \"About Time\" is simply too much Richard Curtis, meaning it\u00b4s too much, too long and too over the top with a bloody marzipan rose as the crown on a gigantic cake that makes you nauseous.",

I know this movie isn't perfect so it shouldn't really be a 5 star movie but it's one of my favorites and I just love everything about it so to me it is a 5 star movie. This movie is a perfect combination of a romantic drama with a little bit of a science fiction twist and the mixture is amazing together in this film. The plot is so brilliant and has some funny moments and some very sad tear jerking moments. It engaged me throughout the whole journey and I felt the connections that the characters in the movie felt it was a magical experience. The actors/actresses did a fantastic job as well Domhnall Gleeson gives a performance I loved and really connected with him and felt like you were in his shoes making certain life changing decisions, but the real star of the movie is Rachel McAdams she was amazing in this movie and in my opinion probably her best performance of her career. She was a great choice as the little insecure girl at the beginning falling in love with Tim.  Some more were Bill Nighy who provided some comedy relief in certain parts of the movie, also Lydia Wilson played Kit Kat very well for an actor I'm not very familiar with. The themes in this movie are also very important and work well with the movie structure. So About Time is an emotional journey of plenty ups and downs that really makes the audience connect with the story and the characters. The plot is outstandingly written, the actors did a fantastic job and the tone shifts are on point and really captures the right emotion for every single scene. In my eyes this is a perfect movie.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, it s about time we reviewed About Time.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) And there s no time like the present! Let s recap.\n\nSCOTT: We meet our hero, an Englishman named Tim (Domhnall Gleeson), who appears to be an ordinary, awkward 21-year-old until one day his father (Bill Nighy) tells him the big family secret: All the men in the family have the ability to go back in time. Tim decides to use this power to acquire the one thing that has always eluded him, namely, a girlfriend. He meets a wonderful American girl named Mary (Rachel McAdams), and after several time-travel trips (needed to erase his mistakes) he is able to win her heart.\n\nGREG: Scott, this is a nice, warm love story in the same category as  Notting Hill  or  Love, Actually  (all by the same writer / director Richard Curtis). Tim meets Mary at a dinner party and successfully gets her number.  But then he decides to travel back in time to fix a play by his father s playwright-friend Harry. When he does, he alters the events that lead up to meeting Mary. He then has to wait for Mary at a Kate Moss exhibit and when he does, he learns that she has a new boyfriend. So, he goes back in time and intercepts Mary before she meets the opposition. He then tries and tries again, working on his approach until he perfects it. She falls for him a second time.\n\nSCOTT: I agree that About Time is the sweetest, most endearing love story of the year. It reminds me of a 2006 Sandra Bullock film called The Lake House in that it is a romantic tale that incorporates elements of time travel. About Time is a stronger movie than The Lake House largely due to the remarkable performance of Domhnall Gleeson, who plays the role of a sweet, humble, love-starved man to perfection. We have a terrific ensemble performance here, with individually great actors forming a whole that exceeds its parts. Bill Nighy strikes just the right notes as the loveable, playful dad. Tim s sister Lydia (Lydia Wilson) is wacky, dysfunctional, but equally loveable. We even want to give the demented uncle (Richard Cordery) a big bear hug. And of course Rachel McAdams steals our hearts with her warm portrayal of a woman who is one of the few souls worthy of Tim s big heart. This movie exudes charm from start to finish.\n\nGREG: I thought About Time reminded me of Groundhog Day - one of your favorite movies, Scott. In it Bill Murray trips through time repeating the day over and over again trying to win the heart of the beautiful Andie McDowell. About Time is a wonderful hero s journey. Tim starts out as an ordinary young man who wants to win the heart of a young lady. He s given a special power from his mentor-dad. He then spends the summer trying to make it with a pretty girl, only to learn that even with time travel you cannot force someone to love you. Then he gets a new goal - to win the love of Mary. Things are going pretty well as he builds a relationship with his new love when something happens that turns his life upside down. He must then regroup and come up with a plan for making things right. He learns a life lesson that we can all take home. It s a complete mythological story in a modern setting.\n\nSCOTT: If I had to pick some nits, the rules of the time-travel superpower seem like rather arbitrary plot devices meant to manipulate our emotions. Also, About Time offers a confused message about how to live one s life. As we ve mentioned, there are scenes where Tim keeps repeating a day until he is able to produce just the right events to make a relationship with his future wife possible. The lesson appears to be that we should make strong efforts to impose our will on a situation rather than allow the events in our lives to unfold naturally. Yet there s another scene that suggests the opposite lesson. In this scene, natural circumstances lead Tim to encounter a woman named Charlotte whom he is trying to avoid. Even his time travel powers cannot prevent this encounter, although he tries using them anyway. It s clear that Tim s character needs to be tested by this encounter, and he passes the test, allowing him to transform as a character. This scene suggests that we should accept things that are either meant to happen or meant not to happen.\n\nGREG: I think that time travel is a superpower that everyone wants because we all feel regret. How often have you gone home after a party and wished you had said something slightly more clever to your boss - or some other person you wanted to impress? Time travel gives our hero (and therefore ourselves) the ability to go back and try it again (and again) until we get it right. And our hero Tim is a true virtuous hero as he doesn t try to gain fame or fortune for himself. He just wants to win the heart of a pretty girl. And remember, the writer establishes early in the film that try as you might, even time travel cannot make someone love you. They have to have it in them to begin with. And so Tim is really just getting what is rightfully his.\n\nSCOTT: I thoroughly enjoyed About Time from start to finish. The movie offers up a truly moving love story, not just between a man and a woman, but between a man and his father as well. There aren t many movies that leave me near tears at the end, but About Time left me with a lump in my throat the size of Tim s enormous heart. This film is the best love story in the movies in the past five years. I happily give About Time 4 Reels out of 5. As you ve noted, Greg, we have a wonderful hero transformation here, as Tim learns that you don t have to repeat a day to improve upon it -- you can simply allow it to unfold with all its flawed beauty permanently etched in time and with no need to change a thing. There is great mentoring, a stirring love, more than one great test of the hero s character, and a gift to be given to future generations of Tim s family. For this reason I award Tim 5 Heroes out of 5. Movie: Heroes:\n\nGREG: I agree with you Scott. Like other movies by the same writer, About Time is a touching love story with a message we can all take home. I had the luck to see it twice and it got better the second time around. I give About Time 4 out of 5 Reels and 5 out of 5 Heroes for Tim. Movie: Heroes:",

When we see such places we can go others tell us what places it is possible when it's time travel. When such places we see passed down from family member to family member we see what such places means when it's a family time kept secret. When such places we go we see we can undo time to go in the past to do it differently. \n\nWhen we see what time we have to do all what we wanted to do we see such places that can take us there when it's time for others to pass down what they have ample of time doing to see it's now time to give it to others. When we see that what we know what such places are all about others don't know, but we do when we learn from our mistakes to go back in time to the same places.* When such places we wish to go we see the possibilities in going such places when time is on our side to redo, but such places that others wish us to go eventually lead us to no place in time. When we embark in new places we see time away can enrich us in different places and sadden those in other places when growing up is hard in such places for everyone to face.\n\nWhen such places we reach we don't see what time will bring of those at the door when others could use a time machine to redo some moments they lost in their own place & time seconds ago they wish return. When we see a place can hold just about and place and moments in time we wish to go back in time for but see we are the only lucky ones. When we see such places we share in common we see what time will bring together when we see something's and don't see other things to see what places hold when they are unpredictable. When what places we see that seeing doesn't matter we see we have plenty of time to try anything new in such places to meet those new. When what places we reach when other places don't matter are deeper places that we rely on when time to get to know one another makes us reach those places faster. When what places those automatically go are back to places that makes them hopelessly not fall in love when putting time on other places and not into deeper places we see what matters to most for others, when they see us just fine. \n\nWhen such places others attend to we see things can go all wrong to put us out of place when time can only tell what others can't do and redo that changes such places until those get it right. When what places we see time apart takes us we miss out on other olaces to see those again. When what place we make for those to be in high places we see what place we need to go when we see we have another chance that time travel isn't needed when we have all the time in the world to wait for those who might be in such places. When what place others take are places with those they are unsure about when time can only tell what such places will bring when it's early. When what places time has more for is history when some places holds those in time when they don't age a day older over time to place them in any place & time when they are super.

When we see what place others hold are risk takers when what others see as wierd others see differently to make place.\n\nWhen what place we try to make it in time before others to redo such moments in time in what gets us in other places with those we intended to be placed with. When what place others make for others are those who see eye to eye with us that we invest more time with. When what place we spend more time with are places where we share more of eachother to see whether we want more time & other places. When we see what more time can bring us when it's into those places of places that we can go back in time again and again until we get it right.\n\nWhen what place we are knocked right off from are places of wollow when we see what places of love bring when time brings us the perfect man & woman. When what places we have been to when we are going places with those when time makes us do wierd things. When places we reach that others reach we see how little time we have to make those places seem natural. When we see what place we want to make for those to only put others in their place to stay away when we need more time and places with those we love. \n\nWhen what places we go with others we see familiar places that we know time will not allow to stay away. When what unexpected places we see time does allow are second chance places that we see we have time to get to know more of such places we drifted from in what others don't know to know what time will bring. When such places others bring us to we need to get back to other places when time brings us to the realization of who we want to be with in every place and time. When we see that all the time in the world to go any place isn't what we want when there is no place and no time we rather be then with those by our side. \n\nWhen such places we reach, are places we once what time brings in such places to announce moments. When other places others reach are places that doesn't turn out to what others see during their time in such places to return to other places.* When what places we reach over time are places where we are happy to be with those we love to see more of in what we see eye to eye with. \n\nWhen what places we reach we make it official when it's time to get married in what we wish to see for the rest of our life. When not everything we wish to see go as planned when bad timing can take such places by storm. When we need to make such places perfect to put those in the right place when time brings those to places that takes others places to know who is well suited. When what others places ahead of everything in such places we see what time we can't take back are our harsh words. \n\nWhen what places others arrive to are places in what time will bring us when we don't see where we are going as others do. When such places we reach we reach on time when others reach darker places they don't see they are fit to go places. When what place others place themselves are places they see are natural. When what places we show those when it's too late to not be too late we see the place where it all began when not seeing right in the place and time we can fix.*\n\nWhen what new places we arrive we see what place and time we see clearly what is in front of our eyes all along. When what places we can't change are places that already permanently happen that we see time can't change when its birth of our first born. When what other places we can't change are others places when a new time and place we can't go beyond when we see no other way. When what we see and others see are what they can change when time still can take us places with others. When what places we reach when we see we have covered all what time we need to go back in time for we see that we don't need it as much when we are in a happier place with those. \n\nWhen what places we see time wouldn't change when it's our mind in what we want to see that we can't change once it's done. When we see that there are moments we can change and other moments we can't change when time doesn't see such places we don't know exists. When there are moments that forever we can't change to only go in such places in time that wouldn't change anything but means the world to those who have little time on this world to hold as long they can when ample of time brings them to the happiest place and time  in their life, us. \n\nWhen what place we are in now we see that moments we do miss out are places where we see and cherish all that is not perfect to see what we can do within that time that time travel is not needed to make a difference in what life brings us plenty of time to do, be humanly imperfect. \n\nWhen what place others hold for us we take those places to heart when we might not see right but feel right in such places that time can't take away. When we see what new places we might have others take within time, to see others places permanently gone when it's time to say goodbye. When we can choose to have all places that are dear to us when time gives us a chance to spend it with everyone within times grasps or go new places with those in what they want when we see eye to eye with them. When we don't see moments in time that are not worth spending as much time with those as we can we see what places it takes us when time is on our side that we know when time is up and we have to say goodbye that every place is special when it all goes away. When we see time heals all that new places fills other missing places and we embark on the new time we have with those who go places, using time wisely and seeing one another before time is up and we end up in those other places. \n\nWhen what extra time and places we give to those we see that they use it wisely to not make the same mistakes as we did when time is precious.\n\n******************************************\nWhen we see ourselves inadequate among ordinary, extraordinary family and friends we begin to see how lucky we really are.

            "content": "\"About Time\" stars Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, a socially awkward young adult who finds out he can travel in time (inside his own timeline) and decides to use his powers to find love. The target of his pursuits is the also somewhat awkward Mary (Rachel McAdams). There are definitely some questions regarding the specific mechanics of time travel, however, it is not a big issue, since this is a romantic comedy with elements of time travel and not a sci-fi film about time travel. The key plot element seems to be the sort of self-induced \"Groundhog Day\" with Tim's repeated attempts to make Mary fall in love with him. Surprisingly, time travel does not actually happen that often. In the second half of the film it is only used two or three times.\n\nThis is a romantic comedy, meaning it has to tick two very important boxes: romance and comedy. There is definitely chemistry between the leads. Tim and Mary are very similar: they are both a bit socially awkward, shy, but also very witty. The dialogue between them highlights their similarities and feels very real. Romance: check. The dialogue is overall fantastic, laced with British dry wit. Contributing greatly to the comedy are the supporting characters surrounding Tim and Mary, like Tim's quirky free-spirited sister or his bitter playwright landlord. The scenes between Tim and his father (Bill Nighy) are some of the best in the film. Every character is unique and quirky almost to a fault. Comedy: check.\n\nHowever, the movie fails in plot and plot structure, which is rather unfortunate, considering the interesting concept. A tried and true format for films is to have a tense conflict that the protagonist tries to solve throughout the film despite the many obstacles thrown in his way. This keeps the audience invested in every scene. This film does not do that, but rather it is an episodic series of minor conflicts. The pattern is: a scene or two introducing the conflict, then a scene resolving the conflict, and then a scene or two of Tim and Mary just being in love. And repeat. The conflicts rarely revolve around their relationship. Be it good or not, but here we do not have the formulaic romantic comedy structure and on paper this format actually makes sense in keeping with the themes of the film - living life and appreciating its ups and downs. But this does not translate onto the screen very well. The lack of central tension results in boredom. Also, it means there isn't much of depth to the character of Tim. Therefore, when the movie ends, it just sort of happens.\n\nSpeaking of the ending, the similarities between this film and Richard Curtis' previous success \"Love Actually\" (2003) are very noticeable. Firstly, the ending of \"About Time\" is stylistically identical to the opening of \"Love Actually\", complete with a disembodied voice talking about life and love over shots of random residences of London. The plot's misgivings can also be traced back to the 2003 film. \"Love Actually\" is an ensemble comedy with each character having their own conflict and resolution. The lack of one central conflict works in that film, because there is also no central protagonist. \"About Time\", on the other hand, is a single protagonist film with a multi-protagonist structure.\n\nOverall, the film is enjoyable despite its shortcomings. There are plenty of embarrassing and hilarious situations that Tim finds himself in. As for those looking for romance - Tim and Mary's relationship is exactly what you want. But with a better structure to the plot and better use of the under-utilized time travel aspect, the film could have been so much more.",

            "content": "WHAT I LIKED: As a general rule, I think Richard Curtis is hugely under-appreciated as a film-maker, and nowhere is that more the case than where his 'About Time' is concerned. Now of course his overall reception is largely down to genre-prejudice, but for me this film is the best example of how he always balances everything so well, and in doing so creates a genuinely excellent movie that still largely gets critically forgotten.\nFor a start, About Time strikes the perfect balance between taking itself seriously, and having a bit of fun, and that exists both in the story itself, as well as in the tone of the film where different types of humour are used at all the right times to relieve from all the emotion. It is a silly plot after all, but it's yet again one that you can take a bit seriously because its characterisation and relationships are so well-built by Curtis and his amazing cast. The investment you have is nurtured too, as there's just the right levels of both soppy happy endings and difficult twists and turns to keep you there without swallowing you up or spitting you out. It's also paced rather elequently (which agreeably is something that can't be said for all of Curtis' ventures) and has some lovely themes that are yet again treated with the right level of exploritative seriousness and light-hearted whit too. Basically, About Time works because it's a proper balance between excellent 'rom' and brilliant 'com,' but putting those words together sadly puts some off before they even try it.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Maybe the silly (and often over-convenient) plot lose some sense of the relateable realities of love, life, and death, but if you take it as not-so-seriously as the movie does, you wont really mind at all.\nVERDICT: It's About Time people gave Richard Curtis a big pat on the back. He delivers his most balanced film here, and I really love it.",

One of my dearest friends recommended it, so I watched it one day, and by next day I had to rewatch it because I loved it so much!\n\n So, a brief synopsis (no spoilers! promise): The story is about Tim, a regular guy without luck in the love department. On his 21st birthday he finds out that all the men in his family have the ability to travel in time. But as Uncle Ben taught us: \"with a great power comes a great responsibility\", so he must use this for something good and can make his life better. Can you guess on what he's going to use it? YES! You guessed right! On getting a girlfriend. So this is only the beginning but soon Tim will find out about the complications of time travel and problems of everyday life.\n\n Now that you have the premise and have seen the scores and stuff, let me tell you what I think.\nFar from being pure science fiction or just another corny movie, it meets in between with a good balance of reality and fantasy. It makes us hope that we can live the way Tim does. It's the kind of movie you can enjoy every single time you watch it, not because it's the best movie ever! But because it explores our humanity through the humanity of the characters. Rather than make them strong or undefeatable, Curtis achieves what every filmmaker must: to show the vulnerability of a human being, with well rounded characters and not stereotyped. \n\n You see, About Time speaks to you about some things that we already know, stuff in the back of our minds, but it manages to bring it all together and remind us of the importance of enjoying life, and living it to the fullest. My dad would say that is a men's movie (like he said about The Secret Life of Walter Mitty) but I disagree (on both). Because it is not about just a man, it's more of the daily challenges and the big decisions that we have to make where we can all relate to that, not only men or only women, but every human being in touch with their emotions. An for me that's what makes it a great movie. \n\n To tell you the truth I have absolutely no idea how many times I've seen it! I just lost count of them after the first two. I almost made a party when Netflix uploaded it a few months ago! So that's me, I watch movies so many times I learn the dialogues (you can expect that of a child I know, but not at 25 years old)  \n\nFrom my blog: filmpressionist.blogspot.com",

About Time, the latest from romantic comedy writer/director Richard Curtis, is one of those films. It's a delightful little experience that just oozes sentimentality and warmth, even when it delves into more serious subjects. The heart and soul of this film ultimately stems from the lead performance, that of Domhnall Gleeson. Gleeson nails every facet of this character that the story requires: his naive charm is irresistable, his aimlessness is relatable, and his comedic timing is on point. The comparisons between Gleeson and Hugh Grant are completely on-point. Alongside him, Rachel McAdams' own natural sense of charm is a perfect match for Gleeson, and the two work impeccably work together. Also worth mentioning is Bill Nighy, who is utterly perfect as the father figure to Gleeson's Tim. The sort of sci-fi aspect it brings to the table, the Tim's ability to travel back in time as he chooses, is more of an extension of the themes on hand than a gimmick, which is a refreshing change of pace that never detracts from the main romance. If there's anything to nitpick, its the blatant breaking of the time travel rules (established very early on in the film) in the break-into-three portion of the film, but its a plot hole that's so easily forgiven because of the pure joy this film is sure to instill.",

After I watched this movie,\nI become think about \"Time\" deeply. I really recommend this movie so I will introduce this story plot. This movie's leading actor can Time travel, but he can go only past time. So he often back to time to redo something.\nWhen he met a so nice girl, he couldn't do cool to her. So he back to past time and he redoing again and again. Because of this, he could get girl friend and also he got merry! I like this part of movie after merry.\nI think this movie's actor and actress is fantastic. This movie's heroine is Mary was played by Rachel McAdams. Her acting impressed me. Espacially when Mary was angry to baby, she was so impatiented, because Mary's baby made mess. So Mary was so angry. Rachel McAdams played this scene. It was so emotional. Her expression was great.\nAnd Domhnall Gleeson's acting also so nice. Domhnall Gleeson played Tim.\nI think his acting is mistrials and realistic. His crying scene was awesome. I was impressed.                                                                                                                                                            \n    This movie was made in British. So you can see beautiful scenery.\nIf you intrested in British, It's good movie. You can see British scenery.\nI recommend the party scene. The party scene is romantic.  You can see so nice British restaurant and town. After watch this movie I become want to go British. \n   Music surface, this movie's music is awesome. For example, \"Push the button\" is sung by Sugababes. This music is used in New york party scene.\nI like this song. I recommend it. Other is \"How long will I love you\" song by jon Boden and Sam Sweeney and Ben Coleman. This music also awesome. I often listen this music when I feel sad.\n   At the end, the movie of Last part is sprising. I cried a lot. I was impressed by the last part of words. Tim rearised importance of Time.\nI also noticed that how importance time is. After watch this movie I consider about daily life. I want to live every day in a meaningful way so that i will not regret it afterwards.",

            "content": "Entertaining low-key time travel/romance\n\nA recent book (Twee: The Gentle Revolution in Music, Books, Television, Fashion, and Film by Mark Strand) has announced the arrival of The Age of Twee. Twee, if I understand it, is a generational cultural movement like punk, but is more or less the opposite of punk, and to some extent a reaction against it. Where punk was cynical, gritty, defiant, aggressive, and disorderly, twee is sentimental, gentle, retiring, friendly, and innocent. If punk is a cold slice of leftover pepperoni pizza, twee is a fresh baked ginger cupcake with vanilla frosting.\n\nAbout Time seems an exemplar of The New Twee consciousness. This film set in contemporary Britain (Cornwall and London)is the story of Tim, the son of an eccentric family whose men have always had the ability to travel back through time, as his father (Bill Nighy) informs him on his 21st birthday. Understandably skeptical at first, Tim finds he actually can time travel, a talent he devotes mostly to trying, rather awkwardly, to manage his relationships with women, finally finding his true love in the form of an attractive though somewhat nerdy American girl, Mary (Rachel McAdams.)\n\nThe story is what might be called a \"soft\" time travel film: the time travel is effected simply by willing it, with no technology involved, and works only going into the past and back to the present starting point, so there are no science-fiction-like visions of the future. The movie emphasizes relationships over physics, and though it's frankly sentimental, and I thought a little long for the material, the script is intelligent and the acting very good.\n\nI think About Time would appeal to those who want to see a film that interestingly combines romantic comedy and time travel fantasy, and who don't mind if it's a little, or more than a little, \"twee.\" It may really be a three star film overall, but I'll add a fourth star for the film's exploration of some of the personal ethical implications of time travel, an issue which seems rarely considered in other time travel films I've seen. Advisory: ridiculously rated R for occasional language and a few explicit but fairly mild sex scenes. The Universal Blu-Ray disc is of very good quality; there is also a standard DVD available.",

I also found the concept of this film thought provoking, however I'd liked to have seen time travel explored in more ways than it was, but then again, I enjoy science fiction more than romantic comedies so I'm probably in the minority. I just wish the focus had been on time travel rather than the relationship of the two characters, which I didn't believe was that engaging.",

            "content": "Sometimes a flawed and somewhat predictable movie can be enjoyed by the watcher due to its charm and inoffensive manner, Richard Curtis's time traveling love story About Time is one of those films, a film that provides enough laughs and heartfelt moments that only Scrooge himself could not find enjoyment in this tale.\n\nBrendan Gleeson's very own Domhnall Gleeson gets his first big leading role here as our lovable ginger time traveling lawyer Tim and he does a fine job at being a lovable red haired version of Hugh Grant. Gleeson's chemistry with season rom-com veteran Rachel McAdams is made believable also with her slightly underused talents coming to the fore in most of their scenes and the eventual on screen romance plays out in a believable manner despite all the time traveling business occurring throughout. While this love story is a major part of About Time, Curtis has also positioned the film to be more than a man meets girl tale with a twist, and with this choice has made a film all the better for it.\n\nPlaying Tim's Dad is veteran British actor Bill Nighy, who with Gleeson gives the film another side that usual rom-coms would be hard pressed to have. It's within this relationship between time traveling father and son that the movie finds many relatable and confronting issues to deal with and by films end the audience's emotional investment has been well and truly earned thanks to it. In concerns to Curtis as a director, it's also a departure for the man who has not shown this side of himself as a director before but that's not to say the film lacks a few well-earned laughs and Curtis usual array of colorful supporting characters, which is evidenced in Tom Hollander's playwright Harry.\n\nComing in at roughly 2 hours About Time covers a lot of ground and in doing so it would be fair to say that the films first half pales in comparison to its much more concise and impactful second half, but as a whole it all comes together in such a way that it's hard to fully criticize. Watched with the right mindset About Time is the perfect movie for a night in and stepping stone for lead Gleeson to find his feet in the world of big budget tent pole movies.\n\n3 and a half clenched fists out of 5 \n\nFor more reviews - \n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

            "content": "Some of the reviews are, IMO, unfair to this movie by dismissing it as a rom-com, but it's way more than that.  Rom-coms end after \"boy gets girl\" and we're to assume that they live happily ever after.  But in About Time, boy gets girl about half way through and we see life go on.  Their interactions as a married couple are gorgeous, and the stuff dealing with having kids is even better.  Its handling of the death of a parent is achingly spectacular, as is its depiction of life going on afterward.  While younger people might be confused that the movie didn't end at the wedding, to me that's where the movie becomes its most powerful.  If you are a grownup with a spouse and kids, who has dealt with the decline and/or death of your parents and this film doesn't move you, there just might be something missing inside you.\n\nBill NIghy as the dad is phenomenal, and Rachel McAdams - in a movie where she's only the third hottest woman - steals the show.  Domhnall Gleeson is really only playing the quirky Hugh Grant part, but he does it convincingly.  The music is unbelievably well done and the cinematography and scenery are beautiful.\n\nThis movie does exactly what it set out to do, which was NOT to tell a convincing time travel story.  It's about becoming an adult and savoring your life, and it may be the perfect example of that theme.",

The means by which the time-travel happens is just silly, that's got to be said up front. There's no Back To The Future style attempt to explain the science and you get the feeling no-one has thought it through at all, and you also get the feeling that if you were to try to think it through now, on no possible level would it make sense.

Director Richard Curtis is well-known for his romantic comedies such as \"Notting Hill\" and the Bridget Jones movies, but this script digs a lot deeper than most.  Curtis tapped into the creative complexity that he used to write \"Love Actually\" and the result is this clever, heartwarming, and frustrating story about a man learning the personal consequences of changing the past.  The film was criticized for its plot holes, but this film can't be approached like \"Primer\" and other sci-fi nerd  films (I mean that in a good way) that use science to prove the possibility of time travel.  The story is about living, not travelling through time.  It does have its cutesy moments, but I would still recommend this to the manliest people that I know.  Concepts like living each day twice to enjoy the little moments and using time travel to extend your time on earth are fascinating, while the characters live out a complex love story.  All of the acting is great, particularly Bill Nighy and Domhnall Gleeson.  I watched \"About Time\" to make my wife happy  but, in the end, I was the one who fell in love with this story.",

Half of it works, it's funny, it's even quite sweet. Half of it is utterly useless, overly sentimental, and a waste of time. I am beginning to really hate the tendency to burst into tears and sing a film's praises when watching some made up people live made up lives and do things we wish we could do. That's not what film is to me; it is more than just insipid wishful thinking, it has to be creative, clever, entertaining at least! This just lost steam and piled on the easy tearjerker moments until one of the most nauseating final monologues I have heard in years. Domhnall Gleeson, you're great, and I know you needed the money and the screen time, but please, pick less BS films from now on. You'll earn a lot more respect.",

            "content": "I wasn't really sure about this movie because it's labeled as a romantic comedy, so naturally I was skeptical. But it turns out it's not really a romantic comedy at all, it's a drama with a weird sci-fi plot element. The movie is about a guy who discovers that the ability to travel back in time runs in his family, and how he experiments with this ability with sometimes positive, sometimes negative results. So yeah, it's totally silly, so make sure to leave your rational brain at the door. And wait a second... didn't Rachel McAdams already play a time-travelers wife??? She clearly has a type! Anyway, the movie does have romantic themes, but that's only one of many as it is a surprisingly complex film. It starts with a rom-commy feel to it, but it soon changes and you discover that the real relationship that this film explores is that between the father and son. It's also quite emotional and really tugs your heartstrings, which I did not expect. Domhnall Gleeson is great as the lead, he carries the story entirely on his own and sells both the character and all the relationships in the movie. I do think that the movie is not as cohesive as it could have been (the tone drastically changes about mid-way through) and it's about 20 minutes too long and starts to drag in the second half. You'd think a movie called \"About Time\" would be more cautious about its pacing and total runtime. Even so, it's worth watching, the story is original and executed well and the performances are solid... even Rachel McAdams' stupid face was only mildly annoying. Though the premise is obviously ridiculous and (like all time-travel movies) riddled with plot-holes, the movie has so much heart that the logistical flaws in the story don't matter at all. And the overall message is poignant and one we all need to be reminded of every now and again.",

It does a lot of things right - there is a very unique and riveting screenplay here with some outstanding scenes, the actors and actresses seem very invested in their characters, and the movie is rarely ever boring. However, I cannot say this is a great movie because I wish it were more focused. There are two quintessential relationships going on in this film - the relationship between Tim and Mary, and the relationship between Tim and his father. The movie takes most of its time to focus on Tim and Mary - as it should; their budding relationship is an extremely important part of the entire movie and Tim's life. Yet in the end, it is Tim's father that we must say goodbye to, someone who - in my opinion - is not in the spotlight enough in the movie. I enjoyed watching Tim spend his final moments with his father, yet I felt that the ending could have been so much more. I also felt that the comedy side of the movie fell incredibly short - besides a couple of remarkably funny scenes, I very rarely laughed. It didn't take away from the movie, but when it's referred to as a comedy, I expect a little more effort. But regardless of my complaints, About Time is still worth a shot. It's reassuring to see that Domhnall Gleeson is able to carry himself well in a lead role, as I'm sure he'll be a big name actor when Star Wars, Episode VII is released.",

The film is marketed as a romance film, and for the first half, that certainly is the case, but the latter half changes its focus towards more serious and mature, which parallels with Tim's growth in life.

He didn't let the character be defined by one or two key attributes but rather he projects a naturalistic structure, which helped with the accessibility. Rachel McAdams as the film's romantic interest was charming and cute but couldn't match Gleeson's performance, as also he is given a much larger focus and screen time in the film.

Maybe I'm our faller. \n\nThe first time I saw the trailer for this film, I knew I would like it, but often times the trailer surpasses the actual film. Fortunately, this was not one of those films. Initially, this just seemed like the usual rom-com with a bit of the time traveling twist but it turns out to be much, much more. I have definitely fallen in-love with Richard Curtis' style of directing. \"Love Actually\" is and has remained one of my most favorite films of all time and I think this film is my 2nd \"Love Actually\"; I have never fallen in-love with a film so fast and so hard. I am completely sold. First, the was definitely a heart-tugging-tear-jerker-laugh-out-loud roller coaster ride. Every single person in this film was brilliant-- not a boring character in the lot. I initially wanted to see this because of Bill Nighy because he is just so bloody brilliant-- I love him! Domhall Gleeson was awesome, he was just too adorably awkward enough and dory-cute that the role seemed tailor made for him and Rachel McAdams, who is getting typecast in these roles, had beautiful on-screen chemistry with Gleeson that it would be difficult to imagine anyone else in the role. She was just too charming. It always a pleasant surprise to watch favorite familiar faces pop up in films: Tom Hollander whom I adore from the Kiera Knightley \"Pride & Prejudice\" film and from \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" and Margot Robbie (who played Laura Cameron from the t.v. series \"Pan Am\"). Also, I award extra brownie points whenever a film has actors who've appeared in Harry Potter: Domhnall Gleeson (as Bill Weasley), Bill Nighy (as Minister Rufus Scrimgeour) and of course, Richard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon). \nThe brilliant thing about \"Love Actually is how well all the intertwining subplots weave together to make one coherent film, this film did that beautifully as well-- not a single insignificant plot in the entire film-- it was absolute perfection!!! I cannot gush enough about this film, my heart still aches at how poignant this film is and how wonderfully touching the message was. It's just absolutely, positively one of the best films I've seen in a long while. I absolutely love(d) it.",

It's honest, it's emotional, and it aims to show the pleasant irreverence of life in all aspects. It's especially tender when dealing with drug abuse, relationship problems, and death's presence. Still, it stays whimsical throughout, a feat that other fluffy romantic films can only dream about attaining.",

The characters are all believable, especially Gleeson, McAdams, Nighy, all of which deliver stunning performances that are the more believable for their understatment of emotions, a welcome change to the exagerrated fare offered by Hollywood, which - just like adding artificial flavours to strawberries - lets us forget the true taste of life. Yes, the time travel bits are a tad weird, dont really fit the whole tone of the movie and I dare say they dont adhere to most of the common \"rules\" (arbitrary as the may be) of time travel.

Kit Kat (the sister) is so goddamn adorable. Hughes, I thought, was solid as lead male. McAdams is always at least average, and Nighy was quite effective as the dad. Another great character is the uncle. He doesn't say much but sure as heck delivers a great line late in the movie.\n\nCouple things without trying to spoil: There is one time change and I thought maybe the end of the movie was nearing. It would have been a very big sacrifice and I think it would have been powerful. And the win-win...he's got Margot friggin Robbie inviting him in.

I feared this because of its 'Groundhog Day' plot device that would have allowed About Time to easily over-do it in the dreamily amorous sigh/swoon department as it is the story of a young man who discovers he has the ability to travel in time to change small events in his life for either better or worse.  The romantic angle of the film was heavily played-up/hyped in the trailers as the young man, Tim (Domhnall Gleeson - True Grit), decides to use his ability to get himself a girlfriend and a nearly perfect relationship with Mary (Rachel McAdams - The Notebook).  While romance is a major portion of the movie (and its primary selling point), the film's story between father (Bill Nighy - Love, Actually) and son is just as important -- and the one I actually found to be more touching.  About Time is a relationship drama with a rather flimsy sci-fi twist (as most of the time travel \"rules\" seem to be made up as the film progresses).  I can definitely see why About Time was touted as a \"date film\" but had the father-son story been used in the advertising some more I would think there would have been less aversion to it for some.  As one who doesn't mind romance -- the director's first film, Love Actually, is an excellent film that is almost ALL romance -- this one did strike me as too much so in the beginning; but it really wasn't at all.  Curtis has weighted it well and it comes across as something rather wise ... and one I am glad I ended up watching.",

About the story, when I just see \"time traveling\", good, that's another sci-fi. Then it proves me totally wrong. It's more of family and love thing. The happiness formula about appreciating every moment you have right now when the dad got cancer, and how the guy uses time traveling to visit  the passed away dad is just so touching at the moment. Bill Nighy is just great as always!",

In terms of directing, this is a wonderful swan song for Richard Curtis' directing career.\n\nHowever, the story lacked strong conflict. The love story in this movie did not have any conflict at all. It seemed like it's too much of a perfect romantic story, which felt unrealistic.\n\nAnd the plot holes in this story is very noticeable. To get my point, I had to list down the time traveling rules, applied in the movie.\n\n1-)Only male members of the family can travel in time.: This rule was broken when Tim traveled way back in time from the beginning of the movie with his sister, Kit Kat. The question why Kit Kat was allowed to time travel as long as she is with her brother is not answered.\n2-)Only travel to the past is possible: This rule was broken when Tim arrives in the past and then goes back to the present time. The question why Tim cannot go to the future, but can go back to the present is not answered.\n3-)It is impossible to go back in time before you were born: The first rule that wasn't broken.\n4-)Traveling back to a time before your child is born will cause a different child to be born and the original child will be lost: And the last rule that wasn't broken either.\n\nWith these plot holes and the story lacking conflict makes the movie a bit boring to watch.\n\nThe humor, however, saved the movie. It was funny and smartly written.\n\nWhile this time traveling romantic-comedy movie is not memorable, its humor, charm and beautiful setting will remain you to watch the movie until the credits roll.",

The movie gives you no sense of time passing. The whole experience was dreary. The next problem was the humour, or lack there of. This film was simply not funny. One of the worst scenes was when the heroine was trying on different dresses that she would were to some event I don't care about. The scene went too long, wasn't funny, and contributed nothing. I was offended that this was placed under the comedy section of the video store I rented it from. Apparently they closed down the shlock section. The next problem was the broken concept the movie tried to pass as time travel. It seemed as though a toddler wrote the script and decided to make up the rules as he went along (not to insult toddlers). The next problem I noticed at about the half hour mark. The movie was too long. 45 minutes into the movie I attempted to concuss myself with the DVD case in a failed attempt to make the movie more enjoyable. All further attempts were fruitless. The next problem is that the characters had no development. Apparently the writer thought that making a character dress a certain way was all the development that was required. Another glaring issue was the cinematography. It was poor, but at least it wasn't terrible. The movie's (and I use this term lightly)  \"message\"  is so terribly contrived that it felt impure and horrid. The movie was ornately terrible and is all part of Richard Curtis' grand scheme of riding the contrived sentimental moment cash cow to the bank. What garbage!

I came in expecting another generic \"guy chases girl\" romantic comedy-drama with a twist of time traveling mixed in. Instead, this evolved into a film exploring the importance of family, choices, and happiness in one's life. Domhnall Gleeson was an unconventional but surprisingly relatable male lead who really did an excellent job in conveying his character's maturation and struggles, and his chemistry onscreen with Rachel McAdams seemed very genuine and not overly done. The scenes with Bill Nighy (who plays the father) and Gleeson were some of the most powerful and insightful scenes in the entire movie. I really believe this is one of Bill Curtis's best work and one of the best movies of 2013, and I actually enjoyed the third act of this movie more than \"Her\". While the movies overarching themes weren't as original or creative as \"Her\", the execution and focus of every scene in the last third of the film was almost perfect. The only downfall of this movie was its more awkward, generic plot development and ill-defined characters in the opening third of the movie, but this drawback really takes a backseat to how great the rest of the movie is. About Time may well be the two most purely pleasurable hours I've spent in the cinema all year",

Although while it is a romantic comedy, it's one with a bit of sci-fi thrown into the mix, but it's one of a few films which manages to do sci-fi without using any CGI, and that makes this a bit of a rare beast. Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) has just turned 21, and he's been told by his dad (Bill Nighy) that the men in his family have the ability to travel through time. Something Tim can't believe, until he tries it and he discovers what he can do. He moves from the family home in Cornwall to London. When he meets American Mary (Rachel McAdams), Tim believes he's found the love of his life, and he's not going to let her go, but life gets in the way, but he's able to use his time travelling abilities to put it right, but it doesn't always go to plan, and he ends up altering the course of his life, something Tim has to end up fixing again and again. It's a very British sort of time travel film, but it's a very personal film for Curtis, a romantic at heart, and a man with an impeccable taste in music as well. Gleeson puts in a brilliant performance, while McAdams has become a natural at doing time travel films after The Time Traveler's Wife (2009) and Midnight in Paris (2011).",

While this may give the movie a magical quality, it comes in conflict with the film's tone, which is grounded in reality, save for the time travel. Even something as simple as saying that the family are descendants of Merlin or something would ease my query.\n\nDespite that one plot hole, About Time is delightful. It is clever, well written, well shot and well acted. I enjoyed its sincerity most of all. The film's themes of family and love are played out to great effect.

And it has Rachel McAdams in it, not to offend her or anything I think she's a good artist, her romantic movie aren't good. The Notebook is boring as hell; I hated The Time Travelers Wife. But what drew me towards seeing this movie, was all of the positive reviews. It has a 69% on Rotten Tomatoes, it may not seem like much but it's fresh. I did not catch this movie in theaters. I waited until it was on Redbox. After seeing it I felt like I should have gone to theater so the people who made this movie got my money. I loved this movie. And I know what you are thinking, I am also shocked that I said that myself. Now let's start with the performances. Everyone is great. I think with a romantic movie, which is character driven, should have well written character and great performances from the cast. I think this movie achieved that. With Rachel McAdams character, Mary, the mixture of the writing and acting make this one of the most likable female leads in a romantic comedy. In Midnight in Paris Rachel McAdams plays this mean, unlikable person. But here it's a total 180. Her character is so likable; this is the type of person that you want to fall in love with. Domhnall Gleeson also does a very good job here. He is also likable and more relate able characters in a romantic movie. I may be sounding, or writing, like a broken record but this movie made all the characters likable, what can I say? Bill Nighy was great as the father. I just had to mention that. The chemistry between Rachel McAdams and Domhnall Gleeson is fantastic. They don't act like they are madly in love with one another. They don't hate each other all the time. Definitely one of the most realistic couples I have seen on screen. The premise is really cool. They get really creative using the whole time travel mechanism. Are there time paradoxes? Of course there are, every time travel movie I have seen so far has them. The movie is a feel good movie. But it works for the tone they are going for. It has some really funny moments. Sometime you get choked up. I had a great time watching this. Richard Curtis did a fantastic job making this movie. I will buy this on Blu-Ray as soon as I can. I am shocked that About Time is one of my favorite movies of 2013.",

If you are able to push the sexual content aside, what you will find is a charming and endearing film about the consequences of decisions and appreciating the time that you do have in life. It's introduced early that the protagonist is able to travel back to specific moments in time to alter his history; critics have complained that this idea could have been greatly expanded upon but considering what the movie gives in terms of story, I think it's a minor quibble. Overall, \"About Time\" is a romantic journey that impresses a wide range of emotions throughout this heartwarming chick-flick.",

However, with the lovely Rachel McAdams (Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows) and the incomparable Bill Nighy (The World's End) on board, I was willing to give this one a second look.  Domhnall Gleeson (Anna Karenina) makes for a somewhat compelling lead, and the story doesn't exactly play out like the previews suggest.  It's a much more family-centered dramedy, instead of the overtly romantic chick-flick that the previews make it out to be.  It's quaint, silly, and totally illogical, but I still kind of liked it.  The performances were pretty good, with Gleeson and Nighy really carrying the film, and leaving the bubbly McAdams, Lindsay Duncan (Alice in Wonderland), Lidya Wilson (Never Let Me Go), and the undervalued Tom Hollander (Hanna) to support them.  It's a lot better than I expected it to be, but it didn't blow me away.",

Bill Nighy demonstrates that he can portray subtle deep emotion )n that stiff-upper lip way and  Domhnall Gleeson's foppish lead is miles apart from his Dublin  Irish background and portrayal of Bob Geldorf = very believable.  This movie played very strongly in Australia - much better than in the UK - probably because we are very comfortable with the egalitarian reverse aristocracy endemic here, whereas our English forefathers I think would have squirmed with the discomfort of seeing their class system lampooned in this way.  Rachel McAdams is very watchable as every boy's dream of the bespectacled girl next door type - cute and lovable. Lindsay Duncan is warmly snooty as the long-suffering mum and Lydia Wilson plays the hippy-out-of-time flibbertigibbet  that every family has one of.  Well rounded with the resident Alzheimer's uncle nicely underplayed by Richard Cordery.  All together a rich tapestry of real life with a comic-sad difference that appeals at multiple levels.  Satisfying for the soul.",

This is such an film. The story follows Tim (Domhnall Gleeson), a lanky insecure and hopeless romantic who is told by his father (the great Bill Nighy) that he and the men in his family have the ability to travel back in time to events they've already been to. Tim naturally exploits his new talent to make sure he won't botch up his chance to meet the girl of his dreams. And when he does, it takes some time travelling, awkward fumbles and fixing before he's going on a date with Mary (Rachel McAdams). The chemistry between the two leads is great as we follow them from the early days to their wedding and parenthood. The use of time travel though becomes more than a get out of jail for free card as the rules of time travel are made clear, such as you can't travel before the birth of a child. This gets complicated when death and sorrow is also a reality and Tim eventually learns that sometimes you can't change or fix everything and in the end you have to let life take it's course. The dialogue is witty and clever and despite the 2 hour run time never feels dragged on. There are a few scenes, such as the Kate Moss exhibition that feel a bit forced but they are ultimately overshadowed by the whole package. If you're a fan of director's Richard Curtis's work (Love Actually, Four Weddings and a Funeral, etc) then this one is up there with them.",

The thing I greatly appreciated is the point where most movies would end, at the \"happy, rom-com ending,\" is only About Time's halfway point, and it uses the rest of the time to expand its themes and explore deeper down-to-earth, real life stuff further. The relationship between Nighy and Gleeson especially resonates, and that final exchange between them, oh man. Gleeson follows in his father's footsteps, making for another unlikely lead, but does an exceptional job of carrying things with his awkward energy and natural, easygoing charisma. Admittedly, some of the time travel intricacies are a little muddled, but by and large About Time is a successful navigation on the everyday things between life and death, and the love that ties them all together that makes it worthwhile.",

'About Time' has successfully woven observations of the conceptions of mortality and daily emotional ordeals. What emerges is both a testament to the extraordinary potential that we can attain genuine fulfilment -- amid the tedium of our mundane affairs -- through our persistence in making better choices. 'About Time' is a rather compelling reminder that there exists no worthy replacement for a prudent and tenacious mind -- not even the 'astonishing' ability to traverse the space-time continuum unscathed.",

I wasn't as funny as Love Actually, but it definitely had a charm to it.  It had a serious undertone with a nice message. I did feel like it may have jumped around a bit, but for a movie about time-traveling I think it's forgivable.  I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone, especially to watch it with your significant other. ALSO, I dare you to guess the moment in the film that freaked me out.",

The script was well written, the direction was great and the casts made a decent performance in their respective roles. \n\nThe film done a fine job in balancing the comedic and dramatic elements of the story, providing enough laughter and allowing it to flow smoothly without feeling too overly long despite its 2 hours running time.\n\nDespite the time-traveling plot device, the story focuses on the father-son relationship of Tim and his dad and the lovely romantic relationship between Tim and Mary, without being too sappy, too overly lovey-dovey or too sentimental. The message or overall theme of the film about appreciating life as if it was your last was subtle and not too forceful or preachy.The selection of songs for the film was appropriate and not too overly done for the emotional scenes.The on-screen chemistry between Rachel and Domhnall are convincing enough for the audience to watch them going through life together. On the other hand, Domhnall and Bill, as father and son, their connection is felt throughout the film and certainly evoke some poignant memories when watching them together.\n\nIt's one of the best romantic comedies this year had to offer, better than the disappointing 'Time Traveler's Wife'. It's a great date movie that's not to be missed.",

            "content": "Time travel is by far my favorite theme for films, books, TV shows, and basically every form of entertainment. I love to see the different methods that are used for time travel, the way people use the power, and the way changing history alters their reality. When I saw this film advertised as a romantic comedy with a time travel element added in I was sold. What I got was so much more than just a romantic comedy. One of the best things this movie does is get straight to the point. From the preview trailer we already know the setup, and luckily the reveal of Tim's power is about 5 minutes into the film. I always hate when we know the premise of the film, but it takes almost half the film to get there. Fitting the premise of the movie, About Time doesn't waste our time setting up the story, it just jumps right into telling it. So we have young Tim who is part of a family where the men have the ability to travel through time (as long as it is within their own lifetime.) It's an interesting idea because Tim's father tells Tim that using his power to get big things like riches or fame isn't worth it. Instead it's more important to concentrate on making your life happier. The problem is the one thing he truly wants in life is love, and it seems even time travel can't create that for him.\n\nDomhnall Gleeson is an amazingly charming leading man. I was shocked how deeply he made me experience his emotional journey. He is likeable and you want to see him come out on top. Rachel McAdams is a lovely leading lady, and she possesses a kind of girl-next-door quality that makes her a perfect match for Tim. As their relationship matures you can also see her character mature, and I appreciate that depth to the performance. The other important person for the purposes of this film, and probably one of the most interesting acting performances is Tim's Dad, played by Bill Nighy. He adds such a unique twist to the story because he shares Tim's ability, so he fully understands it. There are so many knowing glances they give one another, and it adds a lot of poignancy to later scenes in the film. There are a number of other characters in Tim's life, and I don't want to short change those acting performances, but really they are mostly incidental to the main plotline. The only one that really jumped out at me, because he added a nice comedic touch was Tom Hollander as Tim's roommate. He plays a stereotypical struggling playwright who acts like he hates everything in life but actually he clearly cares about Tim in his own way.\n\nMy complaints about this film are few and far between. My biggest sticking point is that they don't fully explain how the time travel works, aside from a few cardinal rules. The execution of time travel seems a bit illogical at times, and even creates a paradox or two that they never explain. I suppose for the direction they were trying to go with the film it makes sense that they might not want to waste time explaining all the ins-and-outs, but my geeky mind wanted more specifics. I also felt the relationship between Mary and Tim escalated a bit quicker than I would expect, this is not a big deal, it just seemed a tad out of character. By and large About Time is a brilliant film with several lovely morals to the story. When I was done watching I had a broad smile on my face, and instantly started considering if I needed to purchase the film so I could watch it again and again. I imagine Tim and his Dad have actually lived several years longer than they appear because of the time travel, and it has made them quite wise. Tim is forced to learn that even the bad things in life are part of what makes us who we are so you have to be careful what you change. Then there is that final lesson that Tim spells out for us (which I won't spoil for you here) but it made me think, and reevaluate the way I live my own life. Just delightful, a high recommendation from me.",

However after watching the movie I felt that this movie is highly unrated. This movie not only combines the love story you are use to seeing but also adds in a different flavor of science with time travel. I must say I found myself really loving this movie and I feel like there is nothing quite like this movie out there. The plot line wasn't anything different but instead a mixed unique flavor. The standard love story happens with boy meeting girl but the boy as it turns out is able to time travel (only in the past and all me in the family have this ability) which greatly alters not only his love life but his entire outcome. As it turns out certain events can be altered such as a child's birth, if you change things in the past. Needless to say this is a movie that is excellent for a date night and will be enjoy immensely by both parties. I would say that a weekend price ticket is easily justifiable as you will enjoy every bit of this and even find yourself laughing and tearing up at certain parts.",

Plus Bill Nighy was there...it actually seems like they pilfered several of the Harry Potter-the-later-films-cast-members, then tossed in Rachel McAdams; which worked out just fine if you ask me.  So yeah, FABULOUS movie! My mom & I laughed like the disturbed individuals we are (well, it WAS funny!) & my dad actually stayed awake to watch the end....I can't begin to explain what a big deal that is. (Seriously, movies are like Valium to him - I'm pretty sure he fell asleep during Skyfall & The Bourne Legacy, so it's pretty much HUGE). Add a Ben Folds song (and the other songs too) & I was in movie Heaven. I think PG-13 would have been a more appropriate rating, but maybe Kate Moss's \"breasts\"  (sorry, less than an A cup isn't really a breast to me, but I know she's an icon or whatever). Plus, her dangling cigarette along with the use of certain words were most likely what prompted the R rating.",

The result is a film that just disappoints and you are left wanting more out of the film. I didn't like the film, and I was hoping for something considering its concept. Unfortunately, I felt it went nowhere, and instead of breaking new ground in terms of a romantic drama, it ended up being a clich\u00e9d film disguised with a neat idea. About Time may have had a chance of being a good film, unfortunately it's just an overdone predictable affair, that fails to really standout or be worth seeing. Don't expect anything good here; this is a film that will leave you disappointed. About Time is a film that just wastes a unique idea and adds every genre clich\u00e9 to appeal to a wider audience. Instead of reinventing the genre, it lingers on, and navigates all too familiar territory that has been set by previous genre films. About Time is a mess, one that isn't worth seeing, and the cast here are wasted on such a bland, uninspired script that doesn't satisfy. This is a film that unfortunately is boring and has no redeeming qualities. About Time could have been a good picture, but it relies too much on predictability to create its story, that it's just not interesting in the long run. Skip it, and watch something else. This film just fails as drama, and it's a forgettable film that could have been so much more, but doesn't take off due to a not fully fleshed script, poor performances and lazy storytelling.

            "content": "It is the kind of film that asks the viewer to invest a bit of trust in its own off the wall premise with the promise of some genuine human moments along the way. If you are willing to go along for the ride and suspend a bit of cynicism in its time travel premise (Hughes comes from a line of males in his family who all have the ability to time travel), Director Richard Curtis leads you in to some unexpected places. It's a love story and a bit or a rom com, and on a very simple and surface level it is about a young man who discovers he can travel in time and who strives to learn how to time travel from his father who went before him. Curtis uses this idea to explore some of the films more interesting ideas and creative moments. Such as the idea of treating each day as your last, or learning to live with choices that have consequences for good or bad. It is also a film about family, love, values and even innocence. When first told about his unique abilities Tim (Hughes) states that love is the most important virtue that this gift can achieve. It is not long before love represents itself as somewhat more complex and illusive than he originally thought (something that also allows love to maintain its power). It cannot be forced and it cannot be manipulated, even if you endless time to and opportunity to attempt to control it from every angle possible.\n\nThe most creative moments are interspersed, such as watching Hugh say and do the wrong thing only to quickly transport himself back and try again. Sometimes the best and most enjoyable moments lead him to exploit his gift so as to experience it again and again (in one of the more humorous moments of the film). But the film bravely uses its humor and creativity to lead us towards some genuine emotional moments. This includes an instructive piece in which Tim decides to experiment by living the same day over again without changing a thing, forcing himself to slow down and appreciate the smaller moments of our daily routines. Or when he realizes the consequences of changing one thing at the expense of another, specifically when it sacrifices a personal pleasure or desire for the sake of another. This choice really surfaces when he discovers that helping one of the most important people in his life means the life of another. \n\nThe film isn't overly complicated. But its premise leaves plenty of room to reinvent itself as an atypical rom com. The end result is something charming, funny and challenging in its own offbeat way.  Its main stars (McAdams and Hughes) are given just enough material to leave room to experiment with their charisma, and it suits the material just fine.",

As the main character is able to correct his mistakes in life, he manages to find the lady of his life but he is a able to correct every problem in his life. Personally, I think that they could have picked a better leading character because I was unable to relate to the one that the director had chosen. Apart from that, is great writing and there is enough material to keep the storyline interesting. In some ways, it seemed more like a chick flick even though the main character was a boy. Anyway, it's worth a watch but don't expect anything different from Richard Curtis.\n\nRound-Up:\nI'm really becoming a Bill Nighy fan because of his way of acting and the way that he can make any situation funny. Tom Hallander was quite funny and Rachel McAdams was a great choice for her role. She seems to add a sweetness to all of the roles which out shone the leading character who did have much screen charisma, but I think that was a deliberate choice by the director. Anyway, it's true family fun but it's not a classic like Love Actually or Notting Hill.\n\nBudget: N/A\nWorldwide Gross: $86million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there time travel movie about a teenager trying to correct his mistakes throughout his life. 6/10",

They aren't exactly the highest quality films, but they don't need to be. About Time isn't on par with Love Actually, but it is another solid entry into his overly sentimental and wholly entertaining films category. The story is a little on the cheesy side, but told well enough that you get invested in the characters who are played with charm and wit (minus Rachel McAdams, who is just there to look pretty). Bill Nighy is often hilarious and Domhnall Gleeson holds his own admirably. The overall plot structure follows its own rules when it comes to the time traveling mechanics, which is refreshing, but at times annoying too because you keep expecting established rules to take effect (like the butterfly effect) and they don't. Either way, I enjoyed this movie for what it was and am kind of sad that this might be Curtis' last film.",

Thank God Curtis has yet again fallen to his staple diet and recast Bill Nighy, who almost saves the film, as the elder Lake. \n\nThe film is generally, poorly cast and the actors misguided.  Curtis' 'winning formula' is becoming stale, and this film shows how guilty the director has been in the past, of leaning on bigger and more capable stars to carry the load.",

Feeling hopeless, his life is forever changed the morning following a failed New Year's Eve Party.  His father (Bill Nighy) pulls him aside and tells him a huge secret:  the men in their family have the ability to time travel.  After he relocates to London to start a career in law, Tim puts his newly discovered gift to use, hoping to find the love of his life.  It is there that he meets the gorgeous Mary (Rachel McAdams), and Tim learns to master the time travel process to make sure things go perfectly.  However, in time, Tim discovers that making the most of life in the present is the key to happiness.  \n\nThis is the first that I've seen from Domhnall Gleeson, but I thought he was he was great in the role of Tim.  You can certainly see the awkward, lonely traits of his character and the progression that takes place during the film.  Rachel McAdams is so easy on the eyes and you can't help but to be infatuated with her as the love interest of Tim.  The supporting cast also works well, which includes the stunning Margot Robbie amongst many others.  \n\nI was immediately sold on the concept of About Time, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit disappointed with the final result.  The chemistry between the actors is wonderful, but the film's take on the concept of time travel didn't quite meet my expectations.  There is absolutely no explanation to Tim's ability, and the scenes that demonstrate the act of traveling are underwhelming to say the least.  There are also numerous plot holes that don't correspond with the rules of Tim's gift that his father lays out at the beginning of the film.  At times, it also feels like it's getting sloppy and the run-time probably could have been trimmed by a half hour.  In spite of those issues, there is an interesting story being told with a message that did leave me thinking at the end.  As much as I wanted to LOVE this movie, I was still satisfied with its unique and interesting approach.  3 stars.",

So it's the most aggressively upper middle class thing since 'Four Weddings', that's not really the point. The point is this: 'About Time' is one of the most soppy, sincere and warm films to be produced in the last decade. It's lovely and sweet and makes people - who care to - feel happy. Some have complained that it is too full of poignant  moments and that all the crises are minor, but 'About Time' doesn't have to be 'The Butterfly Effect' simply because it contains time travel. There's no need for murder and heroin addiction; it's not supposed to be gritty, it's sentimental. Some have complained about Tim using his 'powers' to make the world work better for him and those he cares about, but the logical corollary to that is that no one should attempt to make life more pleasant for themselves and others. Seemingly these critics would prefer you do not use your 'powers' of intelligence, charm, wit, sensitivity, etc to live a happy life, but rather crash through it like some resigned misery loving toddler. Finally some have complained that it's simply ridiculous...Of course it is, it's got time travel in it! But if one is able to willingly suspend disbelief enough to take on board the one conceit, what you're left with is the sort of sincere sweetness that was evident in the most memorable parts of 'Love Actually' and which puts one in mind of 'Life is Beautiful' or 'The Eighth Day', and in my book, that is serious praise.",

I especially like The Black Adder TV series, I also liked Notting Hill and Bridget Jones but I absolutely loved Love Actually. I guess you could say that I am in touch with my feminine side to the point where II can appreciate a RomCom or a chick flick for the want of a better phrase. So because of this I was looking forward to seeing About Time and whilst not terrible I really couldn't warm to it in the same way I have with the aforementioned films. My main gripe is the male lead (Domhnall Gleeson) just doesn't have enough gravitas to carry the main role and there is a painful absence of chemistry between himself and Mary (Rachel McAdams). This is almost so to the point where I was saying to myself (yes, I do actually talk to myself when watching films) \"yeah, as if she would show interest in him\" throughout.\n\n\nTim (Gleeson) is an average kind of teenager. The type that is not comfortable around female company (his sister Kit Kat excepted) and one new years eve his father (Bill Nighy) invites him for a quiet chat. He explains to Tim that their family are able to travel back in time. After testing this theory he decides that he is going to use it to find love but finds that whilst he can change things about his own life he cannot influence others in the way he would like. For example, he cannot \"make\" someone fall in love with him. What I would say is that \"there are ways and there are ways Tim\", none of which are either morally correct or in fact legal but I wouldn't let a minor thing like that get in the way!! Tim decides to move to London to stay with a playwright \"friend\" of the family who is possibly the most unfriendly man in the history of time. As you can probably guess the course of true love never runs smoothly and Tim has to go back and forth in time to attempt to correct his woeful inadequacies at just about everything from what I can see?\n\n\nThis is supposed to be a comedy except that it isn't really. There is the one exception of Uncle D who is a little absent minded and forgetful in the most inappropriate of ways but he is very funny and hugely likeable. The problem is that there is just not enough of him. But as ive already said the main issue is that that Mary and Tim are just not believable to me as a couple. I couldn't help but think that Curtis was whispering in McAdams ear throughout \"just think back to when Ryan Gosling and Eric Bana were your love interests, imagine its them now\"? In fairness to the film the underlying message is a worthy one and despite my criticisms I did think it tried to highlight our everyday woes in a positive way and its portrayal of a father and sons relationship was also very positive and one friend of mine found it moving so maybe you will too?",

However, it is worth it for this sweet, touching, romantic film.  \n\nDomhnall Gleeson and the always shimmering Rachel McAdams have such lovely chemistry together.  It is so much more believable than any romantic chemistry I have seen onscreen in years, and yet it is simple and not forced.  But the actor who really stands out is Bill Nighy in one of his more subtle performances.  He is sweet, gentle, and genuine.  \n\nI was surprised at how light this film is, and also how clean it is.  It's a shame that they have to throw in a few \"f-bombs\" to get an R rating because there really is not much else in this film other than some minor sexual talk (most of it among married couples).  It is not nearly as explicit as the nudity and blatant sexuality of Curtis's last film, \"Love Actually\".  This could easily have been PG-13.  \n\nMy only complaint about the film is the shaky camera effect, which fortunately is mild and not all throughout the film but is still a bit of a nuisance.  I don't even understand or like the shaky cam with action films but it is really out of place here.  \n\nOverall this is a sweet film with some fantastic messages.  It is all about living in the moment and enjoying life, and remembering to love and keep your eyes open to opportunity.  I laughed, I cried, and I just felt warm for the two hours of this film.

            "content": "This movie just proves that Richard Curtis is the best at making romantic comedies. Like come on he wrote the first Bridget Jones's Diary movie, he wrote Notting Hill and he wrote and direct Love Actually. I'm a fan of all of those films and that's mostly because of Richard Curtis. His movies are always filled with enjoyable characters, funny dialogue and something that all rom coms fail to do, which is to have believable romance. I'm not a fan of a lot of rom coms, but occasionally when a director makes a good rom com, I find them pretty enjoyable to watch. For me to enjoy a rom com all you have to do as have good writing, funny jokes and believable romance. I'm not looking for beautiful cinematography, top notch visuals, compelling scores and great mood and atmosphere. Those kinds of things are for really good movies, for romantic comedies, all I want to see is good humor, good romance and good writing. So many rom coms fail at not only giving good humor, but good romance as well, which is the reason why I hate rom coms. However, when Richard Curtis is directing the film it's usually an enjoyable watch, which now brings me to his new movie About Time. About Time reminded me a lot of The Time Travelers Wife when I saw the previous, so I was a bit skeptical to see it because I really hated The Time Travelers Wife. I still gave the film a watch because I know Richard Curtis would do his best to make this film work and thankfully he succeeded at that. About Time wasn't anything special and it wasn't better then Love Actually, but the film was a lot of fun to watch. About Time had pretty decent writing, good direction, funny jokes and great chemistry between Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams. Rachel McAdams hasn't played in a good movie for quite some time now, so it was a good change of pace to see her do a good role. Domhnall Gleeson, who plays the lead character was very good in this movie, I thought it was a very smart idea casting him as the lead because he played his part very well. His character was not only funny, but really likeable and you actually gave a shit about his relationship. The supporting cast was really good in this movie as well, like Tom Hollander was hilarious in this movie, Lydia Wilson was really enjoyable to watch, Lindsay Duncan was very memorable, but of course the scene stealer in this movie was Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy is a great actor and just like his performance in Love Actually he was hilarious, fun and the best part of this movie. The writing was also good and Richard Curtis's direction was pretty solid; you can tell this is a Richard Curtis film just by the humor and the acting in this movie. I'm really glad that I enjoyed this movie as much as I did. Like I said there was nothing perfect about the film, but it was really good and I liked watching it and I can probably see myself watching it again in the future.",

The charming formula of Love Actually is there again, with voice-over, British-ish witty conversations (although much rarer than its predecessors), extraordinarily ordinary-life scenes for opening and ending sequences, loves without turbulences, bonding families, attached couples, mended broken hearts, and joys, many joys and happinesses. Still, the plot lacks consistency, maybe due to its sci-fi time-travelling settings, while the characters, although still charming they are, were inadequately and unimpressively depicted with an alarming lack of details and lifelikeness (which were done very, very well in \"Love Actually\"). Therefore, the heart-warming ending could not lift the whole film up and only reminds the audience of a typical Hollywood rom-com yet much more impressive time-travelling family film - \"Click\".",

A young man tries to change his past to have a better future... but doesn't work well most of the times.  Written and directed by Richard Curtis, and starring Domhnall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams and Bill Nighy, this film is like a yo-yo, it has ups and downs and it was like that until the last scene - up, down - up, down...\r\n\r\nThe plot was interesting... just imagine that your father called you at your 21st birthday, like Tim's (Domhnall Gleeson) did, and tells you that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. What an opportunity! Upon learning this, Tim goes back to the night of a recent New Year's Eve party where at midnight he was too shy to kiss someone and goes for the kiss instead. Of course, when you are shy, that seemed like  logical choice!\r\n\r\nIf you don't know the author - Richard Curtis, is a New Zealand born Australian, but he was always regarded as a British screenwriter, music producer, actor and film director. He is definitely one of Britain's most successful comedy screenwriters, primarily for romantic comedy films such as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Bridget Jones's Diary, Notting Hill, and Love Actually, as well as the hit sitcoms Blackadder, Mr. Bean and The Vicar of Dibley. He is also the founder of the British charity Comic Relief along with Lenny Henry. In 2007, Curtis received the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award, the highest award the British Film Academy can give a filmmaker. It is petty that he announced that this is likely to be his last film as director, but that he will continue in the film industry. The sad thing is that this wasn't a high quality work as most of his previous ones, but it wasn't in the bad category either. \r\n\r\nThe chemistry of the leading couple was obvious, but some casting was questionable! Funny moments are scattered, the cute relationship all around the place, and all between were the plot holes. Film's internal logic about time travel was shockingly inadequate and unanswered, and that can put off many of the viewers. I tried to ignore those things and enjoy the comedy and the romance.  \r\n\r\nIf you like light fun and family atmosphere, interesting characters in a charming settings and unsightly pile-up of plot holes and logic problems in one movie - this could be something you'd love to see!",

Unfortunately, I felt it went nowhere, and instead of breaking new ground in terms of a romantic drama, it ended up being a clich\u00e9d film disguised with a neat idea. About Time may have had a chance of being a good film, unfortunately it's just an overdone predictable affair, that fails to really standout or be worth seeing. Don't expect anything good here; this is a film that will leave you disappointed. About Time is a film that just wastes a unique idea and adds every genre clich\u00e9 to appeal to a wider audience. Instead of reinventing the genre, it lingers on, and navigates all too familiar territory that has been set by previous genre films. About Time is a mess, one that isn't worth seeing, and the cast here are wasted on such a bland, uninspired script that doesn't satisfy. This is a film that unfortunately is boring and has no redeeming qualities. About Time could have been a good picture, but it relies too much on predictability to create its story, that it's just not interesting in the long run.  Skip it, and watch something else. This film just fails as drama, and it's a forgettable film that could have been so much more, but doesn't take off due to a not fully fleshed script, poor performances and lazy storytelling. I've seen better films than this, and About Time is a mess from start to finish, and considering some of the talent involved here, I'm in shocked that they couldn't make a better film than this.",

A bit of a ridiculous premise that all the males in the family can travel back in time, but it's an interesting mechanism for not only scenes full of heart but some comedic opportunities as well. The movie's pace can be a bit slow at times but if you make the investment, you'll be rewarded with a touching story surrounded by genuine performances and a positive take home message.\nGleeson nails the main character as this ordinary, dorky guy who just wants a girlfriend and to be happy with his romantic lead, McAdams, who seems to be always cast in these roles, and for good reason, because she delivers on being the loveable female lead. Each of the main characters are portrayed by actors very well. While the secondary characters are all great, each of them either funny or quirky in their own way, the person who really steals the show is Hughes, who is such an amazing actor and with his personal charisma and body language, just makes you wish you had a father like him.\nAs I said before, the movies about relationships and love, but with a breath of fresh air, the movie doesn't spend the entire 120 minutes focusing on the love story; it spends time on the trials and tribulations of other relationships; like Tim's relationship with his sister, his relationship with his mother, his friends and best of all, his father, who is played by Hughes. That relationship is done best of all with a scene at the end which will tug on the heart strings of even the most cynical person. Its brilliantly done and the movie's supplemented by a fantastic soundtrack mixed with pop and indie music, heightening your emotions at appropriate times.\nThe only minor complaint is that the plot mechanic was a bit vague and under-explained, and some characters felt like they could have been forgotten or left out, but it's only at the end you realize that the take home message was worth the entire movie. Live everyday like it's the first and last one; take time and enjoy life; don't stress yourself out or you'll miss out the best parts. The message is delivered over the course of the movie with Gleeson's narration and is expertly closed at the end which is a nod at how well the script was written.  It touched a lot of real issues like loss of loved ones, the importance of family and love; and did these themes so well.\nGreat story; great acting and a message that I'll take with me for the rest of my days. Live your life everyday like it's your first and last. 9/10",

When it comes to the movie I have to admit that it suprised me that it wasn't typical rom-com which was what I was expecting after watching the trailer. However, About Time uses a widely used topic as time travel, to beautifully transmite another widely used message such as living your life day by day and appreciate all the things that happen around you even the smaller ones. Nevertheless despite the fact that the film is a little slow-paced through the half way, it is good enough to put you a smile at the end of it, and that makes it worth watching. Besides that, even the message has been used, it is always good to remember that if you pay attention to the details, happiness is a choice and not an outcome.",

It comes as no surprise here considering he's directed Love Actually, and wrote such rom-coms as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Bridget Jones's Diary, and Notting Hill among others. He has a tendency of melting even the toughest hearts and no matter how prepared you think you are for his next film somehow he gets you again. Perhaps About Time is his most sentimental film and that could turn some people off, but I must say this isn't your typical romantic comedy. Half way through the film it turns into a completely different movie becoming one about family dynamics and enjoying the ordinary moments in life. Perhaps the reason why Curtis gets away with being so charming is that he creates a perfect balance in his stories and introduces comedic relief at the right moments. About Time is a flawed film, but you can probably say this about all his films. The thing a lot of people might have a problem with specifically in this one is the time traveling element which many may find a bit absurd, but it worked for me (at least it was much better than the other time traveling movie that Rachel McAdams starred in) and I think Curtis uses this element as a sort of parable to remind us of the importance of savoring each day. It may feel like a sermon at times, but it's one I don't mind being reminded of. Carpe Diem!\n\nTim (Domhnall Gleeson who you may recognize as Bill Weasley in the last two Harry Potter films) is a shy kid living with his parents (Bill Nighy and Lindsay Duncan) and lovable sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson). The morning of his 21st birthday his father shares with him a family secret: the men in their family can travel in time, but they can only do so to moments they personally have experienced. Tim decides to use this special ability to find love, because he really needs all the help he can get for it. Tim leaves his parents beautiful beachside estate in Cornwall for London in order to become a lawyer. He moves in with one of his father's friends, Harry (Tom Hollander), who's a struggling writer with a bad temper. In London Tim meets Mary (Rachel McAdams) and the two fall for each other, but due to a time traveling incident that night is erased from Mary's memory and Tim has to find another way to win her back.\n\nI feared this film would become another sort of 50 First Dates, but surprisingly it took an unexpected turn halfway through the film and becomes something else. It is not just a romantic comedy, it becomes a movie about family, love, and life where Tim learns a couple of valuable lessons along the way. McAdams and Gleeson shared great chemistry on screen, but the true standouts in this film were the supporting characters, especially Tim's father played by the wonderful Bill Nighy. He is great here once again, while Wilson, Duncan, and Hollander all are extremely funny and used for comedic relief. It's a relief from the schmaltzy sentimentality of the film. It's as if Curtis is admitting he's manipulated us way too much with all the emotional sentimentality and now it's time for a good laugh. If you don't find this film funny then you will probably find it way over the top with the sentimentality. It's not a film for everyone, but I had a good time and was charmed by the story.",

            "content": "About Time stars the Dublin actor Domhall Gleeson (Tim) and Canadian born Rachel McAdams (Mary) in a sci-fi romantic comedy that explores love and life's ironies in a somewhat long winded, overly syrupy, although, genuine manner. When Tim first discovers his ability to travel back in time the audience witnesses his learning curve; to his dismay, after he is rejected by his \"first love\", he quickly finds it is not as easy as he thought to manipulate others. He also realizes that tweaking his past can create ripples into his future which nearly cause him to lose his new love interest, Mary, right after their initial meeting.  Although heartfelt and well-intentioned, those (and many other) uneven and in my opinion, unnecessary, sub plots take such a long time unfolding that I must admit I near shut off my TV.\r\nThankfully, true love does conquer all, or maybe a handy time travelling ability does?  Well, no matter, what's important is how intensely Tim loves Mary immediately, how unbeknownst to her, he recites verbatim thoughts she had already shared with him in the future, averts her meeting the \"other guy\" and ensures that their \"first\" time is unforgettable. \r\nRichard Curtis's directorial mastery is revealed in his use of music and visual to powerfully create sentiment and bring it to life. The early part of Tim and Mary's deliciously sappy, but wonderfully sincere, relationship is brilliantly coupled with a colourful soundtrack and fluttering shots in the subway station that can fill anyone with glee. The beautiful scenes continue to unfold like flipping through a photo album. We watch the love-struck couple wed to Jimmy Fontana's gorgeously penetrating \"Il Mondo\" on a perfectly charming stormy day and begin to expand their loving family tree. Indeed the importance of a connected family unit is a fundamental motif in this movie for it ultimately serves to bring Tim to his most significant realizations and shed light on the irony that holds all life together. It is at some point between child number two and three, and after some difficult developments with Tim's father(Bill Nighy), who he is extremely close with, that he has (and we gratefully with him) an important epiphany; that no amount of changing the past can control or smooth out all the unexpected wrinkles of our lives, and neither can it ever replace letting go and experiencing the timeless now. It is the full-heartedness of the film that, although may not make us laugh out loud, fills us with lightheaded giddiness that make it irresistible.",

            "content": "A new funny film about love. With a bit of time travel. \n\nAmazing Film! Wow I'm so glad I've watch this and it caught me off guard too on how good it was. \"About Time\" is a romantic comedy about the vicissitudes of life and love. It's witty, clever, intelligent and very funny. But it's also a film of perhaps quite surprising depth.The performances, the screenplay, the direction and the soundtrack are first class. The humour is excellent. The film done a fine job in balancing the comedic and dramatic elements of the story, providing enough laughter and allowing it to flow smoothly without feeling too overly long despite its 2 hours running time. The message or overall theme of the film about appreciating life as if it was your last was subtle and not too forceful or preachy.The selection of songs for the film was appropriate and not too overly done for the emotional scenes.The on-screen chemistry between Rachel and Domhnall are convincing enough for the audience to watch them going through life together. On the other hand, Domhnall and Bill, as father and son, their connection is felt throughout the film and certainly evoke some poignant memories when watching them together. It's one of the best romantic comedies this year had to offer. Enjoyable movie that will lift your spirits, and you may even want to watch it again to enjoy the finer details. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes romantic comedies, or a little bit of fantasy. Do yourself a favor and go see it!!!\n\nAt the age of 21, Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) discovers he can travel in time... The night after another unsatisfactory New Year party, Tim's father (Bill Nighy) tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. Tim can't change history, but he can change what happens and has happened in his own life-so he decides to make his world a better place...by getting a girlfriend. Sadly, that turns out not to be as easy as you might think. Moving from the Cornwall coast to London to train as a lawyer, Tim finally meets the beautiful but insecure Mary (Rachel McAdams). They fall in love, then an unfortunate time-travel incident means he's never met her at all. So they meet for the first time again-and again-but finally, after a lot of cunning time-traveling, he wins her heart. Tim then uses his power to create the perfect romantic proposal, to save his wedding from the worst best-man speeches, to save his best friend from professional disaster and to get his pregnant wife to the hospital in time for the birth of their daughter, despite a nasty traffic jam outside Abbey Road. But as his unusual life progresses, Tim finds out that his unique gift can't save him from the sorrows and ups and downs that affect all families, everywhere. There are great limits to what time travel can achieve, and it can be dangerous too.",

The main problem I have with it is that everything seems too good to be true ... and unfortunately I am a little more cynical and like my love stories with a little more realism. And no I am not talking about the time travel bit.",

On New Year's eve , 21-year-old Tim (Gleeson) discovers that the men in his family are able  to travel back to any time in the their past, changing things as they want.  He first uses it to go back to New Year's Eve & set an awkward interaction to right with a girl at the slaughter of midnight. After leaving the countryside for London, Tim meets Mary (McAdams), and falls in love with her. The problems of time travel soon ascend, as he tries to settle everything perfect for his family. Sooner he learns that everything can't be fixed by traveling in time, and he must obey to let some things go.\n\nWhile it has many humorous moments, this is a more mature outing for Curtis, which feels a bit too grandiose in scope. The ideas are interesting, but the way they're presented seems too on the nose, even lazy at times. Of course, it is an enjoyable experience, not unlike Curtis' other work. The cast is quite good as well. Domhnall Gleeson plays a lovable klutz, nailing the comedic scenes and mustering up a soft brokenness in the more dramatic ones. (Really, he should be getting more lead roles after such a turn.) Rachel McAdams' performance is perfectly fine, even if her character feels underdeveloped, and Bill Nighy and Tom Hollander are very entertaining in their smaller roles. There are even cameos by Richard E. Grant and the late Richard Griffiths. Overall, Richard Curtis' latest is a pleasant journey, funny and touching with a solid performance from Domhnall Gleeson.",

There are also dead times where the time travel would not be used and felt like just like a regular love story, thus making the time travel a bit insignificant at times. The score and soundtrack were a bit questionable as well. Even though About Time had its faults, it did not cease to entertain me. It is a beautiful story.

At least not in terms of the grand scope of all films.  They always seem to, by their very nature, land in an uncomfortable grey area of cinema.  They lack both the heart wrenching sorrow of a true drama and the gut busting laughs of a classic comedy. They live in the realm of casual amusements, where a casual chuckle and a few less than poignant life observations are the main attraction.  \nSo as clear as it is that I will not be considering this film among the greats, it is about as great as a romantic comedy can hope to become.  \nWhile nearly all films of the genre deal solely in tired clich\u00e9s, About Time actually makes an attempt to venture off the beaten path.  In the typical rom-com, you know you will always have the same inevitable conflict.  After the boy meets the girl, they soon fall in love, then something happens, they break up/grow apart, and the boy has to figure out a way to win her back.  The theme of such stories being that you should fight for true love and all that good stuff.  About Time doesn't do that however, its theme is much more adult.  And as a result, far more intriguing.  \nAs you will know from the trailers, it is about a young man who learns that the men in his family have the ability to travel in time.  This concept alone opens up a Pandora's Box of possibilities.  Possibilities, which if explored improperly, could have greatly diminished the film.  But everything here is kept exceedingly simple.  Basic rules are established that allow for seamless back and forth travel, but only within the moments you have already experienced.  After a few cautionary tales from his father, and a kind word of advice, we set out with our protagonist on his journey to find the one thing that truly matters. Love.\nI know, it all sounds very sappy.  But it is also very well done.  There are all the hallmarks of a good romantic comedy present within the story.  Moments of levity, hope, and sadness all make cameos.  But it is the message that makes this film unique and enjoyable.  You see, it isn't so much a film about love, but about finding out what is important in life.   7/10",

The lynchpin in this flick, however, proves to be a clever, touching, and unapologetically wonky timey wimey premise that bears a lot of fruit for moviegoers who like, well, sentimental hogwash.\n\nIn this PG-13-rated dramedy, a socially awkward young man uses his newly discovered powers of time travel to get a girlfriend (McAdams). \n\nDid you ever feel like Rachel McAdams earns every flick she's in an extra star? She'll only solidify that theory here. As whimsically fun and touching as Curtis' script is, her heartfelt turn makes the out-there material believable. Elevated from supporting player (see: Ron Weasley's older brother in the Harry Potter films), Domhnall Gleeson proves a risky but ultimately winning choice of everyman. Backed by Curtis veteran Bill Nighy, it doesn't take too much time to swoon for this lovelorn oddity. \n\nBottom line: Love Anomaly",

From the opening strains of a favorite Ben Fold slow-jam to Mary sashaying down the aisle in a fetching red gown to Italian pop opera, this movie just charms and doesn't stop.  The filial and romantic relationships are all so supportive and honest that they made me shit Double Deckers and vomit holy thistle (UK candy and plant to parallel my usual shitting and vomiting of chocolate and daisies).  The meet-cute at one of those vogue blind restaurants is unique, and the rained out wedding scramble is so full of joy.  \n\nI liked Domhnall Gleeson as solemn Levin in Joe Wright's \"Anna Karenina,\" and I like him now as genial and humorous Tim.  I haven't liked Rachel McAdams since \"Mean Girls,\" especially not after time travel/amnesia romance became her bread and butter, but her short, mousey fringe here lends her a normal, unassuming quality.\n\nThe narrative does fall apart around the middle though when the filmmakers realized they needed to inject some conflict; unfortunately, the conflict is of the high stakes but easily-fixed-by-time-travel variety.  I'm really surprised at how little the characters and the movie seem to know about time travel, theoretically.  Does Tim not figure out that if he goes back in time to help his playwright lessor Harry that he forfeits his chance of meeting Mary?  If Kit Kat possesses new memories of being in love with Jay, why doesn't Tim have new memories of the baby boy?  The audience is expected to just roll with his rejection of a living, breathing child because the world of this movie is Tim's, not anyone else's who may have developed strong attachments to this kid, so he's just free to play God, as it were.  It's more than a little unsettling once you think about it.  The sperm explanation doesn't make any sense at all; Tim still risks making changes every day he goes back to relive the pleasures of a day.\n\nAll in all, the romcom parts are sweet and quirky, but the time travel conceit just goes to prove a trite thesis:  the best time is now.",

But then it turns out he may not need time travel after all to find love when he meets Mary(Rachel McAdams) which would be considered love at first sight if it did not happen in a blacked out restaurant.\r\n\r\n\"About Time\" does have certain things going for it such as a totally relatable couple for a change and showing everybody the right way to do a musical montage sequence.  But like Richard Curtis' previous film, the bloated, if entertaining, \"Love, Actually,\" he again proves his willingness to overstuff a romantic comedy to the brim.  This time, he adds time travel into the mix but except for one strange detail does not do anything original with it, as Tim seems content to stalk in the fourth dimension.  That's not to mention the whole business with Tim saving Harry's(Tom Hollander) play being so contrived, since Harry is such a pompous jackass that the Dalai Lama would not even help him.  For the record, that sort of is par for the course in \"About Time\" whose central message is that women can only find true happiness in the most boring man possible, as Tim's dad uses time travel to catch up on his reading.",

However, that film was a much better film than this one. Some scenes felt like copies of scenes from other films like the overflow of rain on the wedding tent (seen in Betsy's Wedding) and the date at the restaurant where everyone can't see each other (seen in When In Rome).\n\nDomhnall Gleeson is ok as Tim. He reminds me a lot of Harry Potter's Rupert Grint. He portrays Tim as clumsy at times. He lacks the charm that Hugh Grant and Bill Murray have. This is the 3rd time travel film that Rachel McAdams has been in (Time Traveler's Wife, Midnight in Paris). She and Gleeson, in my opinion, didn't have a good on screen chemistry. I think another actress in that role would have done a better job, example: Kiera Knightly or Rosamund Pike.  Bill Nighy steals the film as Tim's father. He is the best thing about this film.",

Tim's father tells him that the men in his family can travel through time and well he uses that power to find himself a girlfriend. He's awkward and quite frankly has no luck what so ever with the opposite sex. I loved the way the movie opened with him describing his family and the routine they go through and how he just loves his family to death.\n\nThen he finds out about his powers and uses them for stuff like kissing a girl and not making himself look like a total fool. Then the humor becomes a huge part when he moves in with playwright Harry, literally everything that comes out of his mouth is just pure comic genius. Then he meets Mary played by the adorable and just plain wonderful actress Rachel McAdams. He instantly falls in love with her and a relationship forms and we watch and its beautiful. Never has there been a movie so unrealistic with time travel but almost incredibly realistic with relationships and love.\n\nBut then it goes from being about using time travel to craft the perfect relationship from being about moving on in life and being okay with who you are and appreciating what you've got. That's where it got really emotional. A big point is about the relationship with his father and how they are so close and I think that's a great thing to put in so a lot of people can relate to.\n\nOverall this is the best movie of the year so far and has great performances, good humor and an amazing relatable and heartfelt story that should have a lot of people falling in love with this movie. This is a true romantic, funny dramatic masterpiece.\n\nGrade: A+\n#5 FAVORITE MOVIE OF 2013",
