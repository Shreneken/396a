The producers and actors are able to twist a \"damsel in distress\" film and make it into something extraordinary that never fails to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright envelop every part of their characters gracefully and indulge the audience in sweet romance. While Mandy Patinkin plays Inigo swiftly and effortlessly and Wallace Shawn portrays Vizzini who gives the film an idiotic yet comedic environment. Unknowingly becoming an outstanding movie of its time The Princess Bride continues to captivate younger viewers even today.",

And Mandy Patinkin is deliciously hammy as the man who wishes to avenge his father's death by killing his six-fingered murderer.

I actually really enjoyed seeing this for the first time in college seven-ish years ago and rewatching it tonight for this review. On a film-as-a-work-of-art level, this movie really suffers. The production design is pretty cheap, the cinematography is fine at best and pretty uninspired at worst, and the score is pretty cheesy all the way around. That being said, though, the tone is what makes Princess Bride works-at no point does this movie want you to take it seriously and that's why it has endured so well.\n\nThe screenplay and comedic performances are where Princess Bride really shines. There are so many iconic lines and bits in the film, it would be futile to try to compile the list here of times I smiled or laughed. The ensemble cast was full of lovable characters spouting iconic lines of dialogue, definitely worth revisiting again and again. I have to point out the child acting performance of the boy who played the boy being read the story. His line delivery was pitch-perfect, and I laughed out loud more than a few times at his running commentary on the story.\n\nThis movie is so fun and I adore it, but as a finished product of cinema, I've definitely seen better.

Of course, Reiner deserves only half the credit, because his film brings to life this unusual, inventive story and screenplay by William Goldman.  Cary Elwes and Robin Wright are perfectly cast, and Many Patinkin deserves special kudos for his outstanding performance.",

            "content": "Another quarantine film appreciation class with my kids was a hit (\"Labyrinth\" also got a thumbs-up. \"E.T.\" got a Meh). From writer William Goldman (\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" \"All the Presidents Men\" \"Misery\") and director Rob Reiner (\"This is Spinal Tap\" \"Stand by Me\" \"When Harry Met Sally\" and also \"Misery\") comes a very subversive fairy tale send-up. It's charming and wimiscal enough that the kids will love it and it's witty and subversive that adults will love it even more so. What makes this parody film unique is that while Goldman and Reiner are certainly poking fun at fairy tale tropes, they also tell a fairy tale with genuine charm and sweetness. Compared to other parody films like \"Blazing Saddles\" or \"Airplane\" which are entirely mocking and ridicule, \"The Princess Bride\" is at its heart is still a fairy tale love story. I won't bother summarizing the story, since I'm assuming everyone has already watched this film, but \"The Princess Bride\" boasts a stellar cast, led by then unknown Cary Elwes (\"Robin Hood: Men in Tights\" \"Glory\" \"Days of Thunder\" \"Stranger Things\") and Robin Wright (\"Forrest Gump\" \"Moneyball\" \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" \"House of Cards\"). The scene stealing supporting cast has SO many iconic moments! Wallace Shawn shouting \"Inconceivable!\" and the battle of wits face-off. Peter Cook's speech impaired clergyman. Mel Smith's throat clogged Albino. Carol Kane and Billy Crystal as the bickering Valerie and Miracle Max. Mandy Patinkin's Inigo Montoya is the main standout in the cast, who's performance still gave me chills when he has his final confrontation with Christopher Guest's six-fingered Count Rugen. Patinkin brings a level of emotion to the film that brings unexpected depth and heart. Then there's the enormous Andr\u00e9 the Giant, who pretty much steals every scene he's in. I also usually dislike wraparound  or story bookends, but Fred Savage and  Peter Falk are wonderful as a grandfather and grandson reading the story together, which affords lots of opportunities for commentary on the story and to even skip over the boring parts. The film's Once-Upon-A-Time feel is greatly aided is a lush score by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits and beautiful  photography by Adrian Biddle (\"Aliens\" \"Thelma & Louise\" \"V for Vendetta\") that gives the film a timeless feel. On the downside, the film's villains seem underdeveloped and not all that interesting. Also, the film does have some pacing issues where the story drags a bit at times. Still, those are minor quibbles for a film that really does deserve its status as a classic film that both kids and adults (for different reasons) will enjoy. FUN FACT: Andr\u00e9 the Giant called almost everybody on set (be they director, producers, co-stars or crew) \"boss\", a technique he employed to defer to people he liked and go some way towards counteracting the way he would tower over them.",

This film is an absolute embarrassment and I cannot recommend it  to anyone of any age. \n\nUsually I am in agreement with Rotten Tomatoes and their opinions about movies. But when they score The princess bride a 97% and give it a \"certified fresh\" sticker, It calls into question their entire website and career choice. This film has it all. Poor acting, embarrassing set design, cringe worthy characters, tinny music and a terribly written storyline. Let's first start with the acting. Im imagining the casting session where all the candidates showed up and auditioned and they just picked the worst ones. They acting was nothing like i'd ever seen before. The lines were delivered with less than no emotion. The facial expressions resembled pieces of sour tart fruit. The body language was flaccid and unconvincing. The way the actual movie was portrayed was a disgust to the entire motion picture art. It is a mortification that this movie stands by others. \n\nLet's now divulge into the actual storyline. The Princess Bride is about a forbidden love story between a princess and a farm boy. Shocking and predictable. I can appreciate where the story was trying to go, poor farm boy going through extreme lengths to get the desirable girl of his dreams. But the cheesy and mediocre rendering of this is why the movie is so bad. The trenching through the forest, the wine test and sword fights. If I ever have to hear the word \"inconceivable\" said so many times in a row by a fat wrinkled man again I will slam my tongue in a car door. This was an annoying film, which, when studied for an English assignment and made to watch over and over again, became torturous and agitating. I cannot express how notoriously bad this film was. It was very cliche. The poor, up for debate handsome, farm boy charms the princess into being with himself instead of the intended prince bachelor. I think someone dies, though I can't really remember, I don't want to remember.",

            "content": "More than 30 years ago, audiences were introduced to a movie that has become one of the greatest and most beloved romantic comedies of all time in The Princess Bride.  This cinema classic has stood the test of time.  It's still just as enjoyable today as it was when it originally debuted in theaters in 1987.  Whether one is a fan of the comedy drama or fantasy and romance, The Princess Bride is able to appease audiences of all three genres.  So what is it that makes it such a timeless work?  It all starts with the writing.  It's a simple love story with more than enough romance, sword fighting, and satire to appease both male and female audiences.  Along with the writing, the acting of Cary Elwes and Robin Wright (and their supporting cast) and the directing of Hollywood legend Rob Reiner play their own role in the movie's success.  And now in its 31st year as one of the movie industry's greatest movies, the bonus features included in the latest re-issue make it that much better.  The writing behind The Princess Bride is one of the biggest factors in the success of the movie.  This movie isn't the first time that a movie has ever been adapted from a book.  That the story would actually be told from the book in the movie itself is in itself a funny joke.  [Rob] Reiner doesn't mention anything about this in the additional commentary, but one can't help but laugh at the thought that here is a story being told on screen within the context of a movie that has been adapted from the same book being read to the then very young Fred Savage.  Staying in that same vein, the movie does change a few things here and there.  But for the most part, it makes a valiant effort to stay true to author William Golding's book by the same name.  Knowing this serves to make the movie that much more enjoyable.\n\nThe writing behind The Princess Bride is enjoyable as it tries to stay so close to the original book by William Golding.  Add in the acting of an all-star cast and the movie becomes even more enjoyable.  The chemistry and comedic timing of Cary Elwes and his castmates makes for so much laughter throughout the course of the movie's near two hour run time.  Those laughs brought on by the cast's acting are clean laughs.  As Reiner notes in the commentary, it's clean enough for audiences of all ages to enjoy, which is part of the reason for the story's longevity.  Audiences will also thrill at Rob Reiner's comment in the bonus feature, \"True Love: The Princess Bride Phenomenon\" that no one but Cary Elwes and Robin Wright could play the roles of Wesley and Princess Buttercup.  And audiences will agree with that sentiment, too in watching the new interview included in this new edition.\n\nReiner's commentary and his sit down with Elwes and Wright add so much more context to the acting and the writing that makes The Princess Bride such a wonderful adaptation.  His sit down with Elwes and Wright are new additions to this newest edition of the classic flick.  Along with it, this edition also culls the special features from the movie's previous DVD releases for the first time.  There's also a new feature title, \"Love is Like a Storybook.\"  It offers a more in depth look at specific elements of the story, making for that much more appreciation for the whole thing.  All combined, the bonus features and the commentary make this classic story that much better.  Add in great acting and equally impressive writing, and it goes without saying that The Princess Bride will continue to be a fan and family favorite for another quarter of a century.",

The type of humor that this movie uses is a sarcastic, witty humor with simple lines. \n\nDon't leave this review believing that this is a bad movie, I am simply explaining its simplicity. The movie starts with a farm boy and a girl falling in love and the farm boy having to leave to make money. The woman is left to believe that her farm boy was killed by the evil pirate. She is forced to move on and marry another man. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three men. Her farm boy comes for her rescue in a disguise and takes down the men, one by one. He reveals himself to her and they are finally brought together again. They are trying to escape from the King's men who are trying to find the Princess. They are caught and Wesley is held in a torture chamber. The two men from the beginning of the movie come to help Wesley escape and get the princess back before she marries the King. At the end, Wesley and the Princess are happy together forever. \n\nI recommend this movie to you if you enjoy a good romantic comedy. Don't watch this movie if you are looking for a crazy, King story. ",

One of the was a swordsman who has a cocky nature and finds himself losing to the protagonist later into the movie. The \"leader\" is an intellectual that also has a cocky feeling to him, who actually dies due to his intelligence taking over his choices. The last of the three is a giant who is not cocky like the others, but he is not the smartest out of them. He is a great character to add although he might not be the best developed, he does bring light to the other characters. The giant is 100% viable due to his size it wouldn't be surprising in real life. The story started with a farmer boy who later develops to a protagonist for a princess. The protagonist doesn't necessarily have a cocky personality, but he does have a really humble heart, and he does find peace within the rest of the story. The whole story basically revolves around a princess and a lover storyline. That doesn't have a lot of holes, and is very enjoyable. This movie is old but it still satisfies my movie tastes. Overall The Princess Bride is a well developed movie with a great character development that will prove to be one of the best literary adaptations in my books.",

The Princess Bride is a predictable yet enjoyable movie, and although almost every twist and turn was seen by the minds predictions they chose the still entertaining ones. If you are expecting a grand epitome of ideas then this movie is simply not for you, but if you simply want to watch a movie for fun this no look further. The plot follows a basic premise a love story torn apart and brought back together by fate and will. A man who lost his bride, who also happened to be a princes, must  overcome three men. When he does so he finds his love but waits to reveal his identity to her. When he does so they venture off on a sort of reunion trip. The prince whom the princess was supposed to marry finds then and takes the princess away. Seeing the other man as a rival he lies to the princess and takes the man away to a torture dungeon under the castle. The man almost dies but is saved by two of the men from earlier. Together the three storm the castle, defeat the prince, and reunite the princess and her love. The story it's time when it needs to and has many enjoyable confrontations between the characters. The characters you want to die die, and the characters you don't want to don't. My only strife with this film is the weird and unnecessary subplot that takes place in the background between a grandson and his grandfather. The story will pause for a few minutes to show annoying and unwanted banter between the two to display that the whole story is actually just a tale. Overall, if you can take away from it's biggest weakness you can find a good watch. I would recommend this film to anyone with spare time.",

It's the classic tale of a man saving his woman through many obstacles and challenges. The movie starts with a boy who is playing video games in his bed. His grandfather then comes in and decides to read him a bedtime story. It starts with Wesley having to travel across the sea and the story takes place later with three men kidnapped Buttercup to start a war. As the three men travel with Buttercup Wesley is after them and defeats each man one by one. The story continues as Wesly and Buttercup go through a few obstacles themselves like quicksand and huge, aggressive, possums. They then run into the King and Wesley gets knocked out and placed in a torture basement. Andre the Giant and Inigo take Wesley out of the basement and plan on taking Buttercup back from the King. They do so by causing fear in the first line of defense through Fizzik in a costume on fire. Wesley gets Buttercup back from the king and Inigo gets his revenge on the six fingered man for killing his father. All while taking a throwing knife in the gut. It ends with everyone running off in white horses and everyone lives happily ever after. As the Grandfather finishes the book and leaves the room, the boy asks if he can come back tomorrow to read the book again. \n\nThis adventure filled comedy is a classic to many people including myself. I think the choice of actors is great especially with Andre The Giant portraying a giant with a sensitive side to himself. This movie is filled with comedy scenes, especially when Wesleye outsmarts Vizzini which he then proceeds to knocking out and dying from his cockiness. For most of the movie you do forget that the Grandfather is reading this story to his grandson. This movie is a perfect 5/5 stars, and is very deserving of this rating through the acting and storytelling. \n",

For a fantasy movie, it was quite funny and I really enjoyed that aspect of the film. \n     The story is also amazing to say the least. It revolves around a man named Westley and a woman named Buttercup. Westley wants to marry this woman, but he can't do that. So he goes away and Buttercup believes that he has died. Little does she know that he is still alive and wants to find her to marry her. He also has to save her from this prince who wants to be with her as well, so he bands together with a giant named Fizziz and a spaniard named Inigo Montoya. They go on a quest to save Buttercup from the prince and must overcome many obstacles. \n     Finally the cast of the movie is great.

This movie was Ok but it was amazing, why was that amazing? Well I'll show you everything why. A kid plays the NES and then his grandfather comes in and gave him a present that was a book and he starts to read the book and the kid seems to enjoy it. The humphrey and Buttercup fell in love but then left each other, then the king wants to marry the lady but he feels like something could happen, But Buttercup doesn't like the king. The king or humphrey want to date Buttercup but then things get frisky. She got kidnapped by a guy, a giant, and a man. She had to escape but he mentioned that there are shrieking eels but they caught her and then they sailed for the canyon. They climb up a mountain and find a new place before the prince can find her. Someone had to distract the prince. They both talk for a bit. And they start to duel and the spanish prince won. The guy starts to get mad and tells the giant to hit him with the rock but failed. And they start to wrestle. He finished the giant and the swordsman and he runs to the kidnapper meanwhile the other knights chase after him and track him down and they meet and they talk it out the hard way. They do a wine roulette and the spanish prince won. Meanwhile the knights try to find the princess.The Spanish prince was actually a thief and he kidnapped the princess. She pushed him and she falls too but they survive and they fall in love. The knights are still on the search for the princess. While the thief and the princess kissed. And the kid wants to skip it. The thief and the princess saw the knights coming for her, and they went to an evil forest and stayed safe for the time being. They drowned in quicksand but made it out alive. They got attacked by a rat and she manages to do something and they kill the rat. And then they got caught by the knights and they start to get separated. The thief was silenced and he was then taken to the place of despair. The princess is now in the castle and now trying to be queen but then a lady confronted her but it was a nightmare and runs to the king and says that she loves Westly but the king thinks she shouldn't love him. The king then starts to think that she would have to let go of Westly and then leave the princess to herself. The kingdom starts to get rid of the Thief forest but the Guy and the Giant survive out of the Kings demands of rebuilding a new kingdom and come up with a plan. The king gets mad and sends the princess to get westly and sent her to her dungeon and trying to torture Westly. So the man and the giant are on a mission. And then the kid interrupted and Westly died and things got bad. The 2 got him and took him to a nearby old wizard to heal him. Westly lives and they help him. The bride then prepares and things start to turn. The Wedding starts and then the battle begins and the giant scares them with a fire trick. They went in the castle and the spanish guy fights some guy who looks like Napoleon III. The spanish guy almost got defeated by Napoleon III and keeps fighting him until Napoleon died. Westly and Buttercup fell in love and kissed, the villain and Westly start fighting. Westly roasted the villain. The villain has surrendered and Westly won the fight. and then the whole kingdom is saved. Westly and Buttercup reunited and they both fell in love and became king and queen and they fell in love. And they all lived happily never after. The Grandpa left and the kid told him he loved the book. The story for this is alright but it did have some funny parts in it. The characters are mostly known from other films but the characters fit good for the film even the villain didn't die this time. This movie completely struck as the best movie of the century, I'm sure no one can deny it too. I can say this movie is amazing no matter what. 9/10",

            "content": "The Princess Bride. An old film with a story within a story. One simple sweet scenario of a grandpa accompanying his sick grandson by reading him a story. With another story going on in the book grandpa was reading. The storyline of the book is filled with love and princesses and pirates and kidnapping. The sick boy is accompanied by his grandfather who decided to come over and watch him, whilst reading one of his favorite books \"The Princess Bride\". At first the boy is uninterested and doesn't really want to read the book with his grandfather until his grandfather began reading and the boy got more and more interested as the story escalated. Within that story they were reading, it spoke upon this young couple who was in love and very much head over heels about one another. Until one day, the young man leaves and never returns, leaving the young woman heartbroken and sad. The journey of this double storyline film is engaging, interesting, and very humorous. \n\nIn my opinion, there should've been more scenes of the boy and the grandfather reacting to the scenes of the storyline. Aside from that, the soundtrack and dialogue was well followed through and executed well. Although the effects of the fighting/acting scenes weren't THAT believable, it still entertained me, the audience. \n\nSo to recommend this film? Yes, it is worthy to watch. This film has a family feel to it, meaning it can be watched with children, adults, elders and etc. The storyline within the storyline is eye catching, and the details are specific with a reasonable length of the movie.\n\nThe Princess Bride, approved by me. A fun, thrilling, love story film with good dialogue, humor, and a not too slow storyline. The perfect move for just about anybody. Although it is an older film, it still has an engaging feel to it. \n",

I would have to say though that I did like how they made this whole world into a story that is being read by a grandpa to his grandson I thought that was sweet. It was cute to see the transition of the little boy listening to the story going from ew a love story to asking his grandfather if he could come the next day to read it to him again. Some things though that I did not quite love about the movie were the kind of cheesy humor I just was not really amused by and the name of Buttercup being given the princess bride I would have to say kind of threw me off because when her name was first said I thought it was for her horse. I think there were probably a lot better options for the name of a beautiful princess bride than Buttercup. It was a really corny title and I just couldn\u00b4t take the scene seriously when they were addressing her with that name. Furthermore, the movie was not bad and I would be willing to give it another shot sometime if a person was a fan of fantasy I think you would most likely enjoy this film a little more than I did.",

The only two characters who I found to be a little annoying at times were Buttercup and the grandson, but luckily they didn't distract me from the film that much.\n\nThe sets and costumes were very strong and detailed, especially with the look and design of the castle.\n\nThe music was steady and filled its purpose, but I do wish that they focused on it a little more instead of just pushing it to the side.\n\nThe comedy in my opinion was hands down the strongest aspect of the film, especially the scenes involving the main characters talking to the side characters.\n\nThe film I also found to be really entertaining, and I hope to watch it again soon.\n\nOver all I give it a\n8/10\n\n\"My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die\"",

            "content": "A delightful romance fantasy tale!\n\nDirector Rob Reiner's fantasy romance comedy The Princess Bride (1987) is a sweet product of its time. It takes Mark Knopfler's very 1980's style music and a quaint framing device of a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his sick grandson. William Goldman's story is a fun romance drama about true love with a ridiculous comedy style where nonsense happens because it's fun. Reiner's direction is fanciful and fun at all times. The cuts to Peter Falk's narration are neat as is the epic journey within The Princess Bride's brief 98 minute run-time.\n\nPeter Falk is awesome as the kindly grandfather reading to his bratty, yet eager grandson. Fred Savage plays the grandson with a willful ignorance many young boys have that slowly reveals him to be a thoughtful young man that yearns to be more emotionally open. His grandfather teaches a valuable lesson about love, appreciation, and adventure! Falk is one of The Princess Bride's greatest attributes as his portrayal is so gentle, witty, and adoring towards Savage that he endears himself to you immediately. I love Peter Falk as Grandpa in The Princess Bride.\n\nCary Elwes is wonderful as the heroic Westley. His charm and charisma are dauntless as he effortlessly delivers hilarious dialogue and quirky insults. Robin Wright is lovely and loyal as Princess Buttercup. Her devotion to and chemistry with Elwes is excellent. They play well together.\n\nMandy Patinkin is riveting as the sword master Inigo Montoya on the hunt for revenge after his father's murder. His fencing duel with Cary Elwes is one of the best in cinema history as is his climactic moment with his foil Christopher Guest's cruel Count Rugen. Their duel is fierce and directed beautifully by Rob Reiner in a serious dramatic way. Montoya is my favorite character in The Princess Bride as you are endeared by his quest and entertained by his compelling performance.\n\nI have to mention Montoya's criminal travelling companions. The lovable Andre the Giant is so quaint as the simple-minded and good-hearted Fezzik. It's cool watching The Princess Bride and seeing this hulking gentle giant have fun with his friends. Wallace Shawn is gut busting as the abusive and arrogant Vizzini. His challenge of the minds with Cary Elwes is perhaps the best writing in the film.\n\nI do not like Chris Sarandon as Prince Humperdinck. He's kind of generic and has less charisma and presence than the other brilliantly cast actors. At least Mel Smith gets a funny cameo as the sadistic Albino. On the other hand of Sarandon is the comedy Billy Crystal as Miracle Max. He gets such a memorable and ridiculous cameo that you cannot forget Crystal as the potion swindling Miracle Max in The Princess Bride. Overall, the cast of the film elevates the comedic to genuine dramatic moments like Montoya's redemption or Elwes' romance with Wright. At the same time, the comedic moments will keep you laughing even though there could be more jokes.\n\nIn all, The Princess Bride isn't Rob Reiner's best direction, that would be Stand by Me, nor his best comedy, that would be This Is Spinal Tap; however, The Princess Bride is always a pleasure to watch. It continues to be a dreamy experience of enjoyable fantasy adventure, silly comedy situations, and sweet romantic encounters.",

Revenge is just, such an ugly character type to have if you're not gonna have the character see how aggressive it is. And like, he was seen as a hero afterward!

The Princess Bride is a film which tries to do a lot of things and succeeds at all of them. The romance between Buttercup and Wheatley is genuinely effective - I wanted the two characters to end up together, unlike many movie romances where I don't care. The comedy is also effective, in large part thanks to the snappy dialogue - I don't amuse easily, and the scene where Vizzini is trying to guess which glass is poisoned legitimately made me laugh. As an adventure film, The Princess Bride is one of the best I've seen recently, with a fast pace and the occasional well-choreographed action scene such as the duel between Inigo Montoya and the Man in Black. The heroes are even more memorable than the action, with the snarky Wheatley, the honorable, revenge-obsessed swordsman Inigo Montoya, and the bumbling but well-meaning giant Fezzik. My only real criticism of the film is that Buttercup is bland compared to some of the other characters. On a final note, given that many adaptations are criticized for unfaithfulness, this film is as close as possible to the author's vision for an adaptation - William Goldman pushed for a film adaptation of his novel and wrote the film's screenplay himself.",

I also never noticed before that the actual plot of the villain is a bit convoluted.  But the thing is, none of that matters.  In fact, it's almost part of the charm.  The comedy works, the adventure works, the sense of fun just works.  The camp is part of the charm, and all you need to know about the story is beat the bad guy and true love conquers all.

And the fact that this is the first time I watch it, and I don't feel that it has aged even a little bit is more than a proof of the movie's immortality. But it's not only that it has stood the test of time; it seems that it also remain as subversive as it was back in the eighties. Imagine if Shrek's sarcastic tone and in-jokes didn't come at the expense of the heart of the story, and you would get this movie. (Except that the story is completely different, and it has no ogres, and ....... actually the movies are totally different from each other but you get the idea anyway!)\n\nWith an awesome mix of swashbuckling, romance, comedy, fantastical elements, and insanely likable iconic character brought to life by a perfect cast, Rob Reiner put a magical spin on a happily-ever-after fairy tale and made it eternally fresh. But what stands out for me is the humor in particular. I was surprised by how the humor works perfectly well from the first second up to the very end of the movie. There is no single joke or gag that fails to land. The movie goes for the laughs relentlessly, and while this is a risk for sure; there are no joke that misses the mark. In fact, I couldn't stop giggling, and even laugh out loud, throughout this entire enjoyable adventure. I think the reason behind the movie's brilliant humor is that on the surface, the movie, of course, looks like an epic fantasy tale that its biggest concern is to show the heroic deeds of the protagonist and the lovely romantic relationship between him and his mistress; while Reiner insists, at any point of the movie no matter how serious it is, to take advantage of his eccentric characters and the fairly weird circumstances they face in an astonishing way leaning on the extremely witty dialogue and the charming cast.\n\nUnfortunately, I have some small issues with the movie. First, I think the movie could have been more heartwarming than it is simply by making the dialogue between the grandson and his grandpa half as smart and vivid as that of the fairy tale. The movie is full of heart, though, but largely due to the movie's sincerity and genuineness. Secondly, I guess the movie could have moved more gracefully and fluidly from an act to another, as I felt that the structure was a bit staged. Thirdly, the the third act seems as if it betrayed a certain message, or rather a certain underlying theme that it had been establishing throughout its first two acts. That said, the third act is utterly satisfying, and it proves that The Princess Bride is a very solid film that even its flaws can't be easily noticed or take away anything from watching it.\n\nRob Reiner walks a very thin line between presenting a cute romantic damsel-in-distress story and a parody fairy tale. As a result, The Princess Bride is a good-hearted one-of-a-kind fantasy epic adventure of an enduring value.\n\n(8/10)",

Buttercup is a sweet young lady who gets taken by the prince to become the queen. She runs away with a horse and gets captured by three men in a boat, Inigo Montoya, Vizzini, and Fezzik. My favorite part is when Vizzini and westley do russian rulet with poisoned wine but westley is immune to it and poisons both cups and kills Vizzini. Fezzik might seem stupid and dumb but can help with lost of stuff. That is why the princess bride is the best movie EVER.",

It is a film that is entertaining for all ages thanks to balancing multiple themes and genres all within a medieval fantasy that stands up even when compared to the old timey classics.\n\nDread Pirate Roberts manages to show excellent merit in his heroism while still showing enough humanity to not devolve into a Mary-Sue. Most of the characters bring their own comedy to the film in a way that fits their characters well; with the heroes being charming and the villains being clowns. \n\nI also praise the depiction of Inigo and Fezzik; not only for the great actors but for their roles in the story. It would have been easy to make these minions as bland and pure evil mooks; instead they are ironically honorable and kind, to the point that the audience invites their defection to the heroes.\n\nI will mention a major flaw in this film: Buttercup. This is significant since this film is part romance, and yet I see no reason why anyone would want this bride; she is weak, frequently nasty to others, and is easily overshadowed by the more memorable characters. She even has a moment where she has faith in being rescued, only for her to attempt suicide literally minutes later because she thought she was officially married to someone she hated: apparently liking an infamous pirate is alright, but breaking a marriage is impossible.",

This one hits all the right notes, from the gently-plucked musical score (provided by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits) to the familiar-yet-surprising twists and turns of the plot to the positively irreplaceable casting decisions.\n\nThat last one really stuck with me on this viewing, the realization that every single part was filled by the perfect actor. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright as the smitten, star-crossed lovers; Mandy Patinkin in a vigoriously youthful revenge role, complete with a spectacularly great catchphrase; Andre the Giant as the good natured, softly-spoken mountain of a man; Wallace Shawn as a smooth-talking Sicilian who might be too smart for his own good; Billy Crystal and Carol Kane effortlessly lightening the mood; Christopher Guest as a cowardly enforcer; Peter Falk and Fred Savage as the story's connection to the modern world. Take away any one of those players and the film suffers.\n\nRob Reiner, working from novelist William Goldman's screenplay, brings an inherently literary tale to life in ways that must have seemed impossible at the onset. Together, they deliver just the right mix of levity and romance, dramatic tension and comic timing. A few seams show here and there, particularly when scenes aren't shot on-location or monsters threaten the key players, but somehow that just adds to the bemusing magic of it all. Tough to think of a better love letter to the not-so-innocent myths of old, or a more timeless rendition of their common themes.",

Rob Reiner still needs to ante up the game for this time the feature got saved due to the enormous potential of its script.

            "content": "When I first started watching the movie I was told that it was going to be really bad. I had never heard of this movie until like 5 minutes before I started watching it. At the very beginning it did not seem like such an interesting movie starting off with a kid whose sick playing his video games then the mom coming in and start complaining about him being sick. It just wasn't interesting. It made me want to stop watching it right then and there. Once the grandfather started reading the book and the official story started it was super super cringy for me to watch. It made me want to stop watching even more. The grandfather narrating the storyline for a bit seemed like a great thing I really liked that. The farm boy seemed to be sorta funny with his single line of \"As you wish\" but that was it. Everything else about that beginning love story was pure cringe. Like when buttercup asked farm boy to get her a pan of some sort that was like literally 2 feet away from her it made me just go wow.\nAfter all that cringe, it was just a classic love story. Her lover dies in a tragic accident at sea and she gets super sad having to move on, she gets taken away to be the new princess when she doesn't want to and of course the prince is a terrible evil guy. Soon she gets kidnapped and taken away by three bandits and has to be rescued by her hero. It's basically like a fairytale love story.\nWhen I was watching the film there were some scenes that you could say were too bright. You could see the super bright lights on set reflecting of the rocks way to much. The sun shining would not look like that at all. A couple of scenes you could tell super easily that everything was fake and you could say made cheaply. However some scenes were actually very good like when they were in the forest it looked like they were in a real forest and I liked how it looked. Some scenes seemed to have dark humor which I personally thought it was funny but some people might not think the same. Other scenes like in the water there were these eels that actually looked realistic and were super cool. Something I really seemed to like about the movie was the way the characters talked. They had that fancy type of high class talk and it really went along with the movie perfect. A couple of movie mistakes were seen if you look very closely. They weren't anything too completely crazy but they were there. It was things like props being in different spots throughout a scene, you could see crew equipment in other scenes, hair being in a different position between shots, fire being too far away to burn buttercup in one scene. One when wesley lands far away from his sword but in the next shot he is right next to it. A sorta major mistake was when you could clearly see buttercups stunt double was actually a man with a full beard. \n. The bandits, Vizzini as the leader, Fezzik as the muscle, and Inigo Montoya as a swordsman. I personally really liked these three since they were the funniest out of everyone. Vizzini with his classic line of \"inconceivable\" was really funny for me and I think it really set a fan base for him. He was definitely one of the funniest characters in the movie. Fezzik was the classic friendly giant that was taken for granted by vizzini. Inigo Montoya said he was just a part of this for the meantime till he got enough money to hunt down the man who killed his father. One part of the movie that was very funny to me was when the three bandits were being chased by a man in black. All of their interactions were very funny.\nOverall i thought this movie was great. I went into it expecting it to be like garbage but in the end after it was all over i wished i could see it again. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.",

With just about everything you could ask for in a film, It's no wonder \"classic\" and Princess Bride get used a lot in the same sentence.\n\nFor the four of you that haven't seen the film (five before I finally made my wife sit down and watch), The Princess Bride is simply about a hero trying to rescue his true love from the clutches of an evil king. Cary Elwes stars as hero Wesley trying to save his love Buttercup (Robin Wright). He's a dashing savior, as quick with his tongue as he is with his sword. His delivery is flawless and you will find yourself cracking up just by his natural mannerisms. The rest of the cast is equally as delightful, if not moreso in some cases. My personal favorite was Carol Kane as Valerie. Even as I type this I have a big smile on my face thinking about her running into the room screaming, \"Liar! LIARRRR!\"\n\nThe comedy is the engine that drives this film. It's funny and in a number of ways. Sometimes subtle. Sometimes downright in your face. There are too many memorable lines/scenes to count. From \"So tweasure your wove\" to \"Inconceivable!\" to \"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya...\" Not only do these memorable moments come a dime a dozen, they stand the test of time.\n\nA CLASSIC that will not die.

A grandfather comes to visit his sick grandson and read him The Princess Bride, a story about Buttercup, a princess who falls in love with a farm boy, Westley, and what befalls her after his apparent death at the hands of the Dread Pirate Roberts. This is an incredibly charming film that openly mocks the fantasy genre whilst also playing into it with a nice mixture of comedy, romance and action. It's no wonder The Princess Bride has become a cult classic, it's full of satire, eccentric characters, brilliant one liners and iconic performances across the board. Robin Wright is good as Buttercup, who is usually the straight man in the comedic moments, Cary Elwes has a brilliantly dry wit as Westley, Wallace Shawn is wonderfully neurotic as Vizzini, Billy Crystal is hysterical as Miracle Max and Andre Rene Roussimoff is incredibly loveable and charming as Fezzik the giant. Mandy Patinkin adds a lot of drama and heart to the film as Inigo Montoya, a man in search of revenge for his murdered father, and has perhaps the most quotable line in the whole piece. \nThe cinematography is also excellent, with great lighting and camera work. The sets are wonderful, with a lot of scenes set in the countryside, real locations and well built sets. The props and costumes are also brilliantly detailed and well made. The soundtrack is excellent, really adding a lot to climactic moments and moment of humour and also encapsulating the feeling of fantasy and romance. The fight scenes are well choreographed and performed, particularly the sword fight between Inigo and Westley and are well integrated into the plot. There are only a few parts of the film that don't hold up so well. First is the scene with the ROUS, which is quite clearly someone in a costume and the rather strange way that Westley, Fezzic and Inigo get into the castle to save Buttercup. The biggest problem I have with this film however, is a scene where Westley threatens to hit Buttercup, even though he's pretending to be someone else, this seems very out of character and far too dark for what's supposed to be a romantic plot. \nOverall though, this is a very enjoyable, funny film that stands the test of time. I will happily watch it over and over again as I wish.",

The only disappointing thing about it is that the cast members didn't invite me to their reunion.  Don't they realize I'm their biggest fan???  Inconceivable!  I guess I just need to get used to disappointment.\n\nSo what is it about?  Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles.  Doesn't sound so bad, right?  Just try and stay awake...because if you don't I'm gonna have to emulate the movie and say \"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\"  \n\nI mean, you seem a decent fellow...I hate to kill you.  So I need you to love this movie as much as I love it.  After all, true love is the greatest thing in the world...except for a nice M.L.T.--a mutton, lettuce, and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe.  They're so perky, I love that!  And you've gotta have a little dessert with it...after all, the chocolate makes it go down easier.\n\nAnyway, where was I?  Oh yes: watch this movie.  Don't give me excuses; just say \"as you wish\" and do it.  And if you have guests over, offer more than popcorn: make sure you ask if anybody wants a peanut.",

Bro how the fuck did they film that scene where the giant is climbing up the rope while carrying three other people around him? That looked insane. I wonder what illusion or trick they used to film that because it looked real. The set pieces are magical. They literally look like they came out of a fairy tale\u2026 which they have lol. \n\nThe fire swamp forrest was amazing. All the random spouts of fire that come from out of the ground.

And then Wesley gets the shit tackled out of him by one of them lmao. The Albino in the Pit of Despair was hilarious. The priest at the wedding was hilarious. \"Mawwige, mawwige is what bwings us togetha today\". Lmao. \n\nThis is a fantastic movie for kids because not only is it funny and entertaining, but it also teaches them about life and all the unfairness and pain that comes with it as we grow older and go through experiences through life. This movie's got a great sense of humor. A nice cozy, funny, entertaining film for the whole family. \n\n\nThis movie has a really great sense of humor. It's all so, inconceivable!

It takes ideas that have been used before in movies, but then tuns them into unique, original, and personal ideas. It's very charming and it doesn't take itself too seriously. \n\nThis movie takes the whole save the princess formula and then shatters it in thee best way possible.

Rob Reiner directed this wonderful film and it was written by William Goldman. The Princess Bride tackles issues like murder, kidnapping, torture, and death with a campy, comedic flair that never takes itself too seriously while still showing the virtues of friendship, love, and even hope in the face of despair. A family friendly film that is enjoyable for all ages. Billy Crystal and Carol Kane are completely delightful and have a wonderful chemistry on film.\n    The iconic sword-fight between Elwes and Patinkin was quite clever and very entertaining. Released in 1987, so the special effects and animatronics aren't up to part with today's standards, but they did quite well with the tools they had then. My only complaint is that although Elwes and Wright were great in their acting, they lacked any on-screen chemistry, fortunately their paired scenes were infrequent.

I was also watching it with other people and if you don't have the patience for it you might not be in on the joke in the first act of this delightfully post modern fairy tale that takes every opportunity it gets to satirise and poke fun at fantasy and fairy-tale cliches. This doesn't mean necessarily that the fairy tale itself isn't entertaining. I can say with pleasure though, that it is just as delightful, quirky, and witty as it was every other time I watched it as a child and everyone else seemed to be enjoying it also. \n\nThe narrative of The Princess Bride is hard to say immediately, taking after Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, it takes the opportunity of a fantasy tale being told to then comment on the genre of fantasy itself. A character credited just as 'The Grandson' is sick, and 'The Grandfather', affectionately played by Peter Falk, (Columbo, A Woman Under the Influence), reads him a book passed down through his family's generation like Pulp Fiction's gold watch, just with less ass-hiding and Christopher Walken. It tales the tale of Buttercup, who after her dear Wesley, (played with a lot of wit and fun by Cary Elwes, best known otherwise for Robin Hood: Men in Tights, and, well, Saw), dies, is married off to Prince Humperdinck. \n\nThis film works on a fair few levels, if you're a kid, you indentify with the figure of The Grandson, who is so perfectly written to encapsulate the young boy who pretends not to like 'kissing stories' but can't help but be absorbed by a really good one, and that this is. A really good story with aspects to attract all audiences, that's another level it works on as just a fantastic narrative, and then it works on a post-modern commentary in the same way that director Rob Reiner's This Is Spinal Tap is a post-modern commentary on the rock-doc and cock-rock metal music in general. The sets do look a bit setish but in a way that's part of the kitch charm this film holds, and who knows, with a film like this it might be on purpose.\n\nNow those who read my Escape from New York review might recall me saying that it might not be excusable to look cheap and claim post-modernism, but there's a difference between that and looking cheap on purpose. In the case of The Princess Bride it's a case of whether you find that charming or irritating, and who knows, it might not even be a thing that the film's doing. \n\nThe film is aided by a wonderfully fun cast that fill out an eclectic mix of entertaining and occasionally slightly anachronistic characters. The names include leading lady Robin Wright, (Forrest Gump, House of Cards), Chris Sarandon, (The Nightmare Before Christmas), Christopher Guest, (This Is Spinal Tap, A Few Good Men), Wallace Shawn, (Toy Story, Clueless), Mandy Pitinkin, (Homeland), Mel Smith, (Father Christmas, National Lampoon's European Vacation), Carol Kane, (Dog Day Afternoon, Annie Hall), Billy Crystal, (Monsters, Inc., When Harry Met Sally...), and the late, great, Andre The Giant. Some of the characters only showing up for seconds at a time but doing their bit with gusto and verve. \n\nThis film is a delight for all the family, and if you haven't seen it you had the wrong parents. I'm honestly really struggling to think of flaws, I'm sure it has them but the fact I didn't notice them really speaks a testament to the film.",

The Princess Bride starring: Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, and Mandy Patinkin, speaks of a quest for love and the battle to obtain it. Princess Buttercup (played by Robin Wright) falls in love with a farm boy named Wesley (Cary Elwes). Wesley soon sails off to find a job in order to pay for their marriage, however he would never make it to find a job. After Wesleys death the war seeking Prince Humperdink makes Buttercup his bride-to-be. Buttercup gets kidnapped by a genius named Vizzini, a master swordsman named Inigo, and a giant named Fezzik. Buttercup's kidnappers are followed by a stranger, and after they are defeated the stranger reveals himself. Afterwards the action begins to pick up and the quest for love truly begins. The movie keeps the story going, and the characters have strong morals that drive them to the end. It tells a good story, and presents challenges to overcome that are eventually solved. The special effects of the R.O.U.S's (Rodents Of Unusual Size) were clunky. Although as fezzik was climbing up the cliffs of insanity scene was suspenseful, and the way it was made was cool, Vizzini could have been a little easier on Fezzik. Overall I would give the movie 4 out of 5 stars, and recommend this movie to all audiences!",

It's such a classic today for a good reason.\nBased on the novel of the same name and in the perspective of a grandfather reading it to his grandson, The Princess Bride follows Princess Buttercup and her love for the poor but perfectly heroic farmhand Westley, as conflicting marriage from a villainous prince gets in the way of their blossoming love. We also see some great interactions from Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya, a expert swordsman hellbent on killing the murderer of his father, and Andre the Giant as the gentle giant Fezzik - Wallace Shawn, albeit a short performance, is inconcievably hilarious in his witty role.\nThe Princess Bride is, in a word, undeniably good spirited and enjoyable - it's hard to dislike it. Although it's predictable and a bit cliched, the story is compelling and adds bits of satire to the common fairytale hero scenario and doesn't disappoint. As I mentioned before, the performances are great. Both Elwes and Wright have great performances and chemistry, but Patinkin and Andre's more comedic duo approach is what steals the show. The characters are very likable and their performances are excellent. I think if anything that the film lacks in is the amount of comedy most fans hype about. What comedy that is in The Princess Bride is indeed clever, but not hilarious. It may just be a \"more you watch it\" type thing but the punchlines didn't deliver as much as I thought they would. Nonetheless, the constantly delivering atmosphere of The Princess Bride gives it a world of its own - a real timeless comedy adventure and one of Reiner's best works.",

The exchanges between the kid and his grandfather starts a little disconnected but develops wonderfully as the story moves on.

By staging an abduction and blaming the neighboring kingdom, he plans to woo his citizens to back his war. He uses the help of Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) the brains, Inigo Motoya (Mandy Patinkin) the steel and Fezzik (Andr\u00e9 the Giant) the muscle. When the dreaded pirate comes thwart his plan, it becomes personal. \n\nRob Reiner knows how to make a slapstick. Just like 'This is Spinal Tap', he doesn't go all out nasty - but picks the essential clich\u00e9s and use it to his advantage. But the movie is far from perfect due to relatively shortage of gags where it ebbs and tides between lull and hilarity. The thread between the grandfather and kid was so important for this movie to click as they interrupt the fairytale in the exact moments where it starts to become too much or too dull. The trio of the brains, steel and muscle were so perfect together and they produce some real entertainment. Cary Elwes was missing the quality that the rest of the cast had - natural comic timing and comes off as a weakling and makes it difficult to root for him. \n\nNot a Monty Python but definitely entertaining",

However, before the marriage, she is kidnapped by three eccentric, disproportionate pirates: Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), the leader; Fezzik (Andr\u00e9 the Giant), the clumsy, wisdom-speaking idiot; and Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), the wisest of the three.\n\nThen, like typical fairy tales, it poses the question that can be readily answered with a \"no\": is Westley actually dead? He, disguised in black, chases these three desperados to recover his lost love in a perilous hunt. During this exhausting journey to fight back for his love, we observe a good number of passionate kisses (hey, it's a romance) and hilariously scripted and well-choreographed duels (enough to make you forget of the horrific set pieces), though none are as frightening as the Forest and Westley's torture scenes as the undertakings are slightly painful and disturbing. But as we receive the assuring company of a grandfather narrating the story to us, it helps soothe the anxiety of the tale. But then again, an unexpected strong obscenity near the end is heard. However, due to its characteristic fairy tale formula, its virtues surely dwarfed the negative as it allowed the clear distinction between good and evil with the respective, evident deeds of each side shining.\n\nStill, this already colorful film is sprinkled by colorful subplots, like Inigo's father and revenge, fitting in perfectly and even aiding the story. Maybe Vizzini's famous \"inconceivable!\" may have been blown up by fans into one whole subplot itself already. As one of the few films I own, I rank this among my favorites. As the narrator in the trailer truthfully states, it's \"not just your basic, average, every day, ordinary, one-of-the-mill, ho-hum fairytale.\" Whether seeing this for the first or millionth time, with or without a loved one, The Princess Bride definitively lives up to all its \"inconceivableness.\"",

            "content": "The Princess Bride is a classic romantic comedy movie that is loved by most of its viewers, a movie that captures love, action, revenge, hatred, passion, adventure and comedy all in one. So many emotions are created in this movie that are portrayed to its viewers, and that is why it is a classic romantic comedy, however, what some people don't see behind this film is the hidden message of marriage and love. Yes, we all know that Buttercup and Wesley are meant for each other and their love is fantasized about by many teenage girls, but what message is it really portraying of love and of marriage? The creators of this movie are anti-marriage in my opinion because of the way that love and marriage is portrayed throughout the entire movie, Buttercup is powerless in both love situations and the man is powerful.\n\tIn the beginning of the movie, Buttercup and Wesley are madly in love and Wesley has to leave. While he is gone Buttercup gets word of his passing and becomes depressed, miserable and overwhelmed with emotion; this is when Prince Humperdinck comes into the picture and claims his love for her, a peasant of his country. He claims to be so madly in love with her that he wishes to marry her and Buttercup agrees to this.\n\tFirst of all, what is wrong with this picture? Do Princes always marry a peasant? If so, do teenage girls need to subject themselves to a specific class or group of people only to feel this kind of love? To marry a rich man and have all the things they could ever wish for, such as a nice car, mansion and servants? This thought is astounding. No, I am not a mother yet but I do not wish this desired love on any young man or woman; if it is even acceptable to call that love. This is showing people that it is ok to marry someone based on the possessions or land that they own or how much money they have, and not based on their feelings or personal virtue and morals.\n\tLater in the movie we find out that Prince Humperdinck wishes to marry Buttercup because she fits perfectly into his plan to start a war, and that is be killing her one night while on their honey moon. What does this message portray to the young men and woman who are watching this film? That you don't have to be in love with someone to marry them? I believe this is a great issue and has been the reason for many divorces that has ruined the lives of their children and other family members.\n\tPrince Humperdinck wasn't the only bad example of love in the film, but also is shown with the love between Buttercup and Wesley. Wesley comes back into Buttercups life and is still in love with her. He comes back to find her but only after he has become not only a part of the Dread Pirates Roberts, but Pirate Roberts himself, caption of the crew. While he was away he took control of the ship and learned how to fight and survive.\n In the film, it is portrayed that Wesley is deeply in love with Buttercup and wants her to run away with him. Is this a better option for Buttercup in reality? Buttercup loves him but what if she is on Wesley's ship one day and decides that she has had enough. She can't leave and suddenly go back to land. What is Wesley decides to force her to stay? She has no ability to fight with or without a sword like Wesley can. She would be considered a prisoner. Marriage or love should not be viewed as imprisonment. \nThe way that imprisonment in love is shown in this movie is also manipulating in a sense that it looks pleasing when Buttercup is with Wesley. The movie ends where Wesley and Buttercup ride off into the sunset, which we assume is back to Wesley's ship so they can get more money and live happily ever after. Is that the form of love that should be expected when young men or woman fall in love and want their love to be exactly like Wesley's and Buttercup's? The Princess Bride makes it look pleasant on the outside, but the meaning behind love and marriage in this movie is not one to be mimicked. \nIn my opinion, the creators of The Princess Bride are anti-marriage. They make imprisonment in love look like it is something that should be wished for, that the woman is powerless and the man is powerful, which is shown in both options of love that Buttercup has during the course of the movie.",

When it works, the sword fight between Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin for example, it really excels.  When it doesn't ... Billy Crystal, some of Andre the Giant's acting ... it just kind of lies there, but never for too long.  It sometimes feels to me like the film thinks its' absolutely hilarious, while maybe it's just pretty damn amusing.",

What I watched was The Princess Bride. It's not just amazing, it's unique and hilarious. Director Rob Reiner finally made a film useful for all ages. Reiner has brought author William Goldman's classic book to life in a great way.\n\nThe screenplay. written by Goldman himself is unforgettable and memorable. The story begins as a grandfather (Peter Falk), is reading a childhood classic book to his sick grandson. The book is called The Princess Bride, the same title as the film. It begins with a young woman named Buttercup (a stellar breakthrough performance by Robin Wright), who falls in love with her trusted farm boy named Wesley (Cary Elwes in his career best performance), who only says three little words when she assigns him a task: \"As you wish.\"\n\nAfter Wesley left on his ship, there were rumors of him killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Buttercup then reluctantly agrees to marry the evil Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), who she does not love.",

            "content": "The Princess Bride is one of those movies that, within a certain cultural milieu, one just isn't allowed to have a problem with.  Actually, I can't think of another movie that is sacrosanct as this one.  I will be the blasphemer here.  Don't get me wrong, there are some terrific elements, most famously the cameos.   I love Peter Cook's priest, and Billy Crystal is very funny.  Among the leads, Robin Wright is, for the most part, very good and sincere, and Mandy Patinkin is as fantastic as his reputation, embodying a level of sincerity and engagement which this film is unworthy of.   Thing is...there has always been something that rubbed me the wrong way about this movie, and I could never put my finger on it.   When a friend of mine who has a complete antipathy to fantasy and fairy tale remarked how much he loved it I finally understood:  it is a fairy tale for people who look down on fairy tales.  It is part and parcel of the phenomenon of the liberal bourgeoisie needing to be assured with a wink and a nod before allowing themselves to enjoy something in the traditional mold. The only things presented without ironic distance and affect are Matinkin's and Wright's acting and the lovely scenes with Peter Falk (just great here) and his grandson.  Everything else is post-modern to a fault, neatly deconstructed, the pretension of knowing distance a barrier to immersive engagement.  In some ways the movie really looks old, with some transparently bad sets and music, but generally it has a fine fairy tale look to it, especially the magical woodlands (Burnham Beeches, as with Robin Hood:  Prince of Thieves).  But the unreal presentation undermines the positive at every turn.  Watching this movie, it is hard to imagine that Cary Elwes is an actual actor. He mugs his way through this movie worse than any other star of a (non-Wes Anderson) film I can think of, and it is this knowing detachment that is most revealing about the movie.  Fairy tales are an eternally excellent literary form, they don't need to be poked at from a distance.  But just as conservatives need to be utterly certain they are righteous and patriotic, liberals need to be assured they are smart and knowing.  Even if it ruins a good fairy tale.",

            "content": "You can clearly see this is a Rob Reiner film in every sense. The whole production has that silly visual humour that most would associate with Mel Brooks...although not as strong. When the film came out it had moderate success and has since gone on to be become a bit of a cult, yet I'm not entirely sure why in all honesty.\n\nBased on a novel of the same name the story is the quintessential fairytale fable. A young dashing hero who was thought to be dead must save his true love from an evil Prince in his castle. There are sidekicks, magicians, evil henchmen, knights, places of peril and the odd oversized creatures.\n\nThe unique element in this rudimentary idea is the comedy factor, a combination of spoof and slapstick both verbally and visually. In short you could say this was an early live action version of the Shrek franchise but not as 'out there' with the fantasy. Every typical fairytale scenario has been slightly twisted and lampooned just enough to make it funny but not as an outright spoof. There is still a solid plot here despite the fact its predictable as hell. The other unique angle is the fact the whole film is being narrated by Columbo to Kevin Arnold in the real world, a story within a story, so you're never completely sure if things will pan out as you'd expect...(but they do).\n\nNow while I can't deny the film is a nice gentle old fashioned type of yarn it is extremely basic and largely unimpressive visually. I realise its more of a character piece than effects extravaganza but there really isn't much to soak up fantasy wise. It doesn't help me especially because some locations they filmed at the start, and the castle, are not far from my folks so it didn't give me any sense of wonder. There are some nice locations most definitely but it all looks too real if you get me, not much like a fantasy realm.\n\nThe film works mainly because of the characters, well some of them. Elwes is the perfect well spoken Flynn-esque hero without a doubt, he has good comedic timing and spoofs the classical silver screen hero very well. He virtually plays this character again in that Mel Brooks Robin Hood film. Wright is the perfect blonde fairytale Princess, utterly stunning! Sarandon does the slimy evil Prince to a tee and for me the best of all was Wallace Shawn as the low down crafty 'Vizzini'. Such a shame that Shawn's character dies so early on as he's the best thing going on in the film laughs wise. There are various other famous names in here too but for me they felt forced. Peter Cook's silly clergyman lisp just fell flat on its face, Mel Smith's Albino dungeon keeper felt out of place and not particularly funny whilst Billy Crystal was clearly Billy Crystal in makeup and not in the slightest bit amusing.\n\nHad this come out now I don't think it would do too well, or any better than it did back in 87. The whole idea has been done and drained by a certain green orge plus other animated flicks. Back in the day the idea of a spoof fantasy was a bit more original but even then it didn't fare that well and I'm not really surprised. I can see how this might not have appeared very enticing to cinema goers at the time.\n\nThere is little to no violence so its perfect for the younger viewer whilst adults can enjoy the soft satire. Even though this is the epitome of a true fairytale I can't really say its a rich magical experience because there isn't much of that going on. Its a pleasant cozy ride that will relax you and not put any pressure on the brain. A pure organic tale but also rather underwhelming.\n\n'Inconceivable!!'",

Every role is practically a career defining one. Though as often is the case, the title role is the least interesting one, with Robin Wright's Buttercup remaining terribly bland throughout.\nThe Princess Bride is, and always will be, my favourite movie of all time.

            "content": "THE PRINCESS BRIDE is one of those movies that is revered by Gen-X-ers and 80's babies, along with THE GOONIES and other children's films that have a certain adventurousness and whimsy to them. I, however, was born at the tail end of the decade, and missed out on a lot of these cinematic treasures as a child. Finally, I have rectified that by watching this film, which is firmly ingrained in the pop culture consciousness. Does it live up to the hype? Yes and no. From a filmic perspective, the narrative is a bit formulaic and clich\u00e9, like the storybook tales that this movie takes its inspiration from. On the other hand, there are plenty of moments of pure genius that make it stand out from the rest. Fortunately, the latter outweighs the former and overall it was a perfectly enjoyable viewing experience.\n\tThe story, although about the titular Princess Bride, is actually framed by a grandfather reading a book to his sick grandson. I think that this part is essential to making the film work because it gives the audience a way to understand the story and how it works on more than just a surface level. Fred Savage's character is the audience stand-in and his questions and commentary can represent the questions of all little boys who have been told fantastical stories by their own relatives. The grandfather can represent the director, or any family member who has served a storytelling role, and guides the audience through this familiar, yet not too familiar tale. The story of the Princess Bride itself is reminiscent of many a fairy tale, and like many before it tells how true love overcomes great obstacles. There is a great cast of characters, many serving up some choice and memorable dialogue that has gone down in the pantheon of great quotes. My personal favorites were from Vizzini, Inigo Montoya and the Impressive Clergyman.\n\tIn terms of quality, Rob Reiner did a great job directing his actors, who all give great performances. Even Robin Wright does an impressive job for her first big-screen role which, aside from Jenny in FORREST GUMP, is the role she is best known for playing. The filming aspect was also quite well done, with most of it being done on well-constructed and detailed studio sets. The cinematography, while not particularly memorable or flashy, was competent in workmanlike kind of way. The real weakness here is the script which, while serving up plenty of individual moments worthy of praise, didn't always flow naturally, and not because of the framing story either. There is also a long stretch of the movie where Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) and Fezzik (Andre the Giant) disappear, which just seemed odd to me. In my opinion, the story could have been fleshed out a little more in some respects. Still, what is there works for the most part, and I can't really fault it for trying to mix things up a bit.\n\tOverall, THE PRINCESS BRIDE is a perfectly enjoyable movie, even if it doesn't live up to the enormous praise heaped upon it. The movie does have some flaws, but those are mild in comparison to the great storytelling on display and great dialogue, which enhance its replay value. Highly recommended, especially if you haven't seen it yet.",

            "content": "Not quite a straight-laced fairy tale, and not quite a satire on straight-laced fairy tales, The Princess Bride is a perfectly timed and timeless take on the fairy tale structure, functioning as a substantial response to the lack of great medieval movies in the 1980s without feeling beholden to the decade. Even Fred Savage, who plays the boy hearing the story that is The Princess Bride, throws little to no contemporary lingo, allowing us to enjoy watching his character grow as the fantastical story unfolds. The plot itself is very accessible and familiar: Westley (Cary Elwes) and Buttercup (Robin Wright) are forever in love, Westley is forced to fight for his kingdom and is later presumed dead, and Buttercup can never fall in love again. Five years later, Buttercup is now the soon-to-be wife to the devilishly suave Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), and Westley finally returns in time to save Buttercup from abduction, assassination, and arranged marriage. In a sub-plot, three low-class marauders Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), Fezzik (Andre the Giant, perhaps the best on-screen performance from any professional wrestler ever), and Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) are looking to make ends meet through petty theft and hostage situations. Inigo has a greater ambition, however. The most famous quote from the movie sums up his motive economically. When he confronts Count Rugen (Christopher Guest), he will say, \"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\" I suspect that such an expositional quote was so memorable for everyone was because of its presentation and context. This character has no more to say to the Count, other than those words. Inigo doesn't even prove himself to be that threatening, before inevitably confronting the Count. That's what people love about heroes though. Their persistence is far more admirable than their track record, so when they drop a line like that, your attention is dead set on what will happen next. Director Rob Reiner and screenwriter/author William Goldman followed that with one of the movie's best jokes, ensuring the audience that this is all in good jest.\n\nThat's something that I wish more filmmakers would try -- to present a straightforward tale and advance it through comedy. Most movies rely on more common tropes, like the comic relief. Now thinking about the characters in The Princess Bride, there weren't any obvious comic relief characters. Andre the Giant comes closest to that, but he is still portrayed as a key member of the group of heroes. All of the characters are borderline plot devices, but I don't want to call that a weakness to the film's credit. It was a choice, and in the experience of watching the movie, I did not care that everyone wore their motives on their sleeves. The fact that they did opened me to appreciating other elements of the movie, like the economy of the fight scenes or the brilliance in the more subtle jokes in debt to both William Goldman and the cast. [I wish that I had written this review immediately after I watched the movie, so I could think of a good example.] I'm not much of a family-friendly guy, but I should note that this really is for all ages. In a time when Spielberg was the new inspiration children's film director, Rob Reiner thankfully forewent some of the shlocky traits of E.T. and used the relationship between Fred Savage and his grandfather (Peter Falk) in order for kids to better engage themselves. I don't think of The Princess Bride as a children's movie though. I can see many of the jokes going over kids' heads. That's okay! I believe this movie is worth watching at any age. There may not always be something new to discover, but substance is abound.",

The Princess Bride is a genre-defining film that has endured the test of time beautifully and still stands as one of the best adventure films and the one film you should see if you're interested in swashbuckler films.\n\nWhat I like the most about this film is its unpredictability. Sure, it's an adventure film aimed for all audiences, so the good guys are going to win and all that, but the way they go about accomplishing that task is what makes this film enjoyable. You're never sure what's going to happen next, the characters are very creative and there are a lot of them, the plot twists come right out of nowhere and the humorous tongue-in-cheek tone ties it all together. There is drama and high stages, yes, but it's still an adventure film and meant to be enjoyed with a smile on your face.\n\nThe story develops rather erratically, going from one scene to another with very few tie-ins, but in this case it works, because the whole film is told more like a fairy tale than a typical story. So it's more of a preference of style than a flaw.\n\nIf I were to nitpick, I'd say that the frame story involving a grandfather reading his grandson a book while he lies sick in bed is not as interesting as the actual story and sometimes the kid's interruptions in the story come at the worst possible times. This is only a nitpick, however, because the banter between these two is actually quite humorous, which keeps it from becoming an annoyance. It'd be interesting to see just how well the actual adventure would flow without the frame story, just for comparison.\n\nI like this film, I like a lot. It has a strong story, it's fun and charming without being immature, its characters are great, it has a lot of memorable dialogues and as a whole it's just bursting with imagination.

            "content": "In the 1980's, most fantasy films were, with few exceptions, not particularly good at all, with most bordering on distasteful territory (I'm looking at you, THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER and DEATHSTALKER).  Rob Reiner's alternatingly romantic, humorous fairy tale, THE PRINCESS BRIDE, luckily, was one of the exceptions of this period.  Not the least bit afraid to acknowledge its simplistic origins, this potentially sappy love story (about a farm girl betrothed to a wicked prince and her true love coming to the rescue) sprinkles bits of comedy throughout its 98 minute running time.  Even the leads, Westley (a dashing Cary Elwes) and Buttercup (yes, that's her name, played by Robyn Wright) are given humorous lines to distinguish them from the usual stock couple.  There are a few bits of violence and at least one scary scene involving a struggle with a monstrous \"rodent of unusual size\", but the overall tone of the film is one of playfulness and heart.  There are even memorably showstealing turns by the likes of Mandy Patinkin as a Spanish swordsman seeking vengeance, the late Andre the Giant, Chris Sarandon as the smarmy, treacherous Prince Humperdinck, and Billy Crystal as a disgraced magician.  Incidentally, the whole story is told by a well-cast Peter Falk as the grandfather of a sickly, cynical boy, who occasionally interrupts the story, mostly with qualms over the kissing scenes.  A box office disappointment in its 1987 release, THE PRINCESS BRIDE has since acquired a cult following, and deservedly so.  This is a family classic that I highly recommend; there's plenty for young and old alike to enjoy.",

            "content": "It's kind of like the original \"Ever After\", only sillier, which I know is hard to believe, considering that Drew Barrymore's English accent was bonkers enough. Of course, it's still not quite as silly... or as boringly monotonous, aimless, plotless, obnoxious, unfunny, bad and altogether overrated as \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\". Yes, people, I said it, and I say tough luck if \"you can't handle the truth\", unless, of course, you happen to be \"standing by me\", ready to give me some \"misery\" for my tastes, because I haven't finished my \"bucket list\". Yeah, I'm kind of surprised that this rom-com adventure is being taken on by Rob Reiner, seeing as how he had not yet met something like \"When Harry Met Sally...\", though I'm glad that they got good ol' Meathead in the end, as he made this film an entertaining one, even though it does have some disappointments. I don't know about y'all, but I kept expecting this young boy's grandfather to torture the kid in bed as part of his bucket list, before being tried for either the murder of a black man in the '60s or some dude in the Marines, while the boy escapes to find a dead body during a coming-of-age adventure. Bad jokes aside, Rob Reiner is evidently quite the diverse director, and a pretty decent one at that, as he knows how to make some enjoyable films, including this one. Of course, some stories are bittersweet, and sure enough, it's only a matter of time before this delightful tale dips \"North\"-I mean, south (Does anyone remember or at least want to remember that Rob Reiner film?).\r\n\r\nPresented as a dramatisation of a storybook being read by a man to his sickly grandson, this film's titular primary story takes over the narrative and often flows along narratively uninfluenced by its frame story, and yet, as primarily focused upon what the frame story focuses upon as this film is, there come occasions in which a kind of storybook type of storytelling sloppily taints, if not interrupts the primary narrative. The moments in which the frame story comes back into play and claims total focus from the central plot are far and few between, yet they do occur and slow down the momentum of the titular central plot tremendously, while a combination of such things as the immense gratuitousness of the frame story's ensuing and the disconcerting unlikability of a young Fred Savage's obnoxious child character, to whom this story is told, all-out halt the central plot's momentum all together, thus throwing you off disengangingly, which is ironic, considering that what usually disengages in this film is momentum's doing anything but slowing down. Whether it be because of it's being presented in the frame story as a usually heavy-handed storybook or whatever, this film's central plot rarely slows down in structural pace, being not exactly exhaustingly hurried, but too heavy-handed in its plotting, or at least in its exposition, as the film's development value feels fairly thin. This film's lack of exposition doesn't disengage you totally from the story, yet expository issues soften your grip on the story a fair bit, and it doesn't help that the body of the story is also hurried, thrusting along with limited slow-down, only too much focus upon set pieces. There's not too much actual flow to this film, as it goes driven by set pieces that do indeed entertain, but get to be repetitious as key plot elements, rather than relief between key plot elements. Now, I'm not asking for a whole lot of depth out of this film, yet set piece storytelling comes with many a natural shortcoming, from the aforementioned repetition to a kind of focal unevenness that keeps you from gripping certain points in the story as much as you probably should, thus making for a film that is certainly underwhelming, and could be forgettable high entertainment value. Well, sure enough, while this film is much too lacking in substance to keep you all that invested in the thin, uneven and heavy-handed plot, memorable charm is undeniable and thorough, as sure as nifty production value is consistent.\r\n\r\nSet on a minimalist scale, with little focus on actual production value, this film isn't exactly upstanding in its production designs, yet Norman Garwood's efforts are commendable, as are the efforts of costume designer Phyllis Dalton, delivering on nifty designs that don't exactly sell you on the central plot's Renaissance era tremendously, but certainly convince enough for you to find a reasonably firm grip on setting, while visual style gives you a reasonable grip on artistry. Like the production and costume designs, neither Richard Holland's and Keith Pain's art direction nor Adrian Biddle's cinematography is especially upstanding, yet the film's artistry remains handsome, capturing the colorful majesty of the setting with grace, while Biddle's photography boasts decent definition to coloring and lighting that, upon being presented with a handsome environment and, by extension, strong opportunity for particularly lovely visual style, strikes with a fair degree of attractive sharpness. I do kind of wish that more production and stylistic dazzle had gone into this film, even though it doesn't require a whole lot of technical competence, but in the long run, but the film is still fairly nifty as a technical and stylistic piece, though one that really only focuses upon its technicality as not much more than a supplement to entertainment value, which goes driven by humor that requires quite a bit of effectiveness to power this film that is perhaps too reliant on its colorful set pieces. Well, sure enough, while the humor's usage as a key storytelling element leads to natural shortcomings, you'd be hard pressed to be all that disengaged by the film, as the humor that drives it is nothing short of consistently effective, with witty satire and dialogue and set pieces that range from cleverly amusing to downright borderline, if not decidedly hilarious, partially thanks to the comic effectiveness of a hefty cast of charmers. The film doesn't put too much care in characterization, largely because this film is hardly driven by its character value, yet the characters engage through and through, not just because of the charm within what characterization there is within William Goldman's script, but because of relentless charm within this film's cast of delightfully colorful charismas, all of whom are distinct and memorable in their sharp comic delivery and colorful presence. The onscreen talents are consistently charismatic, driving the color that drives this film a long way, but really, when you get down to it, the performance that really needs to deliver on color is, of course, a certain offscreen one, whose charming effectiveness can make or break the memorability of this messy film, which is why director Rob Reiner steps up when it comes to entertainment value, being unable to battle back natural shortcomings, but keeping you thoroughly engaged by gracing atmosphere with his distinct livliness, which powers the final product a long way, or at least about as far as it can be powered. On a general filmmaking level, this film underwhelms, due to natural shortcomings and questionable storytelling styles, but as a fluff piece, the final product delivers, being thorough in colorful charm, effective humor and all around entertainment value, and ultimately memorable as a fun little tale, even if it's not much more than that.\r\n\r\nTo conclude this tale, the frame story's influence on storytelling gets to be problematic, though not quite as much as fluffiness influence on storytelling, whose exposition and fluidity go diluted by too much focus upon set pieces as repetitious and aimless plotting elements, thus making for a naturally flawed film that is unable to escape underwhelmingness on a general filmmaking scale, even though it delivers as an entertainment piece, with handsome production designs and artistry to compliment Rob Reiner's lively atmosphere, powered by William Goldman's fun and funny script, and a richly colorful and diverse cast of charismas who help greatly in making \"The Princess Bride\" a consistently entertaining satire, even with its disengaging natural shortcomings.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

            "content": "It struck me as a combination of 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and Rob Reiner's own 'This is Spinal Tap'. While it has moments of laugh-out-loud slapstick humor like the former, also tries to invest a story of its own no matter how clich\u00e9d the characters or storyline is (of course it was intentional) as the latter. The exchanges between the kid and his grandfather starts a little disconnected but develops wonderfully as the story moves on. But Cary Elwes was the weak point as he neither has the comic timing nor the persona to pull this off.\r\n\r\nThe bride (Robin Wright) falls in love with her farm boy Westley (Cary Elwes). When Westley heads out to the world to make a living, the news of his death in the hands of a dreaded pirate devastates the bride. An egotistic and scheming Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) betroths her to hatch an evil plot. By staging an abduction and blaming the neighboring kingdom, he plans to woo his citizens to back his war. He uses the help of Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) the brains, Inigo Motoya (Mandy Patinkin) the steel and Fezzik (Andr\u00e9 the Giant) the muscle. When the dreaded pirate comes thwart his plan, it becomes personal.\r\n\r\nRob Reiner knows how to make a slapstick. Just like 'This is Spinal Tap', he doesn't go all out nasty - but picks the essential clich\u00e9s and use it to his advantage. But the movie is far from perfect due to relatively shortage of gags where it ebbs and tides between lull and hilarity. The thread between the grandfather and kid was so important for this movie to click as they interrupt the fairytale in the exact moments where it starts to become too much or too dull. The trio of the brains, steel and muscle were so perfect together and they produce some real entertainment. Cary Elwes was missing the quality that the rest of the cast had - natural comic timing and comes off as a weakling and makes it difficult to root for him. \r\n\r\nNot a Monty Python but definitely entertaining",

            "content": "I have to admit I fell in love with this film the first time I saw it on TV back in the nineties. It just occurred to me when I pulled out the DVD to give it a viewing today that it was released 25 years ago (almost to the day!). Certain of my friends will give me some stick for liking this \u00e2chick flick\u00e2?, (their words, not mine) but they\u00e2(TM)ve never seen what I see in it; much to their loss I might add. But enough of my prattling on, here\u00e2(TM)s a brief summary before I tell you just why I love this film so much.\n\nThe story is told by a grandfather to his grandson who is sick in bed; as he explains, \u00e2When I was your age, television was called books.\u00e2? He tells the boy that this is a very special book that has been passed down through the generations. Having allayed his fears about the amount of kissing; he begins. The story concerns a girl, Buttercup, who falls in love with a farm boy, Westley. He leaves to seek his fortune but his ship is attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts and, as everyone knows, the Dread Pirate Roberts doesn\u00e2(TM)t take prisoners. Buttercup is devastated and becomes numb to the world. Years later we find she is betrothed to Prince Humperdinck; but she will only ever have one true love (sorry, that part\u00e2(TM)s a tad soppy). She is out riding one day when she is kidnapped by an evil genius, Vizzini, a giant, Fezzik and an expert swordsman, Inigo Montoya. They set off towards the neighbouring kingdom of Guilder but soon find they are being pursued by a masked man\u00e2\u00a6 There is much more to tell but I\u00e2(TM)m going to leave it here with you wondering just who this masked stranger could be.\n\nReally well made with one or two dodgy amamatronics, but I\u00e2(TM)ll forgive that given its vintage. A great score by Mark Knopfler complements the film without overpowering it at all; in fact it wasn\u00e2(TM)t until we were well into it that I noted that the music sounded kinda familiar. Great performances all round; of particular note were; Cary Elwes as Westley, Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya, Chris Sarandon as Prince Humperdinck, Christopher Guest as Count Tyrone Rugen, Wallace Shawn as Vizzini, Andr\u00c3 (C) the Giant as Fezzik and introducing Robin Wright as The Princess Bride. I also have to give honourable mentions to; Fred Savage as The Grandson, Peter Falk as The Grandfather/Narrator, Peter Cook as The Impressive Clergyman, Mel Smith as The Albino, Carol Kane as Valerie and finally Billy Crystal as Miracle Max.\n\nSo why do I love this film so much? Well, for me it has everything; pirates, a giant, great swordplay, a damsel in distress, an evil bad guy, revenge, an awful lot of humour and not least a happy ending. There is quite a modern feel to it all but with the traditional values of chivalry along with a little dastardly play. Of course, some magic; how could you have a fairytale without magic? But over all, I love it because it doesn\u00e2(TM)t pretend to be anything more or less than it is; a great adventure. If I ever need cheering up or I need to restore my faith in human nature I can escape into this film and when I come out the other side I know I\u00e2(TM)ll feel better. No, it\u00e2(TM)s not perfect, but I\u00e2(TM)d watch it in preference to many modern films any day.\n\nSteelMonster\u00e2(TM)s verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nMy score: 8.9/10",

            "content": "\"The Princess Bride\" is simply one of the greatest comedies in the world.  Even though it has a strong cult following, I don't consider it to be a cult classic.  It isn't the type of film that you had to see as a child or had to see with a particular group of people for it to have a magical effect each time that you watch - any person can watch this for the first time at any point in their life and immediately find themself quoting it.  In fact, it is arguably the most quotable film in the world, from \"As you wish\" to \"Inconceivable\" and \"Anybody want a peanut?\"  How many weddings on television and in real life have involved the words \"Mawwiage is what bwings us togethah today\"?  This is not just a film - it is a part of our culture.  The majority of the credit belongs to William Goldman for writing such a humorous script equally filled with heartwarming moments and absurdity.  The dialogue flows without ever letting the movie get boring.  I love the storytelling technique (particularly because it involves Peter Falk as Grandfather), but you derive a certain comic element by having all of the \"kissing parts\" be interrupted by Fred Savage.  The only problem is that it really does prevent you from having an emotional moment with the strategic interruptions, but the humor is probably more valuable than the chick-flick-effect.  The casting department also deserves a great deal of credit for bringing in big names for this family film and finding a perfect fit for each character.  But really, this film comes down to incredible acting, spot-on interpretation of characters, and memorable delivery of lines.  I am going to skip past all of the lead actors and go straight to Wallace Shawn, who gives the performance of a lifetime.  He is absolutely hysterical as Vizzini, the high strung Sicilian with a superior intellect.  His voice and facial expressions make this one of my favorite characters in all of cinema.  Carey Elwes and Robin Wright have excellent chemistry together, even though they are in a limited number of scenes, but it is enough that we want to see them together.  Chris Sarandon brings a great scheming side to Humperdinck, showing that he really is smart but has a dark side that we hate, and who could forget Mandy Patinkin's signature line that keeps appearing throughout the movie.  Andre the Giant's dialogue is really difficult to understand but let's face it, it's Andre the Giant and that's awesome.  Perhaps the greatest surprise of the entire movie is Billy Crystal and Carol Kane, unrecognizably done up in make-up as Miracle Max and his wife.  These characters may only have 5 minutes of screen time, but the vocal intonation and sass of these two classic comedic actors is the icing on the cake.  From its creative atmospheres like the Cliffs of Insanity and the Fire Swamp to its quotable dialogue and dynamic characters, \"The Princess Bride\" is a laugh-out-loud love story that can be enjoyed by audiences of any age and is one of our generation's first classic films to pass on to our children.",

        {
            "content": "The trick to making a really great spoof or satire is that the story should still work on its own terms and feel integral, even if its main purpose is to make jokes about other stories. Airplane! and Naked Gun both work because even in their wildest and most outlandish moments, they are grounded in something which is even faintly plausible. This is more difficult in the fantasy genre because it is easy to just invent your way out of a situation and pass it off as magic that you don't have to explain.\n\nComparing The Princess Bride to the Zucker Brothers is difficult because, unlike Airplane!, it was never envisioned as a straight-up comedy. Rob Reiner's adaptation of William Goldman's novel is attempting to have its cake and eat it, poking fun at all the silly aspects of fantasy fiction and filmmaking while also demonstrating its love and affection for those kinds of stories. Whether as a comedy or a sweet-natured love story, it is simultaneously a heart-warming triumph and a slight disappointment.\n\nAll of the problems with The Princess Bride result from the fact that it is never entirely consistent as to how far it is departing from convention as opposed to celebrating it or playing it with a straight face. According to the making-of documentary, Reiner instructed his actors to treat their roles like they were playing cards, almost but never entirely revealing what they had in their hand. The film keeps teasing us as to the cards that it holds, leaving us with the feeling that it would have been a more generally appealing film if it had chosen to go one way or the other.\n\nReiner's three previous directorial efforts suggest that he was the perfect man to take on Goldman's multi-genre work. He had done justice to Stephen King's distinctive characters in Stand By Me, sensitively handled young love in The Sure Thing, and created a comedy monolith for the ages in the cult classic This Is Spinal Tap. But while the characters are memorable and funny, they don't always deviate from their moulds in the way that they do in, for instance, When Harry Met Sally. Princess Buttercup may be headstrong and combative, but she's still a straight-up damsel-in-distress, with Robin Wright getting relatively little to work with.\n\nThe sad thing about this is that if The Princess Bride had been played completely straight, as an ordinary fairy tale, it would have still been pretty good. We really believe in the relationship between Wesley and Buttercup because the chemistry between Wright and Cary Elwes is so terrifically convincing. We like them so much that we would be willing for the film to embrace convention, since their relationship is enough to make it memorable. But when other aspects of the story break from the mould so deliberately, you feel disappointed that the whole film couldn't live up to those standards, and that turns these accepted conventions into unwanted clich\u00e9s.\n\nSpeaking of clich\u00e9s, much of the comedy in The Princess Bride hasn't dated very well. All the lines that are quoted by fans still retain their power, whether it's Inigo Montoya's speech to the six-fingered man, or Peter Cook's musings on \"mawwiage\". But Billy Crystal's comic interlude as Miracle Max brings the story to a grinding halt from which it never fully recovers. His Yiddish shtick feels more suited to a sub-par Mel Brooks film, and even with Crystal's great comic timing it doesn't gel with everything around it.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many moments in The Princess Bride which are still either wittily self-referential or laugh-out-loud funny. The best examples of the former both involve the Dread Pirate Roberts, first in his epic swordfight with Inigo Montoya and then his battle of wits with Vizzini. In both cases there is a self-awareness to the scenes, with Montoya quipping about the different sword-fighting techniques being used and oddities associated with the notion of fair play. As for Vizzini, he treats us to Hegelian dialectics and the writings of Field Marshal Montgomery while doing comedy acrobats, setting us up beautifully for a funny death and Roberts' punch line.\n\nThe conversations between the son (Fred Savage) and his grandfather (Peter Falk) also fall into this category of poking fun at these traditions as they are acted out in beautiful detail. They have arguments about why certain things have to happen in order for the story to make sense - or why kissing shouldn't be allowed in these stories. But unlike subsequent spoofs like Austin Powers, where the characters deliberately talk about the absurdity of their plans, in The Princess Bride all of these conversations feel naturalistic. The film is not just making a joke, it's making a point about the evolutions that stories undergo to match our changing expectations.\n\nIn the documentary, Reiner and actor Chris Sarandon talked about The Princess Bride as a testament to the importance of storytelling. The film gently illuminates the way that fairy tales carry moral lessons, which are conveyed in a certain visual or narrative language to help us understand the world around us. There are familiar lessons about following one's heart, bad deeds coming back to haunt you and good ultimately triumphing over evil, which are conveyed in a non-patronising way for children while reminding adults of the stories they grew up with.\n\nThere is also an interesting idea, which isn't explored in enough detail, about the transferring of character identity. Peter Falk's dialogue about The Princess Bride (that would read to him by his father) is mirrored by Wesley's conversation about taking on the mantle of the Dread Pirate Roberts. There is a hint in the closing words, \"as you wish\" that Falk and Wesley may have some kind of connection, with the real world and story world overlapping. With both characters there is the theme of different people keeping the same characters alive, like different actors playing James Bond, Sherlock Holmes or Doctor Who.\n\nThe Princess Bride is also notable for its fantastic swashbuckling. The fight scenes were choreographed by the late great Bob Anderson, who worked on the original Star Wars trilogy, Barry Lyndon and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Reiner wanted to pay tribute to the swashbuckling adventure movies of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Errol Flynn, the latter of whom was trained (and injured) by Anderson. The fights are shot in long, wide-angled takes so that we get a real sense of scale, and all the stunts bar two somersaults are done by the performers.\n\nThe performances in The Princess Bride are to a large extent the secret of its success. Cary Elwes is really good in his first starring role: he's charismatic, funny, looks the part of an action hero, and delivers his lines with a great sense of timing and wit. Christopher Guest, who worked with Reiner on Spinal Tap, makes the very most of all too small a part, playing on Prince Humperdinck's insecurities and having great fun during the torture scenes. Peter Cook's cameo may be very close to Michael Palin's Pontius Pilate in Life of Brian, but he's every bit as funny as Palin and looks more thrillingly ridiculous. And Mel Smith gets a very nice cameo as the albino assistant torturer, soothing Wesley after Count Rugen's torment.\n\nThe Princess Bride may not have aged all that well in certain aspects, nor is it quite as forthcoming in its satire as many would like. But its cult status is ensured thanks to a handful of very good performances, a solid central romance, a series of very funny moments and some great action scenes. In the grand scheme of 1980s fantasy it's on a par with Ladyhawke, at least as a love story. It's not Rob Reiner's finest hour, but it's still well worth a look.",

I think I saw a kitchen sink in Miracle Max's hut as his wife chases him around the room. This film's got everything! It is simply flawless from beginning to end. I can find no fault in this movie. I have watched it several times and every time it's a great ride with some of the most talented people who are at least really really good at pretending to have a good time telling a fun story. I like to imagine they're not pretending. This is the kind of film that warms the heart in the chill of December and cools it down in the heat of July. I would recommend this to anyone regardless of their demographic. If I ever had children, this would probably be the first film they'd ever see. If I ever learn I will die soon, this will probably be the last film I want to see before I die. I can't find words in my native tongue that properly convey to my fellow human beings how much I cherish and adore this film and wish everyone who has ever or will ever live would get to experience it and somehow appreciate it as much as I have. On rare occasion I have used the words \"as you wish\" to convey how much i love family members and friends in an unconditional matter of fact way. Sometimes they get it. Sometimes they don't. But that's not the point. My only criticism with this film is that Rob Reiner never got around to following it up with an equally awesome sequel whose name could only be The Dread Pirate Roberts. Perhaps some things are best left to the imagination of the viewer, but in my heart and mind these characters live forever just one strong wind ahead of adversity, and one horizon line towards their happily ever after.",

Well, out of boredom, I decided to watch the movie. It was a decent parody of the \"Save the Princess\" genre. Some of the humor is really funny, some is just passable. But there was only two or three laugh out loud moments.\n\nThe story is a classic fairy tale about two common young people, Westley and Buttercup. The two fall in love, but Westley must leave Buttercup. He promises to return, but never comes back. Years later the evil Prince Humperdinck plans to marry Buttercup. Buttercup does not love the Prince, but has to go along with his plan. Until one day, she is kidnapped by three men. The men are chased by a masked figure who turns out to be Westley. Westley is able to disable the three men and take back the princess. But now he must protect her from the evil Prince who wants her back.\n\nRobin Wright stars as Buttercup. This was her first role, I think, and she is very good. Towards the end of the movie she is basically resigned to saying, \"My Westley will save me.\" But overall she is good. Cary Elwes plays quite the Errol Flynn with Westley. Also look for Peter Falk as the Grandfather.\n\nOverall, it feels like it could have been more. The parody aspect of it could have been funnier. But the movie isn't bad, just not stand out good.\n\n\"You fell victim to one of the classic blunders! The most famous of which is \"never get involved in a land war in Asia,\" but only slightly less well-known is this: Never go in against a Sicilian when DEATH is on the line.\" 6.5/10",

            "content": "When I was a little Rebecca, I sang in the children's choir at church, less out of piety than hunger for a captive audience (these days it's less church choir and more Rocky Horror performances at the local gay club, but the basic principle is the same). There was an hour-long break between choir practice and the actual service, which choristers' parents were called upon in their turn to fill with movies and Timbits. One mom brought The Princess Bride (Rob Reiner, 1987) for us to watch every time her turn rolled around. It was like she didn't own any other movies (or maybe just none that were fit to be shown in church?). Anyhow, that's how I saw the first half of The Princess Bride about thirty times before I turned 13. Unfortunately, the hour-long break wasn't quite long enough to finish the movie, and for over a decade, I wondered whether the vengeful swordsman would finally find his six-fingered nemesis. A few weeks ago I caved and bought the DVD, and that six-fingered asshole finally got what was coming to him. Now at last I have peace (and a new review to do).\n\nPeasants Buttercup (Robin Wright) and Westley (Cary Elwes) are in love. (You know right away that they're in love because they're both so blonde and pretty. Either in love or siblings). Westley ventures off to seek their fortune and is unfortunately killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Meanwhile, Buttercup is summoned to wed the Prince of Florin, wicked Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), but the wedding is put on hold when she's kidnapped by brigands Vizzini (Wallace Shawn, short), Fezzik (Andre the Giant, tall), and Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin, Spanish). Buttercup is shortly rescued by none other than the Dread Pirate Roberts, who turns out to be Westley in disguise! Blissfully reunited, Westley and Buttercup fight some giant rats, get rid of her new fiance, and conquer death itself. It's all relatively smooth going and at last they ride away into the sunset (on white fucking horses no less).\n\nThe Princess Bride is adapted from a book by William Goldman, and as you might expect when Spinal Tap's director films a work by Marathon Man's screenwriter, the film never verges on sentimental or cloying despite its title and premise. It's eminently quotable high adventure that knows when to stick to fairy-tale conventions and when to send them packing. Also, it's not in the least dated -- sometimes 80s fantasy betrays itself through haircuts and makeup (Labyrinth, Ladyhawke), but the mise en scene here is Germanic medieval goodness all the way, which makes it doubly funny when the characters break their mythic shackles to comment with modern cynicism on their circumstances (\"never get involved in a land war in Asia\", Vizzini warns Westley grimly). The very best thing about this movie is that every performance is a standout. There's not a weak link in the bunch. Even Billy Crystal's cameo -- he's a withered gnome with a New Yawker accent -- somehow works (with emphasis on the somehow).\n\nI'm not so mired in nostalgia for The Princess Bride to ignore the fact that the film is decidedly uneven after Westley conquers Buttercup's captors. The half-hour showdown between pirate and brigands is such perfect movie-making that everything afterwards is a bit of a letdown. Still, the quality of the rest of the movie ranges from \"excellent\" to \"pretty good\", so I wouldn't call time spent watching it wasted.\n\nThe only other thing that irks me about The Princess Bride is its love story. Not because it's too sweet, which is a complaint I've heard. The opposite, in fact. When Westley shows up to rescue Buttercup, he's stolen the Dread Pirate Roberts' identity -- complete with Roberts' \"leave no man alive\" mission statement. That means that, for all intents and purposes, Westley returns to Buttercup a serial killer. This never bothers her or, apparently, anyone else. Westley is also just kind of a jerk to her: he continues to let her believe her beloved is dead much longer than he has to, insulting her fidelity long after she's demonstrated that her marriage to Humperdinck is a sham and she still loves her vanished fiance. I guess it's all meant to be a test of her loyalty or something, but it just comes off as dickish and kind of makes me wish Buttercup had gone off with Inigo Montoya instead.\n\nBe that as it may, I give a 4/5 to The Princess Bride. The waters of 80s fantasy can be treacherous (killer eels, don't you know) but Reiner navigates them successfully, and his gorgeous film is still enjoyable today.\n\nhttp://theblackcatreviews.blogspot.ca/",

This movie is nothing short of pure movie making magic and it shows it every single scene, from start to end. I have seen this movie so many times and just recently decided to buy it on DVD, a move which I believe is one of the best movie purchases I have ever made! =D So where to begin?\n\n~May contain spoilers ~\n\nWe all know movies based on books have the ability to go big or flop... this one went nuclear. 'The Princess Bride' tells a story of love, trust, honor, family, evil, and success to name but a few of my favorite motifs. When a movie is as good as this one I am truly unsure of where to comment or to review. I suppose my usual set up will be utilized but instead of bad-good-best we will just go \"Yeah. Yeah? YEAH!\"\n\nYeah.\n-Yeah the movie was made in 1987 and some of the scenes are silly and obviously fake, but just imagine seeing it for the first time in 1987. This would feel like Cloud 9.\n-Yeah some of the lines are cheesy and some of the action sequences feel a bit awkward, but that's what makes anything older than my age priceless. <3  \n-Yeah this movie has got a lot of acclaim and it deserves every bit of it.\n\nYeah? \n-Really this cast is almost all unknown and this movie rocked that well? I mean that's just amazing in itself, let alone in this particular movie. \n-Yeah? this genre of movie can't support the type of fun this movie has? Really? Because for 1 hour 38 minutes I am fully content with what is going on and am absolutely in love with the movie. \n-Yeah it's true, just about anybody can pick this movie up and watch it. It's that good.\n\nYEAH!\n-The story line.\n-THE ACTORS!\n-That unforgettable plot line. \nThis movie has gone down in my history books as one of the best ever made, ever acted, every scripted, and ever done... ever. This movie keeps me coming back for more, looking for different things that i didn't pick up on the previous watch and memorize more quotes from this Goliath of a movie. \n\nDo yourself the favor and watch this movie. I promise you will not regret it, will not forget it and will find yourself running around saying:\n\n\"HALLO! My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\"\n\n5 \"as you wish\" stars out of 5.",

It's odd because the movie is so simple and sweet, and yet it manages to succeed on every front.  It is simultaneously a beautiful love story, a swashbuckling adventure, and a hilarious comedy. In fact if I were to make any criticism of the film it would simply be that the advertisers botched the job so much that it managed to fly under the radar and most people missed it in the theater (I was lucky enough to catch it on the big screen years later on a retro movie night at our local theater.)\n\nAs you can see I'm completely enamored with this movie, so you'll have to forgive me as I exhaust the entire thesaurus of positive adjectives when describing the different aspects of the movie.  For starters there is the brilliant cast. Each and every role seems to have been written specifically for the actor who was cast. I could list so many, from Mandy Patinkin to Billy Crystal, each person is amazing. The story is top notch as well. It is great how they frame the whole fairy tale in the context of a grandfather reading to his grandson. And the fairy tale has just the right amount of fantastical elements to make it interesting but not ridiculous. \n\nBut, as I said near the beginning, there are really 3 superb movies all wrapped in this 1. First there is the love story. It is the kind of romantic love story that is so perfect you almost have to admit that it could only exist in a fairy tale. Next there is this action and adventure. The sword fights are amazing (some of the best I've ever seen.) Plus, the resolution of Inigo's story is possibly one of the most satisfying moments I have ever seen. Finally, and perhaps above all, there is so much comedy in this film. Every other line is practically a laugh-out-loud moment. And not just once, but after watching the film dozens of times they still make me laugh. I should stop here, because what more can I say? The Princess Bride is a stupendous masterpiece that has been and will always be one of my favorite films of all time.",

The films flows flawlessly from action-packed sword fights and hand to hand duels with giants to intimate reunions between lovers lost to hilarious battles of the wits without batting a proverbial eyelash. \r\n\tMark Knopfler does a wonderful job of working the soundtrack into something that, like the film itself, can be suspenseful, romantic, and goofy all at the same time. True, it can feel a little childish at times, but hey, you can't have everything now can you?  \r\nIn closing, The Princess Bride is truly a timeless classic in every meaning of the word, it's a film that has been enjoyed for over 15 years and will surely be enjoyed for years to come.",

With a talented company of actors, just the right amount of humor is applied to the all too familiar princess fairy tale.

Additionally, this approach is pulled off in a way that is suitable for the whole family.  There still seems to be a nod to the human condition and relatedness to love, but this movie maintains a humorous approach that makes following the story fun.",

            "content": "\"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\"\n    \nI know, I picked the most quotable line of this epic fairy tale (sorry for being such a cliche), but it was honestly the scene I enjoyed the most in this movie. Rob Reiner's The Princess Bride is one of his most revered films and it has become a cult favorite over time. I didn't fall in love with it however, but I can understand the appeal this romantic fantasy has on so many people considering it has it all: a tale of true love, adventures involving pirates, sword-fights, fantasy creatures, and a princess who is forced to marry against her will. The premise is no different from that of your typical damsel in distress fairy tale, but the way the film seems to be mocking and honoring those familiar elements at the same time are what makes it stand out. It has a unique innocent quality to it while remaining funny, charming, and sweet. Perhaps I would've benefited from watching this at a younger age, but having waited so long to experience it for the first time was a bit of an underwhelming experience. I wasn't swept away by its magical and fantastic elements and the love story didn't stand out from other romantic tales. There are several fun scenes and unexpected character interactions, but during most of the film I felt a bit bored. The satire works in parts and so does the fantasy, but it just felt too familiar to win me over entirely. \n\nThe screenplay was adapted by William Goldman from his own novel of the same name. Although for this film he uses a grandfather (Peter Falk) to narrate the story as he is telling it to his sick grandson (Fred Savage). At first the grandson isn't too keen about having his grandpa read him a story, especially because it starts off with kissing, but once the adventure begins he's hooked. There are occasional interruptions that bring us back to the kid's room, but most of the film takes place in this fantasy land where we are introduced to a very beautiful woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright) who falls in love with her farm boy, Westley (Cary Elwes). The two have found true love, but having no money to marry he embarks on a trip and promises to return to her. Buttercup is shattered when she hears that Westley was killed by a fearful pirate named Roberts. With nothing more to look forward to, eventually she gets engaged with Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) of Florin who promises to turn her into a princess. On the eve of her wedding, Buttercup is kidnapped by a man named Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) and his two hired henchmen, Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) a skilled swordsman who has promised to avenge his father's death, and the strong but gentle giant Fezzik (Andre the Giant) who really doesn't know no better. While holding Buttercup ransom and fleeing from the site, they discover that they are being followed by a mysterious man in a black mask. He catches up with them soon and the adventure begins as these men face off with one another and new revelations are made.\n\nAllowing for the story to take place through this narrative style was one of the better decisions because it gave the film its unique dreamy style and it wasn't necessary to deliver realistic visuals. It was all part of the fantasy, although I would've preferred less interruptions, but I guess they had to give Fred Savage and Peter Falk some more lines. The relationship between Elwes and Wright was believable, but it didn't stand out because it was too familiar. However, they were both the perfect casting choice for these roles. It was Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya who stole the movie for me. I absolutely loved his character and the sword fighting scene was the highlight of the movie for me. It included a brilliant homage to Douglas Fairbanks (which I'm sure gave someone the idea that Elwes would be the perfect choice to spoof his Robin Hood character in a later movie). Montoya was probably the inspiration for Antonio Banderas as well when he was cast to play the Zorro. This character has become an icon and he was the saving grace of the film for me. The rest of the characters were OK, but he stood out. The exception and I think I'm in the minority here was Vizzini. I found Wallace Shawn's portrayal of him rather irritating and I couldn't stand him. There is also a hilarious scene with Billy Crystal playing a miracle doctor, who you'd only recognize due to his voice because he is heavily covered in make up to look like an old man. The Princess Bride had its strong moments, but somehow I never managed to fall in love with the fantasy and wouldn't consider it one of Reiner's best films. It does prove however what a versatile director he is because the film is very different from his other works. I'm still a bit shocked that the film is so widely loved, but I can't argue it isn't a good movie.    \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

I could see why it would appeal to children. It's basically a comedic fairy tale adventure where true love conquers all. This movie also contains a lot of \"all-ages\" humor, most of it low-brow. While this can be fine, I have a hard time when the story isn't as entertaining as the jokes. The acting was sometimes laughable (and not in the good way), many of the sets were poorly made and obviously artificial, and I am one of those people who has a hard time ignoring plot holes. Perhaps, if I had seen it as a child, I'd be able to view this movie through a child's eyes like my friends do. Since that isn't the case, I have to judge it as I see it now: an adequately made children's story with some good laughs and some not so good talent.

            "content": "The Princess Bride is a welcome addition to the tired \"medieval damsel in distress\" genre that combines great action, great chemistry, as well as some laughs to make a winning combo.\r\n\r\nBased on the book of the same name by William Goldman, The Princess Bride is actually told by a grandfather, who's reading a book to his sick and rather video game distracted grandson and often the movie is interrupted by the grandson's quips and questions. The actual story stars a commoner named Buttercup and a stable boy named Wesley. The two fall in love, but because Wesley is so poor, the two cannot marry. Wesley leaves to gain his fortune, but is presumed to have been killed after his ship is attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Five years later, a depressed Buttercup is scheduled to be wed to Prince Humperdink who has the most unfortunate name in all of history. She's kidnapped by a group of wanderers (Vizzini, Fezzik, and Inigo), but is rescued by Dread Pirate Roberts. But is he who he appears to be?\r\n\r\nNow, long before I saw this movie, I had read the original book and greatly disliked it. I thought it was boring, overly long, and not funny enough. Thus, I wasn't excited to see this movie despite the great reviews. And yet, I'm ready to call this one of the better movies I've seen. The chemistry between Cary Elwes and Robin Wright really works and they sizzle on screen. Mandy Patinkin is fantastic as Inigo Montoya, and was one of the funniest characters in the whole film. Though, I think Andre the Giant stole the movie as the lovable giant named Fezzik. As you may have guessed, this movie is extremely funny with great fourth wall jokes and great timing. And the fencing scenes are tense yet comedic at the same time, mainly because of how over the top. It's really what makes Princess Bride, it doesn't take itself too seriously and is almost half parody.\r\n\r\nI'm so glad that I finally have run into a movie after some time that I can recommend to everyone. I think this a movie that anyone can enjoy, young or old. It's not sappy, but it's also not mean-spirited. It's a great film that just appeals to all ages. (Real rating: 96%)",

I really loved Mandy Patinkin as Indigo Montoya. One of the 80's best performances. I also felt that Cary Elwes did a really good job too.\r\n\r\nThe script is obviiously the strength. There are tons of memorable quotes in this one. Some are beautifully written, some are menacing, and there are many that are downright funny (\"There's a difference between partly dead, and mostly dead\" being one of them)\r\n\r\nThe fight choreography was really good too. This would have some of the best choreographed fight scenes untill 2004's \"Troy\" came out.\r\n\r\nOverrall, \"The Princess Bride\" is one of my favorite movies. Practically perfect.",

            "content": "An excellent fantasy tail about a thief, a princess, an evil intention, a man with a chainsaw, and a torture machine. Really. When you see the title that's called \"The Princess Bride\", you'll think about some sort of Disney film like Cinderella, right? This isn't one of those cases. Truth is, The Princess Bride is a mature fantasy tale. Sure, go take your 4 and 5 year old kids to see it... you'll not only regret it, but other parents who have seen the movie will look at you in a way as if they're thinking \"That look on his face... I've seen it before... it was my same face when I took my 4 year old daughter to see this movie...\" Please, think twice. That PG rating is misleading, as if it were rated by today's MPAA, then BING! Instant PG-13. Why? For a start, there are many F-Words in this movie, at least 9 of them, however, they're all in Spanish, so if you're children know fluent Spanish... beware... on the brighter side, the MPAA allows F-Bombs in different languages, as we all know, \"English is the most popular language on Earth\". Why did I put those quotation marks there, you ask? It's just that, a quotation from the Japanese Anime series Death Note, as well as the movie live-action movie, Death Note. Back to the topic, there is also a murderer with a chainsaw as a subplot near the end of the film. However, this is just a dark theme, and no one is ever harmed or killed (with the chainsaw, of course, there is still a huge body count), but this isn't some sort of Disney-like \"calm down\" effect. He is STILL a man with a chainsaw, so people will cower in fear if death as an insane man chases them down with a chainsaw. Oh, and by the way... that man is supposed to be a GOOD guy, just another tip for you. Last things last. There is a torture machine that emits electricity on the pull of the lever, and near the end of the film, someone even dies because the guy torturing him put it up a bit too high for the the man to live. I know this is more of a parental guide than a review (or at least it may seem), but it's just me saying that even men like myself will enjoy this movie very much. This is a must watch for people who love old-time fantasies. Oh, and just a reminder, when I say \"A Mature Fantasy Film\" I don't mean something quite as mature as the R-RATED Pan's Labyrinth (which I really want to see). It's still in a PG-13 range, so if you have a 12 or 13 year old daughter or son, feel free to let them watch with ease. Oh, and before you do, watch it yourself. Not to see if it's okay... but because it's a great movie.",

It is also a hilarious farce with brilliant lines and excellent characters.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with little Fred Savage at home, sick in his bed.  His mother tells him, much to his displeasure, that his grandpa has come over to cheer him up.  Grandpa comes in with a story to read to the young lad (\"In my day, television was called 'books').  The boy isn't too excited, but agrees to hear it all the same.  \r\n\r\nFrom here we are taken to the world of Florin, and told the story of Westley and Buttercup, who have found true love in one another.  This tale has it all: pirates, a giant, conspiracy, a poison-drinking contest, miracles, sword fighting, revenge, everything!  And it is all told with such light-hearted affection that it's impossibly charming and funny.\r\n\r\nFew films make me laugh so often as this does.  Its silliness is only matched by its dedication to the characters, who are all wonderfully realized.  Even Andre the Giant gives an excellent performance as the massive man Fezzik.\r\n\r\nThe film doesn't dwell too long on anything, having a running time of roughly 90 minutes, but never does it feel rushed.  Its pace is brisk and fun and by the end you feel as delighted and satisfied as the little boy, and just as he asks his grandpa to come over to read it again sometime, you'll want to see it again as well.  As far as comedies and fantasies go, The Princess Bride is simply one of the best.",

On page one there's a grade-schooler (Fred Savage) fighting an infection when his grandfather (the late, great Peter Falk) introduces to him a medieval storybook cinched with crime, royal politics, and romance, which flies on grounds of absence of any physical affection. Read on to note the heart shared by farm hand Westley (Cary Elwes) and princess-in-training Buttercup (Robin Wright). The flame is killed when a pirate ransacks Westley's ship for gold, and shreds the human evidence.\n\nJust one more thing, though: Westley's demolition was staged, and his passion pursuit gets fronted by Buttercup's new fiance the wicked Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), and thieves Fezzick (Andre the Giant) and Inigo (Mandy Patinkin), led by patriarch Vizzini (the always-welcome Wallace Shawn), who've kidnapped the princess for ransom. Easy does it. It's a mountain of stakes in Rob Reiner's courtly tune whose surface unravels to a knowing beat. The original receiver Savage wants to hang up the line whenever the tale gets caught in unjust scenarios, like Buttercup's wedlock to the murderous Humperdinck. As you wish, says papa Falk, freshly reworking the magic once more before return to Earth. \n\nNo objection: Reiner allows it. Tearing a page from \"Time Bandits\" and \"Ghostbusters\", \"The Princess Bride\" operates as fantasy and stylized contrast, albeit elementary. Indebted to escapism, Reiner and author-turned-screenwriter William Goldman treat the material with acute gratification. Find a skip in the track.

Let me list them off: Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Family, Fantasy, Romance, and Sport! Second, it's just a ton of fun to watch. When my friend at the movie rental store said this was one of his favorite movies of all time after he recommended it to me, I looked at him funny. I thought, \"His favorite movie is a chick flick?\". Little did I know how amazing it would be. It's as funny as Back to the Future, as romantic as Titanic, and as likable as The Wizard of Oz, and if that doesn't lead to a 5 star film, I don't know what will. It actually shocked me on how good it is, and that's mainly because the director, Rob Reiner, directed The Bucket List, which was good, but had the stupidest plot imaginable. Luckily, he kept things simple here, with just a grandfather telling a fairy tale to a young boy, who is oddly enough played by Fred Savage. This movie also has a great cast, featuring Cary Elwes, Chris Sarandon, and Peter Falk. The characters are comedic and likable, with my favorite one being Inigo Montoya. He's funny, likable, athletic, and has a developed personality. Even though Inigo is my favorite character, there are tons of great ones to choose from, and none are either unendurable or unfunny, which is another thing this movie has going for it. My only problem with the film was there were one or two boring moments, like the beginning of the boat scene, but luckily they don't last to long and they're worth enduring to watch the great scenes. Before I end this review, let me just say, Guys, don't let the romance vibe drive you away, the movie is amazing and hilarious, and even if you don't enjoy the romance, there are lots more things to enjoy to this movie.",
