That he did so, winning the 1938 Best Picture Oscar, is immensely to his credit.\n\nHobbling on the crutches that signaled the crippling arthritis that would soon confine him to a wheelchair, Lionel Barrymore is the focal point of the film as the grandfather of a wacky clan that believes in doing whatever makes them happy. So they dance, make fireworks, bake candy, paint, write novels, and construct toys with equal joy - laughing through the Depression with much love & great contentment. Jean Arthur, James Stewart & Edward Arnold co-star, with a mammoth cast of supporting players.\n\nThis is the movie for viewers who want to feel warm & safe & cuddled & protected.",

            "content": "Brought to you by It Happened One Night's Frank Capra, it's You Can't Take It With You, based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning play. Tony (Jimmy Stewart) and Alice (Jean Arthur) become engaged and bring their families together for the wedding. Tony's family is The Kirby's, the rich snobbish Wall Street business-types and Alice's family is The Sycamores, the eccentric, good-natured Southern folks. The best parts of the movie are the Sycamore family, particularly with Grandpa Martin (Lionel Barrymore), who, despite his physical handicap and lower social status, is an optimist and supportive of his family. He's such a cheery soul, even when playing his harmonica, you have no chance but to give into his joyousness. On the downside, the main leads are pretty, but thoroughly forgettable characters. Also, Meriam Kirby (Mary Forbes) is just as bland, except she's the typical rich snob stereotype that might as well grumble and utter quotes like \"Most unorthodox\" or \"How revolting,\" but that's part of the point. Playwrights George Kaufman and Moss Hart wrote the play in tribute to the tropes of Commedia dell'Arte, so I can't fault the actors for playing stock characters. Furthermore, this especially works in a conventional and fun movie like this. While not as classical as It Happened One Night, You Can't Take It With You contains as much charm and joy as any other comedy.\n\n(4 Crows Carrying Fireworks out of 5)",

            "content": "You Can't Take It With You is a Frank Capra film that was awarded the Oscar for Best Picture in 1939. It also garnered Capra his third win as Best Director.\n\nThe theme is a simple yet poignant one, kindness and love are much more important than money and things. Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) is a young woman from a very happy yet financially meager family. She falls in love with Tony Kirby (Jimmy Stewart), a vice-president at a bank run by his father. His father is close to settling a business merger that will make their wealthy family even wealthier. After Tony proposes marriage it becomes time for the families to meet.\n\nThe movie is based upon a play, and I can see Alice's family faring well with a live audience. But rather than coming off as quaint and eccentric on film, most of them come off as one dimensional equivalents of a brownstone Addams Family. In the basement a new comer spends all hours making scary masks, another older family member continually sets off fireworks in the house, Alice's mother continually types, and daft sister Essie (Ann Miller) spends every upright moment pirouetting and jet√©-ing throughout whatever room she is in. Their household is headed by Alice's grandfather Martin Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore) who encourages everyone to live life doing what they want to do.\n\nBy comparison, Tony's parents are extremely superficial and concerned only about status and wealth. As expected, the Kirby's disapprove of their son's choice for a wife, and their first meeting with her family ends up with everyone going to jail. In Capra-esque fashion, Mr. Kirby (Edward Arnold) eventually reevaluates his priorities and abandons his lifelong superficial ways in order to finally enjoy living and to share in his son's happiness.\n\nThe message is a splendid one that is applicable for all generations. With that said, the movie is quite dated. One can't help but notice the irony of Alice stating how everyone in her home is encouraged to do whatever they want to do in order to live life happily, while simultaneously they are being doted on by two African-American household servants who obviously aren't able to entertaining such a philosophy. It is a fine \"feel good\" film that reflects the America idealized by many from the time period.",

            "content": "I don't know if it's just me becoming more jaded with age, but You Can't Take it With You rings as more pathetically optimistic than inspiring even when compared to other classic Capra fare. Perhaps it's the lumping of all eccentrics into the box of some enlightened upper echelon while more practical people are condemned to live half lives. Maybe it's the fact that morality is completely binary in these films. Perhaps it's the tendency for Capra to base the resolution for his conflicts on some antagonist realizing the error of his ways and throwing their entire character out the window. I have a suspicion it's simply because time has revealed that, as Cassevettes suggested, \"there never was an America ... it was all Frank Capra\", and in America, the idealists never really win.

A funny and charming script that yes may have an ending that is predicable but the film stands out for its warmth and for appealing characters. A simple story about what you can't take with you when you die. Is money more important than friends? James Stewart has a smaller part in this but of course who oozes star quality. Jean Arthur is terrific as Alice , as are many of the cast. The Sycamores family is a bed of random people all doing their own thing and enjoying themselves immensely. The film has class and money as a main plot point. The scene is the dinner hall as the upper class are scared by a scream is wonderful and very funny. The Sycamores house has so many things going on and has so much love that you feel for them as they are about to move. The in laws meeting was terrific and expect the unexpected. The court scene was another delight as it was madcap as well. The neighbourhood looks a lovely place to leave and you glad that in the end all the houses stay as they are. A human and very touching movie. If the ending with the harmonicas and family dancing does not warm your soul then you aren't a live. Beautifully acted through a great script that showcases every actor. The director just lets the talented cast get on with it which makes a great director in my opinion.

For a Hollywood vehicle that told people what they wanted to hear, okay, but this fantasy lacks the grounding in reality that most fantasies begin with as a set-up.

            "content": "Frank Capra directed films are so ebullient and full of life with their colorful characters and unabashed corniness. This film is one of his many successes as it won the Academy Award for Best Picture in the same year that Angels with Dirty Faces (1938) and Of Human Hearts (1938) were released. I really liked it even as I could feel it aggressively tugging at my heartstrings which made me feel rather guilty for loving it so much. When a film emotionally manipulates you so well however I do believe it's deserving of praise for it's performances, writing and direction which are completely sublime.\n\nAlice Sycamore, Jean Arthur, is the youngest member of the eccentric Sycamore family, led by Grandpa Vanderhof, Lionel Barrymore, and her mother Penny Sycamore, Spring Byington. She is in love with her boss, the wealthy Tony Kirby, James Stewart, and they get engaged despite the disapproval of his snooty banker parents Anthony P. Kirby, Edward Arnold. Complicating things further is the fact that the Kirby family needs to own the land that the Sycamores live upon in order to put his business adversary out of business. When the Kirbys show up for dinner at the Kirbys house on the wrong night they encounter just how kooky they are and prejudices are revealed.\n\nThe story was so sweet, love prevails despite significant obstacles, that I couldn't help but be charmed and the characters were sketched with more detail than in more modern versions of this story. We actually spend time getting to know Alice and Tony before their families come into conflict and when we know why they love each other you really want them to stay together. The dialogue given to the haughty Mrs. Kirby is also fittingly infuriating as my hatred for her as a villain grew more and more the longer she was on screen. The film never asks you to be charmed by this insufferable woman as she is but asks you to want her to change. Seeing both Mr. and Mrs. Kirby overcome their prejudices was joyful and the image of two very different families happily united is a beautiful one.\n\nThe performances added to the brilliance of the film as Jean Arthur proves why she is one of the greatest romantic comedy leads of all time and James Stewart flexes his comedy muscles. They are both so lovely together and the fact that you believe them when they deliver sappy dialogue about how beautiful the other is helps you accept the tone of the film as a whole. Lionel Barrymore gives a performance that has weathered the 81 years since this film was released rather well as he is cantankerous and lovable all at once. Spring Byington managed an Academy Award nomination for her supporting role as Penny and she is deserving because she's absolutely luminous as the dancing sister who just can't help herself.\n\nDespite the powerful screenplay and performances this is Frank Capra's show as his usual style is applied to a story about a √Ø¬ø 1/2~little people' that is wildly and pleasantly sentimental. There is such a warmth to his direction as each scene naturally flows into the next and the film never really reaches a fever pitch but remains disarmingly appealing for 2 hours. He won the Academy Award for Best Director, his third and final, which I really appreciate because quieter films like this generally don't get rewarded as they should.\n\nThis film never matches the perfect opus that is It Happened One Night (1934) but no film could and this is still better than the majority of films released in the 1930s and has aged remarkably well. When considering 1938 as a year in film it wasn't particularly strong, especially when considering the fact that it was followed by the greatest year in cinema history: 1939, therefore I believe that the Academy chose the rare Best Picture winner correctly. If you like classic films then this will suit your needs perfectly as it features some of the biggest stars of the time and possibly the greatest mainstream director of the 1930s doing some of their best work at a point in time where there was still a large audience for this type of film.",

            "content": "A movie with a charming and heartfelt message that it hammers in way too forcefully and frequently, You Can't Take It With You is unsurprisingly preachy, as well as tedious and unfunny. I was expecting a lot from a Capra movie, having recently enjoyed It Happened One Night, which he directed only a few years before this. It was well paced, full of wit and developed a natural bond between its leads. YCTIWY is more than 2 hours long, and I don't think it got a more than 1 or 2 earnest laughs out of me. It feels like a funny script was written, then the jokes were removed, and they filmed what was left. It's implausible and, even worse, hypocritical. It preaches against wealth, yet the leads live in a big house, and no one seems to have much of a job, so how do they get by? It wants to constantly remind us that family and friends is what's important and money doesn't matter. So remember everyone, the next time you need groceries, go down to the supermarket and try paying in family and friendship. Exactly. I loved Jimmy Stewart, because its nigh impossible not to love Jimmy Stewart, but he's not given a lot to do, and I couldn't help feeling that the film would have been much more effective fi we could have seen the love interests meet for the first time, and spend more of the film with them, rather than constantly enduring the antics of the wacky Vanderhof family. It feels like a modern-day rendition of A Christmas Carol, only without the ghosts, and its ironic that the thing people love about it most, what made me enjoy it the least.",

In order to clinch his next deal his company, Kirby & Company, is buying up all the properties in a neighbourhood.  Everyone has sold, except one.  Martin Vanderhof won't budge, not for any offer.  He is happy where he is, living with his daughter, son-in-law, two granddaughters, grandson-in-law and a few other people in a community largely free of life's pressures.  Mr Kirby's son, Tony, is a new-appointed Vice President of Kirby & Company and is in love with his secretary, Alice Sycamore, Mr Vanderhof's granddaughter.  Their relationship, and the property issue, puts the two families, the Kirbys and Vanderhofs, on a collision course.  It's more than a clash of families but a clash of outlooks, ideals and what's important in life.\n\nDirected by Frank Capra who later went on to direct It's A Wonderful Life.  Like It's A Wonderful Life, You Can't Take It With You has a warm, fuzzy, sugary-sweet yet noble and liberating central message.  In It's A Wonderful Life, Capra surrounded that message with a wonderful plot, beautifully and sensitively executed.  With You Can't Take It With You, the execution is flawed, to the point that it negates the message.\n\nFrom the beginning of You Can't Take It With You there is a folksiness and raw, na√Øve idealism that makes the movie seem more like a children's fantasy than profoundly-themed adult drama.  No subtlety at all and it only gets worse once we meet the collection of oddballs in the commune.  They were meant to provide light entertainment but for the most part they are silly and irritating.  Particularly irritating was the Russian guy.  I presume his schtick was meant to be funny, but really he is just an obnoxious dickhead.  Xylophone guy was also pretty bad - pretty much a rednecked simpleton.\n\nSo, little to no engagement with the \"good guys\" of the piece.  Add to this the fact that Capra draws Kirby as a pretty much stereotypical, one-dimensional heartless villain and we have a movie with little in the way of character depth.  In fact, I was so disengaged, the more silly the \"heroes'\" antics became, and the more Capra turned Kirby into a cartoon villain, the more, out of a sense of rebellion, I rooted for Kirby!\n\nEnding can be spotted a mile off, the movie is that predictable.\n\nThankfully Capra didn't try to duplicate the formula when he made It's A Wonderful Life.",

I don't usually go for such brash, in-your-face optimism, but something about this ragtag group of merry, welcoming, open-hearted characters really struck a chord. Though it brims with loud personality - new faces pile in by the fistful each time we visit the house - there's a shocking level of character development at play here. That can be partially attributed to its roots in theater, and the associated volumes of dialog that are breathlessly peppered in, but I think just as much credit must go to the actors, who commit wholeheartedly to their roles (no matter how silly) and smoothly grant fast, earnest credibility. Stereotypes abound in the plot, from the sinister banker looking to tear down a merry little village to the happy-go-lucky grandpa who's always got the perfect sentimental speech prepared, but that legitimacy of character (plus the film's age) makes it all feel like a natural fit. And really, don't some themes ring eternal? A true classic that warms the heart and reminds us to slow down and ensure we're still getting all we want from life.",

In his film career, Capra made \"rags to riches\" stories about self-made men, and in tune with his political beliefs (he was a lifelong Republican who opposed Roosevelt's New Deal programs), were entirely made without the assistance of government.  His characters were the common man up against those who are greedy.  His films often had a moral character to them as well relying upon the goodness in human nature, the value of unselfishness and dedication to hard work and feel-goodness of his films led film critics to refer to many of his films as \"Capra-corn\" or \"Capraesque.\"\nThe film begins with Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold), a shrewd businessman, returning to New York after a trip to Washington, D.C., where he notifies his staff that his plan is in motion to become a munitions monopoly won't be interferred with by the government.  Kirby realizes the threat of war and the possibility of making millions.  His plan can only be realized if he is able to put a competitor out of business.  He plans to do this by buying up a 12 block radius around his competitor, he is notified that there is one holdout, Grandpa Vanderhof, a kind, old gentleman played by Lionel Barrymore.  Kirby gives explicit orders to his real estate broker to make him sell his property by any means possible, even force if necessary.  The real estate broker John Blakely (Clarence Wilson) is a stressed out man with an eye twitch, who is denied his commission until Vanderhof sells.  Kirby's son, Anthony Kirby, Jr. (James Stewart), called Tony, falls in love with stenographer Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur), who is Vanderhof's granddaughter, and proposes marriage to her.  Unbeknownst to everyone is that this is the house that refuses to sell.\nTony and Alice come from different worlds.  Alice came from a family where her grandfather stopped working in order to have fun and taught his family to value fun over anything else.  Tony has been brought up in a banker's family told that he will be a banker.  Alice's family is much more accepting of Tony then his family is of them.  Capra has always shown the upper class to be snobbish towards the everyday working class in his films.  Alice comes up with an idea, she asks Tony to invite his family to her house to meet her family.  The families are so different and contrast each other.  The Sycamores are a madcap mischivous bunch just trying to enjoy life in the simplest of terms.  The Kirbys are stiff, snobby and absolutely uncomfortable and embarrassed to be out of their elements in the Sycamore home.\nDuring the first meeting between the families, everything that could go wrong goes wrong.  The police comes to question them about leaflets they have been printing going into the granddaughter's Love Dreams cookies that say things like \"Watch out for the Revolution\" and \"The Red Flag is sweeping the country.\"  The police come to the conclusion that they are Communists and suddenly dozens of fireworks go off.  Now the Kirbys and Sycamores are locked up in the drunk tank in the local jail.  The film leads up to a courtroom scene that shows Kirby starting to have a little change of heart, though his wife isn't exactly warming up to the idea.\nLionel Barrymore is absolutely delightful as the kind grandpa Vanderhof.  He steals the show amongst a great cast.  The movie has some great moments, but it has a slow pace.  It builds up for two hours to an unsatisfactory ending.  It's a bit more dated than other great Capra films like \"It Happened One Night,\" \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" and \"It's a Wonderful Life.\"\nKirby may have all the money in the world and all the power, but as Vanderhof points out to him, he has no friends.  What's all that wealth worth?  You can't take it with you when you're dead.",

Capra's films often deal a lot with the essence of community and family that trumps all.  This film does just that and does it to perfection.\n\nIt stars James Stewart but the entire cast is incredible.  Stewart is very young and in the early stages of his career so the rest of the actors really nail each and every scene they are in.  In particular, Lionel Barrymore has about as good as of a performance you can have and the entire Vanderhof family gets their time to shine.  Much like It's a Wonderful Life, this film is not only very enjoyable, but it's highly re-watchable.  Capra does a great job of directing his actors to some of their best performances of their career, along with creating a unique household full of what is probably one of my favorite families in film history.  Everyone loves the Vanderhof's, and so do I.\n\nThe film is very light hearted and I can understand if people think it could be corny, much like It's a Wonderful Life, but I don't think there's anything wrong with having a story that everyone can enjoy.  It's the classic tale of Romeo and Juliet/Cinderella but it's told and structured in a unique way that really hits home.  It's a predictable but really sweet script that plays out just that way on screen.  I love everything about You Can't Take it With You.\n\n+Sweet story\n\n+Everyone in the family is interesting\n\n+Twist on the R&J story\n\n+Barrymore carries the film\n\n10/10",

            "content": "The rhetoric of this film is a little scattered to the winds. What I mean is that it is definitely well-meaning, but some of the advice given by the film is not practical. The whole main house does whatever they want to do and they live in a nicely furnished house with very little to want for. In real life, the tortured artist is a reality, you go broke following a passion without a Medici backing you up. As Mike Rowe would say, bring your passion where you go, rather than blindly following it, though no one would go amiss using their spare time for amusement and following dreams. It is true however, as the film says, that blindly trying to cut out the feet from all competitors, thinking you are better than everyone else because of your financial station, and solving all of your troubles with money will leave you friendless and with nothing at the grave. A happy medium would probably be better taken, or using the funds of the wealthy to, as a Medici, fund innovation and efforts to help the less fortunate. I love Jean Arthur and Jimmy Stewart and the whole rest of the cast (who can almost universally be found in It's a Wonderful Life, barring Arthur), but instead of hitting a note of inspiration, the film tries too hard to placate the dreams and notions of actors and artists and inventors. These are not bad people of course, but their kind of work leaves plenty of empty mouths when they don't go anywhere, and there are many working in Hollywood fast food right now trying to make it into the movies that never will. As the character Kolenkhov noted, he got paid and fed by teaching Essie how to dance, but frankly, she stinks and will never get anywhere. Often I feel this is the route of the college, fill the heads of students that they have talent, and so we feed and pay university teachers and deans, but really they know deep down that unless we win a life lottery, our degrees are worthless. I thought the film itself didn't drag and was fun, but by taking such a contrasted liberal view, they, as the character Kirby Sr. related, used emotional arguments that fell flat against the logic of reality.",

            "content": "PART OF MY CLASSIC VIEWINGS OF 2014 LIST\r\n\r\n\"Lincoln said, \"With malice toward none, with charity to all.\" Nowadays they say, \"Think the way I do or I'll bomb the daylights outta you.\" \"\r\n\r\nOut of all the film directors in the history of Hollywood cinema, there's never been a director that hasn't been as uplifting as Frank Capra. His films might feel a little corny in today's standards, but even so, with films like It's a Wonderful Life and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, you can't deny that Capra's uplifting stories of peace, happiness, and the joys in life are just timeless. But I've also known Capra for over-sugarcoating it a bit in his messages, which was why I wasn't that crazy over It Happened One Night. So when it came time for my experience with You Can't Take it With You, a comedy that, like It Happened One Night, won Best Picture (known for beating out The Adventures of Robin Hood, one of the greatest adventure films of all-time) and was a massive success among Great Depression struggling audiences, I was a little hesitant of whether I was going to like this film or not, especially since I disliked one of his most acclaimed films. But the good news is, You Can't Take it With You is not overrated in any way, but instead, an optimistic, funny, and heartwarming Capra classic.\r\n\r\nThe film is about the Sycamore family, headed by Grandpa (Lionel Barrymore), a former businessman who gave up the riches of life in order to focus on what truly matters, and by doing so, the rest of the family does what they desire to do in their own house, and are always optimistic even in hard times. His granddaughter Alice (Jean Arthur), the only one that feels \"normal\", has a job as a secretary at a highly successful bank, headed by the wealthy Anthony Kirby (Edward Arnold), who intends to make his son Tony (Jimmy Stewart) the next president in the company. Tony ends up falling in love with Alice, and in doing so, meets her kooky and eccentric family. But the hardest part comes when Tony invites his parents to meet Alice's family, and things then get super complicated.\r\n\r\nWhen I first turned the movie on, I didn't know what to expect with You Can't Take it With You. After being seriously disappointed with It Happened One Night, I almost gave up with watching more Capra films outside of Wonderful Life or Mr. Smith. But hey, the film had Jimmy Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Lionel Barrymore, who were great in other fantastic Capra films, so I decided to try out another Frank Capra, and I was impressed. \r\n\r\nFirst off, the comedy is great, more so than the dated humor in It Happened One Night. When we first get a good look at the eccentric Sycamore family, I knew this was going to be an entertaining film, and I was right. Scenes in the house were certainly the laugh-out-loud funniest, from Lionel's reasoning for why he doesn't believe in income taxes (to an IRS agent), the firecrackers in the basement, the Russian ballet instructor, and especially the reactions of the Kirby's when they come in the door. A problem I had with It Happened One Night was that the film turned into oober-cheesy melodramatic territory that made the film feel sugarcoated, artificial, and dated than what Capra was trying to make. The film does go dramatic in its final act, but unlike It Happened One Night, Capra's message about eternal optimism and the simplistic, laid-back approach of life can still appeal to today's faster-paced world like it did to the original audience that was still struggling to get by in the Great Depression.\r\n\r\nWith a strong cast like Jimmy Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Lionel Barrymore, I knew that these three talented stars can impress in a motion picture, especially when they have appeared in other great Capra films (Stewart being in this, Mr. Smith, and Wonderful Life; Arthur being in Mr. Smith; Barrymore being in Wonderful Life). The best when it comes to acting in this one is Lionel Barrymore as Grandpa. His laid-back approach to humor and life is something I haven't seen before in a motion picture (Cars doesn't count, cause that's a cartoon, but its similar message is still original for an animated film). Jimmy Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Edward Arnold are great in the more dramatic moments on the film, with the most effective being the moment where Jimmy reveals his real thoughts to Arnold.\r\n\r\nYou Can't Take it With You is a film that I was surprised that I would really enjoy. It's comedy is effective, the optimistic message still carries out to today's time, the acting is flawless, particularly Lionel Barrymore, and the film confirms the fact that Frank Capra is a great classic filmmaker. I will definitely attempt to watch more films from Capra now after enjoying this film, as I still need to watch films like Arsenic and Old Lace and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.",

The list of improbabilities goes on and on. Of course, none of this should matter because of the film's overall message, which is incredibly sweet, but it does. The outcome of 'You Can't Take It with You' would be entirely different if realism was taken into account, but seeing as the film is essentially a fantasy that was designed to appeal to an audience looking for hope in a time of depression, I can't fault its creators for making it schmaltzy.

So let's finish this decade with You Can't Take It With You.\n\nPlot: Tony is the son of a wealthy banker, Anthony P. Kirby who has fallen in love with his secretary, Alice. Alice tries to arrange to have Tony's parents meet her eccentric family, but they all find out that her grandfather, Grandpa Vanderhof is the person responsible for stopping Anthony from destroying his neighborhood for a large deal.\n\nThis movie is kind of hard to review because it's definitely one of the very nice, very charming kind of films that are a little hard to find anything particularly unlikable about it. While it can be a little slow and more or less predictable at what happens at the end, it's for the most part a light and simple film with charming characters, a great cast to perform them, some cute comedy that's rarely used but is still done pretty well, and a good fun simple story all around. The most notable actors/characters are Lional Barrymore as Grandpa Vanderhof with his optimism, wit and wisdom, (though I can't believe that's the same guy that plays Mr. Potter in It's A Wonderful Life), Mischa Auer as Kolenkhov mostly because of how her delivers his lines for whenever he says that something stinks, and of coarse James Stewart as Tony. Why? BECAUSE IT'S FRICKING JA-...you know what? Most of you regular viewers out there have probably read my review for The Greatest Show on Earth, so you know how I feel about the guy. Anyway, the only real complaint with this film that some people seem to have is how it's message can seem preachy. And I can see why people would feel that way with how it plays a bit more into the 'money can't buy you happiness\" kind of theme more or less, but for the most part, that's what make this film so simple, it leaves a good message that is a cliche today but isn't necessarily less important then it was back them it came out. Plus they told it in a rather unique way considering how particularly eccentric the Vanderhof family are, and that's a good thing to have I think with such a message.\n\nAnd that's my review for You Can't Take It With You. Even if it's somewhat slow and predictable and has a message you've probably hear before, it still has a fun cast, with unique characters, and a story that make this a nice, simple enjoyable film to watch.",

And \"You Can't Take It with You is so remarkably preachy that I found myself rolling my eyes so often I soon developed a headache.  I'm essentially politically aligned with Capra's left-wing compassion, but the characters seem more motivated by the director's political arguments than they are motivated by specific characterizations or the story's demands.  \nI also found the antics of the Sycamore household ridiculous.  The ballet dancer, the Russian, the fireworks -- all of it just seems so off the wall that I had trouble suspending my disbelief, and once again, I rolled my eyes.\nOverall, I'm aware that I'm in the minority with my dislike for Capra, but I still think this film is great if you want to roll your eyes a lot",

This is a timeless story, as relevant today as it was in 1938. It bravely tackles the pitfalls of Capitalism and the greed it feeds. This is a story of one family that throws out modern ideas of success and lives for the moment with spectacular humour and life!\r\n\r\nThe horrendous greed of banks is once again causing havoc in the West. Banks and commercialism dictate whether we are successful as in 1938.  Power is corrupted, life is dulled and peace and happiness are left in the sticky hands of those with the means to enjoy life without having to work menial jobs just to look the part.\r\n\r\nBut then there are people like the Vanderhofs who refuse to play the modern game and instead live out their days doing exactly what they want. Grandpa Vanderhof (Barrymore) is under pressure from banker, Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold) to sell his house so the developers can move in and build an ugly old warehouse producing goods, increasing their wealth! Grandpa stands his ground refusing all attempts of bribery, holding on to his way of life.\r\n\r\nEnter Alice, the Vanderhof granddaughter. She works for Kirby Jnr (Stewart) and they are madly in love. Here the fireworks literally start flying as the two families collide; one wildly weird with all kinds of eccentricities and the other prudish and materialistic. A huge dose of humility, humiliation and perspective gets thrown into the mix and you have a story and a half.\r\n\r\nThe characters make this film. And I'd like you to meet (most of) them. Grandpa is father of Mrs Sycamore (a budding amateur playwright), Mr Sycamore (plays with fireworks), Essie Sycamore (granddaughter, sister of Alice and try-hard dancer = hilarious), she is married to Ed (who seems to spend all his time playing the xylophone and peering out windows), two servants, a few more tinkers (who work in the basement on all kinds of STUFF) and the dance teacher Boris Kolenkhov (Essie's teacher who only comes to the house for the food).\r\n\r\nAdd to this list the Kirby family who bring their wealth, their power and their manners. These contrasting characters serve a greater purpose than simply humour. It is a comment on the western world; how money consumes us and puts us on unhappy paths where we no longer do what we enjoy, rather, we get bored to death in order to serve the mighty dollar. In the end, as the title suggests, you cannot take all this stuff with you!\r\n\r\nOn the whole this is a highly entertaining and soulful film. My favourite scenes were: the child band in the park (cool kids with cigars demanding a dollar for their services - including some crazy dancing), Alice sliding down the bannister in front of her future in-laws, the restaurant scene (classic slapstick), the russian dance teacher wrestling Kirby Snr. These are just a few. You must see this movie. It is beautiful, funny, deep and ultimately satisfying!!!!!!\r\n\r\nYou Can't Take It With You Trivia:\r\n\r\n* Budget - $1.5 Million dollars\r\n* This film is based on the Pulitzer winning play by Hart and Kaufman\r\n* Lionel Barrymore was suffering from severe arthritis during the shooting of this film which is why he uses the crutches. He had to have injections every hour to help with the pain. Poor Grandpa!!!\r\n* Ann Miller, who played Essie, was only 15 years old and cried after every take as the dancing took its toll on her body. James Stewart sent her chocolates to make her feel better. Sweet!\r\n* Frank Capra (Director) shot the film in 2 months and used over 41 times the amount of film",

She falls in love with a nice young guy (James Stewart) whose parents are incredibly wealthy and don't approve of his relationship to Alice, nor his desire to marry her. Alice tries to change Tony's parents's minds by inviting the mto dinner, but, thanks to her family, things don't go as planned.\n\nAll in all, this is typical Capra schmaltz: sentimental, charming, hard to really hate, and very populist. I enjoyed the film, but it's overrated, and maybe not necessarily deserving of Best Picture. The problem is not the message or the acting from an excellent cast (which includes a delightful Lionel Barrymore), but the execution. The first half is slow, meandering, and thigns don't really pick up or get interesting until the latter half. Even then, the film is predicatble, and doesn't really do anything new or groundbreaking.\n\nHowever, it is still pretty entertaining, well-meaning, and humorous, so, despite it's flaws, it's an old fashioned feel-good film worthy of a watch.",

            "content": "You Can't Take It With You is a screen adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway play by Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman. It centers on the Sycamore household headed by Grandpa Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore), a former businessman who proclaims that he once went up the elevator and then proceeded back down because he realized he never had any fun in that kind of life. In the household, everyone pretty much does what they please. Grandpa's daughter Penny Sycamore (Spring Byington) has become a novelist because someone mistakenly delivered a typewriter to to her home. Penny's husband Paul Sycamore (Samuel S. Hinds) makes firecrackers in the cellar with the help of Mr. DePinna (Halliwell Hobbes), an iceman who showed up one day at the doorstep of the Sycamores and never left. Their daughter, Essie (Ann Miller), is an amateurish ballet dancer who thinks of her dancing skills very highly, although her Russian teacher, Boris (Mischa Auer), expresses his thoughts of her skill as a simple phrase, \"it steenks!\" Essie's husband, Ed (Dub Taylor), is man who would much rather play his xylophone than work, spends most of his free time selling Essie's candy, wrapping each package in paper that is from a used printing press that dispenses anarchic slogans. The other daughter, and probably the most sane person in the entire household is Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) who is in love with the wealthy Tony Kirby (James Stewart). Tony proposes to marry Alice and decides to have his parents meet hers for dinner one night. Naturally, when the two families meet each other, the event is a disaster, eventually leading to the arrest of everyone in the household because Grandpa Vanderhof has not been paid his taxes.\n\nBecause Frank Capra has become more well-known for the fact that he directed It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, and It Happened One Night, You Can't Take It With You has become a sort of minor classic. Although it isn't deserving of that title. It's much much better than it suggests. It has it's own charm and is quite often funny, it also has as much pathos and sentiment as Capra's later masterpiece It's a Wonderful Life. The script is very well written and it also has some of Frank Capra's best direction; his Oscar for Best Direction was very well deserved, the dinner scene and the courtroom scene were both excellent. The film also has many of the finest comic actors of the time including Spring Byington, Dub Taylor, and Mischa Auer. It also has two of the finest dramatic actors of the time in James Stewart and Lionel Barrymore. One thing that makes seeing this film interesting after having long ago seen It's a Wonderful Life is that Lionel Barrymore, who plays the sympathetic character Vanderhof, would later play the villainous Mr. Potter, a character very similar to Edward Arnold's character in You Can't Take It With You. I much rather prefer Barrymore in this film than It's a Wonderful Life but one can't deny that Potter is one of the screen's greatest villains. Along with It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, and Mr. Deeds Goes To Town, this is one of the films that truly defines the adjective \"Capraesque,\" the definition of the \"American Dream.\" It's a film that I very much recommend watching. It's a great romance and a great screwball comedy that I think most will find it hard to not enjoy. 10/10",

Particularly the IRS auditor visiting early in the film and how the grandfather flustered him with his responses. Also, I can't let it pass without reiterating that I still can't stand Jimmy Stewart--not that he really has much to do to annoy in this film, since he's basically in the background as a straight-man hanging around a bunch of kooks.",

The lead charcters, portrayed by James Stewart and Jean Arthur, fall in love, but come from two different families, Stewart's rich while Arthur's poor (although Arthur's family is able to afford a Russian dance instructor for Anne Miller's character). Both are afraid to have their families meet and sadly for them, it happens, with nasty consequences. The art direction, the toys, and the chaos scenes in the restaurant, Arthur's house, and courtroom are quite good. The acting also is good and it is worth the watch. I just wish it was a little shorter. The other interesting thing is that Anne Miller, who is most well known for the musical \"On the Town\" was only fifteen in the film and she was already married, which was interesting casting from the producers. Overall, a nice film. You can tell that this film paved the way for Capra's other famous works \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" and \"It's A Wonderful Life.\"",

Though the two are in love, they find embarrassment and hard times when their families meet. I'll admit, this movie didn't catch my interest at first. Then the movie became cuter, then became funnier, then became more interesting. This comedy also improves on the acting as it moves along, and with famous stars like James Stewart (a scary young James Stewart) and Lionel Barrymore, shame on me for doubting them.\r\n\r\nThis movie does improve in it's directing as well. At first it's on set design and filming style was a bit too cliche for me, but as the story evolved, so did the directing. More in depth shots started so arise to capture the emotions of the characters in great ways.\r\n\r\nThis movie was one that took me by surprise. It's only for people who love the classic movies, but this movie has a great charm to it if you let it sink in.

            "content": "In the 30s and 40s no filmmaker captured the essence of Americana like Frank Capra.  His films were the very epitome of the triumph of the human spirit especially when intertwined with great adversity.  During his illustrious career he won three Oscars for his direction, and two of his films won the coveted Oscar for best picture.  He was a bold representative of a time in Hollywood when films did not need to be dark and foreboding to be considered award quality, and he capitalized on that notion with style and grace.  YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU is easily one of his most memorable and greatest achievements.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i51.tinypic.com/2w53p00.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nBased on the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU tells the story of the eccentric Sycamore family and their grandfather and ringleader, Mr. Vanderhof.  More than 30 years prior Mr. Vanderhof was a successful business man who abruptly left his office one day in order to have some fun with life and never returned.  His passion and free spirit became a staple in his household, and now all the Sycamores spend their day doing whatever they please.  Penny, Vanderhof's daughter, writes novels because someone delivered a typewriter to the Sycamore house by mistake 8 years ago.  Her husband, Paul, makes fireworks in the basement with family friend and resident Mr. DePinna.  Their eldest daughter Essie dances around the house like a ballerina and makes fudge, and their youngest daughter, Alice, likes to slide down the banister into the great room on her way to work.  Worlds collide for the Sycamore family when a wealthy Wall Street banker wishes to buy their property and the surrounding properties in order to build a factory for the manufacture of weapons for the looming war in Europe.  Grandpa is the last holdout, and banker, A.P. Kirby will do whatever it takes to get him to sell.  Little does Mr. Kirby know, but his son and newest vice president, Tony, is dating Alice Sycamore.\r\n\r\nAs a stage play YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU is an absolute delight to behold.  I recently had the opportunity to see a wonderful professional production here in my home town, and it was an intensely gratifying experience.  Without the constraints of live theater, (the entire play takes place in the great room of the Sycamore household) the film is able to expand locations in order to flesh out detail only hinted at on stage.  Under these circumstances the film becomes an exciting and entertaining companion to an already entertaining play.  For me this really helped increase my satisfaction with watching the film, but mind you, you do not need to see the play to enjoy it.  Capra's skilled direction drives the story effortlessly from start to finish, never slowing down and never leaving the viewer wanting.  It is easy to see why he was so highly regarded in his day.  Lionel Barrymore is deliciously elegant as Grandpa Vanderhof.  He delivers his lines with emotion and picture perfect comedic timing.  (I must add an exchange between him and an I.R.S. agent about paying taxes as one of my favorite scenes of all time.)  For those of you who are fans of another Capra work, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, Barrymore's performance adds an interesting and stark contrast to his portrayal of the malicious and ambitious Mr. Potter.  Jimmy Stewart also shines as Tony, the bridge between the Kirbys and the Sycamores and the son of a wealthy man who has already learned that wealth isn't everything.  Stewart has always exceeded at capturing the essence of the everyman, and it is easy to see why Capra chose to work with him on several occasions.  He portrays Tony with warmth and class, and one can't help but see true love and devotion between him and Alice.  Jean Arthur is also exceptional as Alice, a woman who loves her family and loves her man and hopes that the two will find a way to meet in the middle through her.  All in all, expert direction, stellar performances, and emotionally uplifting storytelling make this film a treasure that should not be missed.\r\n\r\nYOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU is light-hearted but not a product of simpler times.  Keep in mind that the U.S. was caught in the grip of The Great Depression and Europe was on the brink of war.  With that in mind Hollywood was interested in audience friendly escapist fare, and YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU fits that need nicely.  Is it silly and unrealistic at times?  Yes, I can admit as much, but its central theme still resonates true to this very day.  \"Don't become so entrenched in the grind of daily life that you forget what's truly important.\"\r\n\r\nThat's my opinion, and I'm sticking to it.",

I didn't quite like the video version of the live performance, but I most certainly enjoyed this movie, enhanced with great performances, a flurry of high comedy, family drama, and genuine emotion, its Capraesque style, an expanded New York setting, and a fine story. The characters (most of them quirky people that live together at Mr. Vanderhoff's house) are just as colorful and full of personality as in the live performance, which was its best asset.

In my case, I may have spoiled myself for this movie, since I watched Capra's far more endearing Best Picture (1934's It Happened One Night) just days before I watched this one. And it should be noted that those expecting something just as great as It Happened One Night will be slightly disappointed. So, while it would be a stretch to call it a \"great comedy\", You Can't Take It With You is still a very good film.",

The acting is incredibly convincing and the storyline and message strikes a familiar chord and resonates with our culture today.  The film may star Jimmy Stewart, but Lionel Barrymore and Edward Arnold steal the show (and seeing Barrymore play a character the polar opposite of Mr. Potter is delightful too).  Set in NYC in the final years of the Great Depression, Capra takes a typical rich-poor mismatch and turns it into a poignant commentary on what is really important in life.  As the film's title suggests, there are more important things than those that society values.  You Can't Take It With You should cause you to do some self-reflection and assess your priorities, and that is a powerful accomplishment for a 72 year old film.",

It has full of great performances and lessons that boost one's interest to see it till the end. I had  several hearty laughs and was teary-eyed because of its warm genuine depiction of human emotions.\n\nEven the the title speaks for itself, Lionel Barrymore, Jimmy Stewart, Jean Arthur, Edward Arnold were among the cast who brought and served light and sincerity to what the film wanted to convey. That you can't take with you the fortune and wealth you held so dear without risking the love and friendship from people around you who are more valuable than any material thing you could gain, own, or think of. Like 'It's a Wonderful Life,' this film depicted a memorable genuine treatment of humanity.\n\nThe emergence of sound films during the 1930s proved to be a great success because of several great films released during this time.

What do taxes pay for? Schools, roads, public works that are keeping people in jobs. Hey you know when the fire department showed up to save your house from going up in flames???? INCOME TAXES THAT PAY FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT! \n\nI think this is the movie here Capra turned around for me. I love his early works- which were all slightly subversive and about having sympathy for the culturally  unsympathetic characters that stick in your craw afterward. This is the start of the over-sentimental Capra that most people think of when they think of him. Now, that's not to say I HATED the movie. Bright spots are for sure Jimmy Stewart who is young, funny, affable, and sweet. Jean Arthur is also quite sweet and natural in her role. If the movie had just been about those two I might have liked it a lot better.\n\nBut oh no, we get bashed over the head with a fairy tale \"free spirit money is super evil\" moral that sounds all well and good on the surface but lacks any real introspective in trying to find any happy medium between being happy and having friends but still having responsibility.",

Frank Capra's \"You Can't Take It With You\" won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1938, but I found it only slightly entertaining. There are some very funny and charming scenes, but there are far more that are quite flat. The film is also overly long, suffering from a terribly slack editing job. The direction I found to be predictable and pedestrian, and I didn't find anything special about the acting.\r\n\r\nIt's surprising to me that this film won the Oscar. Capra also won for Best Director. The Academy appears to have been excessively in love with Capra in the 30s. He was nominated for Best Director five times that decade and won thrice! He's probably the only director in history to dominate the Oscars for an entire decade. His films were also routinely nominated for Best Picture, although they only won twice (\"It Happened One Night\" is the other). \r\n\r\nThe storyline of \"Can't Take It With You\" focuses on a young couple (James Stewart and Jean Arthur, neither of whom were nominated for Oscars) who wishes to wed. However, he's from a wealthy upper-crust family, and she's from a family of modest means. As is often the case in 1930s films, class tensions abound; and of course the rich people are depicted as bad guys.\r\n\r\nThe best thing about the film is the girl's quixotic family. Every person in the brood is encouraged to discover his or her unique talents and live them to the hilt. A typical evening with this family involves one child spinning across the room in pirouettes, another playing the xylophone with passion, another showing off his latest invention, which usually involve fireworks, and Mom and Dad watching proudly. Music, art, and fun are everywhere. There seems to be an unlimited supply of money, despite the fact that no one works. That is of course never explained.\r\n\r\nThe family also attracts strays, people who couldn't make it in ordinary society. They join in the fun as well. When the film is at its best, it presents a shangri-la of joie de vivre. I was impressed by the fact that some of the hangers-on were black. It was quite radical in this time to cast black actors, and the producers deserve extra kudos for that.\r\n\r\nBut none of the characters have any depth. They are ultra-crude caricatures, and most of the time the zaniness is predictable. Capra doesn't do much more than give them a big set and have them prance across it.\r\n\r\nEqually predictable and shallow is the struggle between the families, which rides hard on every stereotype imaginable. Nothing original is brought to the table.",

Jimmy Stewart is the boy and Edward Arnold is the father, in what is probably the best part (and character in the movie). The father is a bank president, and very powerful person. He's trying to organize a merger between several big companies, and is building a factory for this merged company. Unfortunately, there is one hold-out living on the land he wishes to build the factory, and he is refusing to sell. That hold-out just happens to be the grandfather of the girl. The grandfather presides over a house of nuts, who don't work but somehow can afford servants. They all seem to practice at artistic pursuits they're unsuited to, and therefore are very bad at. Anyway, despite the movie's dubious political message and the fact that Capra would use certain aspects of this film to greater effect in \"It's A Wonderful Life\", the movie is extraordinarily charming, and this is in no small part due to the wonderful performances by the cast. Which brings me back to Edward Arnold's performance. He could've been made to simply be an evil, greedy man who in the last act, sees the error of his ways. It's quite a pleasant surprise to find the character has some depth. Easy, emotional scenes could be seen as pandering to the audience, and the ending seems really abrupt, but once again, with performances this good, it's easy to overlook the sloppy bits.",

The dialogue is snappy and clever, like many of the quieter comedies of its era, and is great fun to follow along with. The ending is a bit sappy but fairly satisfying. James Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Lionel Barrymore are all fantastic in their individual roles. And I have to say the family in question reminded me of my own at times.

And it's almost equally as good, which is really saying something.  If there is a flaw to this film, it's that it takes a little while to build up, but I hardly minded it by the time the film really hit it's stride (when Stewart's impossibly snobby parents met Arthur's wacky family).  When you really think about it, though, Stewart and Arthur's romance wasn't even the main story- that, I think, belonged to Lionel Barrymore (Mr. Potter?!) and Edward Arnold as Arthur's grandfather and Stewart's dad.  At the heart of 'You Can't Take it With You' is a story about enjoying life and choosing between doing what you want to do (\"having fun\") or what people say you have to do (\"having no fun\").  All in all it's a great and touching film, and totally deserving of it's place in history as a Best Picture winner.",

The film employed a little bit of the kind of off-beat, jazzy noir that has trademarked a whole range of superb efforts in the history of film as we know it. Orson Welles' Touch of Evil, Altman's The Long Goodbye, several pictures by the Coen brothers. You get the general idea. Furthermore, the dialogue and story-progression in Anatomy of a Murder is very strong and thorough. The beautiful camerawork lingers just the right time in each juicy scene. \n \nReleased in 1959, the film came out at an interesting crossroads in time where it was clearly still a classic, major Hollywood production, but had a bit of controversial, daring content: i.e. direct references to rape, and some use of similarly strong language, which was - although used in a clinical fashion - still subject to controversy, and certainly impossible to have been found on a major feature a few years earlier. \n \nIn the film, a washed-up attorney Jimmy Steward and his even more washed-up partner take up a murder case that gets ever more ambiguous at every turn. Each person's motivations and reactions are depicted commendably well. The score (and cameo) by Duke Ellington is also very excellent.\n \n---------\n \nWith that relatively lenghty review it's sad to say I have little energy left to comment on the rest of these films, each of which would deserve just as much praise, if not more.\n \n---------\n \n[b]You Can't Take It With You[/b].

I have the greatest regard for this director for the type of cinema he made had great emotional depth; how wonderfully he analyzed people, relationships, society and situations and presented it on celluloid.\n\n             You Cant Take It With You, is a great story which makes us realize that only wealth we really can call 'wealth' is the one we can take with us up there. The film mocks artificial boundaries set by social classes, a boundary which after 70 years hasn't been bull-dozed. \n              \n          Jimmy Stewart's first Capra film has him in a very subdued performance. The stars of this show are Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold and the lovely Jean Arthur. Story telling is flawless and the plot very witty.

It's a shame that it took about an hour for the story to start revealing itself however, because this movie is pretty much a tale of two halves.  Once James Stewart's character's parents show up, things change for the better with a good mix of screwball-ish comedy, and heartfelt sentiments.  As with Capra's other movies, he's unbridled his message with optimism, and he might be giving a simple answer to a complex problem, but it's hard to deny the power of the ending when Stewart's uptight father is shown that life is much more than money.",

            "content": "[font=Garamond][size=3]I'm fresh off one exam and not yet studying for the next, hence this rare mid-week movie indulgence. Perhaps I've grown out of screwball comedies, but I am just not enjoying them lately - not \"Bringing up Baby\" or \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" or this film. Though it got some laughs, I found myself bored and irritated as well.\n   Tony Kirby (James Stewart) has fallen in love with his secretary, Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur). And now it's time to meet the family. His folks are as snooty as could be, wealthy bankers for generations. But hers are just plain eccentric. Led by Grandpa Vanderfhof (Lionel Barrymore), a harmonica-playing, stamp-collecting free spirit, the whole Sycamore family does just as it pleases. Alice's sister Essie (Ann Miller) is training to be a ballerina, under the tutelage of Boris Kolenkhov - who always manages to arrive at the house in time for dinner. Essie's husband Ed, a former college football player who likes to print Communist propaganda just for the fun of it, accompanies her on the marimba. Alice's mother spends her time writing plays, while her father has a fireworks factory in the cellar. And Mr. Poppins was just plucked out of an accounting job to become the newest member of the household, designing toys and masks. None of them seems to care about career or money, but they certainly don't lack for anything. When the Kirbies meet the Sycamores, there's bound to be a difference of opinion, to say the least. But whatever trouble comes their way - whether it by IRS auditors, arrests for disturbing the peace, or the prospect of having to sell their beloved house - the Sycamores face it all with joyful spirits. Happy endings abound, and the problems of the world are solved to the strains of \"Polly Wolly Doodle\" on the harmonica.\n   Of course, this being a Frank Capra film, there's always a message (and a crow, which makes multiple appearances). Here, the message is the same as always: be a good person, live life fully, do what you love, have as many friends as possible. Compared to \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" or \"It's a Wonderful Life\", I think Capra does a better job with his message without the screwball comedy. The problem is that whenever Capra gets serious, the film gets boring. The last 30 minutes, when all the realizations and character changes are being made, are a positive drag.\n   Still, there are more than a few interesting aspects to the film. For a start, it's almost disconcerting to see Lionel Barrymore playing the exact antithesis of Mr. Potter, the role he would become inextricably bound to 8 years later. Then there's Tony's great aspiration to design a working solar power engine, something we're still struggling with 70 years later. And I wonder how Grandpa's declaration that he won't pay income taxes until he's shown exactly where the money's going would be handled these days. The film's certainly not naive: there are plenty of mentions of the coming war and the lingering depression and the Communist threat. Also, for the year before Hattie McDaniel won an Oscar for \"Gone with the Wind\", this film has two very interesting roles for African-American actors - yes, they are the hired help, but at the same time, they are definitely part of the family. \n   So it's not that the film isn't funny and meaningful and well made - the acting and directing and writing are all in the right place. Stewart and Arthur do a fine job at romance and the characters and story are enjoyable. It's just that the film can't escape becoming a soapbox for ideals that have long since become passe - sad, but true.\n   Overall, an amusing screwball romantic comedy with a great cast and writing, but the pacing drags and the film is a bit too preachy for its own good.\n   [img]http://i567.photobucket.com/albums/ss112/medicatherine/you_cant_take_it_with_you.jpg[/img]\n[/size][/font]",
