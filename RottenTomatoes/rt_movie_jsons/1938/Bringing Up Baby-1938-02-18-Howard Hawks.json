On the day before his wedding, Huxley meets Mrs. Random's high-spirited young niece, Susan Vance (Katharine Hepburn), a madcap adventuress who immediately falls for the straitlaced scientist.

            "content": "A wacky, quick-lipped comedy from Howard Hawks, which foreshadows the director's sharper, later work on His Girl Friday. Bringing Up Baby follows a tightly-wound paleontologist (Cary Grant), out of his element on a fundraising mission, who crosses paths with an accident-prone chatterbox socialite (Katherine Hepburn) and her housebroken pet leopard. Grant's mild-mannered professor is immediately frustrated by the entanglement, but the more he struggles to extricate himself, the tighter he's bound. The girl is quicksand, basically, and she revels in the havoc she plays upon her unsuspecting prey. Eventually, somehow, the two develop a strong affection for one another, but not before they've ostracized a benefactor, misplaced a priceless fossil and spent a few hours behind bars.\n\nGrant was no stranger to comedies (his collaboration with Hawks would continue in the aforementioned Friday), but this was Hepburn's first foray into the genre. Rumor has it she needed a little behind-the-scenes coaching, but she pulls her weight in the finished product and shows strong chemistry with her counterpart. I was pleasantly surprised by the number of laughs in the first hour, especially given the movie's age, but it wanes on the home stretch and I didn't really care for either of the main characters: one irritable wet blanket, one scatter-brained troublemaker. They get into some good scrapes together, but fail to redeem their intrinsic faults and don't quite merit the happy send-off they both enjoy.",

            "content": "\"Bringing Up Baby\" is a film I unconditionally love; it is so utterly sublime a comedy that I was truly sighing, awed, 'it can't get better than this...' at many points. Yet it regularly does; Hawks keeps the momentum going majestically; it is one incredibly surreal, bizarre tangent going off unexpectedly into another, at every juncture. He photographs and presents his actors in the most charming and amusing possible ways, and the film is certainly a more leisurely, perfectly pitched film than \"His Girl Friday\", which I nonetheless admire. There is a beauty in the photography and simple choice of perspectives and angles that matches the\n\nThere is not one actress in the annals of film who I adore more than Katharine Hepburn; she is a compelling performer, of great charm, intelligence and wit; of very real, idiosyncratic looks that to this eye are beautiful, vivacious, impish. In \"Bringing Up Baby\" her Susan Vance is a very interesting diversion from her more usual type of character - the slightly superior, in-control ice maiden, as shown in say \"The Philadelphia Story\". She is phenomenal in that film, yet here beguiling in a completely different fashion, playing a slightly scatterbrained, sprightly, charmingly delinquent woman, who seems to have no control over anything; least of all her feelings for Grant. Her giddy, breathless exuberance and anarchic helplessness are really endearing; it's a wonderful film that stretches out the credulity of Grant's wonderfully straight-laced character's resistance to Miss Vance. The ending is a gorgeous, satisfying pay-off, as he finally gives way, as would we all! It's a charming, suitable ending that rectifies the slight fall-off of the preceding jail section of the film. That is very amusing, but in a more predictable, slightly laboured way. In stark contrast to the first 70-80 minutes of the film, which amounts to about the finest sustained American comedy I have seen of that length - \"Way Out West\" and \"Duck Soup\" being shorter in total.\n\nCary Grant, truly an institution of a comedic player, is very different to his more remembered persona of later years. It's remarkable to see this absurd little man, bespectacled, unworldly and cutting an orthodox figure played so perfectly by the suave Grant. This is gleefully played on with the sublime scene where Hepburn and Grant are trying to catch the leopard - Kate butterfly net in hand! She accidentally happens to break his glasses and is even more taken with him without them... The tension between how we usually remember Grant and the character he is playing here does add an extra layer of amusement to the film. Need I really add that the rest of the film's company are note perfect? Charles Ruggles, Barry Fitzgerald and many more really give the perfectly matched stars a fine backdrop.\n\nI shan't spoil too much of this heady, sublimely silly film... just go and watch it and see Howard Hawks, a master craftsman, at his best - there are no pretensions but making a quite wonderful character comedy - and Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant on insurmountable form. With these delightful stars and anarchic, scintillating comic material, what we have on our hands is an unutterably fine film, one of my very favourites of all time. Where else are you going to get such plot threads running simultaneously as: a hunt for a rare archeological find buried by a dog, an absurd upper-middle-class family dinner and an escaped leopard?",

            "content": "Bringing Up Baby - 10/10. Howard Hawks, Cary Grant, and Katherine Hepburn are some of the biggest and most successful people from the Golden age of Hollywood. Though each person had amazing careers later on after this film, Bringing Up Baby is a perfect example of a film that was well ahead of its time, and once it was appreciated, was considered as a masterpiece in its respective genre. The movie is probably the first film in the now super popular screwball comedy genre. Back when it came out in 1938, the film bombed at the box office, and even lead to having Hepburn losing out on film roles because of its unsuccessful initial run. But the film gained a better reputation as the film started playing on television in the 50s. Many films of today can learn a thing or two in the way the comedy is presented and delivered in this film. Grant and Hepburn play up the odd couple dynamic really well, with Grant's uptight nature and Hepburn's bubbly mannerisms helping bring a nice levity to the proceedings. The movie is littered with zany moments which feel over the top in the right way. What a lot of comedies do nowadays is try to make shocking moments that are so ridiculous, yet this film understands the perfect balance of zany and natural humour. Hawks provides the viewer with a quick and fast movie which translates really well all these years later. You're aware of it being a classic film, but it doesn't feel that way in the slightest. Time just flies by watching the movie, and its just a really fun time overall. Hopefully the movie never ever is remade, because I highly doubt anyone can top the performances that the whole cast gives in the film.",

Every scene is full of humorous misunderstandings and clumsy physical comedy (lots of falling down short slopes), such that even cinema titans like Hepburn and Grant often feel distressing and just plain annoying (they should rightly be better remembered for their more serious roles), and I can't say that their chemistry is particularly memorable. There are several moments of dubious shooting quality, where actors often talk over one another in a manner that you'd think might justify another take in a film that relies on comedic timing, but were ultimately deemed satisfactory. Plenty of memorable one-liners do help out, and the jailhouse scene brings out the best of the film's formula (particularly Walter Catlett's easily confused Constable), but I can't say this is a top entry among early romantic comedies; the film seems distinctly amateurish compared to the well-aged Gable/Colbert It Happened One Night.

She is absolutely brilliant in this movie, blending slapstick, witty repartee, and even a little 'come hither' romance in a wild, frenetic script. She even does a mean gangster impression towards the end. Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and a leopard, hey, what more could you want? One of the highest high points of the entire screwball comedy genre, with its sharp script and wonderfully balanced leads. Recommended for all. This film is an absolute joy. 10/10",

If it was handled differently this is the kind of thing that could bother me, because I hate to see a protagonist who is a nice guy forced to suffer so much. However, the cast makes it work for me here. Cary Grant is such a great comedic actor that he can be utterly overwhelmed and still seem like he\u2019s having a good time. His struggle to be polite when everything is falling apart around him made me laugh so many times. It also helps that Katharine Hepburn plays her role with so much ignorance. She never once feels malicious, as if she intends to make life miserable for Grant\u2019s character, it\u2019s just that she doesn\u2019t always understand what she\u2019s doing. At times her character feels a little over-the-top and too much of a dizzy dame to be believed. Because the film built so much comedy out of her crazy personality, I was willing to accept it. The supporting cast was also marvelous, especially Walter Catlett when he has to piece together all the insane things that all these characters are telling him in the final act. That whole sequence in the jail had me laughing hysterically. I did think that Bringing Up Baby started to spin its wheels a little too much when they entered the phase of searching for Baby. The jokes all became a bit similar and it felt like people were going around in circles without progressing the story too much. I also knew where it was going at that point so I just wanted them to get there. However, this section of the film didn\u2019t linger for long, and shortly after that they reached the jail and things got hilarious again. One of my favorite things about this style of screwball comedy is that the jokes keep coming rapid fire, so even if something doesn\u2019t work for you it won\u2019t be long before someone will throw out another silly line.This isn\u2019t the kind of movie where they give the punchline and then pause for a laugh, in fact half the times the jokes are just thrown away without bringing any attention to them and you can miss them if you\u2019re not paying attention. This delights me because it will make revisiting Bringing Up Baby a real treat as I discover some of the subtle things I missed the first time. I laughed more at this than most other movies I\u2019ve watched in years, and any complaints I have are really just minor quibbles. This is a movie I hope to add to my collection and watch many more times in the future. I could see it easily becoming a favorite of mine. ",

For, as far as filmmaking is concerned, there are scenes projected in here, that might drop your jaw. The director Howard Hawks must be a good comedian. Since what he finds funny might not marginally come under everyone's jurisdiction. Let us first give the respect to the visual department. How smartly have they pulled off some imageries. For instance, a dog fighting a leopard or in that case anything with leopard. Just like, George Lucas used efficiently productive methods on set to create a whole new world, Hawks is tricking you nicely.\n\nMaybe these are the moments that led the industry to use more artificial things or sprinkle something post production, hence films like Wings makes you challenge yourself. In plot, I'll tell you one thing, the irritation does communicate with me. There are loads of verbal sparrings and loud noises, it's like if Martin Scorsese met Aaron Sorkin and together they were on steroids. It can be too much, easily. The screenplay is smartly and highly detailed and still the gags are kept prior to the narration.\n\nNo matter how well it is done, you can always tell apart after you are done with the film. The chemistry is another major note. It is off the hook and if you want to see a good example, watch them coordinate with each other in sync in the beginning of the party sequence. The issue that I had with was Cary Grant's character and not of Katherine Hepburn. He is the catalyst. She is one smart cookie in every situation. Just watch her get her way out of ticket, she knows what she is doing. Bringing Up Baby is actually a \"how to not\" novel, and unfortunately \"how tos\" are not my thing.",

The two make for an infectiously goofy onscreen pairing, with the surprisingly meticulous plot of the film facilitating a journey that is -- again -- somehow both exhausting and exhilarating at once. It's a sure-fire success that I won't soon forget.",

Unfortunately, he meets Susan, a woman who seems destined to unintentionally destroy his life.  Huxley soon finds himself playing nursemaid to Baby, her leopard.\n\nDirected by Howards Hawks and starring Cary Grant as Huxley and Katharine Hepburn as Susan, this movie is ostensibly a comedy classic.  That's hard to fathom, unless extreme irritation is classified as comedy.  \n\nThe irritation starts almost from the word go.  Somehow we are meant to be believe that someone stealing another person's car and then smashing it up in nonchalant fashion is funny.  Susan is incredibly annoying and there is no light at the end of the tunnel - the annoyance continues throughout the movie, down to and including the final scene.\n\nIt's not just Susan - the whole 'plot' is random and just involves dumb things happening.

She is absolutely brilliant in this movie, blending slapstick, witty repartee, and even a little 'come hither' romance in a wild, frenetic script.  She even does a mean gangster impression towards the end.  I think the issue at the box office in 1938 (and subsequent label of her as 'box-office poison'...ha!) was that she didn't fit into accepted standards of \"feminine\" at the time, which is a shame, because she's got it all here.  \n\nGrant is not so bad himself, with that suave accent in a nerdy role, finding himself helplessly drawn into Hepburn's crazy world.  He's much better here than in 1944's \"Arsenic and Old Lace\", despite the obvious comparisons.

The screen treatment, by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde, made this movie the classic it became to be after not being embraced by the public when it was originally released.\n\nThe pairing of Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn paid off handsomely. Both actors were at their best in the film. Mr. Hawks got excellent performances of his two stars. Cary Grant's paleontologist, with his glasses, and nervous energy, matches perfectly the the socialite that has designs on him. There is a high level of energy in the film that was a requirement for a movie of this genre.\n\nThe supporting cast is also one of the things that make this film the fun it is. Charles Ruggles, May Robson, Barry Fitzgerald, George Irving, and the rest of the cast do a marvelous job in the roles they created. Even Asta, the Charles' dog, made a valuable contribution to the proceedings by appearing at key moments, even fighting Nyssa, the tamed leopard that is the \"baby\" of the title.\n\nThe best way to enjoy the film is to let the magic Howard Hawks created put its spell on you.

I could deal with a story that was a little too ridiculous if it backed that up with some good comedy, but the greater majority of this movie's attempts at comedy were just random pratfalls.  There were a couple of funny moments of wordplay, but you would first need to wade through nearly constant babbling from the cast of the movie that needed to express their every thought and action verbally in case the audience had chosen the wrong direction to point their seat while watching it.  I couldn't even really get behind the performances from Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, whose characterizations were too on the nose and annoying for me to find but a few moments of passing affection for them.  Thankfully for this movie, it's already regarded as a classic and has generally favorable reviews, so it will get by without the recommendation that I just can't bring myself to give it. \nFull Review at: http://robertreviewsstuff.wordpress.com/2013/12/12/bringing-up-baby-1938/",

            "content": "Back in the 1930's, one of the biggest film genres in Hollywood cinema was the screwball comedy, meaning comedy with fast-talking, fast-comedic action making the film either really funny or really stupid. Bringing Up Baby, one of the decade's many screwball comedies, is one of the funniest.\n\nPaleontologist David Huxley (Cary Grant) is working on completing his dinosaur exhibit to earn a million dollar grant and even go into marriage with his female partner. While golfing with some potential business partners, Huxley is spotted by wealthy woman Susan Vance (Katharine Hepburn) who vows to marry the man herself. She tricks him into attending her home in Connecticut to help take care of her pet leopard Baby. But the real trouble begins when Baby escapes, the dog George runs off with Huxley's dinosaur bone, and a more vicious leopard escapes from the zoo, looking exactly like Baby.\n\nOther stars in the film include Charlie Ruggles as Maj. Horace Applegate, May Robson as Susan's aunt Elizabeth, Walter Catlett as Constable Slocum, and George Irving as businessman and attorney Mr. Peabody.\n\nBringing Up Baby is one funny movie. And I mean, really funny. The film is directed by Howard Hawks, which surprised me, cause he's known best for directing John Wayne Westerns (Rio Bravo and El Dorado). Hawks can do comedy as well, and Bringing Up Baby proves it.\n\nThe cast is a hoot. Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn are spectacular together as the unlikely couple in the film. Both actors use their amazing talents and bring out the best in them, even though the two would later go into more dramatic territory in their later Hollywood years. Charlie Ruggles is memorable as the major, while May Robson is hilarious as Hepburn's aunt. Baby the leopard is also well-trained, and is just about as funny as the two leads. So is George the dog.\n\nBringing Up Baby features some of the funniest situations ever put in a film, with some pretty memorable dialogue along the way. In one sequence, when Hepburn distracts Grant from his golf game with Mr. Peabody, Grant repeatedly hollers, \"I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE, MR. PEABODY!\" In another, when Grant is forced to wear a woman's bathrobe, and is asked about it by the aunt, Grant jokes, \"Because I just went gay all of a sudden.\" (That cracked me up, right there.) And in the finale, when just about every single character is in the slammer, mostly due to the crazy claims about the leopard, the Constable responds, \"If anyone else claims they saw a leopard I'll put you behind bars.\" Actually the entire jail sequence is one comedic, crazy, ride filled with pure craziness, particularly when Hepburn pretends to be a gangster.\n\nThe thing that makes me mad about this film is that it originally was a box-office flop. How, you ask? Well, Hepburn was difficult to work with, and her attitude caused most audiences to ignore the film. Hepburn was labeled \"Box-Office Poison\" and many directors ignored her. Hepburn finally got her big break a couple years later with The Philadelphia Story, which made Hepburn a major star, and was later called the greatest actress of all-time by the American Film Institute. That's says something when she was called poison for Bringing Up Baby.\n\nBox-Office Poison or not, Bringing Up Baby is one hilarious film, with great performances from Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant, crazy comedic sequences, and a well-trained leopard. It's a comedy well-worth seeing.",

But now generally hailed as a paragon comedy by consensus, I wonder maybe I was born in a wrong era. I am not saying I dislike the film, it is a tongue-in-cheek urban tale which generates unsolicited laughters abound, but the off-putting disposition of Hepburn's Susan does impede me from fully appreciating this work.\n\nThe story is a straight arrow zoology professor David (Grant) meets a scatterbrain wealthy girl Susan, who is inexplicably smitten with him, they first met in a golf field and without any context, once Susan sets her eyes on him, she is playing all the manipulative tricks to keep David from getting married and as stereotyped as it sounds, after a succession of zany slapsticks (mainly concerns finding a pet leopard and a barking dog), the two prove they really deserve each other.\n\nGrant is quite proficient in his usual orbit of a harmless gentleman with a double chin, plagued by laughter-induced mishaps when he is die hard trying to procure a million dollar donation for his museum, inconveniently the benefactor turns out to be Susan's auntie (Robson). Hepburn, never exemplifies herself as an excellent comedian, makes a great effort to match Grant's comic timing with her hotheaded whimsy, but the result is rather a hyperbole than a substantial stretch. Supporting players are basically expendable, Charles Ruggles' hunting-drivel-talking leopard-growl-mimicking dinner guest is the essence of what a bore a bourgeois boffin could be, and for whom we should all weep.\n\nHawks manages to show off some camera artifices to shot the scenes between human cast and the carnivore feline, it is still magically done although we all witnessed the CGI tiger in LIFE OF PI (2012, 10/10) with awe and amazement, I suggest a remake with swapped sex, a well-heeled young man possessed with a priggish female zoologist, I doubt anyone could take the challenge, sex equality is still a halfway deal, and it goes without saying there will be a slew of CGI beasts around them.",

While schmoozing a rich lady's lawyer on the golf course, he runs into Katharine Hepburn, a scatter-brained (yet attractive) lunatic who brings trouble with her wherever she goes, especially to the scientist.  For good measure, they throw a leopard named baby (whose favorite song is \"I Can't Give You Anything But Love, Baby\") into the mix and you have what might be director Howard Hawks' screwiest screwball comedy, lighter-than-air and yet heartily amusing.  If there can be any criticism (and really, it's hard to take too critical a glance at something so lightweight), it may be with Hepburn and her portrayal of Susan Vance.  The character is willfully ignorant, is mainly used as a means of advancing the comedic situations.  But in working so hard to achieve this ignorant arrogance, the film loses a little bit of it's momentum (and good will).  It's only once the film really gets rolling that Hepburn's comedic inadequacies can be overlooked (in fact, the film is almost a tale of two performances from Hepburn, the overly affected and forced first half of the performance, and the more flowing feel the performance achieves by the end).  It's an unusual film to say the least.",

The next day he meets a socialite (Hepburn) by accident and through a mix up he finds himself being taken to her home in order to help take care of a tame leopard named Baby. In the following chaos a dog buries the bone needed for the dinosaur, visitors come, Baby runs away, a wild leopard is on the loose, and the free-spirited girl finds herself falling for \"Mr. Bone.\" To complicate matters, the pair wind up in jail trying to explain their story to a quirky constable. In the end everything works out and despite the craziness, Huxley realizes he cannot live without this girl. This may not be  my favorite screwball comedy, but I would say it definitely is the zaniest and that stands for something.",

Everything is going smoothly, there are funny mix-ups, the growing frustration of the Grant-character and the growing enthusiasm of the Hepburn-character are played out perfectly, until the point in the movie where 'Baby' (the leopard) breaks loose and all characters go to hunt her. That's where the movie starts to drag terribly. The last half hour is a pain to sit through. A very disappointing ending to a promising movie.",
