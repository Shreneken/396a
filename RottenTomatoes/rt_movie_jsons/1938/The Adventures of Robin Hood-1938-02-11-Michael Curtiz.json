            "content": "This film *is* the Robin Hood of the screen: it's merry and witty, tender and bold, impudent, dashing and brightly clad... and an undoubted legend in its own lifetime! I recently had the chance to see it in the cinema for the first time, with the release of the remastered print, and wondered if it could possibly hold up to televised childhood memories. The joyous answer is that indeed it does. It's not only the breathtaking adventure I remembered; it's a fiery and surprisingly gentle romance that isn't afraid of laughs.\n\nIt's unthinkable, once you've seen it, to imagine this film with anyone other than Errol Flynn. Every subsequent interpreter has had to struggle to reclaim the part from the memory of his roguery and grace - and most modern 'Robin's have been handicapped by an insistence on authentic mediaeval murk and grime. In the 1930s, with Technicolour the latest craze, mud and homespun were the last thing a studio wanted. Flynn's Robin Hood sports the Lincoln green of legend and a forest as brightly coloured as a painted backdrop, and the rich furs and silks on show at Nottingham Castle are straight out of fairy-tale; or an illuminated manuscript.\n\nThe story itself is purest escapist magic. Greedy barons, a wicked usurper, a rightful king in exile, and a proud beauty in distress... and, of course, England's eponymous outlaw hero, robbing the rich to give to the poor with a jest on his lips in true swashbuckler style. The script sparkles. And the stunts, in those days before wire-fu or CGI, are all for real and still take the breath away. Flynn was in superb physical condition at the time - co-star Basil Rathbone, who played his proud opponent and would-be suitor to Marian's hand, Guy of Gisbourne, described him simply as 'a perfect male animal' - and misses no opportunity to show off his flamboyance.\n\nUnlike today's pretty-boy heroes, however, Flynn shows a surprising talent for acting with his face alone. The expressive reaction shots throughout his boudoir scene with Marian tell a different tale to the quickfire banter of his words, and, like Marian, despite ourselves we are drawn in. Olivia de Havilland, as Marian, is somewhat ill-served by her period costume - she is at her most beautiful in this scene, without her hair confined in her wimple - but together they duel their way through a classic tempestuous romance of the high-born lady and the outlaw, ultimately risking their lives to save each other. Marian is no anachronistic action heroine, but no-one, not even Robin, can keep her from what she thinks is right.\n\nAs Guy of Gisbourne, Basil Rathbone is also playing one of the landmark roles of his career, and gives a superb performance. His Gisbourne is no cardboard villain, but a clever, arrogant man, who matches wits and blades with Robin as a worthy rival, and whose courtship of Marian is not without grace. And his wily master, rufous Plantagenet Prince John (Claude Rains, in a small but well-cast part) is no fool either. He knows precisely what he wants and what he can get away with, wasting no time in bluster or empty threats.\n\nComedy of a broader nature is provided by the cowardly Sheriff of Nottingham, and by Bess, Marian's maid. But even Bess's farcical courtship with timid Much (she has buried more husbands than he has had kisses) is not without its tender moments, and perhaps only the Sheriff is entirely a cut-out figure of fun.\n\nFew people can whistle 'the theme from Robin Hood'. But the famous Korngold score, with its full orchestral depth and rousing fanfares, is as familiar today as it was seventy years ago, when it won its Academy Award. From the faultless casting through unforgettable pageantry and timeless romance to the final spectacular duel, when Robin and Gisbourne meet \"once too often\", this picture richly deserves its reputation as *the* Robin Hood on film - from which on present showing it is unlikely ever to be dethroned.",

The massive sets and clanging swords, brought to life in stunning Technicolor, it could and did blow minds and pushed the limits of what an adventure film could be, even if Flynn was relatively familiar and the adaptation of the classic source material was relatively conventional. There isn't as much of a storytelling flair here as you might expect; take the archery competition - John's men deviously scheme it for the audience, and then the film just cuts to the competition itself. There's nothing in the way of preparation or deliberation, everyone knows there's an archery competition incoming so that's where we jump to. But this predictability and lack of imagination is largely compensated for by the visuals, atmosphere, and soundtrack, which are so vibrant and rich that nearly a century has not dimmed their classic appeal.

With an excellent supporting cast, it is no wonder the movie was a huge box office hit. In addition, this a family movie.

            "content": "When I was twelve I saw Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) and was extremely underwhelmed as the film had an overcomplicated plot and featured characters lacking in any depth. Where that film failed this timeless 1938 classic succeeds as it features perhaps the definitive swashbuckler leading man in Errol Flynn and makes a strong argument for the use of Technicolor. It is very easy to fall in love with the film as it is relentlessly entertaining and refreshing in how straightforward it is as it does not attempt to reinvent the wheel but does what has been done before exceptionally well. Unlike later imitators like Ivanhoe (1952) it is still a rousing piece of entertainment and would still bring joy to youth audiences today with it's optimism and simplicity.\n\nIn the late 12th century the honorable King Richard the Lionheart, Ian Hunter, who is devoted to helping the poor and disenfranchised is taken hostage by Leopold V, Duke of Austria and if the English want him back they will have to pay a ransom. In his place his treacherous and corrupt brother Prince John, Claude Rains, ascends to the throne and begins to steal from the poor for his own gain and force them to pay high taxes. The man who defends the poor is Sir Robin of Locksley, Errol Flynn, who steals from the rich and gives to the poor but he faces opposition and in trying to win the heart of Maid Marian, Olivia de Havilland, he must teach her about inequality. He earns a victory in an archery tournament meant to lure him to his execution but when he arranges with Marian to have the King saved she is imprisoned and he must find the King and help him take his rightful place on the throne before it is too late.\n\nThe look of the film is extraordinary as the vaunted bright colors produced by Technicolor are on full display here and it allows the film to be more memorable than most from this era. While later iterations of this story would adopt a cold, blue sepia tone that did not allow for the inherent fun and wackiness of the situation to be exploited. The brightness of this film matches it's innocent tone and sense of freewheeling adventure as it allows for the loveliness of a young de Havilland to be highlighted and the bright fabric of their costumes to come to life. To an adult audience it will be immediately clear that the film has been shot on a studio back lot and an orchard owned by the studio somewhere out in California but this artificiality does not really matter. While watching the film you can revert to feeling a sense of childlike wonderment with the larger than life characters and fantastical locations.\n\nWhat the film also benefits from is smart writing as unlike Ivanhoe it follows the very simple story of a man with socialist ideals facing off against an evil villain who saves the day and gets the girl. It helps that all of the characters proclaim their feelings without reservation and seem to exist in a world where moral grey area does not exist. If performers without the force of personality of de Havilland or Rains had inhabited these roles they might have seemed flat and lacking but they are each aware of what sort of film they are in and play to their strengths wonderfully. She is all doe eyes and breathless proclamations and he plays the type of stern elder statesman who would become his bread and butter in later years. Flynn is not an actor I am enamored of but he fits into this film nicely and for the low bar that he has to jump over with all of the excellence around him he is quite competent. It is easy to see why de Havilland Flynn made so many films together, eight in total, as they have wonderful chemistry and her potential as a great dramatic actress shines through in many of their romantic scenes.\n\nI can't recommend this film enough as while it is hardly important in terms of it's content it stands up as one of the best swashbuckler pictures ever made.",

            "content": "The greatest version of Robin Hood!\n\nMichael Curtiz' swashbuckling adventure classic The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) remains my favorite incarnation of the Saxon lord robbing the rich and giving to the poor. \n\nErrol Flynn portrays the green hooded archer Robin of Locksley as a charming and charismatic leader and loyalist to King Richard the Lionheart. Flynn is the quintessential actor for Robin Hood due to his amiable attitude, dazzling swordplay, and astonishing archery. Basil Rathbone is sublimely entertaining as Sir Guy of Gisbourne as the villain with his hard glares and disdainful misgivings.\n\nOlivia de Havilland is lovely and enchanting as the heroine Maid Marian. She uses her hopeful eyes to display a fervent amour for Robin Hood, a respectful admiration for Hood's good deeds, and a distrustful disgust at Prince John's treachery and ambition. Speaking of Prince John, Claude Rains is funny as the dastardly monarch, who reign of cruelty terrorized England in the Medieval Ages. \n\nMichael Curtiz' direction features all manner of innovative direction and thrilling action that makes this shorter film feel only a half hour long. From long range arrow shots, splitting arrows, sword fights down staircases, to shadows duelling, Curtiz' style leaps from the screen into your imagination. Combined with Erich Wolfgang Korngold's sweeping romantic score, The Adventures of Robin Hood is a treasure chest of delights.\n\nIn all, The Adventures of Robin Hood is a pleasant time with every viewing no matter how many times I return to Sherwood Forest.",

A time when things were unfair and kings killed people just for speaking their name wrongly.\n\nClaus Rains plays a vicious, evil,  and corrupt king. But it's very hard to not like him even a little bit, what not with his charm and his humor. Robin Hood, as we all know, is the man of the people. But seeing him in action, was great.\n\nAwesome choreography of sword battles and arrows. And amazing stunt work. Especially when Robin Hood climbs the castle walls. This movie makes we want to live in a castle, own a horse, and learn archery.\n\nIt was a truly surprising seeing a fat wield a sword like a general does. He was quick and abled. This movie is so charming and lovable, it's hard not to watch it. There was something really special in the scene where Robin Hood and Marian see each other in the castle. There's this explosion of chemistry between the two and seeing it in color, instead of black and white, was a real treat. The actress who plays Marian, let me tell you, she a looker, for sure.\n\nI love how it ended. Nothing like good ole' justice being served and everything going back to the way things were - good and just.\n\nOverall, terrific movie with an awesome cast of characters, great story, and terrific stunts and choreography. Robin Hood shows us the importance of what it means to do good. We can all learn from his doings and hope that one day we will all have the leadership qualities such as Robin Hood's.",

            "content": "Wow, for star power, it's hard to beat Errol Flynn as Robin Hood and Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marion.  Flynn had the perfect devil may care attitude for the part of Robin, and his impudence towards the pretender to the English throne is fantastic.  de Havilland is absolutely stunning and plays her part well as the noble who is offended by Robin at first, but is then slowly won over to his humanity and righteousness.  The movie features all of the standard sorts of things we've come to expect in productions of Robin Hood - camaraderie, swordplay, honor, and daring escapes, among other things.  I loved the stunts, including Flynn cutting the rope to a gate, and then being pulled upwards by its pulley in order to get over it while leaving his pursuers trapped on the other side.  The cast is strong throughout, from the main villains (Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains) to charming characters like Marion's old nurse, played by Una O'Connor, who has a little romance of her own.\n\nThe film is in color and quite a production for 1938, really showing how far movies came over the course of the 1930's.  I loved the costumes from Milo Anderson, particularly those for the 22-year-old de Havilland, who directors Curtiz and Keighley wisely took every opportunity to shoot close up, allowing her beauty to shine, and her eyes to display fear, annoyance, anger, and love.   Her scenes with Flynn are magical.  The only thing I fault the film for is the soundtrack, which I found too jaunty and intrusive, even for scenes which had a lot of action in them, but that's a bit of a quibble.  The only reason I don't rate it higher is because the story itself has been done so often that it's lost its shine for me personally, but if classic adventure stories with romance in them are your thing, I think you'll love this film.",

Yes, most certainly but so is the acting in King Kong (1933) and The Wizard of Oz (1939) and those 2 are also considered some of the greatest movies of all time. The campy acting is in my eyes certainly not a flaw, i think the campy acting we had in old movies is only a good thing, it reminds us of how innocent and unexperienced Hollywood was back in the day, and i think that's a beautiful thing that should be treasured.\nAside from the hammy acting, i personally think it's a flawless film, the script is perfect, simple, exciting and emotional, the art direction is top notch, so are the costumes, and music is supportive and beautiful, the stunts and choreography is spot on, the set pieces are enthralling, so are the fun characters, and the pacing is fast to keep the movie going. (especially for a movie that's almost 80 years old, this is one of the most modern, old movies i've ever seen)\nThe innocence of The Adventures of Robin Hood is delightful, this really is a timeless movie for all ages, kids of today could easily enjoy a movie like this too, and not fall asleep. The Adventures of Robin Hood is such a fresh, fast-paced exciting film, it really is something special.\n\nSay what you want about The Adventures of Robin Hood and how campy it may be.

And even though eyes are being poked out and ears cut off by the bad guys, this is still exhilarating and fun, as Robin's rebelliousness is charismatic and cheeky rather than angry.  Of course, the good guys do not always come out on top, but Maid Marian (played by Flynn's usual love interest, Olivia de Havilland) is on hand inside the castle to help them escape.  Director Michael Curtiz (stepping in after William Keighley was let go) keeps things moving at a good clip, such that one fabled episode after another comes rollicking through.

I loved the mix of comedy and drama. I really did have some hearty laughs thanks to the banter between the characters, and I also tensed up in the more dramatic moments because I didn't know what would happen next. What surprised me most was how much Disney stole from this film when they made their animated version of Robin Hood. That movie copies several scenes from this one beat-for-beat. I've always been fond of that particular version of the Robin Hood story, and I think that translated into some extra love for this one. The stars of the film deserve a special mention. Errol Flynn is like Tom Cruise, as he is suave and charming, but also game to participate in some intricate stunts. Olivia de Haviland is lovely, and brings some strength to a character that might otherwise be your typical damsel in distress. Basil Rathbone is a perfect counterpoint to Errol Flynn, as he has equal measures of charm and athleticism. Finally, Claude Rains plays Prince John perfectly, as a weasely man who will stop at nothing to assume the throne. Needless to say, I quite enjoyed The Adventures of Robin Hood. There were moments when I thought it spent a bit too much time in exposition where none was needed, but I think that was merely the style of movies from the era. I'd recommend this to fans of classic cinema and those who are interested to see the origin of true swashbuckling action.",

I guess there was nothing really memorable about the movie for me to be excited for when I watched it recently, and that still holds true (I watched the whole film this time, don't worry).\n\nFor one thing, the plot is extremely simple, and to add to the filmmakers wanting to make things clear for the audience, at several points in the movie a paragraph of text is displayed to explain what is going on in certain aspects of the story. Don't worry guys, we can follow this plot. The king of the nation goes missing, and his brother John is trying his best to take the throne for himself. He begins to tax the poor even more to collect a \"ransom\" since word is spread that the king has been kidnapped, but really this is a way for him to buy his way to power.\n\nOn the other hand we have the hero, Robin Hood, an outlaw who for the sake of the use of color in the film is often seen wearing very bright green clothing (and tights). It would make sense for him to dress more raggedly like his followers, but I think at one point it is stated he was a nobleman. This character recruits people of the lower class to reclaim the money Prince John is stealing and return it to the true king, Richard.\n\nWith a large set for the castle and many extras, the best moments of the movie are the swashbuckling scenes in the castle, well- choreographed to get the most action they can into the frame. Not to say the action is amazing, but that it was well-done for when this film was released.\n\nOverall this was a pretty average film, very simple but fun to watch at points, and never too violent - I don't think a single core character is killed in this film. This film would be a great way to introduce kids to \"older\" movies.",

His brother, Prince John (Claude Rains), assumes the throne and proceeds to tax and oppress the poor Saxon population. One Saxon, Robin Hood (Errol Flynn), forms a band of merry men, such as Little John (Alan Hale), Friar Tuck (Eugene Palette), and Will Scarlett (Patric Knowles), to end the corruption of John's terror, defeat his henchman Sir Guy (Basil Rathbone), and win the affection of Maid Marian (Olivia de Havilland).\n\nAlso, Melville Cooper appears as the Sheriff of Nottingham, Una O'Connor plays Marian's servant Bess, and Herbert Mundin plays Much, the miller's son.\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood is a pure, genuine classic. There are many sequences that still hold up well today, especially in today's age with most of the action sequences receiving help from CGI. The score is also one of the all-time greats, and it probably inspired John Williams a lot.\n\nI am very impressed with the cast, particularly Errol Flynn as Robin Hood. Although he was not fond of playing a man in green tights, his performance is great and will be remembered as his most famous role. Considering that he and Olivia de Havilland hated each other in real life, their chemistry comes out really strong, particularly in the love scenes. Basil Rathbone makes a great villain, and his swordfight with Errol Flynn is exciting and suspenseful. Even more impressive is the fact that the stunts in the swordfight inspired the lightsaber battles in Star Wars.\n\nMy only problem with this film is the acting chops of Claude Rains as Prince John. He just didn't seem evil enough to play a jealous brother. Peter Ustinov's voice performance of the same character in Disney's cartoon is more evil than this. Claude Rains has done good villain roles before, such as Hitchcock's Notorious, but this didn't impress me.\n\nFor people who want to take a break from CGI-filled action scenes, The Adventures of Robin Hood is a Technicolor delight. Errol Flynn makes a delightful Robin Hood, and newcomers will sure be thrilled as I am.",

            "content": "Before \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\", Michael Curtiz co-directed this, \"The Adventures of Errol Flynn\"... after doing 111 other projects and before doing 54 more projects. If you think that I'm exaggerating those numbers, I'm not, and before death finally caught up to Curtiz, his name was attached to 166 projects, so I reckon it's safe to say that he had a relatively successful career, as surely as Errol Flynn led a relatively successful career as a swashbuckler, back when most people actually knew what in the world the term \"swashbuckling\" means. Well, of course Flynn was going to lead a successful career as a swashbuckler, because the man had the name of a pirate, or at least the name of an aviator... I reckon. I'm sorry, I'm from Alabama, where we don't say \"aeroplane\" as much as you ignorant Yankees might think, but have to hear it all the time from the satire by, well, you ignorant Yankees who don't realize that we are, in fact, much more cultured nowadays, so much so that we gladly embrace this here old movin' pitture about some fruity-lookin' feller usin' some kind of a fancy bowin' arrow that wouldn't stand a bit of kudzu's chance in a tractor race against my crossbow to save some lady, which is irocnick, or whatever them college folks say, because all he's gonna end up doin' is beatin' her if she comes close stepping out of the line that God put women in to make sure that they don't go and mess up this purtty world that us kindly white men worked so hard buildin' (*insert spit and subsequent ting sound effects here*). Interesting how this opener to a discussion dealing with a classic swashbuckling film set in England during the Middle Ages ended up touching upon redneck satire, but hey, I could have picked a more irrelevant topic, seeing as how we are talking about someone who lived so far south that he was born and raised in Australia, kind of like that Keith Urban feller who plays country music like good ol' Hank Williams. Shoot, I can't even joke about Urban's music being real country, rather than just pop rock with a twang, and besides, I'm really going off topic at this point, because this film is so old that it came at a time when we were just getting used to country music. Oh well, it's still a decent flick, and yet, much like yankee views on the South, its not without some questionable spots.\r\n\r\nIt's a fluff piece of the 1930s, so of course certain lively touches have dated, yet that doesn't really make them any less cheesy, because even though the film hasn't turned cornball by now, it is not without somewhat cheesy moments of fluffy filler that throw you off, though not quite as much as the focal unevenness. The film isn't dizzyingly inconsistent, but it does have a tendency to break up direct, if a tad aimless sections in its narrative as an adventure film with some shifts into typically ultimately necessary, but hardly organically incorporated happenings that could have perhaps fit more comfortably in the midst of this film's focal structure if storytelling actually took the time that it should, or rather, any time to meditate upon fleshing its story out. Again, this is a harmless adventure flick, and one revolved around a highly recognizable legend, so it's not like I'm asking for much by any means when it comes to development, but the film feels very undercooked, featuring lapses in exposition that dilute both the full effectiveness of the characters' motivations and the firm distinguishing of the members of this conceptually dynamic character roster, while leaving certain events to feel hurried in and repetitious, and further detrimental to your engagement value. Something of a core problem that sparks the aforementioned unevenness, underdevelopment is arguably the final product's biggest consequential problem, and yet, with that said, the underdevelopment isn't too disconcerting, which means that there's even less to the cheesiness and unevenness, thus leaving the final product with only so many errors in storytelling, but primarily because, quite frankly, there's not a whole lot to this story to begin with. When I called this film a fluff piece, I really did mean that it was harmless fare for its time, with a topic that could be built into a strong story, but is instead the basis for a barely consequential popcorn storyline, which may ultimately be presented in a fashion that is entertaining enough for the final product to succeed just fine as a fun popcorn flick, but is just too thin to be all that memorable. Consequential flaws are made a bit more glaring by this story that isn't as rich as it perhaps could have been, slowing down momentum that was never to have too much kick, until you end up with a fluff piece that it plenty of fun, but a fluff piece, nevertheless, complete with not enough kick to be especially memorable. Still, while the final product isn't necessarily a deeply rewarding ride, it is a ride that's reasonably worth taking, having shortcomings within its story's concept and telling, but enough in the way of fun factor to liven up your mood a bit, just like how sharp musical aspects liven up the film itself.\r\n\r\nThis film's score, composed by Erich Wolfgang Korngold (Great name), is by no means especially unique, but it's hardly as trite as plenty of other film scores of the classic era of Hollywood, and that allows you to have a bit more appreciation for this score's strength, which is indeed mighty, combining soulful elegance with thrilling boastful through thorough liveliness that helps greatly in bringing this film's high entertainment value to life, while also helping to sell you on this film's tone. What sells you on the actual look of this film is, of course, the efforts of art director Carl Jules Weyl and costume designer Milo Anderson, who do a decent and rather stylish job of restoring the Middle Ages through nifty designs that go complimented by Tony Gaudio's and Sol Polito's lushly colorful and comfortably scoped Technicolor cinematography. Gaudio and Polito add the film's good looks with then-fine photography that is still fairly pretty to this day, while also putting tight framing to good use during the action sequences, which are few and far between, and held back by sensibilities of the time, but still well-shot, well-choreographed and all round well-staged enough to thrill just fine, not necessarily as a reinforcement of what sense of consequence there is to this fluffy storyline, but certainly as a compliment to the swashbuckling adventurousness of this popcorn piece. Some of the liveliness touch-ups just discussed are about as strong as I make them sound, with some being even stronger, because even though the film has dated as a popcorn entertainer, enough color within its musicality, look and action has stood the test of time for the film to get off a pretty good start when it comes to standing as a fun flick. Of course, what really secures the final product's entertainment value is the sketching out and telling of this story, which is, as I've gone on and on about, hardly all that rich, to where you get all that much of a sense of weighty meat, but still colorful, with a harmless adventurousness that gives this film the potential of being, if nothing else, the fun fare that it ultimately is, largely thanks to both a script by Norman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller that delivers on plenty of sharp wit, as well directorial performances by Michael Curtiz and William Keighley that hit one lively beat after another. Curtiz and Keighley keep pacing brisk and spirited, gracing this film with a charm that goes fed by the charisma found throughout this cast, from which leading man Errol Flynn stands out by making sure that his being well-cast does not go to waste, nailing the heart of the legendary Robin Hood with such assurance that he becomes the role and, by extension, both one of the most memorable portrayers of a highly recognizable character, as well as a driving force in the film. This flick is what it is, and what it is is merely popcorn fare that was never to be all that compelling or memorable, so all it can be is entertaining, and sure enough, if this effort is nothing else, it is plenty of harmless fun, with style and charm that remain sharp enough to this day to entertain thoroughly, even if such entertainment comes at the expense of kick to substance.\r\n\r\nWhen the adventure is done, cheesy spots and some focal unevenness prove to be offputting, though not as much as the underdevelopment and structural hurrying that are still not too worthy of complaints, as this film's story concept is a shoestring-thin one with limited consequence and memorability, thus making for an underwhelming final product, but one still reasonably worth checking out, as lively score work, appealing production designs, handsome cinematography, thrilling action and an adventurous narrative, brought to life by witty writing, well-paced directorial storytelling and charismatic acting - especially by the well-cast and immersed Errol Flynn - go into making 1938's \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" a fun popcorn piece that won't stick with you for very long, but proves to be enjoyable while it occupies your reasonably well-spent time.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

Not only was Errol Flynn's Sir Robin of Locksley enjoyable to watch, it increased my appreciation of Men in Tights even more. It's absolutely ridiculous, even campy at times, but it's some of the most fun I've had watching an older film.",

            "content": "On paper, this Robin Hood could easily be read as the most pompous, insufferable jerk imaginable, constantly belittling others and laughing at their misfortune. On screen, Errol Flynn brings a charming playfulness to the role that is an absolute miracle. I love his performance, and I love this film. It's chock full of delightful characters, hilarious moments, and incredible action sequences. The sword fight choreography is seriously breathtaking (as fast and impressive as anything in the \"Star Wars\" prequels, but with a far greater sense of peril and excitement), and the vivid colors of the sets and costumes are just gorgeous. There are times when the bad-guy killing feels excessive (Remember that guy on the ladder? Did they really need to shoot him in the back?), but the bloodless stylization of it all makes it much easier to accept (Personally, I like to believe he was just injured). What a marvelous movie.",
