    "summary": "Actor Rick Dalton gained fame and fortune by starring in a 1950s television Western, but is now struggling to find meaningful work in a Hollywood that he doesn't recognize anymore. He spends most of his time drinking and palling around with Cliff Booth, his easygoing best friend and longtime stunt double. Rick also happens to live next door to Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate -- the filmmaker and budding actress whose futures will forever be altered by members of the Manson Family.",

Tarantino est nostalgique d'une \u00e9poque qu'il n'a pas connue et s'offre un film qui lui fait plaisir \u00e0 lui, avec des acteurs excellents. Sauf qu'il nous laisse en dehors, l'histoire n'a ni queue ni t\u00eate, c'est totalement superficiel, gratuit. Les personnages ont l'\u00e9paisseur de ces poup\u00e9es d\u00e9coup\u00e9es dans du papier. Les hommes s'en sortent un peu mieux, mais les personnages f\u00e9minins n'ont aucune \u00e9paisseur, les filles sont cruches et bien s\u00fbr sont de 30 ans plus jeunes que leurs homologues masculins (on voit bien que c'est un mec de 60 ans qui a fait le film). Pour finir, Tarantino joue \u00e0 la fin sur un suspens glauque et d\u00e9gueulasse au sujet de Sharon Tate, et cela se termine dans une apoth\u00e9ose de violence insoutenable... Non, Tarantino est auteur compl\u00e8tement surfait, et on ne me reprendra plus jamais \u00e0 aller voir un de ces films.",

It is alternative history and how something as small as what happens can change historical narrative and history forever. It is a fascinating and great concept that just may be above the general watcher. The ending sequence is so amazingly coordinated and hilarious that you have to watch. I have re-watched this movie twice in a matter of weeks because I loved it so much.

The lack of a real storyline both makes the film feel both feel spontaneous and random, yet almost documentary like, as if you are discovering what will happen next at the same time as the characters. Tate, played by Margot Robbie is a seemingly small and unexplored character within the film, yet her contrast with Di Caprio's character and their differing experiences of Hollywood make her an interesting asset to the movie none the less.  The ending scenes provide the most storyline the film is willing to give, but don't quite tie together the randomness of the preceeding hour of so of film. I don't believe this is necessarily a negative, as the characters, set and dialogue are compelling enough that the lack of a story never slips into the realms of being boring. In fact, the scenes of driving through 60s Los Angeles, along with Cliff Booth's undeniable cool factor and slick lines, make the film exciting and enjoyable even before the typical Tarrentino action ensues.",

This one certainly had probably the most laughs I've had at a Tarantino film and it's stuck with me more each time that I watched it\u2026when you go to the movies you want to be entertained and when you watch a Tarantino film, you know his primary goal is to take you into his movie world and give you an experience. The acting is phenomenal down to every single character. The dialogue is witty and smart, and the direction and photography along with the set design is sublime. And the best part is this really is a buddy film (  and you can feel the love between these two friends, Rick Dalton, and Cliff Booth.) Leo and Brad play them to perfection. Kudos that the Academy recognized Brad Pitt for his performance, but Leo was phenomenal as well and the direction and movie as a whole was just a blast. And it brought attention to an actress I really didn't know much about other than the Manson murders.  Margot Robbie was terrific as well in her portrayal of Sharon Tate . I certainly hope Tarantino is going to give us at least one more masterpiece before he hangs up his directors chair.",

I didn't cheer when the good guys killed the Nazis in Inglorious Bastards. I just found it completely stupid. Same with this horrible ending. Unless you are doing major world building then rewriting major historical events in isolation is just, really, really stupid and more then a little bit weird.\nOutside of that there is pretty much zero plot here. Just following around a has been actor and his tough guy lap dog until the final fever dream at the end. \nIt's DiCaprios worst performance in a while. The accent is just awful. \nPitt does more with a single look than 100 lines from DiCaprio. But then Pitts sycophantic, tough guy character is not very believable. To be believable he would have had to punch DiCaprio's character right in the face several times because no self respecting person would endure DiCaprios constant sniveling.\nMargot Robbie is in it but has so little screen time you'll forget all about her.

My only beef with any QT film is that he stays in that revenge zone a bit too long. It feels good to repay evil with suffering. The questions is: how much can a good person punish evil, without himself becoming evil? One effective head bash is sufficient in most cases, but doing it over and over just makes the protagonist look like a fiend. Perhaps QT has been holding up that mirror to teach that fact.

The majority of the film is split between Leo DiCaprio's pitiable Rick Dalton, a former movie and tv cowboy star, now washed up and looking for a second wind; and his best friend/stuntman/chauffeur Cliff Booth, played by the always charismatic Brad Pitt. Together they go about their day-to-day lives in 1969 Hollywood, and really thats about it. The film masterfully plays with audiences expectations, especially those familiar with certain tragic events set to take place one fateful night in August involving Rick's neighbor, Sharon Tate, endearingly played by Margot Robbie. In Tarantino's Hollywood there is an ever-looming threat one cannot escape from, and not just from the hippies. One never truly feels safe, as though the ball could drop at any given moment, and Tarantino knows that we have come to expect this. So instead he builds up tension for 2 hours before pulling the figurative trigger and delivering exactly what we want.",

            "content": "'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' sounded like it would be a great film from the get go. Although Quentin Tarantino's films have been spotty in recent years, his best work such as 'Reservoir Dogs' and especially 'Pulp Fiction' are masterpieces. The cast consists of many immensely talented actors. It looked great from the advertising and who cannot help resist that title. That it was one of the year's most positively received films further added to the interest.\n\nAlthough it is not quite perfect, 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' to me was as great as hoped. One of Tarantino's best in direction, writing and as a film as an overall whole in recent years, towards the better end of his filmography and one of 2019's best films, its positive reception richly deserved. It is unmistakable Tarantino in a good way and a great representation of the cast, with many giving some of their best work in recent years.\n\nWill start with the very, very few things that didn't quite come off for my tastes. Some of the pace, especially for a film as long as it was, could have tightened and not every scene felt necessary. Actually would have trimmed some or all of Sharon Tate in the cinema, regardless of how beguiling the production values and Margot Robbie's (that smile is a beauty) acting were.\n\nDid think too that the Bruce Lee caricature and encounter were quite tasteless and anybody who was offended can't be blamed.\n\nThat sounds like a film worth a 7 or 8 out of 10. The good things though were so amazing and the film was in a different league to a lot of films released this year that to me awarding 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' either of those scores felt too low. It looks wonderful, dazzlingly shot with shots filled to the brim with atmosphere, stylishly edited with a lovingly recreated period. Tarantino directs with great confidence and his distinctive style is all over it. The music is used sparingly, but the music choices are very effective when used. Particularly so the quite sinister use of \"Twelve Thirty\" in a scene that already makes one feel unnerved.\n\nScript has the hard-boiled edge necessary and has entertainment and intensity. A word of warning, there is a lot of profanity (am mentioning this because this is something that bothers people) but to me it didn't feel as gratuitous as feared. Some pacing issues aside, the story is often absorbing and is quite nostalgic and daring with expert melding of fact and fiction. A few great scenes are everything to do with the making of the western with Rick and the girl (fans of classic-era westerns will enjoy it, likewise anybody with super fond memories of episodic television), Cliff's truly chilling encounter at the Spahn Movie Ranch and the splendidly over the top (and extremely violent just to warn you) finale in true Tarantino style.\n\nFound the characters to be interesting, with Rick and Cliff being quite meaty roles. The acting is exemplary, Leonardo DiCaprio is charisma and intensity personified and Brad Pitt, here the epitome of cool, has not been this good in years. Margot Robbie is absolutely radiant with a smile that lights up the screen. Bruce Dern, Damian Lewis and Al Pacino provide delicious support in small roles.\n\nIn conclusion, the odd pacing issue and one tasteless scene aside this was a great film. 9/10",

It was just depressing.  Pitt's character was more interesting and was at least fun to watch when there was something happening and it wasn't just a long scene of him driving in the car.  I like Margot Robbie, but they didn't give her anything to do.  Not much of a story here, especially not to justify a 2 hour and 40 minute run time.  The ending was the only part that engaged my attention.  I thought they would at least use original music of the period.  I'm not sure why they used mostly bland covers.  I view 1969 as the golden age.  This did not evoke any nostalgic feelings.   Tarantino's appeal is lost on me.",

The setting of 60's Hollywood is quite clever and allows our stars to pull off some wacky scenes. However, quirky characters and excellent chemistry can only get you so far, as the pacing is truly god awful, the first 3 quarters of this movie are slow as molasses with barely any plot development, and then once we actually get to the final act, it switches into its highest gear and blazes through it at the speed of light. Still, the final act of the movie is the best as it finally feels like something important is happening with even more funny interactions.

Sure, there is a maturity to this film that shows growth, and there's no doubting that this is a movie that is probably more personal to QT than his other endeavours, but it's a difficult one to compare to the rest of his back catalogue.\n\nIt's certainly not gritty like Resevoir Dogs, or as cult as Pulp Fiction. It's not as comedic as Jackie Brown. Overall, it doesn't enthrall like these movies.\n\nThere are times when the film becomes too long in the tooth. Scenes showing the acting on set of Rick Dalton at times feel needless and add little to the storyline. It also feels TOO restrained at times and really only nods to QTs more gloriously over-dramatic style towards the last 20 minutes.\n\nWhat is done well though is Quentin's ability to lead your thought process one way and then turn it around - or drop the idea dead. There are times when you think \"yeah, this will lead to ...\" Only to have there be no lead there at all.\n\nAlso done well is the usage of an all-star cast in bit parts without the appearances feeling like little Camo performances to bring a big name to a film. Again, truly a nod to the greatness of Tarantino in that he can bring in massive names for small parts and leave the audience fulfilled.\n\nYou have to watch this if you like to watch movies by Quentin Tarantino, but equally if you're a fan of any of the lead stars too. And if you're not, it's still a good film to watch.\n\nBut if you're looking for classic Tarantino with a lot of action and a storyline that makes you think hard - you're in for a bit of a shock.",

I'm good with all of that.  So much of what he does isn't even all that good, it's just weird - with great soundtracks and kitsch and casts and budgets.  And that's enough of a contrast to what we usually get, so I'm also good with that.  \nIt's a funny movie that I thoroughly enjoyed.  I was also a bit horrified at how well, and frequently, DiCaprio hocks loogies, and the dexterity with which he handles cigarettes, lighters, and the way he can hold and spew smoke on command almost like it's a dialogue unto itself.  It's literally physical comedy, loogies aside - that boy prob has a habit he doesn't need.  But gracious, he's good at it.  \nThere's almost a juvenile aspect to most Tarantino movies, that when added to big boy resources, just works.  I can enjoy some caricature.

I mean, I think everything at this point is largely derivative, I don't consider that a problem, just don't understand all the discrepancies in application.  \nMaybe this is Tarantino for the masses, I dunno, but I thought it was delightful and got a lot of laughs and enjoyment from it.

Next is the level of thought & creativity Tarantino put into the story line of the fictitious Western TV series \"Bounty Law\", that prefaces the decline of Rick Dalton's Hollywood career.  The movie puts enough \"hooks\" into this that I actually hope Tarantino does indulge his clearly well-thought out fantasy to make a real film or a pilot around \"Bounty Law\".  I for one would watch it!  Lastly, thanks Quentin for NOT running us through the real ending to the Sharon Tate story one more time.

Leo and Brad deliver some solid and hilarious performances, with a shining Margot Robbie giving a subtle and bright performance as Sharon Tate. The rest of the ensemble cast deliver some great performances in their limited screen time, with Austin Butler and Margaret Qualley delivering standout performances within the ensemble cast.

At 160+ mins it's a long trudge but the script probably only had few pages if compared with other movies of this length, why?... So many scenes are made up of shots of bods getting into cars, then long internal shot from back seat (lifted from the far better  Gun Crazy' 50s) then bods get out of car, long shots of feet walking, more bods get into cars, more long internal driving shot, bods again get out of car, more feet walking. This format is repeated from beginning to end \u2013pages of same--  The 60s heralded in a new low for movie making \u2013 features like; \u2018Beach Blanket Bingo', \u2018How to Stuff a Wild Bikini ', \u2018Sergeant Deadhead' were playing as main features across the land, el-cheapo's had become the new norm. What would usually have been a \u2018B' picture were now being sold as an \u2018A'. Yes. it may have helped a jaded Hollywood at that time but what about other mainstream audiences?\n\nSo, what might have influenced TQs fixation with this downturn in the social morays of movies? Tarantino grew up in the swinging \u201860s/mod \u201870s working in a porn cinema (this perhaps explains his addiction to perversity) including a video store - while also watching the endless re-runs of TV shows, along with an overflowing barrage of low budget, Spaghetti westerns that had flooded the market - thank goodness some audiences grew up (well, some did) and demanded better.  These endless \u2018homage's to days offering little more than cheap TV-style quickies -- now being released to the big screen --- with product that was generally catering for a guideless, acid tripping youth (such as the Manson crew, etc) wanting endless simple-minded partying. Hollywood producers loved it \u2013 now, for half the normal budgets, they were getting the same financial returns as quality features. \n\nQT has simply revived those days and a new \u2018comic book hero' generation have picked it up. Only this time round, the budgets are BIGGER while the contents remain juvenile, if not ridiculous. Trouble is, too many of today's producers and art critics also grew up in this overly comfortable, \u2018anything goes' era, so they wrap on about the glorious emptiness that's making them all rich. Some rave about the cinematography and design - with that much money being thrown about it's simple to \u2018copy' the work of previous Masters. But, no matter how expensively dressed-up and stylishly packaged rubbish maybe, it's still rubbish (but, GOOD-LOOKING rubbish). Too much you might be saying? Take a look back, revisit many of those poorly scripted, badly acted, TV shows and movies of the 50s-60s \u2013 the ones Q.T. tends to dote over...you may be surprised how your memory may have failed you as just how poor most were.  \n\nOnce U.A.T.I.H. looks like several proposed projects that never got off the ground all edited into one, and doesn't do justice to any of them. One or two characters and situations looked as if they may have been leading to something but simply fizzled out. How long might it take before more look back and ask, how were we so fooled?  Or is it just that LESS has now become the new MORE?\nSo, if this is Q.Ts 9th may there be only one left to go. Please.",

I had a slight idea what the movie was about, but I never bothered to dig deep into it before actually watching it. And since I believe I could've enjoyed it much more had I looked up the whole story prior, I highly recommend you do. It won't spoil the fun for you, it'll add up to it.\n\nSo I sat there, doing my best to just enjoy the movie instead of being too critical of it and looking too far into the scenes than I probably should, which certainly made for a better, more relaxed experience. The movie is long, and it being somewhat slow paced and patience demanding (which we're not always used to from Tarantino) could make it feel even longer, but if you're into that like I am, you know that's where the fun is at.\n\nI smiled effortlessly at most of the scenes (because they were just THAT good) and even laughed with some of them, but one thing is sure, in classic Tarantino fashion, the writing and dialogue were absolutely ON POINT.\n\nThe casting could not have been better, each actor portrayed their character to mere perfection and they felt more like actual people than in any other movie I've seen.\n\nThen comes the storyline, And I can't help but be a little biased here, seeing as my favorite movies are those that do nothing more than just tell you a story, the ones that make no effort to keep your attention. There's some events going on that you just have to follow, even if they feel like they're not leading to any peak or climax. This movie is a PRIME example of that. Perfect for people who like to get invested in a film rather than have it reward or gratify them.\n\nAnd then it ended, leaving me, and everyone there I'm sure, STUNNED by what we had just seen, by how brilliant it all was and wishing we could watch the whole thing over again, there and then.

Needless to say, I was oh-so-wrong. After the slow and deliberate build-up, in the last chapter of the movie you get treated to a very abrupt and jarring transition into Tarantino territory. And then when the credits roll, the next surprise to me was that the movie almost has a feel-good happy end.\n\nPerformances are top-notch, and without knowing much about the setting, the meticulous attention to detail is obvious.

Robbie doesn't have much to do of interest in comparison and her moments in the spotlight are certainly a change of pace, but still emanate the same amount of fun. The rest of the cast also shines at so many various point that they escape description.

The great fantastic phenomenal movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie. Sometimes you may feel that the movie is too long. But as you keep watching, the feeling of the movie is faster than you can imagine. Some scenes, I won't say which ones but they get brutal and kind like suspenseful and how the music sounds. Feel like you're in a horror movie which is weird but then you also feel like you're in a comedy then go to a drama. It's has everything feeling and has lots of fantastic scene. This movie has a ton of great actors that give a performance of a lifetime especially Brad Pitt. He's so enjoyable and also entertaining. In my opinion, he is better than Leonardo DiCaprio in this movie although Leo is in the movie more. But Brad Pitt's moments stand out more and more memorable. Margot Robbie to me felt like she having a role that is less attractive in the movie. I thought the movie would tie the three main characters together but they never did disappointing for me. (Spoiler alert!) The ending of the movie made me a little confused but Quentin Tarantino knows what he's doing and it's supposed to mean something so I'm intrigued. Overall, the movie is really good, it's fun, and there are a lot of feelings that make it perfect. This is definitely a great film and it is my second favorite Brad Pitt film of all time.",

Characters ride from one destination to the next in a sunny and vibrant 1960s wonderland accompanied by catchy songs and there are no clues as to what the audience can expect next story wise.  The fact that the movie doesn't try and bind the characters and narrative together allows it to blend fantasy and reality together in a highly organic way and the fluid transition between movie sets and real life locations and fictional movie scenes in a fictional movie are some of the obvious examples. The movie is funny and dramatic and wacky and touching and captivating and the take-away is that life is a story and we don't know what's around the corner and in those rare cases where we do get the satisfaction of knowing where a story is headed we're actually unlucky, because we'll never be surprised by it.",

The slice of life genre, I'd reply. Where setting takes top spot in terms of the overall story. Characters interact in interesting ways within the setting. And there really isn't much of a plot, certainly not like we would get from say a thriller or something. Not to mention there's not much special effects or action. In this movie the only action is from clips that are stitched in from movies that Rick Dalton starred in. Indeed, a movie like Inglorious Basterds seems like a giant successful production from the hollywood illustrated so finely in this movie. And that is the way that Tarantino does 'meta'. Back to the problematic Charlie Manson and his  cult of interesting hippie chicks and odd dog dudes. The movie ultimately ends with a climax that stems from this underdeveloped storyline- oddly missing the man himself, whose absence is not at all explained. Perhaps I might now wonder in Tarantino's what happens to Mr. Manson? But the audience probably wont wonder this because there is no hint, not even a subtle one, to wonder so. Indeed, what we come to realize is that there is a somewhat large bite size scene or two missing from this movie.",

            "content": "So, the first time I watched this film, I laughed all the way through.  The dialogue is hilarious, the situations are hysterical, and the big name actors are perfect in their portrayals.  The late 60's - early 70's is trademark Tarantino in any and every film he has ever done.  Exploitation-style Film & Television everywhere.   It's clear he is in love with both the Hollywood of his youth, and the last Hollywood of fantasy the USA ever knew.  By the 1980's, we were able to \"peak behind the curtain\", and all the mystique/PR/Bullshit was gone.\n\nThe second viewing, however, opened my eyes to enough nuance that I felt outright stupid in my initial reaction.  This film is an outright tragedy.  All the characters depicted are suffering and beyond salvation.  Everyone see DiCaprio at the end of his career.  Easy.  Everybody sees Pitt as tied to DiCaprio for whatever success he EVER had, include his present as a driver and \"gopher\".  What I missed the first time is Robbie's suffering; this woman goes to a movie theater ... staffed by people who do nothing except see movies ... and struggles to get their recognition.  Almost begs them to know who she is, naming film after film, role after role, and they never really know who she is.  Even though she is in the very film they are showing RIGHT NOW, they don't really know who she is.  When the booth girl ask for a photograph, she asks her to stand next to the poster so people will know who she is.\n\nThere is a massive subtext regarding the suffering and ultimate rejection by the vert people all of entertainment (Hollywood) are inextricably drawn toward; the fans.  On some level, the 21st century exploitation filmmaker of note created a fil.m that reveals how the real people the public claims to \"love\" are ultimately betrayed and abandoned by the very people they are trying to please, trying to gratify, trying so hard to win the acceptance and love of.  Us. The cussing-shooting-did-that-just-happen sensationalistic director actually gives an unflattering mirror reflection to the audience, exactly as Rick Dalton faces himself in his trailer, but there is no redemption for us.  Nothing like he finds by recommitting his-self to the role he has been cast in.\n\nThe central protagonist (Dalton) is cast in the role of the audience; An Evil Hamlet.",

Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is Quentin Tarantino unrestrained. There\u2019s excess all over this thing, from the unnecessarily long run-time to the constant bare feet shoved in front of the screen. This doesn\u2019t mean that he is so unhinged that the movie as a whole is a disaster. On the contrary, there are still some great elements in this film, despite its tendency to ramble on to a nearly exhausting degree. First and foremost, the acting is stellar. Brad Piitt is his usual charming self, and makes this stunt double into someone every guy would love to have as a friend. Leonardo DiCaprio is perfect as the actor struggling with the inevitable shift in his career from leading man/hero to supporting role/villain. As for how this movie handles the whole Manson family thing, I thought that was fine. It might have been more impactful to me if I was more knowledgeable about the history related to them, but I knew enough to appreciate this film and how it handled the historic tragedy. I genuinely loved the big climactic scene, and it\u2019s not just because this was the most interesting part of the film (since something of note was happening.) It has this cathartic wish-fulfillment quality that you don\u2019t see many other film-makers attempt. I only wish it felt more like the satisfying conclusion to a story, but there was so little structure to Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood. The entire thing felt like a series of small vignettes featuring a number of loosely-connected people, and then they all come together in the end for a big finish. It\u2019s one of those movies where I simply felt like things were happening rather than a story was being told, which is a pet peeve of mine. Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is definitely lower-tier Tarantino for me, even though it will be a favorite to others.",

With a mix of pure fiction and history, Tarantino builds tension by showing you the lives of the real life stars doomed to get caught up in Manson-family murders.  Sharon Tate is portrayed in uncanny fashion by Margot Robbie, whose talent and charm is ultimately under-utilized by Tarantino's script.  The film shows a commitment to long-winded and over-indulgent sequences that serve as love-letters to late 60s LA.

It was funny to see Brad kick Lee's ass which never happened; another what if event.

It's has everything, lots of gore in a particularly fantastic scene that I'll never forget and this movie has a ton of great actors that give a performance of a lifetime especially Brad Pitt, he's so entertaining and in my opinion is better than Leonardo DiCaprio in this movie even though Leo is in the movie more the Brad Pitt moments stand out more and are more memorable. Margot Robbie to me felt like she was kinda useless in the movie and I thought the movie would tie the three main characters together but spoiler alert they never did which is a little disappointing and the ending too is also I little disappointing but Quentin Tarantino knows what he's doing and it's supposed to mean something so I'm intrigued. If it was any other random director I would be furious but with Tarantino it's acceptable. I can't wait to see this movie again in the future and see what Quentin Tarantino does next.",

Actors had nothing to go off of and it's a slow burn until the last 20 minutes",

It's not something I do very often because I choose to watch the film first and then see what others felt. But \u2018Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' certainly divided opinion among critics and audiences alike, but for me I absolutely loved this film.\n\nEssentially, there isn't much of a plot and I won't go into detail for anyone how hasn't seen it yet, but what I took away from this was that it seems to be Tarantino's film on the Film industry. To be more specific the \u2018Golden Age' of Hollywood. That is what everyone has been saying and I couldn't agree more, because throughout the 2hrs 40 minutes of this, I wasn't bored at any point. Which many found themselves like when they watched it. The 3rd act possibly drags slightly but still enough to hold my attention. Brad Pitt and Leo DiCaprio's performances as stuntman Cliff Booth and Actor Rick Dalton received the acclaim they deserved, they were both phenomenal. Pitts supporting actor Oscar win was very much deserved in my opinion after seeing this. I can't really offer more than what people have already said. Margot Robbie's performance as Sharon Tate was acceptable, in a good way. I wouldn't say the inclusion of that character made the film what I thought it was, but it was a fine role that expanded the films narrative and it became relevant to the story. \n\nFinally, something that entertained me from start to finish and it has definitely become a positive through many of Tarantino's work is the soundtracks, and wow is this particular track a memorable one. Tracks such as \u2018California Dreamin', \u2018Hush' and \u2018Brothers Love Traveling Salvation Show' were the ones that made fall in love with the film even more, and for me how good or bad the soundtrack compliments the film, ultimately can make or break how the film is received and this was a truly brilliant score.\n\nSo overall, I loved \u2018Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' because it depicts the film industry in a fine era for cinema. And Tarantino shows just how much that era meant to him too. A very different Tarantino film, he shows his versatility here in abundance and for me, I would happily watch this over and over again. \n\nQuote - Hey! You're Rick fucking Dalton. Don't you forget it.\n\n9/10",

            "content": "Finally got to watch the latest Tarantino, ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD, and I have to say that I was a bit unimpressed. While I can't deny the obvious love for film that Quentin has, and especially for that time period, which was a true shift in the industry from a more care-free style of film, to a grittier, angrier, more inventive approach brought upon by the disillusion associated with Vietnam, the hippie movement and the Manson murders. The film portrays that end of innocence pretty well by following a popular actor on the decline, Rick Dalton (played with full-blown anguish by Leonardo DiCaprio) and his long-time partner, friend and stuntman, Cliff Booth (performed with perfect tough guy cockiness by Bad Pitt), a friendship that reminds one of the rapport between Burt Reynolds and stuntman Hal Needham. Their paths crosses the grimy ones set by the Manson family and Sharon Tate.\n\nSpeaking of Tate, I can't say that I cared much for her portrayal by Margot Robbie. Through no fault of her own, but hindered by her role being badly scripted as a vacuous flower child. If the intent was to make her the symbol of the innocence that is in danger of being destroyed, it's a bit too much on the nose.\n\nWhile there is the basis of a potentially fascinating story, Tarantino wallows in a bit too much of his self-indulgence, lingering too long o certain shots, and making sure he throws our way as many movie references as he can. Don't get me wrong; I'm a sucker for movies about movies, and I could have gone for more onset Hijinks by Booth and Dalton, especially the interlude in Italy hat could have been a movie by itself.\n\nThe Manson family moments could have brought a certain amount of tension to the film, but the whole flippancy expressed through every frame by Tarantino sabotages the stress we could have felt in those scenes.\n\nHe also goes back to his statement that a story beats History, and that the world is saved by art, by rewriting History like he did in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and DJANGO UNCHAINED. While it was refreshing and unexpected in BASTERDS, it has lost a bit of its impact by now.\n\nI know that I am going against the grain of many reviewers who are claiming it's a marvelous film, and I'll admit that I did fall in love with Brad Pitt's character enough that I would love to see other stories about him.\n\nI feel this one wasn't the best one to tell.",

Having to rely on narration to get the moviegoer to understand what is going on is not the type of movie he makes, but he couldn't get away from it.  In my opinion some of the best parts of his films are dialogs, intertwining story lines and bringing focus to the characters.  This film had none of that.  We are dragged through bits and pieces of forced character development, fragmented story lines, and a whole lot of going nowhere.  I'm sorry but if this film was made by an unknown filmmaker, I don't think anyone would be giving it good reviews (not even \"OK\" reviews).  Honestly this is like getting a really bad plate of food from a world famous chef, and reviewing that it was great based solely on the fact that it should have been great because of who made it.

The director does a brilliant job of recreating the 1960s pop culture iconography. His wide shots of busy main streets are visually stunning in the detail from billboards and movie posters, as vintage cars drive down the strip drenched in fluorescent neon lights against the dusk sky. Whereas vintage radio commercials for Heaven Sent perfume play in the background amongst the soundtrack ladled with supersonic sounds of the 60s. The director captures the period's sights and sounds so vividly, that the 60s Los Angeles backdrop feels incredibly lived in.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio (The Beach) delivers a fantastic performance as Rick Dalton, an insecure star who is on the decline. However, the feature belongs to Brad Pitt (12 Monkeys). As Cliff Booth, he's charming and incredibly fun to watch. Pitt brings a certain energy to each scene that keeps your eyes glued to the screen, waiting for his next move. Especially during the incredibly tense scene at Spahn Ranch. Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn: Birds Of Prey) is almost magical playing the actress Sharon Tate. Many critics bemoaned Robbie's dialogue-light portrayal of Tate. However, one could argue Once Upon A Time In Hollywood captures Tate's wholesomeness. Instead of being associated with death and macabre, Tate's life should be celebrated for the beautiful soul she was.\n\nUpon release Once Upon A Time In Hollywood was billed as Tarantino's tale about the harrowing Manson-family murders. A home invasion nightmare that brought an end to the \"Summer of Love\" on August 9th 1969. Knowing this, there's a state of tension that lingers throughout. However, like Inglorious Basterds (2009), the historical record is used as a mere springboard for the directors fevered Imagineering. Tarantino takes the same route here inverting history, with Rick and Cliff turning the tables on the Manson family killers. The prolonged \"What if?\" violent finale is brutal and unapologetically satisfying. \n\nOverall, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is a solid addition to Quentin Tarantino's filmography and serves as an ode to the golden age of Hollywood. The combination of fictional characters and real-life figures weave a revisionist tale around the event that arguably signalled the end of the \"Summer of Love\". It's more tender than the director's previous entry The Hateful Eight (2015), but still possesses most of the director's trademark shocking touches.",

In this film, Tarantino wraps himself in the allure of 1969 Los Angeles pretending that he has something to say about aging actors or random cult violence. But he really doesn't. If you break down the movie - the Tate story is only there to provide a 3rd act climax where villains that can be shot, mauled, bashed and burned alive. Otherwise, it really serves no purpose other than adding atmosphere and context to a somewhat drab main plot. The Rick Dalton main plot is just another rehash of stories we've seen before about a bad aging actor who's being pushed out of the business. Yeah it's Leo and Brad Pitt. So what? As Shania would say, \"that don't impress me much.\"\nAs always, it's interesting to see how Tarantino breaks convention - like having a flashback inside a flashback - but if you're not a film nerd, this film may not be to your liking.  Overall, it's somewhat entertaining. But not the masterpiece that the lemming critics would have you believe. If you got nothing better to do for 3 hours, then go for it.

Didn't quite get it or what it was about in all honesty but the 60s nostalgia was in overdrive and a great soundtrack to boot keep your eyes and ears from wandering for too long...and there are certain parts of the film that will test you...but in my experience all of Tarantino's films do that at times...That been said some clever scenes and found myself laughing at times as well so the comedy is there...the ending was unforeseen and really quite funny...the verdict watch this film when you want to appreciate good acting and clever script writing...when you want to be impressed by the clever minds that put stories together...if your feeling tired and dont feel like concentrating on the screen...I'd save it for another day",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino likes happy endings. He likes them so much, in his imagination, he goes back in time and preemptively obliterates people responsible for history's nightmares, like the Holocaust, and the Manson Family murders which, for Quentin at least, did irreparable harm to the innocent chilled-out mood of Hollywood in 1969. \n\nIn Tarantino's repaired world (called \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\") Clint Eastwood (or someone much like him) never became a bitter old curmudgeon arguing with a chair. Instead, he got cast in Roman Polanski movies mid-career and got to go to more parties and keep his chauffeur and personal stunt double. And the cool mood in Hollywood never got overrun by dirty hippies with no cars and their awful political correctness. \n\nOh, people still get murdered in Quintin's world, but this time it's the right people: the political people, the radicals, the Nazis and people who will become Nazis, the people who will start killing if they haven't already. And this time the good guys win with every imaginable act of violence. The dirty hippies get mauled by dogs, smashed to a bloody pulp and charred by flames - just the sort of happy ending to make us all laugh and cheer. \n\nWhen I saw \"Inglourious Basterds\" I was struck by the irony of a scene within a scene: me sitting in a theater of people laughing at a revenge fantasy where Hitler is burned up with a bunch of Nazis as they sit in a theater laughing at a violent propaganda film about a German sniper endlessly shooting Allied soldiers from a clock tower until dead bodies are piled up. As flames envelope the screen I thought to myself \"this is moral hell and Tarantino is holding up a mirror and showing his audience how they are like the Nazis delighting in righteous violence on the movie screen.\"\n\nAt the time I thought that this irony was intentional and Tarantino's \"Basterds\" movie was a clever morality play about the dangers of \"preemptive war.\" I'm not so sure now. Perhaps Tarantino likes the idea of killing the bad people before they get a chance to kill us. And maybe he knows who should be allowed to pick the bad people: filmmakers (the old fashioned Hollywood kind), and actors who are childlike and innocent, and their no-foolishness stunt doubles who don't care about politics or activism. Or maybe the audience should decide what's fair in Movies and War. \n\nThe only characters in \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" (set in 1969) who say anything about the Vietnam War or inequality or politics are the criminally insane Charles Manson family members. Everybody else could care less about poverty or inequality - as they float in their pools and dance at the Playboy mansion - because they are the beautiful and harmless people who create the escapism of movies! Tarantino seems to be saying that Hollywood got ruined by politics and undue attention to the private lives of its creative flower children.\n\nIt's hard not to see \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" as a subtle jab at the Me Too movement. Brad Pitt plays a likable guy who, it is said, \"killed his wife and got away with it.\" But when an underage girl tries to seduce him he dutifully turns her down. Evidently Hollywood has a young girl problem. Roman Polanski is glamorized as the jet setting genius who made \"Rosemary's Baby.\" Al Pacino plays a movie producer and kindly old-world father figure named Marvin Schwarzs (in contrast to Harvey Weinstein who produced most of Tarantino's movies). Sharon Tate, played by Margot Robbie, is the only sweet and likable woman in the movie. She's almost angelic. All the others are either nagging wives, Feminazis or underage jail-bate. The near exception is one 8 year old actress (she prefers to be called an \"actor\"). Yet even she takes issue when Leo Dicaprio's character calls her \"pumpkin puss.\"\n\nFor all it's mystifying detail, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is still a feast for the senses and a charming piece of nostalgia. Watching DiCaprio's insecure TV star character, Rick Dalton, melt down alone in his trailer after botching a scene is priceless. It may be Tarantino's most self-assured and well crafted movie to date. The violent finale plays like Three Stooges slapstick, and again, I found myself laughing at a woman getting her head smashed in, and another woman being burned up by a tool-shed flame thrower (left over from a previous movie). Remember, in the context of this movie, the Manson Family hasn't killed anyone, yet somehow Hollywood's grooviest times were rescued by the opportune violent killing of some hippies in place of Sharon Tate.\n\nOne has to wonder does Quentin Tarantino want us to reflect on these details or to just lighten up and laugh them off? I can't tell.",

The stars \u2b50\ufe0f Rick Dolten (Played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double Cliff Booth (Played by Brad Pitt) with Sharon Tate (played by Margot Robbie) and their agent Marvin Schwarz (Played by Al Pacino) everyone does an amazing job in their respective roles ( especially Leo in his trailer which I bet Quentin told him I'm gonna leave the camera \ud83d\udcf8 on for ten minutes here are some guidelines go nuts \ud83e\udd5c). Do I even need to explain why the cinematography was great it's Tarantino forte to shoot compelling dialogue scenes even if they're talking about something that doesn't relate to the overall plot? Speaking of which the writing \u270d\ufe0f and directing is great \ud83d\udc4d but I will admit that some scenes do drag on a bit too long and the film really picks up in the end but that's just a nitpick. The end while not giving anything away Tarantino has doubled down and ones again made violence a cartoon and the whole audience and I couldn't stop laughing \ud83d\ude1d \ud83d\ude06 \ud83d\ude02 all the way through. Overall I think \ud83e\udd14 this will rankings this out of all of Quentin's filmography I would rank it at number 5 behind Django Unchained, Inglorious Basterds, Kill Bill vol1, Jackie Brown, and Pulp Fiction but definitely ahead of Reservoir Dogs, The Hateful Eight, Kill Bill vol2, and Death Proof \ud83d\udc80Hey just gave you all a top 9 list, I'll give out my full top ten when he's 10th and the final film comes out and I give it a 9/10.",

Imagine watching a Guy Ritchie film, but it's not funny or entertaining and none of the characters or storylines intersect.  What's the point?  I have to imagine whoever approved this at Columbia pictures was demoted.\n\nIt feels as if I spent nearly 3 hours inside Tarantino's head as he performed auto-fellatio while fantasizing about the hollywood of yore.  I really do appreciate period pieces and that this was meant to be some kind of nostalgic \"ode to old hollywood\" as it transitioned into the 70s, but good lord this was awful.

            "content": "Real Rating: 77.5/100\nCritics love Tarantino because he loves cinema and they can associate with that, and they get all of his references, which can be lost on your average viewer. It is the same reason movies set in LA often get a few noms or wins during Oscar season that many would call questionable. This is not to detract from Tarantino's talent. The man is a great writer, though as of late he has become a blowhard. Scripts are long and drawn out, and then they all crash into an ending that seems tacked on rather than built to which begs the question does he even know where he is going with his films anymore. It is not visionary, it is repetitive and showing very little sign of growth. He is a craftsman who carves an excellent movie each time, but they are more or less the same.\n\nDE: Tarantino runs a decent ship, and Hollywood is no different. Everything seems to be on point. Every department is hitting its marks, and we are building a tale in his distinct (if that is the right word) style. In terms of editing, the loss of Sally Menke can be felt in every one of his films since she passed. She somehow was able to contain him and give a better structure. Though from seeing her works outside of the Tarantino verse, you can see he had an equal part in elevating her. Together they were able to take his longwinded approach and make it come off with a steady pace and allow decent investment from the audience, but now however that is slipping away at a fast pace with each subsequent film.\n\nW: Tarantino is one of the great writers, he is not on Miyazaki's or Anderson's level, but he is undoubtedly on the same level as the Coen brothers or Bong Joon-ho. Which is not a level to sniff at, but the problem with Tarantino's writing is that he may have switched genres, but he has not adapted to it. More that he has made another Tarantino movie with a new shell on it. Which is great, but if I wanted to see the same thing as before I might as well watch the classics. It is sort of like a band doing a new tour 20 years later trying to flog the new stuff that sounds far too similar to the old stuff, and the fans would much rather prefer to hear the hits.\n\nC: Have you seen a Tarantino, Scorsese or Oliver Stone movie? Then guess what you have seen Robert Richardson's work and along with it some iconic shots that have littered avatars and uni students bedrooms for decades. His outing this time is impressive, though it might not match a level that he created. That said the lens seems to tell more of a story here than Tarantino's writing, which tells you everything you need to know.\n\nA: Acting is stereotypically cartoonish, but that has become a standard for Tarantino. Though Pitt's depiction of the more sane character throughout this 2D world of actors stands out. Sadly given the cast, we are working with, and the sheer level of talent coupled with the extent in which we examine these characters lives it feels underwhelming, and each one is more an allegory than a persona in their own right.\n\nS: As strange as it seems the sound department is usually one of the reasons I watch a Tarantino film. Since Inglourious Basterds someone in the sound department is getting an Oscar nom, whether it is music, mixing or editing. Without fail Hollywood continues this trend. Just excellent.\n\nPD: This film is not pretending to be the 1960s, it is the 1960s. I know you have seen many a period piece, and they all do a decent job, but it is the subtle nuances and the dirt that make the difference. This is not a glossy veneer trying to rewrite a section of history, this is just trying to capture an era for better or worse. This may be down to the fact that Tarantino is obsessed with the period and only a slight glance at his oeuvre would back this notion up.\n\nBA: The costume design, while simple is also great, it catches the style of the era without feeling like it is overexaggerating the form or the zeitgeist of the time. The visual effects in the latter portion of the film while jarring are quite well done and stand out.\n\nEVO: It is not one of Tarantino's \"funner\" films, which is odd given that it is a bright nostalgia backed film told from the perspective of mostly positive souls. If you are a Tarantino completest, you are going to want to see it, but for many, the question of why did I sit through that for 3 hours will ring true on the lips, and while the film is crafted brilliantly I cannot help but finding myself siding with them.",

Every scene is basically a vignette short story that could stand on its own, and if there is any flaw in the movie, that's probably it.

It's possible that the average movie goer will overlook  some of the little bits of ubiquitous humor and nostalgia, and if so, the movie could feel slow, and perhaps even boring.

I was going to save this one for a while yet, but...the preview had Brad Pitt doing his western tang drawl and...it rained here, so...damn I'm glad I bought this movie today. It was so worth it, and it was like a good read. You put it on the shelf and pull it out when you really need it. Also, okay, never mind, nobody spoiled this one for me, no one gave me a clue, so I'm not going to do it to you by explaining what, exactly, it has in common with \"Inglorious Basterds,\" and don't mean Brad Pitt doing the drawl which reminds me of my Missouri relations. How can I say it and keep from ruining the story for those that haven't read it yet?  Look. Mr. Tarantino will occasionally present a revisionistic take on a historical subject that gives those who suffered vicariously, a relief valve that I, for one, never knew I needed until I got it.",

Once again, he has made an enjoyable, overlong and seemingly pointless re-imagining (think Inglorious Bastards, Hateful 8, etc) that pervades his private fantasies, instead of an original narrative.\n\nOf course, 1969 featured Woodstock and Altamont, but the Manson killings was the quintessential, bleak end of that exciting decade. And here, Tarantino imagines a clear clash between early 1960's macho culture confronting a debased late 1960's hippie disaster, with the macho culture coming out on top. With both Pitt and DiCaprio on top form as a tough stunt man (think Clint Eastwood) and fading, insecure Western star (no obvious parallel I know of), most of the film seems to be wallowing in their relationship. But the real story is the scheduled murder of next store neighbour Sharon Tate by the Manson crazies in August. We are waiting for it - how will Tarantino deal with it? It will be gruesome that's for sure. But what do these macho neighbours have to do with it?\n\nWell, that's the real tale. What if the Manson family made a slightly different turn and missed Terry Melcher's old house and invaded Leo and Brad's pad? Quite a different outcome from the real story. The blood bath was on the other foot, with the macho boys dispensing ruthless frontier justice on the home invaders.\n\nDespite the length, I found it captivating, weird, beautiful and disgusting all at the same time. The message was clear - if drug crazed hippies are out to kill you, a couple of tough guys with a pit bull and a flame thrower will save you from a fate worse than Covid-19.\n\nNot a perfect film, but a wildly enjoyable romp.",

It's not inaccessible to people who didn't live through the '60's as written in some media reviews, because if that were true, all of the films I've watched & enjoyed that were set in the Stone Age (Quest For Fire), the Roman Empire (I Claudius), the Middle Ages (Marketa Lazarova) the 16th, 17th, 18th (Jane Austin's \"Emma\" or \"Pride and Prejudice\") 19th (\"Wuthering Heights\") centuries & the complete 20th century (everything), wouldn't have been relatable to or understood by me. I wasn't bored by THOSE films because I'm a reader. I had a good public education. I strived for the best grades I could get in K through 12, I didn't drop out or ignore my teachers during class and I did my homework. I went to college by working from age 14, saved every penny, got huge loans that took me 30 years to pay off, & I received a good education that required me to read, read, read, & learn from my instructors & professors how to interpret those books, whether text books or novels or non-fiction writings. It expanded my brain so that I am able to do the same thing with movies, so I'm not bored by them. I can enjoy movies that are really well crafted like this one. This film is the work of an evolving director, who didn't \"make up a stupid boring long thing with too much talking about something that didn't even happen that way\" (I'm not quoting anyone. I'm combining all of the negatives I've read/heard everywhere into one paraphrase). He gave us a \"what if\", & nice \"if only\". It's not boring. Tons of funny things happen in short bursts throughout the film & are cleverly brought back together in that final blast that is the ultimate Tarantinoed \"what if\" that pays homage to Sharon Tate & the others who were tortured & killed by the Manson Family. It might disappoint a Tarantino fan who has not yet matured at the same rate. It might be better later, with more accrued observation/thinking skills.",

            "content": "I remember going to the film rental store as a kid once every month, and by that time it was very odd for a kid my age to rent movies such as \u2018Taxi Driver' \u2018Psycho' etc. instead of early 2000s kids movies. And I remember that time when my mother bought me a 35mm film print for \u2018Pulp Fiction' because we had a 35mm projector that we never used. I started watching \u2018Pulp Fiction' once every week, and that's how I knew about the legendary director Quentin Tarantino. In 2019, Columbia Pictures released Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.\n\n  Tarantino's 9th film is perhaps the most -Tarantino-esque- of all his movies to date, it's a love letter to Hollywood and cinema. The film is packed with great characters, memorable locations of 1960's LA, spectacular writing, perfect production design, amazing cinematography and Tarantino's unorthodox great directing techniques. The film consists of something from every Tarantino film starting from long car rides, (spaghetti) westerns, WW2 adventures, martial arts to Tarantino's grindhouse style.\n\nIn terms of story, actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo Di Caprio) a serious drinker, who once were a successful star for a very successful TV show called \u2018Bounty Law' is watching his film career diminishing and he's starting to play the bad guy (supporting roles) against new coming talents, while having breakdowns on set. It's also about his stunt double and best friend Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) who were described as \"A buddy who's more than a brother and a little less than a wife\", Cliff is a formal green beret in WW2, whose Hollywood's career diminishing as well since Dalton is not getting any roles, so he's just Dalton's drinking partner and he drives him around since Dalton driving's license was taken away for too many drunk driving tickets. It's about the beautiful Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) a rising Hollywood star who lives with her husband Roman Polanski (Hollywood's best director by that time) next door to Dalton on Cielo Drive, which makes Dalton questions himself if he might be one pool party away to star in the next Polanski film to revive his acting career. The story leads to the miserable night of 8 August, 1969 when the violence of the Manson Family happens (The day the Manson Family kill Sharon Tate in real life).\n\n\nThe first act starts when Rick and Cliff went to Musso & Frank Grill to meet Dalton's agent Marvin Shwarz (Al Pacino) where Shwarz tells Dalton the ugly truth, that he has to go to Italy and starts starring in Spaghetti Westerns instead of playing the bad guy in Hollywood because that'd bring down his career even more. When Rick and Cliff left the restaurant, Rick kept on crying and cussing because his agent told him that he must go to Italy, Cliff then takes Rick home to study his lines from a show that he'll be acting in the next day while drinking margaritas in his pool. After Cliff drops off Dalton at his fancy house in Cielo drive, he parks Dalton's 1966 Cadillac Coupe de Ville and takes his 1964 Volkswagen Karmann Ghia and goes home, when Booth arrives home aka a dirty trailer next to Van Nuys Drive-In Brandy his dog was waiting impatiently for Cliff to come back home so he can feed her from the Rat flavored canned food while making mac n' cheese for himself. At the same, the rising star Sharon Tate goes to a party at the Playboy Mansion with her husband Roman Polanski who were with their friends including actor Steve McQueen.\n\nAct two starts when Cliff picks up Rick in the morning to take him to his film set, where Dalton was absolutely hungover. When they arrive on set, Cliff asks Rick if he can be his stunt double on this show but Rick told him that the stunt coordinator is friends with someone named Randy who once had a problem with Cliff, and then he told Booth to go back and fix his roof antenna. While fixing Rick's roof antenna, Cliff remembers this and a flashback begins, the flashback starts when Rick was filming an episode of \u2018The Green Hornet' and Randy (Kurt Russel) is in charge of stunts, the scene starts inside Rick's trailer on set where he asks Randy to hire Cliff because he likes working with him. Randy explains that he doesn't like Cliff because he killed his wife; at this point, another flashback starts where we see Cliff, drunk on a shaky boat with his nagging wife Billie (Rebecca Gayheart) as she fights him, Tarantino frames the scene where we only see Cliff holding a fishing harpoon angled align with Billie, so I guess we could imagine what happens next. Randy then decides to hire Cliff but he told him not to get near to his wife Janet (Zoe Bell) because she hates him. Cliff then goes on set where Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) giving a speech about martial arts saying that he'd beat Muhammad Ali, Cliff laughs and grabs Lee's attention and got him furious which made Bruce ask Cliff for a friendly martial arts contest to see who's going to win, Cliff ends up throwing Bruce on a car on set that led to smashing it, the car happened to be Janet's which got her very angry so she kicked Cliff off set. Then we go back to Cliff on Rick's roof approving to why he didn't get the job. Meanwhile, Cliff was suspecting someone who just entered Cielo Drive, which happened to be Charles Manson (Damon Herriman).\n\nIn the same time, Rick was in the makeup trailer where he met the show's director Sam Wanamaker (Nicholas Hammond) who wanted him to look as a hippie because that's how successful actors looked like by that time. Rick then goes to the Bad Guy's salon where the scene takes place, Rick then meets a kid on set Trudi Fraser (Julia Butters), who was even more charismatic than rick was. Rick starts telling her about the book that he has been reading and starts crying because it has the same story as his acting career. The other scene takes us to Rick acting on the show where he keeps forgetting his lines and embarrassing himself even more, after that Rick went to his trailer for a memorable jump cut scene where he kept shouting and breaking the glass, then he made a promise to himself that he'll go back and get the job done. After some phenomenal acting from Rick, Trudi went to him and told him that this was the best acting she ever saw in her whole life, Rick then started crying because he was so happy.\n\nIn the same time, Sharon went to Hollywood Boulevard to buy a gift for her husband, until she saw her film's poster \u2018The Wrecking Crew' in one of the theaters, so she decided to go in and watch the film. Meanwhile, Cliff was driving around when he saw Pussycat (Margaret Qualley) a hippie girl that Cliff has been seeing for two days, she asked him to take her where she lives at the Spahn Ranch (which was a movie ranch in late 1940s to early 1960s, that is now a place for the hippies aka the Manson Family). When Cliff arrives at Spahn Ranch with Pussycat he started noticing some changes, and then he asked everyone if George Spahn (Bruce Dern) still lives here until he forcefully enters his house where he had a sharp conversation with Squeaky (Dakota Fanning) who was the responsible for the place after Charles Manson. After she made him enter the house, she tells him that George is now blind so he must tell him who he is; this scene was the most suspenseful scene in the whole film, which ended with a funny conversation between Cliff and George. Cliff then beats one of the hippies for cutting Rick's tire and made him fix it. At the end of the day, Cliff picks up Rick from set and takes him home, the two of them decide to have a movie night to watch an episode that Rick acted in; in the same time, Marvin Shwarz was watching the episode while calling an Italian director to tell him to open TV and watch Rick's part.\n\nAct three starts 6 months later when Rick and his new Italian wife Francesca Capucci (Lorenzo Izzo) are on an airplane going back to LA alongside with his partner Cliff Booth, after having a successful acting career in Italy. Meanwhile, Sharon Tate is now very pregnant spending her day with three of her houseguests \u2013 Voytek Frykowski (Costa Ronin), Abigail Folger (Samantha Robinson) and her best friend Jay Sebring (Emile Hirsch) while her husband Roman Polanski was out of town. At night Sharon and her friends go out for dinner at the Mexican restaurant El Coyote. Meanwhile, after getting back to the house from the airport, Cliff picks up his dog Brandy, Rick putting jetlagged Francesca to bed; Rick and Cliff also head out to a Mexican Restaurant Casa Vega. Around 10pm Sharon and her friends went back to her house in Cielo Drive, while Rick and Cliff decided to go back home to continue their night.\n\nMeanwhile, three of the Mansion family were in Cielo Drive getting ready to murder Sharon Tate (that's what happened in real life) but this time, Rick confronts them about disturbing the neighborhood with their busted muffled car. After that, the followers of the Mansion Family decides break into Dalton's house instead, but they were surprised to find Cliff, who's gotten high off an acid-dipped cigarette, but somehow he remembered them from the day he went to Spahn Ranch; this is where the TARANTINO-ESQUE VIOLENCE ending occurs, with the help of Cliff's Pitbull, Cliff fights them off, eventually killing Tex Watson (Austin Butler) and Patricia Krenwinkel (Madisen Beaty) (Long story) in a party of violence that recalls the blood soaked ending of \u2018Django Unchained' and \u2018Inglourious Basterds'. On the other hand, Dalton burns Atkins in the pool with her flamethrower (the one he used in his film \u2018The 14 Fists of McCluskey'). The cops were called to pick up the dead bodies, and then Rick receives what he's been wishing for the entire film, an invitation to have a drink with Sharon Tate. Could this be the pool party Rick has been wishing for so he could rise again?\n\nWho else other than Tarantino would change history and give Sharon Tate another summer to live? Who else other than Tarantino would include a total of 5 minutes of car rides where Cliff drives around Hollywood Boulevard, flawless music when he played \u2018Mrs. Robinson' when Cliff first met Pussycat (Margaret Qualley), Barbara Ling's perfect production design who won an Oscar for that film and Robert Richardson's flexible camerawork and his nostalgic warmth cinematography.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood, probably the best Tarantino film that has ever been made.",

            "content": "In February 1969, veteran Hollywood actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), star of 1950s Western television series Bounty Law, fears his career is waning. Casting agent Marvin Schwarz (Al Pacino) recommends he make Spaghetti Westerns in Italy, which Dalton feels are beneath him. Dalton's best friend and stunt double, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) \u2014 a war veteran skilled in hand-to-hand combat who lives in a tiny trailer with his pit bull, Brandy \u2014 drives Dalton around Los Angeles because Dalton's driver's license has been suspended due to DUI. Booth struggles to find stunt work in Hollywood because of rumors he murdered his wife. Actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and her husband, director Roman Polanski, have moved next door to Dalton. He dreams of befriending them to revive his declining acting career. That night, Tate and Polanski attend a celebrity-filled party at the Playboy Mansion. The next day, while repairing Dalton's TV antenna, Booth reminisces about a sparring contest he had with Bruce Lee on the set of The Green Hornet which resulted in Booth being fired. Meanwhile, Charles Manson stops by the Polanski residence looking for music producer Terry Melcher, who used to live there, but is turned away by Jay Sebring (Emile Hirsch)...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Thrillingly unrestrained yet solidly crafted, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood tempers Tarantino's provocative impulses with the clarity of a mature filmmaker's vision.\" The Hollywood Reporter said critics had \"an overall positive view,\" with some calling it \"Tarantino's love letter to '60s L.A.,\" praising its cast and setting, while others were \"divided on its ending.\" ReelViews' James Berardinelli awarded the film 3.5 stars out of 4, saying it was \"made by a movie-lover for movie-lovers. And even those who don't qualify may still enjoy the hell out of it.\" RogerEbert.com's Brian Tallerico gave it four out of four stars, calling it \"layered and ambitious, the product of a confident filmmaker working with collaborators completely in tune with his vision\". The Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper described it as \"a brilliant and sometimes outrageously fantastic mash-up of real-life events and characters with pure fiction,\" giving it full marks. Writing for Variety, Owen Gleiberman called it a \"heady engrossing collage of a film\u2014but not, in the end, a masterpiece.\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave it five out of five stars, praising Pitt and DiCaprio's performances and calling it \"Tarantino's dazzling LA redemption song.\" Steve Pond of TheWrap said: \"Big, brash, ridiculous, too long, and in the end invigorating, the film is a grand playground for its director to fetishize old pop culture and bring his gleeful perversity to the craft of moviemaking.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded the film 4.5 out of 5 stars, remarking that \"All the actors, in roles large and small, bring their A games to the film. Two hours and 40 minutes can feel long for some. I wouldn't change a frame.\" The film also garnered moral and theological praise. The Los Angeles Catholic Bishop Robert Barron praised the character of Cliff Booth as embodying the four cardinal virtues, while the theologian David Bentley Hart wrote that the film \"exhibit[s] a genuine ethical pathos, one that actually brought tears to my eyes\" for its portrayal of \"cosmic justice.\" Specifically, Hart praised the revisionism when \"Tarantino's version of the story unexpectedly veered away into some other, dreamlike, better world, where the monsters inadvertently passed through the wrong door and met the end they deserved\" that \"gave glorious expression to a perfectly righteous rage\" in \"some other order of reality, if only an imaginary one, where ethereal sweetness had survived and horror had perished.\"\n\nQuentin Tarantino's ninth film \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\" I think personally is more or less numbingly boring with endless dialogue, no proper character development and a missing core storyline. Yes, there's something intriguing as well in it, the cinematography is visually stunning, it has a good comment on becoming a Hollywood has been, it's set in a nice timeperiod and the soundtrack rocks. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are solid while Robbie gets nothing to work with and hardly any screen time. However, the ending is a nice wink to how we all wish reality would've pan out in 1969. It\u00b4s a classic absurd and violent Tarantino ending. That part I did like. But, \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\" is not amongst his best features. I think he is running on empty at this point in his career. There\u00b4s not gas left. \n\nTrivia: The movie can be seen as revisionist fiction, with several made-up characters interacting with existing ones, thereby changing the course of real-life history. In this case, the infamous Sharon Tate murders by members of Charles Manson's 'Family' are disrupted by the presence of Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). The film accurately shows Charles Manson (Damon Herriman) visiting Tate's house early in the film, looking for music producer Terry Melcher (the previous renter) because he felt that Melcher owed him the record deal that he was once promised. Frustrated that Melcher no longer lived there, Manson instructed four of his followers to go to the house six months later, to incite a slaughter. The four indeed drove over there, briefly parked on the driveway to cut the phonelines to Tate's house, then proceeded to park the car at the bottom of the hill, went back to the house on foot and killed five people (Tate, three of her friends who happened to be at the house, and one friend who just came visiting). Probably the first significant point of divergence between the real and fictional account is the fact that Dalton notices the four as they are parked on the driveway. He gets out, verbally abuses them and sends them away. This angers Tex (Austin Butler) and the three women to the point where they decide to come back and invade Dalton's house instead. This incident also causes the woman called Flowerchild (Maya Hawke) to get cold feet, and leave with the car (in real life, this was Linda Kasabian, who accompanied the others all the way but did not participate in the killings). In the end, the fatal mistake on the part of the killers is invading Dalton's house, not counting on the resistance of Booth and his dog, and Dalton himself.",

            "content": "An increasingly irrelevant television actor, Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his out of work stunt double, Cliff Booth (Pitt) strive to achieve fame and success in the film industry as Hollywood's Golden Age comes to an end. Tarantino crafts yet another masterclass in classic film making technique and ever engaging dialogue in this stylish revisionist history of 1960s L.A. \n\nTarantino is without a doubt one of the most skilful directors working today and he surrounds himself with a very talented cast and crew who are all working brilliantly in this his ninth film. The cinematography by Robert Richardson strikes a clever balance between modern camera movement and a more classical filmmaking style paying homage to films from the 50s and 60s with plenty of long wide takes showing off the wonderful work from production designer Barbara Ling and costume designer Arianne Phillips. The design feels both stylish and tactile, Tarantino's preference for real sets, cars and props over CGI environments gives the film's setting weight and character which perfectly captures the feeling of Hollywood in this era. Edited by Fred Raskin the film clocks in at 161 minutes. It doesn't strictly follow a traditional three act structure and often indulges in scenes which do little to advance the plot or characters, but despite the slower pace it is consistently entertaining. \n\nThe acting on display is all excellent as you would expect from such an A-list cast. DiCaprio brings a lot of charisma to a mean and self-obsessive alcoholic. Pitt manages to make his character likeable despite being lazy and violent with a questionable past. If those characters show the fall of the Golden Age of Cinema Margot Robbie in her small role as Sharon Tate represents a more innocent and romanticised past for Hollywood, something authentically optimistic. These characters have little in the way of character growth and Tarantino avoids making judgement on their motivations and actions thus the film functions more as a well-crafted snapshot of old Hollywood and is less a story about characters or theme. \n \nThe film will not be to everyone's taste, it is long and slow paced, it doesn't have a typical protagonist versus antagonist dynamic, and it doesn't offer satisfying character arcs. There is also the trade-mark Tarantino violence which is always a point of contention for audiences. But it is a highly entertaining, expertly crafted unique film that draws you into its world with a great sense of atmosphere and attitude.",

You definitely cannot accuse Tarantino of writing bad dialogue, and he's a great director technically, but there's little thematic depth.

Brad Pitt's Cliff Booth is no doubt my favorite character; I love his calm, collected badassery.  The performances were all good at least, but none great or award-worthy.  Even the dialogue was nothing to ride home about, which is a department Quentin normally excels in.  Nothing special happens throughout the movie.  It's shot well, has the signature Tarantino soundtrack filled with classic throwbacks, and the climactic bloody showdown in Dalton's house against the Manson members was decently entertaining to watch, but aside from that this entire movie was a bit of a let down.  I liked the somewhat love letter to classic Hollywood cinema that's spread throughout the movie via iconic actors and characters from the past as well as the impressive re-creation of the 60's time period.  Overall, this wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.  I've no desire to revisit this as opposed to his earlier, greater works(not including Death Proof).",

Quentin Tarantino has a gift and a clear passion for crafting each of the worlds presented in all of his films, and this movie is no exception. Each scene is expertly shot and acted in ways only many movies could dream of. Brad Pitt, and Leonardo DiCaprio give excellent performances as the movies two leads, and I was rooting for them throughout, their chemistry and charisma in the film is great, and they left me smiling all the way through. Margot Robbie also shines in this film as Sharon Tate. I have only ever had the chance to see her as Harley Quinn, so seeing her play a different role, and doing it so well was a real treat for me, as she really is a very talented actress. This movie is surprisingly funnier than I expected, Tarantino really does have a gift for blending drama, and dark humor masterfully, and I was enthralled at the way that I found humor even in moments where any other film would never dream of going in that direction with that topic or tone. I loved how this film was an entire love letter to Hollywood and its golden age, and I enjoyed picking out each iteration of Easter Egg for both the history of Hollywood, as well as a few I found referencing the careers of some of the films actors as well. I don't have much that I disliked about this movie, they are nitpicks at best, and I am sure that I am in the minority on them which is fine, these are just my opinions. The one that I do have is simply that I felt that at one point in the movie they play up a certain character that Brad Pitt spends some time with as more important than they appear to be later on in the film. I felt that they should have played this up a bit more and made them a part of the climax later on in the movie. All in all take what I say with a grain of salt, this is just a minor nitpick after all, and in the the long run does not diminish how awesome this movie truly is! I give Once Upon a Time In Hollywood a 9.5/10!",

Unlike his other films, \"Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood\" is more of a relaxed hangout comedy that sentimentally pays respect to the Hollywood that sparked Quentin's dreams and aspirations. The film is a nostalgic farrago rather than a period drama of the likes of \"Basterds,\" \"Django,\" or \"The Hateful Eight.\"\n\nThe film does lack tension compared to other Tarantino films, but that is not the case during the sprawling sequence in which Cliff visits the Spahn Ranch. In terms of danger and suspense, this scene is reminiscent of the pawn shop ordeal in \"Pulp Fiction.\" \n\nOne of the most moving scenes in the film belongs solely to Tate and is largely made possible due to Robbie's speechless performance. Tate attends a sparsely populated matinee to see herself in \"The Wrecking Crew.\" The onscreen footage of the real-life Sharon Tate, coupled with Robbie watching wondrously, makes this realization of a dream even more poignant.\n\nConsidering its two-hour, forty-one minute runtime, the film gets off to a slow start in the first act and meanders during the second, but it all pays off in the end. Very much like the Westerns it imitates, the film gets better as it drags along, ultimately reaching its satisfying culmination. Even though \"Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood\" is largely a deviation from other Tarantino revenge flicks, its denouement is just as vengefully gratifying.",

On one hand it's not a difficult storyline to follow but as I'm watch I am constantly asking what the heck is going on.  The story just seemed to have no purpose and no destination and yet it did and that destination was really only about 3% of the movie.  I love some of quentin tarantino other films so I was excited to see this and if you think about it he takes you on this parallel ride following two guys, an actor and his stuntman, and while he is trying to tell this odd story of a washed up actor who is trying to get it together you see blimps of what is known to have really happened to Sharon Tate leading up to her real death.  And of course is great Tarantino fashion he flips the script so to speak but that is really only the last 5 minutes of the movie.  I was told to watch it a second and maybe third time cause it gets better but it just fell short for me and I don't think I can't get through it again.  I'd rather watch Reservoir Dogs (which is a great movie) then to give this movie a second chance.",

            "content": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is almost a good film. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained while watching it. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are a joy to watch on screen, but I never want to see this movie again and I am so glad Tarantino didn't win anything for it. And it's all because of that ending.\n\nThe weird fanfic-y turn it takes at the end is completely unconnected from the main story of the plot and as a result feels incomplete as a climax. You don't get any resolution for the arcs of Rick Dalton or Cliff Boone, the main characters of the story. Instead you get a \"What If\" scenario where all of a sudden our protagonist turn into action heroes and then it's just over. I don't have a problem with them stopping the Manson Family, as that could've lead somewhere interesting in theory. However, it should've happened in the second act so we could see how it actually impacts their careers and reputations. Our characters aren't changed by it and the world of the movie isn't changed by it either. It changed our world, but since we can't actually bring Sharon Tate back from the grave and prevent Roman Polanski from become a creepy pedophile, then it really doesn't accomplish anything. \n\nIn Inglorious Bastards, which also does the revisionist history thing, the entire film is built around these guys hunting and killing Nazis, so when they kill Hitler, It's a satisfying conclusion. The Manson Family are there as a subplot and a not very deep one at that. The movie is about the two being washed up Hollywood performers living unfulfilled lives and in the end, that doesn't change. Rick getting invited into the Tate-Polanski House at the end doesn't actually mean anything. Maybe Rick Dalton will one day star in Chinatown, but we have no way of knowing that. As far as we know, they're still miserable losers and will continue to be after the events of August 9, 1969.\n\nWhen this near 3 hour movie just abruptly ends, you can't help but feel cheated by all the time it wastes. Sharon Tate did not need to be a character in this movie. None of her scenes are important and it's just done as a misdirection to the audience. We all know what happens to her with the Manson Family in our timeline, so it's meant to work as dramatic irony to build tension for when she gets killed, but that doesn't happen, so it ends up being pointless.\n\nThings that are excusable in the moment become unforgivable in hindsight. We get a lot of flashbacks and fake movie scenes that don't really contribute anything to the plot. I get that Tarantino just wanted to jerk himself off and do a bunch of fun skits, but when it doesn't build to anything and just pads the length of an already over-long movie, then they should be left on the cutting room floor. I liked a few of these scenes, even though they all went on way too long, but I would've rather had that time be used to focus on something relevant instead of just being a love letter to old movies and tv. And why did we have so many scenes of Brad Pitt driving his car? I get it, people drive a lot in LA and you get to see some recognizable visuals, but that doesn't mean I want to see it. There must've been 10 minutes at least of Brad Pitt driving his car.\n\nOverall, I think I feel cheated by this movie. Quinten Tarantino has made some great films over the years (Djanjo Unchained is one of my all-time favorites), but this is a definite miss. There were bits I liked. I absolutely loved Rick Dalton, which is why the finale pisses me off so much. It's because I liked the movie that I hate it. Does that make sense? If it doesn't, then you know exactly how I feel about the creative decisions in this movie. It's the perfect example of a director not being told \"No\". It's easily one of Tarantino's worst films, as it truly goes for style over substance. It's meandering, bloated, sensationalist, and not nearly as clever as it thinks it is. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is every bad thing critics say about Tarantino and it deserves to be left in the past",

But overall, when comparing it to non-Quentin films, it's still great.  The star power is ridiculously over-powered.  And they all do a really good job of stepping out of the roles we expect from them, and playing these unique characters.  The cinematography was a big plus, as it made the film come across as very genuine.  Leo, as usual, kills it in this role as an aging Hollywood star.  I didn't think Pitt deserved an Oscar for his role, but he was very entertaining.  It's a fun movie that puts a whole new spin on how the Manson murders turned out in another dimension.  I would definitely recommend this film, but not before all of his other classics.",

For instance, I love Bruce Dern but his cameo struck me as just odd. The movie has very little violence until the end, when the light drama suddenly shifts into an over-the-top gore fest that is cartoonishly gruesome and out of tone from the rest of the movie.

            "content": "There are certain filmmakers that settle into their distinct style more and more with each film. Quentin Tarantino is among that group. Tarantino has also reached the same stature in the film community that Stephen King has in the literary world: for better or worse, he's too successful to be edited down. Indeed, his latest film might also be his most \"Tarantino\" film since Pulp Fiction. Once Upon a in Time\u2026in Hollywood, a sprawling but not quite epic tour through Los Angeles in 1969 that crosses paths with Bruce Lee, the Manson Family, and Sharon Tate, indulges in long, two-character conversations, pop culture references (both obvious and subtle), wall to wall pop music, flashbacks, insert shots and closeups, barefoot women, an unnecessary narrator, cameos from actors from previous films, and, of course, some bloody, bloody violence. There's also an emotional maturity that we haven't seen since Jackie Brown.\n\nI left the theater uncertain whether I liked the picture or not, but by the time I got to my car I knew for sure that I had just seen the most interesting and challenging film by Tarantino in years. I also knew I had seen one of the best films of 2019. Tarantino always manages to surprise us, even when his films are set around historical events.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio stars as Rick Dalton, a former TV cowboy who can now only land roles playing the villain of the week on other shows (many of them, Green Hornet, The F.B.I, Lancer, are real shows). A Hollywood agent (Al Pacino in a small but well-played part) offers Rick a second chance as a leading man in Italian spaghetti westerns. Rick takes this as proof that he's a has-been. DiCaprio does the best acting of his career as the washed-up TV cowboy, especially in the scenes of him on the set of the TV western, Lancer. In a wonderfully written, beautifully performed scene between Rick and a child actress DiCaprio expresses vulnerability in a way he never has with any character. 10-year-old Julia Butters proves to be a worthy scene partner for DiCaprio (which is no surprise if you've seen her steal every scene on the TV show American Housewife).\n\nBrad Pitt plays Cliff Booth, Rick's stuntman, driver, handyman, and only friend. If Rick is washed up, Cliff is un-hirable. He may, or may not, have killed his wife and gotten away with it (Tarantino shows us a brief ambiguous flashback) which, along with his irresponsible behavior on set, doesn't endear him to stunt coordinators. Pitt's performance is not exactly showy, but it is pronounced. Cliff is a character with no self-illusions; he has an easy confidence and Pitt is very comfortable in the role. It's not his most challenging performance but it is one of his most memorable.\n\nMargot Robbie plays the beautiful rising star Sharon Tate. She and her husband Roman Polanski, the hottest director in Hollywood, have just moved in next door to Rick. The few scenes that follow Tate as she goes about her day play more like distant observations that idolize her rather than moments that show us an inner life or build her up as a character. Robbie doesn't have many lines but she still brings her enchanting screen presence to the role, which in this case is all that is required.            \n\nOnce Upon a Time...in Hollywood has a fun, brilliant energy. Since you are essentially just hanging out with Rick and Cliff as they go about their days there is a slight episodic feel as the movie goes on but the pacing is smooth and steady. In each scene you'll find Tarantino's signature sharp dialogue and interesting, colorful characters, both fictional and fictionalized. A long scene that places Cliff at the Spahn Movie Ranch, home of the Manson Family, is the most tense and frightening scene Tarantino has ever done. It's a Hitchcockian scene bursting with suspense. The most entertaining scene in the entire movie is a long flashback to Cliff's fight with Bruce Lee. This scene has caused a lot of controversy (Lee's family has called in disrespectful) because it suggests that Cliff, a stuntman with no training, could have possibly won in a fight with Bruce Lee. I don't think the scene pokes fun at Lee; if anything, Lee getting thrown without padding into a car door so hard it leaves a crater and then just shaking it off a moment later makes this Bruce Lee look pretty badass. It's also a delight to watch Mike Moh's great performance as the larger than life Bruce Lee.\n\n\nThe Hollywood of this movie feels like a very lived-in world. Nothing feels completely brand new. The sets of TV shows are deglamorized work places. Everything from the hip and not so hip clothing to the cars to the homes feel like the people in this movie have actually been using them. Little details like radio commercials for movies, old TV commercials, movie posters, and billboards all add up to a total immersion in this time period. It's this immersive, authentic feel that is at odds with the film's final act, the night of the Sharon Tate and her houseguest's murder. Tarantino, never one to let a story go where you think, does something unexpected which, honestly, I should have seen coming. It's right there in the title, \"Once Upon a Time\u2026\" Despite all of the intricate details, it seems this film is a fantasy after all. \n\nThe final act won't work for everyone, there's also plenty in the rest of the movie that won't work for everyone (like having one of the leads be a potential murderer). There have been many, many discussions and arguments about nearly everything in this movie; it's rare that we get a film that sparks such interest and conversations. Tarantino has said that he plans to retire after his next movie. I'm skeptical of such declarations from any filmmaker. If true, his penultimate film provides great entertainment and plenty for us to ponder. It also has my expectations high for his supposed final film.",

Here he brings a very interesting hollywood setting in the late 60's. Right at the beginning of the film you can already imagine what the story will be, as it portrays the murder of Sharon Tate, which shook everyone at the time. Quentin Tarantino's direction and script remain brilliant and extremely authoritative. We can not fail to mention the high point of this work, the performances, Leonardo DiCaprio is impeccable, Margot Robbie is fantastic, but who manages to surprise more is Brad Pitt, who probably did the best job of his career, I believe that Brad's only performance who can go head to head with this is his role in Inglorious Basterds. We also have a brief appearance by Al Pacino, which is a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack is very well done and one of the best of the year. To conclude, I believe that this is not the best film of Tarantino's career, films like Django Unchained, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs present more complete elements, but Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is an excellent work of direction, script, acting and soundtrack sonorous.",

I, hoping the film would pick up in pace after the first hour, assured them to stay. The film did not. Completely different from his previous films, this movie did not maintain my attention due to its slow pace and lack of an interesting story line. The most interesting part of the film (as many others have pointed out) was the ending, but even that was not enough to save the film. The pros would be the outstanding performances from Pitt and DiCaprio. Overall, if the film had a more interesting plot then I would have been more eager to give it a solid rating.

It's a film made by a zealous cinemaphile, and here we can see, as we can in all his movies, his passion for the craft. Tarantino tells the story in his own idiosyncratic way and at his own measured pace.\n\nThe film hops between different plot strands in a narrative that's fascinating, if slow - but never sluggish, thanks to the lively soundtrack and the actors' pep. Many scenes feel bloated, but the detail in those scenes does arguably bear a significance for the viewer in comprehending the film's philosophy. But if you go into the cinema knowing nothing at all about the Tate-LaBianca murders, which much of the younger demographic may well do, then it's hard to make sense of the film's denouement. Of course, even if the case, there's still plenty to enjoy. Once Upon a Time... does feature some comedy gold moments - Cliff Booth's anecdote of his sparring contest with Bruce Lee, in particular. But familiarity with Golden Age movies and their stars, and recognising pop culture references, are a prerequisite for the audience accessing a lot of the humour. For this reason, some of the gags don't land. \n\nDespite not so much going on plot-wise for large segments of the film, there's tonnes going on under the surface. I exhausted myself sifting through the plethora of Golden Age references: names dropped in conversation, pictures of bygone actors on movie posters, contemporary events voiced over car radio. I felt as though the more I noticed, the more context I had for the movie. \n\nThere are easy things to appreciate in Once Upon a Time.... There's a fantastic soundtrack featuring, among others, Simon & Garfunkel and Deep Purple. Tarantino has a knack for choosing the right songs for the right moments. California Dreamin', beautifully sung by Jose Feliciano, plays over a peaceful montage which includes the three narrative threads. It's a moment of peace and of reflection, before the film descends into violence. There are gorgeous shots, too, many of the most satisfying being those tracking shots following cars. Tarantino and his film crew absolutely capture the zeitgeist of 1960s Hollywood.    \n\nThe slow burner terminates in a very violent final act, shocking in not just its brutality but also in the manner it concludes the narrative. I'll say little else on this so to not give away the ending. But after witnessing the graphic violence towards the movies end, one realises just how little violence there has been in the movie up to this point (well, for a Tarantino picture anyway...). \n\nThe hasty final act sits awkwardly against the otherwise inflated run-time, and as a consequence one sits wondering at the film's conclusion if it was worth it. The film's extremely heavy reliance on the audience having prior knowledge of the Tate murders is also irritating. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is, in my opinion, smug and self-indulgent - and unapologetically so. In the end it probably comes down to whether or not we're happy to indulge Tarantino.",

If the dialogue doesn't make you sleep, the slow pace of this picture certainly would (I kept waiting and waiting for this movie to \"get to the point\" of something, but alas, nothing happened - I only managed to sit through 1 hour and 17 minutes of this dreadful tripe of a movie - if you managed more than that, I take my hat off to you). How this movie has been nominated for best picture is a mystery to me, as I've said before, if you gave this movie more than 1 star, you probably should get your head examined. My final verdict, zero stars, but since I can't give it a zero, I'm forced to give it a half-star (something that this movie sure as hell doesn't deserve!)",

            "content": "Once Upon a Time is a pleasing blend of the trappings of new Tarantino; pulpy voiceovers that come out of nowhere to explain something, more standard linear storytelling, revisionist history. And it also has the punch and wit of early Tarantino; the restrained and yet sumptuously enigmatic camera-work of something like Jackie Brown, and the delve back into the friendship of fraudulent men such as in Reservoir Dogs.\n\nBut unlike all of those movies, it seems as if Once Upon a Time is actually concerned with telling a nice story, a story with relatable and sympathetic characters, about growth, and not just in an acerbically witty banterous kind of way. I found DiCaprio gave my favourite performance of his, something sweet and weak and broken and yet also talented, magical and chewed up by the Hollywood system; watching him grow and act and emote is a really exciting cornerstone of this movie.\n\nDespite its protracted and masturbatory scenes towards the middle, they are never anything less than magnetic, potent and brisk. And as the film moves through many sub-genres, it's evident that Tarantino's love of cinema has allowed him to make a mash-up of Hollywood great scenes; the cult horror moments of the Ranch, the pitch perfect Italian cinema section, the incredible tension of the Manson alumni scenes, the french new wave gaze of Tarantino's camera on Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate, now a figure of myth. \n\nI really enjoyed it, it was the most evolved of Tarantino's recent films; fun and unique but more restrained and much warmer and more personable. As a love letter should be. I liked that the relationships seemed genuine, I loved the scene where the two buds watch the show together, and the film as a whole constantly surprised me.\n\nOnce Upon a Time feels like Tarantino's most personal film and yet also like his transition into another medium; Once Upon feels much more novelistic. The ending is absurd and strangely welcome given knowledge of the real world events, it's wish fulfilment of the highest order, but after falling in love with these characters, and acknowledging how much bloodhsed, dashed potential, and bollocks there is in the world, it's nice to see something more like Sorkin's take on The White House in the West Wing; it's OK to feel powerless and use art to understand and sometimes rewrite some of the world's tragedies.",

Tarantino opts for a lazy time jump that offers nothing to the plot except give an excuse for the final action scene to occur. This final climax of the movie is the most forced action scene I have ever seen. I know Tarantino is infamous for gratuitous violence and all but usually it serves a purpose to the plot. Here it serves no purpose and it honestly feels like Tarantino felt obliged to add it to satisfy his fans. The whole ending is trying to set up a subversion of the Manson murders which just feels so tacked on to the rest of the film that has been, up to that point, a subtle character study of an actor falling out of fame. Furthermore, Margot Robbie is entirely wasted in this film. In fact the marketing is completely misleading because she literally does not influence the plot until the very very last shot of the film. None of her scenes have a message or a statement either, they all feel like an excuse to introduce her character so that they can subvert the conclusion at the end. It was such a fantastic film up until the conclusion for me where it really shot itself in the foot.",

It was about 1969, TV character actor Rick Dalton star of the TV show \"Bounty Law\" his stunt double Clint Booth, a wife murderer and their relationship as actor and stunt double. \nQuentin wrote the greatest dialogue and I got everything he was doing here. It's another true mixes fiction film he puts out, when you see that Rick Dalton lives next door to Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate. Filmed  on the same ranch where Charles Manson's \"family\" lived.\nI'm just going to mention a couple scenes as not wanting to spoil it. 1969 was a very scary year to live in California, the Manson murders were gruesome and those killed suffered. Here again Quentin gives us what we want justice to the killings, so he mixes part of what really happened and what is fiction. \nBrad Pitt is so hilariously good in this, He hardly has dialogues but everything with Brad is acting with saying very little. Check out the scene when Cliff Booth fights Bruce Lee , especially funny. \nOne more scene, Al Pacino at his funniest game a sleazy producer Mr. Schwarz who is interested in Rick Dalton (Leo DiCaprio) watches all his movies and TV shows in a binge watching. Schwarz (who Dalton called Schwartz) Pacino tells him it's not Schwartz but Schwarz. He describes what he likes in every clip the studio  sends him, especially funny is when Schwarz tells Dalton that jokers sent this over cinemascope of him on \"Hullabaloo\" complete with cheesy cheerleader girls dancing around him, with Dalton (Leo) singing the song \"The Green Door\" Leo cannot sing Quentin knew it and forced DiCaprio to do it, he was so awful it was hilariously done.\nIf you were the last of the baby boomers you will notice all the hidden jokes in this film. I'd say that 16 and over is all right with this film and I think they would enjoy it too. This is not the story of Charles Manson, he has only one scene it's more about Cliff Booth and Rick Dalton. Great movie, you can watch it over and find the funny parts you missed first time. It is hardly bloody at all.",

This is the based on a true story as it takes place the monts and years ahead of Shannon Tate's gruesome murder. This is kind of the directors version of it, as I see it. It's not excact, it's far of the reality actually, but the base is there.\n\nRick Dalton (DiCaprio) is a falling TV-star, trying to score some movie roles in Hollywood. He lives there with his friend and body double Cliff (Brad Pitt). They share some moments on set but we also se them from the perspectives of there separate lives. Rick's neighbors are Polanski and his beautiful wife, Sharon (Margot Robbie). She is also in the business and if you know the tragic story of her, you kind of know her deal in this film.\n\nI like the way the film develops. It looks great, it's god those great scenes and script - some wonderful lines. It's slick and very cool - all the way. It's so typical Tarrentino that any given scene will give away that he is the man behind it. Filled with references and a score that have so many gems, many of them sampled in songs of my own personal liking. Dakota Fanning, Luke Perry, Al Pacino, Bruce Dern are also in this film. Quite some cast, huh?\n\nSo, there is not much wrong here. I like the retelling of the story and it's a vivid, fun ride. It has those ultra violent scenes to lift it and make it even more entertaining and it has few loose threds and no stupid stuff. This is very entertaining. It's long, but never flat. I like it a whole lot, and I find it to be the directors best flick since the \"Kill Bill\" era.\n\n8.5 out of 10 acid cigs.",

It's a stark reminder that Tarantino is competing with his own legacy. Can anything truly match the sheer brilliance of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction? First cuts are often the deepest, but Once Upon a Time in Hollywood comfortably reaches the bar set so unreasonably high.\n\nHis customary attention to detail is forensic as 35mm film is used to frame a story set in 1969; exactly what have been in use at the time. Fictional characters are cleverly set against true events as they mingle with real people in a concurrent storyline.\n\nRick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a jobbing TV actor who fears the big movie roles have passed him by. He is consoled by Bounty Law; a long running Western where he plays the grizzled bad guy. Faithful wingman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is Rick's stunt double, best friend and confidante. Back in Beverley Hills Rick has new neighbours. Impossibly beautiful actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) has moved in with husband Roman Polanski. Rick is excited by the prospect and could be one pool party away from starring in a Polanski movie. If only he could actually meet them. Meanwhile, producer Harvey Schwarz (Al Pacino) is convinced he can reignite Rick's career with a spaghetti western. Interestingly, the Manson clan is hardly shown in the movie. I actually like this choice, because it left a lingering thought that perhaps Manson was a danger at all times, and didn't play to the audience the way we thought it would. It wasn't a story about the Manson murders. Manson just happened to be going on at the time Dalton and Booth were having their struggles, and it intersected.\n\nThere are many pleasures to be found in \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,\" but Tarantino's interest in replicating Los Angeles in 1969 is worth the price of admission alone. It's enough to find period cars and costumes, but Tarantino goes above and beyond, filling backgrounds with detailed signage and theater marquees, redressed buildings, and packing the radio with advertisements and glorious rock hits to set the mood. Tech credits are downright miraculous, securing the time machine nature of the feature, with Tarantino as much in love with his layered frames as he is with the characters, working diligently to take away the modern world. There's enough going on around the action in \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" to warrant multiple viewings, just to see the hospital corners Tarantino achieves when resurrecting the end of an era. Very impressive .\n\nDiCaprio proves to be such a perfect choice for Dalton that one can't really imagine anyone else in the part. It's one of his best performances, although he's arguably topped by a fantastic Pitt, that reminds viewers how wonderful he can be in the right material.\n\nIt's a glorious fusion of genres; part western, buddy movie and homage to popular culture in the 1960s. Stylish and visually stunning, it bears the classic hallmarks of a Tarantino film. Maddening tangents, delightful cameos and set pieces all provide a compulsive mixture. The cinematography, the writing, the casting, the soundtrack, all flawless. This is a superior film and sits comfortably in my top three Tarantino films. 10/10",

            "content": "For some reason movie makers want to relive the 70's (or very late 60's in this case), which if you lived it back then was one of the worst decades to be around, except for maybe the Bicentennial celebrations.  The 70's gave us a lost war, high gas prices, runaway inflation, disco and Jimmy Carter.  So you can see why most of America does not want to see bell-bottom wearing characters in loud print shirts even to this day.  The 70's was so bad, that most people in the 80's adamantly eschewed anything to do with the prior decade.  As with the Irishman, this movie Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, is outdated, and I had little care to revisit the events of those August nights.  perhaps something more current would have been a good topic?  Or at least something not 50 years ago.  Plus, this rendition was not only boring through the first two hours, but most of the winding plot had little to do with character development, other than to say, this guy is a stuntman, and this guy is a method actor.  And why did we have to watch Sharon Tate going to a theater to watch her own movie.  Who cares?  Perhaps some comic or anecdotal writing during this two hour window would have made sense?  Maybe next film.  At the end the explanation of the movie title is revealed, although a bit muddled for my taste.  Also, and just a note here for the producer, if a character is in a swimming pool getting flamethrower roasted, perhaps it would be sensible to go under the water, instead of just screaming loudly and being burned to a crisp.  In fact, that is a good lesson for any of us.  If you are on fire (even if you are not in a pool) please find some water nearby to douse yourself.  Or baking powder, if it is a grease fire.  Just sayin.  It seems to me that, like The Irishman, this movie was not well thought out, and that the writer/producer/director was simply relying on us to watch this film because Leo and Brad were in it.  So shame on us, I guess.  Overall, I believe if you are going to make a movie about Hollywood, and all the foibles that go with Hollywood, it should at least have some edge in it, and some tongue in cheek comedy,  like The Player, or The Big Picture.",

I'm a sucker for his random interstitials that bring more context and backstory to the characters. They always present themselves to be context clues for the viewer, but conclude to be vital to the story in the end. The last act of the movie presented so many unexpected events, and was very over the top. I really appreciate this about Quentin Tarantino because he does this in every one of his films, just because he can.

There are also plenty of great bit roles throughout, featuring the likes of Al Pacino, Kurt Russell, Margaret Qualley, Timothy Olyphant, etc. The cinematography and scene transitions are beautiful, as well as Tarantino's overall direction. Finally, the soundtrack is pretty catchy without being distracting. In sum, it's Quentin Tarantino's most nature project yet, and is well worth watching.",

Leo as Rick Dalton is great to watch as his career stalls after being a massive star in the 50's in tv shows. Definitely Tarantino most funniest film as their chemistry is second to none. Everyone else who has a cameo appearance does brilliant in the screen time that they get. Once again, Tarantino changes history in the 3rd act and for me it paid off. Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate does a wonderful and heartfelt job. The way that Tarantino shows us what movie making is like, is a amazing in movie joke.

A time-machine de force that magnificently captures the charm, neon glow and subversive seediness of Hollywood at a time when the 60s vision of peace and love was fading into disappointment, while offering a surreal, fable-like ending that erases at least one of humankind's great horrors. Some might call it revisionist-history revenge.

The movie is mostly just following these three characters around and seeing their daily lives but there really isn't much of a flowing narrative.

A few later, once the film came out for rent, I decided to give it a second chance, duly based on all the Oscar buzz it was getting. Something clicked the second time around, because the film hit me so much harder. Yes, it's long, with a LOT of drawn out acting scenes, but there's something completely different to appreciate about this film that differs from Tarantino's prior work. It's the performances and specific traits presented by the film's two leads. The story's fantastic, and the last 20 minutes of the film are some of my favorite moments in a movie, but the forced vulnerability of Leonardo DiCaprio's \"Rick Dalton\", combined with the nonchalant humor of Brad Pitt's \"Cliff Booth\" make for the greatest movie duo I can think of.

Margo Robby was fine. The actors felt too loose at times. I'm not sure if it was them having so much fun during the process, not focused or if this was a deliberate design by Tarantino; probably the latter right?  The film had great production design and the writing I thought was tremendous. The problem for me was the length. You felt it. It was just way too unnecessarily long. Tarantino is a unique writing, iconic genius, but someone needs to tell him in his ear and whisper \"cut\" a little more often. The pace was too slow and not tight enough. Editing wasn't the strongest here. The music was phenomenal.  Side note* I wrote a review 3 weeks ago. Clearly, it did not save.",

No it was a more laid back approach from Tarantino, this film focusing on fictional actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) who isn't the same actor he used to be, due to this he is facing a dilemma in the film industry. Not to forget his stunt double Cliff Booth, (Brad Pitt) is very supportive of his old buddy and that was a great duo and relationship to watch on screen. Leo's lead role was different to his usual, that's for sure. It was actually a pleasant surprise to watch Leo DiCaprio play a less serious character for once. He was was actually really amusing at times. This film in my opinion is a great film and has been widely referred to as Tarantino's \u2018Crown Jewell' or his \u2018love letter to Hollywood' I believe the film is a metaphor for the current stage their careers that Leo and Quentin are currently in. They are both middle aged artists who have more than likely seen their heyday already, now they are more than likely going to decline and pave way for future film makers to actors. So when you look deeper into the artistic ways Tarantino expresses himself through film, you can't help but be impressed. Overall In my opinion it ranks somewhere in the bottom half in my favourite Tarantino movies, however it was beautifully produced and was great fun from start to finish.",

The climax may be grandiose, typical of its director, but the successes of the protagonists aren't won by anything they've come to learn throughout the story, which is an indispensable part of telling a story. Worst of all, this movie assumes that just because we know about the Manson murderers, it can gloss over those characters in its narrative, which is nothing short of lazy writing that makes for an unsatisfying story, to my great disappointment.",

The symbolism of rick dalton a man stuck in time who wants to stay in the fantasy land meeting sharon tate after not dying her horrific murder that ended the 60s is just fantastic. Even the controversial bruce lee representation had a purpose to further establish who cliff is as a member of Hollywood at the time. The POV of cliff was on bruce Lee a successful asian man who practically shunned hollywood and its portrayal of toughness and power. Cliff was an all American stunt man who saw things through his filter. Clearly an antihero even being framed as his wife's murderer you still connect with him on a human level. Also let's not forget that the flashback may not even be a flashback at all but a day dream as it's up in the air similar to if he murdered his wife or not.  All we know is that just going off the movie title \"once upon a time\" we can tell that this movie will contain a lot of fictional depictions of the era and the people. Moving on to Margot Robbies portrayal of sharon tate, it was simply genius as she was able to convey Tate's overall personality with few lines just pure expression. Her act left me not wanting anymore than I have recieved as her purpose was also not to be a deep delved in biographical portrayal but a great stand in to represent the late sharon tate. The cinematography was great obviously focusing on the the aesthetic of the time with great attention to detail from the lesser known dirty movie theater to the o so timeless classic cars which were a joy to see on screen. Let us not forget about the great tarentino touch of violence in his movies arguably being some of the most fun and entertaining deaths I have ever see on the big screen, I mean you have spoiler alert a manson girl who dies from being pelted by a dog food can and another one being flamethrowered. And the cherry ontop the most cringeworthy attack of all being bit in the nuts by a giant dog. Definitely a 10/10 movie, a must watch for fans and those who seek movies such as this, get it on blue ray easily an entertaining rewatchable movie.",

The reason I say the wrong house is because in 1969 they didn't go to the the wrong house and they weren't killed, they in fact brutally murdered pregnant Sharon Tate and her house guests, not to original Quentin. I think that Mr. Tarantino actually smoked the acid laced cigarette before he wrote this garbage.\nThis movie couldn't hold a candle to the Beverly Hillbillies, what happened to movies like Key Largo, The Maltese Falcon, The Godfather, Hunt for Red October, Tombstone, The Outlaw Josey Wales, Goodfellas, just to name a few. I truly don't understand how people can find movies of this caliber remotely entertaining. Both my wife and I are 61 and know good from bad when it comes to cinema and this was a pure waste of valuable time, actually the music score was very good but I would have preferred to watch 3 episodes of The Rockford Files instead.

This is the most restrained, and arguably the most deliberate and poised that Tarantino's ever been; from the opening shot you know you are in the hands of a master of his craft. This IS a traditional Tarantino movie, with elements of many of his all time classics - multiple plot lines, an abundance of references, metaphorical violence, seamless flashbacks that are the closest cinematic equivalent to Leopold Bloom's wandering thoughts in Ulysses that we have - but it moves slower, you have to pay closer attention, and the moments of cartoonish bloodshed are scarcer yet arguably sharper.

We reflect as a former television star struggles to keep up in an ever-changing world. And we do enjoy seeing Pitt smash a hippie into an art-deco mantelpiece. Red Apple cigarettes of an abundance, Tarantino lets his characters drive the story, creating a more comfortable atmosphere than he has previously.  \nSharon Tate (Margot Robbie) watches her own movie (which features the real Sharon Tate), and there is something about seeing her pride as the audience around her enjoy her performance that is much more powerful than a certain (completely poorly executed) film of this same year that attempts to tackle the same subject matter. \nTarantino's writing is some of his best work. The production design is incredible. The music is a hand-picked selection from the time (sadly a year off being able to rehash 'Little Green Bag'), with the occasional obscure reference to television adverts and forgotten 60's pop culture. \nThen we are thrown out of time, to the tune of 'Out of Time.'

Each frame stamped with audio and visual markers of the time, the face of 1960s Los Angeles could very well be listed at top of show. We amble around the city's diverse landscapes, move seamlessly from scenes revealing who and what made our our characters who they are, to presentational docu-style VO and montage, to B&W clips from \"TV shows\" and back and forth and back again. As the city and its inhabitants flit and flaunt, each sign and symbol plays a role, as we slowly progress with a Bresson-like cool elegance. While Once Upon A Time creeps and lulls, time seems to slow, and the anxiety of the approach fills the void. At some point extreme violence will be unleashed, but it's a careful cat and mouse on the biggest and most dynamic of stages -- something only someone like Tarantino, professionally and personally, could create. The story, largely centered on the fall of Dicaprio's stumbling and fumbling aging star, weighs proportionately with the up-swing of Sharon Tate and her buoyant untouchables, while Pitt's cool and ageless form drives steady on like Los Angeles itself. \n\nIt's a finely composed masterful piece: specific, unique, intentional. Tarantino, like Bresson, made films his own way: \"his interior view of cinema had no application if modified,\" and for that we can be grateful.",

There were no cell phones or computers. We actually LIVED our lives in groups, big protests every day blocking streets, sit-ins at colleges.  Going to jail was EXPECTED.\n\nCIVIL rights, freedom riders, the killing of JFK in '63 then MLK jr and Bobby Kennedy in \u201868.  The entire nation mourned...it wasn't just in the news for one day...then gone. We GRIEVED for weeks.  No cable TV...but then I had no TV.  No one had the money.  At 18, you left home. No money from parents, just working basic jobs: nurse aide in ICU, maid at TraveLodges, waitress at Holiday Inn. Had a scholarship, so was able to go to school.  Jean-Claude Killy was triple gold champ in skiing and we skiers worshipped him!  Rossignol Skis, Head 360s, we went from wooden skis and leather boots w long thongs to fiberglass Hart skis and plastic boots.\n\nThis is what this movie showed to me.  Things played out through long days on movie sets, real life--living on own with only a dog.  Unless you lived through the time you would NEVER have understood living next door to Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate.  Instead of just being a victim, she was a wonderfully happy blonde actor from Dean Martin and the Wrecking Crew...I loved who she was.  The REAL old TV series like Wanted Alive with Steve McQueen, it was a BIG step up to movies like the Great Escape including carrying that baseball glove and ball.\n\nSpaghetti Westerns turned Clint Eastwood from a TV \"oater\", a western Round-Up with Rowdy Gaines into a major movie star and director---for Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) Spaghetti Westerns, were a last chance.  Perfect!  The actors all shot their scenes in their own languages and no attempt was made to have all speak English, Spanish, or Italian.  It was chaos.  But we went to those movies like a Fistful of Dollars for Clint Eastwood--steely eyed tall, lanky actor for his cigarillo, Mexican poncho, and quick draw. The three movies lasted 3-4 hours with practically no dialogue, few action sequences that went on for 15-20 minutes each of ppl mainly staring each other down. NO ONE WAS BORED.  Best yet? We watched them at a Drive-Inn---how many ppl under 60 knew what a drive-in was.\n\nAhh the music was great.  Unless you lived at the time you didn't understand the power of music that everyone knew--even Rick Dalton singing in his floating chair in THE status symbol--a kidney shaped pool.  I was singing along to every song as I had seen every singer in person--not a Youtube video--but in person. Sitting in Golden Gate sitting on the grass listening to Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Quick Silver Messenger Service. Tickets for Jim Morrison/Doors, Jefferson Airplane were $3! Also weed was everywhere.  I remember having to make money w 10 friends, I drove from Phoenix with a pickup filled with red cellophane kilo bricks of weed.  Threw straw on top, covered with a tarp, wore my western shirt and cowboy hat and drove home.  I was Miss Rodeo Queen and cute (LONNNG time ago) so was never pulled over by the police. We all spent a weekend listening to the Woodstock double vinyl album on HUGE speakers with a record player, separating out the buds from the stems--then putting stems into an Osterizer blender. Nickel and Dime bags that truly were plastic sandwich bags rolled up with rubber bands at $5 and $10 each.  We'd be so STONED because we were always passing around doobies (blunts) and inhaling.\n\nThe whole Spahn Ranch was TERRIFYING because everyone knew who Charlie Manson and Squeaky Fromme were!  The Manson Family. From their \"Helter Skelter blood stains and wall writings at the slaughter of Sharon Tate et al, to the attempted assassination of Reagan.  Except Manson was really small. Showing Tate pregnant and her new nursery was awful!  Because the Manson Family WOULD slaughter her when she was pregnant. Interesting that all the girls/women called him Charlie and NO ONE said Manson.  I was VERY glad that they didn't show the slaughter.  But the story of Rick Dalton ending a good career making cigarette ads (Loved how he threw the cigarette Red Apple on the floor in disgust and tore down his cutout picture!)  He was the epitome of the end of radio, three primetime news stations, and the old by the book TV shows like Mannix, and the number of TV and Movie Westerns.\n\nBrad Pitt as the stunt man?  Wow--never really thought of those guys and how they were also go-fers for the star.  He was magnificent--not too bright (as was Rick Dalton.)  Loved how he went after Bruce Lee. Lee brought karate and Kung Foo fighting to mainstream TV.  What a DICK!\n\nThank you Quentin Tarantino for a PERFECT movie of that time!",

Tarantino is one of those directors that you love him or hate him, and most of movie lovers choose the ladder.\nSet in 1969 Los Angeles, the film follows an actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Brad Pitt), as they navigate the changing film industry, and features multiple storylines in a modern fairy tale tribute to the final moments of Hollywood's golden age.\nWe all know the actors in any Tarantino movie brings their A-game. We just haven't seen anybody act the way they do in this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio was great as an actor on the brinks of being a has been and struggling to keep up with the greats. My personal favorite is Brad Pritt as DiCaprio's stunt man. He was so funny and when he was needed to be serious, he brought it!\nThis movie was perfection to me! Everything plays a part in the experience. This is some of the best acting I have seen in a long time. I was swept away with the look, music, and story. The best part of this movie is when you are spending time with these characters. One of my favorite scenes is when Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are sitting on the couch watching a screening of DiCaprio's shows and doing commentary on it. It was great.\nOverall, this movie was a high anticipation of mine and it did not disappoint. It has great performances and tells a high stakes story that keeps you on the edge of your seat.\n5/5",

Actually, the Tarantino film most comparable to \"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood,\" his fictionalization of the Sharon Tate story, is clearly \"Inglourious Basterds\" (2009), and in truth I would have liked this movie far more had its gimmick not already been deployed 10 years ago. But that aside, \"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood\" offers Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt A-plus parts and ample opportunity to act their hearts out with old-fashioned swagger, especially in a classic scene between DiCaprio and Julia Butters, playing a precocious child actor. Speaking of which, fanboy Tarantino's embrace and re-creation and in some cases brazen fabrication of '50s and '60s westerns, actors, TV shows and even products (rat-flavored dog food!) are giddily on display every minute of the film, making it a Hollywood film about Hollywood that any like-minded film buff would enjoy. Margot Robbie's casting as Sharon Tate (who you may have heard died in 1968) initially seemed off, but she wound up embodying her so beautifully that actual footage of Tate from \"The Wrecking Crew\" (1968) is used without causing a double-take that the woman watching \"herself\" in it is an entirely different person.",

We follow Leonardo Dicaprio's Rick Dalton as he starts making spaghetti westerns but none of these scenes feel relevant, he's also shown to have a drinking problem, but there's no resolution to that character flaw. Brad Pitt's Cliff Booth keeps having run ins with the Manson family and other people in Hollywood that don't really like him. They try to cram in some backstory about him possibly killing his wife, but again, this doesn't really matter. The Bruce Lee scene was totally random and Charles Manson was only in one small scene. We also watch Sharon Tate while she watches her own movie... for most of this movie. The end fight scene was pretty interesting but came way too late.

Ironically, I was a huge QT fan with Kill Bill vol 1 and Pulp Fiction being two favorites. But unfortunately this is what he's become now. Even the women are used as props for men's ego. Sharon Tate dances around looking pretty, propping her feet up instead of talking. Under age Pussycat boorishly throws herself at Brad Pitt most of it, making him seem desirable and cool.

This shallow depiction of girls and women may play into the director's juvenile fantasies but it is not a realistic view of human beings and is unoriginal and tiresome. Generally the film drags along as a kind of homage to the director's fantasy of what film production in Hollywood in the 1960s would have been like, but it's a fantasy that is unlikely to engage the interest of many viewers. There are some comedic and poignant moments and the last 20 minutes of revenge violence is satisfying, but overall you're better off not wasting your time on this film- and given that the film is nearly 3 hours long, it is a lot of time that you will be wasting.",

The greatest part of the film is the final act. A sense of horrible tension grows, as I as viewer expect to see an enactment of the brutal Manson Family murders. Instead, Tarantino gives us an alternate history in which several Manson cultists are, what I can only describe as, Tarantino-ed to death with farcical levels of brutality - witch are strangely cathartic compared to the pitiful true life horror I expected to have to endure watching. The ending also explains the \"Once Upon a Time...\" title, as we're reminded of the tragedy that actually took place that night.",

There was a lot of thing that happened in the beginning and during the film that could have come as cause and consequence but led to nothing. Margot Robbies role as Sharon Tate amounted to nothing. Sharon Tate could have been played by anyone and she didn't have that moment in the film that made her stand out. Uma in Pulp Fiction had a small part, but it was a memorable one. Pam Grier captured each scene in Jackie Brown. I felt Robbie was given nothing to make her stand out. Also I HATED how he portrayed Bruce Lee in this film.

As\u00ed sonaba, esto pasaba, esta es la m\u00fasica que se escuchaba, las drogas que se tomaban, esto era ir al cine antes de las salas de cine, as\u00ed funcionaba la industria para los actores y los dobles de riesgo, as\u00ed trabajaban los representantes y as\u00ed viv\u00edan los grandes directores, o los actores populares y hasta los olvidados. Estas eran sus fiestas y estas sus rutinas, estos eran sus miedos y sus gajes, estas eran las personas que vivieron los d\u00edas de 1969, antes de que Manson y sus seguidores lo cambiaran todo. \n\nPorque eso hicieron: cambiaron la historia. El asesinato de Sharon Tate marc\u00f3 el fin del jipismo \u2013cuyo paneg\u00edrico fue Woodstock\u2013 pero tambi\u00e9n trajo un cambio importante en la cultura popular y psicolog\u00eda de todo un pa\u00eds. Del mundo, en realidad, porque Hollywood significa mainstream y ya desde entonces los yanquis exportaban cultura. Y por eso estas dos horas del onanismo nost\u00e1lgico de Tarantino son importantes. Porque en ellas \u2013a trav\u00e9s de la nostalgia de Quentin, estoy hablando de la m\u00fasica en la radio, las calles y sus carteles encendi\u00e9ndose por la noche, las voces de los locutores de radio, los programas en la televisi\u00f3n\u2013 se construye un ambiente que en los \u00faltimos minutos \u2013en la usual clave de violencia tarantinesca\u2013 deconstruye la nostalgia para que los 20 segundos finales transformen al filme en un cuento de hadas. \n\nY todo a partir de una pregunta muy sencilla: \u00bfc\u00f3mo habr\u00eda sido el mundo si las cosas hubieran sido diferentes?\n\nPor eso, cuando dicen que es muy lenta, que es muy larga, que pod\u00eda ser m\u00e1s corta y permanecer poderosa, me pregunto: \u00bfc\u00f3mo es posible que esperemos a\u00f1os por pel\u00edculas de Marvel, o temporadas de Game of Thrones, pero no seamos capaces de disfrutar dos horas de construcci\u00f3n de trama y ambiente? \u00bfDe qu\u00e9 manera, entonces, podremos entender c\u00f3mo un actor acabado, narcisista e inseguro y un doble de riesgo con un pasado reprobable pueden ser h\u00e9roes y cambiar la historia? \u00bfC\u00f3mo habr\u00eda sido el presente si los record\u00e1ramos a ellos y no a Manson?\n\nDe alguna forma Quentin hizo lo mismo que hace siempre, pero le dio un muy necesario giro de frescura. Este filme lo marca como m\u00e1s dispuesto a jugar con el lenguaje visual, esta vez a su manera. Ya no son solo homenajes divertidos que dan tono, ahora tienen la meta de dar tono y profundizar el giro de la trama.\n\n Eso se nota en algo tan sencillo como que el lenguaje de las c\u00e1maras, en las primeras horas del filme, es t\u00edpico del western cl\u00e1sico, para darse el gusto de mostrarse como un muy sobrio spaghetti western en los \u00faltimos minutos. No es que haya algo nuevo bajo el sol en las tierras de Quentin Tarantino, es que los a\u00f1os lo han animado a ser un poco m\u00e1s sutil, \u00edntimo y honesto.\n\n\u00a1Y el elenco! \u00a1Qu\u00e9 buenas actuaciones! Primero que nada, DiCaprio que encarna con maestr\u00eda a un actor derrotado \u2013lo cual, cuando eres un actor de la calidad de DiCaprio, debe ser m\u00e1s que dif\u00edcil\u2013. Tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 Margot Robbie que enternece en su rol de Sharon Tate y la representa tal como la describieron las leyendas tras su muerte: un ser alegre, tan humano como angelical, cuya misi\u00f3n es ganarse la ternura del p\u00fablico, tal como lo hizo la Tate original. \n\nPero el que se roba la pel\u00edcula es Brad Pitt con el personaje m\u00e1s misterioso y mejor construido de todos, un vaquero de la vida real, un sujeto posiblemente horrible, pero al que conocemos desde su lado m\u00e1s tierno, un protag\u00f3nico que comparte escenas con los mejores personajes secundarios: Margareth Qualley en su encarnaci\u00f3n del horror oculto en el cuerpo de la juventud y Brandy, la pitbull \u2013verdadera hero\u00edna de la pel\u00edcula\u2013 que hace de su fiel mascota en un gui\u00f1o muy tarantinesco: un doble de acci\u00f3n due\u00f1o de una can tan entrenada como tuvo que estarlo Lassie.\n\nEn resumen: es el Tarantino de siempre, pero se siente m\u00e1s \u00edntimo, maduro. Es un Tarantino que se da el trabajo de, lentamente, ponernos en contexto para compartir con nosotros un recuerdo muy suyo. Y, lo mejor, no est\u00e1 solo, cuenta con un impresionante elenco que le puso alma, vida y coraz\u00f3n a una pel\u00edcula sencilla en apariencia, pero que de seguro requiri\u00f3 de much\u00edsimo trabajo. As\u00ed que hay que verla. S\u00ed o s\u00ed en cine, s\u00ed o s\u00ed en su idioma original.",

The movie starts to go off the rails in regards to the Manson family. The ending is not expected but not in a good way. Inglorious Bastards is great because of the twist at the end. This movie isn't for everyone but I understand that some may love it. I think it's a good movie but nothing more.",

While Tarantino's tenth film is unique in its vision and storytelling, Once Upon a Time In Hollywood is weird and boring. Getting to see so much talent on screen was nice but not in an unenjoyable bonkers fairy tale uselessly set in a real time in history with real people without telling the real events. Perhaps if the rumors are true it is better for this to be Tarantino's final feature especially if he's going to continue being racist and misogynistic.",

I could re-watch Leo yelling at hippies in his robe, blender of frozen margarita in hand, on repeat. The casting looks-wise was spot-on and there was not a single weak link in the acting. Many lovely cameos too (Pacino, Damian Lewis, Kurt Russel, Lena Dunham, etc.). A story of \"old\" Hollywood meeting the new on the days leading up to the literal and figurative end of the 1960s and what it stood for. Surprisingly, only a handful of violent scenes \u2014 but they dialed up the gore to make up for quality what they lacked in quantity. The alternate history ending was cathartic for what is was, and depressing because it had not been. Oh, and don't overlook the flamethrower\u2026",
