    "summary": "Mass murderer Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) is resurrected from the bottom of Crystal Lake. After he kills a passing boat's occupants, he stows away on a cruise ship filled with a high-school graduating class bound for New York City. Biology teacher Charles McCulloch (Peter Mark Richman) is on board with his niece, Rennie (Jensen Daggett), who has visions of Jason drowning as a child. They escape his bloody shipboard rampage, but, when Rennie and Charles reach Manhattan, Jason is close by.",

            "content": "Friday the 13th Part 8: Jason Takes Manhattan is the eighth film in the slasher film franchise that takes Jason Voorhees, the undead killer who haunts Camp Crystal Lake, to a new location: New York City. The film follows a group of high school graduates who are taking a cruise to celebrate their graduation. However, they are unaware that Jason has boarded the ship and is killing them one by one. The survivors manage to escape to the city, but Jason follows them and continues his rampage. Meanwhile, one of the students, Rennie Wickham, has visions of a young Jason and a mysterious connection to him.\n\nThe film is directed by Rob Hedden, who also wrote the film. The film stars Jensen Daggett, Scott Reeves, Barbara Bingham, Peter Mark Richman, Kane Hodder and others. The film also features the return of Kane Hodder as Jason, who plays the role for the second time.\n\nThe film is a disappointing and misleading entry in the franchise, as it promises a new and exciting setting for Jason, but fails to deliver on it. The film is mostly set on the ship and only shows a few scenes of Jason in New York, which are mostly filmed in Vancouver. The film is also less scary and suspenseful than the previous ones, as it relies on clich√©s and stereotypes. The film is also more silly and absurd than the previous ones, as it features some ridiculous scenes and plot holes. The film is not very enjoyable or satisfying for fans of the series.\n\nFriday the 13th Part 8: Jason Takes Manhattan is a weak and boring slasher film that wastes its potential and betrays its title.",

            "content": "Yes, you read that right. I gave this movie 3 stars out of 5, and I actually have this right above the original 1980 film in my ranking (8th place out of 12 movies, and 9th place for the original). Hear me out, but I find this movie to be hated on too much as I do enjoy it and find it to be campy fun for the most part. Don't get me wrong, this is a garbage movie and indefensible, but I have a ton of fun with it. I love the soundtrack to the movie, with the song \"Darkest Side of the Night\" by the band Metropolis to be the highlight of the film which plays in both the beginning and ending credits. The kills are overall pretty decent as well, so it has that going for it. However, I can't bring myself to rank it much higher as the premise is completely wasted. Jason was only in Manhattan for the last 20 minutes of the movie, with the majority of the movie taking place on a boat whose destination is Manhattan. From there, when he's finally in Manhattan, you can tell the movie was shot in Vancouver and not actually Manhattan. I believe there is only one scene in the movie that was actually filmed in New York, and that was the scene of Jason in Times Square looking around. This version of Jason is a definite step down from Part 7, only saved by the fact that Kane Hodder is still in the role. He has this weird shiny glow to him the entire movie and is all slimy and gross. The characters are pretty uninteresting and the final girl Rennie isn't very memorable either aside from her fear of water. Her uncle is a total scumbag the entire movie and it is very pleasing to see him killed by Jason. The ending of the movie is incredibly bizarre where Jason is drowned in this toxic sludge in a sewer and turns back into a child? Really weird stuff. With all that being said, I still somehow find some enjoyment in the film and I never mind re-watching it.",

Literally two-thirds of it are spent on a cruise ship, which I later discovered happened because they ran into financial problems right before filming was set to begin and had to combine the Manhattan plotting with something cheaper, aka staging most of the movie in a single setting such as a boat. Which, by itself, isn't a bad thing--the kill scenes on the boat are good for the time period, and some of them are a bit creative, especially the one with the guitar and the sauna scene. At the same time, there is no sense of a plot whatsoever with the first two-thirds, and it barely gets better plot-wise once they (very unbelievably) get to Manhattan.\n\nThe way the movie ends was also a bit of a stretch. It's almost like the screenwriter wrote himself into a corner at the very end with the action that preceded it, especially considering the obstacles that Jason survives earlier in the movie, and it just doesn't work for me. Without getting into spoiler territory, I just couldn't believe what finally defeated Jason, and that's even after I suspended my beliefs in reality that a movie such as this requires.\n\nAlso, if you're looking for some gnarly '80s-style gore, don't expect a lot here.\n\nOverall, it's a sub-standard horror movie, but still not the worst slasher I've ever seen.",

            "content": "'Friday the 13th' may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror's most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all off.\n\n'Jason Takes Manhattan', the seventh sequel and the eight film in the series, is one of the lowest rated 'Friday the 13th' films on IMDb. Apart from a couple of interest points, personally have to agree with those who consider 'Jason Takes Manhattan' one of the series' weakest (whether it's the very worst is debatable). It's not terrible and not quite as bad as some have said, but it is lacking in a lot of areas.\n\nThere are merits here. When it comes to the photography, 'Jason Takes Manhattan' is a strong contender for the best shot 'Friday the 13th' film, very stylish and crisp with a lot of atmosphere.\n\nRegarding the music, the music has always been one of the best things consistently, that is the case here, once again being hauntingly eerie and quite catchy even.\n\nKane Hodder returns as Jason and does a valiant job, and very nearly is as spine chilling as he was in the previous film (the make-up lets him down though but the performance itself is spot on). A couple of the deaths are memorable.\n\nIt was also nice to have a change in location, the most interesting thing of 'Jason Takes Manhattan' and what makes it stand out among the rest in this regard.\n\nHowever, 'Jason Takes Manhattan' has a lot of severe drawbacks. And no, the misleading misnomer of the film's title, considering there is too little of Manhattan and it takes too long to get there, is actually the least of its problems. Of the acting the only good performance comes from Hodder, everybody else is either irritating or with the range of a broomstick, meaning the film is one of the series' worst acted.\n\nThe dialogue also makes the film one of the series' worst-written, not just crude, tonally muddled and simplistic but sense is pretty much neglected. The stereotypical characters are the most bland and annoying ones of the series, with the most illogical and stupidest decision making. Am aware that these assets have rarely been strengths in the 'Friday the 13th' films, but not to this extent in comparison to the previous films.\n\nStorytelling is also not great to put it mildly. It takes silliness and senselessness to extreme breaking point, the concept poses a lot of confusion and errors in continuity and too much of the film is too ridiculous to even be entertained by it let alone take seriously. The climax is one of the series' most confusing (incoherent even), head-scratching and laziest. One also feels every minute of the rather too long length, due to the story being a stale rehash pretty much that feels tired.\n\nMake-up and effects are subpar, Jason looks both cheap and goofy, none of the unsettling gruesomeness of 'The New Blood'. Like that film, The humour is more goofy and annoying than tongue-in-cheek and witty (a big problem considering the over-reliance on it, some of the humour felt unintentional too), there is a real shortage of suspense, far too tame scares and the creativity and creepiness of the death scenes are wildly variable and even the best of them are nowhere near close to being on par with the series' most memorable.\n\nOverall, not terrible but rather lacklustre. 4/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Warning: This review contains spoilers\nTo give you an idea of how much thought went into the making of this film, consider that as part of its promotion - they had Kane Hodder (who played Jason, the mute serial killer of the movie) interviewed by Arsenio Hall, who was at that time a huge name in late night television. \n\nHowever, he was interviewed in costume. In character. As a mute, threatening presence. \n\nHall, ever the consummate professional, tried to make a literal one-sided interview work - but there's only so much you can do when the other party here is instructed to do nothing but breathe and glower through a vintage hockey goalie mask. On paper, it looked great. Big name star, interviewing your main property on late night television. The execution, however, was painful to watch.\n\nIt also makes about 10,000 times more sense than the movie it was meant to promote.\n\nFor those not familiar with the Friday the 13th series - they center on the main character, Jason Voorhees - who terrorizes the lake and woods in the district in which he drowned as a child (except the first). It's pretty much paint by numbers - teens go into woods, teens attract attention of hulking homicidal unstoppable brute, teens smoke marijuana and have sex, teens get brutally slaughtered. One person or two survives, end of movie. Not really a formula you can mess up. There are breasts, there's gore, jump scares and the beautiful scenery of rural New Jersey. The fact that this movie got every single part of what made these movies work so terribly terribly wrong is actually an achievement. It's like messing up making ice.\n\nThe movie begins with the drowned-at-the-bottom-of-the-lake Jason (who was \"killed\" yet again at the end of the previous film) reanimated by a houseboat whose anchor conveniently snags on a sunk underwater cable carrying high voltage (common in middle of nowhere country lakes, didn't you know) and causes the voltage to reanimate the corpse of Voorhees. After murdering the teen couple on the boat, the boat (whose anchor apparently disappeared the moment it did its job) drifts down a river Crystal Lake has never been connected to before or since and Jason never thinks to leave the boat to stay where he's always lived and always known and ends up on the coast. Suffice it to say that no map shows such a possible waterway course. \n\nWhat does he do when he reaches the coast? Decides to climb up the side of a ship that so happens to be chartered for the graduating class of \"Lakeview High\", which happens to be about six people.\n\nThe practical upshot of this is after killing a few people onboard, Jason appears to go down with said ship as a few lucky survivors escape. They row their way from what is clearly way beyond \"cruising offshore\" distance and find themselves in Manhattan. It being the 1980s, they're quickly mugged and the Final Girl is kidnapped by a couple of teenage hoodlums. Unfortunately for reasons that still make no sense Jason has followed them and decides to ignore the rest of Manhattan, hunting only them but conveniently killing off the hoodlums first.\n\nThe chase ends in a sewer where a conveniently labelled bucket of \"toxic chemicals\" thrown in Jason's face blinds and disorients him long enough to not be able to catch up with the final couple. As they climb to safety, the millions of tons of highly toxic waste that they apparently pump through the NYC sewers nightly at midnight dissolves Jason who is caught in its tide.  Apparently a side effect of toxic waste is to dissolve a giant hulking 320lb reanimated corpse to reveal a pristine, slightly chubby kid with no evidence of the birth defects his character has always shown. Final couple is penniless and without ID in the middle of Manhattan, but that's alright, their dog has caught up with them and all ends well.\n\nThe synopsis provided (you're missing nothing by knowing the plot, you're there for the nudity and violence) should be enough to decide you really only want to see this because you lost a bet, for completeness of having seen the entire series, or because you have a lot of liquor and like to heckle bad movies. You're going to be disappointed. \n\nThere is a brief glimpse of one set of breasts, and apparently the movie makers were told they could use, IN TOTAL, exactly one cup of stage blood for the entire production. Bodies get punctured through completely in a bloodless fashion. A throat is slit without a trace of red and we next see the dead man in a pristine uniform in a completely clean room. \n\nDoes the acting save the production? Apart from Kane Hodder, whose hulking, menacing Jason brings a raw physicality to the character - no. Teenage girls see a man they absolutely know to be a homicidal unstoppable zombie and give out the barest cry in response, run twenty yards and stop, looking vaguely concerned. The series had got so lazy that they simply set up \"set piece\" characters and had them play their roles as expected by the franchise's tropes (the constantly angry overprotective father, the Pat Benetar rock chick,  the yokel who tells them they're all doomed, the mean girls, the cocky jock, the town's easy girl, etc.) with absolutely no development or rhyme or reason to what they're doing.\n\nTo give you an idea of how unrealistic all this is - there's an early scene in which a young man gets his date naked on a pleasure craft, pilots it into an area known to be the haunt of multiple gruesome mass murders, dresses up as the person responsible to scare his date, and then expects her to actually sleep with him immediately afterwards. And she does.\n\nThe whole thing feels tired, forced, contractually obligated, and an illustration of the old saying \"anything not worth doing at all is not worth doing properly\". Even Fred 2: Night of the Living Fred is more entertaining than this, and that's saying something.",

It is the eighth installment in the ‚ÄòFriday the 13th' film series. It's another attempt to shake some life into the franchise, relocating Jason to a major city for the promise of unmitigated slaughter. Also, for some reason that is never fully explained our main character keeps having visions of young Jason drowning in the lake.\nThe film follows Jason Voorhees stalking a group of high school graduates on a ship on route to, and later in, New York City.\nEverybody was okay in this movie. They did what they needed to do for a slasher movie, and I was okay with that. No stand outs, good or bad.\nThere are two main problems in this movie. First, the film lies to us saying ‚ÄòJason Takes Manhattan', since he's ship-bound for all but the final half-hour, and he doesn't really concern himself with anyone apart from the vessel's survivors once he's there. This is a guy who's made a habit of ruthlessly killing everyone he's ever encountered, yet now he passes harmlessly through a loaded subway car and cheerfully lifts his mask to scare a gang of punks trying to pick a fight with him. It just didn't make any sense. The second is the fact that the production value in this movie went down hill since the last. The effects are god awful and Jason looks like he should be on the Muppets! When he takes his mask off in this movie I laughed, it was so bad.\nOverall, I didn't get any enjoyment out of this movie. I love the character of Jason, but this movie turned him into an average stalker with violent tendencies rather than a ruthless killer we are used to.\n1/5",

The direction also does not help his cause as he seems even more supernatural then normal. The story is a paint by numbers Friday the 13th story. Jason gets revived, runs amok, murdering without abandon, adults are skeptical, small group goes after Jason only to be picked off one by one, main characters inexplicably survive to thwart Jason (usually using water). There are so many entertaining moments in this movie, the death of the rock star girl with her own guitar, watching New Yorkers ignore 2 teenagers running terrified from a masked marauder, the moronic nature of Julius believing he can punch out Jason then drops the line of the movie, \"Give me your best shot, motherf*cker.\", then proceeds to be decapitated with a single punch and the various psychedelic images of young Jason Voorhees tormenting Rennie. This is Jason at the height of his teleportation abilities. Nightcrawler would be envious at just how easy he makes it seem. Lastly, despite the lacklustre murders and squandering of the possibilities of Jason being both on a boat with his victims and dropped off in Manhattan with a city full of possible victims, this film is entertaining and concludes well, allowing for the 9th instalment to delve into those simple images if it so chooses.",

Jason (Kane Hodder) comes back from the bottom of Camp Crystal Lake and hitches a ride on a bunch of Senior's Grad Party which is on a ship heading toward New York. On a side note is it actually worth calling a movie \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" when in fact they are only in Manhattan for roughly 25 minutes near the end of the film? Anywho we follow along a girl afraid of swimming named Rennie (Jensen Daggett) who is a bit of a loner. Along for the ride is also her uncle Charles (Peter Mark Richman) who is a biology teacher at the school and very hard on Rennie. Then there's Sean (Scott Reeves) who is the captain of the ship's son...who also doesn't have the easiest life. Anyways Jason starts taking down a slew of kids on the ship and eventually they make it to Manhattan where I gotta say is absolutely nuts. There's scenes of him chasing Sean and Rennie through the streets, subways of New York and hundred of people see him, but he only wants to kill the two kids? Maybe it's something where you only die if you're from the Crystal Lake area. Rennie herself keeps having visions of Jason as a kid and when you find out the explanation it seems very forced. Anyways the film has some super cheesy moments, terrible dialogue and a lead that is not very convincing (she was 26 years old when filming and looks nothing like a teenager). One positive thing I will say is that Jason is absolutely brutal in this one and pretty much at his best. The powers that be wanted to switch the formula and put Jason in a new area, but wow did this not work.",

Kane Hodder returns for his second appearance as Jason, although I still don't know exactly what it is about his performance that fans consider him to be the definitive Jason. It may more have to do with the story than Hodder's performance in that with the prior film the producers seemed to finally figure out the \"rules\" for Jason (supernatural, mutated under the hockey mask, always wet, is a big chest breather). He still isn't really a character in the traditional sense, but he was at least consistent for the four films that Hodder appeared in as a hulking force of nature that cannot be stopped or reasoned with. In this entry, a group of teens take a party boat downriver, but have an unexpected stowaway in Mr. Voorhees, which for the first hour becomes a low rent ripoff of \"Alien\" with junky riverboat instead of a spaceship for the monster to take out the passengers one by one. Jason and company don't even reach Manhattan until the last half hour of the film, but once they do, you do get to see Jason saving a woman from a would-be rapist, fight a boxer on a tenement rooftop, and you even get to see him scare some punks in a filthy pre-Giuliani Times Square. The boat portion of the film isn't all that good, but I did enjoy Jason chasing hapless teens through moving subway trains and through the mean streets of the Big Apple. Nothing brilliant here, but for fans of slasher films, this one isn't completely awful.",

And when Jason does indeed get to Manhattan, he still focuses on the same group of people he's been trying to kill on the ship, it's just that they manage to row a lifeboat there.  Admittedly, out of all of the Jason films I've seen recently, this is the least inspired and easily the worst.  I reviewed the seventh film in the franchise poorly because of the introduction of telekinetic elements from one of the people Jason is trying to kill.  But, and I'll readily admit that the telekinesis was fucking stupid, at the very least they made an effort to introduce some newer elements in order to try to freshen up what was, at the time, an old and tired franchise.  This, on the other hand, just goes back to basics with Jason killing random teens for no real purpose whatsoever.  It doesn't try to freshen up the formula in any way whatsoever.  Again, the telekinesis was stupid, but at least it was a somewhat inspired idea.  The  fourth film at least introduced a character that would be carried for two sequels, somewhat, making it a trilogy.  The seventh film had telekinesis which, while stupid, did bring in a new element.  This movie, really, just rests on the laurels established by the previous films in the franchise.  And it's really just not a very good movie at all.  Like you can just see that they had run out of ideas by this point and this was the best they could do.  You gotta understand that, at the time of its release, this would've been the 8th Friday the 13th movie in 9 years.  That's a little over a year between each installment.  So of course, by the eighth film, you're just sort of grasping for straws and finding ways to keep a successful franchise going on, even if that means putting out an uninspired and lazy cash grab.  While I can see some people getting some enjoyment out of this film as a B-movie, it's just not as entertainingly bad of a movie as the last Jason movie I reviewed.  It's just bad.  Though there is one hilarious death scene.  So there's this character who's an amateur boxer.  Somehow, I forget how, him and Jason end up on an apartment building's rooftop.  The amateur boxer then proceeds to attempt to kill Jason by punching him like 200,000 times in a row.  The stupidity of which is astounding in and of itself.  This guy doesn't go down with gunshots, you think he'll go down with punches?  It doesn't end there.  So, of course, the punches don't do jack shit to Jason, all they do is tire the boxer out.  So Jason pulled out the patented Ali rope-a-dope, where he just let the guy punch himself out, and, for some reason, I thought that was funny.  The boxer eventually gives up and tells Jason to hit him with his best shot, or something like that.  Jason proceeds to punch the guy upside the head so hard that he decapitates him.  It was fucking hilarious.  And that's really the only death that's really all that memorable.  None of the others feel like they had much effort or thought put into them.  The acting is pretty bad, the logic is awful.  I mean, what do you really expect?  Not to mention the fact that the movie is longer than it should've been.  100 minutes for a Jason movie?  Fuck that.  85 at the most, keep it short and sweet.  So, yea, this isn't very good.  It's a stupid movie, but, sadly, it's not an enjoyably stupid one.  I cannot recommend this.",

It was the last Friday the 13th film Paramount Pictures released before selling the rights to New Line and the final installment of the 1980s, a decade whose economic excesses made this bounty of sequels possible. While I'm extremely grateful that Jason Lives and The New Blood were so good their high water mark makes this sorry finale all the more disappointing.\n \nI'll start with the most obvious point: Jason in New York City is a dumb idea. As I've written several times already these movies are painfully formulaic so it's perfectly understandable that the filmmakers would want to change things up. I'm all for it so long as you aren't playing fast and loose with an already perfect creation as Mr. Hedden has done here. Jason leaving the camp is fine but why take him to New York? How about a neighboring town or something? Not only is it cheesy but budget and logistical restraints severely limited filming time in NYC which is why most of the movie takes place on a boat or in alleyway scenes shot in LA and Vancouver. If you're going to do something idiotic at least see it through properly.\n \nThe boat trip to New York brings up an interesting question in itself. We know from the first film that Camp Crystal Lake is in New Jersey so please tell me what large body of water the cast is crossing to get from there to New York City. Did they venture out into the Atlantic Ocean and go around the island of Manhattan in some kind of perverse scenic route? Did anyone at Paramount consider that this made no sense before putting a multi-million dollar film into production? I'm baffled.\n \nAs for the film itself Jason Takes Manhattan is easily the worst in the series up to this point. The only positive is the return of Kane Hodder as Jason, everything else is a total disaster. The plot, dialogue, and performances are pitiable and Jason's makeup design is a joke. He spends the whole movie covered in unexplained slime and the mask used for his exposed face at the end of the movie is laughable. Jason is also now able to vanish and almost instantly reappear in another location like The Flash, when did that start?\n \nThis movie was so bad that the franchise rights were quickly sold and four years passed before the release of the next film, the longest gap between installments at that time. I suppose that's in keeping with the cycle of this series, you get two or three good ones before something inexcusably awful follows. That means we're in for another series reboot, I can't wait.",

Jason on a cruise ship with hundreds of victims in his clutches, while on his way to a murder spree in the big apple. Well they screwed it up pretty horribly.

The characters are far more generic than in other installments of the series, the dialog is awful, and the plot is incredibly boring. And to add to the horrible writing, the acting is pretty bad too. The gore is pretty much nonexistent besides a painfully cheesy decapitation scene and the one cool death scene in the movie involving a sauna. Overall the movie feels incredibly censored and goofy. It really gives off a TV movie vibe. What really irks me is that this wasn't to low budget. Compared to other films in the series this one isn't low budget! It's four or five times more expensive than the best Jason films! So this is by far the worst film in the series. Though I do have to say most of the New York part is actually quite enjoyable, the only part of the movie that really shines. 34/100",

I like how it goes from crystal lake to a boat to a small cruise ship  to a tiny boat cruising to new York city to a dumpy harbor to Manhattan to the sewers felt like an adventure a little long though",

The film is obviously the eight installment of the franchise surrounding Jason Voorhees, the hockey masked killer played by Kane Hodder (Freddy vs Jason, Hatchet). I confess that I have a soft spot for the genre, for me this movie is pure cheesy entertainment. To be honest, it lacks a lot of credibility and good acting. But what to expect from a movie where horny teenagers fall victim to a monstrous serial killer? \n\nWhen a young couple drops the anchor of their boat, so they can make love, the anchor gets stuck on a electric wire on the bottom of the lake. This causes to reanimate the rotting corpse of local legend Jason Voorhees (Hodder), who immediately begins to kill again. The following morning, the SS Lazarus takes sail towards New York. On board is the graduating senior class of the Lakeview High School and their chaperoning teachers Charles McCulloh and Colleen Van Deusen. As the teenagers party on (including drugs and sex), another passenger gets on board. One by one, students begin to disappear...",

Everything is wrong with this movie, even the freaking title. Jason does not take Manhattan in this movie. All he really does is chase two people the entire time he's in New York. Anyway, that's the least of this movies' problems. Wanna know how Jason comes back in this movie? It's the most ludicrous one yet! He comes back by being electrocuted by a random electric pipeline on the bottom of the lake and the only reason that pipe shocked him was because some random people on a random boat just happened to drop the anchor in exactly the right place to cut the pipe. I'm not making this up, though I wish I was. Next we have Jason killing people on a cruise boat. I don't know why he decided to get on a cruise boat (probably because the script called for it), but that's not the main issue. Jason is literally never seen, despite the fact that it's a fairly small ship and despite the fact that he killed like four people. HOW DID NO ONE SEE HIM!? It kills me to even try and think about it! Okay next we have bad acting blah, blah blah, the standard Jason won't die, blah, blah, blah, and of course the idiots being idiots.

            "content": "I didn't think it was possible for Friday to make an installment worse than Part 5...but they did. This movie is hands-down the worst of the franchise. What in god's name were they thinking? Only watch if you are trying to watch them all, otherwise avoid. \n\nOh. The icing on the cake of the terrible movie is that it's boring. I wanted so badly to turn this snoozefest off 30min in. \n\nReview Points:\n\n- I really liked Part 7 and came into Part 8 fairly excited to see the final girl, Tina, back in action (or at least included in some way) However, Friday 8 has absolutely nothing to do with Part 7. It is the only film in the franchise (to this point) that doesn't follow any of the storylines established in previous movies: no flashbacks or continuity in any way. Extremely, extremely, extremely, extremely disappointing.\n\n- The film take place, for 75% of the film, on a boat. It is very claustrophobic and \ncompletely eliminates any idea that Jason can actually stalk his victims...like in all 7 of the previous films. On that point, the \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" title is very misleading. He's in New York only for the last 30 or so minutes.\n\n- Did not understand the main plot of the movie, at all. Apparently, the final girl of the movie had a near-drowning experience cause in part by a chance encounter with the young, child Jason (chronologically, this makes no sense) Anyways, this event scarred her to the point she now sees visions of child Jason everywhere she goes. (by the way this child Jason looks absolutely nothing like the disfigured version presented in the first 5 or so films)\n\n- By far, the worst production value of any Friday film which is surprising because it had the biggest budget of any Friday film before it. This looks like a made-for-tv film.\n\n- BY FARRRRRRRRRR, the worst acting of any Friday film. Where in the hell did they find these actors?\n\n- Jason no longer sports the bad ass costume design from the previous film (exposed ribs, spine, etc). He looks pretty awful, to honest.\n\n- Lots of boring kills. I did like the \"Jason x Julius\" boxing match kill. I genuinely laughed-out-loud.\n\n- Really funny scene where some NY punks try to pick a fight with Jason and he scares them away. This scene coupled with the boxing match kill (and the film's title) seemed like Friday was intended, at some point, to be a parody/comedy, but never stuck with it. Instead, the movie is overly serious with a few comedic scene sticking out like sore thumbs.\n\n- I don't want to sound like a pervert, but one of my biggest guilty pleasures of the Friday the 13th franchise was it's emphasis on attractive girls and a healthy amount of sex/nudity. It made the Friday the 13th films feel like old exploitation films they played at grindhouses in the 70's. But, Friday has drastically removed that aspect since Friday 5. Friday 8 has but a few seconds even hinting that the teens are \"sex crazed\" and wild.",

The kitchens are empty, the engine room is unmanned and there's no cabin crew, so either the company that runs it is soon to go bankrupt and this is the last voyage, or the movie has nothing but contempt for its audience.

This is one of the worst of the series in my book and definitely the worst of the original Paramount series before New Line took over in 1993. The film opens with two horny teens in a boat on Crystal Lake. While they do what horny teens do, their anchor pulls and rips an underwater electrical cable which, when striking the chained and submerged Jason (from Part 7), revives him once again. After slaughtering the two teens, he apparently pilots the craft (quite a skilled zombie, isn't he?) to what appears to be Nova Scotia or someplace and relocates himself on a larger party cruise ship filled with teens on a graduation trip to NYC. Obviously Jason starts slaughtering the youths as the ship sails through a massive storm... didn't the organizers of this trip check the weather reports?... and then pursues the survivors into Manhattan for the last act. Yes, Jason only takes Manhattan in the last half hour of the movie. Will they escape from the hockey mask wearing killer or will Jason finally get to live his dream of appearing on Broadway?... do we care anymore? As written and directed by Rob Hedden (who?) this is simply an awful movie and as one of the longest in the series, a chore to sit through. The tone of the film is deadly serious and taking Jason out of his usual setting works against it, removing the series feel rather then freshening it up. The kills are bit more vicious but, since the characters are really dull and lifeless, you really don't care about their fates. The plot is riddled with far more holes then acceptable in this kinda film. Jason not only seems to have intimate knowledge of the layout and working of a ship he's never seen or been on before but, also seems to have the power to appear anywhere he wants at will... even in Manhattan, he always appears where the characters run to, despite never having been far from Crystal Lake all his life. The cast are especially bland too. Leading lady Jensen Daggett as Rennie is cute but, doesn't endear to us and her character's fear of water is given a connection to Jason that makes no sense and ultimately has no bearing on the plot. Scott Reeves is lifeless as the son of the boat captain and Rennie's love interest and the characters have no chemistry and it doesn't click. Renown TV actor Peter Mark Richman is one of the chaperones and Rennie's jerk of an uncle and his character is completely generic as the stereotypical 'adult jerk' and the actor does the best he can with a thinly written role but, to no avail. Jason is again portrayed by Kane Hodder who is doing this heavy breathing thing which makes no sense as, at this point, Jason has been dead for sometime and has no need to breath... especially not like he has asthma. Is being away from Crystal Lake causing a panic attack? The rest of the cast, including a young Kelly Hu, are totally bland and forgettable. The most interesting of Jason's victims is guitar playing metal chick, J.J. (Saffron Henderson) but, she is the first to go. Good move. Add a ridiculously cartoonish... and as a Jersey boy who loves his NYC, a bit offensive... portrayal of New York City as a dirty cesspool filled with degenerates, drug addicts, gang members and toxic waste, and the film is a dull, lifeless affair that makes boring use out of it's only new touch which is setting a Friday The 13th movie on a boat and then Manhattan... which doesn't work anyway. Why would Jason voluntarily leave the familiarity of the only place he knows as home? And the segment in Manhattan just seems made up as it goes along... did we need to stop the film dead for an attempted rape of Rennie by stereotypical drug addict/gang members?... and even the ending is just plain dumb and if it had remained the last film, would have been a completely unsatisfying way to put the iconic Jason to rest. A really awful and dull entry with very little to recommend even to hard core fans of the series. Jason would stay at rest until 4 years later when New Line Cinema would purchase the rights and try their hand at breathing new life into a dead series. The series his rock bottom with this one.",

The characters are out there, some were really likeable and some were simply atrocious. I liked Jensen Daggett as Rennie, a down to earth and refreshing final girl in my opinion. The opening sequence was fantastic and while most part of the film takes place on a boat, I still enjoyed it for what it was. The death scenes were just good, some make-up effects looked very cheap and plain bad though. It took a long time for them to actually get to Manhattan, and when they did we only get to see like 10 minutes... That was pretty dissapointing. The acting was alright, some of the actors stood out while some fell flat. I still think this movie has lots of problems, like its script, editing and pacing. The story was nothing special, some of the aspects were pretty interesting however. The soundtrack is fun and the final act is great. Definitely not one of my very favorite installments of the Friday the 13th franchise, but definitely not one that deserves all the hate its getting. In my opinion Part III is still the worst of the franchise. Jason Takes Manhattan is cheesy and over the top and filled with some bad one-liners, but its worth watching for the deaths, the amazing Kane Hodder and New York alone.",

No better feeling than getting introduced to all of them, saying which one is your favorite, and then seeing them axed off. (PUN...Kinda. She Jason gets her with a guitar). I knew going in that this was less \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" and more \"Jason takes a boat going to Manhattan' so that didn't bother me as much as it should have and once we actually got to NYC things got pretty good, it picked up, got more interesting, was more humorous, more solid kills, but that was at almost the one hour mark in an hour and forty minute movie. So the third act is pretty solid but the majority of the movie is the boat trip which drags and when there is  the action going on jut isn't that good, yes  it has a few good moments but all around it's kind of eh.

The actors have an exuberance characteristic of when a group of children get together with their cheap videocamera and make their own film. As a result, there's a bizarre sense of joy one gets watching this movie. Unfortunately, the performances are uniformly awful, and Rob Hedden's direction couldn't be any more inept. Anything good--a stray shot or murder set-piece--probably happened by accident. The staging of ANY scene suggests that the production had only one camera to work with--one particularly embarrassing has Jason step out behind someone in a long shot, CLEARLY hit his actor's mark, and then wait for the other actor to turn around and notice him. No cuts. No dynamism. Just inept awfulness, which can become awesome after a while as long as your movie isn't boring. And I will give F:13 that: it never bored me.\n\nBut Holy Hell, nothing in this disaster makes any sense. I can forgive Jason being resurrected by electricity. Whatever. I can't forgive a cruise ship with only three crewmen (one of whom disappears out of the movie for forty minutes, works in the engine room, and never notices an obvious dead body in plain view for hours), Jason inexplicably teleporting, humans who never have a single recognizable human reaction to ANY situation, a New York made up almost entirely of Vancouver back alleys, a graduating class of forty students one minute and then ten the next, shitty make-up and special effects, the idea that toxic waste is flushed out through NYC's sewers every night...at MIDNIGHT, characters doing the most stupid things possible, etc etc etc.\n\nHowever, I think the film gets the extra half star for the epic scene where boxer Julius rouses his classmates to hunt Jason (\"Let's get this muthafucka before he gets us, huh?!\") and then tells his biology teacher that \"School is OUT!!\" This scene is the entire movie in a microcosm: no clear line of thought or action, no commitment to even a basic sense of realism (the other F:13s had this), and a complete disregard for competent storytelling. Consider this too: just one scene prior, a character's father has been killed, and in the next one he seems to have forgotten that completely.\n\nAnyway, good for a laugh.",

The majority of the film doesn't even take place in NY. It takes place on a boat headed there from somewhere near Camp Crystal Lake. Jason's body was at the bottom of the lake, the anchor of a boat 'accidentally' hits an electricity line and then his body, electrocuting his body which somehow brings him back to life without also electrocuting the boat. Then he goes on his usual slasher journey on the boat, conveniently filled with high school grads. This was the least believable of all the situations in the entire series, in my opinion. There were also very little special effects in the scenes where he kills his victims. So it wasn't very fun to watch. To top it all off, it's longer than the previous movies.

It lacks tons of logic, is completely incompetent, & I have no idea what the hell the director was doing throughout the movie.\r\n\r\nI sat through every Friday the 13th movie during AMC's marathon of the franchise (I wanted to watch The Walking Dead, but this crap was on & there was also nothing else to watch during then before we got a DVR so I could watch the better stuff), & they are all the same crap (I missed one, though). So I'm just wondering how is it that this franchise has some following & adoring fans. Yes, Jason is rather kick-ass, but he isn't that great to begin with, in fact he's just a simple-minded  buffoon, just like his movies.\r\n\r\nAs I said, all of the movies in the franchise are the same plot formula & script, & they all just get worse with every installment (except for the Bay reboot which was slightly better than them, but nothing too great to say the least). We get a cast of nobody's & no-one-cares-about characters. The main character & the side character are introduced, & there, the rest of the characters will obviously get brutally killed by Jason, & the plot just remains the same.\r\n\r\nBut Jason Takes Manhattan not only repeats everything I just said, but it also just does them worse & it almost feels like some parody of the franchise.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the good majority of the film doesn't even take place in Manhattan, but some shitty cruise ship. Secondly, the characters in here are all half-witted imbeciles; not to mention that the main character has some fear of water (oh how hilarious it is that she had a room beneath the ship). And thirdly, the film's execution is a joke. One big hilarious joke.\r\n\r\nThere is no directing, no style, no substance, no quality cameras, no listenable dialogue, no characters, no brains, & no fun. How this movie even managed to be cooked up & released into theaters is beyond me (though it hilariously flopped).",

The entire plot is just bad. The main character once again has some kind of mind power, although in this one it is really subtle and cannot be used as a weapon. Did they not notice that it didn't work the last time? Included with this Jason is has become almost like a ghost, haunting the memory of the main character and disappearing in the blink of an eye.

But in my opinion this has got to be the worse entry in the series.  The plot is miniscule, and only barely takes any notice of the history of the preceding movies, and in one respect completely changes a physical character trait that dates right back to the first installment!  The cast of characters are all completely disregardable and even their (particularly bloodless) demises are forgotten as soon as they have happened, but Kane Hodder still manages to bring some welcome animation to the main character.  Even the movie's title is misleading as when the action (finally) moves to Manhattan, Jason not so much \"takes\" it, but more wanders right past hundreds of potential victims to chase after the remaining kids, for what is really no apparent reason.  And then there is the finale that really makes no sense whatsoever!

This is one also has a pretty like cast, the stand-out is the mean-spirited high school principal (Peter Mark Richman). Director Hedden does have some nice visual moments in the movie.

Despite its detractors and the hardcore fan community seemingly hating it outright, I'll admit that I kind of like Jason Takes Manhattan more than The New Blood. At the time this film was released, the Friday the 13th series had become stale. If they were going to do another film, they needed to do something pretty risky, and there's no mistake about it: Jason Takes Manhattan IS a risky film, but unfortunately it's a risk that didn't pay off. For starters, it was nice that we weren't stuck on dry land at a summer camp or a similar location again. We've seen that so many times, not to mention the cavalcade of other slasher films doing the same thing over and over again. It was definitely time for a different setting. It's basically the same plot of murdering a bunch of teenagers (or anyone else that gets in Jason's way), but it's more appealing visually. Overall, the film seems more creative and a bit more engaging than most people give it credit for. That being said, yes, the film definitely has a lot of flaws. A plethora of questions seem to pop up in most of our minds when we see the film. Since when is Crystal Lake connected to a waterway that leads out to sea? Why does Jason revert to a little boy at the end of the film? Why doesn't the ship start sinking despite taking on all that water? Since when did Jason learn to teleport? Why did the captain not bleed when his throat was slit? Why was Tamara even allowed on the boat in the first place if she hadn't completed her senior project? If Renny is only hallucinating because of her trauma as a child, then why does her dog see her hallucinations too? Why do the sewers of New York flush out toxic waste every night? All of these questions have been burning up fans for years, including myself, and contribute to the film's overall dislike. In my opinion, it was a huge mistake on Paramount's part to do that. If it had been titled something like \"Jason's Final Voyage\", \"The Final Friday\", or anything else that didn't have Manhattan or New York in the title, I think it might have fared a bit better than it did. Despite all of its problems, the film is much more entertaining for me, and is FAR better than what came next.",

As almost every review every written for this film will tell you, the movie should have taken place in New York more. Instead we get an hour of predictable blood sheds on a cruise (which also foolishly suggests Camp Crystal Lake is connected to the ocean) before the cast finally gets to New York in the final half hour. Cast is pretty bland outside of a hilariously high strung performance by Peter Mark Richman, and Kane Hodder who once again proves he's the scariest Jason. Also the first 'Friday' film to have comedy override the suspense. Some bad special effects such for lame kills and the worst Jason face in the series combined with poor acting and film decisions makes this installment edge out part five as the worst in the series to date. Although on the plus side I did appreciate the humor in portraying New York as a dirty, graffiti ridden city. Poor ending featuring an unexplained transformation of Jason to his former child self.",

In every previous film Jason has killed indiscriminately, so naturally he'd tear through Times Square on a murderous rampage, right? No, he continues to chase the same handful who were on the boat and pretty much ignores the other 20 million. The action stays small in scope, mostly confined to dark alleyways.

I really didn't enjoy this movie so far there was nothing interesting at all with this movie and there's no gore and a few amount of scares there was nothing interesting at all. The story is kinda cool Our serial killer now leaves Camp Crystal Lake and he heads to Manhattan that was pretty good although the climax of this movie seriously falls flat after a great opening resurrection of Jason Voorhes and two impressive kill scenes but the later on half of the movie seriously was a letdown. It has some of the best kills but they aren't gory or bloody as Part 7 The New Blood or Jason Goes to Hell. Kane Hodder still manage to make Jason come to life though it was really nice that he still knows how to handle his acting as Jason Voorhes since he was good in part 7 he was also good in part 8 even the other casts in the film. It was too bad this movie is a big failure in the Friday the 13th franchise so far. The other thing I dislike about part 8 is Jason's makeup it looks really bad his face looks like dumb molded clay and the makeup wasn't as good as in Part 6, 7 and the reboot here all of the make up seriously ruined everything. I really didn't like this movie so far although it was way better than part 4, 5 and the dumb Jason X although Part 6 and 7 are the best in the series so far.  It was too bad that Director Rob Hedden had so many faults in the film he acknowledged them and I heard that the setting would have been in New York but I heard that they had various scheduling conflicts and problems during the making of the film so far. It was too bad that Jason Takes Manhattan made the least amount of money in the Friday the 13th Franchise so far. Director Rob Hedden tried his best so far to make the series succesful so far. Overall I would give this movie a 5/10 because the movie has a very nice and keen plot but the movie doesn't have enough gore or scares and the movie falls flat in a series of routiness like Jason's bad makeup and a boring climax towards the film but it was way better than part 4, 5 and Jason X.",

It's been a few years since Jason was done for in the disappointing New Blood. Now, Jason has been brought back to life due to an accidental cut in an electrical cord under the lake. The electric surges through his body bring him back to life. Before this happens, we get views of New York City from the ocean view to the alleys, time square, and subways. It is then title appears with cheesy and horrible 80s music in the background. Wow, Jason will go to Manhattan? This was a period when variety began to consume in the Friday the 13th films. After a fresh start, Jason went on to battle telekinetic girl right before going to New York City and sent to perdition. \r\n\r\n3D had a lot of insulting 3D and amateurish, but it was iconic. \r\nFinal Chapter was great in special effects, but its characters were inept. \r\nNew Beginning was a lot of fun despite the awfulness. Three cheers for gratuitous nudity. \r\nJason Lives franchise brought him back to life with new powers and super strength. It was written and directed by Tom McLoughlin. \r\nNew Blood installment removed any sort of intelligence for the characters and mixed in with a cheesy 80s teenage drama with a Carrie White girl rip-off. \r\nFriday the 13th has a lot of improvements as it takes material from the first four and gives Jason a personality although it still lacks suspense and doesn't bring anything new. \r\n\r\nNow, we have Jason Takes Manhattan which a title like that would bring a lot to mind like seeing Jason walking around the streets of Manhattan slashing and dicing. Heck, he could kill scores of folks while going on to ice ring to take on the Red Wings. As that happens, a number of movie trivia and homage happens with scenes you'll say Taxi Driver, King Kong, Death Wish, and plenty of other great films. As I tell you all this, there is one scene when Jason stops and looks. He stands tall as he sees a billboard with a hockey mask. Yes, this should have been Jason's finest moment in the series and maybe in the movie, but once again, bad writing, acting, and directing stand in the way. Incompetence rules this flick throughout the entire time as the film spends 1 and 10 minutes in a boat while 15 minutes in a studio built alley and 5 minutes in Manhattan. The results are rather humiliating than thrilling or fun. Fans and critic are pretty much in the same page when it comes to it, so why review it anyways? The answer is not to warn people for they have been warned obviously enough, but to give folks a clear insight what I thought about and to complete the Friday the 13th film series. Will I buy it? As completist (not a real word), yes I will buy the deluxe edition since I want to complete the series with Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, and Freddy Kruger (haven't published review). As you know, my recommendation is a no on this film unless you're a hardcore fan. The film's biggest sin is the wasted opportunity. \r\n\r\nThe opening film has a tour on New York City although there are allegations that some of it looks like it's in Vancouver and that's coming from Entertainment Weekly. Anyways, the music plays and narration is given even though I thought the music was all wrong and crap. Anyways, the title appears and we move back into Camp Crystal Lake death place of Jason Voorhees. A boat is in the water and we see underwater that an anchor is trying to grip something. Anchor grips an electrical chord and cuts it giving a short power circuit around it. The noise startles two recent graduate students Jim (Todd Shaffer) and Suzie (Tiffany Paulsen), so Jim goes off to see what it was. Suzie sits in bed waiting for Jim but hears nothing from him and starts to worry as she begins to think about what Jim said. The thoughts revolve around Jason Voorhees and his existence ready to kill any teenager on Manhattan. Suzie walks to the doorway in a t-shirt and panties as pop comes Jim with a t-shirt. Suzie actually falls for the moronic prank as Jim tells her it was only a joke while sporting tighty whities (gag). The two have sex according to formula as Jason takes the hockey mask and arms himself with harpoon gun. He kills Tim and looks at him as Tim tries to make a dramatic and epic death pose. As for his girlfriend, she has taken off as Jason looks around the camp thinking she's gone! Where has she gone too? He walks around the deck and suddenly, wait, I found her! He opens the hatch kills the pleading and helpless Suzie. \r\n\r\nThe following scene takes place in the dock as students get ready to part ways from the hometown to New York. One of the chaperones is Charles (Peter Richman) who comes off a strict man. It is there that we meet another group of high school stereotypes like the nerd, druggy, smart, athletic, macho, and so forth. These characters represent stolen stereotypes based on other popular 80s shows and movies. However, it is Rennie (Jensen Dagget) and Sean (Scott Reeves) the film will concentrate as they develop a relationship despite the Uncle Charles's reluctance. Anyways, the get ready for sail and one of the ship's crews notices a boat appearing in the middle of nowhere despite the presence of folks on the deck. The cockeyed guy does nothing, but tells the folks that they're all doomed. Anyways, the ship sets sails with Sean's father in charge. Originally, Sean was to command, but quit when his dad corrected him. This scene reflects scenarios done a lot better in cheesy episodes and movies about father and son. Anyways, the folks on the ship party, make out, shoot videos, and do drugs. The camera takes a little time to see what each person does right before being killed by Jason. Meanwhile, our final girl, Rennie is having visions and hallucinations of a boy haunting in an unconvincing ways that has me and you guessing have to do with Jason and her past. Jason spends his time around the boat killing folks in some cheap ways while showing audiences his ability to teleport. We have a scene where this Queensryche wannabe girl goes to a steam room only to torture a poor defenseless flying V. She spots Jason and runs downstairs. Jason stands there doing nothing and then appears at bottom of the steam inexplicably. However, it gets better as Jason avenges the flying v by whacking her. \r\n\r\nEveryone on board goes on without noticing her scream except for the cockeyed guy. He does nothing, but says the voyage is doomed without being derision or a drunk. He walks around saying that meanwhile Charles goes around inspecting bad behavior while being overprotective of Rennie as she has vision of a young boy. The captain of the ship and skipper get picked off along with the other folks. Finally, the corpses are discovered, but not in a Nosferatu homage. The guys gather up, so they can go out and kill Jason Voorhees as they arm themselves with weapons. I was annoyed with this because I knew the formula will prevent the folks from actually using their weapons although friendly fire happens. Jason goes off and kills everyone except for a few survivors that include chaperone Charles and Colleen students Sean, Rennie, Julius (thrown overboard), and Toby the dog. The crew escapes through a life and wander through the fog in a convincing scene as everybody sleeps and cheers when they see the Big Apple. \r\n\r\nUpon reaching Manhattan, they get up to the docks believing they are safe, but are ambushed by a two thugs. This trip to Manhattan will be an uneasy one. Rennie is taken and the rest of the group splits to find help. Rennie is injected with some form of drug. Five minutes later, she up on her feet and moving normal. I guess she was injected with some weak stuff. Jason goes off and kills the remaining survivors although avoiding the New Yorkers. It is in the studio built alley that we finally learn what's been bugging Rennie all this time. Her past secret is neither really shocking nor scary and has you noddin' uh-huh. We have Jason pursuing the survivors in different areas with my favorite scene that involves a moronic gag with a boom box that was actually filmed in Manhattan. Chaos and suspense starts to appear in the film. Rennie and Sean go into the sewers to escape him where the scene kills the momentum that was built. The scene involves Rennie dumping a bucket of toxic waste into Jason sending him screaming and taking his mask off. The face appearance of Jason becomes irritating and offensive to look at. The film ends in a horrible note that brings closure to Rennie and Jason Voorhees.  \r\n\r\nWatching this flick, I believe writer and director Rob Hedden set out to destroy the franchise. If I knew this was going to be a stinker, I would have traveled back in time and force him to change the location to New Jersey. Jason Takes New Jersey with a scene involving Jason killing a man by pushing him into a bathtub filled with water, ha ha. So, this is just water! It's not just water. It's New Jersey water! Oh no! Aghhhhh! The guy dissolves in the New Jersey water along with a New Jersey death style. Kidding. The film's problem also revolves around the fact that the film takes much of in the boat; therefore, the flick is really Jason Terrorizes Love Boat. The fans and critics of the series know this by heart along with the unfortunate viewers who saw this, so it leads to a poor performance at the box office. The film ranks as one of the lowest in profits with a 5 million dollar budget. I'm not surprised. The characters are pretty much the same as the play the stereotype they're to play along with annoying performances and predictable outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe film is wretched upon the weak acting throughout the entire film as characters will shout or say a line, but leave an awkward pause in the middle. Kane Hodder (Jason Voorhees) is nearly the only one who can act because he doesn't deliver a line throughout the film. Even Peter Richman does a terrible job, you think cause of his age he would do a decent job, but he stinks as well. I recently reviewed Halloween- the Curse of Michael Myers and that flick was incompetent, but Donald Pleascene was brought some light to the dying film with his performance. Here we have nearly nothing to look forward in the characters. The cockeyed geezer annoyed me, so did the kid playing Jason Voorhees. One scene, we see the boy with a deformed right eye, but then he appears with a deformed left eye. I got annoyed how we get a fake and poorly acted drowning scene with him. Also, I was pretty unsurprised with the repressed memory Rennie had as it is connected to Jason. I didn't care much for the gore or death scenes except for the death of Charles (we knew it was going to happen). I was ready to write it off, but a funny thing happen. The scenes of supposedly Manhattan and actual Manhattan came in and saved the film barely to avoid 1. I love a scene where one of the characters decides to fight Jason with a boxing technique. I noticed 2 comical things: 1. Julius was an amateur 2. Those punches were pi*sing Jason. I applauded the scene afterwards. The scenes have suspense in them as Jason pursues his target while taking New Yorkers as the mosquitoes that can't be bothered with. We get a great and stupid gag with a boom box scene as these \"punks\" are listening to rap. There is a fiasco scene where a waitress does a sleazy job at the emergency the kids ask her. This was all pretty fun to watch although I couldn't help noticed that the entire film was a wasted opportunity. Oh and on a special note, I love the logical errors surrounding the film as we see character getting wet from the ocean, but found completely dried in the next scene. \r\n\r\nAs for writer and director Rob Hedden, I am very sure he had a vision, but he wasn't right for the job. Although it's not his fault and we shouldn't hunt him down, I call him to fiction world where a fate like Charles's characters can take place. The music was all wrong too.\r\n\r\nFriday the 13th Part 3- 3D\r\nFriday the 13th- The Final Chapter\r\nFriday the 13th Part V- a New Beginning\r\nJason Lives- Friday the 13th Part VI\r\nFriday the 13th Part VII- New Blood\r\nFriday the 13th Part VIII- Jason Takes Manhattan\r\nJason Goes to Hell: Final Friday\r\nFriday the 13th (remake)",

Its filled with some humor (the most hilarious being when Jason kicks the street punks' radio and scares them away by showing them his face). I adored thye look of Jason, with his golden hockey mask and wet, soggy clothing. Only dislike: The ending. It just does not make sense.

There might be a slightly different rating at the end.\r\n\r\nAlright, time for some...fun??\r\n\r\nThis trailer (from my website)...this trailer represents Jason in a new place. He looks at with confusion, with sadness, with....HATE. Ain't nobody gonna stop Jason!!!!!!!...Or will they?...Alright, time for a little backstory. Paramount Pictures was done with Jason Voorhees for good. They figured if they continued, it would be 80's style films in the 21st century (not a bad idea nowadays.) They figured we would go to Friday the 13th: Part 9000: SOMEBODY BETTER GET HAPPY!!!!!!!!! So, they decided to take him out the right way. It was 1989, the finishment of the 80's. (Yeah, I said finishment.) Now, Jason was ready to go somewhere he would never go before. But would it foreshadow what happened in real life? This gets into the conspiracy that Freddy vs. Jason was planned from the beginning, but let's talk about that later.\r\n\r\nSo how does this movie fair? Well, it starts with something very unusual. In fact, the whole formula for a FT13TH movie is not followed that well, partially because Jason travels in this film. The introduction, however, is a completely broken commentary on how New York City lives. Just...trust me. But it does set a tone, saying \"we're going somewhere new people.\" Or say \"the final Jason.\" By now, true Jason fans were used to everything about Friday the 13th...but was to come. In fact, some say that NYC represents where the series went. I mean, we went from a serious horror film about a mom who had lost her child and vowed revenge, to JASON FIGHTING A PSYCHIC? As much as I loved New Blood, it needed to be put to rest. And what better way then to go the craziest route yet.\r\n\r\nAt first, you feel like the film is going to be extremely cheesy fun. Jason gets re awakened by lightning *cough*PARAMOUNT, HOW MUCH LIKE FRANKENSTEIN DO YOU THINK JASON IS!!!*cough*. Then, he pulls out not the heart, not the brains, not the intestines of a teenager...but what I think is an appendix!!! And I'm just like \"...worst Friday the 13th special effect ever. I love it.\" For a good amount of time, the film remains cheesy. Usual teenager stuff, dealing with the popular peoples, people addicted to just about anything, whether it be their passion of career, drugs, etc. And of course, the evil dads. But it actually turns out to be a scary horror film, with a Metroid style feeling. Basically, Jason says \"You guys are dead and there's nothing you can do about it.\" Technically, they could have called for aerial assistants. \r\n\r\nAnd in this film, you want certain people to live, and certain people to DIE. And, awesomely enough, your wish is granted....sort of. Oh, and if I didn't mention it, this film mostly DOESN'T take place in Manhattan. (STRIKE!) It takes place on a boat. *cough*I'M ON A BOAT!*cough*. And if calls for a great Metroid feeling of loneliness. Only you and other people just as strong as you haft to face an immovable object with no chance for help. I can't explain it well enough. Most likely because I was watching this at 9:30 P.M. after a really long day. We should have the whole month of October off of work and school. \r\n\r\nAnyways, the kills are so awesome. Just, awesome. Gory and crazy. Just how you love these kills. Of course, one of the most famous is where Jason chops a guys head off and it falls off a roof. That just tells you something! But you've heard enough about how scary and how slashey it is. What about the story? Well...ugh...I...ugh....*crawls under his bed*HELP ME!!!!!!!!!! Okay, for serious. There is a REALLY freaky scene that *SPOILERS* is where the character is driving a police car, there's music, it's fast, and all of the sudden the music just stops. It then goes by still pictures showing the girl running over Jason as a child. And Jason just stares and stands...it is the freakiest moment in all of Friday the 13th Paramount besides the original's ending. *SPOILERS OVER.*\r\n\r\nAnd that's where it comes down to. This is my favorite Friday the 13th film besides the original. In fact *SPOILERS* Jason in child form makes several appearances throughout the whole film attacking the same girl. He appears as a ghost, as some sort of demon through a portalX5 through a mirror and holly $#!T. *SPOILERS OVER.* The storytelling in this film, while not that obvious, is the best since the original. And of course, the kills are as awesome as he11. You can tell where this is going. The funniest moment is where Jason sees a poster with a hockey mask, and him and the poster are compared. Just...awesome. It wouldn't be funny if it weren't for the fact it's a psychopathic killer who's having A Big Lipped Trumpet Playing Starving Children Opus Face Moment.\r\n\r\nAlso, this movie is incredibly fast paced compared to the other FT13TH films. Also, also, also, also. CAN I EVER STOP STAYING ALSO? This is patially because of the fact that the characters are NOT annoying, except for the ones that are meant to be annoying (whom die quickly.) And of course, to be a good film about New York City, you need a realistic interpretation of the raccoon trash can named The Big Apple. Check and Mate. And if all this isn't an overload of awesome, Jason's face is a acid trip destruction of Jar Jar Binx and Oscar the Grouch. I know that doesn't sound scary...but it is. (Is this review resembling my To Kill a Mockingbird review at all?) \r\n\r\nThe ending scene... I can't explain it. The only way I can explain is that Jason finally realized there's more to life than to mindlessly kill over vengeance. And he...I'm not gonna spoil it. It's beautiful. Oh wait, was that the ending? I can't remember...yeah. That was the ending. Or was it? Look, it was 10:00 P.M. alright? \r\n\r\nTime for the victim. The slasher aspect? 4.5/5. The story telling aspect? 4/5. It averages to 4.25/5, but is reduced to 4/5 for not taking place in Manhattan that much. It's so awesome though, that I wish I didn't haft to do that. \r\n\r\nI, Da Ca$hman signing off...",

But they go so far downhill it's incredible. Five minutes into Friday The 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan, I knew I was in for a shit-storm.\r\n\r\nAlright. The movie opens with as song about New York City, joined by a montage of the Big Apple, and followed shortly thereafter by a sex scene with two characters I don't know or care about. How does all this tie together? It doesn't. Do we ever hear about these two teenagers engaged in sex after they get killed by Jason? Of course not.\r\n\r\nDuring this opening, we get a long, drawn out bit of exposition for the storyline of Jason Voorhees. This is interesting because I cannot help but wonder what sad sap will attempt to join the Friday The 13th storyline eight films in. As though there is any story at all.\r\nSomething else I really loved about this opening: the girl who just watched her boyfriend(?) get killed didn't even look scared while waiting for Jason come get her. It looked like they left the camera running and she was just staring off into space and decided to throw that shot into the movie. This is the type of film making and acting that we're in for, my dear readers. So bare with me. Oh, and there's still 90 minutes left of this movie.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the movie, the audience is graced with the presence of actors who seem to be reading from cue cards standing on a boat that's on its way to NYC. Oh yes. Don't let the title confuse you; this movie is not set in Manhattan. It's set on a boat going to Manhattan. An easy mistake I am sure.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, we have completely unique characters that people who have watched the series will have never seen before--like the old man who's catch phrase is \"You're all doomed! Doomed!\" Ah, yes, isn't the dialogue just riveting?\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of the most overused line in slasher film history:\r\n\r\n\"Stop screwing/playing/goofing/fooling around, guys!\"\r\n\r\nEvery. Single. Slasher. Film. Has. This. Line.\r\nENOUGH! Think up some new lines!\r\n\r\nYes, my dear readers, Jason Takes Manhattan has the worst screenplay for a Friday movie yet--and that is saying something. For starters, I didn't even know how many people were on the boat. Not only that, I didn't know anyone's name. I did not bother to learn one person's name, that's how captivating and enriching these characters are. All these teenagers' range of character goes all the way from \"only caring about sex\" to \"only caring about sex and drugs.\"\r\n\r\nI guess I wasn't the only one who didn't know anyone on this boat, though. Jason is killing people for a good forty or fifty minutes before anyone even notices that anyone's missing. And remember that this isn't set in cabins out in the woods this time. Now there is no rhyme or reason for why the other characters wouldn't realize that their friends are completely missing and/or dead.\r\n\r\nJust as in the last movie, it amazes me that a movie as plotless as a Friday The 13th sequel would bother to have subplots. This one does, and I couldn't care less about any of them. Plus, they wouldn't tell a story! This film could not tell a story! I kept getting so frustrated that this movie would be so much more concerned with trying to be \"creepy\" than to just tell one goddamn story! Oh, and I put the word \"creepy\" in quotes because what this movie tries to pass as creepiness comes off instead as just plain goofiness. That's the level that we have reached, my dear readers. By the way, the only decent plot thread that the story used was stolen--almost word for word--from an episode of M*A*S*H.\r\n\r\nYou know, calling a film \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" and having the opening montage show clips of NYC would lead me to believe that this movie might, I don't know, take place in NYC. But I'm so use to being let down by the Jason films by this point, I don't even know that I'm going to bother getting upset by this. Did this film have the budget to sink a ship but NOT the budget to take place in NYC? Not that I care, really. This whole movie sinks. The acting's bad, the story's bad, the dialogue is bad... It does have a little bit of the \"dumb fun\" element in it, but it's really being stretched here. This movie just plain sucks.\r\n1/10",

So he goes to Manhattan to turn his life around but to get their he first has to take a love board cruise filled with annoying but seductive high school students and a expressionless teacher who i think is the second best character in the movie. For some reason however the high school girls and Professor Emotionless aren't that welcoming to heavy weight, lumbering zombies wearing hockey masks so Jason just goes around aggressively killing everyone. But like i said before, Jason's the good guy in this one so he doesn't just machete random people to death no, theirs one scene where a girl's on the boat about to get raped and then Jason comes along and helps the girl out by killing the rapists and rescuing her and then killing her, good old Jason. It kinda sucks that Jason is only in Manhattan for only a few minutes at the end and spends most of his vacation on the cruise. So why couldn't they just call the movie \"Friday The 13th's Cruise Ship Vacation\" and then at the end have Jason find out that the theme park that he was planing on going to was closed? I think that actually would of given this movie a higher rating.\r\n\r\nMany people consider this to be the worst or at least one of the worst Friday The 13th Movies, but i think that it's fun to watch only for Jason and the expressionless teacher. Just don't expect to see much of Manhattan in this.",

It seems like the studio hired a writer/director who had never seen these films. And by 1989 that's a little inexcusable. \r\n\r\nSo the plot is about a group of high school graduates that are taking a cruise to New York for the graduation trip. Wish I went Crystal Lake High, I had to go to Hershey Park. Anyway Jason is brought back to life and decides to come along. Most of the teens are killed and then the surviving teens wonder around New York as Jason still pursues them. Eventually they end up in the NY sewer system where \"toxic waste\" is just casually dumped every night. This in turn \"kills\" Jason. THE END.\r\n\r\nI just saved you an hour and a half. \r\n\r\nHere is my biggest problem with part 8. One of the characters in the film is afraid of water, because as a young girl her guardian pushed her into crystal lake to teach her how to swim. Once she's in the water a child 'Jason\" is under the water trying to drown her. \r\nHERE'S THE PROBLEM, If you watch the other movies you'd know that \"Jason\" supposedly drowned in the 1950's. But actually he survived and lived in the woods. All the while his mom is killing counselors he's just kind of hanging back. And watching from the sidelines. Don't know why he did not come forward before hand but whatever. Anyway in parts 2-4 he is going on a rampage before Tommy Jarvis kills him in part 4. So we are lead to believe that before part 6 takes place Jason is in fact a real person. Not the supernatural zombie he becomes in part 6 and continues to be in part 7. So when in this film the little girl see's a young Jason trying to drown her it makes no sense because he shouldn't be this evil force. And when she was young Jason would have been in like his 20's. Anyway what I am trying to say is that in the illogical world of the Friday the 13th films, this one makes the least sense. \r\n\r\n(I might write a blog about how I am chronologically confused by this film series) \r\n\r\nWell until Jason Goes To Hell, where they don't even try to explain how he got back to Crystal Lake, even though he was destroyed by toxic waste in NEW YORK CITY. \r\n\r\nif you are a die hard fan of the film series I know you've seen this one, and I know it's your least favorite. If you've never seen it, I don't suggest seeing it first. I usually tell people to skip this one in the film series. But whatever",

It's chock full of plot holes, terrible acting from the majority of the cast and some very poor kill scenes for a slasher film. It's obvious that film makers were running out of ideas and were struggling to think of anything new.\n\nYou could be forgiven for thinking that the plot line would focus on Jason stalking some teenagers on the streets of Manhattan, hence the title, sadly there is all of ten minutes screen time set in New York. Instead, we the majority of the plot takes place on a cruise liner containing a bunch of high school graduates from Crystal Lake celebrating with a trip to new York. Jason gets on board and begins his usual killing spree. This actually could have been an interesting plot line, a sort of Under Siege with a serial killer, sadly the execution was terrible.\n\nYet again Jason is brought back to life from the bottom of Crystal Lake by resurrection power of electricity. I will remember to get someone to zap me with 9000 volts of electricity when I die, problem solved. The first plot hole is a huge one, the main girl of the film supposedly saw Jason in Crystal Lake when she was a kid. Jason drowned in the 50's, it's now the 80's and she is still a teenager. Her time traveling skills were never explained. She is stalked by ghostly visions of Jason throughout the film, sometime he is deformed, sometimes isn't. Even though these scenes make no sense at least they try to evoke some kind of scary atmosphere. The kill scenes on the boat are original, a guitar and hot stones from a sauna are used, the problem is that they all happen off screen. There is almost zero gore, maybe the problems the previous film had with the MPAA were to blame for this.\n\nOnce we finally get to Manhattan the film picks up hugely. It's great fun seeing Jason stalk around New York with people ignoring him. It's fun and leaves you wondering why they didn't set the whole film there. We do have another problem though; somehow Jason seems to have developed the power of teleportation. One second he is on the streets, the next he is one the tenth story of a building with no explanation how he did it. The climax is very good and but again leaves you thinking what could have been.\n\nKane Hodder plays Jason very well and the makeup effects are top notch again. Sadly it's the misleading title, off screen deaths, poor script and poor acting that let the whole thing down.\n\nBeginning of the end for Jason",

The film certainly doesn't live up to its title well, being more like \"Friday The 13th Part 8: Shipwrecked\" and as much hate as this one gets for being one of the worst, I wasn't able to hate this film. I still hold a great dislike for A New Beginning as the worst of the original 8 films. The film, once again, makes no effort to establish many of the characters well... hell, a bunch die before we even know who the hell they are, who cares? That said, it was a mediocre effort and most of the film is on a boat, so by the time New York makes its appearance, its quite late. It feels much longer than it needs to be because of this time it takes, and you begin to wonder why the hell it took place on a boat to begin with. The deaths are fairly satisfying, a bit bloodier than the censored 7th film, but still very cut down. Dammit, I wish I could see this shit uncut! Anyhow, the kills are okay, and no matter how stupid you think the plot is, it's about as exciting as you could get for a series that's already running itself dry by this time. I wasn't put off with the ending being Jason's final moment. It may have been debatable for the time since it was thought to be the last film, but I know it isn't, so I know this won't be the end. The toxic waste is a cop-out, but oh well, I can do with it. The movie fails to live up to its name which is why its disappointing, and the film drags without much excitement at times, but for the most part I sort of enjoyed it, and its a good change of locations from thew usual cabins on the lakeside stuff.",

The big apple itself proved such an expensive shooting location that the screen time of the city is prattled down to nearly nothing, when the boar full of teens do actually arrive at the city harbor they spend about half an hour running around dark, dank alleys ways that could have been shot in fucking Skagness for all anyone knows, and then after about five mins in Times Square (were Jason very lamely scares off some switchblade wielding, boombox playing 80's punks by pulling up his mask) we then end up in dreary subway tunnels that, once again, could have been and most definitely were filmed somewhere else( i think every inch of NY footage they shot is in this movie, just look at the opening credits bit) The other weird fucking thing is that Camp Crystal Lake is now Camp Ocean Mouth really, as the lake has turned into a huge, almost edge-less horizon surrounded by massive snow peaked mountains in the distance (where ever they shot this is actually quite stunning i must admit) and it connects to the ocean, \"hmm, okay then\"....and we have a almost ocean liner sized ship full of graduating teens setting sail from a huge dockland that has also materialized. Jason tags along of course, after hilarious resurrection by electric volts from a falty underwater power cable ( why did no one go in and retrieve his body?) Jason, now a waterlogged, gooey corpse, grabs onto the anchor and joins the party. He's certainly welcome to the roster of teen meat to butcher, horrible, awful characters all, even by the Friday The 13th series low standard of actual likable human beings. The kills are sort of all over the place in this one too, being one of the series most obvious and severe victims of the MPAA, sometimes you get no pay off to a kill scene build up, like for instance the nasty cokehead bitch, i needed to see her get hers, thats the whole point of her fucking existence in this movie, it's like sex without the climax. But on the other hand when u do actually see the kills they are often so outlandish and ridiculous (the boxing death is especially cartoonish) that you just have to cheer and laugh, plus there are SO many!! (this has the highest single body count of the franchise, Jason really dose kill a fuckload of unlikable folks in this film!) another thing worth pointing out is the outright dive into Nightmare On Elm Street type supernatural sequences and imagery, with the final girls weird, oddly executed connection to Jason and her bizzare visitations of a the undead killing machine in his drowned child form as a ghostly spectre, there.s some groovy effects (the mirror bit) but it's all very half baked and vague, even baffling, like Jason reverting to child form after being hit by an apparently rejuvenating tidal wave of toxic waste, the actual fuck? but like i said, watch it with the right people, in the right atmosphere and knowing what you can and should be looking get out of it (an amazingly trashy, bad, cheesy, poorly acted, cheap, tacky pisstake of a film, with much 80's amp value) and you must be drunk, like really drunk.",

I really had to force myself to watch it and once I finally did it was almost painful to make myself sit through the entire thing. Continuity is probably the film's biggest flaw. When we see young Jason drown, he looks like a normal little boy. Whenever Rennie sees him, however, he suddenly looks like he has down syndrome and like somebody beat him with a 2x4 made from every ugly branch they could get a hold of. On top of that, he pretty much has a different appearance every time Rennie sees him. Then there's the whole Crystal Lake leading into the ocean thing and the ending. Heavens, the ending is just a clusterfuck of retardism. The script isn't so hot either. Julius is probably the best example. After Wayne asks him what weapon he's going to take after they realize Jason is on the ship, Julius replies, \"Nothing,\" then pauses for a moment before following with, \"...but this gun.\" The kills were also lacking. Jason takes a guitar to a girl's head and throws a guy onto an antenna. That's about as inventive as we get this time around. The one enjoyable factor of the film is Kane Hodder as Jason. The scene in Times Square is probably the highlight of the film. It's disappointing that the last film with \"Friday the 13th\" in the title is so bad.",

Even Jason's face when unmasked looked like a cartoon character, and him turning into a kid again was nonsensical. And finally, putting a happy ending in a \"Friday the 13th\" film with a cheesy song is not applicable, because end sequences like that belongs to films like \"Commando\" and other early Schwarzenegger macho-actioners.

The kill scenes are laughable, there is hardly any blood, the best kill is when Jason punches a guys head off and it lands in a dumpster, it made me laugh but not cringe, and what is a horror movie is suppose to do?... Scare you! The only reason to watch this movie would either be to laugh at the stupidities of the things that don't make sense-such as Jason mysterious teleportation ability present in this movie- or because your a fan of the series like me. There is one scene were a girl looks at a puddle and is reminded of when her uncle pushed her into a lake to make her get over her fear of water, why this is important I don't know. at one point, the uncle is says \"lets split up\" and my jaw literally dropped in disbelief. This might sound weird, but how hard is it not to get killed in New york city? just find a large crowed and wait, how hard is that? Overall... I can't believe this movie got made, I could have made it better.",

With actors who are totally out of place and one of the worst heroines in Jensen Daggett, this films performance's are below sub-par.  Outside of the \"boxing match\" death and the sauna scene, even the kills are pretty lame.

            "content": "Watching this flick, I believe writer and director Rob Hedden set out to destroy the franchise. If I knew this was going to be a stinker, I would have traveled back in time and force him to change the location to New Jersey. Jason Takes New Jersey with a scene involving Jason killing a man by pushing him into a bathtub filled with water, ha ha. So, this is just water! It's not just water. It's New Jersey water! Oh no! Aghhhhh! The guy dissolves in the New Jersey water along with a New Jersey death style. Kidding. The film's problem also revolves around the fact that the film takes much of in the boat; therefore, the flick is really Jason Terrorizes Love Boat. Heck, Manhattan looks a lot like Vancourer. The fans and critics of the series knew this by heart, so it leads to a poor performance at the box office. The film ranks as one of the lowest in profits with a 5 million dollar budget. Gee, I am not surprised. The characters are pretty much the same as the play the stereotype they're to play along with annoying performances and predictable outcomes. The film is wretched upon the weak acting throughout the entire film as characters will shout or say a line, but leave an awkward pause in the middle. Kane Hodder (Jason Voorhees) is nearly the only one who can act because he does not deliver a line throughout the film. Even Peter Richman does a terrible job, you think cause of his age he would do a decent job, but he stinks as well. A perfect example of this is Halloween- the Curse of Michael Myers and that flick was incompetent, but Donald Pleascene brought some light to the dying film with his performance. Here we have nearly nothing to look forward in the characters. The cockeyed geezer annoyed me, so did the kid playing Jason Voorhees. One scene, we see the boy with a deformed right eye, but then he appears with a deformed left eye. I got annoyed how we get a fake and poorly acted drowning scene with him. Also, I was pretty unsurprised with the repressed memory Rennie had as it is connected to Jason. I didn't care much for the gore or death scenes except for the death of Charles (we knew it was going to happen). I was ready to write it off, but a funny thing happen. The scenes of supposedly Manhattan and actual Manhattan came in and saved the film barely to avoid 1. I love a scene where one of the characters decides to fight Jason with a boxing technique. I noticed 2 comical things: 1. Julius was an amateur 2. Those punches were pi*sing Jason. I applauded the scene afterwards.The scenes have suspense in them as Jason pursues his target while taking New Yorkers as the mosquitoes that can't be bothered with. We get a great and stupid gag with a boom box scene as these \"punks\" are listening to rap. There is a fiasco scene where a waitress does a sleazy job at the emergency the kids ask her. This was all pretty fun to watch although I couldn't help noticed that the entire film was a wasted opportunity. Oh and on a special note, I love the logical errors surrounding the film as we see character getting wet from the ocean, but found completely dried in the next scene. As for writer and director Rob Hedden, I am very sure he had a vision, but he wasn√¢(TM)t right for the job. Although it√¢(TM)s not his fault and we shouldn√¢(TM)t hunt him down, I call him to fiction world where a fate like Charles√¢(TM)s characters can take place. The music was all wrong too. Where's Agnostic Front when you need them?",

Two thirds of the way through the picture he does manage to visit there and continue in his delightful occupation, but it hardly constitutes full-blown mayhem which the title certainly promises.  What we have is a boatload of highschool seniors who are heading off to New York for their graduation.  As the film opens, a naughty couple are having sex aboard a boat.  They drop anchor and it inadvertently hits a powerline which awakens Jason yet again.  He manages to get on the pleasure cruise ship and subsequently fulfils his tender oath and begins slaughtering the unsuspecting ciphers one at a time.\n\nThis film adds an element that hasn¬ít been as pronounced in earlier installments in the series.  Jason¬ís victims bleat and plea for their lives more in this one and it adds a scintillating element to the story.  Best of all is a scene with the prissy and demonstrably conniving Tamara Mason is taking a shower and Jason comes in to seduce her.  While romance is thwarted and he ends up stabbing her with a shard from a broken mirror.  She cowers, whines, and otherwise puts on a pretty decent show before her unceremonious demise at the hands of her would be suitor.\n\nJason¬ís kills are not very imaginative here and the film definitely lacks style points as the dull, burdensome killings continue unabated.  If only there was a single character worth getting thrilled over than these films would be more vital than they are.  Instead, we are left with characters who, as has almost always been the case, lack a discernible personality that elevates them above the typical kill victim.  Actually, there was a promising character early in the film but Jason spears him within the first ten minutes.  His performance suggests something more than what is generally to be expected in these films.\n\nIn this film a girl named Rennie Wickham (Daggett) is taking the cruise against the wishes of her Uncle Charles McCulloch (Richman), the group¬ís chaperone.  She is haunted throughout the entire film by images of a young Jason who we learn apparently tried to pull her down after Uncle Charles pushed he off the dock intending to teach her how to swim.  She sees him everywhere and it truly twists her melon to the point that she can hardly tell what is real and what is imaginary at some point.  Rennie is a meek girl who is shy and the complete opposite of girls like Tamara, the prom queen who also enjoys a bit of nose candy now and again. Rennie is protected somewhat by Miss Colleen Van Deusen (Bingham), another chaperone who is constantly at odds with Uncle Charles.\n\nOne imagines terrific excitement once Jason finally lands in Manhattan but the result is pretty much a downer.  Yes, he takes care of a couple of junkie thugs, a cop, a bouncer at a bar, and several members of our merry crew who escaped when the ship caught on fire.  But he has so much opportunity to run wild in the streets cleaning up the sewage at every opportunity.  Instead, his focus remains strictly on the last two survivors and he chases them on a subway, through Times Square, and into the sewers.  Again, so many chances are not taken and the end is not particularly satisfying.  \n\nThere is something rather odd about watching Jason perform basic human tasks such as shutting a storage hatch.  Somehow the action is more pronounced, more deliberate, and not without its grace.  It shows an elegance about Jason which he mostly attempts to hide when he¬ís off enjoying the sights and hacking up his chosen ones.  This film shows that Jason has a very focused mind and is not distracted easily by what is taking place around him.  He chases his victims with a strong sense of purpose and never gives up on them.  He knows what he wants and how to get it.  So very few nowadays can say the same thing which makes Jason into a character worth admiring on a certain level.  He¬ís very good at what he does although he does seem to run into some trouble now and again.  No matter, there¬ís always lightning or power surges or a girl¬ís telekinesis to help him out of a tight scrape.\n\nOverall, this film does nothing particularly novel and lacks some of the urgency that has made earlier films in the series more dynamic.  The deaths are rudimentary and the film simply does not live up to its title.  Ultimately, there is little character development which is nothing particularly new for the franchise.  Jason¬ís killing spree seems truncated and could have enveloped so much more if that plot line were pursued.",
