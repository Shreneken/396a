Of course there were things I didn't like, but that's what makes this film great. \nIt's so sad that humans are the real enemies. As soon as nature creates such power, humans want it to become powerful like a god. Can't we just once appreciate the nature and its treasure itself, without destroying it? I guess that's not possible. That's why Laputa needed to be gone for good. I just hope Laputa landed on some other planet, where the citizens treat it good, instead of wanting to rule over the world.\nI loved the pirates the most, although they were a but annoying in the beginning.",

It has a highly imaginative story for starters, every bit as imaginative as Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind's. Once again, the animation is magnificent, as is the haunting and poignant music score. The dialogue and pacing are fine too, and the characters are never devoid of their likability and are wonderfully voiced by a top notch voice cast. Castle in the Sky is an absolutely beautiful film, but it is also quite haunting helped enormously by the music and visuals. It is an amazing and I think unforgettable film, one of the best animes, perhaps even animated movies I have seen. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "There are many parts of the movie that keep me engaged. The music does great at capturing the whimsy of the story even in the darker parts of the film. The main antagonist, Colonel Muska, is voiced by Mark Hamill who does an amazing job to reflecting the cartoonishly evil bad guy hungry for power. He makes an intimidating presence and shows a vast contrast towards the more humorous nature of the soldiers and goofiness of the pirates. The children show a great bond and courage that you would expect from children in an 80s-early 90s fantasy adventure film like Hook or The NeverEnding Story. These characters help give this movie a very charming quality to it along with the steampunk aesthetics. Certain moments go darker than the theme of the film intends to go such as the physical violence on children and murder of large groups of people. This shows the lengths the antagonist will go but puts on a very aggressive tone in the process which can overshadow the quirkiness that has been shown by all the characters throughout the entire film. The anti-war themes and theme of nature conservation are still here like most of Miyazaki's works, but it is not as blatant as is seen in Howl's Moving Castle or Princess Mononoke. A great film for newcomers to Studio Ghibli and for those who love diving into 80's fantasy adventure nostalgia.",

I liked the plot of this one but I'm rather ambivalent to the whole steampunk aesthetic in general so I wouldn't consider this one my favorite.

I had no idea that even before that, in their first movie, they created a pure fantasy story with visible 19th century inspirations, and one that plays nearly exactly like our western young adult novels no less. This is an epic tale that perfectly suits my personal tastes (perhaps because it lacks and distinctly Japanese elements that are so popular in anime), has beautiful structural integrity and is somehow able to present such a rich collection of scenes and characters despite being no longer than two hours. But two hours is still a lot for an animated movie and I feel grateful that here they are filled perfectly with a story that resonates with me and with stunning visuals. The movie is worth seeing even only for the few ethereal, melancholic moments that it spends on the exploration of the titular castle in the sky that beam witch such still beauty unlike nearly anything that I have ever seen on screen. For me this outclasses both \"Totoro\" and \"Spirited Away\" and I just can't wait to check out other Ghibli offerings. Who knows what treasures I am still to find among them?",

There's a lot of fun action sequences but also some quiet moments, which helps with the pacing a lot.\nSpeaking of pacing, the movie never feels too slow or too fast, its beautifully balanced.\nThe design and animation of the various technology used in the movie is excellent and creative. The backgrounds are beautiful and detailed, although they dont match newer Ghibli movies in detail. Laputa its self is designed perfectly.\nThe soundtrack of the movie is incredible. The music always fits each scene and the main theme is incredibly beautiful, almost unparalleled. Besides the flying castle with its robot soldiers, the Highlight of the movie is the releationship between the pirate captain and the two main characters Pazu and Sheeta combined with the excellent character development of the Pirate Captain, who almost becomes like a mother figure for the two.\n\nExcellent movie, deserving of a perfect score.",

            "content": "A breezy emotional odyssey!\n\nHayao Miyazaki's romantic fantasy adventure Castle in the Sky (1986) is pure magic on film. Studio Ghibli's hand drawn animation is second to none. Castle in the Sky's mystical tone, emotional magic, deep blues, bright skies, puffy clouds, and touching story all make it one of the finest anime films ever crafted. I'm grateful to be able to appreciate and enjoy Miyazaki's vast imagination to have created this genius narrative all from his mind with heartfelt themes of peace, love, and understanding. His passion shows in his direction with all manner of aircrafts, ruins, robots, and magic crystals like only a lover of fantasy and creativity could muster. You can see Miyazaki's influence in other anime with the girl falling from the sky to the flying castle and so much more innovative animation. I adored Castle in the Sky and look forward to cherishing it forever.\n\nAnna Paquin's voice acting in the English Dub is amazingly expressive for Sheeta. She delivers one of the greatest child voice acting recordings I've ever heard. She sounds heartbroken when the first robot dies and enthralled whenever she's speaking with her fellow adventurer boy Pazu. I found her accent adorable too coupled with her gentle tone. James Van Der Beek is immediately likable as Pazu with his endearing charm as the hard working boy, dreaming of flying to a castle in the sky to redeem his father's memory. He's really excellent and giving it his all with an excitable vocal performance.\n\nCloris Leachman's rambunctious elderly pirate leader Dola is a blast to hear and watch. Mark Hamill's evil role as the voice of Muska is fantastic. You feel his rage and hear his superior attitude towards all people below him. Uncle Pom's voice actor, Richard Dysart, did a wonderful job of making him sound gentle, yet knowledgeable. Jim Cummings does his usual booming voice for the greedy general. John Hostetter's grumpy voice is very pleasant for the old man boss. In short, Castle in the Sky has a phenomenally talented voice cast for the English Dub.\n\nHayao Miyazaki's direction is so focused and fun for this wild adventure full of an endearing little romance, goofy comedy with silly air pirates, hard commentary on military and federal greed, and general disgust at humanity's capabilities for arrogance in destroying nature for power. His writing is wonderfully inventive with a sci-fi penchant for airplanes and cybernetic cities. His people are grounded with a realism of hard labor with dreams of flying like we all have from time to time. I love how much Miyazaki treasures airships, gliders, automatons, and animals in his iconic anime films. Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky makes it easy to dream.\n\nHayao Miyazaki, Takeshi Seyama, Yoshihiro Kasahara's editing keeps Castle in the Sky moving at a frantic pace with chases quickly cut alongside massive explosions and swift aerial combat. It's 124 minutes of excitement, humor, romance, and mystery all in a briskly paced picture.\n\nSimilarly, Hirokata Takahashi's cinematography is expressive with large open wide shots of the sky to really ensure that it feels real and boundless. The way he shoots up close during certain fast flying sequences gives the feeling of their notable speed just like his wide shots allow the environment to feel real. All the background paintings for the vines, trees, and rubble look so vividly realized. Nizou Yamamoto and Toshio Nozaki's art direction is really spectacular for the floating castle, gritty warships, and mystical chambers with glowing crystals.\n\nJoe Hisaishi's airy score is composed with sweeping majesty and gentle fondness. His sweet score for Castle in the Sky is as lovely as the film itself with powerful symphonic strings and tender piano melodies all over his music. I really loved just sitting back hearing moving music that just allows you to be nostalgic for childhood. \n\nIf Miyazaki is good at anything, it's that his movies capture the sensation of childlike wonder when the city is first seen in a picture and then at the end for the finale. He grasps at the illusions of our dreams and wildest imagination, then transposes them on film. Castle in the Sky is wish fulfilment in the most satisfying way. All his mysteries are answered and the glow of the unknown is transformed into the breathtaking beauty of dreams being realized, friendships forming, and the loving warmth of romance evermore present in our heroes and in the audience alike.\n\nIn all, Castle in the Sky is immediately one of my absolute favorite Hayao Miyazaki feature films as well as a personal joy to watch. I hope you get to see it soon.",

This one may not be at the top of everyone's personal list of Ghibli films, but it is still an exceptional piece of filmmaking that only serves to solidify the studio's position as an all-time great in the medium.

Unfortunately Sheeta ends up being more of a plot device and less of a character - I think she might take one deliberate action the entire movie. The rest is just her being moved from place to place and everyone else doing things around her. It feels a bit misogynistic at times as traditional roles are forced upon her. The environmental allegories are pretty obvious but it's still a nice message. Since this is a classic Ghibli film I have to recommend it, but be sure to adjust your expectations for the time in which it was made.",

            "content": "I\u2019m all for movies that do their best to show and not tell, but my big frustration with Castle in the Sky is that it seems to have adopted the philosophy of show and then tell. The movie starts off and I felt like I was jumping in the middle of a story, almost like I turned on episode 5 of a television series without seeing the 4 that came before. I kept hoping it would slow down for even a few minutes so I could get to know any of the characters. But it was almost 30 minutes or more before they even took a moment to establish their identities, and even longer before I managed to care about them at all. I think it was when they started to work on the pirate ship that I finally found myself laughing with them and enjoying the film. Even then I didn\u2019t feel like the protagonists had much personality to them. It was almost like having two generic kids filling those main roles, and their only defining characteristics came from their situation rather than their personality traits. Then they hit the titular Castle in the Sky and everything stops. The exposition dump is excessive at this point of Castle in the Sky, and we aren\u2019t allowed to figure out anything for ourselves. This is the inevitable moment in the Miyazaki movie where he gets onto his soapbox about anti-war and environmentalism, which always takes me out of the movie, particularly when it feels like all story-telling halts in order to make the point. Once the plot gets moving again, I was on board for the action sequences, and I enjoyed watching the heroes fight back against the villain. The climax was a bit predictable since they so blatantly foreshadowed it, but the journey to that epic conclusion was thrilling. One final note, I am usually all about watching these anime films with the English dubbing, because I think they get solid actors and make it work brilliantly, but Anna Paquin and James Van Der Beek basically ruin this one. I kind of despised their performances, and would recommend you watch the subtitled version instead, even though that means missing great work from the likes of Mark Hamill and Cloris Leachman. My final assessment of Castle in the Sky is lukewarm. I didn\u2019t dislike it as much as most other Miyazaki films, but I wasn\u2019t all that enamored with it either.",

Moreover, the stories are not that strong to be my taste. So, I always avoid Japanese animes.\n\nI just said that I don't watch Japanese animes, it doesn't mean I don't see one. Some local TV channels in my country air Japanese animes and so, I sometimes see them and didn't like them because the stories are very bad.\n\nLaputa: The Castle in the Sky is the first Japanese anime I watched and also it's the only one I loved. When I saw this anime on a website, the reason why I decided was two main characters were kind of cute and lovely. So, I watched it and I loved it.\n\nThe story is not so simple and not so complicated. But because of the director, it turned out to be a good one. What I love about this anime is how Sheeta and the leader of those pirates became friends.\n\nI don't like the castle though. The castle is kind of ruined. Maybe it's because it is ruined in the story. So, the anime creators did like that. But it still works.\n\nThe anime was produced in 1986 (way before I was born) but the quality is unbelievably good. I haven't a clue before I saw it's production year. When I saw it, I can't believe it because the anime is too good.\n\nWhat I love most is the end credit song. That song is so cool.\n\nAll in all, for some people, the anime might be kind of inferior to those ones produced in 20th centuries but as for me, it's the best Japanese anime I've ever seen. It's totally worth spending time.",

She meets boy by the name of Pazu who plans to construct a plane and set off in search for the flying city of Laputa. During the movie we learn that in the past mankind mastered the technology which enabled construction of flying cities, but after an unnamed disaster survivors continued to live on the ground. The story of this anime is very easygoing and tender, but at the same time it opens up very serious issues concerning the relationship of man and civilization towards nature, while rethinking the essence of modern development and what is usually accepted as progress.\n\nIt's easy to notice similarity between the shape of the central tree that dominates Laputa, a symbol of prosperity, harmony and security, and the atomic mushroom created by the main weapon of this flying city. On the example of Laputa we can expose fundamental contradictions of imperialism / world system: Laputa is a paradise for those who live in it (in the centre of the world system), while at the same time it's bringing destruction to those who live on the ground (on the periphery of the world system). Equally important contradiction can be also seen in relation of the civilization towards the planet: while we are hypocritically promoting recycling and separating the glass, plastic and paper, at the same time corporations annually cut down between three and six billion trees, without any serious social resistance or critique.\n\nLaputa shows that harmful effects of technology are consequences of the choice of those who control the technology to use it in this way, or to simply ignore warnings and its harmful aspects. They appropriate benefits of technology for themselves, while transferring (externalizing) harm and problems to the rest of society. Miyazaki, the master of animation who grew up in postwar Japan, is careful not to opt for one of the sides in the false dilemma \"technology or nature\" and uses the metaphor of Laputa to construct a positive reference point against which we can critically observe our society.\n\nThe name Laputa comes from Swift's novel Gulliver's Travels, where exists a flying island of the same name whose residents use their technology for political domination. Political will for domination through technological superiority marked not only the twentieth century, but also of the previous millennia of civilization development. Laputa sends us the message that a sustainable civilization must renounce war as a way of life, and especially imperialism as inherently destructive social form. Laputa creates a longing in us to realise a balance between nature and technology - a society that will achieve symbiotic unity of the ecosphere and the technosphere.",

Full of adventure and wonder and all of the beautiful artistry you'd expect from auteur Hayao Miyazaki, Castle in the Sky is an absolutely wonderful and brilliant film that deserves all the praise its received. Miyazaki is one of the most talented storytellers in history when it comes to creating unique and complex worlds, and bringing the audience into them without confusion or disorientation. In Castle in the Sky we are dropped into the world of air pirates, a hidden floating city, and a mystical gem, and we never miss a beat. You are just excited to be on this adventure with these characters, and you can't wait to see what happens next. \n\nFrom the beautiful animation to the wonderful and complex performances from the 1998 voice cast, Castle in the Sky is one of the best adventure films of all time. With a Spielberg-esque approach to wonder and adventure, Miyazaki unfolds every moment of this story. You are along for the ride with Pazu and Sheeta as they search for Laputa, and you really begin to care about them as you go. You experience every moment of beauty and amazement with them, but you also feel the fear and excitement that comes with the real danger they experience.\n\nMiyazaki is so great at creating these big moments throughout the film that you can't help but feel like you're watching something more than animation. But he's also so perfect at creating the small character moments that you forget you're not watching real people on screen. All of these characters feel like flesh and blood people, and that is such an accomplishment for an animated feature. I hope that parents continue to bring their children into the world of Miyazaki films, because these beautiful adventures should be enjoyed throughout time.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nStudio Ghibli established itself in 1985 and produced their first film a year after; that film was Castle in the Sky. The film was a message to not only the audiences and competing animated studios of Japan, but to the whole world, that they are a force to be reckoned with. Many critics and fans by now have spoken out their adoration for this film, with some claiming it to be the best from both the studio and the director, Hayao Miyazaki. I felt it comes off a bit short in being perfect, but it possesses such a large amount of positive qualities, that I couldn't help but fall in love with it.\n\nThe film's plot is not as complicated as I thought it would be, it actually is quite simple to follow and the film doesn't spend too much time in explaining itself to its audience. Miyazaki, who also wrote the screenplay for this film, sees his audience as capable beings that are able to think for themselves, and not needing someone to spoon-feed them in order for them to be satisfied. He has so much faith in his own work that it allows the film to come off as layered and internally complex. The themes and subject of the film brings in ideas that were prominent during this time in cinema, artificial intelligence and extra-terrestrials, the latter being delivered in a more metaphorical form. It was clear to me that Miyazaki was influenced by Close Encounters of the Third Kind as many of the film's scenes and ideas feel similar, just written and directed at a more ambiguous way. It never felt like he was completely ripping off Spielberg's ideas as the events that unfold don't happen with similar precision, it comes off more like a respective homage. Environmentalism has been a common theme in Studio Ghibli films, and this film promotes it beautifully as it doesn't shove it down the audience's throat; for it to be apparent, it is required by the viewers to look beyond the film's basic narrative and search for the film's heart. Also, was I the only one who picked up a feeling of Star Wars in the film's characters, particularly the core antagonist Muska, who comes off like a Darth Vader figure; maybe this was just me.\n\nCastle in the Sky is arguably Studio Ghibli's and Miyazaki's most adventurous and expansive film. The feeling of intimacy is very minimal here and is usually only found in minor character developmental moments with the two leading protagonists. The sense of romance is certainly there but it doesn't reach to a point where it takes over the tone and atmosphere of the film. The film remains on point with its fascination and adventure towards Laputa. Throughout the film, a sense of magic and wonderment fills the story and its characters, which is a quality that is expected from a Miyazaki film. Castle in the Sky remains appealing to an extensive range of audiences as everybody can enjoy an adventure film as it allows us to escape from the simplicity and dullness of life, while at the same time this film features themes and characters that people can easily be fascinated with. I see a lot of myself in Pazu, fascinated by the unknown and determined to find answers. My fascination is driven with selfish intent as I have no agenda to gain a sense of financial profit or political control, I simply just want to know and understand.\n\nMy issue with this film lies on the slight drop in quality during the middle section of the film, particularly when the two characters are on the pirate ship. These scenes felt too stagnant and lacking in effectiveness in its attempt of creating a tender atmosphere between the two leading characters. When you compare it to the first and final act of the film, it lacks the emotional impact or intensity that bookends were able to offer. The first act of the film delivers humorous and entertaining sequences that keeps their audiences engages, while also providing small moments of character development. The final act of the film delivers a sense of intensity and threat that lets the lives of the characters feel on the line.

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nStudio Ghibli established itself in 1985 and produced their first film a year after; that film was Castle in the Sky. The film was a message to not only the audiences and competing animated studios of Japan, but to the whole world, that they are a force to be reckoned with. Many critics and fans by now have spoken out their adoration for this film, with some claiming it to be the best from both the studio and the director, Hayao Miyazaki. I felt it comes off a bit short in being perfect, but it possesses such a large amount of positive qualities, that I couldn't help but fall in love with it.\n\nThe film's plot is not as complicated as I thought it would be, it actually is quite simple to follow and the film doesn't spend too much time in explaining itself to its audience. Miyazaki, who also wrote the screenplay for this film, sees his audience as capable beings that are able to think for themselves, and not needing someone to spoon-feed them in order for them to be satisfied. He has so much faith in his own work that it allows the film to come off as layered and internally complex. The themes and subject of the film brings in ideas that were prominent during this time in cinema, artificial intelligence and extra-terrestrials, the latter being delivered in a more metaphorical form. It was clear to me that Miyazaki was influenced by Close Encounters of the Third Kind as many of the film's scenes and ideas feel similar, just written and directed at a more ambiguous way. It never felt like he was completely ripping off Spielberg's ideas as the events that unfold don't happen with similar precision, it comes off more like a respective homage. Environmentalism has been a common theme in Studio Ghibli films, and this film promotes it beautifully as it doesn't shove it down the audience's throat; for it to be apparent, it is required by the viewers to look beyond the film's basic narrative and search for the film's heart. Also, was I the only one who picked up a feeling of Star Wars in the film's characters, particularly the core antagonist Muska, who comes off like a Darth Vader figure; maybe this was just me.\n\nCastle in the Sky is arguably Studio Ghibli's and Miyazaki's most adventurous and expansive film. The feeling of intimacy is very minimal here and is usually only found in minor character developmental moments with the two leading protagonists. The sense of romance is certainly there but it doesn't reach to a point where it takes over the tone and atmosphere of the film. The film remains on point with its fascination and adventure towards Laputa. Throughout the film, a sense of magic and wonderment fills the story and its characters, which is a quality that is expected from a Miyazaki film. Castle in the Sky remains appealing to an extensive range of audiences as everybody can enjoy an adventure film as it allows us to escape from the simplicity and dullness of life, while at the same time this film features themes and characters that people can easily be fascinated with. I see a lot of myself in Pazu, fascinated by the unknown and determined to find answers. My fascination is driven with selfish intent as I have no agenda to gain a sense of financial profit or political control, I simply just want to know and understand.\n\nMy issue with this film lies on the slight drop in quality during the middle section of the film, particularly when the two characters are on the pirate ship. These scenes felt too stagnant and lacking in effectiveness in its attempt of creating a tender atmosphere between the two leading characters. When you compare it to the first and final act of the film, it lacks the emotional impact or intensity that bookends were able to offer. The first act of the film delivers humorous and entertaining sequences that keeps their audiences engages, while also providing small moments of character development. The final act of the film delivers a sense of intensity and threat that lets the lives of the characters feel on the line. If the middle section of the film had that certain quality that made it stand out then I would have adored the hell out of this film and give it a perfect score.\n\nI was truly impressed with the film's visuals, particularly since this film was animated in the 80s, featuring exhilarating action sequences and breathtaking backdrops that could easily have someone completely lose them into the world and story.

The movie is about getting to the epic floating city Laputa, which is the home of a ancient race that had technology far superior to anyone. Its almost like Atlantis, which had advance technology, far superior to anything during its time. The movie shows how power can make people go crazy.

Not to mention the steampunk design is probably the most impressively executed from the studio to this very date, the Laputan robots alone standing as one of the greatest character designs in the Ghibli arsenal, easily.

It matches many of Miyazaki's constantly recurring themes, giving another look at how humanity plays a role in the progression of nature and ecology.\r\n\r\nCastle in the Sky falls somewhere in the middle of Miyazaki's varying maturity levels.  While certainly not a children's movie specifically, it isn't too frightening for the young ones, with great scenes of peril being the most shocking imagery.  It's on par with most present-day American family films in this respect.  Additionally it sports a more standard plot structure than most Studio Ghibli productions, with relatively familiar characters and goals.  Nonetheless, there is still a level of imagination here which seems to escape Hollywood animators, or rather I should say Hollywood writers.  Not to say that American writers are less talented, only that they are constrained by a modern studio system which demands a more formulaic approach.\r\n\r\nThis may be why Castle in the Sky didn't appeal to me as much as other Miyazaki projects.  It doesn't carry the same sweeping imagination which entices you into its world.  In fact for much of the first hour I found myself daydreaming and losing interest in much of the action.  The scenery is worthy of as much praise as other action greats like Nausicaa and Mononoke, but it isn't nearly as viscerally involving.\r\n\r\nWhat may be most praiseworthy about this film is the reveal of the actual castle in question, and the secrets that lie therein.  I won't divulge the details, but I feel like it was brilliantly executed and the stark contrast of areas within the mythical Laputa plays perfectly into Miyazaki's vision of man vs. nature.  Beauty alongside incredible technology and an ancient people who hoped to find harmony between the two, while nearly ruling the world in the process.  This is a world only Miyazaki could create, and it's definitely a fun one in which to escape.\r\n\r\nAnother female protagonist walks this world.  Like many others, she is somewhat clueless about her place in the world and is simply trying to accomplish an epic goal while never cutting corners by hurting others.  This character type which Miyazaki loves to use is one of the most inspirational parts of his filmmaking, serving as a wonderful role model for young audiences.  The male character in this film is also a pure hero, who gives his full devotion to friends as well as adventure.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Castle in the Sky is a really good film which sadly doesn't have the intoxicating fantasy of some of Studio Ghibli's great productions.  All that aside, it is still a better option than 90% of the CGI slapstick bug-eyed creature films which occupy our silver screens most of the time.",

I started watching Castle in the Sky with the most modest of expectations. I wasn't expecting greatness, but I was also excited to see Miyazaki's take on a swashbuckling story. In the end, I was mostly satisfied. The problems with pacing and narrative continue to force me to marvel at why Miyazaki is esteemed so highly. And yet, the movie does have a host of fun parts while lacking some of the filmmaker's usual pretentiousness. While by no means great, Castle in the Sky does slide in nicely between Howl's Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke as my second favorite Miyazaki movie.\r\n\r\nA young girl named Sheeta posses a beautiful crystal. Said crystal has immense power, so obviously, bad people want it for themselves. Sheeta winds up in the care of young Pazu. He has a dream of one day seeing the floating city of Laputa. Oddly enough, Sheeta's crystal has the ability to make her float as well. So with sky pirates and crooked government agents hot on their trail, Pazu and Sheeta set out to reach Laputa.\r\n\r\nThe most glaring issue with Castle in the Sky revolves around its story. Number one, the movie is far too long at 125 minutes. It's disappointing to say, but this movie is actually pretty boring at times. The pacing is off, making parts of the movie very dull. Even the \"grand finale\" was plodding. Which leads to number two, the movie's payoff is extremely weak. The first two acts of the movie definitely had me intrigued to see the floating city. And since the movie is so lengthy, there's this long (and sometimes tedious) buildup to the third act. But then once the movie finally arrives at the floating city, it honestly has nothing to say. It's probably trying to say something really deep about saving the trees and whatnot, but the execution is massively disappointing. And the ending itself is just atrocious. The movie has no idea what to do with itself when it comes to wrapping everything up. So instead of providing real closure, the movie just flails off the the side a little bit, then ends. Not what you would expect from a \"master filmmaker.\"\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Castle in the Sky definitely has the most wasted potential of any Miyazaki movie I've seen. In a story with sky pirates, massive hand cannons, steampunk flying ships, and a floating city (!), we don't even get an entirely entertaining two hours!? All the pieces of a great movie are in place. I have no complaints about the story, characters, action, universe, and so forth. But most of that is squandered with poor pacing and the lame third act ... and all the fault rest in the director/screenwriter. In all fairness, this was only Miyazaki's 2nd full movie. But then again, he makes the exact same mistakes almost twenty years later in Howl's Moving Castle. \r\n\r\nAt least this movie does have the pieces of a great film. The story is the most \"swashbuckling\" idea I've seen from Miyazaki. The supporting characters are very distinctive. The action is pretty amazing when it does show up. Miyazaki's eye for visuals is still fully intact. He creates yet another splendid world! I do love the steampunk elements, and I'm always happy to see airborne pirates!\r\n\r\nThe cast does an adequate job. James Van Der Beek plays Pazu just as he should be played. I was very disappointed that both Pazu and Sheeta were completely void of character development. For that matter, there really isn't any meaningful development for any of the characters. Anna Paquin plays Sheeta. For the entire movie, I was trying to place her voice. She's got that very singular way of talking. At any rate, she is just fine as Sheeta, considering how unoriginal the character is. And speaking of which, with the exception of Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki continues to create really uninspired main characters. Both the character, and character design of Pazu and Sheeta remains wholly bland. They are the standard movie hero and heroine. Nothing sets them apart.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast does well enough. Cloris Leachman is the most interesting as Dola, the pirate captain. The entire pirate crew is probably the most interesting bunch of supporting characters Miyazaki has ever dreamed up. Mark Hamill plays the villain, Colonel Muska. After achieving commercial success in Star Wars, Hamill won critical acclaim for his vocal performance as The Joker in Batman the Animated Series. Here, he doesn't stand out in any way. If I didn't see his name in the credits, I would have never thought it was Hamill. \r\n\r\nAt the risk of sounding like a broken record, I must reaffirm that Joe Hisaishi does, in fact, provide yet another A+ musical score! When watching a Miyazaki movie, I can count on two things as surefire hits: the animation and visuals will be stunning, and Hisaishi will provide a splendid score. And so he does! It isn't quite as memorable as his other work (that I've heard), but it still does its job, and does it extremely well. \r\n\r\nCastle in the Sky is at both times the most frustrating, and the second best Miyazaki movie I've seen. If he had capitalized on all the potential in this film, it probably would have been better than Princess Mononoke. But through poor screenwriting, Castle in the Sky is knocked down to \"only slightly better than Howl's Moving Castle\" status. If there's one overarching flaw I've found in all Miyazaki movies, its that he simply cannot write a satisfying third act. Believe it or not, Spirited Away is the only example where the third act is better than what came before it. So at the end of the day, given its potential for greatness, Castle in the Sky is a solid movie that ultimately feels like a glaring waste of great ideas. \r\n\r\n\"A king without compassion does not deserve a kingdom.\" 7/10",

Written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki which the time is during the late 1900's or somewhere along there, and a group of pirates on flying pods with huge insect wings are sabotaging a huge state-of-the-art airplane blimp that looks very futuristically advanced.   Anyways, the guy keeping her held up is also bad otherwise, Sheeta would not have knocked him out with a vase and everyone seems to be after her.  So she steps out of the blimp and falls making her faint but the pendent she's wearing around her neck saves her by floating her down very gently- similar to what a balloon would do.  The boy Pazu is there and catches her and doesn't know what to make of it. We, the viewers are also curious about it's movie's title \"Castle In the Sky\" and what does she as well as her pendent have to do with it, and it regards some mythical legend regarding a castle that's been seen floating around but has never been discovered.  Is this legend just a hoax or is it really a reality which regards Sheeta's past.   For the movie explains how it may be  possible for anything to float in the first place and it has a lot to do with the pendant she is wearing.\r\n\r\nI thought Anna Paquin did an awesome job with Sheeta but I can't say the same for James Van der Beek voicing for Pazu. Aforementioned, I'm not accustomed to director Miyazaki including very evil characters since I really believe that a leopard can't change his spots and he sort of depends on fate to take care of itself when it would've been better if he doesn't even include any evil characters at all.              \r\n\r\n3 out of 4 stars",

Treading a fine line between his epic adventures (Nausicca, Howl's Moving Castle) and his gentler dramas (like my personal favorite My Neighbor Totoro), Hayao Miyazaki crafts an influential tale that is heartwarming, thrilling, and thoughtful often all at the same time.

I enjoyed the first hour immensely, but I would have enjoyed seeing a bit more of the titular castle and its awe-inspiring visuals.

While I was watching the film, I felt like I was watching a film that I generally had only seen for the first time, which not also brought a nostalgia mindset, but had also decided to try the best it could to keep it, and you know what, it did it well, it did it very well.\n\nThe plot goes as we see a girl named Sheeta being captured by the \"evil government\" so to speak for helping them find a mysterious floating island known as Laputa, and then its being intervened by a group of pirates who are there to take her \"amulet\" an object that has mystical powers that grants access to the floating island which is said to have hidden treasures.

And the story to the film is brilliant.\n\nWhy didn't it get 5 stars?\nWell, I have to say that there only two problems with the movie, first off is the English dub, its not that voices actors do a terrible job, but they chose adults for the dubbing of this movie, and its not half bad its just not great though. Its not the writing, well some of it, but that's not the focus, its the differences between the Japanese version and the Disney version.\n\nWhen this film was released, it was released in 2003 in America, and that's a long time before America ever got to see this film strike rich here. And did it strike rich here? Not quite, it would be a while before Ghibli ever got to have their films sent to the US for dubbing, and well, will get to that later. But that's still not the problem.\n\nThe problem is is the fact that they changed a few things from the original Japanese version, for instance, one of the things that they did was that they added music into the quiet moments, because apparently for whatever stupid reason it was, Disney thought that kids would get bored if nothing was going on. That's one problem.\n\nThe second problem is the villain, who is a little weak and very forgettable name-wise, I mean I even remember having to go on a wiki article just to find out who the bad guy is, and yeah, when you do that, and you forget, it can be a little distracting. In fact, I watched the English dub just for the heck of it, and the only thing that I could remember about the villain was that it was voiced by Mark Hamill, that was it. I didn't know why or how, but that's all I could think of. Is there much change in the Japanese version? Aside from the voice actor, surprisingly, no, its not that the villain is a bad villain he's just not particularly memorable, I mean he does something, but, he's just not the best I've seen. But other than that, that's the only other problems I had. There were a few minor problems with the side characters, for example there is one character that is just in one scene and gone for the rest of the movie, and I ask the question, where did he come from? What's his background, what's his story? I don't know, and it kills me that I can't figure it out. But other than that, that's the only problems.\n\nIs the movie good? Heck yes! Should you watch the Disney version? Heck no. In fact, I'd rather you just stick with the original source which is the Japanese version. But that's just me though, I can't stop you from watching the Disney version even if I wanted to. What would I give the Disney dub, well aside from the differences with music, sound effects, the voice acting, probably a 4 * out of 5. And even with that score its still a great film, I just would like to see the film re-dubbed if it were possible and kept in its original form.\n\nBut with the Japanese version, on the other hand, the characters, the memorable music, the animation, the writing, the ingenuity of it all.

            "content": "After the huge success of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, it's writer and director, Hayao Miyazaki, would go on to establish the now famous Studio Ghibli with fellow animator Isao Takahata in 1985. One year after it's establishment, Miyazaki would direct the first movie officially released under the Studio Ghibli name, known as Laputa: Castle in the Sky (simply renamed Castle in the Sky in later releases). Also written by Miyazaki, Castle in the Sky is a wonderfully made movie, filled to the brim with fun action scenes and hilarious jokes. \r\n\r\nAccording to Castle in the Sky's backstory, human civilization built huge cities floating above the clouds before a catastrophe destroyed all but one city, Laputa. Viewed mostly as a legend by civilization down on the ground, nobody is quite sure if it is real or a hoax. One such person is Pazu, a young boy whose father had searched for Laputa himself. One day, Pazu is heading to work when he discovers a strange blue light falling slowly from the sky. Upon investigating, Pazu finds the most unexpected of things: a young girl.\r\n\r\nPazu soon discovers that the girl's name is Sheeta, and she has apparent ties to Laputa, which Pazu has his own fascination with. As the two grow closer as friends, a man by the name of Muska and a group of air-pirates, led by a woman named Dola, both of whom were chasing Sheeta in the film's opening sequence, resume their chase for Sheeta, more specifically the necklace she wears around her neck. As Pazu and Sheeta attempt to escape these two groups, they are sucked into a grand adventure that unleashes the secrets of Laputa itself. \r\n\r\nMiyazaki's tale in Castle in the Sky is a very whimsical adventure full of adventure and excitement. Like his previous movie, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Miyazaki includes themes of environmentalism and war, but they aren't nearly as obvious as they were in Nausicaa. The real strength of Castle in the Sky, however, is the dialogue itself. The screenplay has a good mix of seriousness and humor that works extremely well throughout the entire movie. Although the pacing seems inconsistent, the story and dialogue itself is superb. \r\n\r\nThe voice talent is good overall. James Van Der Meek is a delightful voice for Pazu, although he may seem to old for the character. Anna Paquin voices Sheeta, who is just ok overall. She almost seems to jump\r\nback and forth between an attempted American accent and her native Canadian accent, which can seem a bit obnoxious at times. The two actors create amazing chemistry between their two characters though, which is absolutely charming. Also in the cast is Cloris Leachman as a great Dola, and Mark Hamill as Muska, who arguably steals the show with his amazing performance as the primary antagonist.\r\n\r\nAs Studio Ghibli's first feature film, Castle in the Sky is a huge success. Miyazaki's original story is action packed and humorous, allowing it to be enjoyed by viewers of all ages. The voice talent is solid, particularly Mark Hamill's menacing villain, and the animation is beautiful. The movie may have flaws within its pacing and certain elements of its voice cast, but overall, Castle in the Sky is a solid Miyazaki movie. With two fantastic movies under his belt, Hayao Miyazaki started his career with a bang, and Castle in the Sky was just the beginning.",

She finds safety with another orphan, Pazu. He lives in a mining town full of very humble and helpful neighbors. Pazu and Sheeta become friends immediately. Pazu helps her get away from the wannabe kidnappers.\n\nSheeta has a mysterious necklace that seems to assist her whenever she's in dangerous situations. Pazu's father had a fascination with trying to discover the floating city of Laputa. Sheeta learns of her heritage later on and discovers she is a princess of Laputa. After many struggles and a great adventure the two orphans find their way to the floating city. Laputa is a magnificent city. It has a great tree at the center with roots running deep. It was also a city of advanced technology. Laputa was an interesting combination of nature and science. \n\nThe music was so wonderful while soaking in the scenery. Castle in the Sky is yet another beautiful movie by Hayao Miyazaki. The focus for this movie is more around friendship versus family. For me, it really described how friends can become our family.  The pirates seem like the bad guys at the beginning of the movie but they soon become allies. The \"captain\" and mother of the many boys is a very strong female character. All of her sons are very goofy yet obidient. The fathers appearance reminded me of Doctor Eggman from Sonic the Hedgehog. This movie isn't as carefree as My Neighbor Totoro or Kiki's Delivery Service. The story is still amazing as well as the visual effects and music. It's still safe for children to watch but definitely a little bit more serious as far as the plot is concerned. I absolutely loved the robots!",

The American voice acting fits very well into the Dubbed version and the overall atmosphere is just so loveable.

            "content": "Laputa is the second film ever made by Studio Ghibli and is one of the most magical adventures they've ever created. It's a beautiful animated film that pleases both adults and children. For a film made in 1986, the quality of animation throughout is extraordinary. While it isn't flawless, it is still one of the very best creations from the masterful mind of Hayao Miyazaki.\n\nEverything in the film revolves around a floating castle in the sky named Laputa. The main character is Shita (Anna Paquin), a little girl who possesses an ominous crystal with the power to make her float to safety. After she escapes being captured by a strange man who seeks the crystal, she floats down safely into the arms of a young man named Patsu (James Van Der Beek). Together, they run from pirates, the army, and all sorts of strange people. Only one thing is certain: they are all seeking the path to Laputa and whatever secrets and treasures lies within.\n\nOne thing that instantly stands out in this film is the magnificent score by Joe Hisaishi. He has made some marvellous music for Studio Ghibli. Laputa stands up there as one of his very best. It sets the tone of the film and really brings emotion into the story. The animation is also breathtaking, considering the time the film was made. It may not stand up to the standards of today's animation, but its beauty is still something to behold.\n\nCloris Leachman was the standout among the voice actors. She was fantastic as 'Dola', the leader of the pirates. There are many amazing characters throughout the Studio Ghibli movies, and she would be up there with the best. Anna Paquin's New Zealander accent was exotic and certainly set the film apart from most. I don't mean to offend anyone from NZ, but after prolonged exposure to her voice I became irritated. I had the same feelings towards the voice actor of Patsu, who grained on my patience too.\n\nI loved the movie to bits. It truly set a benchmark for animated films back in its day. My small synopsis did not do the story justice, for it really is a remarkable tale. The music, animation, and story combine to create one of the greatest animated movies of all time. Although it isn't the best of Hayao Miyazaki (That honor would fall to either Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle or Princess Mononoke), it is still one of the best animated movies of all time.",
