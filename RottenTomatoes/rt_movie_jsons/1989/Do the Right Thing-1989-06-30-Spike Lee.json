A neighborhood local, Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito), becomes upset when he sees that the pizzeria's Wall of Fame exhibits only Italian actors.

            "content": "Do the Right Thing? \n\n\tIf we're looking into films that cinematically capture a picture and message through so many different roles, Do the Right Thing is dead to rights in that category. Spike Lee directs a pretty funny film with so much meaning behind it, while writing, producing, and starring in it as the one of the main characters Mookie. The movie's also produced by Monty Ross and contains a sufficient amount of well known actors and actresses such as Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee. Do the Right Thing is set on the hottest day of the year in Brooklyn, New York. To say the least, the movie is about a community that faces a bunch of different emotions in general, but especially on this given day. Before we get into it, some of the key devices I saw Lee use: constant sweat on each character, everyone using fans and always looking exhausted, mentally and physically, as well as the heat waves used to portray the drastic temperatures. Danny Aiello plays an Italian American restaurant owner who's not too fond of the African American folk in the community. At one point in the film, Aiello gets so angry and fed up with one of the characters, Radio Raheem, and how he plays his music so loud that he smashes his big boom box with a baseball bat. From watching the film and the crash course on it, the movie highlights so many different social aspects. Racism is identified with all the different interactions between the various ethnicities within the community. We see that the African Americans don't get along very well with the smaller group of Mexicans. The Italian Americans aren't too fond of the African Americans for instances like the fire hydrant scene when one of the actors drives by and asks not to get sprayed, but that scene ends up with him getting soaked and his car damper than ever. The boom box is also always rocking with \"Fight the Power\" the song that Rosie Perez (her being another favorite part about the movie for me) dances to in the beginning of the film, starting off hot, making us expect an upbeat tone to the movie. \n\n\t8.5/10. Despite all the interactions between the ethnicities of the community, Spike Lee does a great job of taking race and racism and making a fun film. Something we can all relate to at some point and be able to shed light in the end. For me, this was my first time seeing the movie, and the ending had me wonder what Spike Lee was trying to convey. But my overall outlook is that in that moment, Lee had little faith in America's state of racism. I believe he hasn't seen the change he desires just yet.",

The film is set in a predominantly African-American/Latino neighborhood on a hot summer day.  What starts as a mere disagreement between the owner of a popular local pizza parlor (Danny Aiello), who is Italian-American and one of the neighborhood residents who is African-American eventually descends into violence later in the day as underlying racial tensions are revealed in the film.  The opening is powerful as it depicts Rosie Perez dancing to a hip hop song.  As the song becomes more intense, so does Rosie's dancing.   The way the Dutch Angle is used frequently in the film to convey both the emotion and theme is a powerful tool to bring Lee's message across to the audience.  Lee makes it a point to show the undercurrent of racism that escalates into the eventual violent incident, which still permeates our society.  It is a very well done film, though classifying it as a comedy is a stretch as I found the comedic contact fairly lacking.  I do recommend this movie for seeing and hearing a message that needs to be told.",

            "content": "The Controversial Battle \nDo The Right Thing was made in 1989, and was produced, written and directed by Spike Lee. Starring Spike Lee as Mookie, Danny Aiello as Sal and Rosie Perez as Tina, this film discussed controversial topics that caused the film to be seen in a number of ways by many people. The movie discusses race in ways that most movies won't touch and in a way I think it's important. Many movies of these times if they discuss race do it in a more topical way and don't divulge into the real problems that so many people are facing then and today. Many try to avoid the topic altogether just by saying that the film is confusing or inappropriate. This movie has a strong sense of diversity with an all black neighborhood and a pizza place and a Korean fruit market, there still lies a strong sense of community between everyone. With such racial violence, this movie became a shock to some. It is definitely a movie that has many different views for many different people to take time and think if it's something that they agree with. This film discusses a lot of racial issues that are present especially in Brooklyn, New York. \nThis confrontation to racism is not something that is done in many modern day films in production today because of the strong and controversial take that is present. This film looks at all the decisions that are made and how they affect their lives after and what could have been done differently. Aside from the small sense of comedy that this film had, it covered a strong and serious storyline that ultimately was what made this film what it is still today. \nOne interesting thing about the filming of this movie was that it was completely filmed on Stuyvesant Avenue between Quincy St. and Lexington Ave in a neighborhood in Brooklyn. The colors in this movie were a great part of how it stuck out against other films being made in this time. A lot of red and orange colors were used in order to create a sense of heat.",

            "content": "Do the Right Thing is a 1989 comedy-drama film that was produced, written, and directed by Spike Lee who had taken inspiration from what became known as the Howard Beach Incident. The movie had a host of big-name actors including Samuel L Jackson, Danny Aiello, Spike Lee, Frankie Falson, and John Turturro. This film highlighted the racial tensions across the United States between different groups (Italian Americans and African Americans in this film) and showed how a simple situation sparked so quickly into violence and tragedy. Sal's Pizza had been in business for 25 years and had built a relationship with the community which supported it.  You could see people's behaviors change throughout the movie in relation to the individuals who liked or hated it. \nI felt this movie and Napoleon Dynamite both created more social awareness through what could be seen as a controversial lens by bringing the issues of the times to the forefront with no apologies. Both used very stereotypical types of characters to accentuate cultural norms, and widely held beliefs, such as Mookie with his baby-mana and not having much to do with his son. While Napoleon was more well received, Do the Right Thing sparked a match in critics who felt it promoted violence as a means to feel liberated. Because this movie had such a tragic event and led to a confrontation between Mookie and Sal in which they go through a large range of emotions and finally come to an understanding it let people think of whether it was intended that people interpret Mookie's actions as helping Sal or if he just put gas on the fire. One of the most symbolic parts of the movie is the music, such as Raheem with his boombox playing Fight the Power and Can't Stand It which were metaphorical manifestations of the anger and frustration people felt.  You also had interpretive dancing in the opening of the movie to display the highs and lows of the culture. \nThese events and racial tension would later lead to the LA riots and Reginald Denny's tragic and unfortunate timing.  Even today this film still has power behind it showing people that it's more of a kingdom of conscience that will help undo all the hostility rather than hostility.",

            "content": "What is truly the right thing to do\n\nDo the right thing was written, directed, and produced by Spike Lee. The movie was an instant classic in the comedy world, starring Giancarlo Esposito. The film was released in 1989 and made a large sum of 37.3 million dollars at the box office. \nThe film takes place on a hot summer day and features various prominent personalities. The movie opens with Mookie, who is a pizza delivery man. The son of the owner of the pizza shop Mookie works for is Giuseppe, who is an outward racist and has no issue with spouting out the n-word whenever he pleases. The movie deals a lot with racial issues that were very prevalent at the time. All types of racist remarks are made in all directions, like the Asian community, the black community, the Italians, and the whites. The racism is in your face, forcing you to make your opinions about it. The movie's tension rises when Radio Raheem is killed my a policeman who puts him in a chokehold. This leads to a small group forming outside of Sal's restaurant, and after Mookie takes a trash can and throws it through the window, a riot ensues. The mob ends up burning down the restaurant, and I think this is symbolic of the people trying to rid racism from their community in a flawed attempt. \nDo the Right Thing is a comedically sound movie that deals with a lot of racial tension under the guise of comedy, allowing people to have these hard conversations about race more easily. I think it relates to Napoleon Dynamite because of the race factor. Even way out in the middle of nowhere, like in Napoleon Dynamite, we have characters like Pedro and lafawnduh, who have very stereotypical names. It shows how diverse the country is and opens your eyes to racism in all forms. The dutch angles used in Do the Right Thing show when a character's reality is becoming unbalanced and how the tension in the scene is rising. These different camera angles are showcased throughout the film, bringing on different emotional responses. I would recommend this film to those who are interested in deeper topics like race.",

Taking place in his home town of Brooklyn, NY, Lee brought us into a time where racism was at its peak. Characters like Sal played by Danny Aiello brought a perspective that left viewers understanding how the actions of one person could cause a riot among a community. Spike Lee was brilliant in his filmmaking technique, using only warm colors, heat lamps, and spray bottles to illustrate the heat wave in the city, easily transferring that heat to the characters temperament. Lee was also able to use wide tracking shots, and canted angles to get minor characters into scenes, redirecting scenes, and giving the audience the feeling that the world was tilted. His brilliance in this helped to bring emotion to the audience, and keep them watching. This politically driven film was Lee's way of trying to get people to talk about the issues of racism, which did just that. I would compare this movie cinematically with \"Napoleon Dynamite\" in that it used angles that were not normal to commercialized movies but had the power of Charlie Chaplin's \"The Great Dictator\" by bringing attention to real world issues that have been unjust for decades. Lee did a great job with this film playing to both culture identities and helping all to see from a different angle.",

            "content": "Don't follow the group to do evil——Appreciation of Do the Right Thing\nDo the Right Thing is a film directed by the famous director Spike Lee that reflects racial discrimination. The story happened on the hottest day of the year in New York, because the black young people were dissatisfied that there were no black celebrities hanging in the pizza shop and the shop owner drove them out of the shop. Later, the shop owner broke a radio in a rage during the quarrel with the black youth, which led to another black youth fighting with him. Finally, the police came to stop the fight between the two and killed the black youth by mistake. Angry blacks believed that they had suffered racial discrimination and burned down the pizza shop jointly run by the owner and his son.\nDifferent from the soft colors of Napoleon Dynamite, the color of this film is strong. Spike Lee uses almost all the warm colors, such as red, orange and yellow, which represent the sun, fire and earth. Each character is sweating and wet clothes are stuck on them. The high temperature warning not only represents the high temperature heat wave, but also symbolizes the angry relationship between people, and the tense ethnic relationship, which is the preparation for the final violence. The often-inclined photography angle in the dialogue shows the inner impetuosity of the characters. In the climax of the film, Spike Lee suddenly cuts into a series of scenes that break the four walls. He makes each character angrily say racist lines to the camera, and the camera quickly pushes in front of each standing character. This strong tension can quickly replace the audience into the film. In the era when the story happened, the black group was also widely discriminated against, but Spike Lee's purpose in shooting this film was to achieve a higher level: when unfair treatment was rampant, if people only use violence to communicate and vent, the racial problem could not be rooted out, and everything would only go round and round. Moreover, the purpose of our anti-discrimination cannot be to enjoy the privilege, just like the black people in the film who fight against racial discrimination while discriminating against the Asian family in the street.\nIn a word, the old man whom everyone looked down upon in the film kept the last bottom line of human nature. I hope everyone can understand the meaning of \"Do the Right Thing\".",

            "content": "Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing embodies everything great about film. On a technical aspect, its use of color, cameras, music, and set pieces are just fantastic. The premise is simple – on the hottest day of the year in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, tensions run high between different racial groups. Though the neighborhood is predominantly African American, we see many other marginalized groups: Korean, Latino, Italian - one character is even mentally impaired. There is so much turmoil threatening to boil over, so much hatred targeted towards each other based on assumptions and stereotypes. Ultimately, the heat and proximity, as well as the looming gentrification of the neighborhood come to a tipping point and chaos ensues.\n\tThis film has a little bit of everything going beyond just comedy to make a real social statement. Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic in the role of Senor Love Daddy who watches it all unfold with the audience. The rest of the cast is equally enthralling in their roles, with perhaps Lee's portrayal of Mookie being the least enticing performance of them all. The colorful cast embody real life characters that contribute to the charm of NYC neighborhoods, but the film is unafraid to explore their ugliness that often rears its head.\n\tLee was ambitious to make a film with such a strong message that many of the day perceived as controversial. Nowadays, depicting violence in film and media is not as controversial as it once was, but given current issues in the United States many might be quick to make the same claims that his film would encourage violence and riots. I believe people making these accusations either don't fully understand the film themselves, or they don't trust other people to understand the true message. Ultimately, it is a brief dive into how ugly we can be towards each other, in often pointless and fruitless ways. The frustration Lee feels as a black man should be explored so audiences may gain understanding and empathy, not shut down and censored because it makes those who don't face the same issues uncomfortable or afraid. To be able to pretend these issues don't exist or matter is a privilege that many cannot afford – mediums like film can help bridge the gaps between our experiences and create understanding with one another and highlight the issues that still plague our society, even thirty years later. I undoubtedly think this is one of the best films ever made and consider it a must-see for all.",

            "content": "Spike Lee's Depressing Melting Pot\n\nIn this highly politicized film, Spike Lee explores racial tensions using various cinematic devices to engage the audience and appeal to their emotions. This film, which was released in 1989 by Spike Lee, has more than a personal touch since the setting, Brooklyn NY, matches Spike Lee's hometown. This film follows a pizza delivery boy Mookie (Spike Lee) who delivers for Sal (Danny Aiello), a famous pizza joint in Brooklyn. The entire movie spans a record-breaking hot day that reflects the mood of the community. The audience interacts with characters through the Mookie and interacts with a multi-ethnic community which has the feel of a ticking time bomb. It eventually does set off with a killing of a young African American man and the rioting of Sal's pizza. The unsettling feel of the movie lends itself to a certain crowd and does not shy away from engaging racial tensions that were being felt at the time. In comparison to other comedic films like \"Napoleon Dynamite\" and \"The Great Dictator\" this film strikes an uneasy chord with modern viewers as they recognize similar tension being felt today. The other two films either address a grievance that is too old for most people to feel or not address any grievance at all and focus purely on comedy. This movie does just the opposite and seems to use comedy only to whipsaw the viewer back to the harsh reality of racial tension. The historical context is extremely important in this movie as it was released around 30 years after desegregation, that is still long enough for most adults to have parents who lived through segregation and live in communities that had wounds that had not even had a chance to heal. This makes the cinematic devices that Spike Lee uses all the more powerful. Some unique devices he uses is following more than one character, while Mookie is the \"main\" character, the audience does not necessarily get invested in his story, but rather they get exposed to multiple different characters and their story. In one famous scene, Spike Lee has the actors engage directly with the camera as they spew racial slurs, making the audience feel emotionally involved. As a film reviewer, I cannot deny the skill that went into this film, even if I feel that the film brought out the worst in humanity without providing any sort of light at the end of the tunnel. Which in the case of racial tension, everyone should be searching for.",

Lee crafts a film that is just as relevant today as it was 33 years ago. The highlight for me was the entire third act. A cathartic release of almost 90 minutes of tension that Spike Lee had been deliberately concoting, like some sort of machievellian chess genius. Most every small piece of dialogue or setpiece satisfyingly comes together in the end. This film might be straight into my Top 20 the more I think about it.",

The film takes place at a setting that is reminiscent of Brooklyn, NY. It depicts a time of there being unadulterated hatred towards anyone that was not of the same race. The film highlighted a time where black Americans felt isolated but also taken advantage of by other races. The film highlights moments of inequality concerning how people of color were thought of as less than but businesses were being established in predominantly black communities by that of other races. The films out loud approach to speaking against injustice can be credited to other the actor of the past like Charlie Chaplin. He was the first of his kind to make a movie that was comedic but also highly focus on matters that would to some be considered political in nature or hyper focus on the inequalities faced. \nThe film Do the Right Thing takes place on a hot sweltering day. Spike Lee depicts this by having only hues of red shown on the screen he also shows the characters in a manner where there are sweating profusely. It is know that to further help the appearance of it being a hot summer day he places a heat lamp attached to the camera so it can cast a wave of heat across the screen. Multiple characters are seen outside attempting to find something to do with themselves to get through the unrelenting heat. But while this is taking place certain characters such as Buggin Out are trying to begin a protest against what he feels in racial discrimination against a neighborhood pizza shop owner. Not until there is a tragedy that befalls the neighborhood does Buggin Out gets what he's been vying for the whole day.\nI personally enjoyed the film but just as most things that are noted to be a comedy I fail to see the comedic parts of this film. For me it was entertaining and made me think of all the ways that black Americans push themselves forward in society and held themselves back. I also saw maybe a rawer version then what I was ready for of how different races thought out each other. This film is very thought provoking and still relevant in today's time.",

I found it, I watched, and I have to say. It's worth it. A lot. The plot revolves around one day in a New York neighborhood during a heatwave and the interactions between its inhabitants. The wide variety of bizarre characters includes our protagonist Mookie, Italian American pizza store owners Sal, Vito and Pino, Mookie's friends Buggin' Out, Radio Raheem and Smiley, The Mayor and many others. It just so happens that the heatwave intensifies the racial tensions in the area, and it all leads to a pretty shocking climax. I gotta say that, despite being a little too provocative and supportive of his ideologies, Spike Lee makes a damn good point in this film. It's what got me thinking in the end of the film: That in racism, there is no right and wrong, there is no bad and good guy. In the end, everyone suffers. And that's the amazing thing about this movie. That all the characters are equally charming-lovable and easy to hate. They are replete with personality and fascinating qualities. The screenplay really makes the most out of its simple premise. The pacing is just perfect, and the film doesn't drag. Instead, it feels like every scene amplifies the tension. All until the extremely shocking climax, which got me on the edge of my seat. It was heartbreaking and tense. It raises the question of whether any of the characters really \"did the right thing\" that night, further highlighting the theme of the film: the futility of racism and extreme prejudice. Everything else about the film is just perfect. The unnerving and constantly moving cinematography. The colorful art direction, which provides us with an accurate representation of a hot summer day. The editing and sound design is immersive. The costumes and make up are all appropriate for the era. The soundtrack is wonderful.

Films exploring such intense subject matter as interracial anger, violence and injustice could easily be made to feel didactic and heavy-handed. Along similar lines, such a work might suffer from lack of universal empathy, presenting a one-sided perspective that unfairly simplifies the conditions feeding into the societal maelstrom. \"Do the Right Thing\" wisely declines to heft such burdens, instead dazzling the viewer with a generally exuberant experience with attitude to spare. We relish a perspective that ultimately proves inclusive by dealing head on with the virtues and the faults of every participant involved, regardless of race, color or creed. In Spike Lee's world, there are no dyed-in-the-wool heroes or villains, there is merely humanity encumbered with the quiet yet undeniable baggage of repressed anger and mistrust. Watching \"Do the Right Thing\" is an edifying and deeply moving experience, precisely because neither quality seeks to upstage the other.",

Set in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn on a sweltering summer's day, it focuses on the activity around Sal's Famous Pizzeria, owned and operated by Italians in a primarily black neighborhood, and culminates in police brutality and violence.  While some may find Lee's direction objectionable (odd camera angles, breaking of the ‘fourth wall', etc…), it effectively keeps things off balance, which was no doubt his intent.  The dialogue is effective, the cast is fantastic, the performances are excellent (especially Ossie Davis and John Turturro), and the warm color palette helps to accentuate the rising temperature, both literally and figuratively.",

The movie was a snap shot of what hasn't changed even with awareness, great leadership and time. Systemic racism and violation of human rights, police brutality all wrapped up in comical version of reality. The chit chatter of the elders who would sit out by their windows or sit by the corner discussing the events in the neighborhood created the atmosphere and tone of the movie. The conversation would reference the feeling and mood expressed within the community. The scene was explicit especially when the racial thoughts were verbalized of each ethic group the name calling and stereotype associated with the different races, Asian, Hispanic, Italian and African. I would rate this movie a 4 out of 5 because it was a classic expression of real-life issues expressed through film. The movie was inspired by the racially motivated killing of a black man and elderly woman shot by the NYPD the movie remains a classic because of the historical devalued lives of African Americans. Which is why I choose the heading the more things change the more things remain the same, scenes from this movie eliminate the recent riots and murder of George Floyd.

            "content": "Throughout the entire movie, the director Spike Lee manages to increase the tension between the different racial groups in a small neighborhood in New York until it bursts at the end, transmitting a feeling of anger and impotence. The movie released in 1989 had a significant impact on the American population showing the black experience of that era as there was still strong violence against black people and multiple riots such as the Miami one in January. \n\nDo the right thing is the story of a pizza delivery guy called Mookie (Spike Lee) during a sweltering day in Brooklyn. The neighborhood is racially diverse as the pizzeria owners Sal (Danny Aiello) and his sons Pino (John Turturro) and Vito (Richard Edson) are American Italian, also, there are an Asian family and Latin people, however, the vast majority are black people. Because of this, the relationship between them is not the better. \n\nThe movie directed, produced, and written by Spike Lee describes the common life of black people and the racism suffered in the United States. During the entire film, the figures of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, two relevant men who fought against racism against black people, I really like their meaning in the film, as Luther King defends the nonviolence and Malcolm X the violence against oppressions. \n\nLike in The Great Dictator by Charles Chaplin, it emphasized a lot on the discrimination against people from diverse cultures different from the stereotypical white one, motivated by the belief of white racial supremacy. Lee's movie focuses on the stereotypes of the fight of black and white people, and in the Chaplin's one, we see the strong hate feeling against Jewish people. \n\nSomething that characterizes Spike Lee is his knowledge of the several types of shots to transmit different feelings. He uses Dutch Angles in which the camera is tilted to one side, this type of camera shot, transmits vertigo, chaos, and disorientation. Zoom is also another technique he uses to transmit movement between the characters; besides that, the public is the camera, making a bigger connection between the characters and the spectators.  \n\nIn conclusion, I really like the development of the film, the charismatic characters, the dramatic turns, and the meaning of the camera in the film. I would recommend this movie to everybody; Spike Lee's work is worth it watching.",

            "content": "Do The Right Thing is a 1989 film that was directed, written, and produced by Spike Lee, who also plays the role of Mookie. The movie also stars Danny Aiello as Sal, Ossie Davis as Da Mayor, and Bill Nunn as Radio Raheem. Do The Right Thing takes place over the course of one hot summer day in a Brooklyn, New York neighborhood and examines racial tensions within the community. \n\tProduction highlights include cinematography by Ernest Dickerson, production design by Wynn Thomas, and a musical score composed by Bill Lee, Spike Lee's father. Thomas emphasizes the oppressive heat by filling the mise-en-scène with warm colors, also reflected in the clothing selected by costume designer Ruth Carter. The pervasive heat adds to the film's suspense and emphasizes the underlying rage that is always on the verge of breaching the surface. Additionally, Bill Lee's jazzy musical score starkly contrasts with the diegetic soundtrack from boom boxes or the radio in the film, which features artists like Public Enemy. This shift reflects the film's tendency to flip unexpectedly between calm and chaos, peace and rage.  \nUnlike a typical commercial movie, Dickerson often uses a canted angle, skewing the horizon line so that characters seem about to fall out of the frame. This technique emphasizes the imbalance within the community and adds to the tense atmosphere of the film. The film is also unique because it does not focus on one central character, but instead emphasizes each member of the community equally. Do The Right Thing highlights Spike Lee's versatility; his deep involvement with the film on so many levels results in a brilliant, cohesive examination of racial inequity in the United States. \n\tDo The Right Thing was partly inspired by the deaths of Michael Griffith and Eleanor Bumpurs. Griffith was a black man killed in 1986 by a group of white men after leaving a pizza parlor, alluded to by Sal's pizza parlor in the film, and Bumpurs was a disabled black woman killed by the NYPD in 1984 in her home after falling behind on her rent. Both incidents ignited racial tensions at the time. Do The Right Thing shows the need for social change in the United States, calling attention to the widespread latent racism in the country. Lee's film depicts an unsustainable society where violence is always on the verge of erupting, for which all groups share the blame equally. \n\tOverall, I highly recommend Do The Right Thing for its honest portrayal of racial tensions in the United States and for its use of multifaced, complex characters that reflect the intricate contradictions of real humans. Characters in the film are not good or bad; they are both good and bad. Characters are sympathetic until racist, genial until violent. These complex characters reflect how there is a lot more to racism in the real world than just black and white. \nDo The Right Thing remains highly relevant to this day and is noteworthy for its ability to almost predict the future. The film is both of and ahead of its time, as eerily prophetic as The Great Dictator was in 1940. Do The Right Thing seemed to forewarn audiences of issues such as gentrification and the LA riots and is even more relevant today in the wake of the BLM movement. As the film reaches its close, Sal mentions that it is only going to get hotter out and he seems to be talking about a lot more than just the weather. Spike Lee can sense the future but, like his characters, is powerless against the heat.",

The film Highlights how the diversity in the neighborhood leads to rising tension, but also contributes to great relationships as well. The film is also very comical being full of comic relief and having many portions of the movie being uplifting mixed in with the discussion of heavy topics. The more uplifting topics allow for the heavy topics to feel more real as it is not overbearing and feels realistic as the good is mixed in with the bad. The film highlights the very prevalent issue of racial tensions in the US and shares how although all people are the same and deal with similar issue we still fight and blame each other for hardships. The film was made during the 1980's when police brutality was extremely prevalent, and this film was an avenue to highlight this terrible injustice. Sadly, many years later the themes of this film are still extremely prevalent, and the lessons being taught in the film have stood the test of time. The lesson in this film is like lesson seen in the Great Dictator as the focus of the film is to highlight that people are all the same and should not fight with each other, but instead fight against evil. The film does an amazing job of touching on complex issues while remaining enjoyable. I really enjoyed watching the film and would absolutely suggest watching the film. The fact that this year, 2021, we are still dealing with police brutality issues. It is also important to mention that it is enjoyable film to watch as there are a lot of good jokes and situations that are uplifting. The uplifting fun parts of the film do a great job of setting the more complex topics as the comedy of the film is the main story of the film. I would recommend this film!",

The ambiguity provided by the conflicting historical quotes made the movie more of an enigma than it otherwise would have. I didn't love the movie, but that's primarily because in real life I put a lot of thought and effort into handling myself in a way that is first and foremost considerate to others and thus I couldn't find any common ground with Raheem refusing to turn down his music or Buggin' Out insisting on getting his way but also couldn't find any with Sal aggressively dismissing any notion of putting some important people up on his wall when they represent nearly his entire customer base.

            "content": "Lee dives into racially-motivated violence with a deft hand and a eye for character, refusing to be beholden to the identity politics that would come to define many 'black' films in subsequent years (including many of Lee's own). Instead, characters are nuanced and distinctive, with their own ambitions and worries independent of the color of their skin (e.g., Pino's desire to escape the family business mirroring Mookie's drive to move up and provide a better life for himself and his family), and how these desires combine with preconceptions and personality influence the many perspectives on race shown in the film. These range from misdirected hate, to unfocused rage stemming from idealism, to passive disinterest, but each playing a role in the instigation of an act of violence that accomplished nothing other than needless suffering, failing to address the systemic issues that ensure the continuation of their current environment. Still as relevant in 2020 as it was 30 years ago, even if Turturro is now known mostly for acting like a moron in a neverending slew of garbage Transformers movies. (4.5/5)",

Mookie works at a local pizzeria owned by Sal (Danny Aiello), an Italian-American who has been in the neighborhood for 25 years. Sal's eldest son Pino (John Turturro) does not get along with Mookie. Because of this, Pino is at odds with both his father, who refuses to leave the neighborhood, and his younger brother Vito, who is friendly with Mookie. While at Sal's, Mookie's friend Buggin' Out, questions Sal about his \"Wall of Fame\", a wall decorated with photos of famous Italian-Americans. Buggin' Out demands that Sal put up pictures of black celebrities since Sal's pizzeria is in a black neighborhood. Sal replies that it is his business, and that he can have whoever he wants on the wall. Buggin' Out attempts to start a protest over the Wall of Fame. During the day, local teenagers open a fire hydrant and douse the other neighbors to beat the heat wave before officers intervene. After a phone call, Mookie and Pino begin arguing over race. Mookie confronts Pino about his negative attitudes towards African Americans, although the latter's favorite celebrities are black. Pino expresses his contempt for African Americans to Sal, but Sal insists that he will not leave the neighborhood. That night, Buggin' Out, Radio Raheem, and Smiley march into Sal's and demand that Sal change the Wall of Fame. Raheem's boombox is blaring and Sal demands that he turn it off, but he refuses. Buggin' Out calls Sal and sons guinea bastards, and threatens to close down the pizzeria until they change the Wall of Fame. Frustrated and angry, Sal calls Buggin' Out a the n word and destroys Raheem's boombox with a bat. Raheem attacks Sal, leading to a fight that spills out into the street and attracts a crowd. The police arrive, break up the fight, and apprehend Raheem and Buggin' Out. Despite the pleas of onlookers, one officer refuses to release his chokehold on Raheem, killing him. Realizing that Raheem has been killed in front of witnesses, the officers place his body in the back of a squad car and drive off...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Smart, vibrant and urgent without being didactic, \"Do the Right Thing\" is one of Spike Lee's most fully realized efforts – and one of the most important films of the 1980s.\" Both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert ranked the film as the best of 1989, and later each ranked it as one of the top 10 films of the decade (No. 6 for Siskel and No. 4 for Ebert). Ebert later added the film to his list of The Great Movies.[ According to online film resource They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?, Do the Right Thing is the most acclaimed film of 1989. New York Times film critic Wesley Morris has called Do the Right Thing his favorite film.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success and received numerous accolades, including Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for Aiello's portrayal of Sal the pizzeria owner. It is often listed among the greatest films of all time. In 1999, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress, in its first year of eligibility, and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. Spike Lee´s third movie is as current a ever in September 2020. The racial tension and the killing of Radio Raheem is too close to reality and the death of George Floyd this year. The racism we experience still today, needs to be addressed again and again until we will reach a way out of it. There´s something in the vibrant visual language in \"Do The Right Thing\" I like, but the acting is also a bit wobbly and the production does have a amateurish vibe over it at times when re-seeing it today. But, it was interesting to re-see \"Do The Right Thing\" again after so many years.",

With his third feature, writer/director Lee crafted a mesmerizing film about race relations that still holds up today. Using captivating cinematography, Lee draws viewers into a neighborhood torn apart by racial tensions. From intimate close-ups to stunning establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's setting. It gives the film a tense and unsettling atmosphere that captures the explosive anger of racism. The sets, color palette and musical score are all carefully chosen, combining to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. It is hard to not praise the powerful performances from the cast. Spike Lee delivers one of the best performances of his career as Mookie. With riveting expressions, he conveys the fear, anxiety and righteous anger of a black man that becomes embroiled in racial conflict. The supporting cast, which includes the scene-stealing Danny Aiello, is also worthy of recognition. Although \"Do the Right Thing\" is undeniably unforgettable, ultimately it is not a flawless film. If there's a minor drawback to the movie, it's controversial themes may not appeal to everyone. Nevertheless, fans of Spike Lee will definitely enjoy \"Do the Right Thing\" and so will movie-goers seeking timely entertainment. Nearly 30 years after its release, the film remains essential viewing with a message that is more relevant than ever. In light of the recent Black Lives Matter Movement, it's a timely reminder of the never-ending racial wars that African-Americans continue to fight till this day.",

            "content": "I won't write too much about this one, as anything I could say has been said before by people much more qualified than myself, but man does this movie resonate today. It pulls together so many aspects of the racially unjust world that we live in, black relationships to cops, matters of ownership in a community, loss of black life vs. property damage, etc. It lays out the tension that existed in 1989 and clearly still exists today. I won't say anything about taking sides, whether Mookie did the right thing. What I will say, is that so much of the dialogue between Buggin' Out, Sal, Radio Rahim, and Peno resonates with the conversation that happens on the internet today. And it's painful to watch because if Sal wouldn't blow up at the slightest indisgression, or Buggin' Out could start a conversation about the pictures on the wall, or Sal could have a real conversation with his son about his racism, the climax could be avoided. But of course it doens't work that way. These intensely personal and generational difference can't be calm. Throughout this movie I wondered if Sal was racist. Spike says he was, Aiello says he wasn't. I get both sides. To some degree, most everyone in the movie was prejudiced, but today, there is a more nuanced distinction that pertains to this movie: the difference between not being racist, and being anti-racist. It's the leap from feeling called out for your debatable views, and making a stand to help end a system of segregation. Sal could swing both ways, as he shows love for his black patrons, Mookie, his sister, but also is quick to throw out racial epithets when he's confronted by Radio Rahim, but Peno is undoubtedly a racist. If Sal were anti-racist, he would have stomped out the flames of Peno's hate before they turned the community against their pizza joint. He would have listened to what Buggin' Out was saying about not having black leaders on the wall of fame. But he didn't, and see how it turns out - shitty for everyone.",

            "content": "Wake up! Wake up! Up you wake!\"\n\nI had this on my watch-list for quite a while now since I joined this site, because when it comes to movies labelled as classic are often the hardest for me to truly tackle, but with everything that's been going on recently, I thought the time is right to watch Spike Lee's masterpiece. I know logging this in isn't anything new with everyone else doing the same, but you also have to keep in mind the reasons why a movie that explores the struggles of American racism, police brutality, and racial stereotyping still hits close to our lives, especially 30 years after its release.\n\nThe hottest day of the year in the neighborhood of Brooklyn - where heat, frustration, and tension quickly rises up to the surface in extreme temperatures, where the intensity is felt. A clash of cultures with African American, Latino, East Asian and Italian American that drives the story forward.\n\nI am honestly blown away by this movie.\n\nWhat I loved about 'Do the Right Thing' is how all the characters in the movie are not the most moral people and would commit questionable acts, which have sparked debates from audiences over the years. However, it is less about understanding them or finding redeemable qualities, but more to do with recognising their anger. The movie does not ask you to pick a side, but just to observer how both sides can be wrong sometimes. We are shown how everyone is talking negatively about the other race, so you should not always take it too seriously, and that you're not always the victim. The only voice of reason in the whole movie is the character Da Mayor, played beautifully by the late Ossie Davis. He does what the title of the movie is saying, and yet no one takes any notices of him. The movie displays different viewpoints from variety of voices.\n\nThere's a great scene where one person of each race group talks shit about the other race in a racist statement. Spike Lee intentional filmed the scene to identify how racism in different forms of colour are all equal. Lee shot every racial statement in the scene identical from the other ones. The message becomes loud and clear, which is that if you're a racist, you're a racist, no matter what colour skin you are.\n\nStill, racial themes aside, there is still some humorous scenes that made me chuckle. The conversations between characters were both funny and yet intriguing to listen, which was apparently improvised by some of the actors. I said this once and I will say it again, I like it when the director lets actors work freely on set.\n\nThe performances from everyone were all excellent and all the characters are defined through the actor's portrayal, which makes every single one of them memorable.\n\nDanny Aiello is brilliant as the sweaty and tough Sal, who works hard at his business at the Pizzeria. Sal is respectful to everyone if you do not push his buttons. Even Spike Lee who is not only the director, writer, and producer of the movie, but also stars in the movie as well. Lee is a solid actor and adds a lot of depth to his character through his performance. His character Mookie is a young and tired looking delivery man who works for Sal's pizzeria.\n\nThe character Radio Raheem played by Bill Nunn is the most interesting character in the movie. His character gives the audience a clear perspective of his frustration for us to identify. This is best examined when he shows Mookie (Spike Lee) his new rings and tells him the story of \"Love and Hate\", because we as people are constantly battling both negative and positive sides of ourselves.\n\nGiancarlo Esposito who plays Buggin Out, a lively character who causes the most trouble in the movie, and attempts to start a boycott on Sal's pizza parlor after realising there's no African-Americans on Sal wall of frame, despite coming in three times a day until he finally notices. I love the satire of an African-American walking into an Italian pizza place asking why there's no Malcolm X pictures. I also didn't recognise Esposito at first, because I couldn't believe this is the same man who played the sinister villain in Breaking Bad. Terrific actor.\n\nThe cinematography features a lot of bizarre perspectives and camera angles, which are used to great effect and shows us the characters point of view of the world. The colour palette of the movie is fantastic and gives the urban streets a vibrant feel. The opening credits is one of the best I've seen in a while and the best definition of attitude.\n\nI can see why people have labelled this as Spike Lee's best work, and it deserves that title.\n\nOverall rating: The current situation of police brutality globally, not just in the US, still cries out for justice and change in the corrupt system. In 2020, you would think that things have changed for the better, but it seems that we still have a long way to go. The movie was not just a head of its time, but present of its time, and how it is still present with us today.",

The film was directed, produced and written by Spike Lee whose primary goal of the film was have the audience spark conversation about the racial tensions in society. Do The Right Thing has a very large cast which exhibits the relevance to society by making this film relatable. The film is set in Bedford, Brooklyn in a mostly Africa-American neighborhood along with Italian-American's and some Latino's as well. Spike Lee whom also acts in the film was a key player named Mookie. A few other key players is Danny Aiello, who plays Sal, Ossie Davis who plays Da Mayor, Ruby Dee as Mother Sister, and Giancarlo Esposito as Buggin' Out. \n\n\tThis film all takes place in a community named Bedford on one of the hottest summer days. Tensions arise when Buggin' Out calls out Sal's pizza shop for not displaying any pictures of black people on his wall of fame. The pizza shop is located in a community with mostly African Americans, which is what most of Sal's clientele is. However, Sal believes that he can display whom ever he wants since it is his store. Mookie intervenes and attempts to calm down Buggin' Out which only results in him wanting to protest against the pizza store. Radio Raheem joins Buggin' Out because he also got into an argument with Sal about playing music too loud on his boom box. As the day hot day goes into the evening Radio Raheem and Buggin' Out march into Sal's pizza shop demanding Sal to switch out the paintings on the walls. This leads to violence when Sal breaks Radio Raheem's boom box  resulting in a huge fight in the street. Police come to the scene, Buggin' Out is arrested, while Radio Raheem is chocked to death by a police offer. This entire scenario makes the neighborhood blame Sal, Pino and Vito leading to their restaurant being destroyed by the crowd. Mookie sneaks back into the restaurant and puts up two photos of quotes, one of Malcolm X, and one of MLK. After the altercation and the killing of Radio Raheem, the city decides to investigate the incident and death. \n\n\tSpike Lee did a phenomenal job in this film which ended up receiving recognition by the Library of Congress and National Film Registry. The making behind this film was inspired by true events that allowed Lee to create this script. Lee wanted this film to have cultural impact on society and it definitely sparked controversies and got people to talk. This film is now played at schools during class which resembles the positive impact it has had on society. \n\n\tThis movie truly exemplifies the effects of visual communication that cinema can have on its viewers. The fact that there were only warm colors in this film truly emphasized how hot of a day it was. Also, the camera techniques truly allowed the audience to fully understand the relationship between the characters, which is definitely something that stuck out to me in this film. Buggin' Out's resilience to having a famous black person on Sal's wall truly depicts the want for social change. The dutch angles of the camera that Lee decided to use is a perfect way to appeal to the audiences emotions and portray the message of the film. \n\n\tDo the Right Thing delivers a message that is so realistic and depicts how some of our societies need social change when it comes to discrimination. The fact that Radio Raheem was killed by a police officer, definitely exemplifies the racism and violence that we are still currently facing in our society. By portraying photos of quotes from Malcolm X and MLK secretly in the Sal's restaurant, it perfectly relates to the discrimination society faced throughout history. I find it very impressive that Spike Lee was able to act, produce, direct and write this entire film. Spike Lee definitely resembles Charles Chaplin because they both acted, directed, wrote and produced their films. Also, they both created a film regarding an issue they believed needed social recognition because it was an issue relevant to society.",

During the day, Buggin Out, played by Giancarlo Esposito, comes to buy a slice and complains about the lack of African American representation on the wall of fame. This simple complaint spirals into a day of great violence and tragedy. \n\nOne important part of Do the Right Thing is the use of the song Fight the Power by Public Enemy. The movie opens with this song, and it really helps set the mood for the whole movie. Throughout the movie, we hear the song playing on Radio Raheem's Stereo. Radio Raheem, played by Bill Nunn, is defined entirely by this song. Without such a powerful song, Do the Right Thing would lose a lot of the drive and connection that can be felt. The unanimity created by Fight the Power can be contrasted with the soundtrack of Napoleon Dynamite. In Napoleon, the soundtrack features songs from many time periods and genres. This helps show that Napoleon's message can be applied to all generations. Both movie's soundtrack help solidify the message of the movie.\n\nSpike Lee specifically sought out Public Enemy to create a song for Do the Right Thing. After Public Enemy's second album released, Spike Lee knew he wanted them to make the song. Fight the Power appears in both Do the Right Thing and Public Enemy's third album, Fear of a Black Planet. Fight the Power has since become Public Enemy's most popular song, and is considered by many one of the greatest songs ever written. \n\nDo the Right Thing tells a story that will likely be relevant for generations to come. I would recommend watching it. By the end, you'll almost certainly have Fight the Power stuck in your head.",

The people in this community are from different races and backgrounds of life but they all share the same community, when you mix different backgrounds and the heat something is bond to happen. We get introduced to several characters and we see what Brooklyn looks like through their eyes, Sal (Danny Aiello) owns a pizza shop but he doesn't like his patrons. He has a wall to worship his race of people and when asked why there are no blacks on the wall, he scoffs at the notion even though his business is in a black community. Radio Raheem is the complete opposite of this character Sal , he holds up his black race of people with no apologizes. Mookie played by Spike Lee just wants to get along with everyone but its impossible when there is so much bias within this small community of people. He finally breaks with the death of Radio Raheem at the hands of the police. The social impact message to me is we must all learn to live together and accept each other's differences.\nThe cinematic device used in this movie was the \"heat\" with each minute it was getting hotter and hotter figuratively and literally. The ending of the movie is very much similar to the ending of the Great Dictator. We get this speech looking straight into the camera which make me think the person is now talking to me about his personal views on what was revealed in the movie. \"Racism\"",

The Mayor is one of the most endearing characters I've seen on-screen in a while; Sal is one of the most interesting, along with Mookie.

In order to portray society, they used super stereotypical behavior that I feel like made the issue seem less significant. For instance, Radio Raheem with his iconic radio. The black community wasn't all about carrying a boom box, it was about gang violence and tension. I will say though, what happens to him at the end does portray the elements see in today's society with police brutality. Another reason I believe that the film is a poor portrayal of a serious issue is that they focus the issue on the lack of diversity in Sal's Pizzeria. In my opinion, if pizza is of Italian origin, how could they expect a bunch of colored people on the wall. They could have chosen a serious topic in where for instance someone White got picked over a person of color for no legitimate reason. This is why the plot makes no sense. It's not a logical situation. However, I can appreciate the fact that they tried to be as realistic as possible, it just made no sense.

Building up one big climatic riot- for two whole hours- on which the entire film hinges upon is brimmed with series of hilarious political humor that tickles you throughout the course. Basically, what Spike Lee; the writer-director, has to do and does is create a mundane environment in the street where each character- no matter how much small- factors in on this huge controversial event. And he does it with such flamboyant command over the film, that you are left in awe of its sheer practicality.\n\nTake the sweet flirty relationship between De Mayor (Ossie Davis) and Mother Sister (Ruby Dee), for instance, their trajectory on how their bittersweet equation evolves into an affectionate sentimental moment is enough to carve out the meat of the or the leap of the imagination it shows of Lee's. The other tiny sequences holds up grudges like fascism on admiring the love for celebrities or an invasion of a third party in an ongoing cold war or fighting for the rights to listen and express the views.\n\nThese are the provoking notions that charges them and us to reach a cathartic climax. As much as brilliant Lee is off camera, his onscreen investment often comes off as misdirected, since he fails to obliviate his authority off screen. Nevertheless, from support like John Turturro as a hot head Pino and Samuel L. Jackson as a sharp narrator named- or claimed- Love Daddy on a local radio, he is in safe hands. Personally, Danny Aiello as Sal and often the senior among this group, steals the show for me with his brilliant frustrated performance that is ready to burst out any second.

The main focus in the film is the black community. Directed by Spike Lee, the film starts on a very hot day in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn, NY. In this predominantly black neighborhood there are also Latinos, Koreans and whites, and although divided, everyone knows each other. Here we are introduced to Salâ(TM)s Pizzeria, owned and operated by Italian-American Sal (Danny Aiello) and his 2 sons Vito (Richard Edson) and Pino (John Turturro). Although this pizzeria has been in this neighborhood for many years and popular in the community, throughout the movie we find that tension can run high between its black patrons and owners. A clear depiction of this is when Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) demands to know why there are only pictures of Italian Americans on the walls, followed by ârarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some sayâ?. This is where Mookie (played by Spike Lee) steps in to ease the tension. I think that in this film it is in-fact Mookie, who to an extent struggles with doing the right thing as he desires to balance all the different relationships, responsibilities in his life and tries to be the calming force in a community that is separated by race and fighting for power. \n\tTensions continue to run high in the neighborhood between members of different races, just like the extreme heat. The event that took place in the pizzeria escalates and Buggin Out and Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) return to the location during closing time demanding that Sal change the pictures on the walls. While this argument is taking place Radio Raheemâ(TM)s BoomBox is loud, and after refusing to turn it down, Sal beats the BoomBox with a bat in a rage. A fight breaks out between Sal and Radio Raheem which leads to the death of Radio Raheem at the hands of the cops in-front of a crowd. This is Mookieâ(TM)s turning point as he throws a garbage can at the window of the pizzeria and does what to him is, the right thing. To stand up and fight for the black community. A riot breaks out and the pizzeria gets destroyed. The riot angered at what this Italian-American pizzeria has caused, they start moving towards the Korean family market. However, they stop after the owner yells \"I no white! I black! You, me, same! We same!\"\n\nProduction Highlights: I think that a production highlight of the film is Smiley played by Roger Guenveur Smith). Although he doesnâ(TM)t/canâ(TM)t say much his persistence of wanting to speak about Malcom X, random appearances in different scenes is yet another reminder of what the film is about. The need to fight for power and racial equality. This is also the social justice and historic context in the film. The fight that was fought by leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X for African-Americans.\n\nCinematic Devices Used: The biggest cinematic device used in this film that separates it from all others if the emphasis that it makes on the extreme hot weather which relates to the high tensions and tempers in the neighborhood. You can see this in the sets created and costumes. Dutch tilt and eye-level angel is used and to dramatize the emotions of characters zooms/closeups are used as well.\n\nOverall Recommendation/Conclusion: Personally, I was not a big fan of this film. This film is similar to The Great Dictator in the sense that itâ(TM)s calling for a need for change and equality. Both movies also expose the fights, struggles, and racism that Jews in the Holocaust and African-Americans face, I think The Great Dictator does a better job delivering the message. I didnâ(TM)t really like the amount of violence Spike Lee used throughout the film. Although this was/is a reality still, I found it difficult to find the message hope or attempt to touch the viewersâ(TM) hearts like Charlie Chaplin did at the end of the film. Instead I think the film suggests that violence is the only way to stand up and fight for the rights, freedom and equality of a community.",

However, in a given 24-hour period depicted in the movie, the tensions run as high as the oppressive heat wave beating down on Bedford Stuyvesant where it begs to question if members of the community in the movie did the right thing?  \nUpset that Sal only has pictures of white Italian-Americans on the walls of the pizza shop, Buggin Out demands that he add Black people to represent the neighborhood and more importantly his patrons who support his business.  Sal disagrees.  Consequently, Buggin Out starts to spread the word to boycott Salâ(TM)s Pizzeria.  A real-life story which we hear about in todayâ(TM)s news and inevitably when we look for answers we question did everyone behave accordingly and do the right thing?  Was there social justice or injustice?  When will we all learn to live as one and finally come to grip with the social change needed to allow us to unite?  \nDespite being filmed in 1989, this very same question comes up when it comes to racial tensions getting in the way of all of us living as one united nation and in harmony.  One of the cinematic techniques used to convey the tensions and uneasiness in movies is the Dutch Tilt or Dutch Angle.  Keep a look out for how the camera is tilted in most of the movie and subsequently changes towards the end of the movie.  There are also Zoom shots of characters who suddenly become confrontational â\" sending the message that they are not so happy.  The lighting is also purposely coming from the bottom or side, an indication in movies that danger is lurking.  \nOne of the things which caught my attention is the fact that Lee, the Director, showed Blacks and Latinos as well as Blacks and Koreans in arguments.  It wasnâ(TM)t just Black vs. White.  A beautiful reminder that we must all guard ourselves of potential unconscious biases.  As I think about the movie Napoleon Dynamite, I am reminded of the tensions running high between high school students of the same race.  Consciously or unconsciously intended, the bullying and mistreatment shown on both movies is inappropriate and conduit for unnecessary division within our society - back then and now.  If I had to guess, both movies are reminiscent of the 1970-80s where such conversations of bullying and tolerance of differences were not spoken about.  However, today we have to the opportunity to use these movies to open the dialogue about the power of our differences and doing the right thing.\nMy recommendation for this movie is 4 stars!",

            "content": "Do the Right Thing is a film from the 1980s directed and written by Spike Lee, who also stars in the film. Lee took on this film to show the true racism and violence that has actually occurred, which sparked thoughts of social change and justice. The overall message of this film shows how violence and racism are never the answer, but based on history is what ends up happening. Are people just used to looking down on African American neighborhoods? This film sparks thought on how society as a whole is still racist and needs to change. This film also shows through the actions of the characters how social justice was thought to be achieved, but in the end, it made the neighborhood even more tragic. This sparks more thoughts on how change and justice need to be viewed and taken seriously. Historically, African Americans have been not treated well by White people and those of other races. In this film, you see the White people and Asian people seem to think they are better than the rest of the African American neighborhood. This has shown time and time again, that history may have changed some from the times of slavery, but history repeats itself and racism is still very relevant. This message can relate back to the film The Great Dictator, which came out in 1940. The Great Dictator was about the Holocaust and how society needs to take a stand for this before it becomes a bigger problem. In Do the Right Thing, the message begs society to make a change, but also shows how society has failed the African American neighborhoods and race time and time again. Spike Lee took inspiration for this film from actual violence that had occurred and was able to portray them in a way that showed the struggle of this neighborhood and how the violence can easily escalate from racism and turn tragic. Lee took very intense angles during the major fight/violence scene at the end to really portray the impact of this violence. \nOverall, Do the Right Thing had a very impactful message that is relevant historically and today. This film was well done and it is a film that people should consider viewing.",

Do the Right Thing is set in Brooklyn during the 1980â(TM)s mostly focusing around a local pizzeria called Salâ(TM)s Famous Pizzeria. The story mainly follows Mookie who is employed at Salâ(TM)s Famous Pizzeria played by Spike Lee, Sal the owner of Salâ(TM)s Famous Pizzeria played by Danny Aiello, and Buggin Out a loyal customer played by Giancarlo Esposito. On the Hottest day of the year Buggin Out enters Salâ(TM)s Famous Pizzeria for some pizza. While he is having his pizza, he notices that the Wall of Fame at Salâ(TM)s Famous Pizzeria was made up entirely of Italian Americans. With Salâ(TM)s Famous Pizzeria being in a predominately African-American area. Buggin Out requests that Sal put up some pictures of famous African-Americans. Sal refused Buggin Outâ(TM)s request. This caused quite the scene and Buggin Out lashed out by asking everyone to boycott Salâ(TM)s Famous Pizzeria until Salâ(TM)s fixed the Wall of Fame. Mookie gets caught between the African-American community and his employment at Salâ(TM)s Famous Pizzeria. With the heat from the hottest day in Brooklyn and tensions building, things only get worse. Eventually, Buggin Out along with his friend Radio Raheem go back to Salâ(TM)s Famous Pizzeria to make their case again. This time things really get out of hand, and Sal makes a grave decision that starts all the violence. Do the Right Thing had few memorable comedic moments to me, but it definitely delivered a strong message. Throughout the whole movie, Spike Lee did a great job setting the mood and almost foreshadowing what would ultimately happen. The theme of fighting the power was apparent through the whole film especially during scenes with Radio Raheem. Spike Lee created this film during a time in America where there was a lot of mistreatment and injustices against the African-American communities. This film was a great way to speak out against these issues. The quotes by Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom X really tied the whole film together and hit hard after watching the ending of this film. This film also mirrors the theme in the movie The Great Dictator by Charlie Chaplin. Both are movies that focus on racial injustices and work to speak out against it. In conclusion this is a strong film with a profound message that still pertains to today. It was a little slow building up for me, but I enjoyed the Do the Right Thing overall. I donâ(TM)t see myself watching this film again, but its message will stick with me.",

            "content": "The bulk of the action in âDo the right thingâ? takes place on a street where three businesses stand out: a local radio station led by a charlatan announcer who plays good black music (Samuel L. Jackson), a grocery store run by a Korean couple and the pizzeria of Sal (Danny Aiello, who embroiders the paper), the only white business owner in the area where his two children also work (one of them fantastically played by John Turturro) and Mookie (Spike Lee), who is the protagonist and main movie driver.\n\nThe first part of the film, in which comedy clearly predominates, is dedicated to the study and portrait of the characters, most of them endearing and well-worked, between whom there are some ingenious and realistic dialogues. It also offers a nice picture of the everyday life of an African-American neighborhood in New York in a seemingly normal summer day. However, towards the middle of the film, and as the story progresses, an element of drama takes center stage.\n\nThe film, one of the first of Lee, was a great success and laid the foundations of the style that would later define its director: social criticism, intelligent dialogues, well-constructed archetypal characters. It also represented a revolution within American society given its direct message and radical exposure of the racial tensions in the country, a recurrent theme in the work of the director, intimately linked to different African-American movements and cultural manifestations of this community as, for example, hip hop, which has a clear representation in this work.\n\nPublic Enemy are the real protagonists in the soundtrack of the film, constantly steeped in its most classic themes, in addition to being named a multitude of times by several characters. Apart from rap, occasionally you can listen to a sax that soaks up some of the most bohemian scenes; and it is that there is a lot of urban culture in Do what you should, from the beginning credits, in which a girl appears dancing to the rhythm of hip hop, until that combative ending that closes the movie with quotes from Martin Luther King and Malcom X, going through that strong neighborhood feeling that floods the entire film and that Spike Lee manages to reflect masterly. In short, a work of reference of an essential filmmaker.",

The main theme is unity but that seems the break easily, many times throughout the film.  In the beginning, the film starts with an introduction of everyone on the block.  The middle shows how the block is not what itâ(TM)s cut out to be with many hiccups and high-tension situations, and finally closing with a massive riot over injustice. \n\nProduction Highlights (positive or negative) \n\nToward the end of film, a riot forms in light of Radio Raheemâ(TM)s death.  Their entire community almost gets burned to the ground due to the mob mentality of the black activists.  Spike Lee however, does not end the film there, the next day people of the community are shown having to clean up from what had happened the day prior. \n\nOverall Recommendation \n\nI would not recommend this movie due to the fact that focusing on the bad does not help for doing good.  Although some may say that racism is prevalent in America right now, two of my best friends are black and they believe the black community is stemming racism.  They say this due to the fact that the black communityâ(TM)s top influencers are continuously feeding young African Americanâ(TM)s minds that racism still exists, and they must protect their inner-community.  They too believe if people stop talking about it, then it will disappear.  \n\nConclusion \n\nRacism must end in America.  Every âgroupâ? will have their bad apple, this cannot be avoided.  However, in the general flow of things, I really do not believe there is as big of an issue as the media displays there to be. \n\nSocial Justice/Change Aspect \n\nThe entire film is based on the premise of race and the existence of racism in America. \n\nComparison\n\nI would compare this film to The Great Dictator in that the audience whom is watching both films empathize with the victims and have the urge to cheer them on. \n\nHistoric Context or Development Process\n\nMorgan Freeman, an influential figure in the African American community, once said the fastest way for racism is disappears is if society stop talking about it.  \n\nCinematic Device(s) Used\n\nWarm colors, heat waves in some scenes, color saturated, wide shots, canted angles, low angle shots.",

            "content": "In the final scenes of the film, Radio Raheem, and Smiley are recruited by Buggin Out to join his boycott of Sals pizzeria. Later that evening they go to Salâ(TM)s and Radio Raheem blasts âFight the Powerâ? while inside the pizzeria again. This time he turns it all the way up and refuses to turn it off. This escalates to the point where Sal destroys the radio with a baseball bat in order to stop the blaring music. Immediately Radio Raheem starts chocking Sal, and his two sons jump in to try to help their father. This continues to escalate as the police arrive on the scene to break up the fight. A group of African Americans are slowly gathering outside of the pizzeria trying to determine what the disturbance is about. As the fight pours out into the street the police officers break up the fight, but end up chocking Radio Raheem to death in the process. The police quickly leave the scene as a large group of African Americans witness the whole conflict in horror. The scene quickly deteriorates into full blown rioting and looting of Salsâ(TM) Pizzeria before the mob burns down the building. The film concludes with a conversation between Mookie and Sal regarding his weekly paycheck. The dialogue in this final scene offers a glimmer of hope for the future as they come to realize they need each other, and one is not greater than the other.\n\nThe film was very well produced with a great footage of the Bed-Stuy area during the 1980s. Since Spike Lee wrote, directed, produced and played the main character Mookie, he was able to create a true cinematic masterpiece. The metaphors and imagery that are presented in each scene aid in properly conveying the message of the film to the audience.\n\nThe social change aspects of this film play out in a post-civil rights movement era. The film takes place only 10 years or so after the civil rights movement. This is expressed by endless references to Malcom X and Martin Luther King Jr. A peaceful form of protest versus a violent form. The people whom live in the neighborhood of Bed-Stuy feel oppressed, discriminated against and broken down by their own country. There is a scene where a little girl is drawing a dream of hers in chalk on the street. It is a picture of a car in the driveway of a family home with her in the front. A classical depiction of the American dream. This was something that was not possible for her family, as she dreams for a brighter future. From the point of view of the characters in the film, African Americans had just received equal rights and protections under the civil rights act of 1964. The effects of the new legislature and mass protests were still playing out across the nation as racial tensions reached a boiling point during the period leading up to the civil rights movement. This memory was still very much so on the forefront of peopleâ(TM)s minds. Schools had just started to desegregate only a decade before. Many people whom were either a part of the civil rights movement or children of people who were, felt that they still had not been accepted and embraced by their fellow Americans. This feeling was perpetuated by endless examples of discrimination and life not getting better as a result of the movements accomplishments. This frustration is expressed throughout the film as the neighborhood openly conveys this message of inequality and the impact it continued to have on their lives.\n\nIn the film, Buggin Out wanted to protest the lack of African American photos in the pizzeria by holding a peaceful boycott of the business. Unfortunately this small boycott including only three people, escalated into a riot and a murder. This exemplifies that only through conversation and a greater understanding of one another can peace be achieved; otherwise everyone is doomed to feel the horrors that violence will provide. Furthermore, social changes are outlines in a scene in which a white bicyclist accidentally runs over Buggin Outsâ(TM) shoes. This culminates into an argument between a group of African American neighbors and this white man whom seems to have just purchased a brown stone on their street. In a predominately Hispanic/African American neighborhood where unemployment is high, and everyone is renting, gentrification had begun; to the detriment of the people who already lived there.",

            "content": "The film â~Do The Right Thingâ(TM) was written, directed, and produced by Spike Lee. It first aired in 1989. The story takes place in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, NY in a predominately African American neighborhood during the 1980s. There is a heatwave afflicting the whole region, and racial tensions run high at the neighborhood pizza place owned by Italians. The film tells a story of a pizza delivery man named Mookie, played by Spike Lee, whom works for a local Italian pizza placed called Sals. Sals pizzeria is owned by an Italian man named Sal, played by Danny Aiello. His two sons Vito, played by Richard Edson, and Pino, played by John Turturro work for their father at the pizzeria. â~Do The Right Thingâ(TM) unfolds showcasing the neighborhood and the people that live there. The narrator of the film is a local radio host named Mister Senor Love Daddy, played by Samuel L Jackson. His periodic commentary and his very name are interesting elements of the film. In the first few scenes a character named Radio Raheem, played by Bill Nunn, is walking down the street playing the song âFight the Powerâ? by Public Enemy. This song was created and released at the request of Spike Lee for his film, and is played several times throughout the film. The lyrics of the song portray many of the issues presented throughout the film regarding racial issues at the time. The gross disparity between the treatment of African Americans by employers, the police, and other demographics are shocking. \n\nThe main character Mookie has a son with a Hispanic woman named Tina, played by Rosie Perez. He is trying to save up money by delivering pizza and living at home so that he can help support his son. This pressure is evident in the film as there are moments where Mookie wants to quit his job due to racial discrimination expressed by Pino, but is unable to since there are no other job prospects for him. There are several characters in the neighborhood that seem to be either homeless or unemployed. In an environment such as this, Mookie puts up with a lot just to stay employed. His boss Sal does give Mookie a hard time over the course of the film, but ultimately does care for him and does not treat him in the same degrading manner his son Pino does. Pino holds strong racists sentiments against the people whom live in the neighborhood, although his father repeatedly attempts at trying to make his son see things clearer. His customers are not bad people, have never done anything wrong against him, and have support his business for many years.\n\nConflict first arises in the film when an African American character named Buggin Out, played by Giancarlo Esposito, comes into the pizzeria, starts and argument over the price of a slice of pizza, then after paying for it, sits down to eat lunch. As Buggin Out is eating his pizza he notices a wall in the restaurant that states âHall of Fameâ? with photos of famous Italian Americans posted all over it. Buggin Out has an issue with there not being any famous African American photos posted there as well. As an argument erupts, Buggin Out believes that the reason there arenâ(TM)t any African American photos on the walls is due to racism. Sal tells him that it is his restaurant and if he wants to decorate the place with Italians on the wall that is his right. The conflict continues to escalate until he is thrown out of the pizzeria and Mookie is told to go cool him down outside. Buggin Out takes the whole thing too far but is insists that Salsâ(TM) pizzeria is racists and he will start a boycott to protest this. Buggin Out goes around the neighborhood attempting to recruit other people to join his boycott, the only issue is almost everyone loves the pizza and have no issues with Sal. The film continues with examples of racial tensions between the African Americans whom have lived there for a long time and the Asian immigrants whom just opened up a shop. They view this ability for foreigners whom have just arrived into the country and speak almost no English at all as having more rights and opportunities than themselves in America. A debate ensues between a few older African American people sitting on the corner trying to figure out how it is possible that they are from this country and have spent their whole lives here, yet still have not been able to move up in society economically. They conclude it is solely because of their race. Additional examples of racial tension play out throughout the film between African Americans and Hispanics, white people, and Italians.\n\nAs tensions continue to build as the heat wave continues, one day Radio Raheem believes he is being disrespected because of his race due to the fact he was blasting his favorite and only song âFight the Powerâ? inside the pizzeria. Sal aggressively asks him to turn the music down, which only perpetuates the conflict. Radio Raheem does turn the music off in order to be served, but when asking for extra toppings he is told it will cost more; which he takes personally offensive. There is mentally ill character named Smiley whom is always trying to sell photos of Malcom X or Martin Luther King Jr to people on the street, most people treat him well in the neighborhood. One day Salâ(TM)s son Pino yells at Smiley for trying to sell his photos to him, and takes it too far, as Smiley storms off inconsolably offended by Pinoâ(TM)s words. \nCont...",

            "content": "Do The Right Thing\n\n\tIn âDo the Right Thingâ?, director, producer, and writer Spike Lee bluntly examines the complexities and interactions of both explicit and covert racism, set amidst 1980â(TM)s New York City. Framed initially as a comedy, the film follows Mookie (Spike Lee) during the hottest day of the summer, as he breezes through the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn delivering pizzas for Salâ(TM)s Pizzeria. Throughout the day, Mookie interacts with a diverse cast of characters. Leeâ(TM)s depiction of Brooklyn presents the viewer with a vibrant collage of people, differing in race, personality, age, and philosophy. Lead editor Barry Brownâ(TM)s stylistic choices and warm post-production editing create a sense of unity within this diverse community. However, bigotry begins to permute through these cracked sidewalks. By the end of the film, a man has died, and the neighbored is in chaos\n\n\tDespite the filmâ(TM)s name, Spike Lee does not present this situation in moral absolutes. Rather, the viewer is forced to grapple with the complexities of racism without a clear villain to point their eager fingers at. In this sense, Spike Lee has succeeded immensely in creating an honest and potent examination of a very uncomfortable topic. As a social critique with no clear answer, I believe âDo the Right Thingâ? was intended to serve as a conversation starter. By refusing to define the storyâ(TM)s heroes and villains, Lee presents an extremely honest depiction of racism. Rather than sugar coating the story and hand-holding audiences through the rough spots, Lee forcefully portrays the damage caused by racism through an unfiltered lens. The question of who to blame for the filmâ(TM)s tragic climax is never answered, nor was it intended to be. Rather, I believe Leeâ(TM)s true message is to warn us all that normalized racism in modern America is truly insidious, and that all of us, especially those most privileged members of society, should listen carefully to itâ(TM)s victims.\n\n\tWe see the complexities of bigotry illustrated in the filmâ(TM)s characters. For example, Sal (Danny Aiello), owner of the local pizzeria, is a caricature of a typical second generation Italian-American patriarch. At times, Sal seems to to rise above the racism implied early in the film, even referring to Mookie as a member of his family. Sal clearly cares about the members of this neighborhood, having fed so many of its inhabitants while watching them grow up. However, at times of heightened tension, Sal relies on racial slurs to express his frustration. The dichotomy of Salâ(TM)s feelings towards race is explicitly represented through his two sons, Pino and Vito. Pino (John Turturro) is not shy about his negative feelings toward black people, and allows his racial paranoia to override his sense of compassion. Vito (Richard Edson), on the other hand, is extremely friendly with Mookie, who describes him as being down for the cause when confronted for hanging out with a white person. We see both of these attitudes reflected in their father, Sal. In creating such a family dynamic, Lee highlights the extremely complicated and contradictory psychology that allows racism to flourish. \n\n\tWhen discussing the gravity of the issues presented in âDo the Right Thingâ?, its easy to forget that this movie, at itâ(TM)s core, is a comedy. However, the way Spike Lee employs his comedy is quite unlike other films within this genre, even those that attempt to tackle social issues. By depicting intimate views of each cultural microcosm within this Brooklyn neighborhood, Lee forces us to invest in his characters on an emotional level. Many of these early sequences are quite playful, and are intended to make us sympathize with each character, despite the growing air of bigotry that beings to permeate throughout the film. The comedy in the film serves to disarm the viewer, and makes us feel at ease with the world around us . This comedic tactic parallels the ways in which racism is still able to thrive in the modern United States. The comfort of the privileged and uninformed breeds complacency within a corrupted system, just as the humor in this film serves to reassure us that everything is okay. In fact, everything is not okay, and something must be done about it.",

            "content": "Doing The Right Thing confronts race relations in America. The film is set in a Brooklyn neighborhood.\n\nI found the film Doing The Right Thing to be made with great intent. Each character fit into the filmâ(TM)s plot in a meaningful way. Although most of the filmâ(TM)s cast is black, there are characters of Asian, European, and Caucasian-American descent. The ways in which this film explores the interactions between these groups speaks to the level of complexity of racial relations in America. \n\nOne feature of the film that I enjoyed very much is the use of alternative camera angles. In moments of conflict, the camera angle would lie below the character in the scene. When Da Mayor and Mother Sister interact throughout the film, the camera angle shifts 45 degrees. At the end of the film when their relationship becomes friendly, the camera angle is realigned. I found the shifting angles to be a clever way that the film expresses the instability and stability of situations. \n\nAdditional tools this film employed well were the concepts of heat and coolness. Techniques were used to make the neighborhood seem extremely hot. I found that the use of heat generators and color theory illustrated the concept of heat effectively. A way in which the concept of coolness was created was by using the fire hydrant. I like how these concepts enhanced the sense of stability and instability throughout the film. For instance, the use of the word chill in the radio hostâ(TM)s final show give a sense of stability.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this film.",

            "content": "Do the Right Thing is a 1989 American comedy-dramaÂ filmÂ produced, written, andÂ directedÂ by Spike Lee. This movie takes place on one of the hottest days of the year in Brooklyn, New York. People of all different backgrounds are captured in this film and their intense hate for each other builds up over the course of the movie and ends in violence. The movie begins with a character named Sal, who opens his pizza parlor that he has owned for over 25 years. The pizza parlor did not always have the same clientele as it now does. When the movie takes place, emphasis is placed on the neighborhoodâ(TM)s dominant African American population not always being that way. Salâ(TM)s son wants to move away from this change but Sal is too community oriented and proud to relocate his dear pizza parlor. One of his customers called Buggin Out, does not understand why there are only pictures of Italian customers on the wall and says something about it because that is not an accurate representation of the people who sit and eat there now. This sly comment blows up into violence causing everyone to say how they really feel. One of the things the director did that was very smart was to not base his movie off of a true story or how to overcome racism. Rather, he catches racism right in the moment. This made the movie different than all other movies that centered around racism at this time. \n\n\tI liked how this film was not about what is right vs. wrong and how racism is unacceptable but how it shows racism as a normal behavior. Nobody trusts anybody except the members of their own racial group and other people that look like them. Do the Right Thing has a strong historic context of issues of oppression and racism, as they had always been a huge issues and still are today. Itâ(TM)s production highlights that worked were the honing in on African Americans, Italians and Koreans and showing the audience the funny, yet offensive ways in which none of them trust each other. Is this just reflective on the individuals or the community as a whole? The social justice prevalent in this film is the depiction that racism here is just generalizations made by normal people in a normal community. How can we make these characters realize that they need to look at one another as integral parts of their community, who are equally able to work together toward common goals? Once these characters understand that, then social change will occur and the community will be able to get along better, have less judgement and work together. The characters in this film are very racist toward each other just like in the film The Great Dictator. Because of what preconceived notions were about Jewish people, the dictator and society decided to brand them as outcasts, just like the people of Brooklyn did to each other. All in their own communities! If you are struggling to adapt to biculturalism or want to watch a funny movie that draws on a real issue I would highly recommend watching Do the Right Thing.",

Overall, the movie made me feel intrigued and compelled. I enjoyed that it showed the perspective of a few different characters versus just focusing in on that of Mookie. Written by Spike Lee, I felt that his ability to seamlessly move between each character's narratives without getting us lost in the shuffle was amazing. I truly don't feel that there were any weaknesses in the script. Spike Lee, who did an amazing job, also directed the film. The performances overall were great and well casted. I particularly enjoyed that of Bill Nunn who played Radio Raheem. He possessed such a great balance of being intimidating while also being endearing. Edited by Barry Alexander Brown, my favorite sequences were between Radio Raheem and Sal. Each confrontation led into the next, feeding into their tension. As the cinematographer, Ernest R. Dickerson used light and shadowing to his advantage such as when Tina is walking through her apartment with her son, into and out of shadow. I felt that the film was overall very well done, and incredibly thought-provoking. At any point there was never a weak link, and I enjoyed it very much.",

This starts off as a bit of an urban opera/comedy that's pretty fun to watch and then the climax goes with a serious BLM tone which in this case I don't fully agree with. I do like the acting here, a lot in fact, but Spike Lee's character is so unlikeable that it's hard to root for him at all(not sure if it was his intention anyways). He's lazy, very selfish, a bit of a dick and at the end helps cause the riot by vandalizing the place he works at AND has the gall to ask for his paycheck when he was a shitty worker the entire time. It's like, are you being serious right now?! Did not agree with the so called \"protagonists\", if you can call them that when the shit started going down. Anyways, I don't want to get into a lengthy discussion on why I disagree with it all, but for me it brought what could have been a potential four star rating down to a two and a half. As I said, acting is great, first half of this is really good, but it's brought down by its shitty conclusion. That's my two cents on this.",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Our Daily Free Stream: Spike Lee - Do The Right Thing. Eine Brooklyn Reihe. - Nur ganz wenige Filme bleiben hängen! Nur ganz, ganz wenige Filme dringen wirklich ins Innerste vor! Als ich mir zum ersten Mal Do The Right Thing von Spike Lee im Videodrom auf VHS auslieh, war ich zu Tränen gerührt! Gleich zu Beginn der Filmkunstbar Fitzcarraldo stand fest: Do The Right Thing muss ab Tag 1 im Laden verfügbar sein! Spike Lee hatte für mich das Unmögliche geschafft: Ein Film über Rassismus, der Empathie zu allen seinen Figuren aufbaut. Er rattert nicht einfach die altbekannten Argumente herunter; er entscheidet sich nicht einmal für eine Seite. Lee blickt traurig auf dieses Ding, dass wir Rassismus nennen und das scheinbar so tief in jeder Gesellschaft verwurzelt ist. Vielleicht sogar im Menschen... Es waren übrigens nicht alle so hingerissen von Lees Film. 1989 las ich auch schlechte Kritiken. Vermutlich rührt das daher, dass Lee sich schlicht weigert, zu vereinfachen. Er beschreibt einen Tag in Brooklyn. Wir lernen die Nachbarschaft dort kennen. Ganz langsam, Schrittchen für Schrittchen, entwickelt sich die Tragödie aus dem Alltäglichen. Das Opfer Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) ist schuldlos. Er hört mit seinem Ghettoblaster Musik. Die Lautstärke erzürnt Sal (Danny Aiello), aber auch drei ältere schwarze Herren. Hier beginnt der Eklat... Es gibt weder \"Helden\", noch \"Bösewichter\" in Do The Right Thing. Selbst ein besonnener Polizist tritt auf, als bereits ein Mob auf der Strasse wütet und eine Pizzeria in Flammen steht. Wir erleben den Tag mit allen Beteiligten und haben jeden von ihnen kennen gelenrt. Aus diesem Grund fühlen wir niemals Wut, angesichts der Katastrophe - nur Trauer. Am Ende wird einer von ihnen tot sein und ein zweiter steht vor den Trümmern seines Ladens. Wie kam es so weit? Etwa aus dem Grund, dass in der Pizzaria nur Italiener hingen und keine Schwarzen? Oder weil es überhaupt keinen Laden mit einem schwarzen Besitzer in der Strasse gibt? Antworten werden nicht geliefert. Vielleicht gibt es sogar \"Helden\" und \"Bösewichter\", aber die werden wir an diesem Tag nicht auf den Strassen Broklyns finden. Dazu müssten wir uns viel intensiver der Geschichte der schwarze Diskriminierung zuwenden. Gestern Abend sah ich den Film wieder und war verblüfft, was er für ein stilistisches Experiment er darstellt! Lee hat aus seinem grimmigen sozialkritischem Stoff eine kraftvolle Ladung mit grellen Farben, ganz viel Humor und Musik werden lassen. Manchmal wirft er auch einfach seinen Realismus über Bord, etwa wenn der lokale DJ (der junge Samuel L. Jackson) durch die Strassen marschiert als sei er die Radiostation von Brooklyn. Und romantisch ist der Film auch! Die Szene, als Sal Jade (Joie Lee) ein Stück Pizza reicht, aber nur von ihren schönen braunen Augen schwärmt. Keiner der Charaktere in Do The Right Thing ist perfekt und genauso deshalb verstehen wir sie. Denn was sind wir schon, wenn wir nicht einmal die Gefühle einer Filmfigur verstehen? Doch nichts als Gefangene unserer selbst! Man hat Spike Lee immer als wütenden Filmemacher des New Black Cinemas beschrieben. In seiner Arbeit finde ich keine Spur davon. Vielmehr ist Lee ausgesprochen fair! Eine stille Trauer ist der Grundton dieses seines besten Films. Er endet mit den Worten Martin Luther Kings und Malcolm X. Ist Gewalt wirklich notwendig?",

It might as well have been the first time, though, because I didn't remember too much of it.\n\nI'm not saying anything new when I say that this is a classic. From what I have seen and read of Spike Lee's oeuvre(which I'll admit is not nearly enough), this seems to be the most accessible of his works. It's bold and unapologetically black, but warm and funny with a dash of heaviness to it - basically, it's a Spike Lee joint. \nThe dialogue is snappy and even-paced and the characters are memorable - I remember reading somewhere that even the heat itself seems like it s own character; in the background, always lurking and prodding the tension. I think one of my favorite things about this is that it seems like a small snapshot of a time and place and when it's over, life goes on; it was just a two hour look. At times it's like we're listening in on small-talk conversations that aren't necessarily riviting but interesting nonetheless. Sometimes I'm in the mood for movies that are driven by  \"unimportant\" talk.\n\nI was seven when this movie came out, so I don't know first hand how 'Do the Right Thing' was received. I know that it is a reaction to  the very real-life racial tensions that existed then and certainly exist now. If ever white America needed evidence that ugly racism and police brutality in the inner-city are nothing new (you may be surprised by how many people think \"this whole anti-police attitude\" is a new thing), this could be exhibit A.\nI mean, what year was this movie made? Because, it goes without saying that the last 15 minutes could have taken place in 1969 just as much as it could in 1989, just as it could (and has) in 2016.",

Lee's wonderful screenplay uses humour to temper what could otherwise have been an exhausting essay on rage and violence.  These themes are part of the package but it is the comedy and the humanity of the characters which allows us to stay with them.

Being 32 at the time of the filmâ??s release, Lee showcases his flair for opinionated talk about racial matters by crafting a vibrant screenplay that will never run out of steam, and as well as directing, producing and starring in the film, Lee deserves credit for producing a timeless story that will remain culturally significant for a very long time.\n \nDo the Right Thing is a culturally important creation that will never cease to be essential, not just for black people, but also for pretty much every race on the planet. Its investigation of living with different cultures in the same society has something to say on immigration and cultural history, but the futility of its source of racial divide speaks mouthfuls of racial dissonance. Salâ??s wall of fame in his pizzeria features only Italian-American celebrities, but the lack of black people on the wall even though black people frequent the pizzeria creates friction, and demonstrates so clearly how the outlet of divide is so pointless that its significance determines how racism infiltrates even the most banal features of society and is the cause of major problems. Do the Right Thingâ??s formidable scene of proclaiming every racial stereotype on the face of this Earth, no matter how insulting they may be, gives the film a dimension of truth that never goes beyond the boundaries of acceptability, and that gives Do the Right Thing the lease to remain a powerful depiction of racial stereotypes even a quarter of a century after its release.\n \nThe reason it hasnâ??t been forgotten is the vibrancy of its depiction that oozes originality and allows it to pack a punch. The conversations matter, no sentence lacks meaning, everything works to give Do the Right Thing a social and cultural resonance that it feels stubbornly impactful. The camerawork bolts us into this world and serves to heighten our reaction to the film, because we get up close and personal to these major problems and are allowed to understand them from an insiderâ??s perspective. This is important to Do the Right Thing, but the camerawork can be disorientating as well as unpolished, for at times the shuffling of the cameramanâ??s feet can be heard when zooming into these problems!\n \nThe supreme factor in Do the Right Thingâ??s success is its excellent cast; from the bottom to the top, everyone expands the world with reality that little bit more. The American-Italian owners of Salâ??s Famous Pizzeria are undeniably the stars of Do the Right Thing, with Danny Aiello and John Turturro giving gutsy and distinctly Italian performances. Aiello especially as Sal, the patriarch of the Frangioni household, embodies his characterâ??s life with a seamless veracity that you feel every detail of his struggle as a father trying to support his family in this culturally diverse neighbourhood. There are also great performances from Breaking Badâ??s Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) before he could intimidate, Martin Lawrence as a heightened version of himself, Bill Nunnâ??s Public Enemy loving Radio Raheem, and the late veteran actor Ossie Davis producing a clinical depiction of a friendly drunk. Everyone is so immersed into their role, this neighbourhood just breeds pure realism, and it can be pretty startling, because by the end Do the Right Thing has created a world so believable, its story and characters will stick with you long after the film finishes.\n \nThe Verdict:\n \nDo the Right Thingâ??s depiction of racial stereotypes and cultural divide remains second to none, thanks to Spike Leeâ??s bitingly opinionated viewpoint that prefers to vibrantly show us rather than school us.\n \nâ??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??        9/10",

            "content": "Do the Right Thing By Spike Lee (1989) Review  \n         \"I hate this frigging place, I detest it like a sickness.\" \n          \"I am gonna kill somebody today\" \n          These quotes were spoken by Vitto and Sal respectively in the film, and these quotes unfortunately reflects to the viewing experience of this reviewer throughout the film. Spike Lee's 1989 film \"Do the Right Thing\" was a great attempt at channelling themes of peace and violence, and the backdrop of a mostly black neighbourhood in Brooklyn with white, Hispanics and Asians in the minority provides some great social commentary on race relations in America. Unfortunately, this is where the complements end. From an entertainment perspective,\"Do the Right Thing\" suffered from a predictable and uninteresting plot progression, as well as a cast of mostly irritable, one-dimensional and unsympathetic characters, making it almost unwatchable at times for the audience.   It could be argued that perhaps the film is structured and directed to send a message to society, and that entertainment was never the priority of Spike Lee when he made the film, but this reviewer still found that the message's coherency was greatly weakened and deemed insignificant by the flaws listed earlier. In fact, this reviewer is greatly puzzled by the amount of praise and accolades received by this film when it came out, including the Academy Awards. \n          The film takes place on supposedly the hottest day in real life New York City neighbourhood, Bedford-Stuyvesant, with the heat serving as a metaphor for the racial tensions heating up in the film. The plot centred around a pizzeria named Sal's Famous Pizza, ran by Italian-American Sal and his two sons Vitto and Pino, which was the only white-run restaurant in the mostly black neighbourhood. Mookie, a young African-American played by Spike Lee himself, worked at the pizzeria as a delivery boy and could be considered the film's protagonist, can be implied as the bridge between the white community and the black community in the neighbourhood. Without getting into spoilers, the theme of racial tension is very front and centre in this film, but how the plot structure handles this theme greatly falters. The plot mainly consists of conflict after conflict after conflict, in which that the majority of the character interactions in the film consists of yelling, swearing and threats of violence, with little to no scenes of warmth or peaceful interactions throughout the film. Anger is the dominant emotion in the film, but it's so overwhelming that this reviewer could not sit through the whole film, needing to take small breaks from the ordeal.\n          \"Yo, Hold Up!, time out, y'all take a chill, you need to cool that shit out!\"\n           \"Why you got so much anger in you!\" \n          This brings up the characters in the film, and as mentioned earlier, their lack of emotional intelligence and ability to control their emotions made this film almost unwatchable at times.  This film seemed content to show a character who appeared calm and possess reason, only to toy with our expectations and quash our hopes by having the same character showing behaviour that seemed to lack any common sense and reason in the very next scene they are featured. For example, Sal was initially portrayed as a great father and store owner who seemed to possess the ability to calm down and even calm others, mitigating quarrels between his two sons Vitto and Pino, as well as taking Mookie's side when Pino berates him unfairly for not sweeping in the very beginning. However, when the trouble-maker Bugging-Out demanded to have African-Americans displayed on the restaurant's Hall of Fame, which was to be fair, unreasonable and insensitive, Sal displayed such uncontrollable rage and blood-lust that he was ready to beat Bugging-Out with his baseball bat, completely destroying his character suggested earlier. Another example would be Mookie himself, who initially seemed reasonable and likable as well, especially when he escorted Bugging-Out of the pizzeria to calm the situation. However, his likableness was again destroyed when he suggested that Vitto, who does not get along with his brother Pino, to fight him and beat him up, essentially inciting violence between the two brothers, when it was not his business to do so. Other characters such, as the aforementioned Bugging-Out, as well as Radio Raheem, the catalyst for the film's climax, are the poster child for how unlikeable the film's characters are. Some argued that rudeness is a famous part of New York culture, and that perhaps the film would be attempting to portray that authentically. However, I still believe that the amount of obnoxious is overdone and irritating. The only voice of reason throughout the whole film, ironically, was neighbourhood's drunk, called Da Mayor, who could arguably be the only likeable character throughout the whole film. Given how most characters in the film seemed to find amusement in conflict rather than seeking to avoid it, and how characters almost always made matters worse, and how they are incapable of calming down, it was inevitable that the film ended the way it did.\n          Overall, this reviewer believed that the film not only failed to entertain, but also failed to effectively tackle the issue of racial injustice and oppression, because of the unbearable plot progression, and the obnoxious, unlikable characters, which takes away from the immersion and the experience of the film, and even made the film unwatchable at times.",

It certainly feels like a film of its time and, while I am not stupid enough to think these things no longer occur, it seems like the world has changed a lot since then.  I don't like the way Spike Lee presents things, because it is overly stylized and feels like an exaggerated attempt to appear artistic.  The film bounces around from one character to another with no coherent link from one scene to the next other than the existence of these people in the same city.  I generally prefer a more cohesive narrative, but this movie wasn't built that way.  Slowly things escalate and everything explodes in one scene of intense drama, before petering out at the end.  I never connected to the material, and was thoroughly annoyed by it all instead.  Also I felt like the African-American characters were almost all presented as overloaded with negative character traits and Danny Aiello was basically the pillar of virtue through most of the film.  I just don't comprehend what the purpose of this movie is, because it seems to reinforce false stereotypes.  I'm probably not smart enough to see Spike Lee's vision, and I'm out of touch with the world at that time.  Needless to say, Do the Right Thing didn't do the right thing for me, and I would rather not watch it again to try and understand it better.",

I've seen other movies by Spike Lee and very much liked them........Jungle Fever, Malcolm X and School Daze. For some reason I never saw \"Do the Right Thing\" even though it was his most famous. Well, we went to see it this week at our local city art museum, which we are members of. A lady first gave her beliefs about the themes of the film, listing a series of attacks against Black people...the fact that one of them was the proven racist fraud of the Tawana Glenda Brawley fake rape case and the lady belonged to \"Black Lives Matter\" was a warning that this might be about race baiting. The movie is two extremes; on the one hand, it's an incredible masterpiece of directing, screenwriting and acting, a nearly perfectly made film as far as filmmaking itself was concerned. On the other hand, it was a racist, morally bankrupt and hypocritical film with the worst stereotypes of Black people ever filmed, even worse than \"Birth of a Nation\" or \"Mo Money\". Every character, except for the parts played by Ossie Davis. Danny Aiolla and Samuel Jackson (who were supporting actors only) were lazy, racist, violent thugs who had no redeeming feature at all. None of them, including the main character, \"Mookie\" (played by Spike Lee) did the right thing in any situation....except Ossie David, who played a hero town drunk. The climatic scene, a violent and terrible race riot, gave an eerie version of the Michael Brown event many years before it happened. A anti-violence quote by MLK came at the end, immediately followed by a pro-violence quote from Malcolm X, from when he was young and had views he later denounced. This was a truly evil and corrupt movie of high end quality, like Birth of a Nation and Triumph of the Will.",

A black man, radio Raheem, is killed by police in a predominately black town so they burn a pizza shop owned by a white man, Sal. But Raheem had just tried to kill Sal, and no one liked him anyway. I mean sure, it shows how willing Americans are to fight over race, but it's poorly done. It would mean so much more if Raheem were a character that people could care about. Then we would care that he died. Then we would understand the hatred of the town toward Sal and the police, while still seeing Sal's side of it.\nThe film seems to say that the town was completely irrational, but at the same time, they are supposed to be rational. Maybe I'm just missing the point. Although I don't understand why the people feel no remorse for their actions, but also leave Sal alone on the day after the incident.\nAs for the rest of the film, it's a lot of unnecessary buildup for a quick ending. There's so much character development, but the two main characters in the fight were the least developed. We know so much about everyone else, but the characters that start the main conflict are relatively mysterious.\nI'd also like to note that the film could be more accurately called \"don't do the wrong thing,\" but that just doesn't have the same impact, I guess.\n\nThe film probably worth watching, but I doubt I'll ever watch it again.",

It seems Sal and others cant even deal with what has happened in the aftermath.

The color of deep red dominates throughout the movie that represents the feeling of the people in Bedford - Stuyvesant, as it is the hottest summer day. This creates an explosive atmosphere, as can be seen from how the characters engage in aggressive confrontations, which cause the racial tension to increase and finally reaching a film's conclusion which includes a climax with violence. \n\tThe movie started out as a light and entertaining movie and then slowly become dramatic with tensions building up and it ends with a tragic climax. It can be seen how Spike is more focus on emphasizing the relationship and the tension between the characters rather than on the character themselves. Each of the character represents a certain belief, from the Buggin Out's uncontrolled anger and Radio Raheem on one side and Pino on the other side. The character Jade and Vito, who are trying to connect and live at peace with the other side, as well as Da Mayor in his isolated but peaceful state of mind, living in complete peace with the world around him, and Smiley who is living in his own isolated existence, then, the protagonist, Mookie, who is stuck in the middle, torn between his commitment and responsibilities to both sides. Finally, Mister Senor Love Daddy in half active character and half all-knowing narrator - who represents the voice of reason in the conflict, the reason which is bound to collapse. Each and every character plays an important part in the climatic and dramatic conflict to which the movie builds up, and though it's the radical ones - Buggin Out and Radio Raheem - who trigger the events that cause the tragedy, they are not necessarily the ones who finish it. It is Mookie and Sal, in fact, who ultimately play the main part.\n\tIn order to convey the racial tension between the characters, Spike Lee also uses the movement of the camera. Much of the camera's movements are rapid shot-reverse-shots, because characters are often yelling at one another throughout most of the film. The speed of the camera adds edginess to the dialogue through which the audience learns that the characters allow their personal struggles to interfere with their judgment about other races. Lastly, the camera's distance from the characters allows the audience to be more emotionally involved with the characters point of view. For example, the camera is normally close up on characters, placing the audience in the middle of the immediate action line. It increases the sense of mental and emotional stress that characters endure from dealing with one another in the heat of the moment.\n\tTwo different political philosophies by Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X ends the movie, Do The Right Thing.  Martin Luther King Jr.'s political philosophy talks about non-violence ways to achieve the final goal of peace and equality between all race, while Malcolm X talks believes in the use of violence, if necessary, to defend oneself from others, calling it \"intelligence\". From the destructions of the Pizzeria, it can be seen how Spike Lee follow a philosophy, \"an eye for an eye leaves everybody blind\", as it has saved Sal's and his son's lives. At the beginning of the film, Mister Señor Love Daddy said \"Wake up!\" and \"the forecast for today is hot!\" After the destruction of the pizzeria, Mister Señor Love Daddy repeats those two lines, which represents how nothing has changed. The biggest struggle of the society may be how they are attempting to survive the racial conflicts that they are facing. \n\tPersonally, I think that Spike Lee has successfully provided a realistic view of the race relations at the time the movie was released. It provides the viewer an understanding of the problems behind racial tensions from Caucasians and African-Americans as well as their fears and frustrations. In my opinion, Do The Right Thing is tense, difficult, and also it breaks many taboos. I believe that some people will find this movie to be some kind of offensive due to its storyline as well as the language used.  Overall, it was an entertaining and very well made film and well acted by an ensemble cast. This movie has a great message and really has some superb directing and acting. I would recommend this film to anyone interested in cinema since it is a unique work that is funny and insightful.  This is the first Spike Lee movie that I've seen.",

            "content": "How would you imagine spending a hot summer day with the thermostat boiling past a hundred degrees Fahrenheit? Director Spike Lee of the movie \"Do The Right Thing\" would believe one should watch and observe a long day in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. New York Knick fanatic Spike Lee would like for his audience to see other side of New York. Not the bright lights, big cities, and a place full of opportunity side. But the side of the urban, hip-hop originating, majority of the middle to low class African American population New York. \n\tAlthough some may visualize this movie as being too militant, confusing, or too much of a focus on the middle-class values mixed in with street smarts, but all Lee wishes to accomplish is a way to express how racism was a major central fact during the year 1989 when he was growing up. From the very start of this movie, the audience will be drawn into the energetic woman dancing to the song Fight the Power by Public Enemy, a rap crew during the late 80s and early 90s. Exemplifying that the idea of this movie is to propose a fight for blacks to have their rights the same as every other human being in Brooklyn. \nIntroducing himself as Mookie, a pizza delivery boy for Sal's Famous Pizzeria owned by the famous hard-nosed Sal and his two sons. Mookie's character was an exact replica of a young African American male trying relentlessly to make a quick dollar to support his girlfriend Gloria and son Hector. Playing his role like a true New Yorker from the heart of Brooklyn should. Wanting to \"Fight the Power\" of the racist police and even the management of Sal's Famous Pizzeria. Some of the others characters that are brought into the day are sympathetic and some are hateful. Others are the likable ones that do bad things. \"Isn't that the way it is in America today?\" quoted by Roger Ebert who feels that this movie is racially and culturally brilliant.  \nThe neighborhood itself represented the struggle of most blacks during this time period. Having no air conditioning on a hot long day was far from strange to the people that reside there. Finding anyway possible to remain cool, whether it was to open every window in the house to placing large ice cubes all over your body. This troubled low-income neighborhood gives every aspect of how life was back then. The cinematography of the film is what sets it apart from any normal movie under that category. With close shots of a character's eyes or different angles of a building or an extreme zoom in of a character shows some humor in this harshly raced film. \n With every typical thing you would see in an urban hood such as this one. There are the two stores that are not black owned, three old men who sit around in the hot sun and comment on everything that passes by them, a simple minded street person who walks around trying to sell photos of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. All things you would see if you were strolling through the ghetto. . \nThis film is hand down the most controversial movie to ever premiere. All of the reactions towards this film saying that it will cause trouble in society or it was indecisive between liberal pieties or militancy avoid the central truth of the movie, Roger Ebert said it best by claiming \"that it is reflecting the actual and current state of race relations in American than any other movie of our time.\"",

            "content": "Social commentary in the most realistic way possible, showing us how it affects a neighborhood.  Do the Right Thing (a Spike Lee joint) follows a neighborhood in the midst of racial tension who try to deal with the hottest day of the summer, and deal with an issue with a man named Buggin' Out boycotting a pizzeria named Sal's as Sal's \"Wall of Fame\" doesn't have any \"brothers\" on it.  The film came at a time when racism was getting out of control, and help was needed quickly.  Movies have seem to inspire people (even though like all inspirational media, most of it is fiction), and there's no denying the action taking place throughout.  The film also explores a neighborhood divided by racial issues, the lifestyle of the inhabitants, as well as what takes place in one particular day as the majority of the movie takes place in one day.  Another thing is the daily occurences with the lives of certain characters, and their unique nicknames and names, like \"Da Mayor\", \"Mother Sister\", \"Radio Raheem\", \"Smiley\", and \"Mookie\".  Another thing is the conflict taking place in the neighborhood, such as people playing in the streets, using the fire hydrants to cool off, soak a person's car (convertible with no roof=extra hilarity), act mean to a mentally handicapped person, tell off a couple people, act mean to anyone, arrive late to work, constantly take breaks, always take forever to deliver a pizza (Mookie has a job delivering pizza, which is the only person you see working outside the pizzeria throughout the film, and of course, rioting, which is a main issue, especially when it is caused by mistreatment of others, including the opposite race, which is the focus.  The film reveals a lot about the treatment of the two races, their possessions, their complaints, issues, and problems.  The incredible thing is, it happens over the course of one day, which is pretty incredible considering how much you can learn of the inhabitants of a neighborhood that quickly (trust me, one day is quick, even if you like to talk to others).  The huge attractions to the film are its use of music, and its opening scene, which leaves the audience surprised and pumped up for what's to come, though it is very harsh in nature and tone, especially when it explores themes of race relations, the role of media in the community (rock music and the \"Wall of Fame\"), urban crime and poverty, colorism in the black community and at time, political issues, which are Lee's main themes. And the most incredible thing of all, this was Spike Lee's second feature film after his debut She's Gotta Have It.  Spike Lee contributes as director, writer, producer, and the main star of this picture.  As writer, he uses tons of racism and language, and makes sure to highlight racism as the main theme, and also making the film as realsitic as possible rather than overstuff it with over-the-top ridiculousness than turn the viewer away, and his devotion towards writing the script earned him his first ever Oscar nod for Best Original Screenplay.  Another thing he did with the script is uses a ton of laughs and real emotion in order to make it believeable.  As director, he's no-holds-barred in capturing the everyday lives of civilians, and capturing the backdrop of a neighborhood, but he also makes sure his cast is not holding back and giving it all their might even in the most shocking and heart-breaking scenes.  Lee also offers up realistic content and interactions, as well as the popular trends of the 80s, and the most hard-to-do scenes.  This should've received him a Best Director Oscar nod, but the Academy turned him down, as well as the Best Picture Oscar as the film was a very strong contender against Born on the Fourth of July and Dead Poets Society, although the others lost to Driving Miss Daisy, a weaker contender.  I believe Do the Right Thing should've won, but anyways, let's move on to the cast.  Spike Lee is good as Mookie, a father who works at Sal's, but constantly takes a lot of breaks, and is miserable.  The supporting cast is good, including Bill Nunn as Radio Raheem, a tall man who carries a huge boom box, Giancarlo Esposito as Buggin' Out, a friend of Mookie's who wants some \"brothers\" on Sal's \"Walk of Fame\", and Rosie Perez as Tina, Mookie's foul-mouthed girlfriend who also has a son named Hector.  Another interesting thing about the film is that it marked the debuts of Martin Lawrence and Rosie Perez, Danny Aiella received an Oscar nod for his portrayal lf Sal (he was the best performance in the entire film),and that it became very controversial due to the riot at the end at Sal's pizzeria, especially due to the use of violence.  A must-see, and a warning of what happens when racism goes too far.",

The characters, even the racist ones, hate stereotypes yet they buy into them and it reveals all of those faults of races- black, white and asian- and how they subject themselves into trouble.

            "content": "About two weeks ago, I read news about the independent deaths of two black civilians, Philando Castile and Aldon Sterling, under the hands of local police forces. Soon after that, I heard about two separate incidents of lone black civilians shooting and killing multiple officers of their respective police forces. All of these stories reminded me of where I normally believe violent tendencies root from: pressurized frustration. I generally sell myself as a pacifist, and, no matter how large of a protest I may ever take part in, would never want to resort to violence for achieving my means. However, having watched Do the Right Thing in light of what has happened -- mind you, this movie is almost thirty years old -- there is something to be said about the fact that such incidents are what leads the vast majority to talking about these issues otherwise brushed to the side. Spike Lee does not want you to choose a side. He wants you to choose both sides, and, pardon this moment of exploitation, know what is the right thing to do in a given situation. He wants you to understand where everyone comes from, what each individual wants, and why particular incidents are bound to happen. Do the Right Thing is phenomenal. I have not said a word about the movie.\n\n1989!! Brooklyn, on a hot summer day. Oh, but first, Spike Lee takes the time to introduce one of hip-hop's all-time greatest songs, Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power,\" to the world in its full three-verse glory, while female dancers break it down like a revolution were about to burst through their souls. Okay, Spike(R), I am ready. Brooklyn, on a hot summer day. We see a small chunk of a neighbourhood, almost entirely black in its community. Exceptions include a favourite pizzeria named Sal's, owned by, you guessed it, an Italian-American Sal (Danny Aiello), and a grocery store owned by a recently immigrated Korean family. On the morning of this day, tensions between everybody seem normal, in that any anger is primarily released between people of the same race. This provides us with the comedic portion of the script. The relationship between Da Mayor (Ossie Davis), local old drunk, and Mother Sister (Ruby Dee), local old crazy, is very playful in how they express their resentment. The fact that the actors were married in real life might have helped. Main character Mookie (Spike Lee) and his girlfriend Tina (Rosie Perez) quarrel with one another constantly; this may come from Mookie's historically irresponsible attitude about everything -- parenting, working, loving, and, arguably, standing up for himself when appropriate. Throughout the day, we hear the optimism of the local radio host (Samuel Jackson), the stuttered soliciting of Smiley (Roger Smith), and the industrial funk of Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) and his loop of Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power.\"  Mookie works for Sal's pizzeria as a delivery boy, and during his travels around the block, he encounters these localized tropes over and over, not fully aware of the resentment building inside everyone against one another. No one except Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito), who has no qualms in confronting Sal about the lack of a single black person on the establishment's wall of fame, has any clue of what such containment can lead one to do.\n\nAs the sun goes down and the moon and artificial lights brighten the nightly streets, stakes rise higher and higher. Each race continues to confide in one another for peace, escapism, agreement, strategy. Spike Lee does not blame any particular group for that. He blames everyone, but he also forgives everyone. Biologically, we are inclined to confide in those we trust the most. Those people tend to be those that we grew up with or raised, and from there, we cling to those who look like people we grew up with. It is practically inevitable, when we are not conscious about it. That is what is so illuminating about Do the Right Thing. This is a wake-up call that has been ringing for the entire duration of the movie, but we may not even notice until huge tragedy strikes. And when it does strike, everything I love about this movie hit me at once: the humanity, the political enlightenment, the urgency, the despair, the optimism. A masterpiece of art like this is not easy to find. With all due credit to the craftsmanship of director and screenwriter Spike Lee, this may have more to do with the industry's desire to reject works like this for being too confrontational. Personally, I live for facing confrontation.",

            "content": "Remember the days when Spike Lee's \"joints\" has a real edge and potency to them? Nowadays, he's rolling out more generic, Hollywood tripe like \"Oldboy\" but there was a time when he was a highly original and passionately political filmmaker as he regularly touched upon important social issues and conflicts. However, few of his joints have been as packed or as provocative as \"Do The Right Thing\".\n\nOn a hot summer day in a Brooklyn neighbourhood, the residents struggle to keep their cool in the increasingly sweltering temperature. Sal (Danny Aiello) owns the local Italian pizzeria where he happens to upset black activist Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) who, in turn, demands the black community boycott his place. Most people are unwilling to do so but it still adds to the discontentment amongst the community as racial attitudes and prejudices begin to surface.\n\nTaking the title from Malcolm X's quote \"You've got to do the right thing\" and being inspired by an actual incident in Howard Beach, New York, Spike Lee crafts an important and unflinching portrayal of racial tension in a literal urban melting pot. He sets his intentions from the outset with the ferociously pumping music of Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\" and infuses his story with an eclectic mix of races, characters and personalities, while still managing to lend the film an important lightness of touch. It has a distinct and observant humour that magnifies the absurdity in people's preconceptions and judgments but this absurdity is soon, skilfully, shifted to frustration and rage which descends his characters into a chaotic madness.\n\nFilled with an abundance of excellent performances from Danny Aiello's hard working Sal to John Turturro as his racist son Pino and a small but highly entertaining role for Samuel L. Jackson as the radio dj, 'Mister SeÃ±or Love Daddy' - who seemingly oversees everything in the neighbourhood. Lee's direction is vibrant and colourful and makes full use of an excellent hip-hop score before other filmmakers even realised it was cool to do so. His script is also as sharp as they come with endlessly quotable dialogue and he even has the bravery to have a selection of characters - from different ethnic backgrounds - rhyme off very personal and racial slurs in a montage that breaks the fourth wall. With this scene alone, it's easy to see why some were offended by the film upon it's release. It's a passionate reflection of racism and race relations and one that raises as many questions as it answers. However, that's the whole point; Lee's agenda is not to incite trouble but to rouse debate and he does a sterling job in doing so, while still being empathetic towards each and every one of his characters - regardless of their ethnicity. That's the real key in preventing this film from being contradictory in it's arguments as many critics have claimed it to be. Few films have ever dealt with racism as powerfully or as thought provoking as Lee does here. He has a strong voice on the subject and this outstanding piece of work is one that's still as relevant today as it ever was.\n\nBeginning with a simmer before ending in a boiling intensity, this a powerful and thought provoking, sociopolitical commentary. Lee would go on to deliver the similarly themed \"Jungle Fever\" and \"Malcolm X\" after this, which cemented his reputation as one the most important black filmmaker's of our (or any) generation.\n\nMark Walker",

He even fought the police, he wasn't going to give up! The guy goes into an Italian Pizza Place and demands that they put some black people pictures on the Wall of Fame there.

Yeah, the Italian guy can do whatever the fuck he wants in HIS place! And the black guy wouldn't shut up or turn the music down in an establishment that WASN'T HIS.

The movie further pushed me to believe he is a hypocrite. The movie seems to push a  non escalation moral, yet Spike Lee tweeted the address of the home he believed was George Zimmermans, sending a mob to the house. That's certainly not the right thing. And for a man who's such a black activist it's shocking to see most the black men being portrayed as apes in the movie. It went so far as pushing me to become an Italian nationalist (I'm not Italian) because the negro mob mentality annoyed me so much. The film is all about stereotypes.\n\nThe film had one character I really liked and that was the soothing Dee-Jay, voice belonging to Samuel L. Jackson. The soundtrack is great, and through comedic elements the film kept me widely entertained. At the end before the credits there's two contrasting quotes, one by Malcolm X the other by Martin Luther King Jr. , it was a beautiful use of quotes if I've ever seen one.\n\nThere's to much I can't bear about the director, writer, and  lead actor to create a positive experience.

            "content": "Right from the start, after its nice musical introduction and then inventive opening credits, this film completely nails everything it wants to do. The setting and location are excellent chosen, it has a perfect tone, absolutely gorgeous cinematography that truly sells the heat of the day, an absolutely lighting speed pace, an excellent story, cast and script. It also just does things that I love with having everything set in one location that we really feel involved in after a while with an expansive cast of people we really feel like we've come to know in only a matter of minutes. The way everything is put together in this film is astonishing, every scenario fades into the next so smoothly, accompanied with real dialogue that you would hear in day to day conversations that and you really do feel like you're spending a full day here instead of just being told that you are. Spike Lee's craft is so good and controlled and it's amazing how good he was considering how young he was, this is the film that really put him on the map. The cast of this film is absolutely huge and it'd be foolish to name everyone and I'll just name a few, Danny Aiello, wow does that guy have range, I remember seeing him in 'Moonstruck' and going from that to this, he did an excellent job. Robert De Niro was originally offered the part, but declined because it was too much like parts he had played beforehand, and it did feel like Aiello was channelling De Niro for this. I did like his character as he wasn't the two dimensional caricature like I had expected after looking at some pictures of the film and overall, I felt like his character unjustly screwed over, but I'll get to that. I really liked Ossie Davis as Da Mayor, he was just a nice guy who really did try to help people and not cause any trouble and he also was only one of the ones who just wanted to keep the peace. Paul Benjamin, Frankie Falson and Robin Harris were excellent and had me laughing all the time, I'm so glad they were in the film more than I thought they would be and Samuel L Jackson was a lot of fun. Seeing a young and almost unrecognisable Giancarlo Esposito was fun, I think it was the hair that did it, I didn't even know it was him until the credits and the joke made at the character's expense about his hair was funny, and the Smiley character I liked a lot. We also say hello to Martin Lawrence, in his first big screen feature, and Rosie Perez in her first film. \n\nSpike Lee as Mookie was odd, at first it felt very humble and just a part he played just to fill the roll but the longer everything went on it felt the opposite. It isn't uncommon for directors to put themselves in the lead and Lee usually appears in his films in one way or another, but it didn't feel like it was done for the right reasons, and his character looses all sense of balance and reason when he incites the violence at the end. And even before then, looking back on it, his character wasn't really all that great to begin with, he slacked around, took Sal for granted and just didn't really seem to bother, you could argue it was hot, but we've all worked on hot days regardless if it was pleasant or not. What makes it even worse is that right at the end he acts like nothing happened and/or he clearly doesn't seem to care about everything that happened the night before to Sal's place, which was pretty much his fault. And then after causing all the violence, during the night before, it cuts to him sitting on the edge of the pavement with a, 'how could this have happened', look, even though, once again, it was his fault. Then again, what can Sal do? Shout about it? That isn't going to bring anything back. I also find it hard to sympathise with people who go into other peoples' workspace and berate them for not doing something that they want, why couldn't he just sit down calmly and talk about it? As well as someone who intentionally turned their music up right before walking into the building. While it isn't nice for anyone to have done to them what happened at the end, even if I only think he was unconscious, it's hard to feel much sympathy for a character that was rude to everyone and mostly unpleasant to begin with, and when someone is resisting so much what are you supposed to do? Sal was also hugely provoked and only did wrong by a piece of equipment as opposed to a person, like he very well could have done, I see Sal as the most unjustly accused and the biggest victim in all of this.\n\nThe ending of the film is built up very much throughout the film and is indeed very hard to watch, the child that is drawing with chalk that we see throughout the film just symbolised to me the loss of innocence that happens when we get older. I thought everything would have erupted after those two almost got run over but no... Something much different happened. The film had a very powerful message and it calls out everyone watching, the ending quotations especially. I only had a few other nitpicks, I thought this might have been my copy that I downloaded via Sky Go, it wasn't but it was more noticeable on Sky Go, but at around 1 hour and 11 minutes the sound just got really quiet all of a sudden; it makes sense from the scene before it to naturally sound quiet and it makes sense for the scene as well, but it's just something to note. Soon after that, in something I doubt is related, there is a scene where Spike Lee and Rosie Perez kiss and when they do, a few seconds later it just cuts to before they kiss so they can do it again, for some reason. There was also a part where everyone just looks straight into the camera and just says insults, and while funny to just see these characters just go off on a rant just to see how long they can keep it going, it felt out of place as the scene after just carries on like usual. There is a POV shot used later on and that actually made sense and fit well. And we are told there is a drought and yet people play with the fire hydrant anyway. This film was virtually perfect until I started to think about and notice a few things around 1 hour and 11 minutes and even with those, I know I'm nitpicking, but hey. 'Do the Right Thing' is, overall, a very smoothly directed and controlled film, where Spike Lee demonstrates his skills absolutely perfectly and it's another film off of the list.",

Spike makes it clear to us that there is a failure to communicate between races and that this leads to misunderstanding.  The movie itself captures all of the ridiculous and albeit terribly racist stereotypes in a hilarious way.  Mookie, although he's black is still friendly and connected to everyone who lives in the neighborhood.  He doesn't have anything against anyone.  The movie itself is a springboard for action.  It calls everyone who watches to do something about the injustice, violence, and racism that is occurring to everyone not just african americans.  Even the title calls for action.  And yet it doesn't offer a solution.  It lets you make your own decision.  Which is quite frankly the most brilliant part of it all.  You have to choose what to do with it.  Just do something.

            "content": "Quick explanation: Starting now, I will no longer write 5,000-character reviews for movies that nobody cares about, because they tend to not get read, and it's a waste of my time. Instead, I will write one-to-two-paragraph long blurbs and post them as my reviews. If you want them expanded upon, please comment, and I will then write a full review for them. As always, recent movies that are still in theaters or came out this year will get full reviews.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty much universally accepted that movies reflect a lot about what a group, culture, or nation is going through at the time that the movie was made. Godzilla reflected the Japanese's fears of nuclear bombs, and their humiliation at losing WWII. Star Wars was a happy, straightforward, black-and-white movie with moral absolutes that made a welcome distraction from the war and poverty at the time. And just as these movies are perfect time capsules of the way we were then, Do The Right Thing is a time capsule of the way were were in the 1990s-- and unfortunately, still are. The one difference: Those movies didn't hit you in the face with their message until you were knocked unconscious.\r\n\r\nSpike Lee's Do The Right Thing, which he directs and stars in, is the story of racial tension in a small Brooklyn community on a hot summer day. This is a movie that asks a lot of its audience, forcing them to think (but not too much) and putting them through a dialogue-driven movie in which every character is all but incomprehensible. The stereotypes in this movie are surprisingly uncreative, with Korean grocery store owners who speak in thick accents, Italian pizza-makers who yell \"BIPPITY BOOPITY BOO!\" and black guys with afros who carry boom boxes around. I didn't expect it to be this stereotyped, but it works, as the movie definitely exposes some truths about racial tension.\r\n\r\nSadly though, the film takes a turn for the worse towards the end, where the main character Mookie (Spike Lee himself) initiates a riot against the aforementioned Italian pizzeria owners. We've supposedly been rooting for this character for the whole movie, and suddenly the character goes through a complete turnaround that makes him simultaneously unrealistic and unlikable. It's not very good. Not to mention that half of the characters are annoying, sometimes intentionally and sometimes not. Mookie's girlfriend, a high-pitched, shrill Mexican girl is so fucking obnoxious I wanted to scream.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Do The Right Thing: 6/10 stars. It's good but not great (as some people say). Although it's well-done, the thing it's trying to isn't very admirable. Sure, it's trying to expose truths about racial tension in mixed ghettos, but much like this year's Elysium, it spends way too much time establishing how important it is to the world instead of actually trying to convey its message. It's not that it's bad, but it insults the audience's intelligence by repeatedly drilling into our minds its bland and obvious message. It's a great premise that was thwarted by a sloppy and lazy execution. I wish it had been done better.",

Cool music, cool scenes and amazing casting in this film. The Mookie character is acted out by Spike himself, that is pretty cool. Samuel L. Jackson as a DJ is also a worthy character. Several other big names are involved here, many of them early on in their careers.\n\nit starts of light and are constantly evolving, it works darn smooth since it's superbly written and there are no down points here. Entertaining, interesting and very powerful. The theme with people and different races seem to to be a sure winner. A big film that still continues to grow, it was probably not as interesting or fascinating in 1989, maybe it was a bit more relevant, but it still is today. I guess it will continue to climb the ladder of important and good films. Highly debateable film with loads of details and character characteristics with a complete wrap up.\n\n8.5 out of 10 doctors.",

This film shows the same story from different points of view and it felt very honest by making the point that even though all the characters went into the situation with the best of intentions their personal flaws and obsession make them turn to despicable acts, to the point that the only voice of reason is the character that seemed to be the most flawed from the start.",

            "content": "Worst. Film. Of. All. Time. \n\nPure and simple. First off, there's this guy named Sal who's Italian and lives in a prominent Black neighborhood. He's nice to everyone in the neighborhood and has a wall of fame that has people who have inflicted HIS life. However, some thugs say that they don't like him or his pizzeria because he has no black people on his wall of fame. Now, this is SAL'S restaurant and his property and he can decide what he wants to do with it. Now, one if these thugs decides to blast music inside the restaurant, disrupting and annoying everyone. Throughout the whole film, Sal is nice to EVERYONE and tries to do his best despite the fact that everyone treats him badly. But, Sal has had enough and smashes the thug's radio. The thug then tries to strangle Sal, but police get involved and accidentally kill the thug. Then, a riot starts which results in the restaurant burning down due to Mookie's ( the main character) anger. Please note that Mookie has been a lazy employee of Sal's and slacks off any chance he gets. And then, in the end, Sal is sitting in his burnt pizzeria. And then, when this good hearted man is down and hurting after having his business that he built twenty years go gone, Mookie comes back and asks for his paycheck. \n\nThis delivery man who has slacked off and instigated a riot that left dollars in property damage now has the nerve to kick this man while he's down and ask for his monthly paycheck. Honestly, if I were Sal, there would've been a body in the remains of the pizzeria.\n\nNow, this movie is made by Spike Lee, a so-called great filmmaker. Now, we all know Quinten Tarantino, the director of Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained. In an interview, Spike Lee criticized Tarantino for the amount of N words in the film. Django only has the N word some 55 times whilst Do The Right Thing has the N word an uncountable amount of times. \n\nHowever, going back to my original thesis, this film is not bad because of it's camera angles, though I and my brother dislike them ( we are amateur filmmakers, writers, and directors). But the writing and directing are the worst of this film. \n\nNow, getting back to my original point as to why this film is horrible. The film is called Do The Right Thing. Only one character does this. That character is Sal. Sal does the right thing by treating everyone fairly ( as it says in the bible) and by trying to set his own example of influential people. Spike Lee has done this film horribly wrong and strayed away from the true point. He has glorified the villain (Mookie) and made the hero ( Sal) as the bad guy. However, I must commend Spike Lee for his ingenuity. But the one thing that bothers me is that if someone else (such as Tarantino) had made a film that tackled race such as this, it would've been met with scorn and been scrutinized many a time for it. But, since an African-American man made this film, it is met with praise for successfully representing the African-American neighborhoods in New York City. \n\nNow, this is my opinion and mine alone. I am allowing you to make your own decision. You can view the film and can decide whatever you wish upon it. I would also like to point out that I have not grown up in a bad neighborhood so I do not know what an African-American neighborhood is like. But, this is from what I've heard from my father ( a  high-ranking policeman) about those types of neighborhoods. This is only my opinion, so form whatever you may about the film.",

All the characters ( except Mayor) you come to love and know just go completely crazy and act like wild animals. The street corner guys are lighting the pizza place on fire, and mother sister is yelling burn the place don, and then there is Mookie. I had already had trouble liking him as a protagonist because you begin to see his darker side, but then he completely just betrays Sal, who was like a father to him. I feel like as a viewer you are burned in the end, as all along Pino was right, Mookie would stab them in the back. I do not like how the movie just changed so drastically in the matter if two minutes, as after Raheem's death, it's like you are watching a whole other movie.

Just as a movie, it's pretty flawless.  It's setting is simple, but extremely vibrant with a ton of personality in both its structures and its characters.  The whole world is bright, colorful, and loud, capturing a distinct personality to the street the characters dwell on.  The characters are plentiful, but they are distinct, and mostly memorable.  The writing feels realistic with enough themes and wit to keep it going.  As a presentation of this world, it's pretty much perfect.\nIn its themes however, things get a little more complicated.  Spike Lee is very clearly trying to make a statement on race relations, but not as effectively as he maybe could have.  For example, in a key moment of the film one of the characters is killed in an act of police brutality, but I didn't really care.  Not because the character was black, but because the character was an asshole.  It's debatable whether anyone in this movie ever actually does the right thing.  It shows the violence and angst that can rise in race relations, but offers so very little hope on the matter.\nI don't know, I'm really mixed on this.  Should I praise it for providing a real and grim look at these themes?  Or slam it for providing no clear solutions, sympathy, or hope for the problems it presents?  I bounced around a lot with the star rating here, more than ever before.  In the end, I must give it praise for its merits as a film, and for its potential in providing discussion.  But it should be discussed, because while the film on its own provides a great jumping off point for debate and discussion, it doesn't give any of the answers on its own.  That's not necessarily a bad thing though, even if it is a little frustrating.",

            "content": "Do The Right Thing is a cultural phenomenon since it serves as a paradigm of not only Spike Lee's work, but a look at the underside of American life when stuck in the harder part of it and being treated as such a different person for the mere purpose of skin colour through the perspectives of various characters, and Spike Lee's excellent work leads me to define it as his answer to Reservoir Dogs.\nSpike Lee is the perfect director for Do the Right Thing because his strong political beliefs are played into motion throughout the film which proves controversial and internally conflicting to the viewer since many actions may conflict with the values of the viewer, but Spike Lee ensures there's a fair perspective to both sides of the story. He does this by creating a series of clever characters with values that come into contact with their actions which are significantly more vigilant in the area they are in since the only source of power comes from prejudice police officers or the Italian man on the block and his popular pizza shop. \nIt's a complicated story with characters that seem to constantly be all over the place with a lot of dynamics which are occasionally troublesome to keep up with, but it's ultimately a clever one with a finely written script and strong characters which all can be attributed to director, writer and actor Spike Lee who is truly at his finest in Do the Right Thing.\nThe cinematography is terrific all throughout the film because of the various angles it takes form a somewhat rebellious feel to the story which fits in with the plot dynamics and music, and therefore establishes a feel in the atmosphere which equates with the lyrics of the song being constantly played wherever Radio Raheem goes entitled \"Fight the power\". Do the Right Thing is utterly rich and atmospheric, and that's what makes it a story that functions and flows smoothly even as it charters into rough territory.\nAnd the top-notch cast is what makes the characters worth sympathising with or conflicting with, but either way they're characters the audience develop an interesting connection with.\nThe standout is Danny Aiello as Sal, since the power his character has as the owner of a popular pizzeria is something that intimidates characters and gives a sense of futility, but the fact is his character is friendly in his own way and so interpreting him is conflicting to the viewer until the climax when things are resolved, and Danny Aiello's fine performance keeps the ball rolling and keeps the viewers entertained with his antics and what his character symbolises, and so the product relies on a skillet performance which Danny Aiello manages without hesitation.\nSpike Lee also captures his character well and since he knows the intended direction of the story, he takes us there well with a charismatic performance.\nOssie Davis was also great since his physicality was good to characterise the town drunk, but he provided a grand sense of wisdom to his character and developed fine chemistry with Ruby Dee who was also good.\nAnd in earlier roles, Rosie Perez delivers fine sass, Samuel. L Jackson used his voice to advantage to provide soul to the voice of the neighbourhood and John Tuturro took advantage of his ability to play an aggressive character and used it well.\nMartin Lawrence was also strong and Bill Nunn provided a great atmosphere because his physical characteristics seem to be reminiscent of Muhammed Ali whose legacy has a similar political stance to characters in the story, and his performance is great.\n\nIm a consensus, Do the Right Thing is a challenging and complicated drama film which is a little much at times and is packed to the brim with question upon question which may mesmerise the viewers as they attempt to answer them, but it's undeniably well crafted, cleverly written, powerfully acted and successful in delivering its message, and features impeccable handling of racism.",

The slice-of-life mosaic of characters and moods throughout most of the movie is interesting and often fun. There's a lot of great dialogue here, and I doubt anyone would fail to be moved to passion by the ending, whether to anger or to catharsis. I personally felt angry with the way the movie handled the fate of the white characters. I read somewhere that black audiences were said not to ever question Mookie's inciting the riot, thus not valuing \"white property against a black man's life.\" Are those the only alternatives? I'm not sure whether it was intentional, but Lee's Buggin' Out and Radio Raheem are seriously obnoxious characters. When Sal finally busts up the radio, I was like, finally someone shuts that dude up. Is it racist then to demand some civility from one's customers? And then in the midst of this, when Sal breaks and starts spewing n-words, the whole group in the pizzeria is outraged. But surely, when one is extremely angry, insulting the other person is par for the course, and what better way to insult someone than a racial epithet? Does that mean he hates all blacks? Is the mere saying of a word in the heat of passion evidence of prejudice? Surely there's nothing to call a white person that's as demeaning as the n-word, but blacks will, in a rage, refer to a white person as a cracker, whiteboy, or honky. And all this, after Sal expresses his affection to the people in the neighborhood to his overtly racist son Pino. I'm sure if I was Sal in that climactic scene, I probably would have slipped, too, despite my usual composure. Is that part of the commentary., then? That whites are, deep down, savage racists, despite all our civil rights gains? Are Sal and his sons oppressors in the neighborhood? It certainly doesn't look like it, though Pino seems like a jerk. I could go on in like manner. That a movie can provoke this many questions, and such strong reactions, certainly recommends it.",

I didn't grow up in the burroughs of New York City, something I think you may have needed to have done to understand this film to its full extent, but I do know that hatred and racism, are things learned by people, usually by people unsure of themselves and not happy with where they live and their surroundings. Do The Right Thing contradicts itself many times over and over, by preaching love, tolerance and understanding then displaying anger, racism, violence and a lack of respect for those around you. The final scene in fact concretes a stereotype of black people, that no matter what you do for them, they will blame you and only believe in their own selfish forthright agenda.

I think Danny Aiello's Best Supporting Oscar nod was very well deserved, as he played Sal with an extreme amount of emotional honesty.   The acting was great from Aiello, John Turturro as his racist son, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee and others.  Sam Jackson and Martin Lawrence make appearances too.  See it for yourself and decide. The closing of the film is probably the most important part of the whole film, with 2 quotes: one coming from Dr. King and the other from Malcolm X, which completely sum up the divergent approaches to the civil rights issue, and race issues in general, which are just as important today as they were 20+ yrs ago.",

Of course Danny Aiello and his sons are effective as the more abrasive and culturally ignorant pizza goons. There is just something so calculated into making a statement here that I think it takes away from the honesty or legitimacy if it wasn't so obvious.

A movie that defines the racial drama. A movie that defines a hollywood ending. A movie that defines cinematography. Everything in Do The Right Thing is amazing. The movie opens up with our radio host saying its the hottest day of the year. It is hot. HOT HOT HOT! Mookie works at a pizza parlor getting his regular salary. When things start getting damn choatic in the ghetto, Mookie watches. The movie has excellent cinematography. The way they used the colour orange with the camera makes us look at how hot is really is outside. The screenplay is oscar worthy at all costs. Why wasn't this nominated for Best PIcture? It was only nominated for two actors. Screenplay (Original) and Supporting Actor. But Danny Aiello gets top billing! I love many scenes like the risky racial cussing scene where some of the cast talks to the camera and swears out racial words. I love the koreans and their market also. The DJ was awesome, Radio Raheem was awesome, Mookie was awesome. Everything was awesome. The ending. My god. What a ending. The ending is supported at the middle where a man tries to boycott Sal's pizza parlor. This happens at the end of the film with Sal breaking Raheem's boom box and getting into a fight with him. Raheem is killed by the police. Everyone watches in shock as they take him away in the police going downtown. Mookie, being sensible grabs a garbage can and throws it at the window of Sal's pizza parlor. Everything goes crazy. They start trashing the place and burning the place as the police arrive just in time to stop this riot as the koreans watch and Mother Sister mourns the fall of the commuinity. Then, the final scene. Where Mookie goes to get his salary. He walks away and then we get quotes from Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom X as they are mentioned in the film. The film ends dedicating people and the credits role. Do The Right Thing is more then just a movie. Its Doing The Right Thing.\n\n97/100 A",

No one respects anyone else, which then dovetails into violence shattering the peace of the street.  Director Spike Lee is bold and brash, but unrefined here, seemingly more intent on the message than the story.  There seems, though, to be no real backstory for these people to behave they way they do.  Who has the right to demand anything of someone else, especially when the demander does not own an establishment they want changed?  That seems to be the the entire genesis of the film.  Yes,  there are racial problems and issues, but this isn't a black/white/Asian/whatever movie.  It's a respect movie.  I think Lee misses that point.",

            "content": "Do the Right Thing is Spike Lee's best film and an incredible example of race relations.  There was one specific scene that I loved in this film.  Its a scene where Spike Lee and john Turturro are talking and Lee is asking him why he hates black people so much.  Turturro claims his favorite basketball player is Magic Johnson and his favorite rock star is Prince, and Turturro doesn't see them as black people and Lee suspects he secretly wishes he was black.  This escalates into an argument and they show different points of view of racism by different men talking into the camera and saying what they say about the opposite races.  I really found that to be powerful and an incredible example of racial sterotypes.  Spike Lee has directed, written, and starred in this flawless piece of film making and a great vision of racial tensions, living in a world of prejudice, and how even in a small neighborhood like this, racism still lives.  All these different characters show different personalities and different kinds of colors, and theyt each add different kinds of themes and ideas about racism.  The racial tension rises in the film until the climatic ending which ends in violence and tragedy.  Some of the characters feel oppressed by white men, and it leads them to hate the white man in general no matter what.  It also shows how serious police brutality is and how it can cause racial tensions even with the authorities.  The performances were incredible, Spike Lee and John Turturro were great, but its Danny Aiello that stands out and shows his truly great acting.    His scene where he argues with Radio Raheem and Buggin' Out is one of the most intense scenes I have seen in a film, and Lee directed the speciifc scene perfectly.  This film is called a classic and one of the best films of the 80's, I personally consider it to be one of the most well directed and smartest films I have ever seen.",

When it comes to the subject of race relations in America, no film comes close to tackling the subject in such a profound, confrontational, disturbing, and even tragic manner as this film does.  How this film wasn't nominated nor won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1989 is beyond me.  Well, actually it's not surprising.  It was too ahead of it's time and too shocking and daring for the ho-hum Academy (hence why Driving Miss Daisy won).  In a year full of landmark, great films (Born on the Fourth of July, My Left Foot, Field of Dreams, Batman, The Little Mermaid, Glory, etc.) this film stood head and shoulders above them.  Heck it stands head and shoulders of just about every American film that came out in the 1980's.  The ending is one of the most jaw-dropping and breath-taking endings ever for a film that really doesn't paint anyone or any racial group as being wrong.  The violence and tragedy that ensues is ultimately caused by everyone and their distrust in one another, which is part of the brilliant message of the film.  No matter what racial group we belong to, no matter what country we're from, we're all human beings and we all are flawed.  No one is any better or any worse than anyone, and without respect, trust, and understanding we can and will all destroy one another.  What an amazing film.",

It was ground-breaking and, I believe, what the movie \"Crash\" seriously wishes it were. That said, I'm not fond of Mookie's choice in the end. \n\nYes, of course the police used excessive force and killed Radio Raheem. That's where the anger should have been directed, not the men whom Radio Raheem was beating up and choking. But let's back up to what started the unnecessary nonsense in the first place: two absolute morons-- Radio Raheem and Buggin' Out-- and a special guy start some major crap over a wall of pictures in an Italian restaurant. They are upset because Sal's Famous Pizzeria has nothing but photos of famous American-Italians on the wall and no black people. I agreed with Mookie's sister, Jade, that their outrage and energies could have been directed towards a more positive and meaningful direction instead of something that ultimately amounts to nothing. No black photos in an Italian restaurant. Okay. There are more important things to worry about. Your anger and fighting resulted in what? A burned-down pizzeria, a death, and an arrest? \n\nIn that sense I think Mookie set the wrong example in initiating the attack on Sal's place. He was just as bad as his most ignorant coworker, Pino. Perhaps to Mookie the pizzeria was a symbol of \"the establishment\", those in power who felt they couldn't be touched. I also think the choice did little to get rid of the idea that disgruntled blacks in modern times know how to do little else than riot and destroy stuff in our *own* neighborhoods when there is an injustice. I guess I was really looking for him to be the voice of reason amidst all the people searching for someone to blame but he was not. I don't consider myself a complete pacifist but I don't believe Mookie did the \"right thing\" in this context. Your friend is a dead because he raised a stink over an essentially non-issue, your neighborhood pizzeria is burned to the ground, and the cop who is responsible for your friend's death doesn't have to answer for it because you've satiated your rage by destroying a \"symbol\" rather than going after the system itself. \"Fighting the power\" is not burning down a pizza place. \n\nSince the movie evoked such a strong response from me I would say it did its job although I think Lee would probably disagree with my assessment of the ending. I would recommend it for any film buff. May I also say that the unfortunate image of Rosie Perez's scary boobs will be forever burned in my brain. *shudder*",

            "content": "**** out of ****\r\n\r\nIt's the hottest day of the summer in an all-black neighborhood somewhere in Brooklyn. Residents search for beer in a blazing wasteland of heat, while others simply unscrew the fire hydrant and let the cold goodness flow out into the streets like uncontrollable rapids. In the middle of it all, the neighborhood shops have opened come morning; and both their employees and their respective owners have returned yet again for another hard day on the job, this one being a particularly difficult one to endure. And it's not just because of the heat. There is a small convenience store run by an Asian family, and then there is an Italian pizzeria, run by, as one would expect, an Italian family. The founder is a cruel, sadistic, and burly man named Sal (Danny Aiello). He operates the parlor with his two sons - Vito (Richard Edson) and Pino (John Turturro) - and a young African American man named Mookie, who is the delivery boy. Sal is ruthless, and there are pizzas to be delivered: but from the get-go, \"Do the Right Thing\" seems to be asking the question of whether the severe weather conditions can or will truly get to the city folk of the condensed hood that they inhabit.\r\n\r\nMookie's a good kid. He stays out of trouble, has a genuinely healthy circle of friends, and makes time for his girlfriend (Rosie Perez) and his sister (Joile Lee) when he can; sometimes when he's on the job. This proves to be a trade-off, as for all the time he spends delivering a single pizza to a friend or family member's house (or not), he must return to the pizzeria only to receive a verbal beating from his boss. Indeed, the neighborhood is presented with a \"it's a small world after all\" type vibe, and there are many characters, but most of the more important events happen right at the pizzeria. Being a mostly black/Latino neighborhood, this side of Brooklyn does house many Italians; and this angers Sal and his sons alike. He seems to hate a lot of his customers (particularly a guy who walks around with a loud beat box, and another who demands better-quality pizza as well as more black men featured on the pictorial \"wall of fame\" that is located in the joint), and it comes to no surprise that they hate him just as much. But alas, there are some kindly souls located in this neighborhood; like the mayor (Ossie Davis), who walks about town searching a cold one and attempting to romance an old woman named Mother Sister (Rubie Dee). \r\n\r\nSpike Lee produced, wrote, directed, and starred (as Mookie). He wanted to make a film that dove deep into the racist underworld of modern America, the kind that most Hollywood filmmakers were certainly afraid to explore at the time that the film was released. But of course, Lee has a voice and he uses it fearlessly; bringing up some truly provocative points and succeeding in gritty message-making by the time the characters (and the weather conditions) reach their boiling point. You may already know that the film ends with a tragic riot, in which an angry customer, the beat box guy, and some loyal black followers try to boycott the pizzeria; which ends in an eruption of racist violence and social misunderstanding. The film seems to be intended as a document of the many things that Lee saw in his life leading up to his directorial debut; in regards to the racism of our time. He's made a film that certainly proves that a more post-modern Ku Klux Klan need not wear the attire; for it's the man that makes the racist bastard, not his clothes.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its deeply provocative themes; \"Do the Right Thing\" is not truly depressing until the last thirty minutes or so. Until then, it does well to immerse us in the culture of the hood through music (Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\" is playing in my head as we speak) and an honest visual representation of life in a black Brooklyn neighborhood. These aren't some of the nicest people out there for sure, yet Lee is able to make us care for a good number of them; especially a lonely but lively radio talk show host named Mister Senor Love Daddy, played by a young and very much enthusiastic Samuel L. Jackson. Now, in any other film, this character might have served as a simple diversion; but here, he seems to be the only one who understands the current situation and how to maturely cope with it. Yes, it's hot out, and yes, there is racial tension going on outside his studio, but he doesn't let it get to him. He knows how to deal with tragedy and keep on trucking.\r\n\r\nThe film concludes with two quotations. One is by Martin Luther King, dealing with whether violence can ever be truly justified; and another by Malcolm X, which asks if there is a difference between violence and self-defense. Spike Lee and \"Do the Right Thing\" both seem to live by such philosophies, and that's what makes the film such a thought-provoking and important work. Yes, racism has been dealt with before in cinema; but it's a movie like this that makes me believe that past discrimination can perhaps be made up for with art. There is a beautifully written scene where several characters very colorfully scream prejudice remarks at the camera, perhaps hoping to evoke a response of some sort. Or maybe it's just meant to display anger, I don't know. But what I do know is that Spike Lee is a filmmaker to watch, and \"Do the Right Thing\" is a great movie about the topic of racist prejudice. That's the truth, Ruth.",

            "content": "Do the Right Thing is an exercise in style over substance, of adrenalin and bravado trumping plot and realism, of a message beaten into submission through sheer weight of numbers.\r\n\r\nThe opening scene is basically a music video, one that has nothing to do with the film aside from setting the tone.\r\nThat does not mean that Do the Right Thing is somehow not an important movie, far from it. It is an at times psychedelic headf*ck, a mish-mash of random movement and broadly drawn caricatures of various generations, backgrounds and ethnicities.\r\n\r\nAs we are told all too many times the film takes place on an especially hot day in New York as a bright colourful array of broadly drawn characters go about their everyday business. For many that's simply hanging on street corners commenting on passers by, for the homeless man known as the Mayor (Ossie Davis) that means cadging enough cash to buy a beer, for various shop keepers that means running a business where the clientele openly resent them - or at least their background.\r\n\r\nMost notably this includes Sal's pizzeria where the aforementioned Sal (Danny Aiello), his two sons Vito (Richard Edson) and Pino (John Turturro), and delivery boy Mookie (Spike Lee). (As something to do with nothing our family dog is named Mookie, though not for this film, for ex-Atlanta Hawks PG Mookie Blaylock.)\r\n\r\nAs the day progresses and the temperature soars the normally barely convivial relationships between neighbours and acquaintances fray, with tempers simmering in the heat.\r\nIt seems that people of every ethnicity have issues with those of other races and religions, and that on this particular day hiding these resentments and opinions is not high on the priorities list.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of all this is Sal's, a pizzeria in a predominantly black community with a black clientele that proudly hangs numerous pictures of Italian-Americans on its walls. Son Pino openly resents both his situation and customers, Mookie wants to hold onto his job but is constantly having his patience tested by Pino's poking and prodding, and Sal is proud of his business and standing in the community, and seems to genuinely not see things as being defined by colour or race.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of subplots and peripheral characters in Do the Right Thing who serve little other purpose but to show the extent of the melting pot, to keep the blood pumping and the film moving at 100 mph, eventually though many of these characters converge on Sal's at almost the same time, and the tense interactions and stress of the day all come to a head.\r\n\r\nI won't betray the ending of the film here, especially given that it is really the only major plot development in a film which up to that point was all build up putting several characters on an inevitable collision course.\r\n\r\nThe film is exceptionally edited to remain in perpetual motion, a blur of vivid colour, profane dialogue and loud conversations and rants peppered with casual (and sometimes inferred) racism.\r\n\r\nDanny Aiello and John Turturro both have very brave performances, and I say that realising that 'brave' is a descriptor used all too frequently in film, but here it couldn't be more apt.\r\n\r\nEqually brave and amazing is the writing and directing job done by Knick fan #1, Mr Spike Lee, here still a scrawny chicken legged kid, and realistically one who some twenty years later has still not topped this film.\r\n\r\nI wonder if two decades on Spike/Mookie would make the same decisions and take the same actions if faced with a similar situation he did in 1989. Actually my main hope is that the casual racism and resentment has somewhat abated from the levels shown in this film, and far more clumsy lesser films such as Crash.\r\n\r\nAnd if you have to have one song played about 237 times in a film, I'm just glad it was Public Enemy's 'Fight the Power', and not a million other crappy songs.\r\n\r\nFinal Rating - 8.5 / 10. Do the Right Thing might not be the most subtle film to deal with the topic, unfortunately it might be the most honest.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com for over 800 reviews and plenty more good stuff...",

            "content": "To all criticism of this great film, I'm going to say it up front: Spike Lee is allergic to B.S.\n\nI keep hearing how some people dislike this film because the characters are so contradictory. Because Mookie didn't do the right thing. Because the moral of this tale is unclear on whether violence is okay or not. And so on and so forth...\n\nIn \"Remember the Titans\", based on a true story, we have a team of football players overcoming their racial differences and becoming the best of friends. It never happened. In \"Missippi Burning\", based on a true story, we have white FBI agents hunting down the men who murdered three civil rights activists. In reality, the FBI barely investigated those murders at all. Spike Lee's best film is different because it takes an approach the above films don't.\n\nRather than portray race relations how they idealistically should be, he simply portrays race relations as they simply are.\n\nNo final commentary. No moral. Just characters expressing their different points of view.\n\nAnyone who's ever had a racist grandma knows just how contradictory racism can be. One minute, she bakes the best peanut butter cookies in the world; the next, she says she's going to stab your black girlfriend with a kitchen knife. Yes, it is completely reasonable for a man like Sal on a hot day to want to bust a black man's head in with a baseball bat one minute, then flirt with a black woman the next minute. It's completely believable for a man like Pino to throw ethnic slurs around like he's trying to bring them back, and yet have an affinity for black entertainers. It's completely realistic for Mookie to want to get paid at the end of the day, and throw a trashcan through the window of the same place he works at.\n\nThe entire film is an exercise in alternative character interpretation. That's what makes it fascinating upon repeat viewings. Did Mookie throw the trashcan to save Sal's and his sons' lives, or to vent his rage over Radio Raheem's death? Why did one police officer not realize he was killing Radio when his partner was outright shouting at him to let off? Was Sal really a kindly old man who loved the community, or was his excessive use of that baseball bat proof of an underlying racist tension? Why, throughout the entire film, did not one person do the right thing? What exactly was the right thing to do anyway?\n\nIn the end, this film accomplishes what all great films do:\nIt makes you think!",

I recently read a revisionist review upon the release of the 20th Anniversary Edition, with the reviewer directly challenging the perceived reputation of the film.  He thought that Sal was 'doing the right thing' by insisting that if his African-American customers wanted photos of their heroes (& she-roes) on his wall, they should get their own business and do so.  I think even Spike Lee was probably down with that sentiment.  That's one of the most useful things to take away from the movie.  The way everything else went down, it's a modern tragedy.  Still one of Spike's best movies.",
