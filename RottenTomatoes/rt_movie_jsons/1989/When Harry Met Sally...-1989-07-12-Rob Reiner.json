    "summary": "In 1977, college graduates Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) and Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) share a contentious car ride from Chicago to New York, during which they argue about whether men and women can ever truly be strictly platonic friends. Ten years later, Harry and Sally meet again at a bookstore, and in the company of their respective best friends, Jess (Bruno Kirby) and Marie (Carrie Fisher), attempt to stay friends without sex becoming an issue between them.",

            "content": "This 1989 classic romantic comedy-drama film directed by Rob Reiner follows the title characters from the time they meet in Chicago just before sharing a cross-country drive, through twelve years of chance encounters in New York City. The chemistry between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan defines this movie in its attempt to resolve questions along the lines of \"Can men and women ever just be friends?\" and Nora Ephron's screenplay shines with its dialogues that can be funny and smart without any problem. It might seem like a very ordinary film now, but it set standards for a romantic comedy to be good in its time. It is wonderfully entertaining and pretty straightforward.",

            "content": "In 1977, Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) and Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) graduate from the University of Chicago. Harry is dating Sally's friend Amanda Reese, leading to Harry and Sally ride-sharing to New York City. Sally is attending journalism school there and Harry has a job waiting. During the drive, Harry and Sally discuss their differing ideas about relationships; Sally disagrees with Harry's assertion that men and women cannot be friends as, \"the sex part gets in the way\". They stop at a diner, and when Harry tells Sally she is very attractive, she angrily accuses him of making a pass. They part company in New York, never intending to see each other again. Five years later in 1982, Harry and Sally find themselves on the same flight. Sally is dating Harry's neighbor Joe, and Harry is engaged to Helen, which surprises Sally, as it seems uncharacteristically optimistic of him. Harry suggests they become friends, forcing him to qualify his previous position about the impossibility of male-female friendships. They separate, concluding that they will not be friends. Five years later in 1987, Harry and Sally run into each other at a bookstore. They have coffee and talk about their previous relationships; Sally and Joe broke up and Helen left Harry for another man. They agree to pursue a friendship and have late-night phone conversations, go to dinner, and spend time together discussing their love-lives...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critics consensus reads, \"Rob Reiner's touching, funny film set a new standard for romantic comedies, and he was ably abetted by the sharp interplay between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.\" The film led Roger Ebert to call Reiner \"one of Hollywood's very best directors of comedy\", and said the film was \"most conventional, in terms of structure and the way it fulfills our expectations. But what makes it special, apart from the Ephron screenplay, is the chemistry between Crystal and Ryan.\" In a review for The New York Times, Caryn James called When Harry Met Sally... an \"often funny but amazingly hollow film\" that \"romanticized lives of intelligent, successful, neurotic New Yorkers\"; James characterized it as \"the sitcom version of a Woody Allen film, full of amusing lines and scenes, all infused with an uncomfortable sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\". Rita Kempley of The Washington Post praised Meg Ryan as the \"summer's Melanie Griffith \u2013 a honey-haired blonde who finally finds a showcase for her sheer exuberance. Neither naif nor vamp, she's a woman from a pen of a woman, not some Cinderella of a Working Girl.\" Mike Clark of USA Today gave the film three out of four stars, writing, \"Crystal is funny enough to keep Ryan from all-out stealing the film. She, though, is smashing in an eye-opening performance, another tribute to Reiner's flair with actors.\" David Ansen provided one of the rare negative reviews of the film for Newsweek. He criticized the casting of Crystal, \"Not surprisingly he handles the comedy superbly, but he's too cool and self-protective an actor to work as a romantic leading man\", and felt that as a film, \"of wonderful parts, it doesn't quite add up\".\n\nHonestly, I can\u00b4t remember if have seen \"When Harry Met Sally\", but now I have and what might have been a great romcom in 1989, doesn\u00b4t necessarily still be a great romcom in 2023. I personally don\u00b4t like Billy Crystal\u00a8s character Harry Burns, which is an annoying know it all sexist that never seize to stop talking, while while Meg Ryan\u00b4s character is more balanced despite her flaws and issues. They simply don\u00b4t fit together in my point of view. And their prolonged relation that goes from not liking eachother to friends to a couple has a way too long transport stretch. I love Meg Ryan back then, she has such a great natural way of acting and she was adorable in 1989. However, I think the best scene is the orgasm one at the Katz's Delicatessen in Manhattan. Hands down. The rest is not that exciting in my book. \n\nTrivia: The film was released to critical acclaim. Ephron received a British Academy Film Award, an Oscar nomination, and a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for her screenplay. The film is ranked 23rd on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs list of the top comedy films in American cinema and number 60 on Bravo's \"100 Funniest Movies\".",

But when fate brings them back together five years later, they are forced to deal with how they feel about each other.\n\nOnce in a while you click on a movie and you immediately know that you are going to love every single second of it and ever since this movie started with some jazz music, I exactly knew I was going to absolutely love this movie. I genuinely think the before trilogy had some inspiration from this movie, because they feel a lot like each other, but still significant different from one other. This movie features one of my favorite chemistries in any movie ever, Billy Crystal is absolutely amazing, however Meg Ryan gives one of my favorite performances of all time, she is magnificent in this movie and her hair is absolutely stealing the show! The screenplay is absolutely perfect in everyway, the callbacks to the beginning of the movie, the clever one liners and the emotional punches. This is one of my favorite romances in any movie to date, the way that a friendship becomes an inevitable love, was portrayed perfectly. This movie is one I will rewatch a lot of times and got added to my yearly Christmas season movie marathon, that ending as well!!!",

Surprise surprise when it turns out that this Rob Reiner classic actually has meat on the bone, a rom-com with charm and wit that relies entirely on character development and a will they/won't they dynamic by making you care about these characters, gradually stripping away reservations and pretension to straddle the line between friends and lovers. \n\nThe structure itself is relatively conventional and the comedy has shades of Woody Allen in its romantic relationships punctuated by dry humor, but Ryan and Crystal deliver a wonderful chemistry that makes the film feel original and alive instead of just a couple of familiar A-listers pretending to like each other for two hours. There's a sense of real investment as you get to witness two characters struggle with modern problems and go from mild disdain to internal conflict to genuine affection over a tight runtime that feels like it actually does justice to the decade-plus that the film takes on. Though the gag of highlighting moments in the development of their relationship with screaming in public places while others look on in shock gets a bit repetitive, and these two basically never seem to have to go to work, When Harry Met Sally seems to have been an actual bar-raiser for the genre, with actual features to its characters, cleverness to its dialogue, and a candid, endearing delivery from both leads. This one has aged well. \n\nI wouldn't want the wagon-wheel table either. (3.5/5)",

Sometimes gaining context may take awhile but it never fails to disappoint when the moment occurs.\n\nI definitely enjoyed this film where the dialogue shines and found Meg Ryan to be an absolute delight. There is not much meat to this plot which is also quite unoriginal and predictable at its core but can act as a further credit to the performances, presentation, and script which makes this story stand out among so many others like it. 7.5/10\n\n*Should note I recently watched Scenes from a Marriage (2021) and hard to match the punch felt in that five episode acting clinic, which will make even the best 90 minute rom com seem shallow and hollow by comparison.",

They did get off to a rocky start as him spitting grape seeds was unnecessarily rude but the entire rest of the movie was awesome. The fact that to my eyes Meg put on an incredibly versatile and effective acting performance that has only rarely been matched by anyone else is actually rather troubling as she got nowhere near the awards recognition that I would've thought she deserved, leading me to believe that I may not be evaluating acting performances correctly. Perhaps it's because of the genre, or the extremely well-written character giving her a boost, but it's one of the best female acting performances I've ever seen and internally I'm going to hold it in very high regard. Anyway, the music was excellent and really lent to the tone of the movie, Crystal's jokes were solid and the end result was satisfying if mildly unrealistic. I shy away from a perfect score here only because there was probably room for some more tearjerking!",

            "content": "An amusing relationship growing over the years.\n\nRob Reiner's romance comedy When Harry Met Sally (1989) is a charming film wherein Reiner shows a casual encounter turn into a lifelong friendship, then grows into a real relationship. Reiner's direction is so interesting as he doesn't shoot sweeping romantic sequencing, but opts for earnest and intimate spaces that harness genuine conversations. Nora Ephron's script is a wonderful of realistic dialogue that asks the audience what kind of people should be in relationships together. She writes funny jokes that keep you laughing throughout When Harry Met Sally's brief 96 minute length. This film goes by so fast that you'll never realize you just watched an entire couple's love story blossom sincerely by the end. When Harry Met Sally is that rare romance comedy with charming characters, funny jokes, and grounded romance.\n\nBilly Crystal is hilarious in When Harry Met Sally as a sardonic nihilist named Harry, who finds mockery and sarcasm is the key to any woman's heart. He is perfectly cast as the obnoxious know-it-all, who thinks he has love all figured out for everywhere around him only to find out he never really understood it himself. Crystal bears such a confident swagger that he's instantly likable and funny. He never feels actually sleazy or annoying in When Harry Met Sally, so that you still relate to him as he struggles to admit to himself whom he truly loves. When Harry Met Sally is easily Billy Crystal's best acting and funniest film. Crystal is a treasure to cinema and a pleasure to watch here.\n\nMeg Ryan is outstanding as the sympathetic hopeless romantic Sally. She is so witty, playful, and snarky as the obsessive and insecure Sally that you genuinely like her as a person. I found Sally even more relatable and empathetic than Harry as her character is desperately trying to be loved, instead of finding validation for herself through her own confidence. Ryan is so effortless here as Sally that she exudes a distinct allure of earnest romantic desire that makes her feel all the more human. She bounces off of Crystal's manic energy and goofy ideas so well that the two make for one of cinema's sweetest couples in When Harry Met Sally.\n\nNotably, I think Harry and Sally are meant to be together because they represent the most important part of any relationship, which is to respect one another. They listen to each other, feel their pain, share their joy, express their opinions, and ultimately respect their partner's opinions and values. They only improve and support each other, instead of drag each other down. When Harry Met Sally is so successful because of Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan's natural chemistry, genuine charisma, and vibrant humor together.\n\nAdditionally, Carrie Fisher is delightful as the desperate friend of Sally's named Marie, who acts so casually with Bruno Kirby's fussy, yet supporting Jess. Lisa Jane Persky is fun as Sally's pushy friend Alice, who is so nosey and direct. The supporting cast is simply a nice touch of well rounded characters to fill up When Harry Met Sally with positivity and complexity.\n\nIn all, Rob Reiner lures you in with slick direction featuring regular conversations and intimate moments all with Nora Ephron's fantastic writing. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan bring Harry and Sally to life with undeniable charm and tender affection that is highly nuanced. I really liked When Harry Met Sally and it's such a cute movie that I feel I will revisit often.",

            "content": "In the minds of most modern viewers this is the definitive romantic comedy because as much as It Happened One Night (1934) and The Lady Eve (1941) pioneered the tropes we all known and love this updated them all successfully to produce a thoroughly entertaining film. It's charms are undeniable as Nora Ephron, a legendary scribe of the genre, writes a witty, heartbreakingly romantic screenplay and Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal have a powerful chemistry that embeds them in the hearts and minds of audiences. I happen to love romantic comedies and so I count this film among my favorites but even those more resistant to the genre will find a lot to enjoy in a film that excels on every level.\n\nUptight, Type A personality Sally Albright, Meg Ryan, drives Harry Burns, Billy Crystal, who is dating one of her best friends from the University of Chicago to New York City in 1977. The two argue over many issues on the drive as Burns believes that men and women cannot be friends because men want to have sex with all women and Albright is unromantic in her beliefs on the ending of Casablanca (1942). They part ways once they reach the city but reencounter one another several years later at a bookstore and strike up a proper friendship as Burns has divorced his wife and Albright has left her boyfriend because she wanted to have a family and he did not. They support one another over the years even as they worry about beginning a romantic relationship as they struggle in other parts of their lives. After they have sex they come to believe that they can't continue with their friendship but deeper feelings may rise to the surface that force them to admit that they are soul mates.\n\nEphron could be accused of borrowing from the Woody Allen playbook liberally as we see two neurotic, New York based people deny their feelings in a serio-comedy but she puts her own unique spin on a story that could have felt too cynical in Allen's hands. One of the best things about this film which surprisingly few romantic films are able to capture is the perspective of both the man and the woman in the relationship. Sure, they are broad stereotypes with the men being constantly horny and the women clingy but deeper truths are revealed as time goes on with the importance of leaning on male friends after divorce and the struggle of wanting children in your thirties. Ryan gets the balance between drama and comedy perfectly in a monologue in which she explains the moment she decided she wanted to have children and the crushing disappointment of realizing her boyfriend didn't want them. Many women will be able to relate to this moment as many men will be able to relate to the fear of commitment that Burns holds.\n\nWe really get to know these characters and unlike most films the mid section of this film is it's most enjoyable part as we have had these two seemingly opposing personalities set up and now see them content with one another. Their prickly rapport shifts into tender conversations over the telephone as they watch films late at night and awkward conversations at dinner parties. We establish that they make one another better human beings and see them actually doing the sort of thing that people in relationships do like rolling out new rugs and going out to social events at which they are not necessarily comfortable. One of the saddest montages ever featured in a romantic comedy shows Albright trudging around having to do the things she had enjoyed with Burns alone as he desperately attempts to contact her over the phone. We understand how painful it is for these characters to be alone after having delighted in their shared company for so long and this makes it all the more joyful when they are united at the end of the film.\n\nAs for the performances few actresses could have done quite as much with part as Ryan does with her sharp wit and comedic timing being put to good use. She is sweet and likable without ever feeling like the annoying woman-child presented in so many films and we never doubt that she has the smarts to contend with the men who so often hurt her. Crystal is equally wonderful as he brings a touch of melancholy to the character that another leading man from the era wouldn't have. No, he's not entirely convincing as a womanizer but he endears himself to female audiences with his intelligence and humor in a way that few romantic leads have. \n\nA masterpiece that has aged spectacularly well there is a reason why this film is considered one of the greatest of all time.",

The film stars Meg Ryan as Sally Albright and Billy Crystal as Harry Burns.\n\nThe story wasn't anything groundbreaking or spectacular, but it was defiantly very engaging and entertaining.\n\nThe cast featuring Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby I found all gave very strong performances; from Billy Crystal's charming and charismatic performance to Meg Ryan's memorable portrayal of Sally Albright.\n\nThe characters, in my opinion, were the best aspect of the film. From the realistic and comedic characters to the great chemistry between Harry and Sally.\n\nThe comedy like with most Rob Reiner films was witty and clever, and had me laughing both at and with the characters.\n\nThe pacing of the film was surprisingly really good, especially in the first and third act.\n\nThe film I personally found to be very enjoyable, especially once Sally and Harry become friends.\n\nOverall give it a\n7/10 - would recommend",

            "content": "AFI 100 Comedies. AFI 100 Passions. AFI 10 Top 10. AFI 100 Quotes. AFI 100 Songs.\n\n\"When Harry Met Sally\" is easily one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time. It is short in duration, it is extremely watchable, Nora Ephron's script is hilarious, and Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan both give fantastic performances. There is very little to dislike about this movie if you are looking for entertainment. However, this is in no means an artsy film or a game-changer, but simply something that will definitely put you in a good mood.\n\nWhen Harry met Sally\u2026 they hated each other. Their actual meeting for the first time was nothing special at all: Harry's girlfriend at the start of the movie was a friend of Sally's, and Sally was simply driving Harry back to New York from college because she lived in New York as well. It only takes a couple of minutes into their journey to New York to make it apparent that the script will be full of philosophical discussion between the two of them (as well as other characters) just like most Richard Linklater films. It is an interesting notion that the main point of Harry's initial discussion with Sally is that the two of them can never be friends because the \"sex stuff\" always gets in the way of a man and a woman \u2013 yet 10 years after they meet, they become \"just friends\" (but do we really believe that?).\n\nThere is a very creative scene in the movie about two thirds of the way through where a friend of Harry's and a friend of Sally's are now a couple, and they are each talking on the phone simultaneously with Harry and Sally respectively. Really interesting editing is applied here to get all four characters on the screen at once, each taking up about a fourth of the screen. It is three separate images, the first image being an image of the couple in bed, and the other two being superimposed images of Harry and Sally on opposite ends of the screen while they are each on the phone. It is one of the most creative scenes in Rob Reiner's filmography.\n\nAbove everything else, \"When Harry Met Sally\" has a lot of heart, which comes in different forms. It has heart due to its sense of humor, it has heart by showing a lot of emotion between Harry and Sally later in the film, and every now and then, the movie cuts to different couples explaining how they met and when they knew they were meant to be together, putting a smile on the audience member's face. It is also a joy to watch Harry and Sally grow as people as they become friends (which is against Harry's initial beliefs) and as they realize their feelings for each other, even if they do not admit those feelings immediately. From the famous \"I'll have what she's having\" moment to the finale at midnight on New Year's Eve, \"When Harry Met Sally\" is a triumph of a motion picture, capturing our hearts and holding on throughout.\n\n\"When Harry Met Sally\" might not be a masterpiece in terms of technicality (it is pretty simply shot and edited aside from that creative scene mentioned above), but it is a film many should experience just for how enjoyable it is. It is a great love story and highly re-watchable.\n\n9/10",

(Spoiler Alert)\n\nIt is clear that these two title characters are meant to be together, but it takes them a long time to figure it out. It's actually great to see the awkwardness around their first meeting and how that grows into a good friendship.\n\nThe influence of this movie is abundantly clear when you can see how many times the diner scene has been reenacted in commercials, other movies, television shows, and comedy sketches.\n\nMaybe, I'm just a hopeless romantic but this story has always spoken to me. I've seen it dozens of times and I never tire of watching it. If I'm flipping through channels on the television and it is on, I will always stop, drop what I am doing, and watch it. There are very few movies that have that pull on me. I also have it on DVD so I can watch it whenever I choose to. And that's why this is my favourite movie of all time.\n\nHere's a great piece of dialogue about marriage and the possibility of divorce.\n\nHarry: \"Right now everything is great, everyone is happy, everyone is in love and that is wonderful. But you gotta know that sooner or later you're gonna be screaming at each other about who's gonna get this dish. This eight dollar dish will cost you a thousand dollars in phone calls to the legal firm of That's Mine, This Is Yours.\"\n\nMarie: \"Harry.\"\n\nHarry: \"Please, Jess, Marie.

This stupid, wagon wheel, Roy Rogers, garage sale COFFEE TABLE.\"\n\nJess: \"I thought you liked it?\"\n\nHarry: \"I was being nice!\"\n\nHow can you not love that? If you haven't seen this film, you're missing out. I highly recommend it and I'm sure, that for me, it will hold the Best Movie Ever title for another twenty years.",

It's honest, and from that wellspring of openness between Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan), love is born.  Ryan is at her charming best, she steals the movie.  Rob Reiner checks off a list of landmark NYC filming locations.  The stories of actual couples (presented by actors) interspersed between chapters adds welcome comedic gravitas.  But it's the genuine chemistry between the two leads that elevates it to classic rom-com territory.  \n\nI saw it in the theatre in 1989 (way younger than appropriate), and it set the bar. It's insights are now common place, but it was fresh at the time. And although its hipness has aged, it's heart has not. I have heard it derided as a Woody Allen movie without Woody Allen.  And that's a bad thing?  It's funny, witty and endearing.  Like the instantly classic scene where Sally proves a point to Harry over lunch, 'I'll have what she's having.'",

The dialogue, memorable quotes, flawless acting and directing, as well as the sparkling chemistry between two unlikely actors, When Harry Met Sally is a near-perfect story of two opposites who, over time, grow to realize just how compatible they really are. It's a hopeful friends-to-lovers progression that never seems forced. Rob Reiner adapts Nora Ephron's script and edits it to flawless execution. At no point does the connection seem unnatural. The audience is carried end-to-end and experiences the same maturity through Harry and Sally's relationship, recognizing the imperfections of each character and recognizing elements of each's life in their own lives.

These movies could write themselves after a while but in fairness to Reiner, when he conceived of When Harry Met Sally, the template wasn't quite so set in stone.

The film is FULL of great lines, the first sentence of this review being one of them. The best compliment I could give this film is sometimes magic comes together and just makes you want to watch a film 10 times. I'll call this the Princess Bride factor. This film is a 10 on the Princess Bride factor.  I could go on and on but the simple fact is, just watch the movie. You'll love it or your money back. \nP.S. The soundtrack is GREAT.

Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are terrific in this, and they really work well together. The conversations that they have with each other are interesting, and relatable as it talks about relationships thanks to a well written script by Nora Ephron.

The genre is a popular one, but it seems that audiences are only drawn to them so strongly due to stories that sacrifice realistic situations and characters for ideal ones. Love is a very fantastical thing, after all. Thankfully, Rob Reiner doesn't succumb to this with When Harry Met Sally: the result is a beautiful little film that stands as a solid entry in the genre without finding the need to deliver unrealistic ideas. Reiner and screenwriter Nora Ephron deliver a story that, in a way, is semi-autobiographical, drawing from their own personal thoughts on love and relationships based on their past life experiences. These ideas are what make Harry and Sally such compelling and realistic characters: they're as close to real life as movie characters can get. It helps that Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan give their all in their performances, and share wonderful chemistry with one another. These are two characters whose ups and downs over the course of 12 years are relatable and understandable, and Crystal and Ryan are the life force behind this relationship. This is one of the quintessential romantic comedies for good reason, because it's one of the most earnest and heartfelt ones out there.",

He makes the argument that men and women can never be \"just friends\", to which she begs to differ.  You get to see how their friendship progresses through the years, and who ultimately ends up being right.  According to my wife, this was my biggest blind spot in film.  While I may not wholly agree with that sentiment (I (blasphemously) still have yet to see Rocky), I am ecstatic that I took the time to watch this, because this plays to everything I like about the romantic comedy, as well as just comedy in general.  This film is like an excellent Woody Allen movie without all of the cynical self-deprecation, which makes it a refreshing breath of fresh air.  It truly is uproariously funny, and I know I'm 26 years late, but it has been a long while since I've had such a great time with a comedy.  This is directed by Rob Reiner, and I have to say, I don't think he gets enough credit as being the brilliant comedy director that he really is.  Between this, The Princess Bride and Spinal Tap, he has made classics that have stood the test of time.  The script here is bulletproof, and the chemistry is fiery; even though these two characters are constantly butting heads, you can tell at every single turn that there is something more, brewing just underneath the surface.  It's blunt vs. neurotic, and the repartee that these two share makes the movie; there is a quick-witted comeback for every line of dialogue, and When Harry Met Sally fully encapsulates how you can be attracted to somebody who is constantly driving you up the wall.  This is the quintessential romance movie, and I can't think of a movie out there that does the romantic comedy better.  It raises a ton of great points about relationship, and it forces you to ask yourself the question \"can men and women really be just friends?\"  I believe the answer to this question is no when both parties are single, but it doesn't force any sort of agenda, it allows you to make up your own mind.  There are some really good make-up effects here as well, and you can totally buy both of them as college students as well as people in their mid-30's.  There's so much about this that works, and it's hard not to emphatically fall in love with it, much like how the characters interact within the film.",

Instead of presenting a couples meet-cute as the end-all, be-all of their relationship, it treats it merely as a wonderful anecdote. The truth of romance isn't the perfect, magical moments we tell at dinner parties, but is the endurance of the commitment and love. Reiner proves this through transcendently great characters and a unique series real-life vignettes of couples telling their own stories. That interest in familiar sincerity gives us a rom-com that's both honestly romantic and truly comedic, never sacrificing one for the other.\nIt's a ten-year journey of two people who hate each other, become friends, and inevitably but unintentionally fall in love; the kind of comedy Woody Allen could've made if he weren't so cynically self-obsessed. Ryan and Crystal get past their own professional limitations, stepping into their titular roles with endless likability. Their magnetic radiance helps sell every ever-changing aspect of their relationship. \nBut the script is the star here. The dialogue sweeps you up, having the bounce of old screwball-fare, but with a more naturalistic touch. Moments like \"I'll have what she's having\" have become so ubiquitous, we forget how perfect they really are. \nBest of all, it manages to present the western stereotypes of men and women, while never defending them as absolute truth. Reiner and writer Nora Ephron use those stereotypes, certainly, but not as exact sciences so much as comedic tools, before upending them wherever possible. \nThis was at the pinnacle of Reiner's filmmaking streak, having a flawless knack for picking great scripts, and When Harry Met Sally\u00e2\u00a6 is arguably his crowning achievement.",

But then I would say most romantic comedies have in one way or another hinted at this, so credit to Nora Ephron for just saying it. Men and women can't just be friends.\n\nThat's a conversation starter for sure, but remember this movie exists in a Hollywood rom-com world. Cute people living cool lives with cool friends in their cool Manhattan Apartments, where it's nearly always fall or winter (the cities most photogenic seasons), and Harry Connick, Jr. provides the soundtrack.\n\nSo sure, you can go head and debate that statement if you like, but always remember where it came from. Then realize that if a friendship between a member of the opposite sex turns into something else, that's just life, and not confirmation of any point this film throws out for entertainment value.\n\nThat being understood, I think When Harry Met Sally is a great romantic comedy. Rob Reiner and Nora Ephron present a beautifully structured, fun and occasionally moving story and Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan have great chemistry, and devilishly good comic timing. I did find some parts a little slow, but when the big key moments come, they are hysterical.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIt has to be said, this film definitely has a 'Woody Allen' feel about it. The neurotic characters, the Manhattan setting and all the relationship babble. So if you have enjoyed his work, I think you'll enjoy this too. I think Woody Allen's film's offer more scripted nuance, but When Harry Met Sally benefits from two great comedic talents. All respect to Mr. Allen - but I've always felt he shouldn't star in his own movies.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThe City of Manhattan looks great, but this film is all about the dialog, so it will work on any device you care to watch it on.\n\nBest Moment:\n\nI know what you're thinking - the restaurant orgasm scene! Even if you've never seen the movie, I'm sure you've still heard about this scene. While that is one of the funniest moments in the movie, I'm going to pick out another moment I found hilarious. When Harry tells Sally men and women can't be friends.\n\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/when-harry-met-sally-1989/\n\nhttp://facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://twitter.com/talkiegazette",

For Americans, it became an idealized view of themselves similar to \"It Happened One Night.\" Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are New Yorkers who meet and become friends then spend the next twelve years apart, spanning the length of the movie, until finally falling in love. This is another romance where it's obvious to everyone in the audience, except the lovers, that they should be together. Nora Ephron wrote the script, which has fresh, insightful observations on relationships and perceptive, quick-witted dialogue, but is devoid of life outside the romantic entanglements. Crystal and Ryan have good chemistry and effortless timing, but their roles lack complexity and emotional depth. Crystal is unsentimental and minimizes his shtick though he is essentially playing a less neurotic Woody Allen, while Ryan is adorably kooky and at her most appealing. (She would subsequently play a variation on the role in a succession of bland performances.) Rob Reiner's enervated direction is highly derivative of Woody Allen in a manner that undermines the material. There is a classic scene where Meg Ryan simulates an orgasm in a diner followed by a memorable punch line by the director's mother. Selected for preservation by the National Film Registry. Music is by Marc Shaiman and Harry Connick, Jr. Cinematography by Barry Sonnenfeld. With Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby.",

It definitely has a very strong Nora Ephron feel to the dialogue as well because they include so much observational humor and banter in that way you expect to find in her movies. I think my issues come more in the moments when this film needs to transition into a romance. Perhaps it is merely the fact that I don't believe there is much chemistry between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan. Both of them can be great actors on their own, but when you try and have them kiss romantically it feels so off. I feel as awkward as Harry does after they've slept together. I'm not sure why, but I just don't feel that connection. The slow development of their relationship from enemies to friends is totally believable and I am always loving the film through the first two acts. Then in the final act I start to get agitated and want to stop watching.\n\nPerhaps where I continually find myself getting frustrated with this movie is the fact that Harry posits that a guy and a girl cannot be just friends. It's a difficult argument to swallow, but he makes it quite compelling. Then over the course of the film we start to see that perhaps Harry is wrong and it can be done. They have an amazing relationship as friends, and it is so much fun to watch them connecting on that level. Then the movie makes a turn and all I can say is \"Wait, so the message of this movie is that Harry was in fact right and men and women can't be friends?!\" It is supposed to be the romantic high point and I'm sitting there in frustration over the strange mixed message of the movie. I realize this is over-analyzing, or nit-picking a light romantic comedy film, but I'm merely trying to articulate where this movie falls short for me. Again, When Harry Met Sally has a lot of very funny moments. I love the opening sequence when they first meet and argue during the entire road trip, and also love the split-screen moment when they are both watching Casablanca together over the phone. I'm not sure there is any way they could have made this movie one that would work for me without making significant changes to the story they were trying to tell, and apparently I'm in the minority because a lot of people love this film. I'll watch it again from time to time if I catch it on TV, but it will never be one that I love.",

I don't get that often with romantic comedies which is why I've always been more on the side of sappy and generic like a Nicholas Sparks novel.\n.The film opens with the two strangers, both newly graduated from the University of Chicago, share a car trip from Chicago to New York, where they are both going to make their way. During the trip, they discuss aspects of their characters and their lives, eventually deciding it is impossible for men and women to be \"just friends.\" They arrive in New York and go their separate ways.\nI actually just found out that Meg Ryan was actually with Tom Hanks(I haven't seen the film in a while so I needed a refresher) but with knowing that this would actually make this my second favorite Meg Ryan as for romantic comedy I don't know. I really do like Meg Ryan's and Billy Crystal's portrayal of these two individuals they just both played of each other so well.\nThe humor is very subtle and just doesn't pop out like it would in most comedies in modern time. The film takes it's time with its humor by allowing the audience to get to know it's characters with each scene there in together and then delivers the funny stuff.\nI'm not much of a comedy with my romance person but I did love this picture I'm giving When Harry Met Sally a five out of five..",

Let us examine the success of the tropes, in the case of When Harry Met Sally: our two lead characters, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, live detailed, individual lives, the comic relief sidekicks, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby, milk Nora Ephron's deliciously charming script for all of its cartoonish effect, director Rob Reiner saddles such antics back into a movie deeply rooted in reality, and, good grief, this is both romantic AND comedic. In the reinforcement of the film's theme as to how good of friends a man and woman can be without sex, Crystal and Ryan play off one another like the best of friends would in everyday life. That feels like love to me. Even the \"misunderstanding,\" the bane of most romantic comedies in that they stab pacing straight in the back, moves the plot in a manner that indicates not another case of miscommunication, but a fundamental misunderstanding of oneself. Absolutely magical. The accusations that Rob Reiner merely ripped off Woody Allen are envious and inaccurate excuses for how Reiner actually managed to define the modern romantic comedy: We have grown sick of the saccharine garbage, but that does not mean we have to be cynical about love.",

            "content": "At one point in everyone's life, they are able to show some sort of soft spot for films like these. When Harry Met Sally is the film that stand out against it's competitors and was able to stick with me with multiple viewings. I adore this film and the film was able to draw out certain emotions from me, which is rare in romantic comedies, that it blinds me from watching this film objectively. This is a prime example of a film that defines the genre it belongs to.\n\nNora Ephron is regarded by some as the greatest writer for romantic-comedy/drama films. I have not seen all of her films but so far I hold When Harry Met Sally as her magnum opus. Ephron has written a story that explores the concept of friendship between man and woman, the role of sex in relationships, and the basic construct of a man and a woman. The film examines the role of fate in love, showing that people self sabotages or be in situations that destroys relationships in order to be with the love of their life at the end of the story. I enjoy that Ephron indulges on the opposite polarity between the lead characters, just the small banters between both and the opinions or beliefs of these characters clashing is amazing to watch. The film's story doesn't bore me at any moment because Ephron doesn't add anything that isn't necessary, each conversation between the leads allows these characters to grow and understand one another. The choice of having New York was a great choice as it allowed the theme of fated love to be much more effective. The film also contains small stories from random couples telling their stories of how they met and fell in love which just adds on in projecting the themes of the film. Dialogue in this film is a stand out because it's what drives the characters in this film, because neither characters have any strong intentions to be with the other for the bulk of the film. The dialogue, and also the strength of the actors, deliver the comedy of the film and it gets me every time because it felt natural and was also able to come off as sweet and endearing.\n\nRob Reiner, from his first feature film \"This is Spinal Tap\" and to \"A Few Good Men\", has made a string of very well made films and sometimes it's hard to choose which one is his best of the bunch. Personally this is my favorite as he has truly created a film that defined or created a new style of the genre, and also it's story has resonated with me ever since I have seen it the first time when I was 15. Reiner wanted the film to be very optimistic, which made it so accessible, and he has made something that is so natural and relatable. The film can appeal to people searching for love, allowing us to understand or think that there is a much larger work going on in finding it, or to people who have already found it. Reiner did not allow the film to really show the other people that Harry or Sally have dated and how these people are not for them, instead the director just has these characters talk to each other about it allowing the film to spend more time with these characters together. The film has the ability to have us be attached to these characters. I love that the film takes it's time with the characters', allowing them to grow and allow us to see the growth of the maturity of the relationship/friendship and the personal maturity of these characters. I was very glad that Reiner didn't congest the film in humor and allowed it to feel organic instead, like it could come out of our own mouths too. I also adore that the film's humor is driven more by the characters and the conversations that takes place rather than the story or the use of physical humor, aside from the diner scene. The film, even in multiple viewings, doesn't lose it's genuine touch which is why it is one of my favorite films of all time.\n\nBarry Sonnenfeld as the director of photography for the film was a good choice by Reiner. Sonnenfeld was able to connect with Reiner's vision for the film capturing the relationship between these characters through a long period of time with such accessibility and optimism. Sonnenfeld wants shots to be a bit stretched out in order to get the most out of the scene and allowing the actors to feel more natural and not just act in service to the story. Because the film is focused more on it's characters rather than the environment they are in, preventing the film from feeling like flashy and pretty though at times there are a few beautiful wide shots of New York like on the winter and autumn seasons.\n\nThe film is soundtrack driven rather than a score driven film and I thought this was a great decision because Reiner chose songs that keep in tone with one another and the tone of the film. The songs are usually big band type of songs which was able to project a sort of class that other films lack. This though has made a big impact on future films/TV shows set in New York.\n\nMeg Ryan and Billy Crystal demonstrated amazing chemistry as they both look and play roles that clearly show in paper that they are meant to be together. Both actors deliver their lines so naturally that certain moments can allow us to really relate to conversations and events in our own lives. Crystal's humor may not appeal to everyone but in my opinion it really worked here, he wasn't too over the top and instead of being the center of attention on screen, he was able to share it with Ryan which supports in making the film amazing. It's nice to see Carrie Fisher do something great instead of the Star Wars franchise. Fisher has amazing comedic timing and she doesn't try to distract us from the lead characters. This also applies to Bruno Kirby who has moments that just has you laughing.\n\nWhen Harry Met Sally is one of the greatest of it's genre and it contains such likable leads and played by actors that are able to drive the film forward. Ephron has written an accessible and relatable script and Reiner has crafted a brilliant film that enhances the themes that drives Ephron's script. This is a film that I would recommend to everyone due to it's universal themes.",

First of all, Billy Crystal's and Meg Ryan's characters both have the worst long-term memory of all time.  They forget each other, forget friends from college, and basically forget to work, too (at least FEIGN a job scene please). I'd think \"hey, that's just a quirk in their characters,\" but all their friends seem to think the same way. Oh Well.  Slap a Cary Grant/Deborah Kerr ending on this an call it a classic I guess.

I don't know why, but it seemed lame and boring. He likes her, she likes him, some weak jokes and witty dialogue. \n\nBut then I saw it on sale in the blue ray garbage bin for like $4. A must buy right? So I ended up paying almost $20 for it as I found out after going through the receipt from Best Buy (watch out for that!).\n\nBoy am I glad I bought this movie. Watching it with my fiancee, we had a great time! It's really genuinely funny and VERY well written, acted and directed. It's got an excellent flow to it, and is such a light watch. It's without a doubt a guaranteed win date movie. \n\nIt's got romance, but not in a cheesy way. It's witty, but not hipsterish (that's my new word of the day). It's got chemistry between Meg Ryan and XXX, but it's not forced. It's just such a natural, entertaining experience, that flows like butter when heated to 30 degrees celsius.\n\nThe acting is just amazing. Meg Ryan's orgasm in the dinner is one of the best scenes in all of cinema, and watching it was even better than the hype. I had heard about that scene and it seemed interesting, but it was fantastically done.\n\nThe interviews that are dotted throughout the beginning of the movie are very heartwarming and have a genuine nature about them. Yes, I know they were probably actors reading lines, but it was a great idea and these people really did not feel like they were putting on an act.\n\nAll in all, if you still have not watched When Harry Met Sally, go out to your local Best Buy, search through the blu ray junk, find the disk and take it home. Naturally, check the receipt to make sure they haven't ripped you off first!",

The chemistry between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan is great, as they play their characters with a charm and charisma that is hard to find. Rob Reiner directing portrays the comedy of the situation and tenderness excellently. For example, in more than one scene the scene splits in two showing the conversation between four people. It shows the symmetry between Harry and Sally well and just adds to the quirkiness of the whole thing. The last thing that ties it all together is possibly the most important one. Nora Ephron writes with innocence and undeniable truth and comedy that is really just the icing on the cake.",

They part ways not expecting to see one another again. Sure enough they meet again and they both are in serious relationships with others. But a few more years down the line they cross paths and they both are having trouble getting over their failed love lives. With the situation the way it is, Harry and Sally decide to become friends and they begin to confide in each other while also spending more time together. However, they want to remain just friends and they set each other up with their best friend respectively. This ends in their best friends becoming romantically involved and it leaves Harry and Sally where they were before. When Sally is going through a tough time Harry comforts her and in the moment they make love. In the aftermath their relationship becomes tense and it ends in a fight. All alone on New Year's Eve they finally make up and share a kiss. They are finally a couple. This film has adult themes but Reiner makes this film a nostalgic feel in a way by using a flashback, voice-over, split screen, and conversations from married couples. Furthermore, the soundtrack by Harry Connick Jr. is reminiscent of crooners from a bygone era. In my mind, this film seemed very similar to some of the old romantic comedies including the Awful Truth.",

Obviously, the acting and chemistry is outstanding, with Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan turning in iconic and heartfelt performances, but even better the script is as deft as anything the genre has ever produced. The way Nora Ephron comments on gender relations and the differences between the sexes is particularly insightful, while oftentimes extremely hilarious at the same time. It allows the film to transcend the typical romcom outing to become a story first and foremost about relationships and characters that everyone can relate to. It's unconventional structuring, which frequently jumps around and at times plays like a collection of extended sequences, and the way in which the soundtrack draws from old classics only adds to the timeless appeal. It feels just as rewarding, fresh and relevant today as it must have back in 1989.",

  Does not this look a little too much like Annie Hall?  The dress here of Ryan is incredibly the same!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Caryn James called When Harry Met Sally... \"the sitcom version of a Woody Allen film, full of amusing lines and scenes, all infused with an uncomfortable sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\".\r\n\r\nAs to the revenue generated by this so called great film, it took 16 million to make it and garnered 95 million at the box office.  Compare that to another romance comedy My Big Fat Greek Wedding that cost only 5 million to make and earned 365 million dollars (USD).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEE the entire film here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5pci2fE96M\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I say EVERYTHING was stolen from Annie Hall, I mean even Billy Crystal's speaking style, Meg Ryan's demeanor and dialog.... its ALL been seen in a Woody Allen film one time or another be it Manhatten or Annie Hall.  \r\n\r\nSorry Crystal and Ryan fans, this film may have been hugely successful, but it made it off the ignorance of Allen films made a mere decade earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQDmvMLFn_tZpjlDL6ERXzt4Pf47fxuQXO8LMoQFJsX60dzi9Dy_g[/img]   Here the couple is shown sitting as a pair. Just like a half dozen of much older married folks shown the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n1  Billy Crystal was worried that the film would flop at the box office because it was up against several summer blockbuster films, like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Batman.\r\n\r\n2  The film led Roger Ebert to call Reiner \"one of Hollywood's very best directors of comedy\", and said that it was \"most conventional, in terms of structure and the way it fulfills our expectations. But what makes it special, apart from the Ephron screenplay, is the chemistry between Crystal and Ryan.\"\r\n\r\n3   David Ansen provided one of the rare negative reviews of the film for Newsweek. He criticized the casting of Crystal, \"Not surprisingly he handles the comedy superbly, but he's too cool and self-protective an actor to work as a romantic leading man\", and felt that as a film, \"of wonderful parts, it doesn't quite add up\".\r\n\r\n\r\n4   ....the film grossed a total of $92.8 million in North America, well above its $16 million budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRDWYimcuUGrJrkFfgmVabAczGPNkxJEGXT--a0ojf9IUs7ZZSe[/img]   After 5 years have gone by they meet\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIEWS:\r\n\r\n90%\r\n When Harry first met Sally, I found Billy Crystal really obnoxious by my god he grows on you, so witty, very entertaining indeed.

A sweet and charming movie with wonderful on-screen chemistry between the leads. I think I'm in love with Meg Ryan, she is so genuine and comfortable in this kind of role. It's a less cliche look at romance and at the same time, for me, a scary look into the single life in the 30's. Really nice film and maybe one of the best romance movies I've ever seen, not quite a RomCom, for the simple fact that it stays quite mature and any \"comedy\" comes from smart writing and the wit of Crystal. Excellent stuff.",

It's just too good of a movie and its wittiness and charm can't be imitated. Most of the credit can be attributed to Nora Ephron's honest, endlessly quotable screenplay, but then there's also the gifted direction of Rob Reiner and the central performances of Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, both of whom are fluid and hysterical in their roles. \"When Harry Met Sally...\" really is just a great little film, and if Nora Ephron were alive and able to write the rest of the world's romantic comedies, the genre might redeem itself.",

It view on how relationships develop is candid, real and very funny. It begins in 1977 in Chicago, where Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) and Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) share a car trip to New York. Harry is dating Sally's friend Amanda (Michelle Nicastro), and they talk about relationships and how they develop. Harry and Sally meet again 5 years later, this time on a plane, and get talking again. Then they meet again 5 years later in a book store, and rekindle their friendship, they try to set each other up with their friends Marie (Carrie Fisher) and Jess (Bruno Kirby), but it's Marie and Jess who end up in a relationship together, leaving Harry and Sally wondering whether they should commit. It's a very funny film, best known for the fake orgasm in the deli (\"I'll have what she's having!\") Crystal is a great actor, with a brilliant deadpan face, while Ryan gets some good laughs too. It's maybe the high water mark of Reiner's career, and he's always been in his element with comedy like this, but he's a director who can turn his attention to most genres and make something interesting.",

            "content": "Baby Fish Mouth!  Baby Fish Mouth!  \r\n\r\nOkay, this is about old enough so that I'm comfortable calling it a classic.  I don't think anything is going to happen in the next couple of years to make it suddenly forgotten.  I'm also inclined to think of it as one of the last of the Great Romantic Comedies.  I think the genre has gone kind of downhill in recent years, and I think it's missing a lot of what makes this particular film so good.  Once again, that's at least in part because they've missed what really made it fresh and good.  Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) talk about sex, mostly with other people, but they aren't graphic--except that one moment, which is fully clothed and more on which anon--and they are almost never vulgar.  They bicker, but they always, except at the beginning, seem to actually like each other anyway.  They both complain about Men and Women in the abstract, but they still genuinely like Men and Women.\r\n\r\nHarry Burns and Sally Albright meet the first time on the way from the University of Chicago to New York.  He hits on her.  She rebuffs him.  He tells her men and women can't be friends.  A few years later, they encounter each other again in an airport.  She is dating his friend Joe (Steven Ford), and he's marrying a woman named Helen (Harley Jane Kozak).  Policy against men and women being friends is reiterated.  A few years even after that, they meet again.  She has broken up with Joe, and Helen has left him.  They become friends.  She tries to set him up with her best friend, Marie (Carrie Fisher), and he tries to set her up with [i]his[/i] best friend, Jess (Bruno Kirby).  Marie and Jess, of course, fall in love with each other.  Harry and Sally date other people, but neither one seems to be serious about anyone.  One night, Sally calls Harry to tell him that Joe is getting married.  He comes over right away, as best friends do.  Things get a little friendlier than anticipated, and then things go wrong.\r\n\r\nI have always believed that it is a lie that men and women can't be friends.  I have plenty of male friends.  Heck, if you take Rob Reiner's standards, I'm not sure most people have many friends of any kind.  His definition of \"friend\" seems rather like mine for \"best friend\"--the person you can tell everything to.  Someone who you trust with your deepest secrets.  Someone who understands all of your most intense feelings.  Now, I've [i]had[/i] a male friend or two who met that definition, but I don't think every man or woman is capable of sharing that with someone of the opposite sex.  However, I do think that most men and women are capable of a more casual friendship with each other.  Yes, you'll often think about sex with them, but so what?  As long as you don't act on it or dwell on it, that doesn't matter.  We all have thoughts every day that we'd never actually act on, and we go on with our lives nonetheless.  Really, we have to in order to survive.\r\n\r\nWhat frustrates me about this movie is that apparently, its R rating comes from Sally's faked orgasm.  According to screenwriter Nora Ephron, she saw the movie on an airplane.  As is typical of airlines, it played not long after it was in the theatres.  (Quite possibly around the time I flew to New York, actually.)  This meant that any number of the passengers had seen it already.  As is also typical of airlines, they trimmed what they considered offensive content.  The entire conversation about faked orgasms was left in; the actual faked orgasm was not.  There's hardly any swearing to it.  While various characters are implied to be naked in several places, no actual nudity is seen.  Sally slaps Harry once, and that's it for violence.  However, Sally's sexuality?  Not allowed.  Obviously, if she's able to convince the people around them, she sounds real.  She must know what a real one sounds like, and female orgasms just generally aren't acceptable to the MPAA.  They're much more comfortable with male sexuality.\r\n\r\nOf course, everyone knows that the best part of the movie is the little old couples sitting on couches, telling the story of how they met.  What's perhaps less well known is that they're all based on true stories.  Oh, they're not playing themselves; those are all actors.  However, they are telling real stories.  Rob Reiner came up with the idea when, as a desperate ice breaker, he asked a friend's father how the father and mother had met.  The father lit up and told the story we hear at the very beginning of the film, and Rob Reiner knew that this was one thing all happy couples have in common.  They all know the story of how they met, and it always makes them happy to share it.  I'm not sure I completely agree; I think there are some pretty clueless people out there who can't remember at all.  But I do know that some dear friends of mine are hoping to adopt a child, and one of the things in the letter they've written to give to potential birth mothers is the story of how they met.",

It\u00e2(TM)s written and delivered so expertly it\u00e2(TM)s at times indecipherable from ad-lib. Like all the best romantic comedies it's a film with real heart about believable characters, and the comedy is allowed to stem from that - unlike so many of its contemporaries where relationships seem to have been roughly sketched around a few big set pieces or an overarching concept where the guy is secretly two twins (or something). It begins at a steady pace allowing us to bond with Harry and Sally before asking us to sympathise with them. This deliberate controlled direction by Rob Reiner gives the film some weight as well as humour, not simply rushing the character development to get the gags. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are superb as the \u00e2~couple\u00e2(TM) delivering pitch perfect performances that  don\u00e2(TM)t overshadow the quality of the material and investing real warmth and likeability into the characters. It\u00e2(TM)s a timeless, beautiful film that will still be relevant as long as the question \u00e2Can men and women be friends?\u00e2? is around.",

I felt like I have forgotten how it feels to watch a romantic movie and actually be happy for those involve when they get together.\n\nEveryone needs a regular dose of \"When Harry met Sally...\" once in a while to make you smile with apparently no reason at all.\n\nReiner said that he had always wanted to do a film about two people who become friends and do not have sex because they know it will ruin their relationship but have sex anyway. The movie itself is based on the very idea: can men and women be just platonic friends? Well to me from my experience the answer is NO! As long as there is constant communication, the man will want to sleep with her.\n\nThe movie is known for its Deli scene where Sally claims that men cannot tell the difference between when a woman is having an orgasm or when she is faking it, and to prove her point, she vividly (but fully clothed) fakes one as other diners watch. Then the movie dropped its popular line, when a woman from the diner who had been watching Sally demonstrate the fake orgasm placed an order saying, \"I'll have what she's having.\"\n\nThe movie tells the story of two people Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) who met in 1977 in a car ride where they both discussed if it was possible for men and women to have a platonic friendship. Harry disagrees while Sally believed it was possible. They parted ways only to meet 5 years after in an airport. Harry asked Sally if they could be friends but Sally refused and then parted again to meet 5 years after that in a coffee shop.\n\nThen they became close friends helping each other out through the struggles and being there for each other.\n\nIt all went well till the time came for them to answer the question, \"can a man and a woman be platonic friends without sex being involved?\"\n\nThe thing about the movie that keeps you going is the funny lines Billy Crystal delivers at every scene, add this to his acting and the persona of his character you have a guy that is fun to be with and fun to watch. Meg Ryan on the other hand plays a more subtle character who is more of amazement in the way she sees thing, that in fact there is never a dull moment with both characters.\n\nRob Reiner directing in this Romantic Comedy is top notch, he went on to make Sleepless In Seattle (1993) which was also one of the best romantic movies ever made and it also stars Meg Ryan, but nothing can stand up to \"When Harry met Sally...\"\n\nThis is my pick of best romantic movie I have seen till date.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

After hearing of Nora Ephron's untimely death, though, I felt compelled to finally watch this cinematic classic.  After viewing the movie, I could have kicked myself for not watching it sooner.  \"When Harry Met Sally\" is one of those rare romantic comedies that isn't cheesy.  It was smart, funny, and realistic.  It was also interesting viewing the movie in 2012 and seeing Meg Ryan at her best.  Ryan played the role of Sally perfectly.  She was endearing and sincere yet strong-willed.  It's been a long time since Meg Ryan was relevant in Hollywood (mostly due to her own self-destruction) but if she could tap back into what she put into the character Sally, she has the innate talent to be successful.  I definitely recommend this movie if you're looking for an intelligent and witty movie with a little bit of romance.",
