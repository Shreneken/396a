He learns that another archaeologist has disappeared while searching for the precious goblet, and the missing man is his own father, Dr. Henry Jones. The artifact is much harder to find than they expected, and its powers are too much for those impure in heart.",

The relationship between Indiana (Harrison Ford) and his father (Sean Connery) made this movie even better! This movie really delivers everything. When I first watched this film... Elsa's betrayal had my jaw dropped, the scene when Indiana was facing the tank had me jump up and down (Almost every fight scene did tbh), and the ending had me satisfied but also shocked! Best Indiana Jones movie of all time, first one is real close but this one JUST beats it!",

It kinda love the trilogy equally so I love this film just as much as Raiders and Doom. What I really like about it is that it feels like one big race to the Holy Grail between indy accompanied with his father and the nazis. It has the feeling of Raiders but not a rehash, everything is just top tier filmmaking. The action sequences are really good and the ending feels so earned and ended the trilogy in a perfect way I can't see it being done better. From beginning to end just perfect I wouldn't argue if it was you're favorite out of the films.",

Ford's interaction with Hitler in Germany is always an underrated yet iconic moment. If you have watched the first two movies in the franchise, then you have to finish it off with this one. This movie may be a bit hard to get into if you are not familiar with the Indy universe, but for adventure movie fans, this movie is a must-watch.",

It follows the typical Indiana Jones formula. \n\nI like how the movie opens up and shows us Indy as a young man. This was obviously done to set up the story, amongst other things. \n\nEven though it isn't my favorite Indy film, I think it has the best quest. It's not very intense, and I would dare say mild, but the story is great. We actually got two adventures in this film. The mission to find the father, and the quest for the Holy Grail. \n\nI could've done without the character of Elsa Schneider. The fact that she seduced, both father and son, was extremely disgusting to me. \n\nMy favorite scene was definitely when they were captured in the house and this led to the motorcycle chase. The way they escaped was fun to watch, and seeing Indy navigate the motorcycle with a sidecar was cool. \n\nCome to think about it, I might like this film more than I thought. I'll rewatch the entire series later on in the year and review again. \n\nDo I recommend this? Of course I do, it's Indiana Jones silly.\n\nThis gets a LennyReviewz Score of: 6/10",

Harrison Ford and Sean Connery are exquisite as father and son, and their dynamic adds an exciting kick to the movie. The story is well-crafted, John Williams' score is fantastic, and there's a reasonable number of action sequences to leave room for scenes that showcase the actors' performances.",

Throw in the charming Professor Jones Sr. (Sean Connery) to spice things up a bit and you're left with an exciting, if not totally original, action adventure that sticks to the original winning formula and proves to be a lot of fun.  This time around, Indiana is in search of the Holy Grail instead of the Lost Ark, but everything else, with the exception of the exotic locales, remains pretty much the same.  While it all has the distinct feel of a Spielberg money grab, it is still pretty decent mindless entertainment.",

He went missing in pursuit of his life's passion project: locating the fabled Holy Grail.  Will Indiana be able to pick up his trail?  Now I have always considered this to be my favorite Indiana Jones movie.  Not to take anything away from Raiders, which was inarguably a game changer, but Last Crusade always spoke to me more.  I'm slowly making my way through the entire series as I find spare time on the weekends, and yeah, I still feel the same way after all these years.  There is just so much to love about this movie.  Yes, it exceeds a two-hour mark when you keep the end credits, but it is all gravy in my book.  You could probably cut the opening where you get to see young Indiana as portrayed by the late River Phoenix if you really had to, but I love it because it functions as a standalone mini-movie in addition to showing the restrained relationship Indy had with his father growing up.  You can watch it by itself and still get that adventure itch scratched in the way that only Indiana Jones can do.  The rest of the movie all fits together with that same fluidity, and scenes flow effortlessly into the next one.  I feel like they recognized what was successful from the previous two films and leaned into what works, especially with the comedy.  There are off-handed one-liners galore in this, and they will almost always get a big belly laugh out of me.  I'm sure this movie in particular was a huge inspiration to the Uncharted video game series; Indiana Jones was always the goal for that video game, but the laugh-action balance is completely in step with this chapter right here.  As far as notes go, I don't have much.  Sean Connery brings a wonderful dynamic to the story, and not only that, but everything about the character also makes you further understand why Indiana is the way that he is in the previous movies you have already seen.  It takes a special kind of sequel to improve the films that precede it, and Last Crusade is absolutely up to the challenge.",

The action is epic, and I liked the neat sequence at the beginning that explains things such as Indy's fear of snakes and how he got the scar on his chin. Steven Spielburg does an excellent job directing, while both Harrison Ford and Sean Connery(in a masterstroke of casting) are perfectly cast as Indy and Indy's father. On the whole, exciting, witty and fun. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The Last Crusade improves on Temple of Doom while just lacking the brisk efficiency of Raiders. It looks fabulous and has a great music score. The script is deliciously witty especially with the interplay between Ford and Connery, and the story is engaging. The action is epic, and I liked the neat sequence at the beginning that explains things such as Indy's fear of snakes and how he got the scar on his chin. Steven Spielburg does an excellent job directing, while both Harrison Ford and Sean Connery(in a masterstroke of casting) are perfectly cast as Indy and Indy's father. On the whole, exciting, witty and fun. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Additionally, the introduction of Sean Connery as Indiana Jones' father was a brilliant move, and the fact that he's a well-realized and immensely flawed character, yet likable nonetheless, only serves to add to the movie's strengths.  Throw in a more versatile change of landscapes from Act to Act, some fantastic adrenaline rush moments and a surprisingly thoughtful and emotional climax, and you've got a movie that is a genuinely excellent work of cinema on its own merits, even without taking the first two into account.

It's an awesome movie in general, and has stood the test of 4 decades with effortless bravura. It's a must watch for all the family. Trust me. I mean it. Watch it.

It almost is just a highlight of the ridiculous lengths that Nazi's went to look for weird resources: the occult (\"Hellboy\"), artifacts, and investigations into alien contact.\n\nThis is a return to quality though, it takes up the more serious atmosphere of the first movie and with that concentrates on a dramatically good action adventure movie.\n\nThis is my favorite of the franchise.",

Ford and Connery are excellent together, raising the film's pedigree whilst also adding better humour. Even away from those two, the cast is a marked improvement as we see John Rhys-Davies return alongside newcomer Julian Glover.\n\nThe plot is still the weaker part of Indiana Jones, at least to me. I wasn't really interested in the objective of The Last Crusade, not that I was bored but I wasn't overly engrossed; just like with 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'.\n\nThere's still a lot of good to this though, particularly with John Williams' music once more.

Steven Spielberg's 20th masterpiece (they're all masterpieces in my eye) constantly delivers punchy lines, tricky scenarios, and general hilarious-ness (it features Hitler giving out autographs!)\n\nBeginning with Junior's backstory in the sandy desert of Utah (portrayed by fellow charming scoundrel River Phoenix), we learn how Indy got the scar, the Fedora and Ophidiophobia (fear of snakes— duh).\n\nIt's a movie with perfect narrative and lots of talking (similar to a 007 film), with a climax as long and action-packed as all the others, leaving viewers boggling their eyes out for at least ten minutes.\n\nI might add that a movie centered almost entirely on The Holy Grail is not your average Spielberg-ian flick. It delves deep into the concept of \"belief\" and putting one's trust (and life) in the lord's hands. But does it work? Of course it does! Its Steven directing, how could it not?\n\nSo, with Harrison following the clues alongside Nazi spy Elsa Schneider, colleague Marcus Brody and, eventually, Sean Connery (who makes a very \"unexpected\" first appearance), we face off against the movie industry's favourite (and franchise's original) foe: Nazis. Featuring is Michael Byrne (aka Grindelwald in Deathly Hallows P1), a man, it seems, who's been in just about every Nazi movie ever (with more than a third of his acting credits either German, Russian, or army-related! — they're probably all bad guys).\n\nAnd alongside him is double-crosser Donovan, acted by Julian Glover; an actor with an equally prolific career, ranging from Bond villain Aristotle Kristatos and Star Wars General Maximilian Veers, to Aragog in The Chamber of Secrets (yup, they're both in Harry Potter! Huh, not much of a range then— just bad guys!\n\nThe one problem I have with this movie is it's high level of predictability and gullibility*, Indiana's character seems all too credulous (although it is tough to tell whether your German girl-friend is about to get shot or is actually a Nazi and acting as bait). I guess the biggest problem with me was knowing Walter Donovan was evil from the very start. Could've made that a bit less obvious.\n\nApart from that, the film was fabulous; keeping original while staying in tune with the other two.

And while it is not as good as the original Raiders of the Lost Ark, it is far better than the other two [soon to be three] in the series. I found that with the fifth installment of the Indiana Jones series coming up next year, I should re-watch the first four. If you have read my reviews for them [which you probably haven't], you will find that I gave Raiders a 5/5 and Temple a 3.5/5, and I'm still trying my hardest to avoid the carnage known as Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Now, if you haven't noticed, I have given the Last Crusade a 5/5. Why, you may ask? Because, just like the first one, it is funny and thrilling, and very original. The original Jones movie featured a standard plot, guy vs Nazis with love interest. It sounds lame, but it works incredibly well. For the second one, they didn't have any fresh ideas; just turn the Nazis into some Indian cult. Last Crusade keeps the Nazis, which, if I'm going to be honest, prefer over the Indian culture with an underground Nike sweatshop. However, it twists the romance side plot, and adds Indiana Jones' dad. Now THAT is awesome. Sean Connery and Harrison Ford clearly have nice chemistry in this film, making it funny in between all the action sequences, which, despite outdated special effects, are still awesome. [Which is another reason I didn't like Temple, the action sequences are super lame, but you should probably just read my review instead.] If you enjoyed the first one, I suggest you watch this one. It is almost as awesome as the first.",

The scene where the Order of the Cruciformed Sword attack the Nazis and Indy's father exclaims, 'Now who are all these people!?' will always make me laugh.\n\nThere is action and adventure aplenty in The Last Crusade. The entire tank sequence, in particular, is such a memorable setting and scene.\n\nDespite my overwhelming praise, The Last Crusade is far from a perfect film. Sure there are plot holes, and Indiana suffers from the \"immortal hero\" syndrome. Alison Doody's acting is questionable at times, but nothing compared to the atrocity that was Kate Capshaw in Temple of Doom.\n\nThere is a theme of Indiana's reluctance to believe in the supernatural, despite being proven wrong time and again, that really comes to light when you watch all three movies back to back. By the finale of The Last Crusade, Indy has become a believer.\n\nThe worst part of The Last Crusade is watching our heroes ride off into the sunset, knowing that no other adventure movie will fill the immense void left by Indiana Jones.",

We see a young Indiana Jones, played perfectly in character by River Phoenix, at the start of his adventures. All the way to Indiana Jones, played heroically and hilariously by Harrison Ford, through to his most religious quest yet as he searches for The Holy Grail. \n\nThematically, we witness Indiana struggle to find his faith as he once again must wrestle between science and religion. Additionally, Indiana must come to terms with his father Dr. Henry Jones Sr., played wonderfully by the ever delightful Sean Connery. Furthermore, Indiana has to pick from greed, glory, lust, or family. In regards to lust, Indiana wants love in the character of Dr. Elsa Schneider played by the sultry Alison Doody. Doody is not only gorgeous, but a cruel femme fatale and foil for Ford act opposite.\n\nConcerning Spielberg's direction, Spielberg masterfully takes the audience from one thrilling action set piece to another. Every location around the world is a ton of fun. The action, fights, and dialogue is as good as this series gets. All Spielberg's clever framing, lovely vistas, long panning shots, and realistic set design is on point. The Last Crusade is Spielberg at his creative peak.\n\nMusically, John Williams brings his classic score for Indiana Jones to life anew with his latest version of the theme. Adventure and mysterious are complemented by Williams' score in its wispy hymns.\n\nOverall, Spielberg should have ended the entire Indiana Jones franchise in 1989 with The Last Crusade on a massive high note. This movie is still exhilarating, engaging, and hilarious. You should certainly watch the Indiana Jones trilogy, but stop there and do not bother with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Give The Last Crusade a chance and it will not disappoint!",

            "content": "After two successful big-budget starring vehicles, we finally get an origin story for Indiana Jones. Of course, that's largely to facilitate the addition of a new supporting character (Sean Connery in a wonderful casting as Indy's long lost father, who we'll get to in just a moment) but that extra layer of nostalgia, wrapped around a property that's deeply nostalgic in the first place, manages to avoid numerous pitfalls and serve as an effective prologue. River Phoenix performs especially well as the young Jones, expertly wearing Harrison Ford's mannerisms throughout the long callback, and somewhere along the way we get a worthwhile genesis for the grown-up version's affinity for leather jackets and fedoras.\n\nOnce the story jumps ahead to a more familiar era (if not precisely the present), it's full speed ahead on the hunt for the mythical holy grail, a lifelong obsession for the father and recent fixation of the third reich. Soon reunited, both Jones boys dance through precarious situations and near-misses in the history books, a full battalion of Nazi soldiers nipping at their heels, before drawing close to the prize. Ford and Connery are dynamic together, boiling down a complicated father-son relationship to a series of glares, grins and grunts. They alternate between bickering testily and slapping each other on the back in camaraderie, and I honestly can't say which makes for a more entertaining watch. There's depth, too, a stinging blend of long-simmering resentment and earnest care for one another, which often bubbles up just in time to enhance the plot's heaviest moments.\n\nNaturally, it simply wouldn't be an Indiana Jones movie without big action sets (in which the series somehow manages to one-up itself yet again) or boatloads of witty retorts and punchy one-liners, and those two essential elements combine to give the film a loose, fun-loving quality without compromising any of the more serious moments. All this without going too far over the top, as we saw more than once in the mildly underwhelming Temple of Doom and borderline-disastrous Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It's well-written and purposeful, successfully intense and humorous, an in-the-wheelhouse serial-styled adventure that spans several continents before confronting superstition and cracking several dusty, life-threatening riddles on the path to a biblical treasure. Indy probably should've left well-enough alone, because this chapter is essentially impossible to top.",

            "content": "Adjust your fedoras and crack your whip with excitement at this third film in the Indiana Jones series. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is an important film for the industry. With this movie, we are reminded that an already well-rounded franchise can still surprise audiences and get \"bigger and better.\" While not being a trilogy in a traditional sense (one continuous story told in three films), each film in the series is interwoven with one another in multiple ways, despite being, for the most part, independent of each other (you do not need to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark to understand everything about the other two original movies). Continuing themes in the films are what help to hold them together; score and characters appearing in more than one film help with the all-around coherence of all three films. While still keeping the films mostly independent from each other, the occasional reference backwards in the series reminds viewers that this is the same world. Through the colorful cast, vibrant music, and comically wholesome story, we are taken once again into the pre-World War II life of Indiana Jones.\n\nOne of the incredible things that is always taken out of films is the score. John Williams returns to compose the film's musical stylings. With this job comes one of the most recognizable themes in film history. The march that accompanies Indiana Jones all around the world is iconic for all film enthusiasts, and even most people who have never seen any of the films. In this third iteration, Williams creates more masterfully written pieces that add a level of depth that only this composer can accomplish. Adventurous at one moment, and mysteriously grandiose the next. His music also conveys character emotion in ways that some other musicians only dream of, and this relationship is shown explicitly with the cast of the movie.\n\nAt the forefront of the movie, as well as the whole series, Harrison Ford portrays the charismatic and charming titular Indiana Jones. While the appearance of his \"typical\" female companion (played by Alison Doody) is welcome and expected in this feature, this is not the character dynamic that defines this movie. Sean Connery's portrayal of Henry Jones, Senior (Indy's father) makes this film stand out, as their dynamic carries the plot in a new way that the series had not attempted in the past. Other stars include returning Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies as Marcus Brody and Sallah, respectively from Raiders. These characters help to bring familiarity to the film as well as providing suitable \"bookends\" to the series as they both appeared in the first and third films.\nFrom a character standpoint, the villainous characters leave some things to be desired. The main villain played by Julian Glover could have played a larger role in the movie, but since his presence is not the main point of the film, his not perfect character is just bad enough to be believable, but is a footnote compared to the villains of the previous two films. \n\nSome of the film aspects that critics say is that it is too similar to the original film. While some very general things can be considered the same, it is the expansions that are made to the series that allows for a much more interesting experience. The action is on par or better than the other two films, or at the very least has higher stakes for the characters involved. The plot moves forward by this action, as well as the characters' interactions with each other. Indy and his father both change for the better in the movie; they learn to respect each other and repair their relationship after years of separation; It is through this bond that ensures these first three movies have a satisfying conclusion.",

Yes, better than Raiders of the Lost Ark and DEFINITELY an improvement over that terrifying yet still somehow entertaining Temple of Doom movie. Good news, they got rid of Spielberg's wife and Indy's Chinese kid sidekick in this one. I definitely find this to be the funniest out of the three with Sean Connery's hilarious performance along with a father-like feel to Harrison Ford, who once again does another great job as Indy. The action sequences are as fun as always and there are humorous moments every now and then to lighten the tension. I doubt I'll ever see anything funnier in this franchise than Indy posing as a ticket checker and throwing a Nazi officer looking for the Joneses and after saying \"no ticket\" scares everyone into presenting their tickets.  Hilarious. The Last Crusade: one of the best movie sequels ever made  and one of my favourite Spielberg movies of all time.",

Sean Connery really is so good as Indiana's father that you can actualy see him being his father in real life. Just like the first 2 films in the franchise it has everything you have come to expect from an Indiana film. I also love that we get to see a small taste of our hero's childhood. It follows the exact same formula as the first 2 but that's what makes a successful franchise. Some of the old favourite characters return and join in on the adventure which was a refreshing change. With this film Spielberg and Lucas insured that they created a truly successful trilogy of films that could even rival Star Wars. I would go so far as to say that in some ways Indiana Jones is a stronger trilogy than the first Star Wars trilogy simply because with this film Indiana realy does end on a strong note.",

Last Crusade brings back the exciting sense of adventure that Raiders of the Lost Ark did all those years ago without needlessly going overly grim and dark like Temple of Doom did.\n\nThe plot itself, Indy is once again fighting the Nazis in a race to reach the Holy Grail, is a lot more straightforward and even feels more intimate for Indy (it mainly revolves around his father after all). There's a touching father-son bond throughout that blends so well against the greater scale story.\n\nOne of this film's biggest attributes is the supporting characters. Unlike Temple's characters who mainly ranged from annoying to forgettable (save Amrish Puri as Mola Ram), Crusade brings us a welcome mix of old friends (the always wonderful John Rhys-Davies as Sallah and Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody) and new (Sean Connery as Henry Sr. and Alison Doody as Elsa Schneider). Whereas Willie Scott and Short Round were such extreme character types that it was difficult to sympathize with them, Elsa and Henry are far more toned down but not without likable personalities.\n\nIf I had any complaints, the opening with young Indy feels a bit rushed and ridiculous, even for this sort of movie. The fact that all of his personality quirks and physical scars came about in the span of ten minutes is pretty hard to believe.\n\nStill, that's a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things. The Last Crusade is an excellent adventure film and a fond farewell to the Indiana Jones franchise. Well, at least for now.",

            "content": "Before even the days of \"Raiders Of The Ark\", Spielberg had expressed an interest in making a James Bond movie but he couldn't get the go-ahead from Bond producer Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli. Indy was just as good an opportunity for him, though, and who better to cast as Indy's father than (the original) James Bond himself? It's actually through the casting choice of Sean Connery that this third instalment of Indy's adventures really takes flight and silences the critics of \"The Temple Of Doom\".\n\nIn his third outing, Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) goes in search of his father, Prof. Henry Jones Sr (Sean Connery) who mysteriously disappeared while searching for the Holy Grail. Once again, though, the Nazi's are also in tow. After losing on the Ark of the Covenant, they too want to get their hands on the Cup of Christ.\n\nBy the time of this films release everybody was fully aware of Indiana Jones. With only two films under his fedora, every woman wanted him and every man wanted to be him; Indy had already become an icon of American cinema. With a fond familiarity, people welcomed him into their homes and that's the very reason why the opening of this third instalment is such a joy. It's depiction of Indy in his youth is wonderful addition to his backstory and the late great River Phoenix does an excellent job in capturing Ford's mannerisms. We learn of his use of the whip and the resulting scar on his chin. We also get an insight into the procurement of his famous fedora and how his unusual name of \"Indiana\" originated from the family dog... (It was actually George Lucas' dog that was named Indiana and it also served as the inspiration for Chewbacca in \"Star Wars\").\n\nAfter being heavily criticised for his dark tone in \"Temple of Doom\", Spielberg finds his lighter side again and delivers the funniest and most gleefully entertaining of Indy's adventures. The likes of Denholm Elliott and John Rhys Davies return from Raiders with more fleshed out comical roles but, as mentioned, it's the great interplay between Ford and Connery that's the biggest draw to here. The chemistry between them anchors a poignant family adventure while providing numerous father/son comedic moments.\n\nLike the previous two, though, there's no shortest of nail-biting action as World War II is on the brink and the Nazi's are once again Indy's foes and gives Spielberg another chance to put the Third Reich to the test. \"Schindler's List\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\" are obviously his more personal films on the subject but with Indy he gets the chance to have fun with them again, leaving this third instalment with more in common with \"Raiders\" as well as honing in on the biblical aspects of the story. Out goes the Ark and in comes the coveted Holy Grail and while the fourth film in the franchise - \"The Kingdom Of The Crystal\" - explores a misjudged science-fiction element, it confirms that Indy's adventures are better left in the paths of the religious or the occult.\n\nRaiders may still be the absolute classic of them all but it's hard to give a film with as much excitement and entertainment as this, anything less than top marks.\n\nMark Walker",

The adventure this time sees Indiana Jones teamed up with his father who is able to bring both emotional value to the story and comedic value which is beyond the juvenile nature of its predecessor while also transcending the overdone damsel in distress trope which has already been explored twice in the series and was worn to death by Wilhelmina \"Willie\" Scott's incessant ramblings in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. The dark themes of that film are replaced by a more big scale adventure which is surprisingly ripe with grit this time around.\nMany scenes in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade depict the series going in a different angle, in particular the notable boat chase scene. While certain moments in this still mirror scenes from Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, it adopts a more contemporary spy thriller concept reminiscent of James Bond, ensuring that exhilarating action is brought into play in a manner new to the series and appealing to modern audiences. However, the key focus eventually proves itself to be a more war-themed concept. The return of Nazis to the film does not seem repetitive as this time the film takes an approach more familiar of John Sturges' 1963 war epic The Great Escape all while maintaining the same adventure serial theme, and later on it even goes along the angles of Howard Hughes' 1930 war blockbuster Hell's Angels. The debt that Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade owes to great war films is explored with exceptional action sequences on an all new scale for the series. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has the most technologically impressive action of the trilogy. The stunts in the film are exceptionally impressive in terms of creativity and genuine technical value, as well as the fact that they are extremely intense which benefits the atmosphere greatly. Yet at the same time, they integrate humour into the experience very nicely. As well as being high quality, the general quantity of action in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is at a new level of impressive for the series. The production values of the film in general are excellent due to the western scenery as well as the timely props and costumes, as well as the impressive visual and sound effects. Everything is captured with beautifully atmospheric cinematography as well, and the musical score is once again brilliant. While maintaining the same lighthearted charm and iconic theme song of the preceding Indiana Jones films, the musical score in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade raises the scale of things and grasps its war themes incredibly well which brings a firm level of raw grit to the feature. John Williams deservedly reaches three for three with Academy Award nominations for his work on the Indiana Jones films.\nAnd the cast of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade prove once again brilliant.\nHarrison Ford brings his charismatic adventure spirit back to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and nails the character brilliantly once again. By this point in the series there is not too much new he can bring to the character, and yet the screenwriters find a way to ensure he does just that. The result ends up being an exploration of Harrison Ford's comedic charisma as he maintains the same cheesy yet legitimate heroism of the character while expanding upon his comedic value significantly more. This comes predominantly from his chemistry with Sean Connery which shows him working with the Academy Award winning actor very impressively. Harrison Ford's iconic charm pays a lot of benefit to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade by letting him carry the film on his shoulders once again. He is as strong as ever, and his determined involvement in the high calibre action scenes show his consistent physical strength as an adventure hero. Yet they do not play second fiddle to his natural acting charms as he once again gets every inch of the character well enough to transcend the archetype of a cheesy serial adventure hero, all while playing to his debt to such a character honourably.\nSean Connery is also a brilliant newcomer. As the father of Indiana Jones, Sean Connery's main value in the story is to make the tale more compelling and provide comic relief at the same time which he does with incredible ease. The man's natural charm draws viewers in, and the way that he works with Harrison Ford is just hilarious due to the father-son banter of the film. Sean Connery is at some of his all time funniest in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade because he serves as the comic relief and nails that with natural ease and charm, all while delivering his lines with an instinctive sense of wisdom to pay effect to the character very well. \nJulian Glover's role as Walter Donovan is also powerful. Although his part is brief, Julian Glover is easily able to go between being a seemingly friendly man and a relentlessly imtimidating villain. The transition is most unexpected and dramatically powerful, and the way that Julian Glover deals his words so tenaciously proves rather intimidating at times. He proves his strength in the dramatic aspects of the story as it progresses and we see more sides to the character, and Julian Glover keeps up with the progressing narrative of the story with a consistent sense of manipulative sadism buried within the role.\nAlison Doody makes a memorable appearance as well. As the damsel in distress trope has been exhausted by the preceding Indiana Jones films, Alison Doody has to take a new perspective on the female lead of this Indiana Jones adventure. The perspective proves to be a tricky one with unpredictable twists and turns where she consistently proves herself capable of making a consistent impression from both a comedic and dramatic perspective. Alison Doody proves herself a capable foil in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade by delivering a performance which stands out as strong enough not to be compared to Karen Allen or Kate Capshaw.\nLastly, River Phoenix's brief appearance is also very memorable. The way that River Phoenix captures the fearless dedication of Harrison Ford makes him a perfect embodiment of a younger Indiana Jones. He mimics the firm physical style of the character while putting his own charming spin on the role. River Phoenix is a perfect fit for the role, and his cameo is a clear signifier of his potential as a blockbuster star in a career which was cut tragically short. It is just great that we got to see him give it a shot for once in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade though.\n\n\nSo  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade proves to be a brilliant sequel and excellent finale to the trilogy, bringing back the western theme from the beginning and integrating war themes in with top production values, exceptional action and an awesome cast.",

The acting and script are the same as the others; good, and the pace is about the same as well.  Overall it feels very similar, but with some better action.  More military based, maybe too big of a scale for even Indy to handle, but naturally he doesn't seem to have much difficulty.  The beginning is cool showing him when he was younger, and catching up with time as he finds the cross e was been always searching for.  Then it's all about the Nazies and the search for the book.  It has some good humour in the right places, is exciting and action packed, and isn't too serious.  The plane chase is awesome, the bike chase exciting and the tank battle in the desert is also a highlight.  There is no such tank in real life, but it is a convincing invention that is outdated for the time this film takes place.  The ending is actually not as over the top and dumb as the original and as the Crystal Skull, but still has it's fair share of laughing moments.   Of course the medieval knights didn't have the technology to make those traps, but the power of the water in the 'cup of Christ' was actually cool when both taking or giving life. Wish this wasn't the last film in the original trilogy, as it is one of the best ones, and has the classic cool feel.  Well done, probably my favourite in the series even over the original, simply because of the ending and less over the top powers and other small problems.  One of my favourite childhood movies.",

Now for me this film didn't do it better than the first one but it was a definite improvement over the not as good Temple of Doom. It bought back the action adventure elements that were missing in Temple of Doom and made this so fun and entertaining to watch. Along with the classic action sequences there was still plenty of room for the comedy that you expect in the series and it delivered a lot more that the previous film, as the first one did. Plot wise, it took an approach more similar to that of Raiders of the Lost Arc, which i found to be a very interesting and engaging plot. At some points it did feel like i had seen similar things in the first film but it was for the most part full of fresh new ideas, better comedy and surprise twists. \n\nThe best thing about this film had to be the addition as Sean Connery as Dr. Henry Jones, and his amazing chemistry with his son Indiana Jones. These two really led the movie for the last two thirds and they only made  it better. Their relationship was entertaining, funny, and felt really natural. Once again John Williams with another great score that can instantly improve any film with its classic, memorable songs. In the end Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade brings this series back to the tomb raiding that made the first film so memorable and provides another fantastic action adventure film that anyone can enjoy. - 8.7",

It recycles a few elements from Raiders (The Nazi's as villains doesn't really work that well this time around, and is it just me or does the tank scene remind anyone else of the truck chase in the first film).

            "content": "It's almost impossible for me not to compare this with Raiders. That may not be fair but how can I not, when it's in the same series and so similar? I feel like this movie is just a rehash of many of the same devices in Raiders, but less effective. Like Spielberg just used the same formula as Raiders trying to recreate the success after Doom didn't go over so well. Maybe it's just the nostalgia because I've been obsessed with Raiders since I was a kid, but Crusade just doesn't do it for me. It's okay. I just don't think it's nearly as fun or exuberant and I just don't get excited watching it or get those \"WOW!\" moments that Raiders gives me. Donovan is pretty lame and weak compared to Belloq. There was this menacing danger looming about the Ark that I never felt with the Holy Grail. There's this weird \"Do you believe in the Grail?\" theme of faith and religion that I just don't understand. It's more about the father-son relationship and I just don't care. I think Elsa is flat and uninteresting in the token-hot-chick role. She's nowhere near as fully realized or enjoyable as Karen Allen. This movie is a little goofier and a bit harder for me to swallow in that respect. Raiders was goofy too but it was joyful and I don't feel that same joy here. The action scenes are pretty good, but to be honest I was nodding off during the plane and tank chases, given their length. I like all the stuff when they get to the cave at the end. The rapid-aging is a cool effect but I just don't get the same satisfaction and \"OMG! THAT WAS SO COOL!\" rush I get when those three guys get epically destroyed by the forces in the Ark. I'm sorry that I can't seem to take this movie on its own terms and not bring it's cool older sibling into review. I just hate seeing the first entry in a series be SO FRESH and then the director decides to just re-use the same formula for another installment to insure it's success. Can't stand it. Like Star Trek: Into Darkness and The Hangover II. Empire Strikes Back and The Dark Knight and Terminator 2 did it wonderfully. It can be done!",

            "content": "Five years after the disappointing \"Temple of Doom\", Spielberg and Lucas decided to return to the \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" type of story but now adding a new element to make the final chapter of the trilogy stand out: Indiana´s father now joins him in this adventure. \nIn 1938, Indy finds out that his father went missing while searching for the Holy Grail, soon Indy receives his father´s journal and this tells him that his father is alive and needs his help to find the Holy Grail. \nWhen I saw \"Raiders\", I loved the story and the characters but really hated the over the top campy vibe which wouldn't allow me to take the Nazi treat seriously but the darker and serious toned \"Temple of Doom\" destroyed those two elements I loved so I was excited for \"The Last Crusade\" to redeem the franchise and to end on a good note this beloved trilogy. \"The Last Crusade\" went to safe territory by repeating lots of the elements that made \"Raiders\" the beloved film it is: Some of the likeable characters are back, the actually funny comedy returns, Spielberg's classic direction is back, again counts with beautiful locations, a somewhat credible and charismatic love interest, another quest for a religious artifact, and Nazis are again the bad guys. So then what makes \"The Last Crusade\" a new adventure worth seeing? The answer is simple: Sean Connery as Dr Henry Jones, Indy´s father. The addition of Connery´s character creates a fun dynamic between him and his charismatic son who resents him a little because of the fact that his father was absent for most of his life; it becomes the film´s main plot point, overshadowing the search of the Holy Grail thanks to Sean Connery´s charismatic and funny performance at the same level as Ford is with Indiana. But even if the addition of Indy´s father makes the film stand out and provides some funny moments, it also makes the already over the top campy vibe even more silly and more difficult to take seriously.\n\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" is worthy final chapter of the trilogy thanks to Sean Connery´s performance and the chemistry between him and Harrison Ford, but emulates \"Raider of the Lost Ark\" too much and lacks its charm.",

            "content": "Let me be up front and say that Raiders of the Lost Ark is indeed a great movie that I absolutely love and will gladly watch any day. That being said, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is even better. Obviously this is my opinion, and people will dispute this with me forever, and I'm perfectly willing to admit that nostalgia plays into my opinion somewhat. I was a bit young when I first saw Raiders, but Last Crusade hit me at the perfect age. But I do have reasons aside from warm fuzzy feelings that make me love Last Crusade so much. First and foremost of those is the humor. From the opening sequence all the way to the end there are so many good laughs in this movie. Just thinking of certain scenes have me chuckling as I type this (\"X marks the spot.\") It adds something to the action when they mix in that levity, and I find it irresistible. Then there is the big surprise of this movie. From the outset they sell viewers on this film being a retread of the same formula from the previous films in the series. But all of this is changed in one scene when we realize that Indiana will not be going on this adventure with another woman by his side. Instead the sidekick will be his father.\n\nHow awesome is Sean Connery? I mean his interplay with Harrison Ford is just amazing. This storyline gives some good background to the character of Indiana Jones and it also creates some added depth. I love that they largely eschew another shallow romance, and focus on a more character-defining relationship instead. This makes the climax of the movie so much more powerful, and I get the impression that Indy has actually grown by the end of the movie. Speaking of that climax, it is one of my favorite sequences in movie history. I love that the booby traps actually connect with the story being told. The one aspect I haven't even touched on are the action scenes, but they are worth mentioning because they are executed brilliantly. I greatly appreciate how they continued to use so many practical effects and professional stunt men. The boat chase, the plane chase, and the tank chase are all wonderful and get my heart pumping every time. Yes, I can't come up with a single complaint for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. It is one of my favorite movies of all time and easily my top film in the franchise.",

            "content": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the last of the 80's Indiana Jones and an adventure that more than matches any other like it that's out there. With fine performances throughout the good guys in this, The Last Crusade is truly one that is a well played out one, and also very funny. Does it match up to Raiders, well we will have to see as I write this review but be safe in the knowing this is thoroughly entertaining stuff. \n\nHarrison Ford is of course the man donning the whip and fedora again and is off on yet another quest, but this time it is his father he needs. In this film we are introduced to Indiana's father, Henry Jones Sr, who to Indiana's annoyance always calls him \"Junior\". Sean Connery is the actor stepping into the boots of Jones Sr and he makes a fantastic addition to the series, I'd even go as far to say he is the best new character in the series since well, Indiana Jones. As for rest of the cast it is Julian Glover who I wasn't so keen on, I wasn't sure if it was the poor accent or just the circumstances that happen but I just felt he was a little stale. Denholm Elliot as Dr Marcus Brody returns, this time he is maybe not in it as much as he could have been but is still a welcome return and an addition to a cast full of personality. \n\nSpielberg I feel is not at his absolute finest here, his direction can feel a little sticky at times, not that it is bad but just not as good as say Raiders. It is written fairly well, the script not maybe blowing me away in the more serious moments or even parts where it is downright ridiculous, but the comedy styling that is put upon Connery and Ford is one of the up most brilliance. It is that partnership between them that is one of the most immortalising things about this movie, the addition of Connery's character instantly makes this better and the workmanship between him and Harrison Ford is one that for me makes them two one of the best film duos's of all time.\n\nThe effects are ramped up for this one, of course years had passed since the last two and the movie really knows how to utilize new found techniques. It is the explosions that for me are just better, this film is bigger than past seen, much more action means much more effects and it is great to see them used properly(and not overused either). Staying on the technical side of things the cinematography by Douglas Slocombe is still as ever marvellous, he just seems to know how to film an action adventure movie, never makes it boring angles, always quick but swift shots.\n\nSo, is this addition in the Indian Jones movie collection the best? well that is a tough question. Raiders of the Lost Ark I know is a movie people find a special one, a movie that many consider their all time favourite, of any movie period. For me although I did watch Raiders and found it really good, I think the Last Crusade is too and deserves a place like Raiders in the heart of film fans, I don't think the Last Crusade is anything special that saying, but is still a highly entertaining piece of cinema and one I feel will endure for years to come.\n\nSo overall the film is great, a movie I would recommend to anyone really as it contains a bit of everything, action, adventure but most importantly for me, it has laughter, this for me I can be sure of, is the funniest of the series. Sean Connery is the stand out performer in my opinion, maybe he even deserved awards for what he did here, and the chemistry here between father and son is one of great fun and great humour.",

The action scenes are typically thrilling and well shot, and are not as over-the-top as in Temple of Doom, the film offers loads and loads of great laughs, and Harrison Ford and Sean Connery have some of the best chemistry ever seen in film. Connery is only 12 years older than Ford, but both manage to convince the viewer they are real father and son, and though the film is often at its funniest when they're playing off each other, their relationship is also emotional and quite touching, without ever being sentimental. There is also fine support from Julian Glover and Allison Doody. It is really hard to find anything negative to say about this.

Of course, the film rests primarily on the shoulders of Harrison Ford, and he does not disappoint. The introduction of Sean Connery as Jones' professor father creates the perfect character foil, as their sparring with each other adds a good dose of humor. Additionally, Alison Doody gives a respectable performance as the icy Nazi agent Elsa. The plot, which revolves around a quest for the Holy Grail, is a little more exciting on paper than it turns out to be in practice. Still, there are plenty of exciting aspects of the Jones' adventures, from speedboat pursuits in Venice to a castle break-in in Germany. Indy even accidentally gets a book signed by Adolf Hitler while incognito in Berlin. Aside from the acting and plot, 'Crusade' benefits from another solid soundtrack from John Williams, which arguably is the proverbial \"cheery on top.\" Sure, it also has its share of cheesiness, but 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is a classic wild ride that does what it's supposed to do - entertain audiences.",

The relationship between the two is multi-layered and nuanced; although they work in the same field, they have different approaches, and yet are quite capable of working together. Alongside the Jones boys, we have Marcus Brody (played as a funny man by Denholm Elliott) and Dr. Elsa Schneider (played OK by Alison Doody). John Rhys-Davis returns as Sallah, and they are opposed by Walter Donovan (played with good depth of character by Walter Donovan).\n\nThe plot is both action-packed and generous with comedy; it feels very natural, and the scenes progress well with each other. There are twists, deeply fleshed-out characters, and a very satisfying finale.\n\nThe best entry in the series, and very much worth a watch.",

I'm happy to report however, the very opening shot of the Last Crusade, being almost identical to the opening shot of Raiders of the Lost Ark, announces a return to form for Steven Spielberg and the Indiana Jones franchise.\n\nAll the old elements are here from the first movie. Indiana Jones recovers an artifact, only to have it taken away after a great opening action sequence. Just like Raiders. Indiana's nemesis is a collector of rare antiquities and is working for - you guessed it, Hitler and the Nazis, who - you guested it, are searching for a ancient biblical artifact promising supreme power to its owner. Did George Lucas just recycle Raiders?\n\nThat strict adherence to the Raiders play book is actually one of the Last Crusades main weaknesses. Thankfully though, this third installment has plenty of surprises of its own. Thanks in no small measure to the addition of Sean Connery as Indy's father, Henry Jones. In the Last Crusade, we get to learn a lot more about Indiana Jones and his family. Indy's childhood is explored. What happened to his mother is revealed, and why he became estranged from his father. It's also great to watch Harrison Ford and Sean Connery work together. The dialog between the two is sharp and witty, and they play off each other perfectly.\n\nThe action in any Indiana Jones movie is always fun to watch, and the Last Crusade is no different. From the castle escape and chase, to the battle with a Mark VII tank and the Nazis. The action as usual is fun, inventive and exciting to watch. The visual effects in this movie are thankfully kept to a minimum, and are a little more polished this time around.\n\nFull review -> Movie prep -> Best Format -> Best Element -> http://talkiegazette.com/indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade-1989/\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette",

I mean really, can you think of any film trilogies where the third film is the best?  Very few, right?  Well, here is one right in front of you.  \"The Last Crusade\" is (at least in my opinion) the best of the Indiana Jones films, even topping the original \"Raiders\".\n\nThe reason this film is so great is because it feels a lot like \"Raiders\" and avoids the mistakes of \"The Temple of Doom\".  The Nazis are once again the villains - like \"Raiders\" - but the film keeps it fresh and doesn't feel like a repeat.  Also, the introduction of Sean Connery as Henry Jones, Sr. was a huge addition to the cast.  How great is it that they snagged Sean Connery?!  Harrison Ford and Sean Connery have great back-and-forth banter throughout the film.  This creates a lot of outstanding comedy, without taking away from the action.\n\nEven though \"The Last Crusade\" doesn't have that new Indy smell, Indy still kicks butt.  This film is a great conclusion for several reasons: it is fun, thrilling, and exciting; it has a great balance of comedy and action; and it gets back to the roots of what made \"Raiders\" great.  And so, as Indy rides off into the sunset, I feel this is the perfect ending for the series, and I'm glad the Indiana Jones series ends on a high note.  Oh wait...",

            "content": "After the dark silliness and extravaganza of 'Temple of Doom', 'The Last Crusade' is a triumphant return to form! It feels more in spirt and tone with 'Raiders' as Indy go searching for another ancient artifact whist punching Nazis. But what makes this sequel superior to the original is that it actually features a  personal story arc for Indy to actually develops his character and finds tremendous heart that is a cut above the death-defying stunts and riveting adventure sequences. You can tell from the film's flashback prologue that there is something more at work with this film as we see a Young Indy (played to perfection by the late River Phoenix) develop many of the daring archeologist's defining attributes. And director Steven Spielberg establishes a stunted paternal relationship with Indy and his study-obsessed father that this film will effectively explore. \n\n\nSome fans claim this is a messy retread of 'Raiders', but I honestly don't see that at all! No question, the film holds true to the formula of the series but this has a more complex story and excels with emotional depth that was lacking from the previous two movies. The real highlight of course is the relationship between Indy and his father, Henry Jones, played by the great Sean Connery. Connery gives a faultless performance that elevates both the film and Harrison Ford's committed turn wonderfully. You can argue that the Indy's new love interest, Elsa Schneider, is bland but their romance is somewhat brief and the twist with her character works very well for the story. Julian Glover's villain role may not be Indy's perfect foil like Belloq nor is he gleefully menacing as Mola Ram but he is dastardly enough to fill that villainous void. The action set pieces are quite impressive while not as innovative as its predecessors, However, the tank sequence is just as amazing as the Desert chase in 'Raiders' if only a bit more intricately choregraphed and once again heightened by John William's magnificent music score. It only get better as Indy is not only tested physically but mentally and emotionally as he faces three fearful challenges of wits to recover the Holy Grail. Not only is it furiously cinematic but its emotionally gripping!\n\n\nWhile 'The Last Crusade may lack some of that gritty charm of the original, but gives us a better story. That focus on Ford & Connery's Father/son dynamic makes this the stronger film of the two and THAT moment near the end where his father calls him \"Indiana\" solidifies that sentiment. Add on a gorgeous closing shot of our heroes off riding into the sunset, not only is this the absolute pinnacle of action/adventure cinema but a perfect sequel and flawless film that brings the Indiana Jones trilogy to a magnificent close! - 10/10 (A+)",
