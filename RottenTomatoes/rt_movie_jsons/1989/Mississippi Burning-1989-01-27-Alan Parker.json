    "summary": "When a group of civil rights workers goes missing in a small Mississippi town, FBI agents Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) and Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) are sent in to investigate. Local authorities refuse to cooperate with them, and the African American community is afraid to, precipitating a clash between the two agents over strategy. As the situation becomes more volatile, the direct approach is abandoned in favor of more aggressive, hard-line tactics.",

Not only do you have that great story, but you also have a good cop/bad cop story in the background and a lil bit of a love affair. There's a lot to unpack with this one. I found myself sort of identifying with Hackman lol as a character, just wish I had his cojones/hope I don't have the same turn-out as him. Good acting, great cinematography, score, pacing, just an all-around solid film. In any case, horrified of the ending and just makes u realize how awful our history was in America for so long.

This film is riveting from start to finish and, despite its running time of over two hours, there is not a single throwaway scene over its duration.  Hackman and Dafoe are fantastic, as is Frances McDormand as the wife of a thuggish police officer.

In 2020, it's a despondent take on how nothing ever really changes without a massive impetus, and how, if someone believes that their behavior will be supported by their community, someone will be willing to commit a host of sickening acts. The elements are all there for today's Republican party - \"real American\" patriotism beneath a sickening coat of good ol' boy shellac, shrieking in response to perception of media bias and persecution, culture under attack by \"outside influences\" that must be preserved, claimed violation of civil liberties when the right to suppress is challenged, and ironically massively anti-Christian sensibilities performed in the name of Christ. Tobolowsky as Bowers is virtually a blueprint for today's hyperconservative alt-right idiot figurehead: \"I love Mississippi. THEY hate Mississippi\". Dafoe and Hackman play off each other well in their (admittedly manufactured) contrasting roles. Incorporating visuals from the perspectives of victims and documentary-style snippets alike add to the narrative. The only real criticism from my end is narrative, given that the last half hour or so basically devolves into unrealistic (if satisfactory) revenge porn. Still, a well-made and prescient piece of film regarding race relations in America that is surprisingly unheralded given the fame of the two leads. (4/5)",

            "content": "Films that deal with race relations, particularly from the white perspective, have always been popular with the Academy but this film attracted more controversy than most for playing fast and loose with historical events and focusing on the torture of African-Americans through the eyes of white men. Unsurprisingly despite all of this controversy the film managed to rack up many nominations including one for Best Picture and while it lost to Rain Man (1988) it remains one of the best remembered films of the 1980s. I found a lot to appreciate in the film as it merges a crime thriller with a study of the attitudes of people living in small towns. No, I don't think the film is one of the five best of 1988 but it earns it's nomination more than Working Girl (1988) or Dangerous Liaisons (1988).\n\nTwo Jewish activists and one African-American are murdered by members of the Ku Klux Klan in Jessup County, Mississippi in 1964. Two FBI detectives, the idealistic and inexperienced Alan Ward, Willem Dafoe, and the hardnosed Rupert Anderson, Gene Hackman, who plays by his own rules, are brought in to investigate the murders. They encounter hostility from the locals who support the Klan and begin to suspect that Sherriff Clinton Pell, Brad Dourif, is affiliated with them and is helping to cover up their actions. In order to invalidate the alibi of Pell, Anderson decides to seduce his wife, Frances McDormand, to discover what he was really doing during the murders. The men also form a friendship and move beyond their differences as Ward allows Anderson to employ questionable methods in order to apprehend the men connected to the murders after Pell brutally beats his wife.\n\nThe strength of the film comes from the performances as Hackman is typically brilliant with his natural acting style fitting the tone of the film perfectly and his big showcase scenes really hitting all the right notes. One monologue that he delivers towards the beginning of the film in which he describes how his father murdered an African-American and told him about his reasons for hating black people allows us to see behind this man's fa\u00e7ade and understand what he is driven by. Dafoe is similarly able to imbue his character with a sense of decency as while we know he lacks experience and knowledge we believe that he has good intentions. He has the less showy role but he smartly stands back and lets Hackman chew the scenery while still displaying the tensions simmering just beneath the surface. The supporting players, Dourif and McDormand are convincing as Dourif's eyes are terrifyingly volatile and McDormand's quiet desperation is moving even if her accent work was a little off.\n\nParker's steady direction also helps the film along as he cuts between scenes of violence and the fevered investigation carried out by our two leads skillfully and has an eye for the small details that characterize this town expertly. Much like in Midnight Express (1978) he seems to have a steadier hand than the screenplay he is working with as the theatrics of Oliver Stone allowed for some odd moments in that film and here some of the more cringe inducing moments come from lines in Chris Gerolmo's screenplay. Perhaps the most unnecessary element of the film is the romance between Hackman and McDormand. I would have been happy to see them as friends united by their beliefs but the awkward turn into him bringing flowers to her and them making love were not moments I needed. This is not to say that Hackman and McDormand do not make their best effort to convince us of their romantic attraction but the film as a whole would have been better if this contrived relationship were adjusted.\n\nOther elements of the film that don't quite work include the score which sounds far too modern and the use of rock music in a film set in Mississippi in the 1960s seemed incongruous. Country music or a more orchestral score would have been more fitting and the scenes of violence would have been more effective as a score out of place with the rest of the film was distracting.\n\nFortunately minor flaws were not enough to bring down the whole film and I still took a lot away from the film while still enjoying myself.",

            "content": "A riveting crime thriller that feels shockingly relevant.\n\nMississippi Burning (1988) is directed by Alan Parker with a gritty realism and brutal violence that hits hard. This is a film so startling and infuriating that you will never forget it. It takes on the FBI investigation into the racist hate crimes of the KKK in 1960's America that feels as if this took place in present times, sadly.\n\nParker uses documentary style interviews with the backward racist Mississippi local characters to imbue the audience with a feel for how hateful and regressive the local population in the setting really are to their core. Parker pans the camera around the town constantly showing the average white community member with their distrustful glares and hateful venomous words. Mississippi Burning is a testament to persevering against adversity in the name of justice. No matter how violent and crooked the police and citizens get, the law can always get these criminals.\n\nParker invokes powerful imagery from the first shot of a white man and a black boy drinking from segregated water fountains whose water flows from the same pipe. Mississippi Burning longs for a peaceful country in which black communities will not be terrorized by racist white people. It is a demonstration of the fear tactics Republicans and klan members use to discourage black communities from voting or speaking out against these hate groups. \n\nMississippi Burning effectively displays the harsh and unkind truth that black communities in America constantly feel in danger and oppressed by their white neighbors. However ugly the reality of the situation, Parker captures all the pain and agony with a refreshing truth on camera. His direction is peerless as we see stunning cinematography of this Southern urban wasteland. \n\nParker offers profound reasoning for the hatred with dialogue mentioning the conditions of poverty and ignorance that teach hatred instead of it being born in white Americans.\n\nThe cast is as incredible as the overall film. Willem Dafoe presents the honest justice of the FBI trying to change the country's perception with law and order wonderfully. His resolute stance is so earnest and caring, you cannot help but like Dafoe in Mississippi Burning.\n\nOn the other hand, the gruff and macho Gene Hackman delivers an excellent performance as the more straightforward Southern tough guy. His depiction of a man conflicted by the racist viewings of his upbringing against his righteous attempts at uncovering evidence to convict the murderers is fascinating. Similarly, Frances McDormand gives a great acting performance as a hairdresser taught to be racist from birth that relents on her life choices. You almost feel sorry for her character. These three leading roles carry Mississippi Burning into cinematic greatness.\n\nThe supporting roles are a variety of hideous racist sheriffs like Gailard Sartain's negligent officer to the violently racist and abusive deputies like Brad Dourif's monstrous character. They are as unsettling as Michael Rooker's grotesquely racist character is vile. Lastly, R. Lee Ermey gives a fantastically furious performance as the racist and complacent mayor of this Mississippi town.\n\nI must mention Trevor Jones scored Mississippi Burning with tense synth heavy songs that leave you stuck in the scenes. His ear for how to build suspense is particularly outstanding during the chase sequences in the car.\n\nIn all, Mississippi Burning is a cinematic classic of creative visual direction from Alan Parker matched equally in brilliance by the high caliber acting from Willem Dafoe, Gene Hackman, and Frances McDormand. This movie will frighten, upset, enrage, and shock you. But I feel all the more informed and emboldened to progress America into a more tolerant, accepting, and understanding nation after having witnessed the nightmarish sight that is Mississippi Burning.",

Wow the whole opening is like poetry with the burning church and the water fountain and on top of that, to compliment it, the gospel music in the background. It's almost unbelievable how much unnecessary and ignorant hate there was towards a person who had darker skin. Already I can tell I'm going to be in one hell of a ride. \n\nI don't know why but seeing Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe almost seems to me like Peanut Butter and Jelly. Already I can tell Dafoe character is the straightedged one and Hackman's is the cynical and jokester one. It's crazy to think how ignorant these backwoods hillbilly redneck shit heads were back then. And some of them are still like that even to this day. \n\nIt seems like Gene's character doesn't really care about solving the case because to him, it's not going to make any difference since he knows people in Mississippi ain't going to change. There's still going to be ignorant blissful hate running through all those crackers. I love that quote Hackman says to the mayor, \"Baseball, it's the only time a black man can wave a stick at a white man, and not start a riot\", and then proceeds to wink and puts on his charm that we all know and love. \n\nDafoe's character is getting a bit too carried away with agents, he better be careful. Holy shit that saloon scene with that one ignorant white trash shit head was fucking brilliant. I got so much respect for Gene now that he choked that one guys balls out and left him red. It's so sad and also infuriating at the same time to see just how helpless black people were during that time in Mississippi. They couldn't speak up or else they get beaten up or worse. R. Lee Ermey is great in this movie. He popped in one of his great sayings in there. The injustice that's going in unbelievable. \n\nIt's so weird to see the guy that plays Jigsaw in the Saw movies as an FBI agent in this one. Amazing how they started busting everyone involved with the murders. I'm glad Redemption was met with a nice big prison sentence. Hope them steel bars taste nice when your taking it up the ass. \n\nQuite a powerful movie and will always be relevant. This is essential movie watching.",

And the makers in here, respects both the sides of the political aspects and walks on a fair and clear line. \n\nContrary to what premise promises or suggests, there is a lot more in here to explore than mere investigation procedure and no matter how rudimentary it may be, its metaphorical and satirical tone keeps the audience tangled in its pathos bubble. The background score may not be up front factoring the most, but it certainly has amazing cinematography and fine editing. \n\n\"The buddy cop\" chemistry should actually be like such and it defines it with such subtle panache that leaves long gasping of air whenever they are on screen. As mentioned, the performance is revelation in here where both the lead cast going head to head is one of the primary reason why stakes communicate fluently. \n\nHackman has genuinely invested all his chips in with Dafoe supporting him thoroughly and McDormand proving once again why she is one of the finest actress we have. Gerolmo's exquisite script is justified by Parker's execution skills where he leaves no barrs while conveying the message. \n\nThe inner politics brewed within the period depicted (the tables turning half way through the tale is not only unexpected but utterly pleasing to encounter too), Hackman and Dafoe sharing wisdom through funny bits and their performance that binds it all, are the high points of the feature. \n\nMississippi Burning is more than the genre could title it for, as it is essentially husky and cunningly crispy for the entire majestic two hours.",

Mississippi Burning winds the clocks back to 64 when those murders happened. The movie looks at the efforts of two FBI agents to find some measure of justice for the blacks in the south, but just like any task of this kind it is not easy.\n\tAlan Ward and Rupert Anderson are sent down from DC to Mississippi to investigate the disappearance of three civil right workers. Ward is a deadest no nonsense agent while Anderson is a bit of shady realist type agent who knows the south well. Ward and Anderson quickly find out how much the a small town in the state is on edge and how the KKK has installed fear in everyone, especially the blacks. This makes the investigation the agents came down for that much harder.\nits very real film about a time where everything was tense. Alan parker really captures mississipi well at this time. it was a real nightmare for blacks. I mean parker does a really great job of instilling a tenseness in the atmosphere of Mississippi. the racism in the state is so evident thanks to this. interesting how they applied the news broadcast elements into it as well with the interviews. adds a sense of realism to this ficitional story based on real events\ngene Hackman never seems to disappoint. Anderson knows the ways of this small town and yet makes it really unclear if he is trying to derail wards investigation or is trying to give him the right guidance in solving this murder. he played him as not only someone who jumps both sides of the fence but is fearless against the white supremiscts of the south. willem defoe plays an slightly idealistic and no nonsense man who doesn't know what he's messing with here in Mississippi. frances mcdormand was excellent here! I was worried she was gonna play a generic like character but this one was intriguing as she was one of the few townsfolk to actually sympathize with black folks and was fascinated by this rare attempt at order by the fbi agents\nI really liked the script for this film It was so nicely written. I liked the music too I was trying to find that main theme online but no luck. Anyway folks go check out Mississippi Burning",

You live it... you breathe it. You marry it.\"\n\nAlan Parker's 1988 film which was nominated for seven Academy Awards is another reminder of what a great career Gene Hackman had, although this time he got to share the spotlight with a pair of other wonderful performances from Willem Dafoe and Frances McDormand. The fact that Mississippi Burning isn't even considered one of Hackman's top ten most popular films just proves how many great films he's made over the span of five decades (he retired from acting in 2004). Since the film was loosely based on a real incident surrounding the disappearance of some civil rights workers in the south during the 60's many people complained that the film wasn't faithful to the story, but Parker never made such a claim and always said his film was a fictional tale of events that could've taken place during the time so I don't see any need to complain about it. Some similarities can be found with the classic film directed by Norman Jewison, In the Heat of the Night, which handles a similar theme about racism. Films like this are important reminders of how dangerous humans can be when they let hate and racism govern their hearts. It is so easy at times to forget those dark moments in our history and act like they never happened, but once in a while we get films like Mississippi Burning that remind us of the horrors of humanity and the sacrifice people made to end them. These are films with important messages which also happen to be well made and count with a stellar cast. Its only Oscar win was for Peter Biziou's wonderful cinematography, but there is so much more worth recommending about this classic from the 80's. \n\nThe film introduces us to three civil rights workers as they are detained by a police vehicle while they were about to exit a small Mississippi town. The officers begin making all sorts of hateful remarks towards these men and violently shoot them for trying to stir up their quiet and organized segregated town. A few days later, two FBI agents show up in town looking for these disappeared citizens, who they fear have been murdered. Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) is in charge of the operation despite his young age. His partner, Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), is more experienced and is not afraid to speak his mind about him as someone he believes to be well educated but lacking more field work. Ward likes to do things by the books, but Anderson who was a former Sheriff in a similar Mississippi town knows the mentality of these places and believes his methods won't get them anywhere in a place like this. The Mayor (R. Lee Ermey) isn't pleased with the agents visit because he believes his segregation methods work and that things are run differently here than in the south. The agents learn it quickly while they're trying to collaborate with the local officers. Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gaylord Sartain) is very protective of his boys, especially of Deputy Clinton (Brad Dourif) and officer Frank (Michael Rooker) who were the officers involved in the murder. It doesn't take the agents too long to realize what happened, but they can't find anyone in town who will speak to them since the victims have been threatened by the KKK. Every time someone seems to be interested in speaking up, they are immediately intimidated by the gang through violent acts. Ward's tactics don't seem to have an effect, but Anderson may have found the perfect ally in Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand), the Deputy's wife who rejects his actions. \n\nThe script handles the civil rights case with care and avoids falling into melodramatic territory by remaining gripping and suspenseful. There are plenty of thrills along the way and some violent scenes that are actually less horrifying than the hateful things these men say. It's true that the civil right theme is told through a white's man point of view, but I think it still remains compelling and well intentioned. In the end it becomes entirely a revenge action film, but it's handled in a convincing and realistic way. Hackman, Dafoe, and McDormand are in the center of the movie and they all deliver gripping performances playing off each other extremely well. Brad Dourif and Michael Rooker are given the stereotypical racist characters who are very easy to hate. Rooker seems to be playing the same character from The Walking Dead series only this time he actually acts upon his remarks more than simply being a loud mouth. Hackman and Dafoe are on the same side despite having very different approaches and that difference helps build the tension and relationships in the film. Parker's sensitive direction works in a film with such a controversial subject matter that could be easily manipulated. Mississippi Burning is a classic that shouldn't be missed by fans of Gene Hackman and his impressive career.          \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "I thought it was terrible. The whole point of the film is summed up in the last shot of a broken tombstone that reads \"1964 - not forgotten.\" Maybe they should have left this story buried. \n\nThe first hour of the movie put me in a real sour mood. Nothing but racist talk and violence. If you're a real racist you might actually get a kick out of this movie. There's no characters to like. Everyone acts in a stiff way and boring way to pull off the dumb redneck. Dafoe is very bland and a bit autistic, I think. A weird thing I noticed is that he sounds exactly like Agent Smith in The Matrix. He even wears a suit like Agent Smith. Hackman's name in the movie is Anderson and Dafoe says it like in The Matrix, like there's a period between each syllable of his name. The point of the appearance and speech pattern of Agent Smith was to show him as just a generic, unnoticeable nobody. Someone who would blend into a crowd. A faceless computer program. It was appropriate in The Matrix, but Dafoe's Agent Smith impression made the character distant and unreadable. He's dull, but at least he's a good man. Hackman's character made no sense to me. The way his character develops, he starts out racist enough, especially with all his black jokes, to not like him. He's also creepy around women. He seems like a redneck himself at times. But then half way through the film, for no real explained reason, the movie acts as if he was always a nice guy. Very weird. I still didn't like him. But at least he was the only person in the entire movie to give a lively performance. Also, I'm not use to seeing people behave this way in movies so the characters seemed very unfamiliar to me. It didn't elevate the cinematic experience, but if they were proper representations of people back then it's interesting and unpleasant.\n\nI didn't care for the other characters either because I didn't like them or I didn't know who they are. If I was black I don't think I'd feel empowered by this film. It's just a grim reminder of a past event. It's depressing. A young black boy is in it for a little bit. He doesn't do much, and then he's gone for the whole movie. Besides that boy, I hate to say it, but it felt to me like the black people in the movie were just props in a film about white people. The most glaring example is how through the movie were shown hate crime after hate crime, and after each crime things settle down and the movie resumes like nothing happen. But when Frances McDormand got beaten up that's when the CIA agents lose their cool and show a little emotion. Only when a white person gets hurt does the movie show a little enthusiasm to seek justice. Only that character is assigned any meaningful importance. And besides the black women singing at the end, who we don't know, the resolve of the movie is about Hackman and the woman talking. Is this a movie about blacks or women? Women's rights are important, but considering the context of the film I just thought it didn't celebrate justice for black people enough. If it wasn't for the excessive racist talk and violence toward blacks you'd forget this is a film about civil rights.\n\nWhat it reminded me of is a bad slasher movie. We know who the killers are right away and after that we just follow the detectives and listen to people be racist. With all the violence thrown in it's like a slasher movie where you know the killer right away and the rest of the movie is just uncreative and disgusting death scenes that grow on your nerves. Or like watching Faces of Death. What puts me off is how the movie doesn't pick a side. It's just telling the story. There's no emotion in the movie. Hackman gets mad when the woman is beat up. Dafoe is like an android. The only real emotion in the film is the rednecks anger towards blacks which just hangs in the air, meaningless and offensive, and the emotion you yourself put into it. The shocking hate crimes didn't make me emotional, it just made me disgusted. The movie was like watching a real video of whites beating up blacks. I wouldn't give a video like that 5 stars. \n\nI know this is based on a true story. My review is entirely about my experience with the movie and my criticism of the characterizations. As a movie it didn't work for me. Look at movies about WWII like Schindler's List and The Pianist. That's what this movie should have been like. The content of the story just isn't big enough to support the importance of the subject matter.\n\nThe second half of the film was better, but not by much. It's ruined by the first half, anyway. The only thing I liked about it the beginning with the three men getting killed. A very tense moment. At the beginning of a movie you don't expect flushed out characters so it works there. And the car chase scene was done well. The rednecks were driving away with a black man they were going to beat up, but Dafoe says not to follow until the cop goes back inside. That scene was good because you were thinking \"hurry up and go!!!\" The movie so reminded me of a horror movie I expected the car not to start.",

I'll give credit were credit is due: Hackman, Dafoe, and MacDormand play their parts well and there are several nail-biting scenes like the burning of the church, the opening car chase, and a black man dressing up as a klansman so he can kidnap and interrogate a backwards cop. But sadly, most of the antagonists and side characters are one-dimensional stereotypes, the music blares to let you know when a scene is important, and much of the plot feels repetitive instead of building to a climax. I've seen a lot of documentaries cover this material better as well as \"12 Years a Slave\" and \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" Go check those out.",

            "content": "An acclaimed film back in 1988, Mississippi Burning still shines and is capable of striking a chord within you on your feelings and views on racism. With remarkable performances, aggressive direction and a cracking pace, this is superb cinema, even if the historical accuracy leaves much to be desired. Slick, well-acted thriller that nonetheless distorts the facts and looks at the civil rights movement from a strictly white perspective. Parker pushes the picture along at a fervent clip, with the character scenes back-to-back with chases or violence. The music in Mississippi Burnin is phenomenal; there are a lot of gospel songs for example the song by Vesta Williams '' Try Jesus ''. There is also a tune in the film when something bad is about to happen, when you hear it for the first time in the movie recognize the tune immediately, when you hear it you feel uncomfortable and are at the tip of your seat. The movie knows to capture the right atmosphere for a movie with such a theme like this one has. It means that the movie has some effective cinematography and picked some good settings. Its strength is that whilst dramatizing the hot bed of racism in the 60s it still manages to deliver an entertaining storyline which means you want to watch and when you want to watch you take it all in. The performances were great, Hackman, Dafoe and McDormand shine, as well as the rest of the supporting cast. Alan Parker's direction is superb in this film, making the rest fall into place and coming up with big results.\n\nVERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",

            "content": "I think in this review of \"Mississippi Burning,\" I need to be careful on what to say about it. To start off, it was well done and well made within its horrific atmosphere. The best of the picture next to karmas was the performances of Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe at their best. Their chemistry is quite similar to the chemistry between Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman in \"All the President's Men\" when investigating for answers without receiving any cooperation but threats instead.\n\nSo to sum it up: \"Mississippi Burning\" is a well-done, brave dramatization with a horrific atmosphere, and the performances of its main duo lightens things up as they crack the corrupted Mississippi to sweat and weaken. (B+)\n\nIf you want to read more of the review, read further to get to the truth that's based on my opinion.\n\nWhat makes this a brave dramatization directed by Alan Parker was the portrayal on how monstrous the white people were (*are if there are still some disgracing the race) at that time of the unreasonable segregation. My blood boils whenever I see a monstrous white mistreating, disrespecting and hurting an innocent a black person who doesn't deserve that.\n\nTo describe my daydreaming thoughts when I was watching this movie, I was imagining myself as Christopher Nolan's Batman protecting the black people and anyone from harm from monsters as the world is Gotham City and Mississippi is Arkham.\n\n Now you see why I need to be careful on what I write or I'll probably be threatened like how Hackman's and Dafoe's characters were when they were digging deep into the mystery of the disappearance of three civil-rights workers. The investigation was pleasantly causing the monstrous whites to sweat from their skull(?), and weak enough to show that they're truly brainless monsters with no respect and that we're right about them being that way at that time whereas for unknown reason they'd turned into lazy chickens and started disrespecting the black people. Oops, this rebellious, expressionist white has said it already.\n\nLast year with the releases of \"42,\" \"The Butler,\" \"Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom\" and the 2014 Best Picture winner \"12 Years a Slave,\" I think I came across on an article that was about that the white people want these kind of productions to stop portraying their race as monsters. What I need to say about that is that these kind of movies were showing the world the truth dramatized. So it seems that the white people were getting shamed by what they've become and were given karma for what they've done (pretty sure karmas were given individually that's more than what the dramatizations were telling). So it seems that they've gave up when the truth was dramatized times before. It also seems that they want the truth buried so they can be forgiven and the past to be forgotten. (The whites I'm talking about are the monstrous ones in that era).",

            "content": "After three civil rights workers in Mississippi are reported missing in 1964, two FBI agents are sent to investigate the incident in rural Jessup County, Mississippi. The two agents take completely different approaches: Agent Alan Ward (Dafoe), a young liberal northerner, takes a direct approach to the investigation; Agent Rupert Anderson (Hackman), a former Mississippi sheriff who understands the intricacies of race relations in the South, takes a more subtle tack. It is very hard for the two to work in the town, as the local sheriff's office is linked to a major branch of the Ku Klux Klan, and the agents cannot talk to the local black community, due to their fear of Klan retaliation. Slowly but steadily, relations between the FBI and the local Jessup County sheriff's office deteriorate, as do relations between Ward and Anderson. Things boil over when the bodies are found and the deputy sheriff, Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif), realizes that his wife gave their locations to Anderson, and he assaults her. When Anderson sees her in the hospital, he storms off to confront Pell but is stopped by Ward. After a violent fight and battle of wills, the two agree that they will work together to bring down the Jessup County branch of the Ku Klux Klan using Anderson's as yet untried approach...\n\nThis is a strong and very difficult film from Alan Parker with specifically Gene Hackman in a fantastic form. The dynamics between Ward and Anderson and their strong will to do whatever it takes to bring down the guilty (even if they want to do it in different ways) and with a truly terrible backdrop of racism in the 60s makes an emotional film that will stay with you forever. I had forgotten some parts of it from since I saw \"Mississippi Burning\" at the movies in 1988, but all the difficult scenes were vivid in my mind. I reckon \"Mississippi Burning\" should be shown for everyone to get a grip of the terrible act of racism. A topic that is still way too current today. Despite the criticism of not being entirely accurate storywise the message it is still very strong and to the point.",

Gene Hackman gives another knockout performance here, as he does always as does Willem Dafoe. The cast is great, though Gailard Sartain was a surprising choice as Sheriff Stuckey, given his penchant for appearing in the worst of films. It is based on a true story, about the murder of three civil rights activists. True stories are never presented to perfection. It is, however, presented as well as it can be. This is a very gripping, edge of your seat film and very well done.",

I know it's not a subject matter that some may feel is relevant today, but it's still a very powerful piece of cinema and deserves recognition for that, if nothing else. Here's a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts.\n\nWhen three civil rights activists go missing in a small town in Mississippi in 1964, the FBI is called in to investigate. In charge is the younger Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) with the much older and wiser Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) in tow. Having got short shrift from the local sheriff, Ray Stuckley (Gailard Sartain), Ward tries to speak to some of the black residents of the town, this does not go down well and results in those he had spoken to being beaten for their trouble. Eventually the car the missing men had been driving is found and Ward brings in more men, a lot of them. Suspicion falls on Deputy Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif), but he has the whole town covering for him, including his wife (Frances McDormand). Anderson befriends her but she will not budge on her story. It seems the whole town is scared of the KKK, but nobody wants to speak about it. Eventually though they get a break and Ward reluctantly agrees to use Anderson's somewhat cavalier methods. Does it pay off? Well I guess that would be a spoiler now wouldn't it.\n\nAlthough based on real events, the filmmakers go to great lengths to make it clear that this is a work of fiction. As such it works very well; it is a very powerful drama that puts the fight for civil rights to the fore. I must say I found it quite thought provoking, very well made and really well shot. The performances were all excellent with (for me), Gene Hackman standing out; although I thought Willem Dafoe was very good and Brad Dourif was excellent as the loathsome Deputy Pell. I also have to mention a couple of small roles; it was nice to see both Stephen Tobolowsky as Clayton Townley and R. Lee Ermey as Mayor Tilman; I know they didn't have an awful lot to do, but they were both quality. Over all, an interesting drama that kept me interested all the way through - a definite 'must' for any cinephile.\n\nSteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n\nMy score: 8.7/10.\n\n\n\nThere are extra bits & pieces (photos, links, trailer and BIGGER PRINT) on my blog at:\nhttp://thoughtsofasteelmonster.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/film-review-mississippi-burning-1988.html\n\nEnjoy!... :)",

That may be a perfect representation of how we all feel about the damage these real events caused for humanity but it does make this film hard to appreciate beyond the unrelenting darkness and haunting flames.\n\nThe visceral violence takes precedence here and while that is understandable, I was waiting for a moment for the victims to have their say- that moment never came. Hackman and Dafoe are left to deal with the issues here but that wasn't enough for me-  there's a faith that is lost in Dafoe's character here and I understand that completely but what about those who suffered the most, the victims of these terrible tragedies, had they lost hope too? I'm not given an answer and without it I can't say that this moved me- it got to me, of course it did, but beyond the violence and the hatred and loss of hope there was nothing that showed the strength in humanity that would prevail- this is more than a police drama, it should be, it needs to be and yet its not- its \"edgy\"  if you'll forgive such a vague statement but its not the analysis that I wanted- it gives us the description but there's more to this story, most importantly, there is something to take beyond the misery and fear. Instead of showing that we  are left with a misplaced love story and some very-general crime drama characteristics. I simply wanted this to be more, whether that's fair of me or not I do not know but its how I feel.\n\nThe performances are great and there's some very memorable scenes also as well as a great job from Parker all-round really. All of my criticisms have been addressed above- the rest is as good as it could be.",

Films shouldn't be nominated or awarded if they are \"whats new and talked about right now\" or if an actor may be \"due up\" for an award. Francis McDormand and Hackman were outstanding but it gets me down when my favorite actor Dafoe gets out-shined, looks out of place, or doesn't live up to expectations. Mississippi Burning is another example of a page in our history books being retold in inaccurate, exaggerated Hollywood form. \n\n2/5",

It's a gripping and heavy going expose on one of the darkest hours of America's recent history, and one which should never happen again. It's got a brilliant cast and Parker captures the era well. In Jessup County, Mississippi in 1964, three civil rights workers are murdered by a group of bigots, they were detained by the police then released before they were pounced upon. The FBI send two agents to investigate the crime, Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe). Anderson was a sheriff in Mississippi years earlier, and knows too well of the prejudices people have, while Ward is a liberal and is very direct. They first interview Deputy Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif), who both agents believe had a hand in the murders. But when the local Ku Klux Klan threaten the agents, they call for back-up of 100 agents. Meanwhile, Anderson gets information from Pell's wife (Frances McDormand), who has been told to keep quiet about what really happened. It's a powerful and shocking crime mystery, you can't believe people were like this towards blacks and indeed other races in that part of America, and there's still a small minority who hold on to such beliefs. Parker gets the best from his cast, and his crew (all from England) bring Mississippi of the 1960's back to vivid life.",
