    "summary": "Judah (Martin Landau) is a philandering eye doctor who wants to preserve his marriage, and his dangerous brother Jack (Jerry Orbach) comes up with what appears to be the only viable solution. Certain that his mistress (Anjelica Huston) is about to tell his wife (Claire Bloom) about his affair, Judah agrees to Jack's murderous plan. Twinned with Judah's tale is that of Cliff Stern (Woody Allen), a documentary filmmaker whose problems, which involve love and art, are tame but funny.",

            "content": "The 80s were arguably Woody Allen's most creative decade, consistently pumping out quality films, including the likes of Hannah and Her Sisters, Broadway Danny Rose, Zelig, The Purple Rose of Cairo, and, to cap the decade off, Crimes and Misdemeanors.  The latter film, which continues his exploration of existential angst, brings to light the fact that good is not always rewarded and evil is not always punished.  As with most of his movies, the cast is stellar (Alan Alda, Martin Landau, Anjelica Huston, Mia Farrow, and more), the writing is brilliant, and Allen's direction, as always, is thoughtful and well-staged.  While Crimes and Misdemeanors may not be his best film, it is certainly close to the top of the list.",

            "content": "Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) offers perhaps the most complex study of the relationship between film and reality in all of Woody Allen's work, not excepting the lighter treatment of the theme in The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985). In Crimes and Misdemeanors, film and reality interact on multiple levels ranging from the commercial to the philosophical. They also interact through a blend of genres that includes the noir crime drama, romantic comedy, social satire, and the documentary. Along the way the film enthusiast is treated to a dazzling variety of interwoven film clips from Hollywood genre films, darkly humorous newsreel footage of a blustering Mussolini, and arresting talking head interviews with fictional philosopher Louis Levy (played by Martin S. Bergmann, the renowned clinical psychologist and author of The Anatomy of Loving). Allen uses these film-within-film conceits to dramatize a central Dostoevskian (and 20th century) theme: the consequences of a god- absent universe. ",

            "content": "Sam Waterston ... as an NYC criminal? My days of watching Law & Order on daytime TV cry out in agony!\n\nA blending of deeply introspective themes from classical literature (particularly Dostoevsky and his classic, 'Crime and Punishment') with Woody Allen's neurotic mannerisms, Crimes and Misdemeanors is a stylistic shift from the comic writer-director's earlier work, focusing more prominently on its moral commentary than on including frequent jokes. It's certainly in your face as to its intentions - casting comparisons between the struggles of the relatively upright Cliff Stern (Allen) and the commercial and personal successes of both Landau's Judah (an outwardly refined physician who eventually agrees to have his mistress murdered to preserve his lifestyle and public image) and Alda's Lester (a pseudo-intellectual and skeezy show business professional with a base perspective on entertainment and the big office to show for it). In the contrast with the latter, there are more shades of traditional Allen screenplays - Cliff fretfully tries to pursue cinematic artistry but finds himself unemployed and losing his love interest to a tone-deaf and slightly oafish Lester with funny remarks galore (Alda plays the character particularly well); in the case of Judah, the same themes are revisited with much darker implications, including the loss of a human life for another's peace of mind, and the ultimate preservation of Judah's mental stability despite his terrible act and initial devastation. It's an interesting duality that's presented, a tackling of the same social trend (the lack of morality/sincerity ultimately paying off in modern society) in two contrasting ways.\n\nNow, the film certainly his distinctiveness from the prior films in Allen's filmography, but its tougher texture does make it a bit more difficult to swallow; more somber, less outwardly enjoyable. Still strong and entertaining, but be warned that it's not the director's typical rapid-paced joke parade, instead it's a bit of a genre extension. (3.5/5)",

            "content": "This is the 6th Woody Allen film I've watched and I have to say it is the one I liked the most so far (Annie Hall and Manhattan were among the other five so a high bar was set). It is curious how I believe I have not seen any trully happy couples in any of his films but, in a way, almost all of them talked about love and relationships. In Crimes and Misdemeanors the usual analysis of individuals and their interaction with each other is combined with a slightly more traditional plot, which at moments even brought the taste of a thriller. The great Woody Allen sense of humor is here as usual, the characters are really well built, the creative directing is also present and the flow of the movie is once again a big highlight.\u2028The film centers on two characters, Judah and Cliff. Judah is a successful physician who has a perfect life on the surface but has been losing his sleep as Dolores, his mistress, is not dealing well with their break up. He seems to still have feelings for her but his fear of damaging his prestige as a high-society righteous man with the perfect family seems to speak louder. He is lost and anxious through most of the film and you can feel that on your skin. After he finds a way to deal with his situation, a new internal conflict arises, bringing up feelings about religion and the existence of God. The constrast between the two main characters starts with the fact that Cliff is an unsuccessful documentary director who has a marriage on the verge of its end. He too is finding comfort and love with someone other than his wife but in this case it is only starting and possibly won't even materialize.\u2028The two stories evolve together but meet only in the end, in a very smooth way. More than trying to get any morals or messages in all of these imperfect relationships, I believe what is that it was mostly a really well built film that grabs your attention 100% of the time. Woody leaves his print at several points. First in the great sections of other movies illustrating similarities with the story being told. Also in the scene of Judah talking to the human representation of his conscience, which is just outstanding. Finally, in the excerpts from speeches of a philosopher being studied by Cliff, which fit perfectly by describing the complex relationships of life, love and religion.\u2028The story is funny at some points and intense in others, he directing adds a perfect rhythm to it and the deepness of feelings and relationships just makes you think about the movie several hours after it is over.",

            "content": "Sometimes Woody Allen is capable of balancing his wry but zany sense of humor with very dark subject matter. This is possibly the most notable example as he grapples with questions about morality and faith usually only explored with depth by Russian novelists and playwrights. It is no surprise that this is considered one of his best films as it shows him actually committing to telling a dark and tragic tale and following it through to it's disheartening and bitter ending. This film does not have the issues that Allen's weaker films do as it doesn't just feel like a group of relatively funny jokes with a vague plot fashioned around them.\n\nRespected ophthalmologist Judah Rosenthal, Martin Landau, is viewed as a good man by his devoted wife Miriam, Claire Bloom, and the various members of his wealthy social circle. His position in society and relationship is threatened when his mistress of two years, air hostess Dolores Paley, Anjelica Huston, decides that she wants to reveal their affair to his wife and have them discuss who he will choose to be with going forward. He wants to end their affair as she becomes increasingly clingy and threatens to reveal details about questionable financial dealings he made in the past while he believes revealing the affair would permanently damage his relationship with his wife. When pushed he has his brother Jack, Jerry Orbach, use his connections to the mafia to have her murdered and feels a great deal of guilt afterwards but his crime is not discovered and is misattributed to a drifter who committed other crimes. Meanwhile documentary director Cliff Stern, Woody Allen, mocks his brother-in-law, shallow television executive Lester, Alan Alda, when hired to direct a documentary about him while chasing Lester's employee Halley Reed, Mia Farrow, despite being married.\n\nThe film is famous for it's ending which refutes Dostoyevsky's \u2018Crime and Punishment' by stating that somebody can get away with murder and continue to live as a normal, happy person who is not destroyed by their guilt. This is a horrifying thought as we want to believe that human morality is somehow intrinsic and any person who is not \u2018insane' understands that killing somebody for their own gain and facing no punishment for it is unthinkable. We feel sympathy for a reprehensible man in this film because he goes through the motions of feeling guilt and even has a born again moment but he makes no real attempt to atone for his sins and is able to continue living his life as a man loved by all around him. He is not weighed down by the thought of this woman losing her life as a result of his selfish desires and does not value honesty and real emotion in the relationships he has with his wife and the people who look up to him.\n\nAll of this is complemented by the character of Stern's other brother-in-law rabbi Ben, Sam Waterston, who is a morally pure man but faces punishment in the form of loss of his sight. Seeing the example of a man who encouraged him to do the right thing facing a permanent disability may have encouraged Rosenthal to continue going down his immoral path as he will not be rewarded for good deeds and if he does the right thing he may be doubly punished. Allen plays with our minds cleverly in this film as we expect Rosenthal to get caught as almost every man or woman who commits a \u2018perfect murder' in a film noir does but the simultaneous emptiness and relief of not getting caught does not cause him pain but allows him to move on with his life.\n\nHe also smartly lets us come to care about Paley before she is murdered as flashbacks to the beginning of their relationship have a hopefulness to them that makes her inevitable murder emotionally devastating. Landau and Huston have a convincing chemistry as they run along the beach together and discuss his sexual prowess and for a moment you begin to believe that they really could make it together. Then we jump back to the present and see how it has all come crashing down and it is disheartening to see a man destroy the dreams of a mistress he has clearly been leading on while seeming self pitying and smug. His editor Susan E. Morse deserves most of the credit for this as she drops these flashbacks in without disrupting the flow of the film and adds important subtext to other scenes.",

He just can't help it. And you cannot hate that about him. It is simply inspirational and adorable. The writer and director Woody Allen is one romantic fellow. He can and does romanticize the idea of murdering someone. That foreplay of God that he imparts on us as wisdom and practicality that zaps you like a lightning bolt, is his version of making sense out of a narration. And no one writes like him. So what if there is a character similar to him, always, running around the screen. No one has produced these many avant-garde ideas so exceptionally and convincingly that his filmography starts calling itself out for a specific taste.\n\nA sense of humor is a second thing, the sense of romance should be your priority when you jump in on his train of thought. There is an incoherent rush through the film. Either accelerated by subtle humor or self-mockery or intense drama or plot moving forward with an incredible pace. Either way, the film keeps you at the edge of your toe, instead of being calm and present. It is present for it thinks a lot.\n\nEach character is told to decide repetitively on the screen. Which makes you, the viewer, understand, empathize and even nod to the decisions they would go for or lead towards. By then, it wouldn't matter what they choose to do or be. The journey, the pain, the pressure that they make \"punish\" themselves with redeems their credit points in front of our eyes. It is a story that is far from gangster genre no matter how familiar their action grows. Crimes And Misdemeanors also gets the \"close calls\" right and like no one. What they do, what he has done, is that he didn't keep any.",

But I do not fault the film for only having an untruthful philosophical message, I also in general found it to be a rather paltry Allen film besides its pretentious facade. I's generally unfunny and not involving dramatically. All of the characters are either despicable or pathetic, and all of Allen's most grating tendencies are not diluted here. I believe the majority of people who give this film a high rating enjoy it for the questions it asks and the \"wise\" sounding conclusions it reaches, but as someone who's very focused on philosophy I found its posturing dull and hollow.",

This is the best performance I have seen from Huston and even though she did deservingly earn an Oscar nomination for Enemies, a Love Story that same year (1989), I think this performance would have been more deserving to be nominated for if not both. It's well written like most of Allen's films and has a great capture of New York City like most of Allen's films.",

It's Hitchcock meets Woody Allen, with all of Allen's trademarks; once again marrying the dissection of urban Manhattan's inhabitants with an arsenal of lampooning dialogue. Shifting the mood from dark to comedic to social satire with seamless aplomb, Crimes and Misdemeanors is a sophisticated, ambitious, dark meditation on murder and guilt that still manages to be uproariously funny.",

The whole murder plot was put together great and all of the characters put in a great performance. It isn't a whodunit, like Manhattan Murder Mystery, but it shows how a simple affair can turn horribly wrong. Woody Allen didn't have to include the love affair between him and Mia Farrow, but it does lighten the movie, even though it doesn't end to well for his character. It does feel like two completely different movies in one, which is why the title fits the film perfectly. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nMartin Landau was brilliant in this film. He brought intensity and emotion to his role which made the whole situation between him and Huston believable. Alan Ada and Mia Farrow act the same in all of Woody Allen's movies so there performances wasn't that surprising, and I much preferred the toned down version of Woody Allen's acting which made the film bearable. Anyway, this is a watchable movie which shows that Woody Allen can write and direct other genres except for comedy.\n\nBudget: $19million\nWorldwide Gross: $18.2million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies about a man who tries to break an affair and a struggling director who falls in love with a co-worker. 6/10",

But none have been great, like Crimes and Misdemeanors. The Woody Allen scenes were consistently hilarious, crammed with witty one liners, and priceless moments. My favorite is when Woody Allen shows the final product for the documentary he's been making for and about his smug brother in law, in which he clips in a roaring Mussolini. Which is another unique aspect this film accomplished, in it's modern recreations of black and white movies, showing clips of the scene getting recreated moments after-usually at a theater. \n\nThe more dramatic Martin Landua plot didn't put me in a solemn mood, that Woody Allen was trying to create. This is the one aspect of this film that didn't get accomplished in my viewing experience. The dilemmas were gripping, and the spiritual flashbacks were intriguing, but I lacked empathy in these scenes. I even felt more towards Woody Allen in his envy towards his brother-in-law, and his desire for Halley (Mia Farrow). Both stories cover a different stage of an affair, with much different results, and begs the question of which one got it better.\n\nThe film editing is stellar, done by Susan E Morose, and Woody Allen directs another awesome comedy",

In this film, its main concern is the struggle within, the general moral conscience Vs. the guilt or the sin, and out of left field, it is the latter eventually prevails, with the trappings of a comfortable life, the murder becomes a petty snippet in his memory and time can put everything back into an equilibrium, it is beyond any religion's absolution. Landau delivers one of his best performances in his lengthy career, an outright leading role (again, shamefully the category fraud push him into supporting group in the Oscar race), a hypocrite sleekly justifies his selfish and heinous behaviors with superfluous paddings, a despicable person so full of life with mocking caricature and a tint of self-reflection, everyone has his or her own unsurmountable hurdle in reality, luckily the preponderance is able to rein the yardstick. Anjelica Huston breaks her lofty stereotype, to overplay an unreasonable mistress who is too desperate to shore up her wanting sense of security, as vexing and halfwitted as she is, her denouement is too much a punishment. \n\nAs for Allen's romantic entwinement with Farrow and his doomed marriage, it brims with casual wisecracks and addicted cinema-goings, but the scene-stealer is Alda, whose character is blatantly based on the late writer Larry Gelbart, utters bon mots like, comedy is tragedy plus time; or if it bends, it's funny, if it breaks, it isn't. He is snobbish and lewd to everyone's eyes, yet he walks off with Allen's soul mate. Woody Allen is rehashing the same old self, and Mia Farrow refrains herself as an out-of-his-league dame, who speaks highly about her unrealized ambition in order to reject a man trapped in a dead wedlock, yet subservient to the mogul's courtship, it all boils down to the point of a woman's self-deceptive blindness towards material needs, with a collateral damage to her unsuccessful suitor. So in both stories, the female characters are less glamorous and adorable here, not to mention Allen's sister's icky sex encounter in the bedroom. \n\nThe film is mostly brisk under the accompany of a jazzy score, and its debate on moral structure is a cogent one and could be a reference to all the contemporary marital or relationship mishaps, even the religious mumble-jumble has an epiphany on those non-believers.",
