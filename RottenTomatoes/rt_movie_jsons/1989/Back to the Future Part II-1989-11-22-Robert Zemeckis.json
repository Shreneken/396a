Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) return from saving Marty's future son from disaster, only to discover their own time transformed. In this nightmarish version of Hill Valley, Marty's father has been murdered and Biff Tannen, Marty's nemesis, has profited. After uncovering the secret to Biff's success -- a sports almanac from the future -- Marty and the Doc embark on a quest to repair the space-time continuum.",

The plot twists and turns in unexpected ways, and the futuristic world it creates is both imaginative and thrilling. The performances of the cast, particularly Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, are as charming and engaging as ever. While some of the special effects may feel a bit dated by today's standards, they still manage to hold up and add to the overall excitement of the film. Overall, Back to the Future 2 is a fun and entertaining ride that any fan of the original movie or sci-fi genre should not miss.",

The visuals are breathtaking, and Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are as good as ever.  I really love the scenery of the Alternate 1985, in which Hill Valley looks like living he**.  Thomas F. Wilson does a really good job at potraying Biff, as he always has, but the acting of Griff, Biff's grandson, really jumped the shark, and was quite whiny, if you ask me.  The depiction of the future looks more like 2085 instead of 2015, if you ask me, but it was done really well.  \"Back To The Future: Part II\" should leave you going 88 MPH in your seat! \"Burn the book!\".",

The plot is much more complex in this but its told in a very surprisingly easy to follow expose light way. The special effect are very well done and most hold up very well besides a bit of blue screen that looks shotty. The music is very well done in this with a slightly different version of the originals songs and some new ones that aren't as catchy but still very good. The cinematography and acting all are very well done except they have one handicap in that a the set design and acting can come off sometimes as over the top rather than comedic and funny. It makes the future setting where most of this happens very dated in a sense. If it would have been more subtle acting and less over the top set designs particularly in the 2015 setting than this would have been on par with the first if not better even. Anyone who really loved the first should give this a watch. It's a Classic Sci-Fi Comedy Adventure with minor flaws.",

That being said, Part II goes further with the timeline — both to 1955 and 2015 — and is intricate where it could've been lazy. In fact, some of the most iconic moments in the franchise come from Part II, including the hover-board, which really is fantastic, the Cubs winning the 2015 World Series, and the concept that if you went back in time, you could become rich simply by placing bets on sporting events. Sometimes, the acting and the switching timelines could be… a little much. I especially enjoyed Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) as the Trump-like figure in the dystopian future. Where the movie excels is posing — and then answering — the question of \"Where would my life be, if just XYZ went differently?\" I was disappointed in the lack of time we seemed to spend with Doc (Christopher Lloyd) in this one. Perhaps he had just as much screen-time as the first (or more), but he felt like an ancillary character here. Part II is a solid second installment for the Back to the Future franchise, even if it lost some of the luster from the original.",

            "content": "\"Back to the Future 2\" is the best sequel in the history of cinema! The best series of the trilogy, and probably the most iconic film of my childhood. Robert Zimekis and Bob Gale did an excellent job of closing the opening ending of the first film in the most effective way with their two (filmed at the same time) sequels. \"Back to the Future 2\" does the impossible, it reimagines the iconic and just perfect original.\n\nAll my favorite movie moments happen at the very beginning of the movie. The future shown in \"Back to the Future 2\" is probably the most beautiful and wonderful of all shown in the films. The future reminds me of the improved and enlightened 80s with flying cars and with the technical revolution at its maximum. It is shown not as depressive, as we say in Blade Runner or A Clockwork Orange, but as positive and cheerful.\n\nThese 20 minutes of Marty McFly's future adventure (not counting the scenes at Jennifer's house) is just one mind-blowing movie moment. Seriously, everything looks so great, I would give anything to be in such a future, walk along this Hill Valley, go to the 80's Cafe, have a glass of P-Perfect and fly around the city in a car time.\n\nThe general mood of the \"bad\" 1985 is filmed very well, the city resembles one of the largest and most criminal districts in the United States. The ending is no less interesting, the connection with the first series, it becomes possible to look, so to speak, into the cut scenes of the first film and look at the story from a different angle. The final scene is also unique, Thomas F. Wilson plays wonderfully. Beff is probably the best school bull ever shown in the movie.\n\n\"Back to the Future\" trilogy (and especially the first 2 series) is like one big and most important film of my childhood. I remember for the first time I watched the first and second parts, probably somewhere in 1991, while still in kindergarten. These 2 films shocked me so much that even today, after many years, I can watch them endlessly, and they don't bother me. One thing is clear, unfortunately, no one will shoot anything like this. all new sci-fi blockbusters look nothing compared to the Back to the Future trilogy.\n\n10 out of 10",

Marty is able to foil the gang lead by Griff (a descendant of Biff) and thus prevent his future son from being jailed, but before he goes back he tries to smuggle a Sports Almanac back with him before Doc intervenes, but Biff who is an old man and seemingly perplexed by seeing the duo and their time traveling DeLorean, sets out to change the future for himself and his future descendants using the Almanac.

It nods to Jaws 3 in a sense in one cool 3D visual scene and honestly this is better then Jaws 3. It ends with a really fun teaser for the next and latest installment too. Comedy continues here well and same with the visual effects and storytelling. 1 had good storytelling besides the part I felt was out of place and this does too. 4 out of 5.",

If we look at the criteria for what makes a good sequel, it definitely expands the universe of the first film in original and creative ways by showing the future instead of the past, it continues the story in a fine and acceptable way, however, it doesn't introduce new themes or leave an undeniable impact on the franchise, it's a fine sequel in that regard. Now if we look at the movie on its own, the dynamic between Doctor Brown and Marty Mcfly is just as enjoyable as before and hasn't changed one bit, the plot isn't as creative as the original but still manages to get us hooked. The pacing however is one thing this movie pulls off wonderfully, just like its predecessor! Not one moment is boring or uninspiring, There's always a fun and quirky scene that sucks us straight into the action! Unfortunately, the special effects, while revolutionary back then, have aged rather poorly, especially the Jaws projection. Another thing I definitely don't like about this movie is how it feels like its desperately trying to squeeze out a final installment, this definitely hampered the final product as it was more focussed on making more sequels while they were at it. While fine, Back to the Future II could've been so much more if it hadn't played it safe and went all out just like the original...",

Fox having fun playing future versions of Marty McFly and his son (though why he also plays his daughter is ridiculous).  The scene stealer this time is Tom Wilson, playing various versions of Biff with equal abomb, entertaining even when he is the most cruel.  Behind the camera, writer/director Robert Zemekus crafts a true sequel to the movie, picking up where the original left off, but is hit or miss throughout.  The first act is the worst, with some horribly dated depictions of the future 2015, while the second act of the new 'present' picks up a bit.  However, it is the third act where things pick up and what the movie is really known for, as Marty and Doc must journey back to 1955 to make sure the future turns out like it should.  The film expertly weaves the current and past films together, really playing up the time travel angle and showing how complicated things can get.  While it isn't perfect, it sure ends great, and leads into a much better sequel.",

The promotion of Biff from normal antagonist to this cartoonish level of scene-chewing villainy was an unwelcome one to me and I felt there were other directions they could easily have taken the franchise instead. They seemed to delve even deeper into the criticized materialism of the first movie even just by insisting Marty permanently change history through time travel only to keep his own kid out of jail. This series is surely the biggest of all time in the category of having the entire plot revolve around purely selfish objectives. Silvestri's score seemed to always be teetering on the edge between being very, very grandiose and being really invasive and distracting.

The alternate 1985 was a wonderful idea, but the REAL magic is the return to 1955 with two Doc's and two Marty's.

They incorporated, current present, future, new present & past, making the narrative uneven, with a lot of tone shifts.\n\nMichael J. Fox puts on another great performance, with his character being more than occupied. Marty is more matured this time around, other than his hilarious, unexplained anger issues. Doc is the same ol' doc, being energetic, yet super witty, just not getting enough screen time he deserves. We also got another dose of Thomas F. Wilson as Biff. Biff was all over this film, being just as active as Marty, and maybe even more than Doc. Even though his character isn't the most creative, he is a very talented actor, being able to play all these roles, in one film, and staying consistent.\n\nThe screenplay by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale again, brought the same witty, and humorous dialogue, while incorporating a few familiar lines.\n\nThe production design by Rick Carter was beautifully displayed. Carter had a lot on his plate, to perfect all these unique settings, and he completed the task with flying colors. The special effects were heavily relied on in this film, but were done very well.\n\nOverall, Back to the Future Part 2, may not have been the breath of fresh air the first installment was, but it was still loads of fun, expanding on this creative premise, and fun-filled characters!",

I just found time traveling confusing. But watching it again I understand what it is, when you travel back in time in the old years and of course, recent years. Robert Zemeckis is back to direct the second movie, Back to the Future Part II along with Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd returning to their roles. Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel from 1985 to 2015 to prevent Marty's son from sabotaging the McFly family's future; when their arch-nemesis Biff Tannen, played by Thomas F. Wilson again, steals Doc's DeLorean time machine and uses it to alter history for his benefit, the duo must return to 1955 to restore the timeline. OK, so after the first film got it's massive praises back in 1985 the movie itself takes place in the year 1985 and now in 1955 where Marty had accidentally traveled in the year 1955. This one does the same thing and this time something is seriously wrong. Okay, now let me get to something that what changed about the movie. You know Claudia Wells, right? Where she played Jennifer Parker from the first film, she was replaced by Elisabeth Shue because she retired from acting due to her mother had been diagnosed with cancer, so now they reshot that scene in the opening where the first one ended. And of course, Crispin Glover didn't get to return which he want to due to he got paid less money. He sued the producers for using his likeness without his permission. Now there's something I didn't know about one thing that I completely missed out is the fact that I see Michael J. Fox in drag. It always baffles me that I didn't know who dresses up like a woman. I do know however that Tim Curry is always like that from The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I gotta say I really love the sequel much like the first one. I know it's not as good as the first but once you've seen it you grown to appreciate it. It had a funny story that correct the mistakes what Biff has done and it reenacts the same scenes from the first movie without bumping into the other selves. I also liked the funny part where Marty sneaks into Mr Strickland's office to get the almanac but finds the cover of it with the \"Ooh La La\" catalog. Now that I'm going to do the third and final film of the Back to the Future trilogy, Back to the Future Part III. Stay Tuned.",

On a 30 year-old movie that was only ever an adventure lark mostly for kids? \n\nI guess because I am intrigued by the disparity between parts I and II. I watched Part I again recently and enjoyed it so much that I became curious about how the story plays out in the sequels, but I found Part II so boring as to be almost unwatchable. \n\nThe first one works for me because of the devilishly clever butterfly-effect premise that the dysfunction in his family would be healed if his father had met his mother in a display of courage rather than as a victim. Also, there is something about going back to the 50s from the 80s that carries a wistful perfume of nostalgia, and the whole thing is just so much fun that my suspension of disbelief is enthusiastic.\n\nIn comparison, Part II feels like an excuse for adventurous complications -- clever without anything to care about at the core. Marty's chip on his shoulder -- that he won't let anyone call him a chicken -- feels tacked on; it doesn't evolve out of anything that happens in Part I. \n\nAnd watching this 1989 vision of 2015 from the vantage point of 2020 offers nothing of interest. in this 2015, the colors seem to have been inspired by a 1970s Denny's restaurant, and everything that used to roll along the ground now flies -- yawn. The dystopian vision of a rich bully in power should be interesting from our current vantage point, but it is too perfunctory to carry any sting. All is sidelined for the sake of the next preposterous action sequence.\n\nSo you've got the same writers, the same director, the same premise and largely the same cast. One movie, to my taste, is brilliant, and the other is two hours I regret I will never get back. How does that happen?",

Secondly unlike the other 2 this film doesn't involve the DeLorean breaking down and having to find a solution to get it up to 88 miles an hour. \n\nNext this film is very misunderstood. The whole story of the Almanac was merely a side story, the point of that was this is what happens when money ends up in the wrong hands. The real side to Part II for me is Marty and his problem with being called a chicken. It is only my theory but I think Doc took and Marty and Jennifer to the future so Marty could see for himself what a loser he has become but without actually telling him. It was at that point on that Saturday morning in 1985 when they were going to take the truck to the lake, have a romantic weekend and then just as it all seems too perfect now that Marty's family are wealthy but then the very next morning they come back from the lake, encounter Needles and Marty hits the Rolls Royce and his life is ruined. (Ironic that it happened right next their future home Hill Dale which would later be a run down area)\n\nIf you look at the start of Part II (which was remade due to a new actress playing Jennifer) when Marty asks Doc do they become arseholes, Doc hesitate's and then says no. So into 2015 Doc disguises Marty as his son so he will go into Cafe 80's with everyone assuming he is Marty Junior and telling him what a loser Marty Senior is. So when they return to 1985 (unaware the Almanac has changed everything) they return in the evening and that way Marty and Jennifer don't go to the lake now that it's too late and therefore avoid meeting needles the next morning.\n\nThis was hidden so well in Part I and then we see in Part II, 3 times he is called a chicken and 3 times he causes mayhem. The third time in which all he had to do was walk away from Biff with the Alamanc but let him get to him and his other self hit him with the door and lost the Almanac and although he got it back Doc ended up back in 1885 and Marty even admitted it was his fault at the start of Part III. Being hit by himself with the door was symbolic meaning if you try to prove yourself to idiots like Biff and Needles you are your own worst enemy. Hence Doc's catch phrase: \"The consequences could be disastrous.\" \nAnd in Part I: \"Anything you could do could have serious repercussions on future events!\"\n\nSo now Marty is now punished for his mistake by going back to a time and place where Cowards and \"Chickens\" are not welcome, 1885 in the Old West. But thankfully he bumped into his ancestors, Seamus and Maggie Mcfly and they tell him at the county fair about Seamus's brother Martin Mcfly who also ended up paying the price for trying to prove himself. This got Marty thinking, for example his father George who was a push over in 1955 and what Strickland said at the very start of Part I: \"No Mcfly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!\"\n\nLater Semus once again gives the hint to Marty on the morning he is supposed to meet Tannen saying he felt like his future depended on it.\n\nMarty then stops worrying about what people think of him and therefore avoids that accident with the Rolls Royce with Doc giving one final piece of advice: \"The future isn't written yet, the future is whatever you make it so make it a good one, both of you!\"\n\nNow this was a long theory but that is what I think the secret to Part II is.",

The second act is where it floundered for me. It shifted and moved in a dark way, and it did have some elements in it, but I think when they killed off George it made it a letdown for a little while. However, Doc Brown's timeline and how it plays out in it, I liked that a lot. With them going back in the past and reconfigure it, it was eye popping. Very clever.

It continues on from the first movie so it makes one long story instead of different stories, which made it a lot better. It is the worst one in the trilogy but is still as brilliant film in one of the best movie trilogies ever made. It depicted the alternate universe where Marty's dad was Biff Tannen really well because most of the time-travel films are not as good. It still has the same score and the memorable theme song that the first film introduced. After visiting 2015, Marty McFly must repeat his visit to 1955 to prevent disastrous changes to 1985...without interfering with his first trip. If you watch it very carefully you will see that Elijah Wood made his debut appearance in this film as ' video game boy'.\n\nIt has great visual effects and the use of green screen was brilliant. My only flaws with this movie is that it says that there will be flying cars in 2015, and there still isn't flying cars yet. I need those flying cars.  Overall it is a great film that follows up from it predecessor that i would recommend to people who have seen the first one. Recommend rating 12 for mild violence, moderate bad language, mild threat and partial nudity.\n\nGrade B+",

Michael J. Fox (Marty McFly) and Christopher Lloyd (Doc Brown) were great again. They play well off each other and have fun with the roles. It was cool to see how they handled the idea of what futuristic technology would be like in 2015. Things like the Hoverboard, flying cars, the Jaws 19 effect, and the way food is made are all part of the charm that makes this movie so cool. They also did a great job building on the idea from the first film that something being changed in the past could impact things. Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) going back to correctly bet on sporting events has a massive effect on everything and that plays out strongly.\n\nWeaknesses: The way the first film ended, you'd assume this one would be entirely in the future. While I liked how they put a twist on things and the way the course of events can be altered, it does feel like two separate movies with the future and past stuff. It's a bit jarring how quickly things change. The way things involving George, Marty's dad, are handled is weird. I know there were some behind the scenes issues that led to a lawsuit, but it's definitely weird to see the route they went. Also, going back to 1955, the same day as the first movie, makes it feel like something of a retread at times.\n\nOverall: It's not quite as good as the original, but there's still a bunch of fun to be had. The stakes feel higher, the futuristic stuff is way cool, and the charm of the first movie remains intact.",

You know what I mean. But, because the first film had such a devoted fanbase before society used such words, Robert Zemeckis, his buddy Steven Spielberg and some guy Zemeckis collaborated with on the trilogy called Bob Gale decided to continue the story. So now, I've decided to see how the story continues. And, man oh man, do I enjoy it. While it loses a bit of the charm that made the first film a classic, Back to the Future: Part II still remains entertaining enough to remain a great sequel to an even greater movie. From the slapstick humour to its chase sequences, something ALWAYS happens, guaranteed. For me, the movie focuses on one small task having to be done that unexpectedly goes wrong with a twist. Because, aside from the time-travel stuff, the heroes actually succeed in the task they had sought out to do early on but something goes wrong back in their time all because of one simple thing: a sports magazine. The performances here are great as always. Michael J. Fox shines as Marty McFly, Christopher Lloyd appears to, like the first film, have the time of his life playing Emmett \"Doc\" Brown, the scientist who looks the same regardless of what year he's in though when you come to think about it, Christopher Lloyd does look the same today as he did 30 years earlier, and Thomas F. Wilson does a great job of playing Biff and Griff Tannen and the alternate dystopian 1985 does sometimes feel frightening. The Tannens, the best movie assholes of all time. Just ask WatchMojo.com. BttF II remains fun throughout with Robert Zemeckis' assured direction despite the law of diminishing returns taking some of the original's charm.",

The second act, you had to grind your teeth because how Biff changed 1985. Everything was chaos!

What would my mum when she was my age think about the future (i.e. the present, where I am now the age that she was)? IT'S CONFUSING BUT JUST GO WITH IT.\n\nPagers really took off (misfire) and cars do too (misfire) and double ties are all the fashion (unfortunately, also a misfire) but man, doesn't the 'future' look cool? Sure, 2015 didn't really turn out to be like that but this film was always going to serve more as a time portal into the past than into the future and the pagers alone give us a good old sniff of the 1980s.\n\nThe real problem with the BTTF sequels is how highly-iterative they are of the original. In this (whilst it's well-done), much of the plot of the first film is simply re-done. There's just something a little lazy about that that I can't quite get past. \n\nFurther, there's a lot going on here- certainly too much, and it can make the film feel a little jumbled. Again, though- let me return to my moto of IT'S CONFUSING BUT JUST GO WITH IT.\n\nThe energy is bigger than ever and again there's the sense that this film was really going for it and, to me, it succeeded. if the story is solid and the passion is there, then I think you can overlook some of the bumps in the road (you know, if you even need roads where you are gong).",

If you like the original \"Back To The Future\" I suggest watching this film, it's still a good movie. And I give \"Back To The Future: Part II\" a 6.5/10.",

            "content": "So how accurate was 'Back to the Future: Part 2's vision of 2015? Predicting video calls in addition to holograms was spot on and you could maybe count half a point for hover-boards considering these handle-less segways have people believing they look as cool as they would be on actual hover-boards but hover-cars, auto-fitting clothes and Michael Jackson advertising tortillas proved too ambitious. Admittedly I am guilty of being overly ambitious through thinking this sequel would have been more different than its predecessor.\n\nThe original was enjoyable and inventive but the majority of the action was rather pedestrian, particularly when Marty travelled to the past where it tended to entail juvenile behaviour with Biff and his cronies. 'BTTF: Part 2' quickly addresses this by raising the stakes through using three timelines and showing the implications of time travel on the town instead of specifically Marty's family. Problems are subsequently created however because of the disintegrating logic associated with using numerous timelines while the movie also frustratingly refocuses back on Marty and Biff, completely forgetting the neighbourhood issues which were previously hinted as being a significant aspect. Furthermore, the choice to return to the same past events as the first film had me feeling like I had time travelled, but in an annoying way since I had no need to re-visit the past of two days ago. Marty basically retreads his old steps in order to prevent/change certain incidents. Bet they thought they were being smart. Unfortunately, despite incorporating a couple interesting scientific ideas, retreading the same steps fails to provide enough new material for audiences and ultimately came across as lazy writing.\n\nAfter all this ranting, I still have to congratulate it for maintaining the delightfully fun tone and while we are not yet gifted the ability to visit the future, this franchise's easy-to-watch nature is ideal for passing the time.",

Is \"Back to the Future Part II\" a worthy sequel?\nAfter the events of the last film, Marty and Doc are now headed to October 21 of 2015, but due to the recklessness of their acts, they accidentally allow Biff to change reality. So a journey to restore reality begins.\nLadies  and gentlemen, the day that seemed extremely distant has arrived: October 21 of 2015. The future is here and while it isn't as depicted in this film, here we are. It should be said that right off the bag, the fact that the only reason this sequel exist is due to monetary reasons, expectations are low and \"Back to the Future Part II\" proves the cliché that sequels are inferior to the original and are the first film done again.\"Back to the Future Part II\" counts with a messy story that's the complete opposite of the simple story of its predecessor, groan inducing scenes, a heavy use of recreations of scenes of the first film, one of the most ridiculous villains ever put to film (last time Biff was a goofy obstacle but know he is the evil that needs to be stopped), the acting suffers a major downfall (Llyod is extremely annoying, Crispin Glover is written out, and Thomas F Wilson is used so much to the point of wanting to stop watching the film), a surprisingly dark portion that doesn't fit in this cartoony trilogy, some characters are not needed, the script is filled with inconsistencies, an enormous lack of originality, and Zemeckis' direction is so desperate to recreate the charm of the original that it comes off as lazy. As you can see there are numerous problems within this film but there are two great elements: The settings (2015 and alternate 1985) are charming as the first is interesting due to its extreme inaccuracy and the latter for its over the top vibe that feels like if Tim Burton was the art director; the fun value is extremely weak but it is still there, and the ending is pure Back to the Future magic. \n\"Back to the Future Part II\" is one of the most desperate and messiest sequels ever made. It has some good scenes but most of the time it is a redo of the original without the simplicity that made it charming. If you adore the first film, you may enjoy this sequel but this is one of the most forced sequels you can find.",

Apart from that, the journey oscillating back and forth between the past and the future is a entertaining joy to watch as our two protagonists race against time righting the wrongs, only to create more impending problems that will threaten the course of their entire existence. With all the brain-popping theories regarding the alternate timeline and continuum, Zemeckis' sophomore effort shines and is set to stand the test of time.",

            "content": "Next up in my series of BTTF reviews is Back to the Future Part II, the film that wowed everyone with a glimpse at what the future could possibly look like, and although it is clearly nothing like it was envisioned in 1989 it is still very interesting to see the 'future that could have been' come to life on screen. \n\nBack to the Future Part II did what all sequels should do, it was larger in scale, it took bigger risks and it took the series to a whole new dimension by really focusing on the use of time travel. Now although it was bigger and the timelines got a whole lot more complex, topping the first film was nearly impossible but they tried their hardest and it payed off, making this film also an instant classic. Like its predecessor, this was also an endlessly entertaining film, still capturing the same humour that the first film did so well it manages to make you laugh consistently throughout. The characters of Doc and Marty again have great comedic timing and their chemistry is like no other film and it adds to the realism of these characters relationship. Whilst also maintaining that comedic aspect, the film also does spend quite a bit of time getting pretty serious and developing the plot for later in the film and for Part 3. \n\nThis film had the daunting task of having to top the first one, and how do you do that? Rather than going 30 years in the past they decided to go 30 years into the future. But why stop there? lets go 30 years into the future then 30 years into the past in another timeline and then 30 years into the past again just to mess with people. Although there was a lot of jumping between timelines in this film it managed to hold itself together very well without seeming like it was moving too fast. As expected, with all of these time jumps, the timeline of events is going to get a little more confusing, but the film i thought did a pretty great job at keeping audiences informed as to what was going on. There were a few exposition scenes that were a little too 'heavy' on information that could have been spread out a little. Having just watched it for like the 10th time, it all makes sense to me but for a first time watcher it may take another viewing to fully grasp the timeline changes. A very minor thing in a film that still does time travel better than 98% of time travel films out there. \n\nOne of the things that this film is remembered for is its visualisation of the future. Seeing all of these technological advancements in terms of cars, and clothes, and shoes, and hover-boards was incredibly mind-blowing for me when i watched it so you could imagine how it must have been for an audience that was even further away from that possible reality. It was a very interesting contrast with other more dirty dystopian futures you see in most sci-fi films, the cleaner, brighter look made it so much more memorable. Like i said, they are the scenes everyone remembers, the hover-board chase scene is an iconic action sequence that will never be forgotten, the sequence in Marty's future house was amazing seeing all of the small but significant advances in technology that people would only dream of. Many people often forget that the film also does represent the future in a very dystopian environment, and i thought in its own way, that was a very interesting juxtaposition to put in this film. Although it wasn't as fun and lively as seeing the cleaner future it was definitely interesting to see how greed and a money driven future would look like. Looking back on it now, i would say that the Dystopian representation of the future isn't any more far off than the Cleaner, more technologically advanced one, just saying. \n\nBut one of the most impressive sequences for me was when Marty and Doc travel back to 1955, the setting of the first film, and have to go around this time period whilst avoiding their other selfs from the first film. This is what really wowed me in terms of the incredible film-making and visual effects that were used in order to make it look like they had actually travelled into the setting of the first film without compromising what the first film set up. The shots were placed perfectly and the use of footage from the first film in combination of recreations of scenes from the first film from different angles was incredible, and for a film released in 1989 it was amazing to see. It also has what i think was the most exciting and fun ending sequence of the series that had me laughing, and in suspense the entire time. It closes off the story of this film perfectly and sets up the next film in a similar way to what the first film did. It may even be one of my favourite movie endings ever, i get goosebumps every time i watch it. And that is also due to the return of Alan Silvestri's incredible score and BTTF theme that gets me every time. \n\nAgain, the attention to detail was incredible, with fantastic call-backs to the first film and the little details that connect the alternate timelines timelines together, and also some foreshadowing for what is to come in Part 3, Robert Zemeckis' love for this world and these characters is on show. In the end, this film goes bigger, it goes to more places and it retains everything you love about the first film. It does lose some of that magic that you feel when watching the first film but it is still a masterpiece and a classic that even helped to elevate how good the first film was upon return viewings. - 9",

The story continues where the first movie ended. I do like the plot, as Marty and Doc travel to the Future, a changed present and back 1955, where you get to see scenes from the first movie from a totally different angle. The film was made back-to-back with the third and final chapter 'Back to the Future part 3'. Starring Michael J. Fox (Family Ties, Class of 1984), Christopher Lloyd (Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Piranha 3D), Thomas F. Wilson (April Fool's Day, Camp Nowhere), Lea Thompson (Jaws 3D, The Little Rascals), Crispin Glover (Beowulf, What's Eating Gilbert Grape) and Billy Zane (Titanic, the Phantom). Ready to go back?\n\nIn 1985, Doc Brown (Lloyd) persuades Marty McFly (Fox) and his girlfriend Jennifer Parker to join him on a trip to 2015, where they must help their future children. But while they are there, the old Biff Tannen (Wilson) uses the Delorean to travel back to 1955 to deliver a Sports Almanac, containing all the results of major sports events between 1950 and 2000. When our friends return to 1985, Marty is shocked to see that the world he knew has changed. His mother Lorainne (Thompson) has married the rich and successful Biff after Marty's father George (Glover) passed away, while Doc has been committed to an insane asylum. To undue these events, Marty and Doc will need to travel back to 1955, where they have to be careful not to interfere with Marty's previous trip...",

The first part of the film with all the memorable but ultimately wrong predictions of 2015. This is also the weakest part of the movie and only exists to deal with the appearance of Jennifer at the end of the previous entry (played by a very annoying Elizabeth Shue instead) and the mention of 'something has got to be done about your kids'. The plot kicks off when Biff steals the Delorean to go back to 1955 and in doing so creating an alternate 1985 where the 'Warriors' wouldn't be out of place. A clever and intelligent plot ensues. Back in 1989 I was one of the last of my peers to see it but did get to hear tales of confused minds. The twists of time travel get us to relive the original film from another angle and the final scene is very satisfying. Not as endearing as the original but still fun.",

I love that now in 2015 and 2016 that some props in this movie that were showed in the 2015 section are now finally being made except the flying car which will never be made because it's only science fiction and if electric cars are finally being made , what are the chances of a flying car being made. Another prop that's being made now is pepsi perfect but it didn't go nation wide, only sold 100 bottles but one prop that's during into an actual thing is power laces, when Nike confirmed that they were being made I automatically say, \"do they come in wide\". I love the Story and plot, fun time for the family and can't wait for the third movie. And final thing I love the nostalgia for people who grew up with this movie and now that it's 2015 / 2016 theirs a big celebration for this movie in October of 2015 and future Marty and doc Brown meet their past selves and its dey sha fu or whatever it means to see something that you have seen before.",

A time when I truly thought hover-boards were going to come into existence. A time when 2015 seemed so far away. And now, well...it's not. And there are no hover-boards. There are no flying cars. There are no self-drying jackets. \nBack to the Future II didn't get much about the future right, but it did have a lot of cool ideas. When the movie came out, it was my favorite BTTF film. Maybe it was the look into the \"future\", maybe it was the darker tone of the film, but I absolutely loved it. 25 years later...meh. \nAll the future stuff seems really forced. I don't think Bob Gale or Bob Zemeckis ever meant to make a sequel to the original, let alone 2 sequels. In fact, the Bobs are on record as saying that the whole thing with Doc Brown saying \"there has to be something done about your kids\" at the end of part 1 was all just a joke. But unfortunately they kind of painted themselves into a corner when Universal said they wanted a sequel. They HAD to start from where Part 1 left off. Hence all the crappy future scenes in part II.\nBut luckily, the movie gets better once all the future silliness is over with. The Biff \"revisionist\" 1985 is kind of cool in it's bleakness. It was pretty gutsy to kill off George McFly too (even if it had more to do with contract negotiations going sour). But the movie really gets going in its 3rd act.\nWe get to see something that's never been done before (or since). When Marty and Doc head back (again) to 1955, we get to see part 1 from a whole new perspective. The whole forward in time, then back in time, then back in time (again) can get a little confusing, but the way it's shot make it fun to watch. And if you've seen the 1st one a few times like I have, the revisiting of certain scenes will make you nostalgic for the original movie.\nAnd THAT'S where this film shines. The \"re-making\" of the original movie in the sequel is the best part about it. And then you realize that you just could of watched the 1st movie and be done with all the shenanigans.\nBut that's the old guy in me talking. The movie really is a great lead-up to the third and final chapter. Without #2, there couldn't have been a #3, and the third one manages to actually be a really great film in its own right. But that's another movie for another day. My overall opinion: not a bad movie, just not a great one either.",

            "content": "Back to the Future Part II is most definitely the weak link in the trilogy. Partly because it plays like a trailer for the first and third installments (literally ending with a trailer for part 3), and certainly because it tries to cover too much ground. To be honest, I've always found part 2 to be a bit of a mess. An entertaining mess, which certainly has its moments, but still. A mess.\n\nWhen you start playing around with time travel stories, it's pretty easy to paint yourself into a corner. The first film in the franchise kept things simple, so for the most part, everything made sense. Part 2 though strains credibility from the moment Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) shows up to take Marty (Michael J. Fox) to the future on a mission to prevent his son from getting arrested. Why couldn't the Doc take care of that himself? Why didn't the Doc just tell 1985 Marty about his son's future? The entire catalyst for the story is completely flawed, and once this train wreck of a plot gets going, there's no stopping it!\nthumb_bttf2-marlene\n\n\nIt's not all bad though, and it's interesting today in 2014 to see how the folks in 1989 envisioned the future. Some how I don't think we're getting hover boards and flying cars any time soon! But hilariously it looks like they predicted Google glass! The visual effects have aged very well, and it's clear that all involved were having a great time playing multiple versions of themselves from different time periods. Especially Mr Fox who shows up playing his own daughter!\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nYou absolutely have to see the first film in this trilogy before taking on part 2. It's difficult to follow as it is, so don't make things harder for yourself by starting with the first sequel. One fun thing to try with part 2 is to score how accurately the production design predicted the future. I'd give them a C.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThe transfer to Blu-ray is pretty decent, and I recommend you watch this in HD. The makeup effects have improved slightly over the original, but there's still some flaws.\n\nBest element for me: >\n\nI did enjoy the last act. It's essentially the finale of the first film, but shot from different angles as the second version of Marty sneaks around. Pretty clever stuff really.\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\n-> http://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

This film is great, but not that funny or inventive as the first film. The first film had a right mix up of all the ingredients, but when it comes to the sequel, the fun is slightly on a low. The second half is super like the first film, but this film looses some grip trying to make sense to the events that occurred on the ending of the first film. They just made up a cheap story in order to get a continuation, but anyway they make use of it in the second half. The film gets to have extreme pace once they get back to 1955 again. But in the first half, the things about the children and future seems to be peripheral. I believe that they should have brought a new story out instead of carrying on. But since they just did that we had a series that actually had continuation, like the LOTR Trilogy. This film is heavy on tension and sci-fi and at times is over-dramatic, but that's not a fault.",

The climax is fun in large part because you basically get to relive the climax of the first film but from different points of view. This whole trilogy features a fair amount of campiness, with the cartoonish villain of Biff Tannen appearing in various forms throughout. The level of overacting, and campiness reaches nearly unbearable heights during the 2015 \"Future\" sequence- particularly Michael J Fox playing his 1985 Marty McFly, his son, crossdressing as his daughter, and his future self (The latter two feature some tremendously poor makeup). The most unbearably overacted performance comes from Thomas Wilson Jr as \"Griff\" Tannen- the grandson of Biff in 2015. Almost the entire cast is at one point covered in poorly done makeup to attempt to make them look older, younger, or to play totally different characters. It starts to feel a bit gimmicky when the same 4 actors play something like 14 different characters (or different iterations of the same characters). This film is very messy, both in its story and technical creation. If you love these characters and this world established by the original you'll probably be entertained. Just don't expect a classic, top tier, adventure/comedy, both sequels are far inferior to the original.",

            "content": "This bizarre ride of pleasure is broken into three separate parts, I think, and while not every aspect of its broader direction works, it still amounts to a highly entertaining and strangely moving film.  It suffers the same inferiority that all respective sequels have when stemming from a classic, but in comparison to most other sequels, this is one hell of a follow-up.  We see Marty and Doc launched this time into the future, for what turns out to be a very silly, very manic, but undeniably hilarious forty minutes.  Things take a turn for the worse when Biff acquires the means to get rich, and thus creates his own parallel reality which thankfully doesn't last long, because this is where the film loses its bearings a little for me.  This darker turn just feels more like a stain on the fun-filled fantasy element achieved by Zemeckis and the chemistry between Fox and Lloyd up to this point.  However, it does set into motion a fascinating dilemma, which then pulls the story right back into 1955, where the movie finally finds its foothold, and cleverly intertwines with the events of the original film.  Overall, 'Part II' lacks the charm and the subtly most would have expected, but it still dishes out some deliciously fast-paced entertainment, and every time I watch it, I tend to like it more and more.",

            "content": "Back to the Future Part 2 is quite the mixed bag for me. With the first movie instantly becoming one of my favorite movies, I had some high(ish) expectations for this. Sadly, for most of the run time, Part 2 is unsatisfying, lazy, and rather flat. The first half of the movie did very little for me. Halfway through, Marty goes back to 1955. Thankfully, this second half of the movie completely saved this from being a truly awful sequel.\r\n\r\nPart 2 picks up right where Part 1 left off. Doc Brown returns to 1985 immediately after the events of the first movie. He takes Marty and Jennifer into the Delorean and shots to the future, 2015 to be exact. Marty must return to prevent his future son from getting into trouble that will negatively affect his future family. But while in the future, old Biff Tannen steals the time machine and brings a sports almanac from 2015 back to 1955. He gives it to his past self, and alters the space time continuum. Faced with a horribly altered future, Marty must return to 1955 and prevent Biff from using the almanac to bet on sporting events.\r\n\r\nThe scenes in 2015 and the altered 1985 really didn't click with me. They were just too weird and unfunny. The movie seemed like it was rambling around, looking for a way to set up a decent story. Once we get past all that, we are given material worth of a sequel to a truly fantastic movie. Sadly, more than half the run-time is spent on the uninspired set up.\r\n\r\nMichael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd return as the protagonists Marty McFly and Doc Brown. They are both as good as they were in the first movie, but they sadly aren't given very much good material. Fox is given a chance to play an older Marty, which is kinda fun. Doc Brown's role is resigned to story exposition, though Lloyd is still brilliant.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast is nearly as memorable or funny as the supporting cast from Part 1. Thomas F. Wilson once again makes a great villain. Lea Thompson is underused as Lorraine, and only has one scene. Elisabeth Shue takes over the role of Jennifer and does a decent job. She isn't given enough material to really show if she is really good in the part; but she does make the character's transition from Claudia Wells seamless. What is noticeably lacking from the sequel's supporting cast is Crispin Glover as George McFly. Sure there were plenty of reasons why Glover's return to the franchise didn't happen, but he is still greatly missed.\r\n\r\nThe production of the 2015 scenes is interesting to see. Flying cars and the crazy clothes are certainly not how it's like today. Yet the filmmakers still did get some things right...amazingly. Robert Zemeckis technically does a respectable job with this, but not nearly as good a job as he did on the first. The finale hoverboard chase is really impressive and fun. But mostly, the whole production just feels like a step back. Even Alan Silvestri's sophomore Back to the Future score fails to leave an impression.\r\n\r\nWhile problems do abound with this sequel, there definitely is some upside. If you can get through the slog that is the first half of the movie, you will be rewarded with a very clever and fun second half. Following a classic is never easy, and Back to the Future Part 2 proves that. The second half is so good, that I almost gave this a positive rating. But all things being considered, it deserves exactly the rating I'm giving it.\r\n\r\n\"The time-traveling is just too dangerous. Better that I devote myself to study the other great mystery of the universe: women.\" 5.5/10",

            "content": "\"Dr. Emmett 'Doc' Brown\" (Christopher Lloyd) arrives from the future seconds after coming back from the past to find \"Marty McFly\" (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend \"Jennifer Parker\" (Elisabeth Shue, who has taken over the role from Claudia Wells starting in this movie). \"Brown\" informs them that there is a problem with their children in the future, and insists that they come with him.\r\n\r\nIn the future, after \"Doc\" renders \"Jennifer\" unconscience when she begins to ask way too many questions in the excitement of being in the future, \"Doc\" and \"Marty\" find \"Marty Jr.\" (Fox), who is a complete nerd, being harassed by \"Griff Tannen\" (Thomas F. Wilson), the future grandson of \"Biff Tannen\" (Wilson), who is the high school archrival of \"Marty's\" father, \"George\" (Jeffrey Weissman and, in footage from the original movie to show the original actor's face, Crispin Glover). After \"Marty\" helps his nerdy, but look-alike son, with \"Griff\" and his gang, he comes across an antiques store and purchases a magazine that lists sports results from 1950 to 2000.\r\n\r\nEventually, the future version of \"Biff\" gets his hand on the magazine and steals the magazine, and steals the DeLorean time machine to go back to visit his younger self in 1955.\r\n\r\nNow, \"Doc\" and \"Marty\" have to go back to 1955 again, get the magazine and avoid their other selves that are already there (from the first movie).\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most original sequels ever made, as it perfectly inserts many scenes from the original -- many of which were reshot at different angles. It is also one of the few where multiple actors are playing more than one character, even if the character is the same person. You get to see many versions of the same person in other words.\r\n\r\nThe performances are pretty fun, especially when the movie is in the scenes set in the future. Not only are we introduced to new characters, we see the same actors playing these comical characters -- especially Fox, who plays two characters in the future -- \"Marty Jr.\" and his sister, \"Marlene\" (who gets very little screen time compared to \"Marty Jr.). It must have been difficult for the cast to create variations of the character they originated in the first movie.\r\n\r\nThe special effects in this film are not very original, but still hold up for the most part. While watching, I only saw a few instances where the special effects have weaken over the years, and it was obvious that they were inserted during post-production.\r\n\r\nI was pretty disappointed in the future \"Hill Valley\" for the most part. None of the vehicles looked authentic to me, and the clothing was fairly laughable with the choice of colors and design. There was some originality in the future -- the \"Jaws 19\" marquee, the self-tying sneakers (with light-up Nike logos) and the famed \"Mattel Hoverboard.\"\r\n\r\nThe comedy is only worth some chuckles through out the entire movie. Some jokes are just rehash from the previous film, and are not set up well to the point that you don't expect it. However, at least one scene in the future is a nice rework of one of the more memorable scenes of the first movie.\r\n\r\nMake-up effects are not up to par in this movie. You get simple make-up effects to only fairly elaborate make-up effects. The \"aged\" effects are not good in my opinion. It is obvious that the future version of \"Biff\". as well as the future version of \"Jennifer's\" cleavage, are prostetics (especially the cleavage, which looks more like rubber more than it does skin). Some performers even looked as if they had obvious hair dye jobs, instead of wigs.\r\n\r\nA lot of the music came from the original movie, with some new songs add in. I think only one song was used really well to set the tone of the scene, the rest were just there if you ask me.\r\n\r\nOne thing that worked well, although it was a bit odd, was the scenes from the original movie reshot from the point of view of \"Marty\" and \"Doc.\" If you notice, \"Marty's\" father, \"George\" is seen not looking at the camera, or his face is blurry due to being in the background of the scene where the pricipal characters are being shot. You are seeing a different actor in the role since Crispin Glover did not sign on to be in this movie, but you hear his voice from clips taken from the first movie.\r\n\r\nThis film can get a bit confusing at times, due to the time paradox that \"Doc\" explains to \"Marty.\" Sometimes, you forget which version of the characters you are watching -- especially when another version is in the scene.\r\n\r\nThis is a good movie for the entire family. The language, and violence is pretty mild, and the comedy is never crude or adult-oriented. The only thing I would suggest is that you watch the movies back-to-back.",

They don't surpass it, but when it comes to sequels they're some of the best. The continue the great story, and deserve to be acknowledged. \n\nPart II has Marty (Michael J. Fox) travelling forward to 2015. Here he encounters his son, but that's only a small part of the story. Marty gets a sports almanac which is stolen by an older Biff, and given to Biff in 1955. Thus, Marty needs to get it back. He travels to an alternate 1985, where Biff is basically king after betting everything he had in sports. Marty's mom (Lea Thompson)  is his \"servant\" and George McFly (Previously played by Crispin Glover) is dead.\n\nMarty goes back to 55' in order to get the book back so that the future can be restored. The strong point, again, are the characters. The best thing about II is that we see them as older people, younger people, and their families. The writing is just as clever as in part I, and is complex but not confusing.\n\nThe acting also again is great. J. Fox seems to get more comfortable with this character with each film. Lloyd is also great as Doc. However, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) steals the show. In this one, Biff is the main villain, and we see lots of him! We see him old, young, nice, mean, and all kinds of other ways.\n\nI also love the future technology. There's a Jaws 10, lace up shoes, and hover boards. There's also this pizza maker thing, that was a bit weird. Oh, and before I forget, there's Flea as Needles.\n\nI wouldn't compare this to the first film, because the first is perfect, but it is still a fantastic film. There's some dopey makeup, but it doesn't fully deteriorate from the film. If you haven't seen it I would see it, but I still prefer the first. See it if you haven't!",

Let's recap: After his previous adventure, Marty is whisked away by Doc into the future (2015 to be precise) to alter an event that could harm his family. However, he comes into contact with an almanac & believing that he'll grow into a loser like his father, he buys it but Doc throws out but his arch rival Biff Tannen comes into contact with it, steals the time machine & gives the book to himself in 1955, which is where they overlap. BTTF Episode 2 was a huge hit at the time but was criticized for being slightly darker than the first episode & thematically it is. Regardless, take it for what it's worth. I liked it (along with the first episode). Stay tuned for BTTF Episode 3!",

We pick up where we left off, with Marty and Doc flying off to the future in an attempt to save the McFly family name. \n\n        Viewers are thrown straight into the action, with punches being thrown, a chase (purposefully very similar to one its predecessor) and some truly awful acting on Thomas F. Wilsonâ(TM)s part that borders suicidal.  In fact it isnâ(TM)t just the Wilsonâ(TM)s performance that is borderline suicidal, but the first half of the film, is so unbelievably tacky and awful that it seems like a completely different film from its marvellous predecessor.\n\n        However at some point during the middle of the film, cannot quite remember when, the film transforms into something remarkably similar to the first film.  Because whilst itâ(TM)s enjoyable to watch, the second half is a sort of photocopy of the first film (similar to a photocopier because there are minor differences, like colour and bits are cut off the edges etc.).  In fact they are so similar that the climax mostly takes place where the end of the first one took place, at the school dance.  I think a good example of the similarity, is the way that one scene from the first one is taken and recycled into the second one, using a hoverboard instead of a skateboard is the only difference.\n\n        This film is split into two parts, a truly awful work of cinema and then a copied piece of cinema.  It seems Zemeckis and Gale have been so hinged on the success of the first one, they didnâ(TM)t want to exit their comfort zone.",
