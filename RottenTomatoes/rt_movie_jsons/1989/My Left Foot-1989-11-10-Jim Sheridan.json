    "summary": "No one expects much from Christy Brown (Daniel Day-Lewis), a boy with cerebral palsy born into a working-class Irish family. Though Christy is a spastic quadriplegic and essentially paralyzed, a miraculous event occurs when, at the age of 5, he demonstrates control of his left foot by using chalk to scrawl a word on the floor. With the help of his steely mother (Brenda Fricker) -- and no shortage of grit and determination -- Christy overcomes his infirmity to become a painter, poet and author.",

            "content": "Incredibly touching story that should inspire you to take action in your life.\n\nIrish director Jim Sheridan's biopic about Irish writer and painter Christy Brown entitled My Left Foot: The Story of Christy Brown (1989) is quite amazing, honestly. Sheridan's direction lets the viewer see the world from Christy Brown's unimaginable perspective as he can only control his left foot due to Cerebral Palsy leaving the rest of his body limp. Sheridan makes you feel what it must have been like growing up in a poor household in Dublin with 12 siblings and an alcoholic father. Sheridan's direction is artful and really captures Christy's maturity and wisdom. You get to see how he could write and paint using only his left foot. Can you imagine living like that?\n\nMy Left Foot is life affirming in that Christy Brown was given an unbearable burden in life and still made a name for himself as a profound writer and notable painter in his own time. Writers Shane Connaughton and Jim Sheridan make no amends for Christy's rage and angry frustrations over his poor life and shocking condition. Every word of his depression, suicidal thoughts, and desire for love are moving and resonant.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis is a force of nature with his method acting as Christy Brown. You feel his harrowing frustrations, genuine warmth, sudden humor, intolerable self loathing, deep depressions, hopeless attitude, menacing rage, and fearsome indignant anger that lashes out at those around him. Day-Lewis portrayed Christy as the complex man he was with sincerity and nuance instead of making Brown a saint. It's incredible watching Day-Lewis type, paint, and move around using only one foot. My Left Foot boasts one of acting's greatest performances and a sheer dedication to the art of method acting from all-time legend Daniel Day-Lewis.\n\nBrenda Fricker is sublime as Christy's patient and kind mother Bridget Fagan-Brown. You feel her concern for Christy and worry over her family's finances all while seeing her long suffering relationship. Fricker is incredibly subtle in My Left Foot and earned her Best Supporting Actress Oscar in my opinion. Alison Whelan is gorgeous and moving as Sheila Brown. You understand her worries for her mother and handicapped brother that feels so raw when she must leave. Declan Croghan is fun and serious as necessary as Tom Brown. Eanna MacLiam is very charming and funny as Benny Brown with his helpful assistance to Christy. Cyril Cusack is kind as the welcoming Lord Castlewelland.\n\nRuth McCabe is sweet and tough as Mary, who eventually marries Christy. Fiona Shaw is sweet and encouraging, then heartbreaking as Dr. Eileen Cole, who teaches Christy to speak clearer. Ray McAnally is funny and terrifying as Christy's hard-edged father Patrick Brown. Hugh O'Conor is outstanding as young Christy Brown pulling off struggling to move at all or express himself any way he can.\n\nEditor J. Patrick Duffner's cuts together a man's life in 103 brief minutes with a fast pace and sharp cuts from painting to dramatic scenes. Jack Conroy's artful cinematography always focuses on Christy's perspective and life from his lens. The intimate feeling of his wide shots in small rooms are practically close-up shots here. My Left Foot bears a close personal feeling because of these neat shot choices. Every close-up of Christy's feet is fascinating with subtle movements captured on camera.\n\nProduction designer Austen Spriggs crafted the tiniest Irish home you've ever seen to really demonstrate how claustrophobic living there must have felt. Mark Geraghty's art direction leans into expressive paintings and Christy's feet in striking shots. From artful beauty to the reality of Christy's broken body alongside his determined will to live. Shirley Lynch's set decoration really nailed that little bed with a dozen kids in it at once to display the Brown family's poverty.\n\nComposer Elmer Bernstein's classical style score is really heartfelt. His every note is gentle and caresses Christy even when he's alone. My Left Foot features one of cinema's great melodic scores with a serene softness and earnest empathy in musical form. Joan Bergin's costumes are neat and really fit the 1950's era in Ireland. Ken Jennings' transforms Daniel Day-Lewis and gives everyone no gloss or frills with natural make-up.\n\nIn all, My Left Foot must be seen with a triumphant and enthralling performance from Daniel Day-Lewis. I was as touched by Brenda Fricker as Day-Lewis, honestly. This is a humanist film about perseverance among tremendous suffering and pain.",

            "content": "Little more than your average ‘inspirational' biopic about a man with a disability this is only slightly better than The Theory of Everything (2014) and I Am Sam (2001). It's hard not to feel emotionally manipulated while watching events play out in a fashion that is meant to jerk tears out of you. Unfortunately director Jim Sheridan directs all of this gracelessly so that we are not successfully manipulated and instead recognize the clumsy attempts, only angering us further. In 1989 classics like When Harry Met Sally… (1989), Do the Right Thing (1989) and Sex, Lies and Videotape (1989) were released and yet this clichéd, trite little movie earned a Best Picture nomination.\n\nChristy Brown, Daniel Day-Lewis, is born with cerebral palsy into a poor family of 15. His supportive mother Bridget, Brenda Fricker, struggles to raise him as his alcoholic, abusive father Patrick, Ray McAnally, spends his earnings on liquor and she miscarries a child. As he grows into adolescence he discovers that he can use his left foot to communicate and displays unusual intelligence. This pushes him to paint and he quickly discovers that he can produce work of a high quality. His life is changed by Dr. Eileen Cole, Fiona Shaw, who trains him to speak and encourages his painting ability but their relationship ends when he falls in love with her and discovers she is engaged to another man precipitating a breakdown at a restaurant. He recovers and writes a memoir recounting his experiences that brings him money and international fame but his family continue to suffer hardships.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis delivered an acclaimed turn in this film as the main character with his commitment to the tics and mannerisms of a real person but thirty years later his performance seems less impressive than it would have been at the time. You can't help seeing the ‘acting' in the performance as he was so over the top that I was never convinced I was watching a character going about his day but instead felt that I was seeing an actor trying very hard to put in a good performance. The other performers in the film fare much better as Fricker gives a pleasant, naturalistic performance as the saintly mother figure who so often appears in this sort of film. She does a good job at playing sympathetic and loving with a hidden steeliness but she hardly succeeds Anjelica Huston in Enemies, A Love Story (1989) and Dianne Wiest in Parenthood (1989).\n\nThe plot developments in the film are also terribly predictable as the film never deviates from the traditional biopic formula and the eureka moments and tragedies don't hit quite as hard as they would have did they not feel so milquetoast. The screenplay by Shane Connaughton and Jim Sheridan rolls through setting up the various problems that our saintly matriarch faces without a second thought as we never get any specificity on these issues and are meant to generally understand the horrors of her life. While I can imagine that it would be terribly difficult to raise a child with cerebral palsy this film did not illustrate that idea in a way that felt new or interesting. Adding to the tedium was the storytelling device of having Brown and his future wife, a kindly nurse, interact in the present while cutting back to his childhood in extended flashbacks. If I wanted a traditional biopic I could watch Coal Miner's Daughter (1980) or Silkwood (1983) both of which boast incredible lead performances that have not aged a day.\n\nFor those who love films in the vein of The Imitation Game (2014) this will satiate their hunger for a dull, paint by numbers story with a dubious connection to real events but I didn't think this film did nearly enough with what could have been an interesting story. 1989 was such a deep year of film and it's disappointing that so many rotten films, Field of Dreams (1989), Driving Miss Daisy (1989), Dead Poets Society (1989) and this one, made it into major categories. Day-Lewis would go on to do bigger and better things as would most of the cast and I am glad that he was able to leave behind this regrettable performance.",

I went to school with a number of kids confined to wheelchairs (some because of cerebral palsy just like Christy Brown.) My heart has always been with people who have physical disabilities, so I instantly was on Christys side and hoping that things would work out for him. Daniel Day-Lewis is clearly giving his all in this performance and it shows. He never feels like he is mocking or putting on an act, it comes across as genuine. And Hugh OConor also did great playing Christy as a young boy.\n\nHowever, there was something missing in My Left Foot. The way the story was structured it shows a lot of moments in Christys life, but often they are odd moments or things that seem strange to be highlighted. While there is one moment where we see Christy first learning to write with his toes, we never get to see other breakthrough moments like when he starts to paint or talk. Its as if they skipped a large and rather important chunk of his life. The movie was more interested in talking about Christys view of his father, and then Christys first romantic crush.\n\nThere were some spectacular scenes that are deeply affecting, but they were few and far between. I think it also would have been nice to get a clearer understanding of the size of this family. Considering he had 22 siblings and 9 of them died while infants, it seems they could have easily used that to reinforce the financial struggles of his parents. There was so much that seemed ripe for discussion and yet it was all passed over. Im not saying that My Left Foot is bad, it simply feels like an incomplete picture. And, sadly, some of the parts of the picture I was most interested in seeing are the ones that were missing.",

His family is mostly a good gang, especially Christy's mother, his sister and brothers. His father is not too bad, but he is not the best rolemodel or believer of his own son's abilities. He also enjoys the pub quite a lot.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis is delivering another splendid performance - it's very believeable. The kid that plays him Christy for the first half hour must get his props too. Superb work!\n\nJim Sheridan is not a name I have paid much attention too, but I've seen a few of his films. This is a very solid movie, with a great plot and solid execution.\nI get the praise for DDL's performance, but I must mention the Polish film \"Chce sie zyc\" from 2013, where actor Dawid Ogrodnik portrayed a man with cerebral palsy even better.\n\n7.5 out of 10 pieces of chalk.",

It is years before the Brown's afford a proper wheelchair for the physically struggling Christy.\nChristy as an adult is played by the exceptional Daniel Day-Lewis.

The film was about a boy (later a man) who was diagnosed as a mental retard for his early life, while really only having Cerebral Palsy. As a man he becomes an extraordinary painter and writer, this is based on a true story by the way. It was an extremely dramatic film that can make any man depressed, but light hearted enough to give you a few chuckles. Some scenes dwindled my mood, and then the next up lifts me to an inspirational moment. The performances were incredibly talented, Daniel Day Lewis was a solid lead, but Brenda Ficker stole the show. They both well deserved there Oscars, and from the other picture nominees I saw from the year (Dead Poets Society and Driving Miss Daisy) this would be my winner. The only problem I felt was that the protagonist Christy always felt to deep or to pitiful, I wish there were more times that we could see him as a regular man. A tremendous film none the less.\n\n3.5 stars+",

            "content": "Famous for being a film which showcased Daniel Day-Lewis' first case of unbridled character dedication through inability to ever break character on set, My Left Foot is a compelling and inspiring biographical piece about the incredible work one can do when triumphing over weakness.\n\nBefore Daniel-Day Lewis' performances rises to becoming the thing that stocks put, it's Hugh O'Conor's role as the young Christy Brown which shows because his physicality is absolutely excellent and he strongly conveys what is occurring in Christy Brown's mind as he shakes around with a troubled expression and many thoughts he had to deal with. Hugh O'Conor is faced with the massive challenge of having to set up a character to be portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis, the man considered to be the finest actor of our generation in his first Academy Award winning performance. Yet he does it excellently, never speaking but capturing the strong cerebral palsy which captures a character who really wants to as Christy Brown did, and Hugh O'Conor does it excellently in his brief time on screen. He should be very proud.\nBut as expected, he is overshadowed  by the exceptional work of Daniel Day-Lewis. Daniel Day-Lewis perfectly gives honour to Christy Brown in his compelling portrayal of the Cerebral Palsy ridden Irishman who merely uses it as the inspiration to become the best artist he can be by triumphing over it. The instant Daniel Day-Lewis graces the screen, he gives off the usual effect to the audience where they feel as if this man is one they have never ever seen before. His character is one who is so human underneath his continuous shaking and poorly articulated words that he does the normal things one would do, including playing soccer using only his left foot. The emphasis the story and Daniel Day-Lewis put on the importance of his left foot is what makes My Left Foot the important story that it is, because Christy Brown achieved more with his left foot than half the artists today could dream of doing with their entire active bodies, but he had to face adversity to do so. But armed with only his left foot, Christy Brown makes a huge triumph in an inspiring story and Daniel Day-Lewis makes the huge triumph of immaculately conveying that. His performance makes this biopic one of the single greatest Irish films of all time.\nBrenda Fricker also shared a compelling chemistry with him and gave a sweet performance of her own to portray the mother behind Christy Brown. She has passion for her character's son in her performance, a passion that could only come from a real mother. She captures it incredibly finely and goes on to make the achievement of being the first Irish woman to win an Academy Award, one that was truly well deserved. She really made us feel that there was always someone there for Christy Brown, and it makes the story all the more sweeter.\nMy Left Foot is an incredible piece of Irish cinema with a heart tugging true story about an incredible artist, and the simple fact is that it's told in an incredible manner, thanks to the Academy Award worthy direction of Jim Sheridan who pours the luck of an Irishman into telling a story about one, one which comes from the roots of his land and his heart, one which is a magnificent tale which he handles with so much care. Jim Sheridan truly matches Daniel-Day Lewis' skill and makes them an impeccable team on My Left Foot, and I was very thoroughly pleased with it even though I went to extraneous lengths to get my hands on a copy. I'm glad I did, because never giving up on finding the tale of Christy Brown makes the tale about a man and the power of his left foot worth the wait and the search.",

            "content": "The best way to describe a film like Jim Sheridan's 1989 drama My Left Foot is that it is a film that satisfies and dissatisfies both at the same time. On one hand, it does what it's supposed to do which is look into the life of the story's main character. On the other hand, I felt that something about this story was missing and I ended up really wanting much more than what I got. \n\nLet's focus on what's good about this film first and foremost: Daniel Day-Lewis himself. No one else but Daniel Day-Lewis could have successfully pulled off the role of a disabled Irishman who can only move with his left foot and yet become an inspiring artist. The way that he disappears into his character and convinces us that he has these physical and mental struggles is nothing short of expertly done. \n\nDaniel Day-Lewis isn't the only cast member of this picture that delivers impressive acting, Brenda Fricker is also exceptional as his mother who tries her best to figure out how to take care of her son. Fiona Shaw is also pretty decent as a doctor who forms a special bond with the main character. These three performances are basically the best aspect of this film. \n\nDespite that praise, I feel that the storytelling and screenplay for this film is very much a double edged sword. Like I stated earlier, while the storytelling is very efficient and keeps moving along, I could make the argument that it moves a little too fast. What I mean by that statement is that I felt there were parts of the story that felt incomplete in my mind. \n\nFor example, the main character has a relationship with this one woman in the chronological end of this story given that the story's told through flashbacks. We only see this certain character for about 10 minutes at most and we are given no reason why she's necessary to the plot. In addition to this, while I felt that we got to knew the Day-Lewis character okay enough, I knew little to nothing about everyone else to the point where I forgot about them. \n\nI really had no idea what I thought about this picture immediately after watching it and I still have no idea if I still like or dislike the film even while writing the very review you are reading. While I can't say there's anything really terrible about it and recognize the acting skill behind it, I could also say that there aspects of this film that are completely forgettable. It really is a close call, but in the end, I'm afraid that due to its lack of making an impact on me, I can't recommend My Left Foot.",

            "content": "My Left Foot is a stunning real life drama about author and artist Christy Brown. This is superb picture that is brilliantly acted by method actor Daniel Day-Lewis, who would subsequently win an Academy Award for his performance as the adult Brown. For his role, Lewis would study Cerebral Palsy patients for two months and go as far as being fed by someone else. The result is impressive. I've been living with Cerebral Palsy all my life, and though it's not as extreme as Christy Brown case, I found Daniel Day-Lewis' performance to be accurate, well done and superb.  I have a minor case of CP, kind of like RJ Mitte from Breaking Bad, but I've lived long enough with CP to notice that all the movements, and muscle spasms that Daniel Day-Lewis made, were dead on. You would swear that he had CP. This is a compelling true story about someone who overcomes great odds to achieve something great in the face of adversity. This is a well crafted movie that is a stunning piece of cinema and is worth seeing if you love stories of  triumph, then this is a must see for you. Daniel Day-Lewis is a stunning actor, and his method is legendary and he definitely deserved that Oscar. My Left Foot is an excellent, flawless film that for me, anyways stood out because I related to Christy Brown on a more personal level. For the average viewer, I strongly recommend this one as well, and each viewer can take something special from this movie. This is a very inspirational movie that delivers solid Drama, with a few humorous bits to make for a memorable viewing experience that you soon won't forget. If you come across My Left Foot, definitely check it out, you won't regret it.",

The biggest strength of this movie is its 3 key performances. First would be Daniel Day-Lewis. Immersed perfectly into his role, he didn't just play Christy Brown but became Christy Brown. Arguably his best performance. Next would be Brenda Fricker playing Christy's strong mother, binding the whole movie together. And third would be Hugh O'Conor  who played young Christy Brown. Doing as good as Day-Lewis, he set it all up wonderfully for Day-Lewis to take over. A movie about \"triumph over the odds\", My Left Foot neither makes you feel sorry for the character, nor intends to do that. A profoundly rich experience. Highly recommended.",

Lewis is not just one of the best actors i've ever seen but one of the most committed, smartest and riskiest actors ever. He doesn't just PLAY Christy Brown, he lives and goes minute-to-minute physically with the character just powerful & applauding stuff from Lewis. Brenda Fricker breakthrough with her excellent Oscar-winning performance as the mother. Ruth McCabe as Christy's caretaker and love interest Mary, she's a joy especially with her scenes with Lewis. The-late Ray McAnally is worth-mentioning as the father. So is Hugh O'Conor who plays the young Christy Brown. Fiona Shaw is really enjoyable to watch here as well.\"\n\n\"This movie is inspiring to look at, has a great message and it's emotional. It's a must-see when it comes to see something important and inspiring.\"",
