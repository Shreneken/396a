    "summary": "A new English teacher, John Keating (Robin Williams), is introduced to an all-boys preparatory school that is known for its ancient traditions and high standards. He uses unorthodox methods to reach out to his students, who face enormous pressures from their parents and the school. With Keating's help, students Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) and others learn to break out of their shells, pursue their dreams and seize the day.",

            "content": "Thought-provoking but oversimplified \n\n\"Dead Poets Society\" is definitely worth watching, but it loses a star due to two main points:\n\n1 - Mr. Keating's encouragement for students to follow their dreams doesn't prepare them for the real-life consequences of choosing a less conservative path.\n\n2 - The movie's portrayal of conservative authorities as heartless and irrational is an unfair oversimplification, as their emotions and reasons for advising against taking risks can be more complex.\n\nThe film's unrealistic nature stems from Mr. Keating being too left and other conservatives being too right. A more balanced approach would involve someone in the middle, tailoring their advice to each individual's personality and situation, such as strengthening Neil emotionally before encouraging him to pursue his dreams. A one-size-fits-all solution feels oversimplified.\n\nNevertheless, \"Dead Poets Society\" is a thought-provoking, well-directed, and well-produced movie that deserves 4 stars.",

No one has any idea about loving life. How are you supposed to love life, what does it mean to love life? You are only taught to live life. To conduct life in a manner that would one day yield something. Money, power, fame, respect. \n\nBut once in a lifetime someone comes into your life and shows you what it means to love life. They make you see the beauty in mundane, and the extraordinary in the simple things. They make your heart pound faster and then make it calm down by a quiet whisper. Their words float on the air like fragrance from a flower. They linger around you long after they were spoken. You feel the earth move beneath your feet and your heart thumping loud. Like it is banging a door that opens to the future. And you see a futur with millions of possibilities. You can be whatever you want to be... Even nothing. And you see beauty in that too. \n\nOh gosh! How beautiful it is to find someone who makes you fall in love with life itself. Who helps you to see life as a poetry, read it verse by verse, in its rhythm and meter, and then one day become poetry yourself...\n\nMr. John Keating, it would have been my deepest pleasure if I ever had a teacher like you. I most certainly would have fallen in love with my life and with you. \n\nO Captain! My Captain!",

The scene that really got to me was after Neil committed suicide and it showed Robin Williams crying at a desk, which hits a lot harder now for obvious reasons. I don't recognize much of the young actors in productions that come out today but all of them did very well and were memorable. What is life without free thinking? What is life without an identity and passion??",

This might be his best role ever - he balances his humor with infectious inspiration and realism. The film occasionally wavers with convincingly realistic dialogue and performances, but this is never the case for Williams, who brings every scene he's in right back down to Earth.\n\nIt's got some problematic moments, mostly surrounding the \"relationship\" between Knox and Chris, which varies from mildly creepy to outright predatory, and because of which Knox never suffers any consequences, of course. It would have been nice for a film with so much foresight and nuanced perspective to handle this topic a little more gracefully.\n\nThe rest of the subplots are generally really satisfying and the film does a good job of making relatively-low-stakes situations feel like life-or-death (up until the actual life-or-death situations show up, of course). The school administrators are written with a cold callousness that boils your blood and gets you emotionally-sided with our group of kids. And it was really refreshing to see all these kids actually look like kids, acne and all.\n\nThis is an extraordinary, flawed, beautiful film which I believe will only get better with age.",

I would get angry with the characters, I would laugh with the characters, I even cried for a couple of them. This movie moved me much more than I expected. It even changed my perspective on life. Very few movies can do that. Although I was deeply moved by this movie, I still felt that they focused too much on some of the weaker aspects the the stronger aspects. For instance, Robin Williams did an incredible performance, but his character didn't have much depth. He had a whole lot of personality, but the only time we learn about his past through direct and indirect charecterization is when we learn about his time as a student when he created the Dead Poets Society. He had all these great times to shine whenever he was talking to his boss, but the every time that happened, it just got brushed over and the the boss i turns out to be even worse of a person.

It might've been my distaste for \"old\" movies (I had no real concept of time in the seventh grade) or it may have been my preference for Disney Channel Original movies, but I was not enthralled by the idea of a group of teenage boys reading each other poetry outside past bedtime.\n    However. I am no longer in the seventh grade. Lots has changed since then. I have grown up quite a bit, admitted my love for The Breakfast Club, and written a final essay about Hitchcock films. I would not say I am better than I was, but I think I have improved my taste since then. The Dead Poet's Society is not merely interesting because it follows a group of teenage boys in the 1950s; the movie has a deeper meaning, I believe.

            "content": "(a \"carpe vita tua\" [\"seize your life\"] film review by Timothy J. Verret)\n\nOnce again, God has the most impeccable timing of bringing me films to see at EXACTLY the impeccable timing God wants me to see them. This is the case in point of my watching of DEAD POETS SOCIETY. It's a film about \"carpe diem\" (\"seize the day\") but for me, the film elevates the viewer to \"carpe vita tua\" (\"seize your life\") while one still has all those \"days to seize\" of one's inevitably short life.\n\nDEAD POETS SOCIETY is directed by Peter Weir (WITNESS [1985] and FEARLESS [1993]) and stars Robin Williams as a very unorthodox teacher, John Keating, in a very orthodox school, and features a cast of very talented young actors. The students have never been taught by anyone quite like Keating. The first day in Keating's class, Keating has every student rip out (actually, tear and shred) the pages of the introduction, \"Understanding Poetry,\" to the book they will be studying. Keating in his unorthodox teaching proceeds to help each and every student find their own voice not only in poetry but also in their own lives. This is vital because there are three students highlighted in this film who need to find their voices. There is Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) who wants to be an actor though his father wants him to be anything but an actor. There is Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles) who wants the most beautiful girl he ever saw to fall in love him even though she is way out of his league. And then there is Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) who is painfully shy and feels a deep sense of low self-worth (boy, can I identify with that!). It's Anderson, in particular, of great interest to me, because what Keating is able to teach Anderson is something Keating teaches all of us, i.e., \"carpe vita tua\" (\"seize your life\").\n\nThe late Robin Williams is who we all know (knew) and love (loved), and his performance in DEAD POETS SOCIETY is unlike anything Williams has (had) shown us before. The \"manic\" Williams is the \"merciful\" Keating in Williams' great performance in this film. John Keating teaches unorthodox methods that the faculty deem careless and irresponsible. What the faculty can't grasp is that the rigid rules and regulations they impose on their students is what will impose on their students conforming to rigid rules and regulations and, basically, their students becoming robots. But that's what the faculty wants, i.e., they want robots because then they won't be challenged when it comes to their rigid rules and regulations. In school or not, the world wants robots, too. Robots have no freedom to be who they are created by God to be. A school (or a world) that turns out robots at graduation is a school (or a world) that turns out robots to live robotic lives. Keating won't have that imposed on his students, and he goes to great lengths to ensure his students are exactly who God created them to be, i.e., precious and free. Keating probably wouldn't admit he's doing God's Work in DEAD POETS SOCIETY, but this is EXACTLY what Keating is doing, i.e., doing God's Work with his students to teach them, \"do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is\u2014his good, pleasing and perfect will\" (Romans 12:2). Keating is \"good, pleasing, and perfect\" to God for Keating is doing God's Will with God's Students.\n\nPerry auditions for a play and gets the role of Puck in William Shakespeare's A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM. Sidebar: As an actor myself, I remember doing a Puck soliloquy in an acting class and because my elements are fire and wind, Puck's elements, one of the students in my class exclaimed, \"Timothy, that's the best Puck I've ever seen!\" Perry defies his father by playing free-spirited Puck and because of this, Perry's NOT free-spirited father tells Perry he will be leaving this orthodox school to go into another orthodox military academy. Perry can't accept the caged \"orthodox life\" that Keating taught him never to live, so Perry accepts the free \"unorthodox death.\" Overstreet conforms not to this world and pursues his romantic interests toward the most beautiful girl he ever saw and in a very touching scene, when Overstreet is in the audience next to her watching Perry in his play and grabs for her hand and probably because of the spell the play casts, she's led to grasp Overstreet's hand right back. And then there is Anderson. Thank God director Weir understands that Anderson is his shining \"pupil\" in DEAD POETS SOCIETY. When Keating is let go from his teaching position, it is Anderson who makes the first move to not conform to this decision. One of Keating's teaching methods was to have each of his students stand on a desk so they could get a newer and better perspective on their lives from Up There. When Keating is leaving the class for the last time, it is Anderson who is the first one who stands up on his desk and says to Keating, \"O Captain, my Captain\" (from a poem by Walt Whitman, what Keating taught his students to call him). It is also Anderson who director Weir gives us as the final image of the film, so that we are left with, \"Anderson, O Captain, my Captain, we see you up on that desk from where we are sitting, and we join you Up There!\" Anderson is now \"carpe diem\" (\"seize the day\") when Keating leaves but, more importantly in that final image now and forever, Anderson is \"carpe vita tua\" (\"seize your life\").\n\nWith an Oscar-winning screenplay by Tom Schulman, DEAD POETS SOCIETY is a film where we are all invited to graduate, in school or not, to a higher plane in life and a higher life on a plane of \"seizing your life.\" It is a film that invites us to be fearless, daring, courageous, to \"not conform to this world but renew your mind.\" Robin Williams in an inspiring performance gives us John Keating who takes the minds and hearts of each of his students and gives them an \"O Captain, my Captain\" who they can follow to nonconformity, In doing so, we also can follow Keating, in school or not, to leave behind our robotic lives and discover what is God's \"good, pleasing and perfect will,\" and this will is to \"seize our lives\" and NOT be held captive to any \"O Captain, my Captain\" who wants to teach us to conform.\n\n\"Rules were made to be broken.\" Indeed, they were! But we don't break rules just to break them. We break rules to be taught by God (and Keating) that we \"break free\" from conformity, because we won't be robots for anyone when we \"seize your life.\"",

And there were certain parallels that reminded me of how Williams could be an exceptionally inspiring actor given the right script and setting.\n\nIt would have been nice to have had a bit more backstory of the father to Neil, so as to fully appreciate why he was so determined to give his son the best opportunities that he never had. Instead all we get is \"We're not a rich family. I only want the best for you. I never had what you have right now!\" And therefore comes across as a stern & embittered disciplinarian of a father, whereas I felt with a bit more story we might have learnt why he was so determined to see his son succeed in the way he probably didn't.\n\nThe ending itself is of course one of those great Hollywood moments that will be remembered more than the film itself. Very much a bittersweet conclusion, with some of the boys finally realising their true potential in life when they abide by Williams' advice and \"seize the moment\"",

The late, great Williams, who was emotionally affected by a divorce he was going through at the time, is as likeable here as ever, and despite his limited screen time, he dominates the scenes he's in, and while his usually explosive comedic persona is noticeably reigned in here, he still gets most of the films funniest lines. His unique teaching style and reluctance to adhere to convention is what earns him the respect and adoration of his students, and while they question what he says throughout, they do grasp the central theme, and that's what makes his teaching so compelling. It's all about being an individual, and viewing poetry as a means of self-expression, not just regurgitating lines of dialogue and analysing them. Things slow down considerably in the 3rd act, but the final scene is an all-time classic, and once its over its hard not to have a smile on your face. It's a standout film in Robin William's oeuvre, and one that, as usual, he completely made his own.",

It's about integrating the ideas in poetry with the rest of your 'real' physical life. Taking risks and having fun, feeling it. That's great subject matter.\nIt really is a shame in some ways that this takes place in an all boys (and pretty much completely white) rich school. The story doesn't really require that.

I was born on the year the movie was released, also I watched it with my little brother, who is a high school senior, and I watched it less than a week after a friend committed suicide, just days after a student told me she was having suicidal thoughts, with the added detail of Robin Williams' suicide tying a macabre bow on the whole experience for me. With all that being said, you would think that I could give it a higher score but the fact is it feels somewhat dated. I know it's set in 1959 but what I mean is the interactions between some of the characters just don't ring true for me, the boys act in over-the-top fashion over their love for poetry and for each other that at times it rings of falsity and performance. There are some good moments throughout however and the story is certainly quite moving, especially to me, at this particular point in my life, it truly hit a nerve. I'd been wanting to watch it for years, and it was well worth the wait to watch it right after my first week of English teaching. I actually ended up having one of my classes read an excerpt from Walden from their textbooks the very next day, the same one Mr.Keating uses to inspire his students to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life; To put to rout all that was not life; and not, when I had come to die, discover that I had not lived.",

            "content": "Oh, how I yearned for The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969) while watching this saccharine, trite film that portrays teachers as saintly figures without humanity rather than the complex figures they are in almost everyone's lives. I also had difficulty swallowing the film's thin credo when it was being doled out by Robin Williams who has always repelled me despite how beloved he is by some. Adding to my anger at the film was the knowledge that it earned the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay over the timeless Nora Ephron screenplay for When Harry Met Sally\u2026 (1989). This was not one of the best films of 1989, a fairly stacked year, as Enemies, A Love Story (1989), Say Anything\u2026 (1989) and Drugstore Cowboy (1989) were far more memorable and affecting.\n\nUnconventional teacher John Keating, Robin Williams, disrupts the lives of his students at Welton Academy as he forces them to embrace poetry and do whatever they want because of the credos he pushes on them. The boys are negatively affected as Neil Perry, Robert Sean Leonard, decides to appear in a play against the wishes of his father Thomas, Kurtwood Smith, leading to disastrous consequences. He does allow the shy Todd Anderson, Ethan Hawke, to come out of his shell by embarrassing him and forcing him to make up a poem in front of his classmates. The other student in the group who receives their own subplot is Knox Overstreet, Josh Charles, who falls in love with blonde cheerleader Chris Noel, Alexandra Powers, despite her being in a committed relationship. In the end the boys stand up for the teacher who has brainwashed them with a symbolic gesture but he is still fired due to their actions.\n\nWilliams is so manic and intense in his performance while never quite convincing you that his character is genuine in his desire to educate these young men that it is difficult to follow him. We don't see what would inspire such devotion in this group of boys as they seem more like fevered cult members than diligent students. We are clearly meant to be charmed by the antics of the lead character but Williams is more annoying than hilarious or witty and we find ourselves turned off by his constant calls to action and attempts to turn these young men into radicals. I can't say the rest of the cast are of any particular note as Hawke and Leonard fill their roles nicely but don't stand out like Pamela Franklin or Lee Grant in far more original films. \n\nFrom there the rest of the film doesn't quite work as \"Carpe diem\" sounds less inspiring coming out of the mouth of a man who we are never really drawn to. The Tom Schulman screenplay doesn't help as it fails to be truly inspiring and instead inserts cheap platitudes in favor of scenes that would really explore youthful angst and the negative influence of a repressive society. The concerns of the boys also seem trivial while the film treats them as though they are paramount. If the film were to be made today Perry and Anderson would definitely be homosexual and while I understand why that would not have been a plot point in a mainstream film from 1989 I do think this would have been a more compelling struggle. The tragic event that punctuates the film was unearned and I felt horribly emotionally manipulated as the film portrays a confused teenager as a martyr for his beliefs. The only fascinating touch added to the scene is that Weir allows us to witness the devastated expression on Perry's father's face and just for a moment the film explore a difficult issue with some depth and perception.\n\nIt's unfortunate that many love this film and hold it up as being genuinely inspirational when it is so fake and manufactured. Peter Weir is a director capable of producing films with real emotional and dramatic heft such as The Truman Show (1998) and Fearless (1993) but his talents are no use when he is working with such a phony script and while the film may look good it has little to say. This is not one worth devoting over two hours of your time to.",

The general plot of this movie where poetry channels these young boys' brains to use their imagination and chase what they feel and express it through the art form is beautiful. Before I didn't see poetry as deep and meaningful as I now see it. With professor Keating's impact and effect that were left on these young men really shows how just being a caring person and guiding people can show true leadership even if that means allowing those under him to follow their own path and even disobey authority, if it is what is best for them.

I think he was the best actor in this film and especially in the scene that gets his students to respect him, all stand in the folders and they all say: \"O captain, my captain\".\n\nIn the years of 1959, Todd Anderson begins his senior year of high school at Welton Academy, an all-male, elite preparatory school. He was assigned one of Welton's most promising students, Neil Perry, as his roommate and is quickly accepted by Neil's friends: Knox Overstreet, Richard Cameron, Steven Meeks, Gerard Pitts, and Charlie Dalton. On the first day of classes, they were surprised by the unorthodox teaching methods of the new English teacher, but he teach them also poetry; John Keating, he encourages his students to \"make your lives extraordinary\", a sentiment he summarizes with the Latin expression carpe diem. \nI think this is a extraordinary story because this movie comes to teach you a lot about how to look and live your life.\n\nNow I'm going to talk about the soundtrack, which I consider extraordinary because it fit perfectly in the scenes of the film. For me one of the best scenes or better said the best scene is when they dismiss Mr. Keating and his students out of respect they stand in the folders and say \"O captain, my captain\".\n\nFinally, I will put 10 of 10 to this movie because I think this movie is one of best of the history and actually is a classic film, I think that fans will be so happy to see this movie, and also they could learn something watching this movie. I recommend people to see this movie to have a good time and to remember a classic.  \n\nBy: Gabriel Morales",

Though the background is different, education focused on college entrance exam is very similar to the current reality of education in Korea, which made me sympathetic. Charismatic and comfortable image of Robin Williams, who played the role of John Keating in the movie, gave us a better sense of immersion in the character of John Keating. However, there were some disappointing scenes for me reading the novel first. Neil Perry's father and the principal were portrayed as much more daunting and scary in the novel, but slightly less expected in the movie. Also, when Todd Anderson signed in the principal's office, he had a big fight with his parents in the novel, but it was not portrayed in the movie. There were some parts of the novel that made the connection awkward.

However, the school authority considers the Dead Poets Society disobedience of students, strictly punishes the students involved, and fire Mr. Keating who let the students learn about it. But students follow him, resisting and shouting \"Oh, captain, My Captain!!\" to the end of the movie. The school reminded me of America, which was under a lot of Reagan's oppression, and Keating and the main characters were like liberals against it. This story can also be compared to South Korea, whose education is focused on college entrance exams. Neil's parents seem to represent Korean parents, who prevent their children from doing what they want to do and encourage them to do what for their future stability. And the director is critical of the education in reality through this movie.

Its all about being a free thinker and not giving in to conformity. It is truly profound. There is only one slight issue that I have with this movie and it is the random romance between one of the boys and some random girl. It comes off as creepy and really forced into the story. The romance added nothing to the movie, rather it detracted in my opinion. The girl was just not a fleshed out character, nor do I think she necessarily needed to be. The romance really distracted from the story being told. The rest of the film is amazing and rather flawless. The ending scene is one of the more powerful scenes I have seen. Highly recommend",

            "content": "The movie Dead Poets Society is about a new english teacher, Mr. Keating (Robin Williams) teaches his students unorthodox methods at an all boys preparatory school, Welton Academy, that is known for its high standards and traditions.  The boys at the school face some extreme pressures from the school and their own parents expectations.  Mr. Keating inspires the boys through these methods especially Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) and others to pursue their dreams, conquer their fears and seize the day.   This is supported by the storyline, characters, and the conflict, amongst the characters. \nCarpe Diem is demonstrated through the whole storyline of Dead Poets Society in several series of events.  The first scene where the boys of Welton Academy meet their new english teacher, was very crucial.  Mr. Keating told and expressed what poetry truly is and how the schools way of teaching it was wrong and demeaning.  He said,\"I always thought the idea of education was to learn to think for yourself.\"  He wants to teach the boys to take advantage of their life and to seize the day.  He teaches the students to look at the world through a different point of view, with poetry and just in general.  He inspired the boys, and at the end of the movie, the boys especially Neil Perry and Todd Anderson, to accomplish their dreams and to conquer their fears.  Todd Anderson had severe anxiety speaking up in front of others.  When the Dead Poet's group was to be claimed as Mr. Keating's fault, Todd stood up.  Mr. Keating inspired the boys with \"Carpe Diem\" throughout the entire movie of Dead Poets Society.  \nThe characters in Dead Poets Society are pushed to conquer their daily challenges and the societies struggles through carpe diem.  Neil Perry yearns to become an actor but doesn't have enough courage to stand up to his father.  He once said, \"I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life. To put to rout all that was not life; and not, when I had come to die, discover that I had not lived.\" He has realized that he wants to overcome his parents expectations and he wants to live life at its fullest.  Mr. Keating inspires Neil to face his family and to fulfill his dream instead of his parents dream for him.  Todd Anderson is a new student at Welton Academy and very introverted.  Neil helps Todd to get enough courage to stand up to himself.  Neil's suicide helps Todd push through it all and he was finally able to stand up to Mr. Nolan.  Todd said gets up on his desk and says,\"Oh captain, my captain\" which later the whole class joined him.  Mr. Keating, earlier in the movie taught the boys that poem and that was the first scene that truly inspired the boys about poetry.  Todd had extreme anxiety about speaking up, so when he stood up for Mr. Keating, he truly conquered his fear which was Mr. Keating's goal.  Both Neil and Todd struggled on a daily basis with their expectations and fears.  Mr. Keating taught them \"Carpe Diem\"- to seize the day- which led them to conquer their challenges. \nThere are a couple of problems between the school, society, and relationships, that will be fixed with just the thought of seizing the day for the better.  At Welton Academy, the students are taught to obey authorities and internalize whatever knowledge their teachers pass on from older traditions.  Mr. Keating's way of teaching is to think for yourself and to seize the day.  His teaching methods are unusual compared to the standards of 1950's.  He gets the students to get up on their desk to look at the world at a different perspective.  He asks his students,\"why do I stand up here?\" He later answered with,\"I stand upon my desk to remind myself that we must constantly look at things in a different way.\"  This truly inspires the boys to not only look at things differently such as poetry, but to conquer the high standards and traditions that the school forces upon the boys of Welton Academy.  The boys have conflicts with the school and also their parents.  Neil Perry is extremely intimidated by his father, who wants Neil to become a doctor.  Their biggest conflict is their lack of communication, Mr. Perry wanted what best for his son, and Neil wanted to find out who he was.  Their last fight they had Mr. Perry says,\"I don't know why you insist on defying us.\"  Neil couldn't find the words to express his opinions with his father and Mr. Perry was unwilling to look at what his son wanted in life.  Dead Poets Society is filled with complications, and conflicts between the school and relationships.  Mr. Keating helps with all of these challenges by teaching the boys to seize the day.\nOn the other hand, some might say that Mr. Keating doesn't allow his students much original thought.  For example, Mr. Keating makes the students rip out pages in the book they're studying for because he doesn't believe in it.  That they were forced to learn the way he wanted them to learn.  However, he also had the boys get upon his desk and look at the world through a different point of view.  Everyone looks at things in different ways than the next, and Mr. Keating can't control that.  He wanted the boys to get their own opinion and original thought.  He doesn't want to control their lives anymore than what Welton Academy does.  Mr. Keating said,\"You must strive to find your own voice because the longer you wait to begin, the less likely you are going to find it at all.\"  He wants the boys to strive, to pursue their dreams, to conquer their fears, and to seize the day.\nCarpe Diem has helped the characters of Dead Poets Society to live in the moment, stand up for their beliefs and passions, and conquer their fears through many obstacles in their lives.  This movie inspired many people across the nation to seize the day for the greater good.  Mr. Keating didn't only change the boys lives but changed the tradition of the strict rules that the school forces upon the boys.  The conflicts in Dead Poets Society cause the boys some extreme stress and the lesson that Mr. Keating teaches about seizing the day and living in the present helped the boys handle the stress and conquer their fears.  Mr. Keating was a huge impact on the boys of Welton Academy, in the same way Robin Williams impacted the world with this role. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnotated Bibliography: Dead Poets Society\nDead Poets Society. Dir. Peter Weir. Perf. Robin Williams. Buena Vista Pictures Distribution,\n1989.  Drama\nA new English teacher, Mr. Keating (Robin Williams) uses unorthodox methods to reach out to his students who face enormous pressures from their parents and the school itself.  The main theme of the film is mentioned several times throughout the film,\"Carpe diem, seize the day\" meaning to make their lives extraordinary.  The director, Peter Weir, illustrates that risk taking and living life to the fullest can lead in happiness and contentment and can inspire others.  He also illustrates how external pressures can influence young adults.  The film is aimed at a teenage to adult audience. \nDettmar, Kevin J.H. \"Dead Poets Society Is a Terrible Defense of the Humanities.\" The Atlantic,\nAtlantic Media Company, 19 Feb. 2014, www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/02/-em-dead-poets-society-em-is-a-terrible-defense-of-the-humanities/283853/\nThe author, Kevin J.H. Dettmar, very strongly dislikes this film for a couple different reasons.  He is an english teacher himself and believes that it portrays his profession misleading.  All of his sources are based on opinion and things that happened to himself which leads to why he hates this movie so much.  He says,\"Keating actually allows his students very little opportunity for original thought\" and he supports this by the way Keating taught one of his lessons.  The author says that when the boys march up to Mr. Keating's desk, they were told to look at a different point of view, but Keatings different point of view.  I believe otherwise, Mr. Keating teaches them how to just simply look at the same classroom just in a different way.  This could be a good counterclaim in my essay.\nManzoor, Sarfraz. \"My Favourite Film: Dead Poets Society.\" The Guardian, Guardian\nNews and Media, 21 Nov. 2011,\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/nov/21/favourite-film-dead-poets-society                                                \nSarfraz Manzoor, believes that this film inspired him in a time he needed it most.  He says it has the power to inspire and embolden you.  He related his life to some events and symbols that happened in the film.  He was able to get enough courage to stand for what he wanted, just from the simple words \"carpe diem\".  Those words in the film alone give power and inspiration, Mr. Keating on the other hand had the biggest influence on not only the boys, but the audience as well.  \nHowe, Desson. \"Dead Poets Society.\" The Washington Post, WP Company, 9 June 1989, www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/deadpoetssocietypghowe_a0b21e.htm.\nDesson Howe connected Robin William himself to the idea of poetry.  Even though Robin Williams isn't on screen half the time, he still has a huge influence on the boys and us watching the film.  Poetry is the same, it influences and leaves an impression especially on the boys.  He is more on the positive side of the reviewers.  He admires Robin Williams in many different ways:  Acting abilities, influences, impressions, and such a kind soul.   Desson Howe says that Mr. Keating has the boys question conventional thinking by doing various activities like standing up on the desk to look at another perspective, or tearing out paper from the poetry book that he learned from and has derailed.  \nEbert, Roger. \"Dead Poets Society Movie Review (1989) | Roger Ebert.\"\nRogerEbert.com, Steven Haft, 9 June 1989, www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dead-poets-society-1989.\nRoger Ebert felt such a strong feeling when the boys stood up at the end of the movie on their desks to let Mr. Keating know that they are on his side, and are there for him.  He believes that the movie just shows how the kids love their teacher and not about poetry at all.  He likes the movie overall just thinks that the director's purpose wasn't portrayed correctly.  He then relates Robin William to some of his other films, which to me is irrelevant because he did a phenomenal job acting as an intelligent, quick witted, poetry teacher.",

            "content": "Dead Poets Society: \"Seizing the Day\" One Heartstring at a Time\nDead Poets Society will leave you feeling like you can seize more than just your day. If there had ever been a movie that urges you to feel every possible emotion, Dead Poets Society would be that film. Not only is it solemn and heartbreaking, it is witty and empowering.\n\tSet in the Northeast in the latter end of the 1950's, Dead Poets Society is about a group of students at an all-boys prep school, Welton Academy. Welton is an extremely elite and conservative academy with strict rules, leaving no room for nonsense. Any attempt at frivolity is squandered by stern parents or high-strung faculty. The lives of the group of students is altered when they meet their English professor, John Keating (Robin Williams). John Keating, an alumnus of Welton, is a poetry loving, independent thinking activist, who expands the minds of his students through his unorthodox teaching methods. Through those unorthodox teaching methods, Keating instills in the group of students the mindset of \"carpe diem\", or \"seize the day\". The \"seize the day\" mindset really comes into play in the students' lives when they revive an old school club that Keating founded during his time as a student, the Dead Poets Society. The Dead Poets Society is a group that meets to, \"suck the marrow out of life\" through poetry. Through the experiences that the group of students has with the freshly revived Dead Poets Society and their beloved professor John Keating, this group of formerly humdrum students begin to learn what it means to really live life.\n\tMajor themes of the movie include independent thinking, benefits of non-conformity, and carpe diem (seize the day). All of the major themes of the movie are represented in a smaller way through certain teaching exercises of John Keating. For example, the theme of independent thinking is represented at the beginning of the new semester. He has the students tear out the introduction of their poetry textbook on the grounds that he believes the authors views on poetry are, \"excrement.\" The theme of non-conformity is represented during one scene of the film when Keating takes the class outside to the courtyard. He has each student walk in their own unique way to demonstrate the point that everyone has their own way of doing things. When one of the students chooses to stand in place as opposed to walking with the rest of the class, Keating's response is, \"thank you...you just illustrated the point. Swim against the stream.\" \nDead Poets Society is reminiscent of other \"inspiring teacher movies\" such as Mr. Holland's Opus or Freedom Writers, in the way that in the beginning the authoritative figure isn't necessarily well received. The students don't necessarily connect with the teacher right in the beginning, but over time, the teacher is able to uplift and inspire those in their sphere of influence.\nThe director of Dead Poets Society, Peter Weir, could not have had a better compliment to the film than having Robin Williams. Robin Williams was absolutely magnificent as the English professor John Keating. Compared to other films that Robin Williams has acted in such as Good Will Hunting and Mrs. Doubtfire, he received relatively small amounts of screen time. However, the smaller amount of screen time did not hinder the film or his performance, it enhanced it. Even with Williams not eating up the screen time, he still managed to beautifully commandeer the film. Robin Williams made you feel as though John Keating was worthy enough to enroll yourself at Welton Academy just so you could find out for yourself what exactly it means to \"seize the day.\"\n\tDead Poets Society leaves you feeling as though there is much more to life than has previously met your eye. For those who feel they are in a stagnant rut of life, one of going through the motions and conforming to society, Dead Poets Society is the chicken soup for your soul. Upon finishing the movie, I feel like I have a lot of life in me to give. This movie will influence your thinking in a way that you will not want to just do life, but to actually live life.",

            "content": "A movie becomes iconic if it changes the way that you think and influences viewers to feel powerful emotions. Dead Poets Society undoubtedly succeeds in accomplishing these two things. Thousands of viewers over the past couple decades have been affected by the moving messages that are shared in this award-winning movie, but there are some elements of character and plot development that were not executed quite as well as they could have been. The promenade of pretty monologues greatly affect this movie in that they seek to mask these developmental errors.\n\nThis emblematic coming of age film takes place in a posh all-boys school in New England. Set in the late 1950's, Welton Academy is traditional and very serious until alumnus John Keating (Robin Williams)  is hired to be the new English professor. On the first day of class, Keating takes the students on a field trip to a display case and instills in their minds the urgency of \"carpe diem\". This initial scene includes an aforementioned pretty monologue' that rolls like liquid gold off of Mr. Keating's tongue and into the ears and hearts of student and audience member alike. This speech is excellently performed by Williams, however there is something about it that doesn't quite sit right. The creepy way that he whispers \"carpe diem\" and the fact that he has the boys lean uncomfortably close to the pictures reminds us how little we actually know about Keating's curious background as a former student at Welton. The mystery develops throughout the movie as the boys discover Mr. Keating's involvement with the original Dead Poets Society. Though this beginning monologue is powerful and will motivate you to seize the day, the wacky undertones allude to a cryptic past that begs to be explained, but is not made clear in the movie. \n\nThe story continues with well-worded inspiring passages scattered throughout every other scene or so and the boys begin to adjust their lives to more fully seize the day. One student, Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles) becomes a hopeless romantic as he pursues a girl he hardly even knows, Chris. Knox takes many risks to try to woo Chris, including sneaking off of school property and riding his bike to town just to stare at her awkwardly from afar. This covetous behavior reaches its climax at a party, where drunken Knox \"makes a move\" on Chris and then gets punched several times by Chris' overprotective boyfriend Chet. Mr. Keating condones Knox's actions and tells the students that, \"the purpose of language is to woo women.\" Knox proceeds to write a cheesy poem which he delivers to Chris and the entire scene is overdone and cliche. While a coming of age movie is not truly complete without a romance, the relationship between Knox and Chris could have been developed in a way that was more unique, and Knox's character development could have been more relatable.\n\nNeil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) decides to implement Mr. Keating's teachings by auditioning for a play, despite his father's disapproval. He gets the role as Puck in Midsummer Night's Dream which sparks an argument between him and his father and Neil goes to Mr. Keating to find guidance. Mr. Keating shares beautifully phrased counsel telling Neil that he should confront his father and tell him how passionate he is about acting. Neil attempts to communicate how he feels to his father, but is unsuccessful. This contention eventually leads to Mr. Perry threatening to take Neil out of Welton Academy and enroll him in a military school. Neil, feeling trapped, decides to commit suicide. After reviewing the events leading up to Neil's death it may seem plausible for him to take this course of action, however most audience members are left feeling confused at how the situation escalated so quickly. It seems like at one second the advice that Mr. Keating has given will mend the relationship between father and son, but then all of the sudden Neil is dead. As I have talked to other people about this movie, the most common observation I hear is that Neil's suicide doesn't make sense. If the movie had done a more thorough job of foreshadowing the death, or developing more grievous circumstances, perhaps this plot hole would not be as evident to audience members.\n\nIn its entirety, Dead Poets Society promotes an enhanced perspective on life that we all like to hear . It challenges us to seize the day and adopt a contemplative mindset. However the way this message is addressed could use some work. The monologues are wonderfully worded, but it seems that they only serve to masquerade over the fact that there are both character and plot development flaws in the movie. Unlike the poetry that these boys drool over, this movie is nothing but a people-pleasing prose parade.",

A big part of it is that Robin Williams is so wonderful as the teacher who inspires these young men to live their lives to the fullest. I find myself so enthralled in the struggles of all these characters after his amazing speeches serve as an inciting incident. Then I just sit in awe as I watch how each boy is changed (or not changed) by the events in the film. There are so many scenes that I find impactful, and I could watch them completely independent of the rest of the movie and they would still give me chills or bring me to tears. If I were to make any complaint it would be a nitpick, but it would probably be that there seems to be a few scenes missing that could more effectively work through the arc of Ethan Hawke\u2019s character. There are a few moments that don\u2019t seem fully earned, because he\u2019s not the most active player in the events of the film even though he is treated like a protagonist. I don\u2019t notice it, though, because I find Dead Poets Society to be so thoroughly enjoyable in all other ways. I never would have thought that a movie so heavily focused on poetry would be one of my all-time favorites, but it is so powerful that I find myself wanting to read poems even though I hated that stuff when I was in school. It takes a special kind of movie to inspire an audience member to seek out things that he ordinarily dislikes. ",

I'm going to treat you to some of my favourite quotes from the film.\n\n\"No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world.\"\n\n\"Boys, you must strive to find your own voice. Because the longer you wait to begin, the less likely you are to find it at all. Thoreau said, \"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.\" Don't be resigned to that. Break out!\"\n\n\"We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman, \"O me! O life!... of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless... of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life?\" Answer. That you are here - that life exists, and identity; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play *goes on* and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?\"\n\nhttps://rwh92.wordpress.com/",

Robin Williams delivered his greatest performance and molded the film to near perfection. At the time of filming Williams was going through a painful divorce. Possibly this was just one of the factors that made his performance so endearing and believable. So many films have been made of the \"high school\" years yet Dead Poets Society is the diamond in the rough. We'll say Fast Times at Ridgemont High is the emerald or dirty diamond. Anyway, the film is loaded with talented actors and backed by a story that will never leave your mind. Each character has their own soul and together they form a story equal to Shawshank Redemption. A movie I feel is the greatest screenplay of all time (sorry Chinatown). Thiss film made me quit football my senior year and try acting in plays, just to see if I could. I would recommend this film to all and any. Films may rate highest at a five but Dead Poets Society is a perfect 5. Good watching!",
