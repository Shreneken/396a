            "content": "\ud83c\udfb5 It's the Time of the Gypsies\nWhen the Love Runs High \ud83c\udfb5 \n\nThis is only the second film I've seen from Serbian director Emir Kusturica (after Underground), but a pattern is starting to emerge in his work stylistically, focusing on tragicomic magic realism and stories driven through character interaction as much as plot. Time of the Gypsies is nominally about the evolution of a single character, but is representative of a larger social community (its idiosyncrasies, charms, and struggles). The writer-director really comes into his own with the way he integrates very human interpretations to both individual people as well as his storytelling - Davor Dujmovi\u0107's Perhan is not a perfect individual by any means, but that does not make his suffering any less empathetic. Simultaneously, the screenplay is constantly genre-hopping with the shifts in tone, bouncing back and forth between pure drama and surprisingly visual comedy. All the while there is the consistent possibility that the surrealism introduced at the beginning of the film will wind its way back to the front of the camera, imparting a degree of unpredictability. \n\nDid Kusturica inspire Hideo Kojima to include the cardboard box as a disguise in the Metal Gear Solid series? We can only guess, but I like to think that yes, the Japanese game developer has a soft spot for Serbian cinema that he wanted to reference in his stealth action series. (4/5)",

The story might be the usual rags-to-rich-gangster arc but what made this movie was the sheer inventiveness of the filmmaking. The photography was out-of-this-world brilliant, where I could've just stared at every frame. The characters all had their little (or not so little) bizarre tics to them, and Kusturica gave the entire film an aura of surrealism that made the experience unique. It was really the strangeness of the movie that made the most impact on me and elevated the drama. It also made for a lot of humor. As pure (intentional) comedy, it was as funny as anything out there, but the moments of sadness also rang true. The cast was uniformly excellent, even the main character's naive love interest, who is certainly not the most accomplished thespian but actually used that to her advantage to communicate innocence. Others have called it overly challenging and dramatic, but I think it was very fun to watch as pure entertainment as well, with the same sort of quick pace as, say, late period Scorsese.",
