    "summary": "At a fading vacation resort, 11-year-old Sophie treasures rare time together with her loving and idealistic father, Calum (Paul Mescal). As a world of adolescence creeps into view, beyond her eye Calum struggles under the weight of life outside of fatherhood. Twenty years later, Sophie's tender recollections of their last holiday become a powerful and heartrending portrait of their relationship, as she tries to reconcile the father she knew with the man she didn't, in Charlotte Wells' superb and searingly emotional debut film.",

            "content": "We bought into the hype.  It wasn't the worst movie we've ever seen, but it was in the vein as Manchester by the Sea - no beginning, no story, no real ending.  If you liked that, you might like this.  \n\nThe acting *is* good, but it is disturbingly slow and the flashing lights scenes made my head hurt. If you're prone to migraines, you might want to pass. \n\nGlad we rented and didn't buy it. Wont watch it again and wont recommend it.",

It's a quietly emotional film with multiple small, heartbreaking bits of mental health reality woven into what should have been just another childhood vacation memory. I do think the movie speaks louder and more true to those personally familiar with the crushing struggle of deep depression, but it's equally interesting and actually important for others to see the effort Dad puts into trying to just be \u2018normal', wearing that mask that anyone intimately aware will immediately recognize. The truth of all that  may feel a little uncomfortable as it slices in and out of the light moments but that seems to be the director's intention. I think it was beautifully acted and edited; the heavy heart you'll feel may help you to listen more carefully in your own life.",

            "content": "It's not often I outwardly want to review a movie, but I just wasted \u00a34.50 on renting this movie and I want to spare someone else the same fate. It's truly one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Think those artistic long dragging focus shots of banal things. For example, 3 mins of Mescal smoking a cigarette and moving around the balcony. 2 min shot of his breathing underneath a blanket. Just because a film is well acted and has a couple of artistic scenes, doesn't make it a good movie. There is no plot, and look vacation artsy movies can be good: The Descendants for example. This was just dull, boring, and thinks way too highly of itself. \n\nSo we're *Spoiler* watching a girl who in present tense is watching old footage of a holiday and remembering her dad when she was young. Although, this resort holiday she's remembering has absolutely no substance to it. \n\nHe's just a normal dad and she's a normal girl. They have nothing interesting about them, there's a total lack of plot. I don't know who this movie is for, other than just for people like Mescal, who is great, but for people like him to secure BAFTAs and emmys for a movie that realistically wasn't good but for art's sake we'll pretend it was so moving. \n\nAs I say, I can handle movies of this nature, The Descendants, Call Me By Your Name, etc, all holiday focused movies. But the difference with them was that there was 1) plot, and 2) the location was idyllic. \n\nThe only thing I think this movie probably invokes is just remembering to look back and remember how you love someone, and remember your family. Hold on to precious memories and youth. \n\nBut frankly, this movie has as much depth as a \"live laugh love\" wall sticker. And even then, at least that statement is clear and knows what it is.\n\nWhat is aftersun other than just another slow paced artsy film?",

Slow is one thing, but having the camera stare at blank space for a solid 60 seconds borders on insulting. Finally, one cannot help but acknowledge that this film would not have been successful if it were about a mother instead of a father. We continue to give grace to the emotional struggles of men where we are not prepared to hold such space for women.",

Calum (Paul Mescal) is a young father who springs for a holiday to an all-inclusive(ish) resort in Turkey with his daughter, Sophie (Frankie Corio). The resort seems to be occupied exclusively by citizens of the United Kingdom, Calum and Sophie being Scottish \u2014 their accents are one of the highlights of the film. Sophie is precocious and, like most eleven-year-olds, wants to hang out with the older kids. She's also perceptive to her father's money troubles, disclosing her insight in a moment that takes the wind out of you. Even in this buoyant atmosphere of turquoise waters, very 2000s arcade games, and pints of beer at the snap of a finger, a pall hangs over the resort. At first, it's that unstoppable sense of dread that \"all good things must come to an end,\" especially carefree vacations. But you eventually realize it's more than that. Calum is losing his daughter, but not in the \"my parents are lame and annoying\" way \u2014 in fact, it's Calum who shuns his daughter in what I can only describe as a preemptive strike. Instead, Calum knows the difficulties of co-parenting while being physically distant (I believe he lives in London, his ex up in Scotland?) while dealing with financial precariousness is too big a challenge to undertake. But it's your little girl, man. I don't know. Besides the few scenes of Sophie \"grown up\" (Celia Rowlson-Hall) and the dreamlike club scenes of her at the same age, we don't know what happened during that gap. Mescal and Corio really are excellent, but touching scene after touching scene and artistic camerawork (and the use of water) isn't enough to push this one higher.",

Memories you can see replayed on video, and memories 'existing' only as shards and flashes; fragile and fleeting. \"Aftersun\" is a fine bit of filmmaking, folks.\nDirector/writer Charlotte Wells already shows a level of skill and maturity beyond most any first-timer on a full-length movie. \nShe begns this exercise in memory and realizations, with the distinctive sound of a rewinding tape in the family's camcorder; like a rewinding of time itself. The video starts just precocious 11-year-old Sophie teases Calum about turning 31, a young father adrift but trying to project stability for her sake. These recorded clips of isolated candid interactions tell only part of the tale.\nSophie lives with her mother in Scotland, while Calum resides in London with no plans of moving back, means this holiday and the mental souvenirs derived from it matter gravely. Lean exposition comes in small doses offering only details relevant to this relationship, relying more on the remarkable chemistry between the two leads, whether hanging poolside or during casual conversations that turn into much more.\nAs an aesthetically innovative touch, Wells introduces shots that unfold in a dreamlike space, like a rave-type venue that we observe only in flashes of light, where adult Sophie  sees her father, still as a young man, from afar. She tries to reach him, as if chasing his memory in a physical space, but he repeatedly escapes her, shrouded in darkness. This is a clever visual means of showing us where Calum is in his head when Sophie's not around.\n\"Aftersun\" as a title refers to protection. As Calum repeatedly applies the sun lotion to protect her skin, he offers other means of help to protect her when he's not there. Take the lesson in escaping from an attacker's grasp. But it is not dealing with a parent's overprotection, but with the way they to help us walk on our own after they are no longer around.\nWell's writing brings out Calum's obvious love and care, but it is only so much protection, because he can't protect her from the harsh rays of life, but rather a nourishing and soothing balm for exposure to the inevitable pain of existence. In finding a deep compassion and empathy for her father, hopefully Sophie can make through her own waves to happiness and peace of mind. \nMescal and Corio are exceptional. He knocked me out in \"Normal People\" and continues to do the same in films. Frankie could be doing this for a long, long time. All the kinds (teens and otherwise) were  good, and Wells never plays them as dumb, bullies, or wastrels. \nNice work by editor McClendon in creating the memory collages along with the bits to use or not. And great stuff from the cinematography and visual effects. The rave club scenes were intense, disturbing, almost jarring\nThere's nothing good behind those doors, Calum.\n4 stars",

            "content": "I will go against the tide with AFTERSUN and say I don't think it's a great movie. Written and directed by Sophie Wells, AFTERSUN tells the story of Sophie (Frankie Corio) reflecting on a summer holiday with her father (Calum, played by Paul Mescal) 20 years before. She reflects on a few key moments from the holiday while trying to reconcile the difference between her father when she was 12 years old and the father she has come to know since. \n\nThe story is told partially through flashbacks and is primarily set in summertime, which gives the film a dreamy, nostalgic atmosphere. The cinematography captures the beauty of Turkey's landscapes with its sun-drenched beaches and vibrant colours. It's easy to feel immersed in Sophie's world as she reflects on her father, who was suffering from deep depression, which she was unaware of. \n\nUnfortunately, AFTERSUN fails to deliver a compelling story. The film's slow pace and lack of character development make it hard to connect with the characters. We don't get much insight into Sophie's life before or after her father, making it difficult to feel emotionally invested in their relationship. \n\nThe dialogue is often stilted and awkward, which I attribute to Wells's inexperience as a writer-director. She also relies too heavily on flashbacks which become tedious after a while due to the lack of depth in the characters.\n\nAFTERSUN also suffers from a lack of narrative drive. There are no real stakes or tension in the story, which is essential for any drama to be successful. The film meanders through Sophie's memories without really going anywhere and eventually ends with an abrupt and unsatisfying resolution. \n\nThe performances from Corio and Mescal are adequate but don't quite make up for the shortcomings in the script. Corio can capture Sophie's innocence and confusion as she reflects on her father's past. Mescal can also bring a sense of sadness and regret to the role, which helps make the relationship between Sophie and her father more believable. \n\nOverall, AFTERSUN falls short of being a compelling drama. It lacks narrative drive and character development and fails to tug at our heartstrings meaningfully. While it may have its moments of beauty, it doesn't quite make up for the lacklustre storytelling or overall experience.",

It's a film where nothing much happens but the beauty lies in the cracks, the small details that add up to a memorable film. This superb film is the debut feature for Charlotte Wells who also wrote this film. She has admitted it's semi autobiograpical and you can feel the personal touch flowing from the screen. It's about a relationship between 11 year old Sophie and her father Calum. They spend a week or so at a fading Turkish resort. It's no five star but rather a place where British families go to find a place in the sun. Most of the film is just Sophie and Calum hanging out, swimming in the pool, playing games, relaxing. Yes there is not much plot. But this film is about the connection between the two. As the film progresses we realise these are memories of a grown up Sophie. We also see Calum capturing the time on a video camera, offering a different perspective to the time spent. We also see small glimpses of Calum's financial and mental struggles. Without saying much more this is a very tender and meaningful look at depression. It's handled in such a way it really does impact emotionally. The two main leads are terrific. Paul Mescal proves he is a shooting star and Frankie Corio is wonderful as Sophie. It's also shot beautifully, there are many moments that will take your breath away. This is a film that requires more than casual observance. You need to pay attention to all the little signs. I think it's a stellar film that will become a modern classic.",

There's so much truth in the story. The emotions, the trivial details, the limited perspective of the narrator. It all feels very real.\n\nThe film centers around a vacation a father and daughter take together over the summer. We largely view what happens through the lens of the 11-year old daughter, who is grown up in the present day. The story is told through her memories, so the details are sometimes fuzzy. The camera is often pointed just a bit off from where the action is. She sees the effects of some of her father's struggles, but as a child, she never understands the reason for them.\n\nThere is a lovely scene where the father is in the bathroom, trying to cut off a cast. He accidentally cuts himself and draws blood. He sits there in pain, trying to clean up the blood, talking normally with his daughter in the other room, who is totally unaware. The camera shows a literal wall between them as they go on chatting. It's a beautiful picture of their father/daughter dynamics.\n\nThe characters contrast one another strongly: the girl excited about life and growing up, and all the hope that is before her; the father tired, in despair, unsure how he will go on. This makes everything different. She loves birthdays, he hates them. She looks at the sky and sees joy; he sees emptiness. She jumps in the water and sees the excitement of growing up, experiencing life; when he jumps in the water he experiences loss.\n\nThere's kind of a dream sequence throughout the film where the dad and the grown up daughter are at a club with a strobe light. We can only see snapshots. She is trying to get to him, but she can't. But when she finally does, he can't or won't engage with her. This upsets her. But there's nothing she can do.\n\nWhen the girl grows up, we imagine she understands her dad better. Some of the things she didn't understand as a child must be more clear. She probably has known similar disappointments to what he has faced. But as she tries to remember him, to remember that trip, she just has the video tape she took - shaky, out of focus, limited - and her memory, fractured and imperfect.\n\nIt's a beautiful story of love, life, understanding, and memory.\n\n(The movie also included some clear parallels to 2010's 'Somewhere,' - most obviously the dad's broken arm - another great dad-daughter vacation movie with similar themes and an ambiguous, though more hopeful ending.)",

We can sum up the plot of the first film by Charlotte Wells (one of the most brilliant debut in the last 15/20 years) with this simple phrase. But Aftersun is more than that. It's a story that plays with memories (the screenplay is half auto-biographical) of a joyous summer, which, if examined more closely, shows a world of human suffering and  in the enigmatic and heartbreaking figure of the father, interpreted by Paul Mescal, (nominated to the \"best actor\" category at the Oscars), who conveys to the spectator all the tensions and the doubts in a mind of a young parent. Too young for his role as a father, divorced, and not wealthy at all, he takes through the film many hidden questions that do not receive an answer. His future indeed is a blank paper. We don't know nothing about the years following the trip: the daughter has become a woman, with a wife and a baby, while father's story remains open-ended. As Mescal does, the young yet brilliant actress Francesca Corio works very well with the emotional side of the film, in a continous conflict between the joy and light-heartedness that a holiday takes and the concerns for her father: it's like the director let us mean she comprehends that, somehow, this will be her last holiday with his father. She clearly feels that. \nTo conclude, Aftersun deserves to be watched. You won't regret the choice.",

The film brings an intimate portrayal of a father's relationship with his daughter to the screen, whilst also capturing a holiday experience that British viewers will be all too familiar with. Wells draw on her own experiences for the film, with her own feelings and memories blending with fiction to create gut-wrenching emotion and a poignant story.\n\nThe film, set in the late 1990s, follows 11-year-old Sophie (Frankie Corio) and her father Calum (Paul Mescal) as they go on vacation together in Turkey. Sophie views the world differently to her father, being on the cusp of adolescence with her biggest worry being going back to school and doing her homework, while Calum sees the world under the weight of his declining mental health and responsibilities of being a father. Years later, Sophie is now an adult herself, and reminisces on the vacation she took with her father through both real and imagined memories, as well as rewatching DVR footage of their time abroad. With Calum seemingly no longer involved in Sophie's life, she reflects on the relationship she had with her father, seeing him in a new light with the knowledge and intelligence she now has as an adult.\n\nPaul Mescal delivers a spectacular performance as Calum, the Irishman acts with evocation and emotion, crafting a performance that is easily one of 2022's best, and very worthy of an Oscar nomination. Mescal and his 12-year-old co-star Frankie Corio, brilliantly bounce off each other's performances, creating an on-screen bond that feels incredibly real and intimate. They radiate youth and authenticity, with both performers working together to balance the powerful emotion with enjoyable humour. Corio, who makes her acting debut in the film, holds her own against her BAFTA-winning co-star, delivering an outstanding performance that effortlessly draws you into every scene.\n\nCinematographer George Oke, known for his work on short films like \"Alice\" and \"In a Room Below,\" works with Wells to craft delectable visuals for the film, with Oke's work skilfully exploring the film's themes, observing them through a warm-toned colour palette. As well as directing, Wells pens the screenplay for the film, producing a well-paced and empathetic screenplay that beautifully elevates both the film itself, as well as the performances. \"Aftersun\" covers a myriad of themes during its 102-minute runtime, from childhood and parenthood to memory and mental health, while also depicting a difficult relationship between a father and his daughter. The result of the film's sprawling themes coming together in harmony is a powerful drama that feels incredibly simple, while also being deeply complex, and packing an emotional punch for viewers.\n\n\"Aftersun\" is a sensational directorial debut from Charlotte Wells. Lead by knockout performances from Paul Mescal and Frankie Corio, the film is a profound drama that paints an intimate portrait of a father daughter relationship that tugs on your heartstrings. The film is accompanied by a wonderful score by Oliver Coates (\"Significant Other\"), that is full of melodic tones that work in harmony with each other. \"Aftersun\" forces its audiences to deal with feelings of love and loss, as well as a plethora of themes that will tug on your heartstrings and leave you teary-eyed by the time the credits roll. This is a film that quickly earns it spot among the year's best, from the performances to the technical aspects, everything works hand in hand to create a stellar film.",

An adult Sophie, on her birthday, looks back at twenty year old film footage of the last summer holiday in Turkey when she was 11 years old spent with her estranged father, Calum, played by Paul Mescal in his recent Best Actor Oscar-nominated role. Sophie (Frankie Corio) at age 11 is on the brink of adolescence trying to understand and come to terms with a father who is clearly loving, yet seems to be struggling beneath the weight of his life. Paul Mescal gives a realistic, tender and very understated performance, and young Frankie Corio is simply endearing as Sophie. The film, co-produced by Oscar-winning Director Barry Jenkins (\"Moonlight\"), leaves it up to the audience to decide the fate of Sophie's father at the end of AFTERSUN. The sense of melancholy I felt while watching the film left me with the understanding that for Sophie, 20 years of loss seems a lifetime, while her memories feel like only yesterday.",

It took me a long time to process these feelings and I will carry them with me as I move through my adult years, just as Sophie does. Frankie Corio depicts this painful erosion of innocence with a maturity and nuance well beyond her years. Paul Mescal delivers a mesmerizing performance that captures depression with graceful empathy and sobering bluntness - I have never wanted to yell at and hug someone so much through a screen before.

Apparently this is a yearly thing for them, some of the rare time they get to spend together as she lives in Edinburgh and he doesn't even live in Scotland. She takes random videos to memorialize the trip and he is\u2026 to put it mildly, EXTREMELY DEPRESSED. \n\nThis is never made explicit but Mescal somehow conveys this even in the first few (largely silent) minutes. \n\nInterspersed in the movie are (possibly seizure inducing) strobing shots of a concert? A mosh pit? A rave? It's all unclear. What becomes apparent though is that these scenes are in the future of the scenes we're watching in Turkey, far in the future when the daughter has grown up (now played by Celia Rowlson). \n\nHere's the issue though, the past scenes are the majority of the film. The future (or, more accurately, present day) scenes don't really say enough to say  anything in particular. In fact they have maybe 3 spoken lines in them. And the strobey scenes are so hard to decipher, they lend basically nothing to the narrative - except maybe they're supposed to be literal memory flashes? \n\nPaul Mescal is very good in this role, for what it's worth. And while it moves at what could charitably be called a languid pace, it managed to hold my attention just enough to not feel like watching a slide show of someone else's vacation.",

            "content": "It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work \u2013 aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story \u2013 is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The \"looking back in fondness\" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story. Considering all of the advance glowing reactions I had read about this release, I was really looking forward to it going in. Unfortunately, though, I came away from it almost as sad and disappointed as the protagonist herself.",

            "content": "I feel slightly like a movie philistine for my opinion concerning Aftersun. This indie drama has become one of the critical darlings of 2022, enough so that there may even be some serious Oscar buzz starting to foment. It's a movie with a strong beating heart and rich in authentic details and naturalistic performances, a movie that feels practically like a home video ripped from the past. However, while I appreciated the artistry on display, I kept waiting for the \"movie\" to form, the reason this story was given its big screen status. Aftersun is a lyrically felt movie but also one I wish had a more sustained plot to better develop its dramatic potential.\n\nIt's the mid 1990s and Sophie (Frankie Corio) is staying at a seaside Turkish resort with her father, Calum (Paul Mescal). Her parents are separated and she has a complicated relationship with her father, who covers up his own spiraling sadness by trying to be the \"fun dad.\" At eleven years of age, Sophie is feeling that awkward middle-ground of not being a child but still not being fully grown, and over her vacation, she observes her world and father with new eyes.\n\nThe strength of the movie is the richness of its characters and world, with each moment feeling like it was plucked straight from the memory of debut writer/director Charlotte Wells. The movie is framed as a home video of Sophie's and makes clever use of her narrating footage, allowing the perspective to be directed literally by its source. It's also interesting because there's a degree of performance for Sophie, as the presence of a camera usually goads people into acting differently, to play up to the camera, and this channels Sophie into being a goofy performer. Off camera, she's less prone to making jokes and being broad and silly. She jokes with her father, chiding him for his \"advanced age\" and other such topics, but there's more hesitancy and relatable awkwardness with Sophie in real life. Her dad says she should go introduce herself to other children at the resort, to make friends and have partners in play, and she scoffs that at eleven she's \"not a little kid anymore.\" She wants to hang out with the older teens and eavesdrop on their conversations, not fully aware of their meaning and context, as that hurried desire that young children have to cast aside their childhoods in favor of immediate maturity. There isn't any defining experience at this resort, no direct humiliation or formative wisdom to point to. It's more the small moments of a young girl between the different phases of her life. Sophie comes across as an achingly realistic portrayal of adolescence and the yearning for real connections.\n\nThe majority of the movie is about the relationship between father and daughter, and I was waiting for the movie to hit me hard, especially as I've recently become the stepfather to an eleven-year-old daughter. The relationship is there but there's nothing too demonstrative of what is going on between these two people. It's unclear whether this might be the last time Sophie will see her father for some time, or whether the divorce was recent and still a sore subject, or anything of extra significance. It just feels like a vacation, and that's as it's presented, and maybe that's the larger unspoken point of Wells, that the mundane moments only become more cherished in hindsight or when we realize they were the last moments before whatever happened.\n\nI think Wells might suspect the narrative on its own is missing that larger significance, so distributed throughout the movie are flashes from a rave with an older woman, and it's revealed later that this thirty-something woman is actually Sophie as an adult, and a new parent herself. This juxtaposition then serves as an ongoing film-length Kuleshov Effect. This cinematic effect, named after the Soviet filmmaker from one hundred years ago, reasons that placing two objects together forms an implicit connection or reaction, so seeing a picture of soup and then a man looking forward might convey hunger and a picture of a coffin and then a man looking forward might convey grief. By this juxtaposition, we're left to infer larger meaning and processing, as older Sophie is looking back on these scenes as distant memories. We're left to deduce what that means to her, what new insights she has as an adult looking back, and what has happened since, and I'm sure some viewers will find this a tantalizing human puzzle to unpack. For me, it felt like extra homework without the key elements to make the depictions dramatically involved.\n\nThe acting is another audible element that adds to the overall authenticity of the movie. Corio is a star in the making and has a natural screen presence. Mescal (God's Creatures, Normal People) carries much of the film's larger thematic weight, and I kept waiting for some small moment that would provide more meaning behind the surface level. Mescal is very good and his dynamic with his young co-star feels heartwarming and genuine. I enjoyed spending time with both of these actors, and while they charmed me, I kept wishing that they had a little more material to flex.\n\nAftersun is an easy movie to admire and see what Wells was going for, reflecting perhaps some biographical experience and something that every adult can insert themself and think about their own parental relationships, wondering what sort of things they took for granted during those innocent days of childhood and the acknowledgement of the quiet struggles of parents. It's filmed beautifully and acted with sensitivity and plenty of understatement, the kind of thing that indie film fans and critics vaunt as revelatory filmmaking. It's a solid movie that only comes to 90 minutes, but it also felt like I was watching a stranger's home movies without context.\n\nNate's Grade: B",

The film thrives on its subtleties and ambiguities, and I think this may turn away some viewers. However, these are the special elements that give the film its edge - you are not given all the answers, but you are given enough visual storytelling to form your own judgments about an incredibly intimate and organic story of a woman reminiscing about a vacation she took with her father in Turkey when she was a young girl. The moments of tenderness, honesty, and vulnerability between Calum, played with a raw and anguished sensibility by Paul Mescal, and his teenage daughter Sophie (a very natural, curious, and wise performance by Frankie Corio) make this a true touching charmer. \nShot to look much like a shaky home video with hints of French New Wave influences, the scenes unfold quite seamlessly to make the viewers join adult Sophie in her journey of watching old video footage to deconstruct the memories of that shared experience she had with her dad. It's not so much about what Sophie discovers upon revisiting these evocations, but about what we, as the viewer, can infer or conclude based on these recollections. And these are largely based on dissections of quiet, symbolic moments interspersed throughout. Both beautiful and haunting.",

I really enjoyed the character interactions and the conversations our leads have, and there's a lot of subtle underplay going on, especially with Sophie's burgeoning journey towards adulthood. But the film never had a real emotional punch. From what I've heard, it's a somewhat autobiographical film, and just like Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's Roma, I don't think this works in the films favour. By making a film so personal and so close to your own heart, you potentially alienate anyone who hasn't been through what your film is dealing with. Because of this, I appreciated what the movie was saying, but it never truly spoke to me. I very much look forward to Well's future career, as she's demonstrated here that she has what it takes to make a movie and make it well. But Aftersun, for one reason or another, didn't quiet hit me like it had it had so many others.",

As a cinephile, I have no objection to slow pacing, cryptic story-telling or sparse use of dialogue. But there has to be a semblance of a plot, an inciting incident, some identifiable character arc. You have to give the audience something to work with. This movie fails on all those fronts.\nThere were also aspects that, in my view, showed a lack of respect to the viewer. In one scene, we are given a brief shot of Paul Mescal's character practising Tai Chi, making it very clear to us that he's into meditation. Then, a few scenes later, we are treated to an extended shot of a prominent pile of books entitled \"Tai Chi\" and \"How To Meditate\". Why beat the audience over the head in this fashion? That summed up the movie for me: on-the-nose when it didn't need to be, excessively vague in its storyline, and rather self-important.",

The effect is to get you inside the heads of the two protagonists and witness their relationship in all its beauty and pain. It may have been a little slow at the beginning, and although he more than makes up for it with a towering performance, Paul Mescal looks a little fresh to be a stressed 30 year old.

            "content": "Paul Mescal and newcomer Frankie Corio star in Charlotte Wells' triumphant feature debut \"Aftersun\".  The film brings an intimate portrayal of a father's relationship with his daughter to the screen, whilst also capturing a holiday experience that British viewers will be all too familiar with. Wells draw on her own experiences for the film, with her own feelings and memories blending with fiction to create gut-wrenching emotion and a poignant story.\n\nThe film, set in the late 1990s, follows 11-year-old Sophie (Frankie Corio) and her father Calum (Paul Mescal) as they go on vacation together in Turkey. Sophie views the world differently to her father, being on the cusp of adolescence with her biggest worry being going back to school and doing her homework, while Calum sees the world under the weight of his declining mental health and responsibilities of being a father. Years later, Sophie is now an adult herself, and reminisces on the vacation she took with her father through both real and imagined memories, as well as rewatching DVR footage of their time abroad. With Calum seemingly no longer involved in Sophie's life, she reflects on the relationship she had with her father, seeing him in a new light with the knowledge and intelligence she now has as an adult. \n\nPaul Mescal delivers a spectacular performance as Calum, the Irishman acts with evocation and emotion, crafting a performance that is easily one of 2022's best, and very worthy of an Oscar nomination. Mescal and his 12-year-old co-star Frankie Corio, brilliantly bounce off each other's performances, creating an on-screen bond that feels incredibly real and intimate. They radiate youth and authenticity, with both performers working together to balance the powerful emotion with enjoyable humour. Corio, who makes her acting debut in the film, holds her own against her BAFTA-winning co-star, delivering an outstanding performance that effortlessly draws you into every scene. \n\nCinematographer George Oke, known for his work on short films like \"Alice\" and \"In a Room Below,\" works with Wells to craft delectable visuals for the film, with Oke's work skilfully exploring the film's themes, observing them through a warm-toned colour palette. As well as directing, Wells pens the screenplay for the film, producing a well-paced and empathetic screenplay that beautifully elevates both the film itself, as well as the performances. \"Aftersun\" covers a myriad of themes during its 102-minute runtime, from childhood and parenthood to memory and mental health, while also depicting a difficult relationship between a father and his daughter. The result of the film's sprawling themes coming together in harmony is a powerful drama that feels incredibly simple, while also being deeply complex, and packing an emotional punch for viewers. \n\n\"Aftersun\" is a sensational directorial debut from Charlotte Wells. Lead by knockout performances from Paul Mescal and Frankie Corio, the film is a profound drama that paints an intimate portrait of a father daughter relationship that tugs on your heartstrings. The film is accompanied by a wonderful score by Oliver Coates (\"Significant Other\"), that is full of melodic tones that work in harmony with each other. \"Aftersun\" forces its audiences to deal with feelings of love and loss, as well as a plethora of themes that will tug on your heartstrings and leave you teary-eyed by the time the credits roll. This is a film that quickly earns it spot among the year's best, from the performances to the technical aspects, everything works hand in hand to create a stellar film.",

Paul Mescal plays Calum, a young father on vacation in Turkey with his adolescent daughter, Frankie Corio's Sophie and the film is framed through an adult Sophie revisiting those holiday videotapes and remembering a father she seems to have lost. Or not. While Mescal's Calum is wonderfully underplayed and Corio's Sophie comes across natural and believable, the deliberate decision to adapt an opaque depiction of Calum leaves me distant and frustrated. So while we sense his inarticulate sadness or anger as we wonder why he has a cast on his arm, or watch him sob uncontrollably, or walk into the ocean at night, we never understand why. The film makes a bunch of implicit suggestions: mental health issues, a bad breakup with Sophie's mom whom he's obviously separated from, or maybe he's struggling with his sexuality (something I thought was hinted at especially in light of who Sophie grew up to be but I could've overthought this one) but refuses to be anything but elliptical. While many have find this withholding and underplaying bold and artistically attractive, it can also come across as a pretentious way to hedge one's bet. Granted, this is a personal and atmospheric film where the visuals (and the variations on certain needle-drop moments) demonstrate incredible confidence and flair that's most promising for a young director, but I cannot shake the feeling that this is a short film stretched into feature length and its very Claire Denis-ness, its abstractness and artistic pacing, what many reviewers like about this film, are exactly the things I find I don't have the patience for.",

I am well aware of just how lucky I've been to not have to hang on to memories and old videos of people who mean so much to me.\n\nHowever, Aftersun made me feel so much despite my experiences or lack thereof. The ability to put the audience in the shoes of a character fully should never be underestimated. This is a film that is not only deeply touching but so smart in the way it goes about telling its intimate story. Some people, like director Charlotte Wells, are so inherently talented that when they can put even a little of that talent on display it's a wonder to witness. Every shot feels personal, whether she went through this experience herself or not, her directing complements her writing so beautifully. The story reveals itself bit by bit. The heartache only grows stronger as the runtime goes on. And the ending in particular is so powerful that it's kinda mind-blowing to realize just how much is achieved in such a low-budget film. Perhaps the fact that the movie feels grander than it actually speaks to just how similar human beings are to one another. The fact is that no matter where we're from or what we've gone through personally at some level deep down we can all relate somehow. There's just something so utterly heartbreaking when you realize that the more attached you're growing to these characters the more everything hurts.\n\nI can't imagine a better film than this will come out for the remainder of 2022, but who knows really. Another thing to mention is that Aftersun will likely grow on me even more on subsequent watches, which I am so looking forward to. Nearly perfect piece of art.",

I mean nothing.  The movie is an hour and 42 minutes.  I left at an hour and a half, and at that point, we'd had one, 30 second scene of the adult daughter's life.  The rest of it was her and her Dad on vacation..swimming, going to dinner, shooting pool, playing video games.  You get the idea.  This was supposed to be about an adult daughter reconciling the father she knew with the man he was- whatever that entailed.  No joke: After 90 minutes, we had no insight beyond the vacation they had taken when she was 11.  This is the first film I've ever left before it was over.  And I should have left much sooner.",

There was SO much to love about this movie, especially the two protagonists (so beautifully portrayed by Paul Mescal and Frankie Corio) and their loving yet imperfect relationship with one another. After 90 minutes of spending time with them and \"living\" in their experiences in an intimate way, I was very emotionally invested in this father and child. Yet, although hints of an anguished story relentlessly thrummed in the background, the story remained a tightly guarded secret. Reviewers have lauded this, but I felt dropped like a hot potato. Not that I needed back story, a narrative, or a neatly spelled-out denouement. But the repeated, entirely enigmatic \"dream\" sequences (if that's even what they were) and the \"it's-anyone's-guess\" ending left me feeling cheated and wondering why the writer and filmmaker chose to do this.",

I felt the movie might have worked better as a short film, or could have benefitted from exploring the older version of the character more. Despite its pacing, I found myself moved by this little story and think the small tender moments that are presented do say a lot and could spark discussions if the film was analyzed on a technical level.",
