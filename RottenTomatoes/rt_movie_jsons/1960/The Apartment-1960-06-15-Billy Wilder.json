            "content": "Wilder was an absolute genius. Diamond too. The Apartment is a moral tale for all time. Like Chaucer, Wilder and Diamond have us laughing and crying but most importantly, thinking. The largest question is, would CC Baxter have reformed if he hadn't fallen in love with Fran Kubalik? Or, would he just have carried on as one of the morally bankrupt higher ups he aspired to? There's a thin line between comedy and tragedy here. Of all Wilder's films, this one stays with me the longest.The whole cast is a master class in acting. Catharsis is liberating. This film runs the emotional gamut from A to Z. Can't say that about too many movies.",

Events occur that bring them into close proximity to where she realizes that he is a nice loving guy and that she wants to be with him... There are some nice touches. Lemmon's character has a couple characteristics to make him a bit more likable and the moments in which they are getting to know one another are quite good, but in the end this film just doesn't do enough, doesn't say anything deeply profound.

            "content": "The Apartment is astounding because it makes me consider how we view actors based on where we arrive in reality. For me, Fred McMurray is the kind Steve Douglas from TV's My Three Sons. For those born before 1960, they probably saw him on that show and wondered how the heel from Double Indemnity and The Caine Mutiny could be trusted around three growing children.\n\nIn Billy Wilder's The Apartment, he's Jeff Sheldrake, a man who uses everyone he meets, like lonely C.C. \"Bud\" Baxter (Jack Lemmon) for his apartment and Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) for her body, uncaring when he pushes both of their to the pit of depression and even a suicide attempt by Fran.\n\nBud is willing to let the rest of the world see him as the villain, as every executive \u2014 Ray Walston is one of them  \u2014 uses his home to have dalliances with his secret lovers while he drinks in bars, dreaming of taking home a married woman when all he really wants is the kind of secure love that allows you to sit happily on the couch next to one another and play cards.\n\nThere's also a genuine sadness at the heart of this movie, as Wilder and co-writer I.A.L. Diamond based the film on reality, as high-powered agent Jennings Lang was shot by producer Walter Wanger for having an affair with Wanger's wife Joan Bennett. Lang had used a low-level employee's apartment for the affair, just like the film. Diamond also contributed something that had happened to a friend, who returned home after breaking up with his girlfriend to discover that she had committed suicide in his bed.\n\nBack to McMurray. After this was released, women yelled at him in the street, complaining that he had made a filthy movie. One even hit him with her purse. I guess that was the Twitter of 1960.\n\nThis may be the best awarded movie we've talked about on this site, as it won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction and Best Film Editing at the 1960 Oscars. Jack Lemmon may not have won Best Actor, but when Kevin Spacey won that award in 1999 for American Beauty, he dedicated his Oscar to him, as Sam Mendes had the cast watch this movie for inspiration.\n\nSince then, The Apartment has been remade as a musical (Promises, Promises, which played in 1972 and was revived in 2010) and as two Bollywood movies, Raaste Kaa Patthar and Life in a\u2026 Metro.\n\nThe amazing thing is that 62 years after this movie was made, it reduced me to tears. It pulled me in and made me care about every single character, even the villain, and the closing scene \u2014 and that last line! \u2014 absolutely devastated me.\n\nYou can get The Apartment from Kino Lorber either on blu ray or 4K UHD. You'll also get two different audio commentary tracks, one by Joseph McBride, author of Billy Wilder: Dancing on the Edge and the other by film historian Bruce Block. There's also a documentary about the making of the film and another about the art of Jack Lemmon, plus a trailer.",

A Rom-Com yes, but without question the film is about loneliness. Shirley McLaine gives a delightfully touching performance as Jack Lemmon adds a comedic and subtle touch to his character. Both play likeable albeit na\u00efve, lonely characters getting manipulated by the same person. Suffice to say they're both complex characters. \n\nIn essence it is a Rom-Com but with a typically Wilder-esque cynical and dark twinge to it.\n\nA must watch. If you're not a Rom-Com fan don't be put off by this. This is one of the most original Rom-Coms (admittedly a dark and cynical one) you're ever likely to see and is a must watch and much like with Some Like It Hot a fabulous last line.",

            "content": "A truly sexist disappointment.\n\nBilly Wilder's romantic comedy-drama The Apartment (1960) is not the hailed comedy critics and audiences would have had me believe. This film is so disappointing to me. It's not funny, so it fails as a comedy for me. The drama is so melodramatic and it's not romantic as the leads are barely together. Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon are the only parts that work for me. Fred MacMurray is just so slimy and unfunny to watch doing what might as well be an impression of Burt Lancaster in Sweet Smell of Success (1957). MacLaine's Fran feels like a modern woman stuck in a male dominated corporate, toxic work environment. However, Billy Wilder does little to make her character feel empowered as I never believed she'd stick with MacMurray's cheating boss for so long after endless betrayals. I know in real life some women ride or die for cheaters, but it doesn't make for a fun romantic comedy. The Apartment is a depressing drama through and through.\n\nI found it tasteless and old-fashioned, clearly written by two men with no genuine compassion or empathy for how women feel, think, or act. Writers Billy Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond leans so heavily into portraying every businessman as a sleazy, sexist, womanizing cheater that I'm not having fun watching men belittle women. I'm dumbfounded how so many women viewers adore The Apartment. I found it condescending, sexist, and unpleasant. I was in a great mood going into The Apartment, but now I just feel down.\n\nI recently watched Billy Wilder's 1955 comedy The Seven Year Itch, which also delighted others, but I found it to be dated, sexist, and unfunny in all the wrong ways. Much to my absolute horror and profound disappointment, The Apartment is just as sexist and also about the exact same topic of cheating men. Wilder's direction is slow and the entire movie barely got a smile out of me. \n\nIt's one thing to make a comedy making fun of businessmen cheating on their wives, but The Apartment tries so hard to sympathize with the cheaters and makes the women all look like saps who desperately cling to these scumbags. I honestly loathe films like this and I've enjoyed Billy Wilder's comedy Some Like It Hot, but The Apartment fell flat for me. I'll stick with his impeccable dramas like Witness for the Prosecution, Sunset Boulevard, or Double Indemnity. Even those serious pictures have more humor in them than The Apartment.\n\nEditor Daniel Mandell could have cut this dragging 125 minutes down to 80 for such a thin narrative. Who cares if Joseph LaShelle's cinematography is pretty or if Adolph Deutsch's score is lovely, if the romantic comedy aspect doesn't work for me at all? \n\nI liked Jack Lemmon fumbling his way into romance, but he's supposed to be this nice guy who helps the sweet and innocent Shirley MacLaine, but he's also helping these men to cheat to climb the corporate ladder, so I have little to no sympathy for Lemmon's C.C. \u2018Bud' Baxter either.\n\nShirley MacLaine is the sole light of The Apartment with a forward feeling performance that lends the audience to empathize with a woman dating a married man whom she still loves. But I just don't find that women should keep seeing a married man once she knows he's married and is the type of sleaze who will never leave. It makes MacLaine's progressive woman feel dumb and naive.\n\nIn all, I'm just sad that I didn't find The Apartment to be a funny comedy that holds up. It's not very romantic and the drama just feels sour with its very male centric perspective and I'm a man sick of these infidelity stories. So glad I didn't watch this one on a date!",

With every performance the guy gives, in everything I've ever seen him in, he builds an express lane straight to your heart, immediately endearing himself to you and making you laugh. Shirley MacLaine is equally winsome, with the chemistry between her and Lemmon really comprising most of the film's appeal. What's most surprising about the film is its deft ability to juggle totally disparate tonalities. It's definitely a comedy in that it's \"comedic\" (in the Greek sense of the word), but \"The Apartment\" also takes great risks in its second and third acts, introducing certain thematic elements I didn't expect, but ultimately welcomed with open arms. It's brave, arresting and terrific in its execution. Again, I'm not at all shocked this won as many Oscars as it did.",

It's a darkly comic satire of the professional office life and the pitfalls of climbing the corporate ladder. Jack Lemmon gives an astonishing lead performance, full of both energy and gravitas. He's a fundamentally good person with the deep flaw of allowing others to take advantage of him, and constantly puts himself in the position of taking undue blame. We all either know this kind of person, or we are that kind of person. It's a difficult habit to kick, and Lemmon's slow rise from under the boot is a joy to behold. Shirley MacLaine deserves a lot of credit too for her often understated but always powerful performance. The romantic chemistry between them never feels forced, and their equally awkward personalities conflict perfectly. The second half of the film isn't quite as enjoyable as the first, largely because of the shift from comedy to drama, but it's necessary to the story and the film wouldn't be the same without it. Its content might be tame by today's standards, but its heart and soul is undiminished by time. In the Academy's Best Picture catalogue, it might not be the most profound of films, but it's definitely one of the most charming.",

I think what made this movie worthwhile for me was the ending. I think it is one of those movies that has a truly satisfying ending but the journey there can be hit or miss.

Shot in lovely black and white, its high camp would often preclude emotional depth, but the comedy only opens the viewer up to the feelings that underlie the practice of scheduling affairs that are the centerpiece of the action of The Apartment. A marriage where the heart is trapped inside the white picket fence. The perfect picture can reveal an portrait of Dorian Grey where the man looks perfect on the outside but the inside is a lonely place. Jack Lemmon's character loans out his apartment key to senior co-workers to try to climb the executive branch, deepening his own sense of isolation. The men are cads, the women are objects, and nobody is getting the love they really need. The hook up culture was more transactional than now, but no less soulless. Wilder offers us no detailed solutions for the dilemmas of the American family but takes a stand for hope, for love, for integrity, for humanness.",

Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is an accountant in New York who lets his chief co-workers use his apartment for marital affairs. At work, he hitches with an elevator operator Fran (Shirley MacLaine), who's secretly having an affair with his boss Mr. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray). Part of what makes this a classic is the charm, which emerges from Lemmon's politeness and MacLaine's direct attitude. On top of that, the scenes where the two mistake something mundane for a suicide are absolutely hilarious. Part of the jokes stem from Fran's sleeping pill overdose, her past relationships, C.C.'s past suicide attempt, and some allusions to The Lost Weekend (see said movie on this list for more info). My favorite misunderstanding is the scene where Fran hears a bang from his apartment and she cries and hollers his name. After, C.C opens the door with an open champagne bottle and discovers her standing by the door. Again, the joke works because of the build-up involving him buying a gun, quitting his job, and finding out that Sheldrake will hope to marry Fran. So, I really enjoyed this film, comedy-wise, plot-wise, Oscar-wise and otherwise-wise.\n\n(4 Spaghettis on Tennis Rackets out of 5)",

            "content": "Billy Wilder's The Apartment is usually described as a romantic comedy. That's mostly a fair description, but it's rather more than that: it also handles some surprisingly dark themes in a sensitive manner, and in doing so blends comedy, drama and poignancy with great skill.\nReleased in 1960, The Apartment raised eyebrows in some quarters for the fact that it is a comedy about adultery, a subject that director and writer Wilder wanted to tackle years earlier but wasn't able to thanks to the Code. The story thus concerns C. C. \"Bud\" Baxter, a lowly office worker who allows four of his bosses to use his apartment for their extra-marital affairs. Initially, we see him frantically trying to juggle the conflicting demands of these four, whilst he neighbour Dr Dreyfuss assumes him to be some kind of sexual superman due to the sounds he hears through the wall. However, things become more complicated when big boss Sheldrake decides to take advantage of the situation, but uses Baxter's apartment for liaisons with the girl Baxter is falling in love with.\nVery often, this is played for the laughs that one expects and it works very well. Jack Lemmon is perfectly good as Baxter, displaying his usual likeability, comic timing and gift for physical comedy. He gets some lovely scenes, whether he's distributing nasal spray everywhere due to his cold, dancing glumly cheek-to-cheek with Mrs MacDougall, or cheerfully straining spaghetti through a tennis racket. Lemmon is a very physical actor and conveys Baxter's constant air of hangdog twitchiness at the complexity of his life wonderfully. Wilder's screenplay \u2013 co-written with I. A. L. Diamond \u2013 also boasts some very funny dialogue, such as when Baxter is phoning the four men he lets use his apartment, and when he tells Mrs MacDougall \"We might as well go to mine \u2013 everyone else does!\"\nThe surprise here however is in how Baxter's intended sweetheart Fran Kubelik is written. She gives a heartfelt, tearful speech about what it feels like to kid herself that the man she is meeting is unmarried, and eventually she tries to commit suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills. Wilder handles these moments of real emotion convincingly, without compromising the film's funnier moments by switching to melodrama. It's an impressive balancing act and he pulls it off, partly due to his writing and direction and partly due to vulnerable, realistic performance of Shirley MacLaine in the role. But whilst Fran's plight is sensitively handled, the film never becomes mawkish and ultimately ends with a charming denouement that sees Baxter and Fran resuming their game of gin-rummy after he tells her how he feels about her.\nThe rest of the cast is just as well chosen as Lemmon and MacLaine, with Fred MacMurray \u2013 who previously starred in Wilder's Double Indemnity \u2013 demonstrating a knack for deadpan comedy as Sheldrake and wonderful turns from actors in minor roles, most notably Hope Holiday as Mrs MacDougall and Naomi Stevens as the formidable Mrs Dreyfus. Wilder's tendency for solid, non-flashy direction allows the performances of his actors to be the audience's focus, and he's aided by great set design (the forced perspective office set is most impressive \u2013 if you haven't read about it, you probably won't notice it), including the decision to make the apartment set slightly shabby, which ends up giving it a nicely lived-in appearance. He also includes an amusing in-joke as Dobisch likens the girl he's hoping to spend forty-five minutes at the apartment with to Marilyn Monroe, Lemmon's co-star in Wilder's previous film Some Like it Hot. \nWilder made many great films, amongst them a handful of comedies: The Apartment isn't his funniest, but it is one of his most subtle. It is little surprise that it won the Academy Award for Best Picture, even if its subject matter outraged prudish conservative audience members at the time.",

The script kept the film moving nicely and felt very natural. The supporting cast was very good as well as we are in the insurance company. Lemmons character Baxter is striving for promotion and finds a way this could happen. Allowing important people to use his apartment as they have affairs could help him career. We shouldn't really like him for doing this, but i think he is a bit naive and ultimately finds it hard to say no. He is a very likeable character as we see this in his actions in his apartment as he tries to cook, and support Fran.  Seeing Fran at her lowest as she attempts suicide is very sad as we believe she is a good person who falls in love with the wrong men, but also how manipulative men who have importance in a business can be. Baxters support for her is very sweet as he helps her. The neighbours are extremely funny. From the doctor and his wife who assume Baxter is a womanizer and part animal. They are the light relief from the drama at times. They both play this very well. We want the two leads to get together as they feel like two oddballs. Many scenes with the two leads together keeps our interest from the card game, the pasta using a tennis racket and many interactions as they meet on the elevator. Maybe Baxter is going up in the world but actually he is going down in his own estimation of himself. Watching him eventually reject his bosses plea for his apartment is the first sign that he wants to change. Its a new year and it will be a new Baxter. Frans realisation as well that she can never be happy with her current situation means she needs to change as well. Whether Fran and Baxter ever get together isn't important. They have learnt they want more. An excellent script with two likeable and honest performances from the two leads kept my interest and in the end i was happy with how the film ended.",

It will be the last black & white film to win the Best Picture award until 1994's Schindler's List.\n\nThe movie starts off with what seems to be a rather silly premise. Office worker CC Baxter (Jack Lemmon) loans out his apartment to superiors in his firm, so they can have a place to carry on their extra-marital affairs, in the hopes it will advance his own career.\n\nBut it's not long before the frivolity of this gag takes a twist and this film, considered a comedy, soon begins to deal with some heavy subject matter, as two protagonists begin to think the worst of themselves. But thanks to the brilliant performances by Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, the darkness never gets a real foothold. It was also nice to see Fred MacMurray playing against his affable archetype. He's the son-of-a-bitch boss who's going to get his way\u2026 until he doesn't. As with many Wilder films, the movie quickly wraps up right at the point where you wish it would pick up again and carry on!\n\n\"Shut up and deal!\"",

            "content": "This may be one of the most depressing comedies I have ever seen which only made it's sweet, romantic ending all the more satisfying. I have come to love Billy Wilder as I watch every Best Picture winner ever as both this and the superb The Lost Weekend (1945) are some of the best films to be selected by the Academy, who usually have questionable judgment, as the best film to be released in a year. This film also boasts the nonpareils Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon giving some of their most famous performances and Fred MacMurray, better known as the father on My Three Sons, as a surprisingly despicable villain. I lapped up every moment of this film as I was drawn into conflicts and tensions that I would never have found engaging if a lesser creative force was bringing them to the screen.\n\nThe unassuming C.C. Baxter, Jack Lemmon, tends to his superiors every need as he allows them to use his apartment to have affairs in exchange for his receiving a promotion at work. He falls for the lovely Frank Kubelik, Shirley MacLaine, but she, emotionally vulnerable, agrees to go back to her married ex-boyfriend Mr. Sheldrake, Fred MacMurray, who uses Baxter's apartment for his affair with her. When Kubelik makes a suicide attempt while in Baxter's apartment he falls completely in love with her and realizes he must defy his bosses if he is to escape the loneliness that has haunted his life for many years.\n\nWhen watching the film you find it shocking that such disgusting material could be discussed in such a frank and blas\u00e9 fashion. The idea that all of this, men regularly having affairs with female employees, is just the way it is seems shocking but you quickly realize that the film shares the audiences' disgust for the actions of these men. Early on we get a scene of Kubelik rebuffing the sexual advances of a man as he openly slaps her on the bottom at work as she is a symbol of female strength but later we realize how vulnerable she is to the advances of predatory men. It is clear that Sheldrake is a father figure of sorts and Kubelik later relates to Baxter that she always picks the wrong men, one of her ex-boyfriends will be in prison for the next five years, but MacLaine does have a strength behind her despite all of the stupid decisions her character makes and that allows us to root for her.\n\nThe main character is also really a despicable man if we looked at the story through a different lens, say that of his neighbors, but Lemmon is so endearing as the man who infuriatingly refuses to take action. My fears for him as he gives in constantly to insistent bosses who are clearly using him, even he appears to be aware, were huge as I didn't want this kind, well meaning man to miss out on a genuinely great girl due to lack of confidence. Sad, lonely men aren't uncommon in cinema but rarely are they as well drawn as they are here as we learn interesting little facts about him like the fact that he strains noodles through a tennis racket and come to see why a fantastic woman like Kubelik could come to truly love him.\n\nThe look and feel of the film was also just wonderful as the full power of black and white cinematography is on display here. Everything seems to have texture and depth even as static shots are taken and even shots of New York skyscrapers seem unique through Wilder's lens. Wilder's direction is brilliant as he balances the funny and the extremely sad and proves he is a master of cynicism as even despite the happy ending we know that the apartment users will find another Baxter to terrorize.\n\nThis may be one of the greatest films I have ever seen therefore I believe it's Best Picture win is completely justified and when looking at the competition it's easy to see why this was the winner. I think that MacLaine deserved Best Actress, she lost to the deplorable Elizabeth Taylor, and it's a travesty that the modern, mainstream filmgoer isn't watching this film instead of Captain Marvel (2019).",

The Apartment wouldn't have the right to be dubbed a Comedy, if it weren't for Wilder's shrewdly light touch.\n\nWhile I.A.L. Diamond's screenplay (co-written with director Billy Wilder) couldn't have dealt with its extremely heavy underlying themes (infidelity, melancholy, exploitation, oppression, loss of self-respect and indignity, etc.) in a both more subtle and brilliantly sophisticated way, it's Billy Wilder's astute and meticulous direction that made this film a very unique dark comedy that feels as if it was released today.\n\nAny actor could have easily fallen victim to the dark and sad core of the story that deftly prevailed at some point, exactly as C.C. Baxter have been crestfallen when he realized that he lives in an oppressive world where everybody pursues his/her own self-interest. But Jack Lemmon, only through his eyes, injected pathos into the role when the movie took its very dark turn.\n\nI have been always impressed by how Williams captures the heartbreak and emotional devastation in the climactic scenes of her movies. I bet that Michelle Williams has learned that from Shirley MacLaine! For MacLaine here delivered an astonishingly remarkable and complex performance as the likable Fran Kubelik, who has a lot underneath her cheerful demeanor. I won't give any details about her character, but it goes without saying that she is one of the most complex cinematic characters that can give you an impactful insight into depression. it's no surprise that Kubelik has influenced many iconic female movie characters.\n\nA timeless comedy classic like no other, The Apartment is one of the absolute finest Best Picture winners that's pretty much perfect in every respect \u00ef\u00bf 1/2\" directing-wise, script-wise, acting-wise.
