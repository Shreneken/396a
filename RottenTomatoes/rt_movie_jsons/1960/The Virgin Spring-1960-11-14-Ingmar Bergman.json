On their way through the woods, the girls encounter a group of savage goat herders who brutally rape and murder Karin as Ingeri remains hidden. When the killers unwittingly seek refuge in the farmhouse of T\u00f6re and M\u00e4reta, T\u00f6re plots a fitting revenge.",

            "content": "Grim even by Ingmar Bergman's standards, The Virgin Spring is certainly one of his most bleak and disturbing films.  Set in medieval Sweden, a young girl is sexually assaulted and murdered by a trio of goat herders, who later that evening find themselves seeking refuge in the home of the victim's father.  It is a film about rape, murder, guilt, revenge and misguided religious devotion and is unrelenting in its impact.  Bergman's direction, as always, is impeccable, as is Sven Nykvist cinematography.  Filled with powerful images and meaningful symbolism, it is a film of grotesque beauty that is difficult to forget and even more difficult to digest.",

The film begins with some over-the-top smiley acting which I thought would continue throughout the film. However, the plot takes a tragic turn which allows the film to become more engaging as you don't know where the plot is going and what the reactions of the other characters will be. The film's acting is okay and the cinematography isn't good. However, the plot and screenplay helped keep my interest. Although an early film of his, Bergman's direction should be commended as the pace of the film never slows down too much. The film's direction and screenplay is good, however, most other elements of the film are sub-standard. The film won the Best Foreign Language Picture Oscar. I have not seen the other nominees except for Kapo which I did not like and was definitely not as well-made as The Virgin Spring. The film was also nominated for Best Costume Design which I didn't think made the film stand out but did allow me to believe the medieval Swedish world these characters were living in.",

It is built as a theater tragedy, and, as so, it grows up to the to the tragic resolution.\nThe film is not a splatter at all, however the violence here is brutal: both the crime and the revenge. Not a drop of real blood is shown (and also fake blood very scarcely, and only once), nothing to be compared to Tarantino, for example: but, while in a Tarantino the violence is obviously a fake, here it is emotionally real: it strikes you in your guts and your soul.\nHowever, the poetic moments are many: everything is immersed into the magic of the great Nordic forest, and quotations to the religion - both Christian and pagan - are many: notable the representation of the last supper, repeated twice, and, in the end, what I can only compare to \"La Piet\u00e0\", by Michelangelo: that is what leave the viewer, leaving the cinema, with a beautiful feeling inside.\nThank to my local cine club for finding and showing these milestone of the cinema.",

            "content": "In watching these old Ingmar Bergman movies, the thought occurs to me that Bergman was to cinema what the golden age of Russian literature was to writing.  His films have a certain depth to them, and feel meaty with their observations on human nature and their questions of religion and philosophy.  'The Virgin Spring', based on a 13th century Swedish ballad, is no exception.  \n\nIf you think about it, the story of 'The Virgin Spring' encapsulates quite a bit of the effect of religion on those who believe, starting with a girl needing to mind her chastity until marriage, and continuing on with a virgin must deliver candles for Matins.   When a horrible thing happens to the girl, her companion and her mother both believe it's because of them, that God had listened to their jealous prayers, while her father is stricken and asks that time-old question, \"God, how could you let this happen?\"  However, none of them challenge that most deeply held assertion, that God exists in the first place.  After exacting brutal vengeance, including killing a child, the grief-ridden father asks God for forgiveness, and promises to build him a church on the site.   He still believes in spite of it all, wants to remain upright in the best way he can conceive, and is both admirable and flawed at the same time.  \n\nIn telling this story with elements of Job (\"Why?\") and Exodus/Leviticus (\"An eye for an eye\"), Bergman examines human nature - the inclination to do evil, and the morality of vengeance - as well as the nature of God, and our relationship to Him.  How you perceive the film's meaning will likely depend on your most personal views, but it will certainly make you think.  \n\nAs for the filmmaking, Bergman keeps his storytelling taut - every scene counts - and he captures plenty of great moments, including some beautiful shots of the outdoors in Sweden, and heavy emotions on the faces of his actors.  One scene in particular made the film controversial, however, and no review would be complete without mentioning it.  The rape is horrific, and seriously disturbing.  We see evil coming as Bergman masterfully builds up tension, but are still shocked - both at the incredible cruelty of the men, but also at Bergman keeping the camera on them as they commit the act (especially for 1960).    He knew he didn't have to show a lot of flesh to show how vile, disgusting, degrading, and animalistic a rape is, and it's a shame the film was banned in some places given the prevalence of rape in society.  The scene speaks to the darkest aspect of man, and yet oozes authenticity.\n\nAs to whether religion casts a darkness of its own on man, the shadow of ignorance, or gives his life meaning and elevates him over nihilism and chaos, the reader will have to decide, but I believe Bergman is in the latter camp with this film.   He is a bit over the top at the end, hitting us over the head with the miracle of the 'virgin spring' that gushes forth, and while that's presumably how the 13th century legend goes, it's the reason I knocked my rating down a bit for what is still a very good film.",

Is he a hypocrite for espousing religious rhetoric and succumbing to the passions innate to human nature? Why would a god do this to a religious family at all?\n\nThose who practice religion are portrayed as cruel and judgmental, focusing on building huge, indulgent churches while the average man lives in huts. This is not an indictment of religion, however; the fact that the finale suggests rebirth through the divine and offers an explanation for why man would feel the need to honor their deity through massive monuments rebukes that interpretation entirely. Bergman simply questions the nature of man's relationship to god, whether or not man is futile in shouting up at a man in the sky they've never seen. He offers no answers because there aren't any, the conundrum unsolvable, ambiguous beyond explanation, a decision that rings true to life.",

Although the story plays straightforwardly, greater enjoyment comes through pondering the meanings behind Bergman's symbolic tapestry. The master guides us through this heartbreaking tale with a delicate hand and a gorgeous, poetic touch. It's actually one of his simplest and most moving works -- a film to be savored and pondered. Sven Nykvist's luminous black-and-white photography conspiring with the austerity of Bergman's imagery to create an extraordinary metaphysical charge. Easily lost amid a brilliant career, The Virgin Spring once again shows Bergman's control in capturing the furthest ranges of emotion. Bergman's instinctive approach to filmmaking - like his gripping use of long wordless moments filled with pictures of great power- is in evidence, with some unforgettable scenes that even today, almost 50 years later, have fresh impact. The period details are magnificently worked into the narrative, and the pace and economy of the tortured Swede's storytelling make his metaphysics infinitely easier to take.\n\nVERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent... (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",

Mareta represents the goodness of the faithful, while Tore is God who smites evil.\n\nI love the camera-work and lighting used, the long shot of characters were able to reflect the emotions of each character while close ups brought the tension and suspense into full effect. I love the light cast on the character's faces showing the contrast of light and darkness, reflecting the moral dilemma the characters faced.\n\nThe acting was also excellent, from beginning to the end, there was not a single dull moment, everything was meaningful and the symbolism used was able to fully convey the ideas behind the film.

The setting (Middle Ages) and the striking black and white cinematography (courtesy of Sven Nykvist) serve to heighten this effect. But it is the sudden brutal and realistic violence, which is that much more confronting due to its matter-of-factness, that truly commands your gaze and asks you to contemplate the presence and nature of evil.  Max von Sydow's response may be our first primal stab (ultimately toothless) at this foe and Bergman does not shy away at concentrating our attention on its complications.  As in the Book of Job, we and the characters in this medieval drama are led to question why any God would allow evil to exist (even as the competing Pagan spirits are still being worshipped for their power to influence and harm others). There is no simple answer but at least in this film Bergman seems to be suggesting (through symbols and story) that faith is the way ahead.  His next films offer much more doubt.",

            "content": "Teaming up director Ingmar Bergman with legendary actor Max Von Sydow, The Virgin Spring sounded like a collaboration of versatile talent.\n\nThe Virgin Spring is an example of a dated film. While it is a good piece, the effect of its story would not have the same effect today because in a society which reports the violent nature of rape cases left right and centre as well as depicting the dark nature of them in films, the central moment that depicts that in The Virgin Spring does not have the same dramatic impact anymore. It's understandable as the film is 54 years old, and it is enjoyable for its merits as a classic film of Swedish cinema. But there is no denying that it is a dated film, so by contemporary standards it is likely to be judged as one. \nThis is one of the two central scenes in The Virgin Suicides: the rape scene and the brutal moment of vengeance in the final scene. The one scene that would have more of an impact today would be the latter because there is a lot of complex depth in it stemming from how the viewers' morals affect their interpretation of the scene. The impact of the actual moment is not all that powerful because, again, the film is dated. But the meaning of it remains valid. It is dramatic and is depicted very powerfully with raw violence based on clever visual traits, and it does not use complex film techniques to dramatize it. The Virgin Spring feels like a very natural film in terms of the way that Ingmar Bergman handles the drama in the story. Some may find it empty, but I found it to be mostly an atmospheric experience. There are a few scenes where a musical score echoes its way into the film gently and presents a sense of mysterious melancholy on a subtle level which means that it is a nice touch, but overall the film mainly relies simply on the natural atmosphere to build which echoes a certain sense of emptiness into the film. The musical score manages to achieve that same feeling, so it Is a nice addition to the film.\nLike I said, The Virgin Spring is a dated film. It is based on a famous Swedish ballad and is extended to feature length running time yet cannot transcend the fact that it has a limited story. It manages to capitalise on the complex themes and concepts that come with it which are handled powerfully by director Ingmar Bergman. Some may find that the slow pace of the film allows things to happen rather organically and that the classical film style is one of its major benefits, the same way that others may deem it to be an overly simplistic and slow film which did not survive the battle of age. My feelings lie in the middle because while I found the premise to be thin and the development to be slow, the nature of its story was good and the drama was handled well by Ingmar Bergman even if what he was working with seemed like it was stretched for a bit much.\nOne of the key themes in The Virgin Spring seems to be that either directly or indirectly, humans are inherently evil. The one character in the film who is essentially all good is Karin, and that becomes her downfall because her decision to always be a good girl ends up resulting in her untimely suffering and the unfolding of a more dark society around her. It reveals how even the slightest ray of light in life can turn the world into a darker place than before, and the pure darkness in that concept is one of the reasons that The Virgin Spring is a memorable film. It has no optimism but never ends up in melodramatic territory, and the way that it balances the hardcore nature of its drama is fairly impressive.\nThe atmosphere in The Virgin Spring is great. Although the story itself is a simple one, the atmosphere of the film is dramatic but also natural and makes the experience unpredictable. It gives audience the perspective of the character Karin who is innocent and is just coming to terms with the nature of the world. The world seems like a strange and somewhat dark place when the film starts, and it stays on the tone as the film progresses until it makes a sudden turnaround. The drama of the film is terrific.\nVisually, The Virgin Spring is also very nice because the lovely scenery of the film is captured with a lot of nostalgic cinematography while the art direction of the film echoes the time of the setting very well. It is easy to believe the story in The Virgin Spring because it is both firmly dramatic and visually realistic.\nThe performances of the cast in The Virgin Spring are also pretty firm. They aren't all that groundbreaking, but they make the film seem more realistic and therefore more dramatically effective. This is particularly present in Max Von Sydow who is able to make a complex and yet sympathetive figure out of his character as usual which means that viewers are able to see nearly eye to eye with him. He handles the raw drama of the film with a powerful display of human emotion, and you could expect nothing less from him. Max Von Sydow delivers a powerful performance in The Virgin Spring which proves to be essentially no challenge to him, and he delivers the language of the script so naturally that the realistic nature of the story is bound to make an impact in one way or another.\n\nSo although The Virgin Spring is a dated film with a lesser impact by today's standards, the complex nature of the atmosphere, the handling of the material by director Ingmar Bergman, the visual style of the film and the performance of Max Von Sydow manage to make up for it.",

Is revenge ethically, morally, or religiously justifiable?  If God exists, why do bad things happen to good people?  Should we or can we celebrate a deity in a world this fucked up?

A legacy that has been handed over from one generation of film-makers to another and there are countless \"good\" examples of that...\n\nRecently while reading an article related to renowned Director Ang Lee's upcoming epic \"Life of Pi\", Ang Lee in his interview mentioned Ingmar Bergman's Virgin Spring and how it had changed his opinion about cinema when he was just 18. It was also his first R film and he briefly explained how it had a huge impact on his life and how the subtly horrifying images of Virgin Spring totally stunned him. I was very intrigued. I have to check this film out, I told myself. I haven't seen many films of Bergman. My first was The Seventh Seal which I barely remember now and my second was Persona which I watched recently. So I decided to give Virgin Spring a higher priority and today I finally watched it.\n\nBeautiful. Flawless. Thought-provoking. Haunting. Masterpiece. I was left spellbound by the film but at the same time a little surprised at how underrated it is. Sure, I haven't watched Bergman's most well-known works yet so I won't say it's his best. But it surely and easily is one of his best! The Virgin Spring is haunting revenge story that not only questions our faith on God but also gives us hope. While experiencing this film, I felt a little like I was watching Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon again. Ingmar Bergman's direction is superb and, my God, the camera work, the acting everything is perfect.\n\nHighly Recommended. A clean 5/5.",

It aspires to be a spiritual journey into the deepest parts of our minds, as it makes the audience question the actions shown in the movie, but it doesn't give any answers itself. This spellbinding creation touches many important and controversial topics, such as selfishness, vengeance, superfluous brutality, sexual assault, and many notions connected with various religion (Paganism, Norse Mythology etc.). It's a deeply disquieting film, which tells a story about a unimaginably beautiful girl, who one day embarks on a journey to the church in order to light the Virgin candles. However, she never makes hit, because of two ruthless thugs, who rape and murder her in front of their young brother. And it's only the beginning. The whole shocking event makes way for a disturbing aftermath, as the killers unknowingly take shelter in the girl's parents' house. When the loving father realizes, who his guests really are, he goes berserk and finishes them off ruthlessly one after another. Even though it's human to say that killing is never the answer, some may argue whether his decision to be the judge and the executioner is justifiable or not. Fantastically paced and compellingly narrated, The Virgin Diaries proves to be a moralizing tale of the most brutal, and at the same time, most powerful kind, showing its purifying nature in the highly-aesthetic visuals.",

And sometimes, when there's really no returning, all things must go, even those on the sidelines. It's what Peckinpah did with the great \"Straw Dogs\". \"The Virgin Spring\" offers no answers. Why Bergman's so great, is because his filmography is a like an epic poem it's too painful to read back. So you keep dictating and asking questions to keep going.

In combination with a under abundance of cuts, viewers are forced to sit and stare without the influence of music. These are real moments. No music would be playing in real life. Additionally, Bergman's use of lighting and camera angle are superb in these scenes but also throughout. The revenge scene is most notable in both of these techniques, though, because of the fire that is burning in the center of the room. There is a brilliant shot of Herr (Max von Sydow) burning inside about the rape and death of his daughter behind the flames of the fire which acts metaphorically and provides beautiful shadow across his face. Aside from technique, the film;s content is not the deepest that has ever been seen. A daughter is raped, the rapists seek hospitality in the daughter's parents house, and the Herr takes them down. It is a religious household but not even God could save the daughter. Bergman's direction is easily the star of this film.",

Ingmar Bergman seemed to do very well showing how powerful religion was for people cut off from much of the world.  Max von Sydow was cast very well as the father and Birgitta Pettersson played a beautiful Karin showing how naive a young virginal sheltered girl may have acted back in the 14th century.  There is always a mistrust of people in modern times that I don't think many had back then, especially in more quiet areas, so it's easy to see why she would not suspect something was amiss....until she sees for herself, but by then, it's too late.\nWas this film disturbing?  I imagine for 1960, it could have been.

            "content": "In one of his most widely known and controversial films, Ingmar Bergman raises many deep seeded questions. The Virgin Spring offers intelligent insight into justice, vengeance, Gods role in the universe, and so many other areas of faith. Like so much of Bergman's work, this is his personal thoughts and questions displayed on film with luscious cinematography and performers who embody his rich concepts. The ideas and suggestions are strong, just as they are in The Seventh Seal. God, religion, and our bare human behaviors are core areas covered in such films. This was Bergman's first Academy Award winner for Best Foreign Language Film for 1960 and it stands out in an already superb library of fascinating films by the Swedish master director.\r\n\r\nMax Von Sydow and Birgitta Valberg are loving, proud parents who dote on their young daughter (played by Birgitta Pattersson). The Christian family is a happy one and when young Karin (Pattersson) sleeps through church service, she is then tasked to take candles to the church for her mother as a light penance. Along the way, the naive girl is savagely attacked and killed while her servant (Gunnel Lindblom) watches in horror while hiding. The three attackers soon seek shelter at Karin's parents home. During their stay, Karin's cloths are discovered and the servant who witnessed the atrocity confesses what she saw. Now the loving parents are angered to the point of murder...or is it justice? \r\n\r\nBergman is a director who really captures my interest and I want to see as many of his films as I can. This being the 6th one I've seen, I think it might be my overall favorite so far. It is very simple as far as plots are concerned but the way it raises questions is marvelous. Why did a horrible thing happen to a good person? How can a father atone murder? How is the startling and beautiful ending explainable? These are just a few ideas that the story offers us to think about. I admire the risk that this film took and it dares to ask some unsettling questions while offering the freedom to answer and judge for one's self. One of Sydow's most uninhibited scenes is when he crumbles and growls that he does not understand God, yet retains his faith. This moment is then followed by something truly unique and puzzling. The Virgin Spring is a loaded experience and it is as haunting as it is spiritually perceptive. (A)",

Unlike the remakes, this is more of a drama than a horror film, although the events that take place are horrific. The way they are handled is makes it distinct. \n\nThe big push here is this film's focus on themes of religion, forgiveness, faith, heavy questions about the nature of crime and punishment.  In a way, and I'm not trying to  diminish the film here, you could possibly call this (if you had to) an arthouse exploitation film. Because really, it is art, it just happens to be punctuated byt two very strong (but surprisingly tasteful (as it were)) scenes of violence. \n\nI loved this movie because it has Bergman's traemark playing around with light and shadows, and gorgeous cinematography, and the participation of his long time collaborator Max von Sydow (who is excellent). It has wonderful atmosphere, and everything is made more effective and unsettling due to the lack of a soundtrack (most notable during the violence) and the fact that the film doesn't ever go out of its way to see creepy or frightening. Everything is very peaceful, quiet, and serene, and that is far more intense than being overtly gritty. \n\nThe version I watched had an introduction by Ang Lee, and he really does a great job of explaining the film as being so powerful and moving because of the things I've mentioned above, and because the film is an overall classy affair despite the subject matter. Now, I'm giving this the same rating I gave to the first The Last House on the Left, but that doesn't mean the films are equal. In fact, you really can't put them in the same league, despite their similarities. They are both great in their own way. One just happens to be an artsy film with strong symbolism and heavy themes awhile the other is a gritty, disturbing, and unrelenting exploitation thriller (yet still has some subtext).  As a film overall though, I think this one is better, as I see the other working better as more of an experience than as a movie.\n\nYou should definitely give this one a watch, It's some great stuff.",

Along the way, however, the two encounter a trio of travelers, and they trick Karin and then rape and murder her, but Ingeri manages to escape. The killers go to Karin's house for food and shelter soon after, and they try to sell Karin's fancy clothes to M\u00e4reta, and when T\u00f6re finds out, he plans a fitting revenge. \"Jungfruk\u00e4llan\" isn't always considered among Bergman's top five films, however, it is always considered to be one of his most controversial movies, which includes a rape scene (though pretty tame by today's standards), a strange look at religion, revenge, and violence. Unlike many suspense and revenge films, the heart-pounding stuff is never too violent or scary, and just comes to show that even a film as quiet as this can just be as powerful as any thriller. Like director Ang Lee says, his films never entertain, they just make you think. This to me, leaves a mark in Bergman's rep, and I believe that this was the film that I think gave him legendary status. The depth of everything from the characters, the scenery, the music, and the cinematography match the story perfectly, and even if it's not on purpose, it makes the film seem so much more genius and planned out, and make Bergman's style seem ever better. The acting is awesome too, especially from Von Sydow and Lindblom who really step out from what you can call a normal role. \"Jungfruk\u00e4llan\" is an excellently made film that I think is not Bergman's best, but one of his most powerful.",

I tend to shy away from things where the many are saying you have to; read this book/seethis film/watch this director, hence i've never read The Da Vinci Code and i only recently watched Citizen Kane (very good film, well ahead of it's time but not the best film ever made by the way). Eventually i'll come around, like i did with CK and sometimes it is circumstance (although i'll never read the Da Vinci Code based on the couple of paragraphs i read over the shoulder of a train commuter). Such it was, that i can to watch Virgin Spring and i have recorded 2 other highly regarded films, as they have had a Bergman season on Film Four.\r\n\r\nWell this certainly was an auspicious start, although i don't believe that the historic, even farytale setting used by Bergman is his usual style. While what we are actually seeing is a fairytale or folk tale unfold, the themes are modern, Religion, sex and innocence, revenge and redemption. Needless to say i want to see more Bergman films before i get an idea about what he as a director may be saying here, but also that is not necessary becuase the events and symols presented in the film are open to interpretation and arguement, and still are over 50 years after the film was realeased, which is truely the test of how great a film or a director really are surely.\r\n\r\n To that i'd just like to add that the cinematography is beautiful. I've never seen black and white look more alive and I've been a fan of Max Von Sydow for some time but i'm only really familiar with him in his later days in Hollywood fare, This was quite a revelation seeing a vital dominating Sydow in the full vigour of youth and has certainly enhanced my appreciation for him.",

This film, adapted from a medieval ballad, tells of how a fair young maiden was raped and murdered in the forest, and the perpetrators came to spend that very night in the home of her parents. This may sound like the premise for a gory horror film- in fact Wes Craven would later remake this as the shockingly graphic Last House on the Left- but with Bergman there is no question of resorting to shock value, everything is treated with the seriousness and dignity it deserves.\r\n\tThere's little more to the plot than what I've already said. Where this film gets its power is from the depth of the characters and their emotions. Karin, the daughter of a wealthy farmer, is one of the purest, most innocent, and most naive girls I have ever seen. She can be a brat, and is the life of any dance, but could never imagine that anyone would hold impure motives or wish her harm. Even as her killers remark upon her beauty, she cannot fathom that she is in any danger 'til it is far too late.\r\n\tThe family's servant girl, Ingeri, is Karin's polar opposite. Ingeri is caustic and resentful, her visage scared from a hard life, and her belly swollen with child. She hates Karin with a burning passion which seems born of jealousy. The first time we see her, she is praying to Odin that great misfortune will befall Karin. I can hardly guess what she's been through to make her so embittered at her age, but I pity her.\r\n\tKarin's death is shown openly but not graphically. No doubt is left of what happens to her, or of her assailant's depravity, but there is no nudity or attempt to shock the viewer. The father's revenge is handled in the same manner. The rouges die violently and painfully, but it is done quickly, and with a minimum of blood and gore. They got no less than what they deserved, or at least the older brothers did. The father goes too far in killing the younger brother, who was no more than a child himself. But he realizes this as soon as his rage is passed, and is filled with remorse for what he has done.\r\n\tWhat left the greatest impression on me was the ending, in which the family sets out to retrieve their daughter's body. Bergman does a masterful job of showing how the father, the mother, and even Ingeri deal with their grief and their perceived guilt as they travel the forest path. But even more powerful is the father's action upon finding the slain body of his only daughter. Falling to his knees he breaks down and shouts to the heavens \"You saw this...  You allowed it to happen. I do not understand you. I do not understand you, but still I seek your forgiveness. It is the only redemption I know. \r\n\tIn the midst of great tragedy, when he has every reason to despise life and doubt God, he instead turns to faith, and from loss comes renewed commitment, and a symbol of new life. This is what makes Bergman's The Virgin Spring a truly great film.",

Him playing such a peaceful and religious father one minute and a warpath the next is a little shocking and a ridiculously well done tactic in terms of character development. \nAs always with Bergman, this is a truly beautiful looking movie. Every shot is so well composed and captures the landscape and characters so well. It sort've becomes the third part of the unofficial trilogy, also consisting of The Seventh Seal and The Magician.

            "content": "This is a stunning Ingmar Bergman film. Set in 14th century Sweden, it tells the story about Karin who is brutally raped and murdered before the perpetrators unwittingly arrive at her parent's house asking for shelter. Whilst there, they offer the mother clothes allegedly belonging to their dead sister in exchange for payment. Instantly recognising them as the clothes she had dressed her daughter in that day before she went missing, and seeing the blood stains on them, she alerts her husband (Max Von Sydow) and they take little time in deciding the fate of their guests.\n\nUnlike the infamous Last House On The Left (which although cites Virgin Spring as an influence, it is more of a remake), Bergman's family are god fearing and the violence is not sustained longer than it needs to be. There is contemplation and regret and the scenes in which Von Sydow prepares for his acts of revenge by self flagellation with such vigour, followed shortly by him sitting patiently awaiting dawn, contrast vividly from the happy and loving father of the beginning of the film. So too does the scene at the end of the film, when confronted with his daughters body.\n\nEven with the level of violence in today's films, Virgin Spring holds its ground and stands the test of time. Perhaps the purity of Karin's innocence and naivety when meeting her murderers increases the power of the crimes they commit, and perhaps her parent's religious pursuits increases equally the power of their revenge.\n\nThere is a magical simplicity and charm to Virgin Spring that is contrasted by dark and suggestive sub-plot lines. There is the jealous and unruly step sister Ingeri who is pregnant without a husband; the social activities of the perhaps not so innocent Karin; the scene with the bridge keeper in which he offers shelter to Ingeri and yet his motives seem all too sinister; and even that Ingeri prays to Odin, and does not follow the religious beliefs of her parents. \n\nUltimately these contrasts add depth and complexity to the story and complement the natural beauty of Karin and the locations where she lives and journeys, with an undertone of discomfort and evil.",

There is a freedom and purity of the whole environment: actors, settings, dialogue that feels very very real. Bergman displays animal brutality here, and obsessive love, and almost everything that makes us human. I almost shed a tear at the end and the poignancy of the whole final act. I liked the use of music, well, laymen would say lack thereof but I'd beg to differ. All the music in the film, the little there was, was initiated by the characters, it was an element.

This movie tells the story in a much more artistic way and places it in the era of the original fable, 14th century Sweden.  This Oscar winning film (Best Foreign Language Film-1960) takes its time to set up our characters, but with out gory SFX or nudity the rape/murder scene is still gut wrenching and the revenge killings are still shocking and brutal.  The acting is not too bad.  Max von Sydow is the main shining star of the cast as the devout and vengeful father.  The effects are well done for the period and they get the point across with out buckets of stage blood.  The music score is good enough, though nothing special to be honest.  I thought for a long time that Wes Craven's shocking exploitation film was original.  Now I know that it has very high brow roots in this Academy Award winning depiction of an old Swedish fable.\r\n\r\nNotes: HV-BN-SV\t\tSuggested Age: 13+",

This is one of the few viking movies in the world. It's a damn good movie! It's not a funny movie. But it is definitely a viking movie. Ensconced between a dialectical juxtaposition of pagan vs. Christian symbolism is a taut story beautifully photographed by Sven Nykvist. Von Sydow is iconic in his portrayal of a stricken farmer bent on revenge against the men who murdered his daughter. We love the details, the authentic farm, built on high ground, the pagan rituals and inscriptions, the servant girl praying to Odin, von Sydow's stunning performance as he prostrates himself before the always-silent Christan God. Bergman seems in this one to have balanced his interest in mystical beliefs in opposition to Christian certainty. Here the beliefs in the old Gods yield darkness and crime linked to carnal excess, the very energy the Christians were tamping down. In some respects the argument is simplified as we are dealing with a tragic crime. What is apparent is God's silence, or at least the hint towards it that would figure more strongly in the coming decade of Bergman's filmmaking. Silent or not, human excess seems in need of reigning in. Curious that Bergman is at the same time so apparently resistant to other aspects of Christian worship. It's almost as if he's tossed the baby out with the bathwater. In this film the story is more concrete, set in the past, based on an ancient ballad, almost a recreation in its historical accuracy. The more introspective explorations were to come. A perfect double bill with Seventh Seal.",

            "content": "\"God...I don't understand you!\"\r\n\r\nSo Max von Sydow, as an anguished father, cries out in the closing scene of Ingmar Bergman's great The Virgin Spring (1960).  The moment, when it comes, is inevitable: the end of a path paved by torment and loss of faith.\r\n\r\nI've long suspected that Bergman (1918-2007) was the cinema's greatest director; after my second viewing of The Virgin Spring, I'm sure of it.  And if Bergman was the greatest director, then so too was Sven Nykvist (1922-2006), his long-time collaborator, the best of all cinematographers, a master lensman who understood better than anyone else the awesome power of light and shadow.\r\n\r\nFilmed in exquisite black-and-white, Spring is a devastating meditation on mercy, retribution, and the fine line that separates the the two.  Bookending the story are two startling acts of violence, made all the more shocking by the overall quiet tone of the film; both moments are anticipated--even expected--but nothing prepares us for their sheer brutality.\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on an 18th-century ballad, the story centers on a young maiden who, while delivering candles to the church for matins, is savagely raped and murdered by a trio of highwaymen--among them, a young boy.  In a bizarre twist of fate, the killers seek refuge in the home of the girl's parents.  One of the trio offers a dress from their victim to the mother as repayment for her kindness, setting in motion the third act, as the parents, now fully aware of their little girl's fate, decide what to do with her killers.\r\n\r\nIf all of this sounds vaguely familiar, it's because Wes Craven sourced The Virgin Spring for his classic 1972 shocker, The Last House on the Left.  And while Craven's update is certainly violent and disturbing, and moderately effective in its own way, it's weightless when compared to the anguish the father of Bergman's version experiences, as he quietly weighs his faith in God against the need for primal vengeance.  Indeed, there's a magnificent sequence near the end, where von Sydow sits at a table and rummages through the trio's belongings, simply thinking about what he plans to do.  As he does so, morning sunlight filters through the window, illuminating him--and his decision.  Craven, in his haste for exploitation, failed to include what Bergman surely knew was the defining moment of his own film.\r\n\r\nThe closing scene I mentioned above comes as von Sydow kneels by a stream, mere feet from his child's lifeless body.  He curses the heavens, not only for his daughter's murder, but for his own vicious act.  It's a powerful, heartbreaking moment, a parallel to Bergman's own long-held belief that God remains largely absent in times of need.\r\n\r\nThe Virgin Spring is a great film--one of the greatest--and should be seen by anyone who isn't afraid to be profoundly moved by the medium.",

            "content": "After thinking about this film for hours on end, I feel like I have finally come to some sort of conclusion.  This is perhaps Bergman's least cynical film about faith and God.  By the story line itself, The Virgin Spring seems like it would be the most cynical, but the ending is what makes the film so beautiful.  \n\n***Spoilers***\n\nKarin is loved by her mother and father for being so pure and innocent.  If I had a friend like this, I would beat the hell out of anyone who would even hit on her.  On her way to church to carry the virgin candle Karin is raped and murdered.  This scene is so powerful, and through parts of it Bergman makes you sit in silence.  He cuts off all sound and you must sit and watch the (a complete understatement but lack of better word) uncomfortable taking of a girl's purity.  Remember, this was not just some ordinary day, but on a day where she is going to church.  Later, Tore is asking why God would not protect her.  He obviously has doubts about whether or not he is there.  His absence is noticeable, which seems to be a common theme in Bergman's films.  He goes to Ingeri, who is a pagan girl, and asks for her help.  Tore knows that revenge won't come from a Christian God, so he goes to paganism.  We know this because he starts whipping himself with branches with Ingeri watching him.  The way it's done seems more pagan than Christian.  However, even after the revenge takes place Tore still prays to God, and promises God that he will build a church where his daughter's body lies.  Once they remove her body, a stream of water begins to flow.  God is with them now.  They all feel this overwhelming feel of comfort in this difficult time, and even Ingeri baptizes herself in the water.  Most of this is not directly stated within the film, but this is what I believe to be what happens.  The fact that something described in this way, yet could not be correct is popular among Bergman's films.  He gives enough information for the viewer, and typically tells it in a form of a narrative and still allows the audience to analyze it in their own way.  This film is perfect in every way, and I hope to see it again soon.",
