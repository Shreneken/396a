    "summary": "The deep conversation between a Japanese architect (Eiji Okada) and a French actress (Emmanuelle Riva) forms the basis of this celebrated French film, considered one of the vanguard productions of the French New Wave. Set in Hiroshima after the end of World War II, the couple -- lovers turned friends -- recount, over many hours, previous romances and life experiences. The two intertwine their stories about the past with pondering the devastation wrought by the atomic bomb dropped on the city.",

Over the period of a couple of days, she engages in a brief but torrid love affair with Lui (Eiji Okada), an architect, while recounting her affair with a German officer and reconciling the fact that Lui will soon be nothing more than a vague and fleeting memory.  Hiroshima Mon Amour, Alain Resnais' first film, is a challenging and satisfying observation of pain and suffering, beautifully shot and intelligently scripted, that will linger with the viewer long after it is over.  Hiroshima Mon Amour is one of those rare films that becomes more rewarding with each additional viewing.",

            "content": "\"Hiroshima, Mon Amour\" is a poetically beautiful and haunting story dealing with memory and forgetting, trauma and healing, dreams and fears,  love, witnessing and sharing, emotions and time.  The prologue is remarkable cinematography that encapsulates the underlying themes. The past, present and future are woven into a love affair between an actress who comes to Hiroshima to act in a film about peace and a Japanese architect. She had suffered losses during the 1944 German occupation of Nevers, France when she fell in love with a German soldier; he was off to war at the time his city was catastrophically bombed. They fall deeply in love a day before she is to return home. Their relationship leads us through their painful as well as joyous histories that live in their bodies and souls, that live in their respective countries. The reverent sharing of the past creates new memories which may mean they alter or forget the past. A powerful film you need to watch. \n\"Hiroshima, Mon Amour\" directed by Alain Renais, 1959",

            "content": "With its repetitive and often self-contradictory dialogue, it's easy in the modern day to dismiss Hiroshima mon amour as pretentious relatively quickly in the quarter-hour monologue that introduces the film prior to the actual appearance of its protagonists. However, this is the French New Wave, where such techniques were actually avant-garde before they were co-opted by decades of film students. Resnais employs clever use of flashbacks and stark cinematography to create a desolate portrait of love and loss in war, overtly exploring the role of memory in this traumatic experience that depicts romance and devastation as inseparably intertwined. A spontaneous but deeply powerful emotional connection allows the pair to revive deeply buried emotional trauma in a particularly candid manner, and both Okada and particularly Riva bring these pained personas to the screen with surprising intensity. A major film of the French New Wave, it's easy to see why some consider this to be Resnais' masterpiece. Can't imagine the tortured love between a French woman who participated in 'collaboration horizontale' and a Japanese veteran of WWII would have been standard viewing in wholesome American households fresh out of McCarthyism. (4.5/5)",

            "content": "An extramarital affair occurs between a Japanese architect and a French filmmaker during the horrific time period when an atomic bomb was dropped. Hiroshima Mon Amour has a wonderful concept, yet there were a few things missing that caused it to miss the mark for me.\n\nActing: 10\n\nBeginning: 10\nThe film begins with two lovers locked in a nude embrace. As they exchange dialogue, you feel their sensual connection. It's not long before that shot cuts to images of people in hospitals deeply affected by the atomic bomb. It's a harrowing sequence and a wonderful way to start a movie.\n\nCharacters: 4\nThis is probably one of the areas where I struggled the most when watching this movie. I never found myself invested in the two main characters known simply as He (Eiji Okada) and She (Emmanuelle Riva). I don't know what it was but their stories didn't move me and their personalities felt a bit flat. Seeing as they were pretty much the only characters that carried any kind of weight, it made it hard to really get into the story.\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 10\nNot only is this film beautiful cinematically but It's easily way ahead of its time. The cuts between sensuality and disaster are just sheer genius. Despite my lack of love for the characters, the movie itself is shot in a way that makes you feel, that leaves a jarring impact on you mentally. Very powerful.\n\nConflict: 5\n\nEntertainment Value: 6\n\nMemorability: 8\nBecause of the way it's shot, the overall impact is strong. Unfortunately the movie itself is boring as all get out. I respect it sheerly for it being ahead of its time and being one of those cinematic pieces standing in a class of its own. At the very least, it will definitely stick out in your brain.\n\nPace: 6\nInteresting at times, boring in others. I can see why people love this movie, but relate moreso to those that don't. It drags on in a lot of spots where you're hoping for a speedier resolution.\n\nPlot: 8\n\nResolution: 3\nI originally hated the ending. After going back and watching it again\u2026I just really dislike it. The closure didn't feel fully established leaving me extremely dissatisfied. Here was a chance for redemption and director Alain Resnais dropped the ball in my opinion.\n\nOverall: 70\nHiroshima Mon Amour has flashes of absolute brilliance. Then those flashes get erased by poop. I think it's worth a fair shot if you're into the classics. Who knows, you may disagree with me. After all 89% of audience members did on Rotten Tomatoes.",

It is more realistic and grittier than previous French films of even a few years earlier. Here is a story of a love affair that basically lasts two nights, with the audience learning about a troubled woman's past, one she hasn't disclosed to anyone until she meets her Japanese lover. It is deep and enchanting. The romance is a hanger for the flashbacks to unfold, otherwise the French woman would be talking to herself the whole time (in real life, a sane man would run as fast as he could from a woman he'd just met who had so much \"baggage,\" I'd imagine). The film looks beautiful and the performances are excellent. Both Emmanuelle Riva and Eiji Okada really \"sell it.\" I also enjoyed all the shots of post-War Hiroshima and seeing the characters standing in the exacts spots I have.",

            "content": "A poetic and haunting film about the tragedy of death, the ability people have of picking up the pieces and moving on, and yet history inexorably repeating itself, both in individual lives and with mankind.  It's got an undercurrent of anti-war messaging in it as we see the horrifying results of the atomic bomb in graphic detail, but the film is more than that.  The cinematography is beautiful, both in Hiroshima and the Loire Valley, and director Alain Resnais tells the story brilliantly via flashbacks and meaningful little moments, those which would stand out in one's memory.  \n\nThe premise is fairly simple: a French woman (Emmanuelle Riva) has a short affair with a Japanese man (Eiji Okada) while she's in Hiroshima acting in a film, but both of them know it's short-lived.  They're both married, she's due to fly back to France, and she confesses that she's never gotten over a forbidden affair she had as a teenager with a German soldier fourteen years earlier, during the war.  She's still traumatized by this, so much so that she sees this new lover as a version of the man she knew from the past, and a pale version at that.  As she speaks about it, she uses pronouns as if she were still talking to her old lover, and we can see from the flashbacks just how crushed she was - driven to madness, shunned by the French townspeople as a traitor, and made to live silently in a cold cellar by her parents.  It's a harrowing tale.\n\nThe love she has in Hiroshima has some incredible erotic moments, even if they are brief and restrained. Keep an eye on Emmanuelle Riva's hands in this film as she caresses him; they are so loving.  And yet, the film is quite brutal in its honesty, and he's forced to hear both her memories from the past and, towards the end, see another man approach her, visualizing how replaceable he is.  He's just a link in a chain for her, just as she is for him.  \"I meet you. I remember you. Who are you?\" she says, and \"I don't mind being like a thousand women to you.\"  It's a cynical view of love that may leave you cold, particularly as Marguerite Duras' script borders on pretentiousness at times.\n\nIn putting the tragedy of a single soldier's death next to the death of hundreds of thousands of people at Hiroshima, it reinforces how tragic all of those lives lost were; they all had their own stories, even if in both cases they were part of \"the enemy.\"  However, it's even more tragic when we reflect that mankind will move on, soon forget, and repeat the same mistakes, just as lovers move on, soon forget, and meet new lovers.  We see a dual to the horror of forgetting war when he says \"Some years from now, when I have forgotten you and other romances like this one have recurred through sheer habit, I will remember you as a symbol of love's forgetfulness. This affair will remind me how horrible forgetting is.\"  This is echoed in her lines \"Just as in love, there is this illusion, this illusion that you will never be able to forget, the way I had the illusion, faced with Hiroshima, that I would never forget.\"  Forgetting to some extent is necessary to heal and move on even when it seems impossible, and yet it can also be inevitable, and render what we forget meaningless.  It's interesting to think about.\n\nOne of the little scenes early on that I loved was when he visits her 'peace movie' set, and the two of them begin talking.  As she smiles at him in the sunshine, a demonstrator walks by carrying a picture of a victim of the bombing, which is a somber juxtaposition, and yet so subtly executed by Resnais.  There are countless other moments, including when we see the various places she and the German soldier find to carry on with each other, which has overtones of cheapness and lust, and yet, also love trying to find a way in an impossible time.  Just as she's irreparably damaged by the love of her life's death, so mankind seems irreparably changed after the Hiroshima bombing.  What a fascinating response she has to his question about what Hiroshima meant to her: \"The end of the war... completely, I mean. Astonishment that they dared, astonishment that they succeeded.  And for us, the start of an unknown fear.  Then, indifference. And fear of that indifference.\"  It's an existential moment in a brave new world, and perhaps that's what this film really is - an existential romance, one that is devastating.",

Nothing was perfect about the picture but people seem to give it between 4 and 5 stars and I get it. Push that aside though because there is a raw, seething, emotion throughout that sucks you in, quickly, and doesn't let go until love walks out on you. The film works just as well as an historical document as it does a love story. Watching it in 2015 acts as a reminder of the lives of Europeans and Japanese people during World War Two forcing you to see beyond the villain that we have been trained to see.",

It seemed that she was tortured after the war.she needed to overcome her tragedy.I hope Hiroshima's recovery gave her some hope.\n\n- Japanese man\nThis person lost his family by  A-bomb.I still don't understand why he was able to speak French.This actor was Mr.Eiji Okada. He was one of the legend in Japanese movie industry 1950's. He took her to a Japanese restaurant. They couldn't enjoy cheerful and nice conversation.When they were dating, they were talking about her past relationships with the Nazi offices. But he is still chasing her.Okada's performance was expressive although I can't judge his French skills.\n\n- 1950's Hiroshima. I personally enjoyed Hiroshima in the 1950's. After A-bomb, many people believed that this city was dead.But Hiroshima recovered from A-bomb.People were ver cheerful.They enjoy dating, socializing and eating&drinking. I liked one scene. When the French women was sitting alone. One Japanese man spoke English to her and asking her to go out! Whenever japanese saw caucasians or white people, they instantly believe that the whites are Americans. What a bold guy he was! \n\n- Personally, I put three stars.This was not my favorite.Too much melancholic and sad stories.

It's not just the narrative, but the characters themselves. \n\nHow can a movie about a French women's affair with a Japanese man on the cusp of WW2 be so dull? They regard the war, each other, and even themselves with what seems like boredom. Maybe that's the point though? Or maybe the film was just lost on me. Like most of  French New Wave though, the soundtrack is pretty much perfect. The passages where the  score pulses underneath montages of Japan while the lovers talk back and forth in voiceover hit all the themes in such an effective way that it's a wonder that certain other scenes in the film exist.\n\nFor example, near the end the two are at some bar, sitting separately from each other. An older woman asks the Japanese man what's wrong. He then, in one chunk of uninterrupted dialogue, literally tells the old lady the film's whole plot until that point: they're lovers, but that they have to part, and that they're both sad about it. Literally that's it. The lady then says nothing and the movie moves on and no longer cares about her. Why does this scene exist at all? We learn nothing new. Whatever the characters were feeling gets neutered to the audience because of a chunk of expository dialogue.",

            "content": "\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" is a beautiful, beautiful film.  While it remains today to be one of the first examples of the beginning of the French New Wave, I like to think of it in a completely different light, because this time it isn't as excited about being modern as it is simply to be innovative, and tell a story that appears heartbreaking, but remains mysterious the more you think about it.  This is an excellent film that is truly one of the best films of the 1950s.\n\tThe story is hard to explain.  Even though it revolves around the affair between a French actress (Emmanuelle Riva) and a Japanese architect (Eiji Okada), already taboo enough for the time period, it isn't the focal point of the film.  In fact, it remains a background all the while intriguing us.  The actress, who remains nameless, is married to a man for money yet seems emotionally unstable in a way that's hard to tell at first, and she doesn't want the affair to last; the architect, who stays without a name as well, is happily married but apparently is seeing the actress just because he can.  While they both should be rotten human beings in our minds, we can help but be fascinated by them.  \n\tThe actress is in the town of Hiroshima to film a movie revolving around the 1945 bombing of the city, and while at first it just seems to be the reason why she's there, it becomes the core of the film, even a bigger oddity.  What's even more shocking, is while the Japanese were suffering during the bombing, she was in pain as well but for different reasons.\n\t\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" begins as though it could be one of those sexy foreign dramas that could stir audiences with a blink of an eye, but slowly but surely it becomes a little bit more bleak, but the pacing that Alain Resnais sets it flawless.  He makes every second of the film feel claustrophobic and melancholy, while it stays subtly romantic.  There's still room for artistic style however, and Resnais proves this by adding in a voiceover that reminds one of Jean-Luc Godard, and using lighting that's reminiscent of film noir.\n\tWhat I'll always take away from the film though, is Riva's compelling performance.  While she may have not been nominated for an Oscar until recently for \"Amour\", \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" delivers her talents to full effect, to the point in which it makes the film better than it has any right to be.  Most femmes in these kinds of films look pretty but don't have much range (hem hem, Anna Karina), but Riva is emotional and embodies the role.  Her character goes through so much, and even though it isn't apparent at first, you can tell there's something behind her cool as ice fa\u00e7ade.  She's fantastic.\n\t\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" on the outside just seems like another experiment, but it truly is much more fascinating than I expected.  This is filmmaking at its finest, and it's wonderful to think this is one of the films that caused modern day filmmaking.  Recommended.",

No idea if this was his intention, but it seemed to me like Resnais was trying to explain the inhuman catastrophy that Hiroshima was and the fear from the atomic bomb through the personal love story of a man and a woman.\nA love story so basical that it seems ridiculous to even compare it to the existence-threatening power of the atomic bomb. But this power is so inconceivable that it's maybe only graspable when it's broken down into basic human experience.\n\nI see Hiroshima mon amour as a projection and retrojection of big-scale and small-scale disaster.\nHaving said that, I still can't integrate the flashbacks and backstory of the French Woman. The flashbacks show us small-town life in more innocent times before the cruelty of Hiroshima, and, later on, the ordeal of a young defiled woman. Both of which not really help to understand the present situation. Neither did I really understand the relation between the young German soldier and her Japanese lover, beside the fact that they were both forbidden loves.\n\nHiroshima mon amour has to be decoded, wants to be decoded. Few films so happily endeavour in tying a knot for its viewer while not abandoning a clear narrative. Hiroshima mon amour works without twists or narrative gimmicks but with relations of dialogue and images, of present and past.",

The film opens with a one night stand between a French actress and a Japanese architect who rendezvous one night in Hiroshima. In the short time they spend together, she reflects on her memories of the city that was not too long ago devastated by the atomic bomb. He often rejects her recollections but nevertheless he cannot bear for her to leave and he continues to pursue her. Eventually in the course of their time together she relates her days back in the town of Nevers in France. During the occupation during the war she had a beau who was German and was eventually killed. The events and aftermath haunted her even many years later. They spend some of their time together walking the streets of Hiroshima and with their time running out they vow to remember each other by Hiroshima and Nevers respectively because their real names are never mentioned. This film begins very much like a documentary on Hiroshima but very quickly it turns into a character study focusing on ideas of love, memory, and personal identity. This film is more about art and expression and it uses quick flashbacks to replicate the past with voice-overs bringing the audience back to the present.

Yes, it is a truly impressive exercise in innovative filmmaking technique (it is the film that has deeply influenced the French New Wave), but buried deep within all its picturesque framings and compositions is a beating heart and a crying soul. \n     \nWith a quietly affectionate screenplay written by Marguerite Duras that contains stream of consciousness dialogues that's as romantically longing as they are emotionally detached, \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" conveys its power through its two main characters' internal articulacy. They speak in a manner that transcends the limitations of the tongue. They speak as if their feelings overlap with their vocabularies. They converse as if they see through each other's hearts. A French actress (Emmanuelle Riva) and a Japanese architect (Eiji Okada), the two of them represent the confusion we call love and the despairing post-romantic reality we call pain. They both know that they want each other but they just can't do it. \n     \nIn the film's early scenes, we see how happy the French actress is when she's with the architect (shot in effective close-ups). But slowly and effectively, director Alain Resnais was able to construct her ironically fractured past by way of fragmentary flashbacks in Nevers, France that's as dream-like as the cityscapes of post-war Hiroshima. Sporting a haircut like that of Maria Falconetti in \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" in the past, the French actress, just like the aforementioned saint, is a martyr, but not in the context of religion but of love. \n     \nResnais has highlighted the fact that, like all women, the French actress just wants to feel love more than anything else but is deeply scarred to try yet again. She consummates the meager sexual pleasures with the architect but she's too afraid to go beyond that. She wants to feel once more. She wants to erase the past, forget and fall in love again but just can't because she knows that she won't be ready yet. \n     \nThere's this powerful scene in the film where the actress is telling the architect the story of how she once loved a German soldier back in Nevers, France when suddenly, the architect seems to take on the identity of the deceased German lover as he identifies more and more with the story. The actress, on the other hand, lost in her own romantic recollection, unconsciously talks back to the architect as if she's talking to the German himself. Despite of her new-found connection with the Japanese gentleman, she still struggles to see herself together with other men other than her tragic lover. She's a captive of her own painful memories.\n     \nWith a slightly upbeat musical score that seems to mock the utter desperation in the French actress and the Japanese architect's happenstance romance, \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" is a film that does not scoff at the idea of love outside marriage but instead seems to mourn the idea as to why should this limitation exist. Although that's just a mere observation from yours truly, I just can't help but feel that aside from the French actress' inescapably scarred past, what may also be holding them back is the simple fact that they are both married. \n     \nThere's this scene in the film where both of them, standing quietly across each other in a living room, straightforwardly expressed their utmost admirations to their respective husband and wife. Sure, for some reasons explainable only by the heart, they want to be with each other, but they are also aware of the fact that their marriages are too good to be on the losing end of their intended romantic transgression. \n     \nIn another key scene, notice how the architect is chasing the actress through the streets of Hiroshima yet the latter keeps on moving and the former, uncharacteristic for a person who wants to catch up with someone, merely preferred to trail her. They want to hold each other yet they also want distance and space. \"You're destroying me. You're good for me\", the actress told the architect while they are presumably making love in the earlier moments of the film. There's the paradox of their romance right there. \n     \n\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\", aside from being a landmark film that has launched an entire cinematic movement, is an unforgettable love story not of two people but of two longing souls who, because of circumstances, just can't be together. \"You saw nothing in Hiroshima\", the Japanese architect said to the actress in the film's early scenes. Maybe that's what they need to believe in to properly move on.",

            "content": "Alain Resnais, who directed this movie, didn't consider himself part of the French New Wave, and so I won't call this a New Wave movie; if it were, though, it would be one of the best of the New Wave movies. It's not really like any other movie I've seen; it's definitely unlike anything that had been made before it. It's hard to say precisely what the movie's effect or intent is, but it's definitely good. \n\nThe first ten or fifteen minutes of the movie give us a conversation about the bombing of Hiroshima, mostly in voiceover, as we see various images of the aftermath of the bombing. I think most if not all of the imagery of Hiroshima post-bombing is actual documentary footage. The effect is to document Hiroshima in much the same way Resnais's earlier film Night and Fog had documented Auschwitz. After this extraordinary opening sequence, we finally actually meet the main characters, of whom we had previously only seen backs and hands and heard their voices. They turn out to be a French actress and a Japanese architect having a brief adulterous affair. Throughout the rest of the movie, we follow the couple (mostly the actress) as they talk and remember what happened to them during the war. \n\nEmmanuelle Riva is extraordinarily good as the actress. She seems very happy at first, but eventually we piece together her tragic past, and she reveals deep unhappiness. We don't learn as much about Eiji Okada's architect character, but I guess the opening scenes suggest that the trauma for the Japanese of Hiroshima is too big to be adequately represented anyway. Okada's performance is also very good, in any event.\n\nWhat makes this such a famous and special movie, besides the opening documentation of post-bombing Hiroshima, is the way the narrative unfolds and particularly the way in which memory is represented. I wrote a little while ago about Citizen Kane's groundbreaking use of flashbacks. In Citizen Kane, the flashbacks are usually fairly long, self-contained scenes that are clearly demarcated as flashbacks. This movie, written by French writer Marguerite Duras, took flashbacks a step further than Kane had. Here, flashbacks are often presented in incomplete, short, fragmentary ways that might not initially make too much sense. You see an image, and only later are you able to piece together how everything fits and what actually happened in the story. The effect is not unlike narration in modernist writers like Faulkner or Joyce (although it's a heck of a lot easier to figure out than Ulysses). In addition to all this, the movie looks great; Resnais is a visually interesting as well as narratively innovative filmmaker. This is one very creative and very important movie, and I'm surprised by how little I had heard of it before.",

Yet unlike Night and Fog, the documentary doesn't feel objective,  but rather personal & distant. Here Resnais displays the inability to cope with a horror of this magnitude. He even shows clips of a Japanese reenactment as part of this woman's mental process in the mueseum, which serves to show how the woman will never know the extent of the tragedy and her thoughts of it are reduced to vapid and shallow conjecture. \r\nIt is a film about memory and identity. The film revolves around two lovers who wish to escape the horrors of their past but still retain the beauty which they previously experienced. It is about the necessity of forgetfulness, but also the overwhelming fear that accompanies it. \r\nResnais also focuses a lot on the skin of the lovers which highlights the frailty of man, which was a crucial idea during the filming of this in 1958 when the threat of nuclear war with the Soviet Union was ubiquitous.\r\nAlthough some scenes feel rather laborious to get through, it is a very important film and one that is bound to stir up many emotions in the viewer.",

Afterwards, the film focuses entirely on the couple, who are never given names.  Just 'she' and 'him'.  The movie is, essentially, one long discussion and there are no side characters at all.\n\nDuring these moments of intimacy, the two bare their souls and relate their horrific experiences from the war finding empathy and comfort in the company of a stranger.  These are beautifully done, with the two touching faces in a cafe' with the neon glow of the city in the background.  It's an absolutely gorgeous movie, wonderfully shot in black and white.  It would not have been the same in color.\n\nA precursor to the whole French New Wave movement and films like 'Lost in Translation', this was also the first film to use jump cuts to and from flashbacks as well as brief flashbacks to suggest obtrusive memories.\n\nOn a personal note, having been to Hiroshima, it was interesting to see how the city has changed in the 50 years between my visit and when the film was made.",

It is pretty innovative for it's time, however, but it is a bore to watch. A barely passable film-watching experience.",

I can never forgive Resnais for Last year at Marienbad, so I give all the kudos to Marguerita Duras' script, the Japanese crew and both actors. Rewatching it after years, I noticed the similarity with Japanese anime. Wonder if this film inspired the Japanese, or vice-versa?",
