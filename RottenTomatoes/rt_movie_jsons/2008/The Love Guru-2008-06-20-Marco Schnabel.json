I believe this movie is genuinely funny if you were into Michael Myers comedy as well. As an avid hockey fan, I also appreciate that hockey is included in this movie as it is very underrepresented in film today. I believe the people who really gave this movie a bad review are not the ones that should be watching it. This movie is for a select smaller group that finds slapstick comedy more funny. This movie does not make you think but it doesn't make you laugh.",

It's a vehicle for Meyers, who does this sort of broad, over-the-top character as good as any of his SNL buddies. But he gets too indulgent here, stringing along a funny premise on a paper-thin plot with endless penis, midget, poop, and sex jokes. The director's inability to make the gags stick doesn't help. There is some satire here but not enough. Meyers scores laughs on and off. You know there's a problem when Justin Timberlake (hilarious in a wig, moustache, and silly accent) is the funniest thing in your movie. Romany Malco is wasted, Jessica Alba and Meagan Good are merely eye candy, some cameos score, and Stephen Colbert is almost as funny as he is on his show. Some laughs, a few nice song and dance numbers, and the outrageous Timberlake make this almost watchable, but Meyers all but kills the potential this had with his comedic self-indulgence. Disappointing",

I'd say out of all the Meyers' films, this is one of the best written, but, it fails the parody in places. While it's obvious the makers had their ear to Hinduism and Buddhism, it's not as booby-trapped with those myths like a Mel Brooks or Monty Python spiritual comedy. Maybe they consulted eastern philosophers while making this, but, you can tell they didn't grow up in it like Kevin Smith did in his Catholic Dogma, because this film could be a lot more than it was.\n\nJessica Alba is horrible in this, like she can barely contain the hatred for her own part while she smiles like Vaseline has been rubbed all over her teeth. She is a very successful business woman, and it is clear from this film that's the lane should drive in. \n\nJustin Timberlake can hang with super-jokers like Meyers, and he does a good enough job, but, he's like Wonderbread; the name makes you want to eat it, but, you realize it isn't particularly nutritious and is only created for its shelf life. \n\nHindu and Buddhist myths are so wonderful, many times you can be creating something and turn to the myths and find it has already been created, and then you can toy with the two creations meeting again. I don't think that was done here, and they missed out by not studying their subjects more before filming.",

Unless you find Mariska Hargitay's name amusing - which is particularly relevant as her name is used as a punchline for an amazingly lengthy part of the movie and somehow remains the comedic highlight. Apart from a 5 second sequence when Myers's character is listening to a radio and \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" appears. At which point he looks up to the camera in a knowing way. It's very much like even he knows how far apart in quality the movies are yet is still willing to try and coax you into a cesspool of toilet gags/rancid \"puns\"/borderline offensive ethnic stereotypes and a feeling you are being fleeced with every passing second you remain seated in watching this dross.",

But soon after, people got tired of his shtick really fast after seeing the ultimate sunken ship of his career, The Love Guru. This story about Maurice Pitka (Mike Myers), the Hollywood sex guru one star below Deepak Chopra, who's tasked to retie a knot between Maple Leaf player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) and his wife Prudence (Meagan Good) in order to win the Stanley Cup, became a box office and critical flop in 2008. Seeing this movie today, it's hard not to miss why. Unlike Myers's previous characters, Maurice doesn't have much of a personality, aside from a bad Indian stereotype who spouts out preschool-level bathroom humor and even worse sexual double entendres. As for the supporting cast, Jessica Alba looks like she's waiting in line for the catering table as the Leafs manager and cookie-cutter love interest Jane. Academy Award winner Ben Kingsley is watching his career slowly wilting as the cross-eyed elder guru Tugginmypudha. Verne Troyer is once again type-casted as the punchline for jokes about\u2026 you know what, as well as Coach Cherkov. The movie also features an odd line of celebrity cameos from Val Kilmer, Mariska Hargitay, and Kanye West, who are all identified by name, which ruins the joke of a cameo. As far as career-ruining pictures as concerned, The Love Guru is one unfunny dead zone. (1 \u00bd D.R.A.M.A.TM Tattoos out of 5)",

This movie is comedy gold on the cast's behalf. The characters throughout the movie have well-placed side plots that all add up in the end. An awesome script that seems like natural comedy creates a flowing script, an example including the alligator soup being snappy joke. I understand that to some people this might not be funny, but in order to get the most out of the movie, you have to look at it the way it was intended to be looked at.

Sophistication it doesn't have -- I think there's even a knock-knock joke in it -- but how can you hate a movie that includes a parody of one of those Bollywood song and dance numbers and turns Verne Troyer (Mini-Me in the \"Austin Powers\" movies) into a human hockey puck.

Blink and you might miss it, too. I hate this movie so very much. I liked Austin Powers. I liked Shrek. Mike Meyers' sense of humor can work. But this is inexcusable. There is not a single character who has so much as an actual personality. Mike Meyer's character is just a stupid accent who has an infinite supply of fart jokes. Justin Timberlake barely says anything, Jessica Alba doesn't even react to the wildly bizarre things Meyers says, and poor Ben Kingsley must have been in a contract with Paramount to have the 15 minutes of screen time he has. There are a lot of pointless cameos, a lot of racially insensitive themes, and a lot of gratuitous sequences. Like there's this one part, totally out of nowhere, where Mike Meyers, for no reason, forces two elephants to hump. For absolutely no reason. I guess this might have worked if it was just in the middle of the movie, but no, this acts as a climax for this atrocity. It is the most important part of the movie. Everything in acts 1 and 2 was building up to this, and everything in act 3 builds off of this. It's never explained but for whatever reason, we're supposed to believe that what we just witnessed is a major element of the movie.

People that usually do not write reviews went out of their way to ensure that this film would not do well at the box office. Barack Obama among those that felt they needed to tell the world not to see this movie. That being said, I think it is fascinating to speculate about what about the movie they felt so offensive. Is it really with the type of humor? I mean after all this film is on par with the grossness levels of his other films, but nobody seemed to have a problem with them. Is it with the way that Mike Myers portrays the Hinduism? Although the Hindu American Foundation did report that the movie was crude and vulgar (which is kind of like stating the obvious right?), they did not report the movie was anti-Hindu. And how could it be. Mike Myers apparently went through a very serious depression after his father died. He talked about it in a very strange interview with Terry Gross on Fresh Air. Mike Myers apparently was deeply helped by Hindu influenced spirituality. The movie is overwhelmingly positive in regard to Hindu influenced spirituality that he himself benefited from. This I believe to be what individuals like Barack Obama had a problem with in the Love Guru. The movie had some funny moments, but I think it is noble of Mike Myers to try to provide a positive message for a change. It is awful that individuals would discourage positive messages in comedies. \n\nThe movie is truly insane, but it is very typical Mike Myers. Jim Gaffigan in particular was very funny in this movie. \n\nIf you do not like a movie, just be honest with why. I do not like George Clooney and cannot watch a movie with him as a lead, but I do not pretend that all of his movies are bad. \n\nThis movie is in a different world where Mike Myers and Jessica Alba get together, a Little Person is a professional hockey coach (which is not strange in itself), but he has a tiny office that is just bizarre, and many more just bizarre choices -- it is almost like watching something like Brazil where no logic is provided for the bizarreness of the events that transpire.",
