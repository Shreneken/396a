    "summary": "A life-shattering secret torments Ben Thomas (Will Smith). In order to find redemption, he sets out to change the lives of seven strangers. Over the course of his journey, he meets and falls in love with a cardiac patient named Emily (Rosario Dawson), and in so doing, complicates his mission.",

            "content": "Could've been so much better. Although I do like the approach on how the story was told, it was riddled with sloppy filmmaking. It had way too many plot holes that could've easily been avoided with a tighter screenplay and/or better directing. All casting and performances were great, although Smith was awkward in some scenes - not the ones he was supposed to be awkward in. The cinematography and score was spot on, and the 123 min runtime flew by with the decent pacing. I'm not sure why the critics were so hard on this film, it's a unique story told in about the best way it could've been told without becoming overly predictable. It's too bad it fell short of being a great film with all the rookie filmmaking mistakes. Nevertheless, it's a well deserving 7/10 from me.",

            "content": "I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews, maybe people start to have rotten tomatoes in their heads after being \"top critics\" for so many years. The movie is for those who still have their souls awake. It's hard to stay indifferent to the topic. This movie is touching, very emotional and reminds about the beauty of repentance, when ego is not winning over the power of character/will anymore. Of course philosophically/religiously there can be different approaches to the idea brought up in the movie - sacrifice. I would agree, that some characters are simplified a bit (division for good and bad, it's rarely the case), but overall the movie makes you empathize and think about the bigger picture, significance of life and death, love. If it's true that the plot based on a true story, then it's even more interesting to analyze. Some person wrote in a comment, that the main character was a stupid man. Wow, I wonder what this person will experience in life having these strong opinions today, life is interesting and twisty... Also I think that the average ego can be a bit high to understand deeply the character and reasoning, so subconsciously the movie might be rejected. As for me, even being a bit simplified, the movie is still beautiful. Recommend to watch, although it is a bit sad movie.",

In an Oscar-caliber performance of charisma, guilt, and redemption, he delivers his best performance and his best film since 'The Pursuit of Happyness.' Smith re-teams with the Italian director of that film, Gabriele Muccino, to deliver this gripping and enigmatically-titled drama. It's a weeper, a cryptic mystery, and a winning romance with a righteous message. Smith has a terrific supporting cast in Barry Pepper, Woody Harrelson, Michael Ealy, and Rosario Dawson. Dawson, in particular, is simply outstanding. She all but steals the movie from Smith, and is the one who carries us emotionally through the film. It's not perfect--Muccino and the script lay on the sentiment a bit too much at times--but this is one tear-jerker that genuinely earns those tears",

            "content": "Extremely amusing due to the woefully fake writing and overly simplistic coverage of the topic.  It's objectively not worthy of a positive review. The main character started off as a scumbag, continued to be a scumbag by stalking people and being rude, and then plot twist he was actually such a nice guy because he decided to donate some organs! The woman fell in love with him despite the stalky and rude behaviour, which made zero sense. Furthermore, Will Smith's portrayal of the character almost entirely consisted of two facial expressions - fake smiling and standing in dog poo. Please can someone explain how that's a successful dating strategy and impressive performance. Then there was the typical over the top, unrealistic car crash because someone was on their phone. Whilst that's rightfully illegal, we don't need another film PSA, it shouldn't cause you to dramatically turn the wheel, and a car probably won't roll over like they always show, with one person surviving but the other dying. Another example of stupidity was the ID stealing, which seemed to go unnoticed for ages. I could keep going with specific examples, but in sum, everything lacked believability. The premise was delusional, the romance was predictable cringe, the characters were unrealistic and underdeveloped, Will Smith's acting was laughable, the pacing dragged due to repetitive romantic nonsense, the timeline was a confusing mess, and the emotional element utterly failed. Perhaps the only decent writing was when Will Smith said 'I'd like to report a suicide...me', although him ignoring the motel owner was rather good too. On a more technical level, it felt very average all around from cinematography to editing to visual effects to the soundtrack.",

What could have driven this man so far that he felt the burden to pursue these 'good people's with such intensity and ferocity, all for the purpose of 'helping'? The denouement and the events directly leading up to it answer this question and many others.\n\nFor some, the denouement may be a bit unsettling; but if you recall the intro of the film- and Tim's clear state of mental and emotional unwellness- the denouement is more or less the natural conclusion of that.\n\nThis film is nothing short of fantastic, from the casting to the directing to the editing.\n\nI feel sorry for the ignoramuses who are unable to understand or appreciate this film.

Gabrielle Muccino's tear-jearker hasn't aged well since it was released in 2007. It's an intriguing premise for a movie that is poorly executed. Packed with morose sequences, corny dialogue and a bizarre ending, it offers a prime example of how not to make a melodrama. To be fair, though, the film does have a few merits that are worth mentioning. Will Smith is as always excellent and delivers one of his most moving performances in the lead role. With riveting expressions, he puts viewers into the mindset of a troubled man on the path to redemption. Moreover, the supporting cast is also superb and do the best with the limited material that they are given. Yet, as a whole, even the star-studded cast can't save \"Seven Pounds\" from being a disaster. Fans of tear-jerking melodramas may enjoy \"Seven Pounds\" to a certain degree. However, anyone else is best advised to steer clear of this ill-fated car crash of a movie.",

The last thing that this feature needed is the first and the foremost things that shucks away its credibility and it is the flawed script that makes less and less sense as it ages, since it skips few steps while mending the sequences. \n\nThe background score is decently scored, the cinematography is daft, the editing is amatuer and the camera work is redundantly busy and handled manually in order to give the personal touch to the viewers. Smith is the only reason to survive this blunder, his looks are impactful and his eyes convey poems but even a performance like such could never save this sinking ship. \n\nThis ill formed structure is equally to be blamed as the premise where the heart may be at the right place but that is never enough to attain a closure out of all these hokum formulas. The narration by Nieporte is unappealing and incongruent to its tone, to a point that even Muccino's execution couldn't save this forsaken and untouched land that this tale resides on.

After watching it, I'm now coming here to write about the film. In all honesty, I'm shocked. I'm surprised at how low the score is and how many people heavily dislike this film. Granted, it wasn't a perfect film in anyway shape or form but I thought it was an emotional piece that kept me invested throughout. It seemed to do what it was made to do and while it has its problems, it certainly has some good things going for it. \n\nLet's start by saying I think Will Smith is great. This guy can do so much and this is just another emotional performance from him. I've tended to find a lot of attachment to his films like \"I Am Legend, \"i, Robot\", among others, and I think it's because of how strong he excels in his roles. He's someone who can really bring it up to another level and he did great in this film. Him, along with the rest of the cast, did not fail to meet expectations in the slightest. \n\nYes, I absolutely understood that the plot was illogical. Maybe this couldn't really happen in real life but regardless, I didn't think it was enough to suspend my belief. This was about a man trying to find the right people to give life to and I think that bodes for a great character study. I feel like I was able to see people's different lives and different perspectives and it really touched me. It wasn't a perfect film but I feel like it did its job. \n\nOne thing I also thought was solid was just the overall tone and feel of the film. Like I said, I really did feel invested in this film. I couldn't completely grasp everything that was going on and the ending, although strong, didn't make much sense. There's some story-telling problems here but I felt like the story-tellers wanted you to think. They told the story and left out a big piece of information but that was the fun part to me.\n\nIn the end, \"Seven Pounds\" provides some emotional moments and some great performances. No, it may not be the perfect film but I think it's certainly worth watching and not nearly as bad as everyone is claiming it to be.",

Because of that, the emotional impact of the ending didn't hit me nearly as hard as I think was intended, but there's certainly an uplifting message in there.  At least for me, it was just too difficult to fully accept because you end up connecting with Will Smith's character over the course of the film in a way where you want to see him figure out a better... \"resolution\" to his situation.  I suppose this is just one movie that is almost too close to reality and not enough of a fairy tale, but it definitely makes you think and feel grateful for what you have.",

With the exception of Rosario Dawson, the film doesn't have characters with enough depth for the audience to genuinely care about the final outcome of the movie.  Will Smith is capable of amazing work, and he has several nice delicate scenes of rage and sadness, but overall is feels like a performance that was Oscar bait. For a movie about grief, love and redemption, there are too many surface level emotions created by an extremely talented group of actors.  The director needed to pull more out of his actors for this ending to be worth the journey. Without that emotional depth, the end of the movie almost seems misplaced and unnatural to the rest of the tone throughout, like it's trying too hard to make you feel something instead of actually feeling something.",

You then wish to follow through to see if the main character is what one assumes or is there some other part of him we do not know about.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Do NOT believe the critics' low scores and complaints. It's a huge departure from Smith's usual bombastic roles, and while the subject matter is grim, it also contains an aesthetic of such a high band wave that it will probably be missed by many people who are simply looking to be \"entertained.\" I'm in awe of the script, the acting, sound track and editing.

They say it's one of the best movies to portray redeeming love.

Needed a handful of tissues to dry my tears. But I thought that the actors did a good job, and the story wasn't bad. Yeah, in real life what happened in this story is very unlikely to happen, since there's probably no one that would be that good and self sacrificing. But so are most stories you read in books, unless they are real life account. Yes, the movie can feel morose, but the depression it shows is realistic. Yes, the subject matter is morbid and the religious people will condemn it as immoral and sinful in the eyes of God. Who cares. I like movies that engage my emotions and give me hope that there might actually be human beings worthy of breathing the air they breathe. At first I gave it 4 stars, which is twice a much as most critics and some viewers have rated it. But wasn't sure about the logic of one aspect of the story. So being the nerd that I am, I checked out online to see if it was plausible, and confirmed that it's not, so it has a major error that in real life would greatly affect the outcome of the story. But yeah, it's just a movie, so most people will suspend disbelief or not even notice how illogical the last part of the story is. But because of this error I I lowered my score of it to 3.5 stars. Seems most people don't like it because it's morose or depressing and has a very sad ending, and usually I dislike such movies, but I still found the story and actors engaging. It's a good movie, even with the error in the plot, though would have been much better without the it. The viewers that did like the movie, like I did, like it a lot and recommend it. - I wanted to know what's the meaning of the title so I looked it up. The title refers to Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, in which a debtor must pay a pound of flesh.",

That fact though isn't such a bad thing as this is quite the oddball misfire. The opening half hour is a confusing, poorly constructed mess as Smith comes across as cold, unlikeable weirdo coupled with the fact that he's a tax gatherer making for a lead character that's both hard relate to and even harder to care about. It's also one of those movies that has only one real trick up its sleeve, and it knows it, so it works so hard to shield it from the audience meaning that there's no room for the movie to properly develop early on, pretty much hindering it from the very start. Once it gets going things eventually start to resemble an actual plot, but if anything Smith is just as odd, with his pet jellyfish, serial killer likened creepy mannerisms, and wild swings of generosity. By the end it wants to tie itself into a neat little package, but it's too forced and grim for that to happen leaving both an overly sweet and quite bitter after-taste. So despite Will Smith offering a solid performance and Rosario Dawson being perfectly fine in support, there's no saving a movie with a script that's as broken as this flop.",

            "content": "Will Smith, such a charismatic actor, with the ability to totally light up the screen, plays it straight here. What we get is a powerful yet convieniant and unsurprising piece of cinema. Ben Thomas works of the IRS, going through his day to day life by following the sick and debt ridden and either helping them out of a sticky situation or destroying their reputation. Soon he runs into Emily, a gorgeous woman, with a wonderful outlook on life, however she has a fatal heart condition, which at any moment could kill her. It's about here when Ben begins to look after and fall in love with the fate stricken girl, however the deeper down the rabbit hole we go, the more and more we discover that things are not at all as they seem. Seven Pounds is one of THOSE films. It's gripping, it tugs at the heart strings, it really has quite a bit going for it. But for all its hard work, it feels tainted by the inclusion of Smith himself. Not that his performance is bad, quite the opposite, but his star credentials really make it hard to invest and believe in him as a character. The cast is wonderful. Woody Harrellson does a good job with Ezra, a blind pianist who Ben tries to bully into becoming a better man and follow his dreams, Rosario Dawson pulls out an emotional performance as Emily. Will himself, loses weight and really tries to run with the movie. It's just the movies convieniance and layout make for a very predictable finally. The movie flashes back and forth, Letting us know right from the get go that Smith is up to something, that is not spoiling anything as this films opening scene is Smith dialling 911 to report his own suicide. But we also know straight off the bat that his previous life didn't end happily. What would have worked better, would have been to play Smith's past down somewhat, not ignoring it completely but not laying it on so thick either. In fact intrigue is what this film lacks,any intelligent viewer will see 80% of the twists in this film coming very quickly. Also I have an issue with Smith, his performance is a double edged sword, he does a wonderful job, loses the weight, tries not to act the funny man, too much. But had this have been another actor, either less know or better at being a chameleon this film would have packed a harder punch. Dont get me wrong, this film looks wondeful, the sound is brilliant and even the script has beat after beat which keeps the ship afloat. The visuals of the jelly fish also, you will find out after watching, are also brilliant and some comedic moments here and there really help lighten the mood in places. Its a good film, it just could have been better. And the ending... just a little too convieniant for my liking. a powerful and enjoyable watch but had it been handled with more subtley and finesse we would have had something quite remarkable here.",

The movie follows Will Smith as he tries to find suitable people to donate his organs too and he eventually meets Rosario Dawson and they get a thing going. Not a terrible idea by any means. The guy wants to give his organs to people. That opens all sorts of doors for your movie. You can have the movie ask all sorts of intelligent questions, like \"how do you determine if someone is good or bad?\", and \"is Will Smith justified to judge these people?\". You can have Will Smith develop a strong, emotional connection will the people he's donating too and make for a very engaging film. BUT. They didn't do any of these things. Actually they did the exact opposite. They basically turned this into Will Smith and Rosario Dawson reading a really bad, awkward sounding script while they stand there and look bored. They force a relationship between the two and they focus on that instead of building ties between Will Smith and his organ recipients, and it makes for a ridiculously boring movie. Neither Will Smith's or Rosario Dawson's characters were written with any sort of personality, so you can't really care about them at all. You're stuck with them the whole movie too. It's just painful to watch. Everything else was done incredibly lazy as well. From directing, to editing, to music choice, from cinematography, it's all really, really bad. All this combined into one movie results to one of the worst films I've ever seen. Stay away.",

            "content": "I wasn't sure what to expect from Seven Pounds, but I was told that Will Smith gave a great dramatic performance so I figured I shouldn't miss it.\n\nSeven Pounds is an example of how successful a film can be simply on how many viewers are willing to pay to see someone onscreen. In this case, it's Will Smith because the poster, trailer and name of the film Seven Pounds give no real insight into what the film is really about. It's all a mystery. And Seven Pounds is not a film that I could predict anything out of, because within the intro viewers bear witness to the darker side of Will Smith which is very rarely seen as he is more often a hero of some form or another. But in Seven Pounds the first thing he shows is a relentless aggression and almost passion for chastising a person for being blind. It's an intense emotional sight, and not at all what I expected from Seven Pounds, because while I didn't know what to expect I would never have predicted that America's prince Will Smith would be in the role of a person mocking a blind man. Seven Pounds works as a film which shows off the acting talents of Will Smith you may not have seen before, and that way it does immediately succeed in terms of casting. \nBut the mystery of Seven Pounds soon wears thin because the questions viewers ask don't get answered and then the film stops asking questions. It simply descends into being an ambiguously directed melodramatic story which soon turns into a romantic drama that is unpredictable in a no longer good way. It doesn't characterise its protagonist Tim Thomas at all because it tells nothing about him except the slight hint that he has some kind of trouble to him. And while the story deals with some hard hitting dramatic terriroty, it crams it into the film's climax and overloads the dramatic impact after such an extensive period of melodrama which renders it tonally inconsistent. And while the cinematography is nice and the musical score benefits the drama, the drama is really scattershot with the inconsistent pacing and so the whole experience isn't ever as good as it could have been.\nSeven Pounds is an ambitious drama at best, and some of its dramatics are powerful. But really it is misguided as a story and doesn't receive enough direction from Gabriele Muccino who fails to live up to the success of his previous collaboration with Will Smith, The Pursuit of Happiness.\nLuckily Seven Pounds benefits from a great cast.\nWill Smith gives an incredibly powerful lead performance in Seven Pounds. Though the unveiling of the mysterious story in Seven Pounds isn't too effective, his performance is because he ensures that there is constantly a dramatic movement in the story due to his effortful performance in which he displays a true tenacity over the mysterious and grim atmosphere of the story. His facial expressions use a little less tension than many of his other films, and through that minor change to his physicality it is proved that he can change the atmosphere of the story from intensely energetic to depressing through such a simple change, and from there his twice Academy Award nominated dramatic acting skills take over and show off just what he can do. And what he does is give a successful performance which cranks up the effect of Seven Pounds and makes Tim Thomas a character easy to care about or connect to. Will Smith characterises Tim Thomas more than writer Grant Nieporte could, and so he is a genial lead.\nRosario Dawson gives one of the best performances of her career in Seven Pounds, because her supporting performance shows that she shares a superior chemistry with Will Smith to the one they shared in the low quality Men in Black II and she also proves how simply she can construe her true talents as an actress. Her acting talent is largely rooted in her eyes, because where she looks and how she looks at it defines her mood and the height of her emotional subtext in sequences. She has a real power at creating a strong facial expression when the scene calls upon her to do kit, and luckjily her performance never descends into the melodramatic territory that much of the rest of the film ends up doing.\nBarry Pepper and Woody Harrelson provide strong presences and good supporting roles key to the story in their own little way as well in Seven Pounds.\n\nSo Seven Pounds is a well acted and unpredictable drama, but it doesn't seem any more predictable to the director who fails to give it any sort of consistency whatsoever.",

From the beginning of the movie, Smith's character plays God as he goes from person to person, judging who is worthy of redemption. We watch this happen again and again, with stereotypical reactions from mostly stereotypical characters. Smith's socially maladapted character (Ben Thomas) fails to create the intrigue that Muccino thinks he does. Muccino attempts to create mystery surrounding Ben Thomas; he actually designs a character with an intense need for psychotherapy and serious interpersonal issues. Muccino spends too much time focusing on Thomas' irritating inability to function as he tries to help others; so much so that by the time we learn why Smith is attempting to save others, our imaginations have created a greater plot than Muccino has directed. The film deserves some credit for attempting uniqueness and artistry, but overall the movie is a macaroni picture brought home by a child from school - the artist thinks the picture is fantastic but the rest of us are saying, \"What the heck is that?\" Rent it, don't buy it, and balance your checkbook while you watch it.",

This movie ranks worse on here than the movie \"finding nemo\" or star wars movies, yet we call this improbable and write it off?  It seems outlandish to me that we are basing reviews of a tale of fiction on their probability of being played out in real life.  \nThis is, by far... one of my favorite movies.  Yes, it's grim and yes the ending doesn't end with that cheery roses and we all go to a wedding feel.  Improbable, maybe, but the characters portray it so eloquently.  It is heart wrenching, and will likely make you cry.  It's a love story and a tale of destruction.  Classic romance/angst at it's finest.  I will watch this movie again and again for years to come because it exemplifies our struggle with emotions in hard situations and while it may be improbable, it's a beautifully written movie with amazing actors who portray each line to their fullest.  If you're looking for a happy ending though-- keep looking, because not all movies SHOULD end happily and these writers knew that.",

I have nothing bad to say about this movie that only point I would like to bring up is that i would have liked if one of the characters that Will decides to help the Child would have been given a bigger part in this movie. I felt he was left out somewhat. Otherwise it was a good movie Rosario Dawson was amazing.",

            "content": "The greatest asset this movie has is Will Smith's performance and a very mysterious plot. The first two thirds of it have a lot of bumpy moments and are quite frankly, boring in places. However, the film's tearjerking and emotionally resonant finale makes viewing the whole thing worthwhile. When you finally understand what actually what was going on during this entire movie, you can't help but realize why it was kept away from the audience until the end. You also at that moment realize what kind of movie this is and it will break you in this final twenty minutes. It's not necessarily a movie that will make you cry (although if you do, it is completely understandable), but it is one that will emotionally effect anyone. If it was executed better the film could have consistently entertained instead of becoming a bit of a drag in places. Nonetheless, the movie is a heartbreaker with a lot of thought put into it and for that it is worth at least one watch.",

Watching a self loathing Will Smith try to hold back tears as he goes about his final mission for an hour and a half got to be a bit much. Rosario Dawson is very good as the kinda girlfriend with the heart condition, Barry Pepper as the best friend is heartbreaking and Woody Harrelsons charcter although well acted was just confusing. I did like how this made little sense in the beginning though, with random characters, stories and brief flashbacks before it all comes together (others will probably hate this) but I like trying to figure things out. I found the end scene with the box jellfish in the bathtub very disturbing.02/13 (2)",

His efforts to put forth a man longing for redemption are recognized, and even the somewhat plainly-delivered plot and slow to build action do not negate so much that it becomes boring. Seven Pounds is a movie of personal sacrifice and spiritual reclamation that tugs on the heart-strings (pun intended) of the audience. The screenplay may not have been the most thrilling, but the premise still remains a strong concept in the modern world. The lesson here presents itself easily to viewers, which might result in too dull a manner for some, but I believe the movie gains merit in its cast and crew. Told a different way, by a different director I might have given this a higher rating, however, while the cast is great, there remain a few story blunders that limit the effect of the movie. I would recommend this movie, due to Smith's appeal and the premise/goal of this movie.",
