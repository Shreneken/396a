    "summary": "With too many wars and too few soldiers, a lab develops a virus that brings dead Marines back to life. When a test subject escapes, he heads to a strip club and infects dancer Jessy (Jennifer Holland), who becomes a zombie. The club's owner, Ian (Robert Englund), discovers that undead Jessy pulls in more money, and he encourages the other girls to get infected, including the popular Kat (Jenna Jameson). Kat and her friends go along with the plan -- but then they start killing the clients.",

It's genuinely funny here and there, and the strip element, so to speak (and remain tactful), is quite enjoyable in a pre-nut clarity sort of way (okay I think I just lost all semblance of tact..).  The characters are energetic and fun to follow, but many of them aren't exactly likeable, and the story itself really just takes the most obvious routes imaginable.  This is, for all intents and purposes, the soft-core scenes of an adult film (with zombies) in between the sex scenes, only with a greater budget; basically, this is a movie made up of the parts you normally fast-forward over, just given a lot more gloss.  But as a viewing, it's actually quite entertaining in a shallow and predictable way -- The energy is high, the women attractive, the gore sometimes grotesque and the jokes sometimes legitimately funny.",

I do know that I barely appreciate the living strippers, let alone the undead ones in this movie.  From a \"I like girls\" perspective, the more attractive ones are (mostly) the ones that weren't strippers which I feel was an intentional and odd choice.\n\nThe entire movie screams \"we don't take this seriously, and neither should you\", outside the strip club and in.  It also, at the same time, serves as some great metaphor for how awful humanity is all the up to, and potentially past death.  It feels very strange for a movie to be so badly shallow and deep at the same time.\n\nPutting aside the bad concept, and the horribly devised plan, there just isn't anything to like.  There might be just enough for a Bad Movie Night, but there is so little value in this watch, I can't imagine who seriously enjoys this one.",

It literally sucks. The plot and dialogues are a joke, the acting is bad and some of the zombies at the beginning of the film look ridicules. But what did I expect? The only positive thing there is to say is that there's lots of blood and gore. O yeah, and nudity. Not to say constant nudity. In the main cast we see horror icon Robert Englund (A Nightmare on Elmstreet) and porn star Jenna Jameson (who's making a career change... yeah right). A waste of time if you ask me, unless you're into dead women... \n\nWhen an elite military group needs to take care of a zombie problem in a secret laboratory, the rookie gets bitten in his hand. Knowing that his teammates will shoot him if they would find out, he flees and crawls through the basement window of a nearby building. Unknowingly he enters 'Rhino', an illegal strip club owned by Ian Essko (Englund). During the act of the club's star dancer Kat (Jameson), he changes into a zombie and attacks her. Essko and his employers hide Kat's body, but shortly afterwards see that she is back on stage, dancing like nothing ever happened. And with success! Essko smells that a lot of money can be earned with his zombie stripper. Soon, the other girls get jealous and want to turn too. That's when things go wrong...",

I have no illusions about the fact that this is low-budget, poorly made, inconsequential crap, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying it all to Hell.\n\nRobert Englund (above - Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, Hatchet, 2001 Maniacs, The Nightmare on Elm Street Series, Python, Urban Legend, Wishmaster) is fantastic as a mysophobic strip-club owner. He'll be very interesting to see in the not to vastly differently sounding upcoming film Strippers VS Werewolves.\n\nIt's chock full with enough nudity and fake blood to make a Satyr model blush, though as a genera rule the girls aren't strictly speaking attractive, you take what you can get in the name of good B-Movie entertainment. The film isn't entirely without intellect, it has a moral issue or two, as well as making a political statement and above all being loosely based/inspired on Eugene Ionesco's play Rhinoceros, so far as Englund's character being named Ian Essko, as well as alluding to philosophers Satre and Camus.\n\nZombie Strippers, with a tweak or two, could easily have hit the new wave of Grindhouse Revival alongside Bitch Slap, Hobo with a Shotgun, Hell Ride, Death Proof, Planet Terror and Machete. Alas it was not to be, but the film is still old-school entertainment. A movie best seen intoxicated on some level, but perfectly acceptable to laugh at while sober.\n\nThere's great dialogue sequences, and at least some vague semblance of a back story. Hiring porn-stars instead of actors was a sort of a double-edged sword, but the crew have no intention of holding back in the barrage of tits and hilarity. It's fucking sick, in both the Wutcunt and regular interpretation of the word.\n\n-Gimly",

Instead it's an awful film with a stupid script and a very poor cast. I mean Jenna Jameson stars in this, and she was porn star for a decade, so what do you expect? Robert England who's legendary role in the Nightmare on Elm Street seri8es has made him a legend in the genre, but with this film it's hard to believe that he would make crap like this, but he has. This is a horrible film that lacks direction and flare. The film is just too cheesy with bad acting to really make it interesting. This could have been good, but the problem lies with its cast that really can't act and despite its interesting idea for a film, it fails to go anywhere and ends up being not interesting. Zombie Strippers is a poor horror film, one that just doesn't have anything memorable or really fun for that matter. This may be a good idea for a horror film, but the result is definitely not impressive. Some comedy horror films succeed at being good, cheesy fun. However, Zombie Strippers fails because it lacks anything truly memorable. As a horror comedy, this one fails. If the film had a better cast, a better, more3 developed script, then I think that this film might have been good. But as it stands this is a mess of a film, one that just doesn't deliver what it sets out in trying to do. With this film there are a lot of boundaries trying to be pushed, but not enough effective horror comedic bits being shown to the viewer. This film just doesn't work. If you want a great horror comedy with loads of gore, watch John Gulager's Feast instead.",

I guess I have to write a review? oh pooh. \n\nAnyways, after that stimulating introduction to this review, I must admit it made me gag, mock it, and roll my eyes. Which is an accomplishment for any genre. How diverse! It's stupid in multiple ways! \n\nFirst thing: the political humor present at the beginning was short-lived (with no justification) and demonstrated personal bias on the part of the makers of the film, and was completely unrelated from the rest of the film. In fact, it seemed like the first section of the film was completely split and partitioned away from the rest of the film... it could easily have been two separate, but equally bad movies because the two halves were so unrelated. The opening was just a device to set zombie strippers in motion. The makers think that it comes full circle by reintroducing the squad at the end to contain the situation, but it really just reminds us that there was no reason to watch any of this in the first place. \n\nThe satire on the military procedures, scientist debauchery, and underground profiteering and greedy entrepreneurs all annoys me because it's such a simplistic and naive perspective. None of the characters are deep, all the actors are terrible, and most of the movie is just decaying corpses twirling on a metal pole and eating people. I mean... HOW WOULD THE PATRONS NOT NOTICE THAT THEIR FRIENDS WERE NEVER SEEN AGAIN? How could they explain that or justify them missing? That's only one of hundreds of plot holes and absurdities in this crap-fest. Honestly, if you want to see freaks dancing and eating people, watch sexy vampiress Salma Hayek dance with a snake and stick her foot into Quentin Tarentino's mouth in From Dusk Til Dawn. \n\nThe actresses... dancing... over and over... and competing... it's so boring, despite them being naked. And HOLY SHIT is that Jenna Jameson? Anyway, seeing her rot in front of me along with all the other zombie girls is by no means attractive. Neither is them eating tongues, shoving their places into the owner's face, or sticking balls in their places and shooting them out at each other. The disgusting nature of this movie troubles my weary mind and makes my hydrochloric acid - coated stomach churn with uneasiness. This is not in a positive manner. \n\nHere's a recommendation: don't waste your time with THIS movie. Pick up a DIFFERENT Jenna Jameson flick and enjoy. =P",

            "content": "In an alternate future, George W. Bush is still President and America is at war with two-thirds of the world. With public nudity more or less banned, strip club owner Ian Esko (Robert Englund) runs the hottest place to be. When his star stripper, Kat (Jenna James) is bitten by a zombie infected with a super soldier serum (stay with us on this...), he decides the show must go on, allowing Kat to continue to dance. Pumped up, violent and sexy, Kat becomes a hit, leaving the rest of Esko's troop of strippers disgruntled and jealous. One by one they open themselves up to temptation; allowing Kat to bite them and become one of the undead. When the strippers start taking more than tips from their punters, Esko is forced to start hiding the horrors that are happening in the Champagne Room.\n\nAnd yes, it's based on a play about conformity and Nazis from the 1950s.\n\nEnglund and Jameson are the most obvious examples of stunt casting, but this isn't something to hold against them. Okay, let's be honest. Meryl Streep has nothing to fear from Jameson in the acting stakes. However, whilst it's easy to dismiss her part as nothing more than boobs and bum, Jameson is clearly in on the whole joke and throws herself into the part of Queen Bitch with gusto. Englund is equally fun as Ian Esko; the mysophobic club owner who seems more concerned about catching herpes from his staff, than the apocalypse that's brewing around him.\n\nThere's a delicious humour that runs throughout Zombie Strippers. A lot of this, surprisingly, coming from the themes of individuality and mass movements. Jameson is fond of reading Nietzche, which she finds even more enjoyable now she's dead. Meanwhile, the only Christian stripper in the room, Jessy (Jennifer Holland), contemplates giving up her religion and soul, so she can raise money for her Grandma's medical bills, only to be called an 'existential bitch'.\n\nUnfortunately, none of this wallpapers over the large cracks that make Zombie Strippers almost, at times, barely watchable. Despite being less than two hours long, there is a lot of fat that can be trimmed up. For a film with strippers in the title, there is actually too much stripping. We don't need to see every single girl's routine to get an idea of who they are. That's what dialogue is for guys! Yes, yes, we sound like party poopers, but really, take out the stripping at the beginning and the film immediately becomes leaner and meaner.\n\nThere are also a few humour stillbirths and most these are in the form of Paco, a deliberately stereotypical Mexican who raises barely a titter. There's also the mercenaries who go under the banner of the Z-team. Despite having stopped the Apocalypse ('Lieutenant Ryker here killed Satan himself with a sharp stick. Good work soldier!'), they seem to suck the joy out of every scene they're in.\n\nFinally, with the numerous references to the Bush Administration, Zombie Strippers really wants to be a biting satire on the Gulf War, but it all comes across a bit gummy.\n\nZombie Strippers is an unapologetic mixture of gore, bad jokes and nudity. It's about as subtle as a slap with a tissue wrapped around a sledgehammer. At its very best, it's Peter Jackson's brilliantly demented Braindead. At it's very worst, it's Troma's mind-numbing Rabid Grannies. However, the bottom line is that even going in as cynical as you want, Zombie Strippers sneaks up on you and by the time, the blood hits the fan, you'll find yourself being willingly taken away. Definitely one for Friday nights with pizza, beer and a low set of standards.",

Porn doesn't make you a good actress/erotic dancer) but I doubt it. The movie consisted of mostly of gratuitous gore and nudity, but what were you really expecting from a movie with the title, \"Zombie Strippers?\" My personal opinion on the negative feedback, is that said critics, expected far too much going into this film. While I wouldn't necessarily call it \"campy\" - due mostly to the, \"stripper\" bit - I would definitely classify it as a good bad film. I don't understand how people can find films like, \"Hostel\" and \"Team America: World Police\" entertaining, but give this film such negative reviews. All in all, if you're looking for a morbidly entertaining low budget b-movie, this should be on the list with \"From Duck til Dawn,\" \"Machete,\" and \"Kill Bill.\" 3.5/5",

This is of course its intent, but it goes way over the top in what is sensible and tasteful even in a movie called 'Zombie Strippers'.\r\n\r\nThe title of the film definitely tells you all about the plot, as its pretty much just decaying, naked whores dancing around to crappy music. I would say the film is disgusting, but I don't know if that's a strong enough word. Just trying way too hard. The acting/script/direction is all exactly what you would think it to be, featuring XXX actresses with a sub-million dollar budget. The make up is decent, but nothing special.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it has a few amusing scenes, but even they are ridged and forced. I'll recommend it if your looking for something disgusting/intensely strange.",

The challenge is in sitting through through middle 40 minutes. The gore effects are a mix of make-up and CGI, the former executed better than the latter. As a footnote in the zombie genre, this one will likely stand out as the final appearance of \"porn star\" Jenna Jameson. The destruction of her character mirrors the real-life deconstruction of her media presence prior to motherhood. Director Lee left an opening for a sequel. Let's hope this is a stand-alone pop-culture reference and not the start of a series.",

For one, the military will develop a virus used to reanimate dead soldiers, meaning that once they are killed on the battlefield they can just get right back up and keep on fighting. Zombie soldiers essentially. Also in this future public nudity is highly illegal, meaning strip clubs and the like have to go underground. When a strain of this virus gets loose and ends up invading one of said underground strip joints . . . let's just say all hell breaks loose! The lead dancer, Kat, gets infected and soon after gives the best performance of her stripping career. After watching Kat the rest of the girls strangely find themselves wanting to be zombiefied, to be able to give the best performance of their careers too. One by one they succumb to Kat's bite and the owner of the strip club, Ian, seeing how the patrons are reacting to the zombie strippers, smells nothing but big profits! There is only one problem . . . the strippers keep eating their clientele! Will Ian's scheme backfire on him? You'll have to watch and see! This movie was amazing, to be quite honest. It was meant first and foremost as a comedy and a comedy it was, I was piss my pants laughing at certain points. This genre of movie where the acting can at times be surprisingly good but for the most part very bad, ditto for the special effects, is really starting to grow on me. A lot of people think movies like this are just plain stupid, and they are, but that's the whole fun of it. We like zombies, we like strippers. Put them together . . . brilliant! I was actually really impressed with Jenna Jameson's acting, I thought it was going to be all porn cheese, but she was actually one of the best. Same for Robert Englund, he was hilarious. I love how Jenna performed the ping pong ball trick at the end of the film with not only ping pong balls but pool balls as well! I loved the Warriors reference too. Great movie!",
