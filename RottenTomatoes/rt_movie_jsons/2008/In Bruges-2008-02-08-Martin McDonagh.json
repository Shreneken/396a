The movie isn't flashy - the color palette is grey, and it only has a few important characters. This put pressure on the actors, and they deliver \u2013 Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Fiennes are all phenomenal. This goes for both drama and comedy. The movie has a twisted sense of humor that I came to love. Even the funniest bits work because of the situations and the performances. It's great when you can make something that isn't funny to the characters funny to the audience. The setting is also well-utilized, and it gives the movie a very unique atmosphere.

On the surface, In Bruges a darkly funny buddy comedy, but underneath, it is a complex human drama filled with themes of redemption, life, and beauty. At parts you don't know if you should laugh or you should cry. The script is brought to life by its magnificent ensemble, including two Irish hitmen (Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson), their strict boss (Ralph Fiennes), a young drug dealer (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy), and a racist dwarf actor (Jordan Prentice). But the film is also illuminated by Bruges itself, that doesn't directly affect the plot, but does drive the characters' emotions in the plot. The film is a raunchy and violent black comedy that culminates into an ending that's as beautiful as the city itself. In Bruges may have launched McDonagh's successful career, but even after his more arthouse productions, In Bruges remains his most defining picture yet.",

            "content": "A glorious display of guilt, absurdity, and violence.\n\nDirector Martin McDonagh's Irish black comedy In Bruges (2008) is a dark masterpiece about two hitmen sent off to hide out in the middle of nowhere in Europe, in Bruges, Belgium of all places. McDonagh ensures In Bruges feels like a tender slow burn that bursts to life with sudden violence to ensure you're still laughing before shooting you through the heart with his earnest sentiment of comradery and honor among thieves. In Bruges is one of the greatest films I've ever seen.\n\nI love how McDonagh's direction has the insane tone of Trainspotting with a plot that slowly builds into Mean Streets alongside Mikey and Nicky. I also appreciate all the references to Don't Look Now. McDonagh directs quiet reflective scenes that quickly become silly, yet retain the poignant dramatic heart of In Bruges. I honestly think In Bruges is Martin McDonagh's best film, superior to even Seven Psychopaths. It rivals his brother John Michael McDonagh's The Guard or Calvary. In Bruges is written by Martin McDonagh with an absolutely hilarious and wickedly irreverent Irish sense of humor that tears apart all in these vicious men's paths. \n\nEditor Jon Gregory keeps a relaxing pace for a calming vibe while Brendan and Colin are in Bruges. I like how erratic and chaotic the pace fastens up towards the shootout finale. Gregory's sharp cuts are beautiful and perfectly timed for the Irish comedy that makes In Bruges' 108 minutes feel brisk and alive with spirit. Eigil Bryld's cinematography shoots Bruges, Belgium with a solemn quiet beauty for all his wide shots of this apparently ancient medieval city. I love the fast panning shots during the chase sequences, but it's all the pretty medium and close-up shots so carefully framed that gripped me the most during In Bruges. It's a gorgeously shot and moodily lit picture.\n\nIrish actor Colin Farrell is hysterical as Ray the incompetent and irritable hitman. His general disagreeability and inner turmoil is fascinating as Farrell portrays Ray with real heart and total spitefulness. Colin Farrell is pure chaos within In Bruges and he's a blast to watch. \n\nIrish actor Brendan Gleeson is very subtle and understated as assassin Ken Daley. He just wants to enjoy sightseeing around Bruges and Colin Farrell simply won't let him have a pleasant vacation in hiding in Bruges. Gleeson is sublime as he must try to relax, while also coming to terms with being assigned to kill off his close friend. It's a great depiction of morality among the immoral and criminal.\n\nEnglish actor Ralph Fiennes is funny and menacing as the furiously raging mob boss Harry Waters. His swearing and yelling are as hilarious as his sudden violence. Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Fiennes all could have earned Oscars for In Bruges. Irish actor Ciar\u00e1n Hinds gets a touching cameo as Priest, whom Colin goes to a confessional to over his woes.\n\nFrench actress Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy is breathtaking and endearing as Chlo\u00eb Villette. Her femme fatale is increasingly interesting and dangerous with a strangely alluring warmth to her. She's playful and heartbreaking in equal grace. Dutch actress Thekla Reuten is very beautiful and charming as the nice hotel co-owner Marie. She's very sweet and patient with Gleeson and Farrell. English actress Anna Madeley is very blunt and stunning as the Dutch prostitute Denise. English actress Elizabeth Berrington is quite nice as Ralph Fiennes' concerned wife Denise.\n\nCanadian actor Jordan Prentice is very funny and sympathetic as the little person actor Jimmy with his drug addictions, racist rants, and preference to be called a dwarf. Belgian actor J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier is excellent as the absurd skinhead robber henchman Eirik. I found Belgian character actor Eric Godon super funny as the deadpan gun provider Yuri in Bruges. Lastly, Slovenian actor \u017deljko Ivanek gets a hilarious cameo as the disgruntled Canadian Man.\n\nProduction designer Michael Carlin creates quaint hotel sets in Bruges and helps Belgium look less depressing. Chris Lowe and Tim Browning's art direction is really lovely with shafts of lights shining down on characters during daylight and the darkness of night enshrouding these characters in oppressive shadows. Anna Lynch-Robinson's set decoration gives the hotel room a sparse bit of furniture and the bars and diners a cozy feel. I liked seeing all the antiques in the historical part of Bruges.\n\nComposer Carter Burwell's ominous and ponderous score features dainty piano melodies and thudding percussion that gives In Bruges a poignant dramatic flair and fearsome darkness. He keeps things light for the comedy scenes, but also finds that heartfelt sincerity for the suspenseful dramatic scenes. Sound designers Nigel Heath, James Harrison, Julian Slater, and Oliver Brierley let you hear footsteps echo on cobblestone paths and gunshots ring out in the still of the air. The pristine sound design is clear for voices and bullets alike.\n\nCostume designers Jany Temime and Laurent Guinci provide long overcoats and stylish contemporary Irish and Belgish outfits for McDonagh's excellent ensemble. Sharon Martin gives the guys a gritty look, while Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy looks adorable and glamorous.\n\nIn conclusion, In Bruges is a killer crime thriller and a fiercely funny comedy that's sure to startle with Martin McDonagh's outrageous writing.",

Deliciously playful dialogue overflows from the screen as McDonagh delights in creating some very entertaining banter. He also knows how to pick his cast. Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Fiennes all deliver some of their best work ever here, playing funny, soulful, and complex criminals.

Further problems arise when their temperamental crime boss (Ralph Fiennes) arrives in town to mete out justice.  It's a film about the perceptions of honor and principle among the dishonorable and unprincipled, but, more than anything else, it's about relationships.  The dialogue is crisp and intelligent.  The characters, despite their shortcomings, are well-developed.  The locale is beautifully filmed. The story constantly evolves and never fails to entertain.

One of the best films since the turn of the century, Martin McDonagh's original, foul mouthed, violent and truly brilliant tale of two assassins sent to Bruges to await further instructions after a job gone wrong is a joy in every respect. An exceptional script is given the treatment it deserves by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, who are outstanding as the two assassins, helped along ably by one of the best Ralph Fiennes cameos you will ever see. Although In Bruges remains his best work to date, McDonagh's more recent work is also terrific, culminating in Oscar wins for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017).",

The movie is not quite original with its premise but the way it executes the story is quite clever and at times unpredictable. It is a rather simplistic dark comedy with an intriguing setup, focused plot and engaging banter. There is a whirlwind of tones constantly in shift as these well-defined characters act out impulsively so but it remains mostly grounded and witty. The cast is fairly game through-out with three outstanding performances. Colin Farrell has never been better as the na\u00efve, child-like Ray. Brenden Gleeson is masterfully gruff yet gentle as Ken and Ralph Fiennes elevates the flick further with the vulgar yet principled foil that is Harry. I can't say that I consistently laughed through-out and the ending, while intentionally bittersweet and ironic, didn't land with me but the film as a whole is a memorable and surprisingly moving journey about forgiveness, a few Irish c--ts and a racist dwarf. - 8/10 (B+)",

The biggest problem for me though was that some, not all but some of the themes and messages in the movie were a little two subtle, often to the point that they were hard to figure out while your trying to watch a movie, which is odd because my complaints of subtlety usually go the other way. But this movie borders the line between comedy and thriller really well with the Mcdonagh style first act is very comedic and then the tone darkens with the story's tension. And though there is some over-subtlety in the script, it doesn't really matter in the end because even without understanding that, you still have a really engaging story with great characters that you care about. Overall, not a masterpiece for me but a really good movie that I would recommend to anyone who hasn't seen it.",

Portraying more realistic than over-the-top violence, and humor in the form of witty dialogue, In Bruges is a poignant take on the life of a criminal. The humor is taken as more of a coping mechanism for bad choices than outright ignorance, and there is a surprising amount of touching moments, aided by the great performances by Farrell and Gleeson. The plot can seem to be a bit thin sometimes, but it is largely irrelevant to the overall premise and message of the story. In Bruges somehow becomes a great action-thriller and meaningful social commentary simultaneously and seamlessly.",

            "content": "This beautifully dark, satirical film is shocking, emotional, and simply hilarious. It follows two assassins, Ray, a brash rookie (Collin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson), a seasoned pro. When Ray botches his first murder, the two men escape from London to Bruges, Belgium. The city, as suggested in the title, is a very important aspect of the film. Director Martin McDonagh's camera lingers on the city and its people. The character's interactions with them only flesh out the city and the type of people who reside there  Bruges is the best preserved medieval city in the country, which plays as a clever juxtaposition to the fast paced, frantic story beats unfolding. It also plays as a sort of purgatory, in which the two assassins must wait for further judgement. McDonagh translates his strengths as a playwright to this film brilliantly. The directing never is too flashy, only cutting when it needs to. However, that does not mean there is no craft on display here. Unlike many other directors, especially young ones, it is commonplace to put the camera constantly in motion, trying to add the most impact to every shot. McDonagh understands that this is not always necessary. Most conversations play out in either two shots or over the shoulders. He understands when to use what shot and how each fits in with the story. Every shot contributes to the characterization and the story taking place, which is rare and refreshing. This simplistic approach to visual storytelling helps shift the focus from the directing to the writing, where McDonagh's theatre background really shines through. The two character's conversations reveal an astonishing amount about themselves and their psychologies. You will never find a more funny take on child murder and suicide than here. That does not mean it is insensitive, which it is not. There is as much empathy as there is humor. McDonagh clearly loves the characters he has created, slowing down, allowing us to understand them, so their actions never seem comprised. Even when they murder or try to commit suicide, you understand their motivations and their goals. This does not mean the film is without faults. For instance, it feels like the third act shifts in tone. Like many before it, the third act forgets to be a comedy to arrive at an emotional payoff. It becomes a generic action movie, and I find myself far less engaged. Also, the music is noticeably lacking. It has a lovely theme that plays throughout. However, its placement is odd. I couldn't quite figure out how it acts as a leitmotif, what ideas it is trying to represent. Other than this, there is very little music in the film, which seems like a missed opportunity. However, it's great philosophical themes and dark humor make up for any trip ups it makes. McDonagh is just beginning, and I personally can't wait for whatever he does next.",

            "content": "I was fortunate to see this before Martin McDonagh's huge success with Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) and I enjoyed it as a well written and acted little black comedy. It's nice to see Colin Farrell's talents be used in service of a good screenplay and Brendan Gleeson employs his usual shtick to elicit laughter. When Ralph Fiennes shows up things got really exciting and seeing him combine Amon Goeth from Schindler's List (1993) and M. Gustave from The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) was delightful. The film doesn't have much more than that to offer but it's an improvement on his short film Six Shooter (2004) and a sign of great things to come.\n\nCriminal partners Ray, Colin Farrell, who is young and inexperienced and who accidentally shot a boy on a previous mission and the hardened but compassionate Ken, Brendan Gleeson, are stationed in the small town of Bruges. Ray absolutely hates the town despite developing a relationship with local drug dealer Chloe, Clemence Poesy, while Ken is rather charmed by the idyllic setting. The two befriend a local dwarf and engage in entertaining hi-jinks as the assassination of Ray by crime boss Harry Waters, Ralph Fiennes, looms. \n\nThe film's screenplay deserved the accolades that it was nominated for because it's really the center of this film. The darkly witty moments in which we discover Chloe's ex-boyfriend may have coordinated an attack on Ray with her help and Harry's murder of a dwarf and subsequent guilt were enjoyable. The interplay between Farrell and Gleeson is joyous as Farrell plays the grumpy man-child and Gleeson plays the giddy older man to perfection. The screenplay adds emotional moments too but unlike in certain comedies, City Slickers (1991) for example, it doesn't feel mawkish or cloying when these shifts are made. I felt something for these characters by the end of the film and that was largely due to the deft, well-handled characterization found in McDonagh's screenplay.\n\nFiennes give the performance that deserves the most attention as he commands the screen with his intimidating presence but also plays on the comedic persona he would go on to strengthen. You understand that he takes his job very seriously and one of the most hilarious moments in the film is derived from him making a fatal decision based on one of his moral rules that ultimately turns out to help our heroes.\n\nThe cinematography should also be noted as the town of Bruges in northern Belgium, which I and I expect most other people where previously unaware of, was captured with stunning vivacity. It felt like a gritty, platonic Before Sunrise (1995) as we mainly focus on the dialogue and character development but come to appreciate the scenery as they familiarize themselves with local landmarks. The town is never made out to be something more than it is but we grow to love it as does Ray and appreciate the quaint little buildings and beautiful light in the afternoon. This can often be underappreciated in a film as people look at the acting or the way in which the film is shot instead of just taking in the experience and I felt that McDonagh paying attention to smaller details such as this enhanced the effect of the film.\n\nIf you want a great dark comedy I would recommend Withnail and I (1987) and To Die For (1995) because they reach heights that this film doesn't even aim for in terms of acrid humor. I laughed enough and was pleasantly surprised by the shock of Fiennes appearing, I knew so little going in, but I wouldn't call it one of my favorites and it probably would not come to mind if I was asked to recommend comedies. Another Farrell film, The Lobster (2015), achieves the balance between comedy, dark drama and romance far better and contains moments of such dread and elicits such uncomfortable laughter that you are constantly on your toes, as you should be. Were In Bruges to contain more of the moments of horror that are so deliciously nasty in Yorgos Lanthimos' work I would have appreciated it even more than I already did but alas it's just a very good black comedy.",

Ralph Fiennes' insanity is terrifying, hilarious and touching all at the same time. His late appearance as Harry helps the movie keep its momentum until the end, which is shocking yet fulfilling. Ken's (Gleeson) reserved and contemplative posistion in the film comes to a heartbreaking and shockingly creative climax in the final scenes. Ray (Farrell) views a world of crime and immorality through a profoundly innocent lens, the movie is essentially about a child killing another child.

You really get the sense from Tarantino, though, that he at least *likes* the groups whose language he might offend - I don't get that from Martin McDonagh. It really just seems to be three straight white men doing things like asking midgets if they want to kill themselves because they're a midget.\nThe characters are very well fleshed out; good thing, because there's so much dialogue and so few actual characters. This makes the eventual climax legitimately pulse pounding and ultimately (mostly satisfying). Like I said, though, this movie is liable to turn a lot of people off with its misogynistic, racist, bigoted language, but if you're able to look past that, you will find a strong film.",

Bruges is a preserved medieval city in Belgium that's Gothic architecture and art shows the turmoil of heaven and hell on Earth.  Ken and Ray's personal histories are revealed, and we see how and why they ended up where they are.  Bruges' buildings, streets and waterways, and alcoves (don't forget the alcoves), are used effectively, showing us different parts of the town as the story progresses.  The characters travel through different parts of the city as it shifts from exhibition and majestic through architecture to present and modern through the people, both residents and transients.  City sites change as the characters' perceptions shifts from the prosaic to the artfully mythic.  Several characters intersect Ken and Ray's story providing intertwining subplots, including a third act shift, until the entire plot is straightened out in the end.   \nThe sparse comedy is sardonic, acerbic, and dark, which lets the characters be humorously insulting, though that may be an endearing Irish sentiment from an Irish director.

Outstanding performances from everybody involved, particularly Ralph Fiennes who gives his most unconventional (and best) to date are part of the reason this film works as well as it does; but it would be nothing without the truly stunning script by Writer/Director Martin McDonagh that provides for tear-jerks and belly laughs all at once.

He's matched wonderfully by Bendan Gleeson, who genuinely believes in Ray, despite his past, while Ralph Fiennes is hilarious as their short-tempered mob boss.  Behind the camera, writer/director Martin McDonagh crafts a truly original piece and you'll never sure where it's going.  What's remarkable is that the dramatic moments are gut-wrenching (Ray did do a bad thing) while the comedic moments hilarious (an argument over a suicidal man with his supposed assassin over who gets to kill him is brilliant).  Best of all, they fit together in the film perfectly and never feel out of place with each other. McDonagh also makes great use of the the Christmas holiday, as some pretty horrible stuff happens around the time humans should be sharing peace & joy.

What a brilliantly hilarious film! I was genuinely taken aback at how much I laughed while watching this movie. It is a dark comedy, because there is some serious stuff going on throughout the film, but somehow that just made the humorous lines even funnier. The genius really comes in the way that these dangerous assassins go about life and talk about the serious things that come with their job in such a casual way. It also helps to add poignancy when one of them gets genuinely emotional when he talks about a particular event that happened while on the job. This adds gravitas to that event, so that we know even in their world this is a big deal. Colin Farrell is ridiculously charming and funny in the lead role, which is impressive because his character lacks a filter, so he could be seen as a total jerk. Brendan Gleeson is perfection as the best friend that everyone would love to have. Every moment he's on film I just want to relax and have a drink with him. Added to all this is the amazing Ralph Fiennes who is playing a character that is comedy gold, nearly every other word out of his mouth had me laughing out loud. I recognize that In Bruges has a very particular kind of humor (and some very serious things going on as well) so it won't appeal to all audiences. My recommendation would be to try watching it and if you don't find the first few scenes humorous, then just give up because it's not going to get better for you.

In the midst of this Farrell ends up liking and going on a date with Poesy while Fiennes has decided that Farrell needs to go and orders Gleeson to handle it. A little bit of a mind**** and i totally hated Farrell's character just because the irish accent he was using sounded too much like a leprechaun and i just couldnt take it seriously as well as his character being a total *****.

If you're In Bruges, then the boredom alone might get you. While I think it would be a beautiful city to explore, Colin Farrell disagrees. He has to wait there with fellow assassin Brendan Gleesan and he'd much rather be anywhere else. Colin will soon discover that he's about to become a notable member of the community, but not for a reason that he wants. Not at all...\n\nBefore watching this film, I was told it would be a comedy. There were certainly many humorous scenes but this was all about the story. Whether our cast was exploring, contemplating the life of their favorite midget, going on a date or \"doing a job,\" there was always some notable event to speak of. There was never a dull moment as when we weren't laughing, we were either on the edge of our seat or sitting in disbelief. The plot of In Bruges was very old fashioned in some ways which will make it refreshing for a modern audience. They really don't make movies like this anymore.\n\nWas In Bruges everything I wanted it to be? No, but that's actually not a bad thing. In many ways it exceeded my expectations and not just those that I had before the movie started. My first expectations after the opening few scenes were that In Bruges would stick with a cliche irritating odd-couple vibe. I was so wrong and I'm very glad that I was. In Bruges did have a few flaws with some characters and their choices but nothing I can get into in this sort of review. This film had been recommended to me for some time and I'm glad I finally took the plunge. If you're in the mood for comedy, action or a great story, In Bruges will keep you entertained.",

That's all I'm saying. \nThe script is magnificent. the acting is superb. the score is beautiful. the ending is ambiguous poetry. the direction is great. I have no flaws with this brilliant film. it blends comedy, drama, and brutal violence in such a way to where it flows perfectly and is never cluttered or dull. Great movie. My absolute favorite Collin Ferrel movie. the next is Seven Psychopaths. 5/5 stars. brilliant. a must see for everyone.",

            "content": "When I first viewed this film I had remembered the cover of the DVD which my brother owned, and I thought it would be a simple B-grade action film. I am so glad I was wrong because In Bruges is a true gem which delves into the motifs of guilt and hell/purgatory.\n\nWith the two main characters we have opposite sides of the personality - this has been said by McDonagh himself. There was a side of him which loved to sight-see (Ken) and the side that just wanted to have fun (Ray). From this we get a very cultured hit man as well as a moody young man itching to get the most out of life (drinking, meeting women, exploring).\n\nWhile I love Ray for his internal struggles, he is somewhat of a hard man to like; he is brutally honest, asks people whether they would kill themselves because of certain traits, and he calls people gay or retarded. But something has happened before the start of the story that makes him question his morality in the middle of the film and whether or not he should be punished for it.\n\nThis film seems somewhat influenced by Tarantino - at least for the dialogue aspect. It is not plot-based; it touches on pop culture references and includes lingo that make the characters seem more realistic or interesting than just characters. However, the problem is that it seems to try too hard at this.\n\nHowever, there are a good amount of funny conversations or situations in which the characters find themselves. Think Tarantino's dialogue meets an even darker humor, like the humor of the Coen brothers.\n\nOne plausibility factor I cannot stand, however, is that one character simply refuses to die. To avoid spoilers, I will just say he/she lives way longer than they should have, but this needs to happen to help the plot very late in the film.\n\nThe thing I love so much about this film is the ending monologue given by Ray (Colin Farrell's character), and the ambiguity behind what has happened to the character and whether this story should be considered a dark fantasy or a horrible reality. It is very enjoyable, and the themes are amazing!",

Brendan Gleeson always tries to look at things positively and he is met with Colin Farrell's amazingly negative (and funny) responses. The beginning of the film is a tad slow, but once it picks up it grabs you and never lets you go. I was surprised by how much I actually ended up liking it.

The absolute greatest quality of this movie is its masterful mixture of dark and deep seriousness with thought-provoking, witty humor. Combining real and sincere meaning with lightheartedness is not easy to pull off, but by centering the plot around some profound ideas, the movie becomes a powerful synthesis of these opposing concepts.\nThe film is also quite poetic and thematic without being pretentious or convoluted. The humor does not distract from the serious aspects of the movie, and it does not merely serve as comic relief. Rather, it cleverly focuses the audience's attention on the main messages of the movie. The plot itself is interesting enough for a great movie. Although it gets just a bit improbable in the end, the story is interesting and smart enough to make up for this slight stretch of reality. \nOverall, the wonderful performances by Gleeson and Farrell, the engrossing story, and witty dark humor made this one of those great movies that left me breathless at the end--both because I was deeply captivated and because I had laughed so much.",

Bruges is a purgatory for Farrell's character Ray after he committed an unspeakable, accidental crime, while it is a vacation for his partner Ken. When the boss gives Ken the actual purpose of their visit, it becomes a bloodbath. I can't recommend this film highly enough, Mcdonagh got robbed for the Best Screenplay Oscar. Also check out McDonagh's other work, which includes Academy Award winner short film Six Shooter, and the more light hearted film Seven Psychopaths. He is famous as a playwright, and many of his play scripts are available online as well.

            "content": "Winning Colin Farrell a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, In Bruges sounded like a worthwhile film to see.\n\nIn Bruges is a simple film. Its premise doesn't have too much to do or too many places to go, and so the focus of its importance rests on the skills of its screenplay and the talents of its cast.\nFor a black comedy, I didn't find In Bruges to be all that funny. I felt as if the film was a drama at heart and had a few comedic themes as well as some decent funny moments in the script, but as a whole there sikmply was not enough for me to really consider it to be a comedy as a whole. The balance between crime and black comedy isn't as successful as in director and writer Martin McDonagh's second feature Seven Psychopaths. While In Bruges may be a little bit more focused due to a smaller quantity of characters and features an even greater performance from Colin Farrell, it still doesn't find the same balance between comedy and crime that Seven Psychopaths was able to. I will admit that there were a few times when I laughed, but I hoped to laugh more and found that In Bruges simply wasn't as funny as it could have been.\nAnd also, although this didn't really bother me all that much, In Bruges felt more like a play than a film. I can understand it because Martin McDonagh is a popular Irish playwright, but for In Bruges it doesn't necessarily feel like he went to the distances to actually go into writing something of a different style. Due to maintaining the importance of its script and characters within the simple confines of its few locations, In Bruges doesn't seem to feel too much like a film. It is definitely an entertaining feature, but it didn't feel like it broke the ground of constantly feeling like a play and instead maintained the same feeling from start to finish without many surprises despite a $15 million budget.\nBut remaining within its constraints, Martin McDonagh manages to allow the cinematography to be the best it can and keep the intense mood of situations captured well as it ties into the atmosphere, and it captures the nice sights of the scenery in In Bruges all very well. So his direction is stylish enough, but above all the best thing he contributes to In Bruges is its screenplay. Writing in a fairly simple concept which he takes full advantage of as director, Martin McDonagh creates an impressive screenplay for In Bruges to benefit from due to the fact that it pitches dialogue which feels real and creates strong characters who talk about concept that make their mark as interesting. The screenplay constantly keeps In Bruges interesting and looks into the thoughts and feelings of its characters easily and well enough. Like many of his play scripts, Martin McDonagh manages to put all the focus on In Bruges where it most importantly lies which is in the area of the characters and the interesting things they have to say and discuss to and with each other, and it allows In Bruges to naturally develop into a strong and compelling feature which gives the cast a lot of strong material to work with.\nThe musical score is pretty intense in In Bruges because it keeps the feeling of the scenes consistently rich with intensity. The musical score has a memorable beat to it and helps the atmosphere of the film develop well over the course of its 107 minute running time.\nThe main thing that I found to be entertaining about In Bruges was the performance of Colin Farrell. Despite being an actor that has worked consistently in Hollywood for many years and articulating his voice well enough to disguise the fact that he is Irish, he takes a step back for In Bruges and lets both his natural voice and his best dramatic acting talents flourish. In one of the best performances of his career, Colin Farrell lets out all of the dramatic skills within him for the sake of Martin McDonagh's film, and the result is very effective because the fierce emotional intensity in Colin Farrell's performance makes him a perfect lead. Me manages to tenaciously grip the dramatic and character focused elements of the character Ray and he sinks into the dramatic depth of the lead with natural ease. In Bruges features Colin Farrell's most honest performance in years and it is one not held back by the commercialisation of big budget filmmaking but instead keeps its focus on the small scale material of Martin McDonagh's Academy Award nominated screenplay, and it proves to be just the right kind of material for him to be working with.\nBrendan Gleeson gives an effective supporting performance as well. Although he is known for a lot of performances which require a lot from him as a character actor, In Bruges simply demands his talents as a good actor which he doesn't fail to use. His tense and sharp line delivery in In Bruges becomes the source of an admirable performance and a strong chemistry which he shares with Colin Farrell. Brendan Gleeson consistently gives an effective supporting performance in In Bruges, and it helps the story move along well and develop naturally into being a compelling feature easily.\nRalph Fiennes supporting performance was a good one as well, and he manages to give a certain sophisticated rough edge to the dramatic nature of In Bruges which it serves to benefit from.\n\nSo while In Bruges isn't really as funny as you might hope and features a fairly basic story, it is well written and excellently acted well enough for it to be able to transcend most of the flaws that viewers may find in it, and the final product ends up being an intelligent and thrilling experience with Colin Farrell giving a powerful lead performance.",

Even minor encounters with tourists or citizens just make you either die of laughter or cry your eyes out.  Quotable line after quotable line, this movie has so many of those.  Colin Farrell puts on one of his best performances as an actor.  He portrays many different emotions as a troubled man with a shady past, something that is hard to do as an actor.  He can laugh, he can cry, he can fight, he can do it all basically.  As good as Colin was, however, by far the best actor in this movie was by Brendan Gleeson.  His character was so funny, loyal, and so greatly-played that during every line he uttered you were filled with joy, during his comical scenes.  His emotional scenes, however, were a different story.  His comical scenes were great, but his emotional scenes were even better.  I'm not embarrassed to say that this is one of the best performances put on of all time.  The soundtrack is perfect.  Nothing more can be said.  The cinematography is incredible.  There were many beautiful shots of Bruges, Belgium, as well as the characters.  The action was great, as well, perfectly coinciding with the humorous outputs.

I understand that this is a movie for some people to love, it's just not exactly my cup of tea. \n5 out of 10",

            "content": "\"In Bruges\" is crass, gory, but surprisingly entertaining.  I'm pretty sure that the opening dialogue of the film contains more swear words than non-swear words but something in me decided to give it a chance.  The synopsis led me to believe that this was an action film and my false expectation could be the source of my disappointment.  Black comedies are not really my thing and I probably would have passed on this one had I done my research.  Viewing it as a serious film, the language and graphic violence are completely over the top and often unnecessary, but this film is anything but serious.  Even though I approached the film from the wrong perspective, I can still accurately comment on the acting.  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleason have great chemistry and deliver the script well, but Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy kind of killed the momentum of the film.  Her character (and her performance) were bland, disinteresting, and distracted from the good performances of the other actors.  As far as its Oscar-nominated screenplay, it is difficult to discern where the nomination came from.  The story and twists were clever but the dialogue itself was rather trite.  It wasn't a bad script, but certainly not deserving of an Oscar nomination.  I don't recommend this film if you are not a fan of black comedies but, if it is your cup of tea, perhaps you will spot the genius that is eluding me.",

Now, these are two different films, but they do have some similarities. They both mix drama and comedy and both become very violent. Now, where \"Seven Psychopaths\" went a little too broad, \"In Bruges\" uses comedy very effectively. It is intertwined with the drama perfectly. You're never taken out of the film when you change from dramatic to comedic or vice versa. One reason it works is because of the acting. Colin Farrell delivers one of his best performances I've seen. You really get to care about him and understand him. He delivers the comedic and dramatic very well. You believe his character and motivations. He also has great chemistry with Brendan Gleeson, and that's what drives the film. Most of the film involves them talking, so if they didn't work together, the film wouldn't work. Another thing that helps the film is the directing. The film looks very good. It's shot very well and is pleasing. There is also a very nice tone added by the directing. It's bright and breezy, for the most part. The film is also edited very well. Nothing is cut soon, and no shot lasts too long. This is one talented director. He is also one talented writer. As I said earlier, the comedy and drama are pitch perfect. They intermix so fluidly. The plot is also quite good. It never gets complicated, but is also never childish. The way it is written is fantastic. While \"Seven Psychopaths\" went a little to wink-wink with it's writing, this one feels natural. Things are set up earlier than they happen, but when they are set up, it doesn't feel like something's being set up. Nothing ever felt forced. I was surprised by how well written it was. This was a film I didn't expect to like this much. I expected to like it, but not love it. This isn't a film for you Michael Bay action lovers. This isn't a film here to entertain through action. This is a film here to entertain by great writing and characters. This is a film you must see if you like good writing and performances. I give it an A-",

            "content": "A tone of dark comedy is incredibly difficult to successfully realize on film, or any medium for that matter. Typically involving a nearly alchemical combination of atmosphere, realistic, nuanced characterizations, and ironic (often macabre, or bizarre) dialogue and situations, unsuccessful iterations can end up in the realm of self-parody, or sickening gratuity. That being said In Bruges walks this veritable tight rope with the grace of an English gentlemen (or perhaps a hit-man masquerading as one).\nThis comedy/thriller follows the exploits of two criminals Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) fresh off a job gone wrong as they hide out in Bruges, Belgium awaiting \"the bosses\" call. Ray is a young, hot-headed philistine who can't wait to leave Bruges and return to London. Ken is an aged veteran of the business who at this point in his life seems interested in enjoying the finer things(as much as any career criminal has the ability to). The juxtaposition of hardened criminals and a town of sleepy Medieval tourist attractions creates an interesting fish-out-of-water element that the helps drive the story. In fact, the town of Bruges becomes a character itself as Ray and Ken circle it's landmarks throughout the story, returning to previously visited places at critical moments. In addition, the choice of Bruges as the story's primary location, creates a sense of small-town claustrophobia which adds focus to the proceedings.\n\n            The film benefits from the odd-couple relationship between the two main characters, and their respective views on Belgian culture and culture in general create a quite funny, but wisely underplayed comedic rhythm. The keenly observed nuances, and non-sequiturs in the film's dialogue generate some of the film's funniest moments as subtle behaviors and affectations are placed under a magnifying glass with great comic effect. One would expect writing of this caliber from respected Irish playwright Martin Mcdonagh(his play the Pillowman contains hints of this film's idiosyncratic nature), but unlike some films written and directed by playwrights this feature doesn't suffer from an overly \"stagey\" feel. There are some well-placed visual flourishes throughout, especially during the closing sequence. The action sequences are deftly handled giving the film a sense of reality that allows the both the comedy and drama to have more impact.\n\n            The acting is excellent, with Collin Farrell really showing his range of abilities in a role that requires complete dedication to both the dramatic and comedic moments. It probably helps too that he's speaking in his natural Irish dialect giving him a greater ability to focus on his performance, although with dialogue this sharp it would take a concerted effort on his part to derail the project. The dependably superb Brendan Gleeson lives up to his reputation here, providing a lifeline of empathy throughout a sometimes grim cast of characters. His resolute but human expressions and weighted, burdened performance assist in spurring this film to greater heights, and also greater accessibility. \n            \n            However, Ralph Fiennes in a turn as the short-tempered crime boss definitely steals the show with his appearance. He attacks lines of vicious dialogue with a frenetic glee that is a force to behold. American audiences might be surprised he has more to offer the world than his roles in Schindler's List and Harry Potter. I won't spoil the details of his arc, but suffice it to say that I guess there is honor amongst thieves.  The roles of the supporting characters are also well-acted if perhaps slightly underdeveloped(although we get a stark insight into dwarf racial relations). The women, while definitely not given a significant chunk of screen time, each have more than one dimension to their respective characters, and that's something of an achievement in a film with so much testosterone running through it.\n\n            The plot isn't the most complex thing out there, nor does it try to be, but it never loses it's way in this menagerie of slightly odd characters; and it has more than enough twists and turns to keep the viewer engaged in the main players and their plight. The trailer completely misrepresents this film as a rather generic 90's style action thriller, a marketing decision I'm sure, made in an attempt to reach that untapped goldmine of a market: teenage boys. Those looking for something along those lines might not be disappointed, as there are enough thriller/action elements in it to keep them distracted; but this film has much more going for it than that if open up to it, and let yourself fall into it's loping, absurdist rhythm.",

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN DRIVE SEAL*\n\n\nPlaywright McDonaugh's debut feature, In Bruges, works only up to a point as a crime comedy (however considering up to what point is quite remarkable), featuring a supporting cast ranging from quirky Euro-trash and plain old jolly eccentrics. But as a moral drama, it's almost as top of the pops one could ask for. The trailer didn't make it seem as such, then again it is hard to express the kind of conundrum that the main characters get themselves into while also appealing to a base of fans that love quip-type one liners (i.e. \"You're a bunch of bleeping elephants!\" or \"If I was retarded, or grew up on a farm, Bruges would impress me, but I didn't, so I'm not impressed.\") \n\nWhen In Bruges is at its best- and until its self-consciously symbolic touches in the last five minutes it usually is at its \"Best\" whatever that means- it expresses what I love seeing in films about career criminals: the total inner turmoil of what was done coming back to haunt the person. If it's true that no good deed goes unpunished, the same would probably go for bad deeds in the world of In Bruges, where the atmosphere of the practically medieval city is, the character Ken observes, like \"a fairytale\", and a sharp contrast to the dark side pervading Ken, Ray, and Harry.\n\nThe basic thrust of the plot is that Ray (half wise-ass womanizer and half half-suicidal played by Farrell) did a job back in London, a murder, which went horribly wrong in just one misstep (I won't reveal it here, though I should, except to say that it's one of those cardinal rules career criminals/hit men have to stick to), and so he and the older, less cynical Ken (Gleeson, who seems to be one of the most honest looking types in the character actor world, a spot-on casting choice), are sent to Bruges to receive more instructions. But those instructions, sent by the easily angered Harry (Ralph Fiennes, doing almost a hilarious imitation of Kingskey in Sexy Beast), aren't followed through, and then some manner of chaos ensues.\n\nHere and there McDonaugh takes what appears to be a lackadaisical attitude to the characters in this otherwise tense and uncertain fatalistic situation, as if an odd-matched comic duo are in a place one likes and one only can stand for mocking midgets (scuse me, dwarfs) in movie-making and hitting on the one hot girl in all of Bruges. But it's such a strange form that McDonaugh is working with here, with its mix of tones that it suddenly feels, in the context of the slightly bizarre and chilling circumstances, truthful. It goes without saying the cast helps give the material a boost, and that McDonaugh doesn't throw too many out-of-left-field curve balls with the plot. If he does, it's not of the sort we know we're usually hitting in this kind of crime story loaded with gallows humor and Catholic redemption mini-saga.\n\nIn short, if I were a bloke in Britain or a fella in Dublin, or a dupe in Bruges, as a writer this is the kind of stuff I'd immediately try to go for. It's smart, serious, mature genre work that relies on just enough blood-shed and violence and trauma to haunt its audience proper, and do its duty to supply another batch of wonderfully off-kilter 'comedy' scenes for fans of British gangster flicks. That this is nowhere near as shallow as a Ritchie pic goes without saying.",

After a messy hit in London, Ray and Ken are forced to go lay low in Bruges, Belgium, as they nervously wait to hear from their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes). Whilst in Bruges, Ray is struggling to deal with the guilt of what happened in London, yet still having enough time to comment on the state of the architecture, the tourists and a particular dwarf.\n\nIn Bruges is an interesting take on the life of a hitman, with much of the film consumed with these two burly guys trolling aimlessly around Bruges. The city becomes a running joke throughout the film, with both men frustrated with the lack of information from back home and being stuck with each other for a prolonged period of time. Colin Farrell is back to something of his best as he portrays a man consumed with paranoia and frustration, giving a highly believable performance. Brendan Gleeson is also on good form as the interplay between the two lead actors creates moments of great comedy.\n\nWhat makes this film more than just great acting performances is the great script. Martin McDonagh produces dialogue worthy of Tarantino in this quick and snappy comedy-drama. He creates comedy that looks so easy with his main characters spending much of the film simply walking around Bruges.\n\nAn hugely entertaining comedy but strongly based in its dialogue.\n\nJ.Henderson\n\n7.5/10.",

Finness plays a haunting off the handle  mad man that does an excellent job at getting his feeling across. The tension between Finness and Gleason is done perfectly.

Whilst in Bruges, Ray is struggling to deal with the guilt of what happened in London, yet still having enough time to comment on the state of the architecture, the tourists and a particular dwarf.\n\nIn Bruges is an interesting take on the life of a hitman, with much of the film consumed with these two burly guys trolling aimlessly around Bruges. The city becomes a running joke throughout the film, with both men frustrated with the lack of information from back home and being stuck with each other for a prolonged period of time. Colin Farrell is back to something of his best as he portrays a man consumed with paranoia and frustration, giving a highly believable performance. Brendan Gleeson is also on good form as the interplay between the two lead actors creates moments of great comedy.\n\nWhat makes this film more than just great acting performances is the great script. Martin McDonagh produces dialogue worthy of Tarantino in this quick and snappy comedy-drama. He creates comedy that looks so easy with his main characters spending much of the film simply walking around Bruges.\n\nAn hugely entertaining comedy but strongly based in its dialogue.\n\nJ.Henderson\n\n7.5/10.",

Well, those days are over, the guy has talent, it just wasn't fully utilized til now. I think I feel the same way bout him as I do bout Nick Cage. Anyways, about the movie. This is a slow burn crime drama, complete with dark comedy, depression, and tense and emotional scenes. It's also the feature debut for director/writer Martin McDonagh. This guy is gonna go places, fast. Well, maybe not fast, might not see his next movie surface til 2016 haha, he's slow but awesome. Farrell plays opposite Brendan Gleeson. Gleeson needs to start taking more lead roles rather than supporting, cuz he's brilliant. (Most of you know him as Mad Eye Moody from 'arry Potter, but he's also had mini roles in Braveheart, 28 Days Later, Troy, A.I., and Gangs Of New York.) Don't worry, I won't give anything away: two hit men have to hide out in Bruges, Belgium. That's it. O, and their boss is Ralph Fiennes and he plays Harry. Yes, Voldemort is Harry *explodes mind*. Besides this being just plain cool, it's also riddled with a great score and some artsy camerawork. And did I mention it takes place 'in fuggin Bruges!' Hmm, I could've sworn I did. All that being said, it's a flawless, low budget sleeper hit. Now on to McDonagh's new one, 7 Psychopaths!",

            "content": "THIS IS A MASTERPIECE.\r\n\r\nThe two greatest cult films of all time (in my opinion) are The Big Lebowski and this, In Bruges, an incredibly well-acted, ingeniously plotted, and fantastically written film that I cannot fucking recommend enough. It is spellbinding. But I'm on a rant right now, so let's go through this tour de force of film step by step.\r\n\r\nIn Bruges is the story of a hitman named Ray (Colin Farrell) who, while carrying out his first hit, accidentally shoots a little boy in the head. His boss Harry (Ralph Feinnes) sends him to the quaint little fairytale town of Bruges (it's in Belgium) with Ken (Brendan Gleeson), a fellow hitman. This simple and elegant premise lays the groundwork for the best and most realistic dialogue ever put on film, and I mean that literally-- Everyone acts just how you would expect them to in this film.\r\n\r\nFirst we have Ray, played to the fucking HILT by Farrell, whose complex persona totally makes the film. \"I killed a little boy, Ken!\" This one accident makes it clear to him that he really isn't cut out to be a hitman, and he goes into a downward spiral of tourist-punching, cocaine-snorting, and eventually suicidal despair. It's an amazing thing to watch. Farrell's facial expressions are utterly befitting to the character. I still have no idea how he does that thing with his eyebrows. \r\n\r\nThen we have Ken, who is just as complex as Ray, but doesn't happen to have a suicidal pall hanging over him. After arriving in Bruges (SPOILER ALERT), he is told by Harry to kill Ray, and is about to go through with it-- but stops him from killing himself instead. It's whimsical and amazing. Everybody wants Ray dead, including Ray himself, but somehow he is the only one who manages to make it through the film. And by the way, Ken's death is on my list of Most Unexpected Movie Deaths.\r\n\r\nHarry is frightening and consistently pissed off, but that makes him almost a comic relief. Besides coining the unforgettable phrase \"YOU'RE AN INANIMATE FUCKING OBJECT!!!\", he also brings a strange persona to the table. Yes, he's a mob boss (of some kind, it's never specified... and never necessary), but he also appreciates quaint little towns, and believes that anyone who kills a little boy should die. \r\n\r\nIt's tragic, profound, and fucking funny as fuck. A few scenes stand out as the best-scripted: In one, Harry has left a phone message with the woman who runs Ken's hotel, and she delivers it to him. Characteristically, it is filled with Henry's endless swear words. Ken tries to articulate an apology. Here's how it goes:\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry about that message, the man who left it, he's... well... he's a bit of a...\"\r\n\"A cock?\"\r\n\"Yes, he's a bit of a cock.\"\r\n\r\nJust little things like that make this movie cross the line between funny and ingenious. He doesn't want to use anything that could remotely be construed as a swear word around this woman, but she goes ahead and fills in the blanks for him. It's great shit.\r\n\r\nBut then again, you really can't read stuff like this on a screen and get the full depth of it-- you have to fucking see the movie, complete with Oscar-level acting and elaborate production design. Altogether an incredible feat of a film that blends tragedy and comedy to create the greatest black comedy of the 21st century. Prepare to be blown away like a midget in a courtyard (Spoilers! Oops).",

Colin Farrell plays Ray, a hitman new to the job who is sent to the Belgian city of Bruges with his older, more experienced partner, Ken (Brendan Gleeson). Ray wholly dislikes the city, while Ken is rather impressed by it. Soon however, their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), reveals further, more sinister details on why he sent them there and new instructions to be carried out. Tourists (many of which they correctly and incorrectly assume are Americans, medieval buildings, boating canals, and Belgian film crews are the sites the two guns for hire are surrounded by and find themselves immersed in, all to their eventual (if not previous) displease. Coupled with a pleasantly complex soundtrack from Carter Burwell, the long-time music collaborator of the Coen Brothers, and brisk, bloody action, the movie succeeds at being entertaining and wittily off-kilter in dealing with the standard dealings of the genre.",

Ray is guilt stricken after what occurred on his first hit and hates Bruges. Ken enjoys the days in Bruges, but knows that the \"little vacation\" won't last.\n\nThis is a must see film.

Brendan Gleeson is also fantastic, but the true great actor out of this movie is Ralph Fiennes, who is absolutely hilarious in every possible way.

Just thinking about some of his lines makes me crack up.\r\n\r\nIn what was a pretty decent year in film, 2008 delivered the likes of The Dark Knight, Slumdog Millionaire, Benjamin Button, and Frost/Nixon, but the true highlight of the year was the endlessly clever and masterfully made In Bruges.",

In all of the film's success at being strangely depressing and monotone whilst somehow being funny and scary at the same time it is easily the most original British gangster movie since Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. This is the rare piece of weird, smart and unpredictable filmmaking energy that brings more to the genre it belongs with than the average expectations. The perfect example of that is a Colin Farrell performance that isn't dull and two dimensional but rather brilliant and genuinely interesting. Through every minute of the film his hilariously deadpan fish out of water chemistry with Brendan Gleeson results in a brilliant pair of crime thriller leads. The directing is as creative and sensitive as you might have expected considering McDonagh won an Oscar for his short film \"Six Shooter\" and his keen eye for fleshing out the locations are no exception. Personally I loved the slow pace that he decided to go with, he proves that zany one liners and stupidly electrifying direction don't always have to be part of what makes a fun and entertaining thriller. This is solid filmmaking and one of the most understated films i've seen in a good while. The gloomy depressed tone of the film magnetises perfectly with original and weirdly upbeat black humour so much that I forgot it was a crime drama and not an Edgar Wright-esque dark comedy. In Bruges is indiscreetly violent to fantastic dramatic effect, there's vast amounts of broad and memorable scenes of truly nail biting tension, and not once does the film give out a single hint at where any of it is going. It's somehow an \"of the moment\" film but concurrently grips you throughout it's seemingly short lasting duration. It's still at the top of my list for the biggest surprises of 2008. McDonagh's latest flick Seven Psychopaths will have to be pretty damn flawless to appear superior, at least in my eyes.",

All in all, this first half had a sort of awkward, kinda bumbling pace to it. The second half sorta kicked it up a notch and felt more assured. The addition of Ralph Fiennes didn't hurt either.
