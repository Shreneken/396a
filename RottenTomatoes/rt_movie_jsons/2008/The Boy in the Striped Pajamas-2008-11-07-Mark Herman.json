    "summary": "During World War II, 8-year-old Bruno (Asa Butterfield) and his family leave Berlin to take up residence near the concentration camp where his father (David Thewlis) has just become commandant. Unhappy and lonely, he wanders out behind his house one day and finds Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), a Jewish boy of his age. Though the barbed-wire fence of the camp separates them, the boys begin a forbidden friendship, oblivious to the real nature of their surroundings.",

            "content": "The Boy in the stripped pajamas is an entertaining movie, a young German boy gets to know the concentration camp, led by his father who is a nazi popularity.\nHowever, I wouldn't recommend the movie as a source of historical information! It is a product of fiction and not historically accurate, it is totally unrealistic considering actual facts. This is what bothers me, I don't think that the holocaust is a topic to make fiction about. It is dangerous to change the actual history to a more entertaining one, it can be easily misunderstood. For people that don't have the historical correct knowledge, the movie will create a wrong perspective. I know that the movie doesn't claim to be factual but it still wants to show a typical family of nazi society and takes the holocaust as topic. In my opinion it is morally negligent to use this part of history and create another fictional version of it for entertainment reasons.",

            "content": "The movie was good overall, although I do have some complaints about it. \nIts about a boy, the son of a Nazi-commander, that moves with his family from Berlin to Poland. What the father does not know; his son, Bruno, can see the concentration camp Auschwitz. Bruno doesn't know what it is, so he just thinks that it must be a farm, and the people working there are farmers. Because Bruno had to leave behind his friends in Berlin, he was sad and started looking around for other kids to play with. His mother knows that somewhere around the house, there is a pathway leading to the camp, but she think it must be further away. \nEven though his mother does not allow him to \"explore\", what he loves to do, of course he sooner or later finds the pathway that starts in the backyard of the house. He starts to get curious as he sees one of the inmates working in his house as kitchen staff while peeling potatoes. He does not understand why he is wearing pyjamas, and thats where he starts asking questions. His parents don't really know how to explain to him what is happening. \nOverall, good movie, okay-ish represetation, and the seriousness of the movie is pretty average for a WW2 movie.",

Another aspect of the movie that was pretty good is that you see the moral conflict with this topic, for example the mother realizes what is going on in the concentration camp and says she doesn't want to be part of this.\nAlso the end is a great scene because the dad and the whole family realize on their own son what is happening in the concentration camps.\nI would totally recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 12!",

Bruno and Schmoel were acting very good too and thats why the ending was so sad and depressing.\nThe fact that Bruno didnt really know or believed that the farm was actually a concentration camp, were Jews were brutally murdered and used was crazy and made me tremble.\nI haven't seen many films that better portrayed the holocaust and WWII with nazi propaganda.\nThe whole story was very good written and id give this movie a 10/10 straight away even though the ending was heartbreaking!",

But the performances and depictions were top and I'd give the film a 10/10. I found the ending very horrible and the father should be arrested by the allied forces like in the book.",

As I said I would have appreciated if the Movie made it more clear on how time was passing. That said it did have some great Characters and acting. I thought the SS officer did a really good job at being a very stinky Bad guy. Bruno was confusing for me because with were he comes from he is not supposed to be all open and fair to the Jews because I assume that is not how he was raised seeing as his Father willingly fought for the Nazis. Schmuel did not have much depth to his character but seeing as it was not necessary I didnt have a problem with it.

            "content": "The Boy In The Striped Pajamas\nBy John Boyne\n\nI have watched the movie and I have read the book,\n\nThe Boy In The Striped Pajamas is about a young boy named Bruno that lives in Berlin. His dad is a German soldier that leads a concentration camp, Bruno meets a boy named Schmuel that is a prisoner in the concentration camp and the same age as Bruno, 8. Bruno visits Schmuel as often as he can until one day he snuck under the gate and he was mistaken for a jew and that was the day all the jews were put in the gas chamber.\n\nI recommend the book over the movie because the book has a lot more detail and events than the movie. I usually like the movie better but in this case i actually like the book better. It has a lot more meaning to me than the movie did. The movie did not include some detail that I thought was important, like how Bruno got his head shaved in the book but not in the movie.\n\nBruno looked a lot like what he was described in the book that he had short brown slicked back hair and he did in the movie. He was described as brave, curious. Bruno kept those traits in the movie. When he climbed under the fence to see Schmuel that was a brave act. \n\nA part of the movie that wasn't in the book was the ending. The ending in the book is where Bruno is lost and cannot be found and that's the day he went to go see Schmuel and climbed under the fence and it doesn't play out further than that. In the movie Schmuel brings Bruno clothes and Bruno brings Schmuel a sandwich but loses it on the way over to the camp. Bruno crawls under the fence and puts on the camp clothes, and after all the jews, including bruno died in the gas chamber his dad proceeds to look for him and demands all the guards to search for bruno, eventually Bruno's mom found his clothes that he swapped for the camp clothes next to the fence. Bruno's dad got the word that all the jews were put in the gas chamber and Bruno was one of them\n\nOne of the parts that were not in the book was when his dad shaved Bruno's head the day before he went to go see Schmuel and climb under the fence. In the movie Schmuel gave Bruno a hat to wear so the guards cannot tell that Bruno didn't have a shaved head.\n\nWith that detail missing from the movie it spiked my interest in the book because I think that was a good detail that they didn't add to the movie.\nI think that that detail didn't really affect the story line, it just made one of the lines more disappointing than I thought.\n\nFor this reason I recommend the book, only because I think the book had greater detail than the movie because the movie did not substantially change or substitute any scenes they took out of the movie. So because of that I recommend the book.\n\nIn conclusion I recommend you should read the book before the movie but still watch the movie.",

            "content": "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas by John Boyne \n\nI read the book and watched the movie, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is about a boy named Bruno growing up in World War 2. Bruno's family must move considering his dad got a new job. His family left Berlin and moved to the \"Out-With,\" what the Nazi's called Auschwitz, for his father's new job. I recommend the book over the movie. The book has a lot of detail, and it helps give you an understanding of what happened In Auschwitz.  \n\nWhen reading the book, I imagined the main character (Bruno) looking like a small white kid, with black hair and my imagination was remarkably like how Bruno was cast in the movie. In the book, Bruno follows the rules because he knows his dad would be mad if he does not, but he has a friendly, compassionate side to him that can sometimes lead him to trouble. \"Well, you're probably not allowed to come here and talk to me every day either,\" said Shmuel. \"But you still do it, don't you?\" \"But if I was caught, I'd be in trouble,\" said Bruno, who was sure if Mother and Father would not approve. The book is better than the movie.  \n\nIn the book, Bruno will not leave his mother alone when Bruno finds out they must move to the \"Out-With.\" In the book, Bruno is constantly asking his mother questions about the move. Bruno's mother is getting upset at him. The movie, the night before the family moved, Bruno's father threw a party for his new promotion, in the book, it does not say that. It did not increase my understanding, but more enjoyment of the movie. It affected the story line by adding a whole different part in the movie than the book. For this reason, I recommend the book.  \n\nThe part that was left out in the book that was in the movie was when Bruno scraped his knee, Pavel, and Bruno had an extended conversation until his mother arrived and he was peeling carrots after helping Bruno with his injury. The movie did not show any of that. This did not give me a better understanding at all. It affected the story lines by showing something else that did not happen. For this reason, I prefer the book considering the book has a lot of descriptions in it, rather than a movie. As you read this book, you can imagine it in your head. \n\nTo end off my writing about The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, the book has more to it than the movie, and it helps you think about what had happened in the past. The book makes you feel different emotions. I recommend the book than the movie.",

            "content": "I have read the book and watched the movie made after the book called the boy in the striped pajamas directed by Mark Herman. The story starts off with a boy named Bruno that must move with his family close to a concentration camp, but he doesn't quite understand what's going on with the people in striped pajamas. I recommend the book over the movie. \n\nBruno is portrayed as small for his age and doesn't like when people belittle him but overall, he is innocent and kind of ignorant because he didn't want to stop hanging out with Shmuel which ultimately gets him killed. Bruno kind of looks how I thought he would with his brown hair n everything, but I would have thought he would be a little smaller. In the book, the parents never really find out where Bruno went except by him walking around the fence one day and finding a spot in the fence where the wire could be lifted but, in the movie, the dad finds out where Bruno went rather quickly and realizes it's too late. This explains why I like the book better because it kind of leaves you rather abrupt and a kind of mystery to the parents rather than them knowing what happened to him at the end of the movie. \n\nA part of the movie that was not in the book was at the beginning of the movie when Bruno's parents throw an exciting party at their home in Berlin to celebrate Bruno's father's promotion. Which in the book Bruno comes home to see that his maid is packing his things and he kind of gets mad and his mom tells him that they must pack and move immediately, and he wonders if he has done something bad. When they changed it to the party it's kind of didn't give me that much understanding of what was going on. This change didn't really affect the storyline but did affect it when the family met the fury and had dinner with him. For this reason, I would recommend the book over the movie. \n\nA part of the book that wasn't in the movie was when Bruno could lift the wire from the ground because it was not secured properly in that part of the fence. In the movie, Bruno couldn't touch the fence because it was electrified, and he had to dig a hole under it to get out. It made me understand it more because it made more sense to have an electric fence because if it wasn't it probably would have been easier to get in and out. I feel like it affected the storyline because it made Bruno leave a trail of how he got in because of the shower he brought. I would still recommend the book because it leaves kind of a mystery for the family to find out what happened to him. \n\nOverall, I believe that the reader should read the book first and then watch the movie because the book is more explanatory about Bruno's thoughts than it is in the movie.",

The story takes place in 1942 in Berlin, Germany; the protagonist, Bruno, moves to a place he calls Out-With other, known as (Auschwitz) A concentration camp that his father oversees. Therefore, I recommend the book over the movie as it has more development toward the storyline and the history of World War II. \n\nAs I read the book, I thought Bruno would look shaggy with shorter hair and greenish eyes. In the movie, Bruno's is sophisticated with hair that is flicked to the side, but in the book, he has a shaved head as he has head lice. This proves that the book pays more attention to detail and characteristics.   \n\nBoth the movie and the book have differences. In the film, Bruno takes a shovel and digs a hole to get under the fence, but in the book, he takes a ladder and climbs over the wall. It never changed my perspective of the story; I still enjoyed it. For this reason, I recommend the book over the movie as it gives more storyline, unlike the film, which leaves many things out.   \n\nAs in the book, Bruno's father shaves his head as he gets lice, but in the movie, they never add that dialog or the change in design. It affected the storyline in how when he got his head shaved, he just got the pajamas from Shmuel, but in the movie, he had to put on a hat to cover his hair; then, the director made the movie longer. It never changed my perspective of the story; I still enjoyed it. For this reason, I recommend the book over the film as it gives more storyline, unlike the movie, which leaves many things out.",

They say that Bruno is unrealistic because every German child would have had hatred for Jews taught to them. Sure, many German children were indoctrinated with hatred for Jews - this movie *shows* that. The whole point is that Bruno is *skeptical* of that (while his sister, by contrast, swallows the indoctrination, at least initially). The whole point of the movie is that our common humanity transcends nonsensical sectarian hatred, and this is often recognized best by children who have not accepted the status quo of their surroundings. The point of the ending is ironic justice - Bruno's father, in a sense, kills his own son through his willing participation in the holocaust. If you think the message of this movie is \"Oh no we need to have pity for the poor innocent Germans during the holocaust\", you're an idiot with zero sense of irony and this movie is over your head. Also, people complain that Shmuel is unrealistic because the Nazis killed most children and there was no guard by the fence where the boys talked. Well, it's a fictional story, it's not a documentary that tells you how things normally occurred. Like a lot of movies, it's interesting precisely because it tells the story (real or fictional) of an *exceptional* or unique case which, by its unique nature, can teach us something. This is elementary stuff for how storytelling works. This is a very well done movie which shows the complexities of human interactions, and it communicates some very important lessons assuming you have an IQ above room temperature.",

Based on the novel by John Boyne, Mark Herman's compact and heart-breaking film brings us old pains in new ways. It's authentically human, if a tiny bit emotionally manipulative. Herman has made a simple Holocaust film, one that doesn't restate the obvious details about the horrors in those camps we know so well. Herman doesn't bother with German accents for his actors, or even the real thing. The Nazi family speaks with posh British accents, highlighting their class and how it affects their role in Nazi Germany. As the young boy Bruno, Asa Butterfield has the right blend of wonder, cleverness, and innocence. Vera Farmiga is stunning as the mother, letting us see the gears turn in her eyes. It's not a true story, but this emotional drama will take you on a wrenching journey into history's worst genocide from a new angle. Terrific",

The strongest aspect was the dialogue between Bruno and Schmuel, but other than that every other character is annoying, horrific and underdeveloped.

The naivety of the mother and the son is beyond any reality and many elements seem implausibly fabricated. e.g. a concentration camp without a fence patrol, .... Unfortunately, this film is not a helpful contribution when it comes to dealing with the sensitive topic named Holocaust.

            "content": "*SPOILER ALERT* WOW! Let me start by saying that this is one of those films where you only watch once. If you're looking for a film that'll leave you siding with the enemy yet disagreeing with them at the same time then watch this! Now I say siding yet disagreeing by hating the German family for what they allowed but siding with innocent Bruno, the son of the family who sees equality in all Jewish citizens. The film narrates the life of a German family that which the father, is a Nazi. The entire family seems a bit detached. The bonds between this family seems to lack love. Every character seems to be help captive of something; The mother is a housewife, the children are caged in, and the father is restricted since he's a Nazi. Clothing wise, every character is seen to wear specific outfits that match their personality. Since Bruno is a child he's always seen with suspenders and shorts, the mother and daughter in dresses and the father in his normal Nazi uniform. Sound played a huge par in this film as well. Throughout the film, lively music is played to express Bruno's innocence. Fast forward to the ending, the sound of the thunder and the dark clouds emphasizes reality in Germany. During the last scene, Bruno's eager personality puts him in danger. He wants nothing but to help his Jewish friend Shmuel not knowing that they are about to die. Them not knowing that they'll die shows their innocence. As kids, you don't think of the worst. Bruno was only trying to help his friend but was killed by his father and the rest of the Nazis. The last scene leaves you not only heartbroken but angry. The father put his family at risk for an awful racist group. Personally, I hated the last scene. With the dark clouds, loud fearful Jews, and innocent children, it was unfair to watch. The ending was no better. It left me wondering why they couldn't show the father mourning for his own actions. The film cut of immediately after Bruno died, which gives the audience suspense. All together, this was an amazing yet traumatic film to watch, hence why I said you only watch it once.",

In this way it is evident that premise that says that every war is absurd where victims fall from all sides.",

Asa Butterfield  as the main character is likeable and does a very good job of showing us the world from the eyes of a child.

Jack Scanlon was so amazing in playing the role of Shmuel, you can feel the chemistry between the two young actors which I think what made the movie so great, David Thewlis as Commander Ralf and Rupert Friend as Lieutenant Kotler were so amazing they both gave us these dirty and evil characters that you will hate after watching the movie, and Finally, Vera Farmiga as Elsa who I felt like in some scenes she was trying so hard to just fit into that character but could not, the only scene I liked was when she was fighting with her husband Commander Ralf, but other than that her facial expressions and acting were not that great.\n\nThe music score was not a problem at all, it added a great touch to a few scenes and it even made some scenes more emotional.\n\nThe movie showed us what life was during \"The Holocaust\" in such a genuine, dramatic, and emotional way because \"The Holocaust\" is a difficult subject for sure that many people suffered during it.\nHighly recommend this emotional / sad movie that will touch your heart and will leave you in tears after watching it.\n\nMy rating is 7/10\n\n(*For more movie / tv show reviews check out my Instagram page @Serious.Cinema)",

And its structure of having the climax as its ending leaves everyone a bitter taste until they sleep. Most find it as punch that makes it remarkable,  however for me, it's quite pleasant for a short story but not good enough for a film. Perhaps the book might have been better,  giving more context in the aftermath. I'll know once I read the book.

            "content": "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is the best of a few films that describe events of the Second World War telling us a little, but beautiful story based on the book called with the same name. Released in 2007, it stars Asa Butterfield as a young german boy and the english Jack Scanlon as a Jew child trapped in concentration camps. This drama/fiction movie filmed on the lovely landscapes of Budapest will surprise you apart from showing you the hard reality of the Jews at that time and will fill you with joy and passion for the feelings of friendship of children.\n\nAbout the actors and actresses, that play a fundamental role in this drama, are: Asa Butterfield as Bruno, he started his career at the young age of seven years, he participated also in interesting series like \"Merlin\" and memorables movies like \"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\" and \"The Ender Game\"; we can't forgot the incredible and satisfied paper of David Thewlis as Ralph, who act many times in the amazing Harry Potter's movies; in the other hand is Jack Scanlon as Shmuel, who start in action at the age of 9 in his first movie Peter Serafinowicz and finally is Vera Farmiga as Elsa, who played very important roles in movies like Dust and Down to the Bone that allow her to get the prize for best actress in 2007 on the Sundance Film Festival, also she participated in horror films like The Conjuring and its sequel. All of them, give a good performance, but the one that did his best was David Thewlis, he play correctly his paper, using the specific and the same characteristics of a commander in this time, serious, reserved, concentrated and responsible man.\n\nThis film was about Bruno, a young german guy; and his family that have to move to another house outside Berlin because Bruno's father job, so they have to say goodbye to all the things they started on this city. When, they arrived to their new house, Bruno didn't have anything to do, so he decides to explore a concentration camp in which all the jews are locked. There he made a friend called Shmuel and he plays with him any time he can. After some days Shmuel tell him that he doesn't find his father, so Bruno decides to help Shmuel and he enters to the concentration camp. This story ends with a very unexpected final, in which you will appreciate the true value of a good friendship. In my opinion it is a very interesting film, with a memorable story that invite you to reflect about how bad the Germans did at that time. Also it's represented very similar to the time in which it is set, so you feel that you are in this part of the world's history.\n\nSome aspects of the movie that are important to mention are the following ones: the scenography, in which I could see many beautiful landscapes and many things of the time like cars, telephones, clothes, houses and posters that make me feel inside the drama of this film; other good point was the soundtrack that perfectly accompanies each scene of this great movie and finally the special effects that were good for the time when the movie premiered, but they could improve. The best scenes of this film for me were two, in the first one Bruno was putting some food in his bag, when suddenly his mom appeared and asked what he's doing, at this moment it seems that she had already discovered, but Bruno, very clever, manages to save himself using a good excuse. And in the second one Bruno and Shmuel were playing with the ball, passing it from one side of the wall to the other, show us the friendly relationship that they have no matter which are their religions. The solidarity, brotherhood, empathy and being fair (human rights belong to everyone) are some of the emotional effects that produce this film on you because it shows how jews were treated at that time, all the things they mention about them, until the point of not considering them people, they followed the wrong way and this movie reminds it to us, to not make the same mistakes. \n\nI think many people will see this film because of its huge emotional value and its interesting history. About the fans of this film they feel very satisfied, even nowadays is not one of the best films, it makes you reflect and watch how were many things in that time. This I give this film a 4 out of 5 stars. \nBy: Jose Karlo A.",

            "content": "The Boy In the Striped Pajamas Movie Review\n\nThe Boy In the Striped Pajamas is a movie about a young boy who is oblivious to the horrible things that are going on right outside his home. The young boy makes friends with another boy that is inside of a concentration camp. The boy doesn't know that this boy is a Jew and he doesn't know what was happening to the Jewish people right outside his house. Some may think that The Boy In the Striped Pajamas does not accurately represent the Holocaust; however, this paper will assert that the movie is an accurate representation of the events and emotions that occured in the Holocaust. The movie shows how we are not born with hate in our heart. Through an analysis of concentration camps, the Germans, and the Jewish people, this paper will show how although the events in this movie are fictional, they show the true emotions and represent the actions of the Holocaust.\nIn the movie the concentration camps are portrayed using pathos. All the same emotions that were in the movie were the truest emotions of those that were in the concentration camps. In the movie it says,\"Sitting around miserable all day won't make you any happier.\" This quote shows that although they were in a horrible situation, they made the most of what they had. The people in the camps did nothing to deserve the treatment they got. A little boy in the camp becomes friends with the son of one of the men doing this to the Nazis. They young boys feel love towards each other because to them they were the same. This supports the pathos because the emotion they feel of love towards each other shows that they were not born with hate. This connects to the thesis statement because the young people in the holocaust did not understand because they weren't able to comprehend that someone could hate them so much to do this to them. \nThe movie portrays the negative and hateful emotions that the Nazi Germans showed to the Jews. The Nazi Germans were taught to absolutely hate the Jews and they were taught that they were not human and therefore didn't deserve to live. In the movie, Shmuel says, \" The soldiers. They took all our clothes away.\" Shmuel is the little boy who is in the concentration camp because he is Jewish and in this quote he is talking to his friend that lives near the camp, his name is Bruno and they talk through the fence. This quote shows that the Nazis took everything from the Jews and this is what happened in real life. It supports the thesis because this is an accurate event that happened. The Nazis didn't care about the Jews so they took everything from them, including their clothes.\nAnother thing that is accurately represented in the movie is the things that the Jewish people had to go through and their feeling. In the movie Bruno is the son of a man that runs the camps. Bruno is questioning who the people in the camps are and his father said, \"Those people... well, they're not people at all, Bruno.\" This is exactly how the Jews were treated, like they were not human at all. The Jews in the movie are portrayed exactly how it was in real events. The movie is so sad and uses patos because the emotion and sadness that you feel helps you gain sympathy for those who had to experience this. The Jewish people did nothing to deserve this and yet they had to go through it. This supports the thesis because the events are portrayed with the same emotions as the real life events.\nAlthough many argue that you have to be in the moment to understand the feelings that are felt, the movie uses the perspective of the people that were that and use their feelings. In the movie it says,\"Don't make it worse by thinking it's more painful than it actually is.\" The jews in the concentration camps were in a lot of pain and the movie shows that. Although it is a fictional movie, The Boy In The Striped Pajamas helps you understand the emotions of those that had to go through the Holocaust. You can understand partially understand the emotions by watching the movie.\nThe movie The Boy In the Striped Pajamas portrays accurate emotions and events of the Holocaust by correctly portraying the concentration camps, the Germans, and the Jewish people. The analysis of these topics support the thesis because in the movie they are the true emotional and eventful representation of the Holocaust. The movie teaches us that we are born to love but throughout growing up we are taught hate. Some think that that emotions can be understood unless you are truly at the event, but the emotions in this movie are those of the ones who were there. The Boy In The Striped Pajamas fulfills its purpose of informing us of the horrible and tender moments of the holocaust through pathos. \n\f\nAnnotated Bibliography: The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\nBrooks, Xan. \"Film review: The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas.\" The Guardian, Guardian News        \nand Media, 12 Sept. 2008, www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/12/drama.family.\nThe authors general stance towards the movie is positive because he talks about how it treads a fine line that the fate hangs in the balance until the end. His opinion is that it shows accurately how the events of the holocaust took place. He likes how it keeps you guessing until the end and goes the least expected way. The new insight to the movie is that it is a kind if dark reimagining of the secret garden, and the events of the holocaust. And what was truly happening in Germany during World War II. His review is using ethos to portray the movie, he talks about the ethics. It is a secondary source because it is a review from someone that saw the movie. The strengths of the source are in his opinion of how it treads the fine line of fate. The weakness of his review is the length of it, because it is a short review.\nEbert, Roger. \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas Movie Review (2008) | Roger Ebert.\" \nRogerEbert.com, 5 Nov. 2008, \nwww.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-boy-in-the-striped-pajamas-2008.\nThe authors general stance towards the movie is positive, because they talk about the powerful impact that the movie has because of the story being told through an eight year old's eyes and not an adult. This gives a new light to the events of the Holocaust because its not through the perspective of an adult, but a child. This review uses logos because it gives a lot of logical reasons why telling through a child's eyes can change what people think about certain events. The strength of this review is the powerful word choice and impact that it has. The weakness is that the article doesn't give much detail into other parts of the movie.\nHerman, Mark. \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas (The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas).\" The Boy in \nthe Striped Pajamas (The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas) (2008) - Rotten Tomatoes, 8 Jan. \n2018, www.rottentomatoes.com/m/boy_in_the_striped_pajamas.\nThe authors general stance towards the movie is neutral, because they believe that it takes a unusual stance on the holocaust, and is very dark. They like the way it ends with a brutal final punch of a twist. The new insight is about the dark and unusual stance towards the holocaust, and the brutal punch of a twist at the end. His review uses pathos because he shows emotion in his word choice. This makes the reader interested by the way he explains the sad ending. The strengths of the review are the numbers it shows and the reasons that the movie was the percent it was. The weaknesses of the review are that it is very short and lacks a lot of detailed information. This is a secondary source because it is from someone who reviewed the movie and not the actual movie itself. \nO, Review A. \"Something Is Happening.\" The New York Times, The New York Times, 11 Nov. \n2006, www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/books/Scott.t.html.\nThe authors general stance towards the movie is positive, because they talk about the exciting release of the book and movie. And give insight into the making of the movie and the story behind it. It goes into detail on the story of it and not so much the actual movie, but the backstory on it. The strength is the detail and length of the review. This review uses ethos because a credible source that is well known and liked is the author of this review. The weaknesses of the review are that it doesn't depict the events in the movie but the backstory. This review is a secondary source because it is someone who read the book and then wrote their own paper about what they thought about it, rather then being the actual book which is a primary source.\n\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas.\" Metacritic, Miramax Films, 7 Nov. 2008, \nwww.metacritic.com/movie/the-boy-in-the-striped-pajamas.\nThe authors general stance towards the movie is positive, because they talk about how powerful the movie is at providing a look in the prejudice, hatred and violence affect innocent people. They like how the story is told through an 8 year old, and not an adult. The new insight into the movie is about how bruno and shmuel can have a great friendship even though bruno's dad is the leader of the concentration camp and shmuel is in the concentration camp. This is a secondary source because it is a review of the movie or book which are the primary source. The strength of this review is the powerful word choice in it. The weakness is that the review does not explain very well what it is talking about.",

            "content": "The Strength of Innocence Reigns Over All\n\n\tThe Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a film depicting the story of the Holocaust through the perspective of an eight-year-old boy, Bruno (Asa Butterfield). It was produced for the soul purpose of opening your eyes to the reality of not only the devastating times but also the reality through the perspective of an innocent child.\nThis mind-boggling film starts out with Bruno playing with his friends in Berlin, then coming to the realization that his family is moving to the countryside due to his fathers' (David Thewlis) promotion in the military. As his family arrives to the new house, Bruno discovers what he comprehends to be a farm. One with knowledge about the Holocaust will come to the realization that this \"farm\" is a concentration camp that Ralf, Bruno's father, is in command over. As they get settled into their new surroundings, Bruno begins to ponder about the \"farm\" in the distance. \nHe just moved away from his beloved friends, friends he grew up with. Now he is surrounded strictly by family and the people that work for them. All of these people seem to have their plates full, and never have time to spare a moment to play with Bruno. This leaves him to fend for himself when it comes to entertainment. Bruno loves adventure; he is always seeking new things to explore, which leads him to the concentration camp seen from his new house. \nWhen Bruno comes across this camp, there is a boy in \"pajamas\", Shmuel, (Jack Scanlon) sitting alone beside a pile of concrete blocks. Over the next several weeks, Bruno builds a friendship with \"the boy in the striped pajamas\" despite the enormous barbed-wire fence standing between them. During this time, there is an incident with Shmuel and a soldier at Bruno's home. Shmuel is not seen for several days after this. As an innocent boy, Bruno does not understand why his friend is no longer coming to the intimidating fence at the camp. One day he reappears and is more mournful than usual. Bruno learns of the cause for his newly made friends' emotions and decides he is going to help.\nDuring this time, Bruno's mother, Elsa (Vera Farmiga) comes to find out that the camp is killing Jews due to the lack of respect from a soldier when he proclaims, \"they smell even worse when they burn.\" Because of this gruesome statement, Elsa decides it is in the family's best interest to move away from the camp in order to raise Bruno and his sister, Gretel, (Amber Beattie) appropriately. The day that the three of them are scheduled to leave, Bruno escapes to the camp in attempt to help Shmuel. It is in this moment of the film that you really understand how devastating the Holocaust was. The next few scenes leading up to the end of the film unfold the reality of two innocent children trying to make sense of the evil in this world.\nAs I watched this film I continuosly compared it to The Book Thief, in which the young girl moves to Germany due to the loss of her mother and must find a way to survive. The girl in that film does not understand that the Holocaust is taking place; she is just trying to survive and does so because of her innocence.\nThis film not only expresses the heart-wrenching pain caused by the Holocaust, but also the innocence that the children had during this time. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas was not created in a way that tells the story of the Holocaust like the typical straight forward film does, instead it provides you with a new perspective, that of an innocent eight-year-old boy. A boy with the only intentions of exploring new places and creating new friends.\nIt takes a certain dedication to portray a story in a way that not only tells the history of the Nazis and Jews but also provides a perspective that the majority of people seem to forget exists. This film shows the strength innocence has in times of desperation, which is exactly why you should spare 94 minutes of your life to embrace the heart-wrenching reality of one of those innocent children during a life-changing moment in history.",

A very realistic and very hard movie on the concentration camps, and the story is really poignant, and the characters are well written and superbly interpreted by very convincing actors. Asa Butterfield in the role: Bruno and Jack Scanlon in the role of Shmuel (the Jewish boy) and Vera Farmiga in the role of Asa's mother and David Thewlis in the role of Asa's father. A movie that fills the spectator with emotion, a great film of its kind, because all these wars are also all the misfortunes of the world that fall on the heads of the innocent, a movie to be discovered absolutely for its sensitivity to the skin",

I wail at the drop of a hat - I'm talking Muppet movies and Campbell's soup commercials - but I was too busy rolling my eyes and feeling a bit pandered to to feel any raw emotion from what was happening in the story. It was a ludicrous plot point with an excruciatingly predictable outcome rubbed out by a director who thinks he's suddenly started shooting the next Schindler's List. I can't blame the actors, as they were all masterful, especially Vera Farmiga, and the young actors portraying Bruno and Shmuel. If the novel, which I have not read, has the same climax/resolution as this film, then I absolutely blame the author for this mess, and would have thrown the book in the fireplace after reading it. Perhaps it went into greater detail in why the \"decision\" (without spoiling anything) was even made in the first place, other than to give the characters a reason to reach the story's conclusion, and to make people reach for their Kleenex. If that's the case, then it's a shame, because thanks to this movie, I have virtually no desire to ever read it to find out for myself.",

            "content": "War is said to either bring people together or tear them apart. The movie The Boy in the Striped Pajamas demonstrates both outcomes in a heart wrenching tale about a Nazi soldier's son and his unlikely new companion. The heartbreaking story begins in Berlin, where the son Bruno's life is that of an ordinary eight years old boys. All this will change once his Father asks the family to go with him on his assignment as a soldier during World War II, where the progression of tragedy begins. This tragic story is brought to life through many aspects such as acting, costume, and plot, all of which give the movie great emotional appeal.\nThis movie would not have this great emotional appeal if it were not for the actors. Asa Butterfield brilliantly portraits the son, Bruno. For such a young actor Butterfield shocks his audience with such great expression of emotion. Asa makes his act believable through his facial expressions and delivery of lines. Often when he speaks his voice echoes innocence and when appropriate, confusion. The main physical feature he uses to portray his innocence are his eyes. He often widens them in awe and uses them to connect with the audience by looking either directly in the camera or intently at the other characters. One of those other characters is his father, who is also a Nazi soldier, played by David Thewlis. As the story progresses David smiles less and less showing how the war is beginning to impact his character. He shows little reaction to the cruelty played out in the movie, hardly flinching. This stillness that David brings further portraits his character as a harsh, unforgiving Nazi soldier and starkly contrasts Bruno.\nThere is an even greater contrast seen between the Jewish and German characters in the film. This contrast is emphasized through the characters of Bruno and Schmuel with the use of costume and set. Bruno is a well dressed little boy, surrounded by a well dressed family, in a big beautiful house. While Schmuel, who lives but a mile away, wears rags in a fenced in suffering \"community\". While what they wear sets them apart, what really shows the social divide between the Germans and Jews is the wall around Bruno's home. When first driving up to the house it is evident that what is inside the boundaries of their home is vastly different from what is on the outside of it. This movie does a wonderful job in costume and set, setting up the movie for success in showing the social divide between the Jews and Germans during World War II.\nMark Herman, the director has a lot to do with the success of the movie as well. Thanks to him the plot progresses in a way that flows and wastes no scenes. The movie lets you see glimpses into how the war impacted each person's life differently. From the grandparents to Bruno's sister we get a taste of the many different perspectives on the war. While the movie could have expanded on the other character's experiences a bit more, having only a brief look allows for each scene to serve a purpose and avoids filler. Due to that success in plot the movies emotional appeal continues to be its best quality throughout the film.\nThis original idea to show a Nazi soldier's son and an eight years old Jewish prisoner leads the audience to feel great sadness. This sadness is not only drawn from the film but from a real history of hatred towards a people who were not understood. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is not a movie to be watched purely for entertainment, but also to reflect on the past and on the actions of the Nazi's towards the Jews. That is what brings true greatness to the film not just the acting, progression of plot, and costume, but the historical accurateness.",

It brings a novel perspective to the Holocaust from the point of view of a German child, Bruno, while also showing us more typical perspectives, such as the perspective of a Jewish child in a concentration camp, the transformation of Bruno's sister due to brainwashing and propaganda, and the separation of Bruno's parents as duty to their country conflicts with morality.  This film's other assets are the wonderful performances of young leads Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon, and Vera Farmiga's incredible performance as Bruno's mother, which brings a lot of emotional depth to the film.\n\nIn short, \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\" is a touching, albeit predictable film with the beautiful message that if we could all be like children and look past cultural differences and see different people as human beings, the world would be a better place.",

Based on the well known history of the Nazis treatment of Jews within concentration camps, this sees the story of two eight year old boys that begin to build a friendship from opposite sides of the electric fence. Little do they know what the future holds for both of them, nor how their respective families are sworn enemies, and with the audience fearing the worst all the way through the movie, the inevitable is soon sprung upon us (with a little added twist for good measure). As racist as this may make me look, I didn't feel as affected as one should, but I believe that to be because it felt somewhat of a rushed conclusion. Don't get me wrong, the whole idea of this part of history is one of the most tragic known to man, but it didn't make the most of what should have been a long drawn out and emotional moment. You couldn't have asked anything more from two young actors, who played their part to the max, but the speed at which the events unfolded, with little time to reflect on what happened, really didn't do the rest of the build up justice. I truly thought this was a very captivating watch, which for an avid hater of history, is really saying something. The whole plot around the German boys family was well delivered, giving an engrossing sub story to what was really the main focus between the two kids. I didn't take my eyes off this for a second, and although you could argue that my opinion was possibly influenced by spoilers given prior to viewing this, I really couldn't help but feel it was lacking that little something to truly pull on the heart strings. Not really one to watch over again, as unfortunately the ending will never change, but definitely an educational spectacle, and a worthwhile recommendation.",

Such is the case with The Boy In The Striped Pajamas, a movie concerning that darkest of modern events, the Holocaust. My 2 biggest issues with the movie was the pacing and performances of the child actors, particularly the lead. He had a number of genuine moments, and by the end I felt quite strongly for him, but much of his delivery is too wooden to be believable, and it often looks as though he's reading his lines off screen. But the parents, especially the mother, played wonderfully by Vera Farmiga, who very often steals the show completely, are both excellent. The pacing is very leisurely, and it often feels like the film has no idea where it wants to go, simply bobbing along for most of its run time. But as I got to the end, I realised that might have been the intention all along. The movie would be worth watching for the conclusion alone, which ends the events on an incredibly bleak, heart-breaking note through the use of camerawork, music and acting. By the time the credits rolled I was still and silent, utterly unable to comment on what I'd just witnessed. It might be a one-time-only film, but it's one you won't be forgetting in a hurry.",

But what disturbed me are just how much the detractors missed some of the key points and devices that to me were clearly on the minds of the movie's makers.  Even worse, some of these critics wandered into the very soulless lack of human empathy that allowed the Holocaust to take place.   You can go elsewhere to read the basic plot, which would be a good idea if you haven't seen the movie yet, as otherwise you will likely not be able to grasp the points I want to make in this review.  So let me take on some of the major objections in order to rebut them in earnest:  The Germans speak in perfect British accents. But how can the critics miss the obviousness of this device? It's not mainly to make the film palatable to audiences.  We've been conditioned to automatically associate heavy German accents with WWII evil. What good would it serve us to 'know' from the start, and even through the eyes of an innocent, trusting 8 year old son of a high ranking soldier, that his father and all he stands for is evil?  No!  We NEED to be massaged by the comforting regalness of that British accent into seeing everything and everyone around us as being good and noble.  The device works splendidly.  Another major criticism is that the story lacks credulity.  Oh, please! Have these dolts never heard of a morality tale that takes enough elements of reality to create a story that is compelling enough to make that reality MORE than documentary? That's the whole point of this film!!!  The Holocaust as seen through the eyes of two children here is miles beyond that horrid travesty \"Life is Beautiful\", the worst film about this historical event to have ever been made. And lest anyone think that we get coloring book people that are all good or all bad, every single character explored in depth here has both sides of their human nature seen. The death camp commandant is a loving father, tender in his interactions with his children.  His mother hates what he has become but blames herself for dressing him up in uniforms as a child. Before his wife becomes the 'good German' conscience, she relishes in the power and privilege that her husband's career brings. And most important, his young son betrays his Jewish secret friend at the very point that telling the truth would have protected the unfortunate boy.  Finally, the ending.  For that, you must see the film.  But to call it contrived, forced, unconvincing are all nothing but the conceits of a smug kind of critic who is lurking in the shadows looking for something to pounce on. Do we attack fables for not imitating historical life? That would be absurd!  So, ignore the critics who did precisely that here, and see this film.  The book may have been intended for older children and young teens, but the movie is every bit as much fitting fare for adults.  Life isn't always beautiful.",

The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a great film that gives an idea about how German's lives were at during the war. Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon are terrific and they have great chemistry together. Vera Farmiga and David Thewlis are great also. The plot is not that special, but it's the kid leads that matter. It has a shocking end that probably would end up as a tearful moment. The characters are decent, and the writing is really good and Mark Harmon knows how to write children characters.

Their friendship is never really fully developed as there are not that many scenes with them together, which was a shame as it would've made the final scene a lot more emotional. As with the atrocities that went on behind those fences all are kept off screen, it would of been a lot beneficial to see more of what they had to go through then be kept in the dark for most of it. I did like that not every person in the film agreed with what was happening, we know the Nazi's were an evil race but not everyone shared their views.

Let's start with the story: the story behind this film is clearly that of irony because (spoiler alert?) the boy is not a fallen hero who redeems the world with his sacrifice.  It's rare that we get to witness a screenplay based on a story of irony, and so I really appreciate this.  Next up is the ending.  My wife and probably many other movie goers would like closure on the story.  Perhaps a memo pre-closing-credits that would explain what was done about the situation.  Little do they realize, such a clumsy summation would destroy the powerful emotion attached to this ending.  I prefer to keep my mind blown for a minute thanks.  Last, the acting in this film is the only area I can say would need improvement because I found at some parts I was unconvinced by the acting and it gave rise to a deep inner conflict.  On the other hand, with the written material the actors were working with, I find it hard to believe that the cast could have sold the story better.  It really is a difficult sale.  Costumes, props, set, lighting and directing were all excellent and while I don't recommend this film for everyone, the people I wouldn't recommend it to I don't consider worth very much of my time.  Thank you Mark Herman.  This was a good film.",

            "content": "\"Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights, before the dark hour of reason grows.\" That's the first line in this movie. And think if you were a boy, and grew up in the holocaust. When I was in sixth grade, my teacher had us read the boy in the striped pajamas. Yes, while the other kids read the Lightning Thief (a book I'd later read, and helped me becoming a writer) my class read the book about the kid in the holocaust. Then we all watched the movie, and it's pretty damn good. And as far as movie adaptations go, this is one of the best goes. It's not the novel, but it's the film version of the novel. Everything good about the book was used, and parts not as good were replaced, and it covered everything. That's how film adaptations should be. And from what I heard this movie is pretty well received, but I find that surprising since I expected most wouldn't like it because I kind of feel you'd have to read the book to really appreciate it. Anyway the movie is about a boy named Bruno, and his dad is a high class Nazi in a big situation where he must move his family over to a house next to nearby concentration camp to basically be the overseer. I'm pretty sure that's what he does anyway. But that's the thing, like the book, you almost see the movie through Bruno's perspective. You feel the pressure as people tell Bruno this backwards way of life, where Jews are evil, and not people at all. But before that happens, Bruno meets his friend Shmuel, a Jew in the concentration camp. Yes, Bruno nonchalantly walks up to the fence up a concentration camp, and he now has a friend. And that is the real picture painted. Two friends, on two different sides of a fence. That fence means everything, and nothing at the same time. Through the movie there is a lot of little arcs, and little information. And in movie form I'm surprised it works. And seeing Bruno in these situations where he doesn't really think much of something, when something really big actually happened, it really gets to you. I'll give an example. At one part Bruno falls off of this swing. The only other person around is one of the Jew house workers. Now, if he touches Bruno, he's fucked. But if he just let's Bruno sit there, he's fucked. But the guy's a former doctor, and he helps Bruno up, and heals his wound, and has a really good conversation with him. And little Bruno had no wonder at what he just started. But luckily the guy got off  free... for now. Carrying on! Also I'd like to talk about the acting. The kid who plays Bruno, he did fantastic. I think this was his first movie, and he didn't look at all like he was. I was so invested into his character he wasn't even a child actor in my brain anymore, he was way gone and he was just Bruno, the kid who played him didn't exist when he walked off set. Most child actors you hate, and also Shmuel does a pretty good job as well. In fact, everyone does good, and nobody really messes up. And this is one of those movies that are getting points just for making you think, and plucking at those emotional scenes. It's dramatic tragedy, and is frankly one of the most grabbing endings that stick with you. I do believe the book did grab that ending a little tiny bit better, but considering it's in firs-person, and the movie isn't so much about Bruno, the newer ending with additional footage that was kind of grabbing extra stuff is still very welcome as it is sad. So ladies and guys who are nicknaming them \"man tears,\" get ready to get some tissues. But another thing the movie captures is a lot similar to the quote in the beginning of this review. A childhood is based off of sounds and noises and pictures. Things we can't really understand. And this whole movie almost feels like one big memory that old Bruno is remembering, and is now making sense of. There are so many references to dark things, things he just doesn't get. But rarely does it get super dark and Nazi evil, for the most part it feels what I consider realistic. We remember the holocaust as this dark evil place, but in reality lots of normal things happened, there was just a big evil thing going on in the back of their brains, or under their nose. But occasionally there will be that guy, that one really racist dick or another (the teacher and others) who just say something that's really offensive. So it is emotional, and it is a good movie. And this movie I will remember as the movie I watched in my childhood that had linked with the book. I can't not remember it without thinking of the book and my old class, it's impossible. But movies are suppose to do that, they bring parts of our lives into them. And the boy in the striped pajamas is one of those movies that have a special place fore me.",

The relationship between the two boys lies at the heart of the movie, yet they seemed unusually distant.  After all, the movie seeks to examine the extermination of Jews through the eyes of children.  Vera Farmiga played her role well, as Bruno's mother, but I found the brilliant David Thewlis to be somewhat constrained by the role of Bruno's father.  An enjoyable film, though we must now be coming to the end of innovative ways of dealing with the holocaust on film.",

It DOES deal with the Holocaust, after all. I really should read the book someday. Mhmmmm\n\nThe acting and script writing was wonderful. They picked a great cast. They picked a really good family...they look like a real family. Bruno looks like a spitting image of the \"mom\", while Gretel looks a lot like the \"father\". Which I think they did on purpose. \"Father\" is a Nazi and believes in the cause and the daughter takes after those thoughts and beliefs for a time. \"Mom\" at first is rather naive and innocent about what her husband does (meaning he runs the concentration camp a few blocks away), but then finds out and despises it and him, and then Bruno is similar. Granted he doesn't ever really understand what his father is doing. I loved Shmuel. Probably the cutest kid. Great kid to play the role, he did a wonderful job. I really wonder why none of the actors won an Oscar. Oh well.\n\nI have nothing to complain about. I just wish they would have played around more with Gretel's development as well. Oh well...also I hated the ending. Mind you, it was a FANTASTIC ending. However, I cry EVERY TIME! I've watched this well over five times now and I still cry like a child. I did watch this with Boyfriend on our second movie date a while back, so I had to restrain myself immensely. I also watched it in my Humanities class and the buff, football playing tough guy next to me even teared up a wee bit.\n\nOverall, this is one of my favorite movies. Top Twenty (I should make a list of my top twenty movies, so far).  It does have a rather sad ending, but it's just a great, great movie. If you like Drama or have any interest in History or just movie watching, you need to watch this. You will love it too. Out of five stars I grant this one 5 stars.\n\nFavorite Character(s): Bruno's Mom, Bruno's Dad (just because I adore the actor) Bruno, Shmeul (cute kid), and Grandma\nNot-so Favorite Character(s): Gretel. >.>",

The movie stars Asa Butterfield who really shines in this movie and also stars in another great film (Hugo, 2011). The movie is all on his shoulders and if not done right, the film would fall apart. But Asa Butterfield proves his acting chops (at a very surprisingly young age), and leads the film very well. The score by James Horner fits the movie perfectly setting the stage for the director and cinematographer to do a very good job.The supporting cast is also at first okay. Then out of nowhere, (right at the halfway point) the supporting actors and actresses bring on their A game which really pays off in the end. An ending that is terrifying, unexpected, and chillingly real of events that did in fact happen during WWII that still haunts victims to this day.",

            "content": "If you want the definition of ironic, it would be the plot to The Boy In the Striped Pajamas. Everybody knows the story of Hitler and 1940's Germany. A military man moves his family out into the country so he can work at a concentration camp. His eight year old boy wanders off and finds the camp and befriends a Jewish kid from the other side of the fence. A combination of the child's naivety, strong story, and somber music makes this movie very powerful and brings a new insight to WW2.\nThe main force behind this movie and what really keeps it going is Bruno. He is the eight year old boy and the main character. He is forced to move away from his friends in Berlin and is looking for a new friend. He meets a Jewish boy in the concentration camp and he has no idea what is going on. He is young and knows little of the war and the terrible things his father and countryman are doing. There are moments in the movie where he asks stupid questions and it makes the audience just go, \"oh, no. I know the answer, how can you be so blind?\" Then I remembered he was eight years old and has no business knowing what is going on. His older sister is twelve and she gets it. She talks about joining the Hitler youth and she becomes war driven. She is being brainwashed and corrupted by the adults around her. Her whole existence is the show the vile works of the Germans in that time. It's odd how each character in the family is completely different, obviously it is on purpose.\nWe have Bruno, the main character who is completely blind and innocent. It is his blindness and innocents which makes the movie. Then we have the father, Ralph, who is also Professor Lupin in Harry Potter, just a side note. He is the definition of evil. He works at the camps. My favorite scene is when they are all at dinner and he basically interrogates one of his officers and finds out his father was Jewish. On the spot he has the man taken into the other room, beaten, and killed. It is a powerful scene and shows the reality of the situation. One could argue that it's not his fault because he is just following orders and Germany was corrupt by one insane tyrant, but that's not the point. This movie isn't about the war or Hitler or even the Jews. It is about the relationship between the two young children battling the odds Then there is my favorite character in the entire movie, and that is the mother. She is special so she gets her own paragraph.\nElsa is the mother of this family and she is protective of her children. She knows the danger bit is also blinded by her surroundings. She knows what her country is doing with the Jewish people but she has no idea that they are dying. She finds out that they are being gassed and burned and she flips out. This says a lot about her character and how she did not approve of her countries actions. This is a bold move by the director because he disproves the stereotype that everybody in Germany hated the Jews and approved of Hitler. She is a strong character an gives the movie a different edge.\nThe movie is a little slow at first and it takes a while for the backbone of the plot to kick in. This movie is 94 minutes and it takes a while before the two boys even meet and build their friendship. Another problem is the little screen time the little Jewish boy is in the movie. The title of the movie is about him and he isn't really seen as much. When he is on screen he tries to tell the truth to young Bruno. He is eight years old and he knows and understands everything that has happened to him. There is one point in the movie where Bruno messes up and it almost costs him his life. I like Bruno as a character but he was a coward and he made foolish mistakes. As the movie progressed I began to realize there were only two outcomes to this story and both are very sad.\nPacing problems, limited time with a main character and my major problem is the lack of character development. Every character with the exception of the mother is the exact same from the opening credits to the end credits. The father is a jerk. The boy is foolish and his sister is corrupted. This made the movie a little boring and even though it was a short film it felt really long. I wanted to see more but I can't think what else could have been seen. The strengths definitely outweigh the weaknesses but the weaknesses are still substantial.\nOverall, I did enjoy The Boy In the Striped Pajamas. The music added an emotional touch throughout and one thing you need to understand is that the main character is a kid and you need to think like a kid to understand what he does. By no means is this a happy movie, but more tragic with a few glimpses that would make any parent proud. Watch this movie but be warned, it is not for the faint of heart. The acting isn't anything remarkable, the characters are strong but have little development, but overall enjoyable. This movie gets the WillyT Honorable Mention.",

I think the film captured the book well, portraying Bruno's blundering innocence, which verges on annoying, when he doesn't grasp perhaps not exactly what is going on in the \"farm\" next door, but at least that it is not a bed of roses over there like he seems to think. The film portrayed the ending well, although deviated slightly from the book for a more dramatic impact.",

            "content": "Popularity of a Labrador, bravado of a Bulldog, confused as a Cockerpoo and Totally Shih-Tzu.  \n\nThis WWII drama follows Bruno and his German family from their family home in Berlin to their new house following his Father's promotion.  His Father is presumably an SS Officer and he is to become the new Governor of a concentration camp (loosely based on Auschwitz).  The new home is next to the camp and the audience watch as Bruno slowly finds out more and more about the situation as the wool can no longer be pulled over his eyes.  It is very much a movie about viewing the holocaust through the eyes of a child.  When he views the camp for the first time through his bedroom window (having been shielded from the truth by his parents) he thinks he can see farmers tendering the land in their nightwear. \n\nI am very interested in anything related to the Second World War.  I really wanted to like this film, but I can't; 'cos it's crap. \n\nMany people who have seen the film find it shocking.  I must admit that I did too.  We see the Swastika's flying on the red Nazi flags, the German troops and are aware we are in the German capital in the 1940's.  The first man opens his mouth to speak and out flows the English language.  I found this shocking, but was intrigued to see how this would work.  \n\nAs the film continued my irritation was building to a crescendo.  It's not like Schindler's List where, everyone speaks with various accents, but speak English as it's an American Movie.  The Nazis  speak with the thickest of English accents, as do the Jews, the children and the rest of the world presumably.  It really is the clearest \"Queens English\", I can just image one of the SS officers turning to the other and saying;  \"Pardon me old boy, would you mind awfully if we stopped for a spot of afternoon tea before we stroll over the road and bump 'orf a couple of dozen gentlemen of the Jewish persuasion?\"\n\nImage a new movie is coming out called \"Churchill\", which is made by Germans but set in England.  Imagine that we're in the height of WW2 and the family gather around the wireless to hear our Prime Minister speak.  We hear him deliver his most famous of speeches - \"We shall go on to the end.  We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills;  we shall never surrender\". Now image that its delivered in the thickest German you've ever heard!  \n\nPersonally I find this aspect of the film insulting.  As a Brit and for the Germans.  It's not a subtle thing, its very \"in your face\" and clearly done on purpose.  It doesn't stop at the language either.  Everything about this movie wreaks of English culture. I did consider whether it was portrayed like this so the audience would relate more or perhaps to bridge a cultural separation.  But for whatever reason, it doesn't work and was a poor choice.  Especially in the scene where they view the film that has been made to eradicate peoples doubts in the camp - that its more of a holiday camp than a death camp. \n\nMoving on; everything from the acting, to the music, to the wardrobe is inaccurate, weak and feels like a cheap amateur production.  The story is supposed to be a tragedy, but I couldn't get into the film enough to feel anything.  It's just too unbelievable.  I can't believe that some of the actors were selected for their roles.  I just can't understand why.  Maybe they were the only ones to turn up on the day?  Jack Scanlon (Shmuel) is particularly bad.  As far as acting goes, I feel Henry Kingsmill (who played Karl) was the best by a long way.  More convincing than anyone else on screen throughout. \n\nFor me, the movie is all mixed up, back to front and round the wrong way.  Jewish characters played by clearly non-Jewish actors, the movie is all in English but the literature is in German, the German child is brunette and the Jewish child is blonde and most notably 6,000,000 Jews were murdered in the holocaust yet this is a tragic story of 1 Nazi child who was killed alongside.  \nIf you swap the Nazi's, the Jew's and the concentration camp for Al Qaeda, American citizens and the Twin Towers America would boycott the movie and label it as seriously poor taste.\n\nOn a positive note, I felt that certain scenes seemed metaphorical.  Which I found quite insightful.  Such as when Bruno (Asa Butterfield - one of the better actors in the movie) lies about being friends with Shmuel out of fear.  As maybe many Germans did at the time. \nI found the scene where his Father is deciding to \"come clean\" and tells his son; \"Those people ... are not really people at all\" quite a good reflection on how Germany saw Jews, as parasites.  I would have liked to see that scene go on a little longer.  Perhaps to answer some of the questions Bruno may have asked.\n\nI found it a clever idea that Bruno asked questions and in the lack of response the viewer seems to answer them in their own mind.  This way it becomes very personal.  It would have been very powerful, if it wasn't so transparent. \n\nIn short The Boy in Striped Pajamas strives to be a sentimental, heartfelt, shocking tale of discovery.  But is ultimately an unbelievable, naive, clearly fictional story that is only shocking to those previously unaware of the situation.  It loses marks for being unconvincing, making poor choices in direction, being weak throughout and personally found it insulting to me and the darkest hour of World War II.",
