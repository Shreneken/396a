And don't get me started with that voicemail sound which I made my own ringtone in middle school when this movie came out lol. Compared to bloody valentine (and others) where it's just all gore but no substance, at least this film gives us loads of haunts and those feelings of hopeful that they can be saved. Also the porcelain creatures haunting everyone through the phone and the way that there's no escaping this end game is just the icing of the cake. It's almost like the boogie man/candy man where we can't even fall asleep without knowing we can die any time. I personally loved it!!!",

            "content": "I'm a little surprised this movie was criticied to the extent that it was. That being said, I'm not going to say it was a good movie or anything, but I have TOTALLY seen worse. The acting wasn't that bad- it obviously wasn't even close to oscar-winning standards of course, but for the movie I think it was convincing enough. In terms of scare factor, it wasn't that scary. There aren't really any horrifying images either. Perhaps only in one scene that comes to mind. The part that was most disappointing are things in the storyline that just don't work for me:\n1. The origin of this \"phone curse\". So we see that this originated when Ellie was locked in her room after getting caught physically harming her younger sister, Laurel. Ellie begins to suffer an asthma attack, who then desperately bangs on the door for help, then tries to dial her mother's number in her phone as she dies, thus beginning the phone curse, with Ellie's mother as the first victim. Not to look at it too logically, but when Ellie was first caught by her mother, hurting Laurel, I'm sure what (at least partly) brought on her asthma attack was the stress of getting caught and what this might mean for her. Obviously she has psychological issues, but perhaps she was scared her mother wouldn't love her anymore? Or she'd get sent away? Then her asthma attack begins, and she's panicking as she knows she needs medical help. She's banging on the door for her Mum to help, and tries to call her- again, for medical help, as she is in a medical emergency. So why on Earth would she even be thinking about starting some kind of \"killer phone curse\" when she's wheezing for breath and trying to get help? When you're on your last dying breath, you're panicking, and gasping for air, not planning out a whole (not to mention, supernatural) revenge. How a child would even think of that is beyond me- Ellie was pretty young. She had her issues, but she was just a kid after all, what gave her the ability to create such a curse?\n2. After the cop is killed near the end of the film, we see an unfriendly spirit of Ellie approaching Beth (likely to kill her). We then see the saviour-looking spirit of Ellie's mother grab spirit-Ellie and pull her away from Beth, where we also see light (presented as the \"phone curse\") get sucked out of the dead cop's phone (which at this point would normally have already dialled the next victim) presumably putting an end to Ellie's cellular rampage. Yet once the spirit commotion is over, the late cop's phone dials the next victim's phone number. Why on Earth would you show a triumphant spirit, triumphantly end the curse, to only seconds later, just show the curse still active. Director just booked in a cheap ending.\n\nNevertheless, this movie still earns 3 stars as the premise was intriguing, and still fairly entertaining to watch despite the story problems. As far as horror movies go, there really is much worse than this.",

One Missed Call wasn't even smart enough to have a complex set of rules. And it wasn't brave enough to show us anything scary. They blew the entire budget pasting snapchat filters on harmless strangers walking by to spook our characters. The jumpscares were ridiculous and uneccesary. At one point a guy hands something to a character and they actually use a door slamming effect with loud music to try and squeeze another jumpscare in there. Because the movie has nothing else. They made a point to show us a scene where the main girl's professor was explaining childhood trauma because obvious foreshadowing. Then later she used her invaluable knowledge as a psych student to explain what Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy is to the detective because why would he know? Obviously they think the audience is ignorant and need this info explained. Boring, stupid, and cliche.",

There's always a sense of dread and a few jumpy shocks along the way, and these shocks are emphasised by some truly creepy imagery. I loved the scene when the first phone call comes through, the look on Shannyn Sossamon's and Azura Skye's faces are very convincing full of terror, this is a well constructed scene. One by one the characters are picked off in gruesome ways in a final destination sort of manner but this movie's gore isn't that effective. Although the characters aren't ones you care for, the cast's performance are quite good, but there are some short moments where the acting is a bit off key, a little life needs to be injected but I like the cast and the storyline creeps me out. I think Shannyn Sossamon is a great lead, I'd like to see more of her movies. You'd think because it's based on technology One Missed Call wouldn't be scary but it actually succeeds in giving the mobile phone a creepy vibe, or should I say tone.",

            "content": "It is a formula that has been employed by numerous films, many originating in Japan or some other Asian country. One Missed Call follows this formula to the letter, right down to the originating in Japan part. The only problem is that it seems to know we've seen it all before. The actors sleepwalk through their dialogue, and many times the hero of the story - a college student named Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), forgets to even react to the deaths of her friends. You see, all of Beth's friends are being killed off by a cursed cell phone voice mail message. It appears on your phone, and when you play it back, you hear the exact moment of your death. The friends are haunted by spooky visions of ghouls and decaying people walking around in broad daylight, until the character suddenly meets an untimely end in some sort of \"accident\" that makes me think the evil ghost in this movie took lessons from the ghastly spirit in the Final Destination films, as its method of killing people is somewhat similar. The Final Destination villain is much more flashier and complex in its killings, but you have to remember, the ghost in this movie is working under a much more restricted PG-13 rating, so you can't really blame it if its kills are not as bloody or grand.\nNow, let me ask you something here. If you knew that people were dying because of a mysterious voice message that appears on your cell phone, wouldn't you just try not listening to the voice message in the first place? This never dawns on Beth or her friends. They try smashing their cell phones to pieces, but this doesn't seem to halt the killer spirit's advances. I don't know if not listening to the message would save your life or not, but I figure if all of my friends were being killed after listening to it, I'd be willing to give it a shot. The movie continues down the expected path, and introduces our second hero, a police detective named Jack Andrews (Edward Burns). He's the only person who believes Beth's story about the cursed voice mail message, because his sister was a victim of it, too. They join forces to discover the truth behind the curse, and the clues fall right into place, leading them to a hospital that burned down a while ago. Everything that we saw happen in films like The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water, and the like happens, and not even the characters don't seem to be all that surprised. They go through the expected motions, and so does the movie itself.When I say One Missed Call follows a rigid path, I am dead serious. There's not one single moment we haven't seen in similar-themed movies. I have not seen the Japanese movie that inspired this remake, so I don't know if the original was as uninspired as this. I will give the original the benefit of the doubt that it had a lot more life and energy than this. The characters all seem to be walking a pre-determined path, and what's worse, they seem to know it. There's nothing worse than when the characters seem to be smarter than the movie they're in, but they're forced to act like idiots, because it's expected of them to do so. The movie doesn't even do a good job of explaining itself from time to time. I'm trying hard not to go into spoilers here, but should you see this movie (not that I'm recommending you do), ask yourself why the corpse they discover in the tunnels underneath the burnt hospital was there in the first place? Also ask yourself how many reality TV shows are filmed live? And wouldn't having someone die on your show live on national television kind of cause more attention than it seems to in this movie? My personal favorite moment of the movie actually comes early on, when the film's first victim meets an untimely end. The ghost then decides to not only kill her, but comes back for the victim's pet cat moments later. Did the cat get an eerie voice mail too? One Missed Call is the very definition of an early January release, a time of the year when the studios usually unload their stinkers that they don't know what to do with. The fact that it's the only new movie opening this weekend in wide release means that it will most likely find an audience with kids and teens looking for a cheap thrill. If you're bored this weekend, and actually consider this movie, please don't. This movie does not alleviate boredom, it only causes it.",

I don't know how it seems other reviewers say it's the worst US remake when it is practically the same movie.  \n\nWhen I started watching this movie I totally lost all hope for it.  It starts with a Japanese style house in the US, aside from Dave Spector making a cameo in the movie, I don't recall seeing any other Japanese related content, but the house seemed like the movie was trying to remind us, \"this story was originally from Japan\".  But I did quite enjoy the end of the scene, something a little more unexpected happens which you might expect to see at the end of a movie to be cliche.",

After the person is killed the ghost grabs a person randomly from their cell phone contacts and calls their phone. The call is this weird ringtone and is dated for a future day & time. When they check the message they hear their own voice and what they will be saying at the time of their death. Edward Burns plays a cop who's sister was the first victim so he is working with a group of college friends to try and find out who or what is doing this and how is it happening. I like Burns so I enjoyed him in this. The ending left me cold so that is the only major issue I have with it. All in all it's a good watch and got some good spooky moments.",

Not even the solid Edward Burns can make a dent in this one. All that being said, it is still, strangely, watchable. OMC is a remake of a 2004 Japanese film and even that version was critically panned. And I think that is the root of my dislike (not the critics, but this particular storytelling subgenre). A lot of Japanese horror (and, IMO, a disturbing trend in U.S. horror) ends with the evil continuing. I want the 'good guys' to have more than a fighting chance to win, I want a survivor to ride of into the sunset having vanquished evil. Scares are why we come but nihilism doesn't add realism or intensity, just pointlessness and depression.",

            "content": "\"One Missed Call\" is a complete mess of a horror film. It starts with a ridiculous premise: what if your mobile phone killed you? (an idea that has already become the subject of several parodies) and proceeds to run it into the ground. Basically, people receive a strange phone call where the sender leaves a message for them on their voice mail and it is dated from the future (for instance, if it was Thursday, they might get a call listed as Friday, 4:00 pm). Once you listen to the phone call, you realize that it's the sound of your upcoming death, which, despite your best efforts happens at the exact time of your voice mail. Your only hope to evade this fate is to go back to the beginning, using the hallucinations you receive as clues to figure out where the chain of deadly phone calls began.\n\nThe characters in the story react so casually to the events that are happening that you can't get invested in them or sucked into the story. You get some small glimpses of creepy distorted faces and there are a good amount of dead bodies in the end but if the victim's friends don't care, why should you? Like most movies based on Asian horror films, the story here is a mystery where the main character has to find the source of the curse in order to end the chain of events that threatens her. The idea with this type of tale is that as our main character Beth (Shannyn Sossamon) gets closer to the solution, the number of possible victims keeps getting smaller and smaller until she is trying to save herself or a few key characters by finally exposing some hidden truth or unleashing some kind of trapped spirit or something. Basically it gives us an explanation for why everything has been going on and she saves herself in the process. In this story the explanations for why phones are killing people are very loose and don't really make any sense. It actually gets downright silly when you see a dead body dialing a cell phone and the movie never makes its main characters act logically. There is one scene where we see a potential victim smash her phone and throw it away, which would be a logical thing to do, but everyone else feels like they're too attached to their phone contacts to actually try and intervene in the deadly chain of events. How stupid are these people?! We have established that the chain of deaths happens because the names of future victims are inside the phone of the previous ones... at least TRY and stop the murders by deleting numbers from your address book!\n\nThe film feels like a desperate attempt to make a concept that no matter how hard you tried, could never really be scary. There is a death at the very beginning of the film where someone dies, and they pet gets killed right after by the ghost and it makes absolutely no sense. Not only that the animal itself dies, but the way that it dies doesn't not match the explanation we get at the end of the movie at all. Well, unless it was one of those cats who likes to text people on their cellphones, I see those all the time in real life. The movie is PG-13 so even horror fans that can accept the thinnest of plots as long as they get their blood and nudity will be disappointed. With these limitations, you would think that this rating would direct the film into more suspense and unsettling imagery but there is only a tiny bit of those horror elements in the film. There are some great makeup effects towards the end of the story and this is where pretty much all of the excitement is concentrated. The more you think about the movie, the more it starts to fall apart and it becomes a ridiculous attempt at making a ghost horror movie. There's no reason to see \"One Missed Call\" instead of the many other superior Japanese horror ghost films that have emerged unless you really will get scared by anything and want an extremely tame horror film.

Sound bad to you?  One Missed Call is a terrible horror mystery flick.  It's an American remake of a 2003 Japanese film.  It's less horror and more horrible, lacking anything really scary, unless you count the script.  There are no real shocks or anything to make you jump either.  If you've seen some of my other reviews you'll know I'm not a big fan of PG-13 horror movies, there's only a handful I can stand.  The story is pretty lame and seems to rip off other horror films mostly the Final Destination series.  The cast is all ok for what they have to deal with including Shannyn Sossamon as our heroine Beth Raymond, Edward Burns as a detective, and Meagan Goode, Margaret Cho and Ariel Winter are some familiar names in the cast. I also found it amusing that this film has a 0 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.  If you come across One Missed Call somewhere, this is definitely one call you can miss!\r\n\r\nGets A-List Rating of: Suck It!\r\n\r\nSubscribe to me on Youtube at www.youtube.com/wesida15 Follow me on Facebook at www.facebook.com/westroopalist and on Twitter at www.twitter.com/wesalist",

This time instead of a video, it is a cell phone call you receive which comes from a dead person with your voice on it and date and time of death. In order to try to survive the call Beth (Shannyn Sossamon) who has already witnessed how three of her friends have died after receiving the phone call has to team up with the only police officer who beleives her story (Edward Burns, as to why he got involved with this film I still cant understand as he is a good actor). He believes her because her sister has recently died in a similar way but it seems no other cop is willing to help which is only natural in these movies. Together they will have to find a connection with these mysterious deaths and dont be suprised with the ending which also es very similar to the Ring. I didnt like this film which delivered very few scares if any. The visions which were supposed to be scary just seemed like normal people wearing bad halloween costumes. The only thing I will remember from this movie is the ringtone which I would like to have on my cell.

Once they've been marked, they see strange things like babies on fire, bugs crawling through people's skin, dolls wielding knives, men with pennies jammed up their noses, feet covered in bird feathers, dogs walking backwards, and other unsettling and fairly cliche horror shticks. When the victims finally die in gruesome but accidental ways, a hard candy is found in their mouth, a tattoo telling you where you left your bank card behind their ear..... okay, I'm getting a little bored with this. But honestly, it was just cram-packed with the dumbest, most unrelated visuals I've seen in any movie. The plot resolution isn't much more coherent either. I should have figured this is what I get for an early January release that sneak previews at 10PM on the evening before it opens, and your big name is Margaret Cho.\r\n\r\nI'm disappointed in this movie for a variety of reasons. Here's the rundown:\r\n\r\nAtlanta shot movie. I'd love to see good movies come out of Atlanta, but when this is what you associate with the film scene here, it's not much help. I will say the hospital set was absolutely beautiful. I didn't recognize it, but it has to be an abandonment in Atlanta.\r\n\r\nThe trailer was actually pretty good. I usually don't care for horror trailers, but this one was appealing in some way. That's rare for me.\r\n\r\nIt starred one of my new favorite actors, Shannyn Sossamon. She also starred in what was my favorite film of 2007 Wristcutters: A Love Story. She did as much as she could with it, so props Shannyn.\r\n\r\nOh, and for once I'd like to see college students living in a dumpy apartment with 9 other people, and not in lavish mansions by themselves. Who are these people? I'd kill them too.\r\n\r\nOne Missed Call is one painful ride. Save your time (thankfully my experience was free), and go see anything else.",

But then, I just decided to watch, and to my surprise, it wasn't too bad. I thought the film was borderline decent considering all the flack the film received. I thought the film was eerie and had a lot of atmosphere, which I liked, but it lacked in character development. The parts where it was supposed to very creepy were good, and did work, but they could've been done slightly better. I enjoyed Edward Burns in this film, and I thought for a remake, it had a few decent scares. But of course this remake doesn't even come close to the original. For what it is, One Missed Call is actually fairly decent, and manages to be quite fun, if you forget that this is indeed a remake. But like every other remake, it fails to capture the essence of the original, and like with every other remake this remake tries to outdo the original with fancy special effects. The film is decent, managing only a few good scares. But this isn't as bad as everyone has said it was. Though nothing will beat the original, this Americanized version is fairly entertaining and manages to be quite fun if you allow it to be. But don't go in expecting something great, go in with decent expectations, and you might like this.",

            "content": "1.0/10\r\n\r\n                      Nobody should be asked to watch a movie like the U.S. remake of \"One Missed Call\", just as nobody should be asked to make it. It's a movie that probably couldn't have worked as a remake, whether we liked it or not, but gosh, it could have at least been slick and mildly engaging. Why is it that so many of the worst movies I've ever seen end up coming out of the genre I favor the most? Maybe it's because all people care about these days is money; how much they make, how much people watch the thing, and how much stupid little teenagers want to squeal at it. And with \"One Missed Call\", if the teen crowd goes to be scared, then they will be.\r\n\r\n            The film is one missed opportunity. Within it are actors who have talent that they should not be wasting with this trifle, and better yet, there are also props and special effects that could have been used on a much better movie. Yeah, I get it; most horror movies are bad. But they have no right to be this bad. Here's a movie that goes against all genre rules, and doesn't give a damn about why I go to see horror films in the first place. It aims in the wrong areas, plays things \"PG-13 safe\", and misses oh so miserably.\r\n\r\n       The film is a remake of \"One Missed Call\"; that Takashi Miike horror movie from, I think, 2004, that I didn't even like. That movie alone was kind of a snooze-fest, but believe me, this film is even worse. A lot of the plot elements from the first film are dragged over to the remake, one thing which is, of course, the premise.\r\n\r\n     And this is a premise that you probably know of, since for some odd-freaking-reason, this movie was actually popular. The premise involves a ghostly ring-tone from beyond the grave that, when you pick up the phone, plays an audio clip/message (?) of your last few seconds before death.  The premise, as before, attempts to tackle the paranormal and the technological; and it tries to make a statement. The original film came pretty close, but didn't quite make the cut. And neither does the remake.\r\n\r\n       So just some of the victims, among others, are Beth (Shannyn Sossamon), Taylor (Ana Claudia Talancon), and Detective Jack (Edward Burns, who sounds like he has serious strep throat). These characters suffer hallucinations, one dying early on in the film due to the ring-tone of death reaching her cell. They see ghosts until they become their prey (since these ghosts do more than just stand there and stare at you).\r\n\r\n     The problem is not the premise. As I said with the first movie, the concept is OK. And I like what these \"One Missed Call\" flicks are trying to do, but message-making just doesn't come their way too well. Instead of something intelligent and creepy, we get a movie that is silly, dumb, and lame to the point where it's pretty much unwatchable. I can't imagine a single horror fan finding it scary let alone entertaining, and if you know anyone who admires it or thinks it is scary/creepy, then I suggest you either tell them to snap out of the trance, or to get new friends.\r\n\r\n     The film does not scare, and I do not scare easily. The whole thing is jump scene after jump scene, to the point where the film might as well be pleading for me to jump out of my seat and scream at its attempted \"Boo!\" moments. The ghosts that we see are products of special effects rather than the imagination, and this is the problem. That doesn't scare me, and it doesn't scare anybody who's actually seen a good horror movie in their lives. \r\n\r\n          As of now, the only good thing there is to mention about this excruciatingly bad attempt at a horror movie is a cat-death-scene, in which a defenseless feline is dragged underwater by a creepy hand. I feel bad for the cat for two reasons, (1.) because he just died, and (2.) because he had to suffer being in this mess of a movie. Poor kitten; poor movie.",

It starts off really without a decent explanation but you learn as the movie moves on which is good. The opening scene is just bold. Thats all I can say. Maybe its the scene in which the cat is pulled under the water that irritated a lot of people. And rarely do you see animals die in a movie unless its one of those \"Tale of a boy and his dog\". *Old Yeller* But thats besides the point. This movie just goes balls out and kills this cat. Beautiful.\r\nNow after that the girl is killed, nothing special. But then the whole concept comes out, your phone rings but you get this weird ring tone and it freaks you out. Of course you dont answer it, but it doesnt matter because your still going to die. The deaths were very interesting, and you wouldnt even begin to see it unless you seen this movie before. Its one of those movies that you just have to appreciate. If you want a movie that has an original idea that deals with something that pretty much everyone has in this world, i'd definitely watch this. It freaks you out a little if something could actually posses your cellular phone. Check it out because its a decent film with decent acting and which earns this film a 90%",

Then, Beth's roommate Taylor receives a call, but this time she teams up with a detective in order to investigate the connections between the victims, and try to save Taylor's life before the date she is supposed to die on. Having not seen the original film this is based on, I see One Missed Call as a new experience for me. The plot for this film sucks. Wait, sucks isn't the right word. Profanity is the only way I can express just how stupid it is. I'm supposed to be scared that I could receive a Voice Mail which would ultimately mean my death, just because I'm on someone's contact list. Bulls**t. Double Bulls**t. It's not a scary concept whatsoever; it almost seems like it's satirising another Horror idea. The reveal of the film is absolute crap too. It's revealed that it is a child who suffered an Asthma attack who started the curse. We're supposed to feel sorry for the child, but the plot gives us no real reason to because there's absolute no depth to the character whatsoever. If you want a death to mean something to the audience emotionally, give the character depth. When Nancy died in a Nightmare on Elm Street 3, it was a genuinely sad moment because it was a character that we had been shown and cared for before. In this, there's no reason to care. The film does that constantly, attempting to force us into having an emotional reaction. It's ridiculous to think that people are trying to force emotions onto us, and are expecting to get away with it. The only thing I can give the film credit for is that it doesn't give Gore or Nudity like most teenage horror films.\r\n\r\nThe acting in this film is awful, from every single cast member. Each member of the cast has poor delivery when it comes to the lines they are given, and when it comes to delivering the emotions, they either over-do it, or come off as monotone. It's painful to watch. There's no in particular cast member that does a worse job than the others.\r\n\r\nThe ending of the film is just the child trying to kill the main character, and it's hear where it really starts to pour on the CGI effects. How do you top off an uninteresting horror film? By making the CGI Special Effects terrible. Like most films that focus too strongly on CGI for the special effects, it's unconvincing and doesn't work well. It reminds me of the later part of 1408; the difference being that 1408, while eventually degenerating into a Special Effects Extravaganza, the effects were decent in that film.\r\n\r\nI've stated that the only compliment that I can give this film is that it doesn't have unnecessary Nudity and Gore. How ironic that the only good thing about it is something that it lacks. Do I need to spell it out any more? It's garbage. The End.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew's rating:\t0.5 out of 10",

To capture J-horror a) you must never give a complete explanation for a curse, things \"just happen\" and tragically there usually is no hope or formula for stopping it  b) the source of horror is only ever seen sparingly to increase efect when it does appear and c) curses signify actual social issues  or phobias (Ju-on > the rise of women against domestic violence, Pulse > phobia of technology, Ringu > intolerance, etc)    Stubbornly, the Americanized version goes totally against the principles above.

However, after a jam packed 15 minutes or so, we were soon whittled down to the sole survivor, before we even really got going. From this point onwards, the film took a whole new direction from something with potential, to something which loses my interest completely - a Japanese Psychological horror. This genre always baffles me within it's unrealistic plot, and i ended up having to use Wikipedia to unravel the mystery. Had this film ended with similarities to the 'Final Destination' series as opposed to 'The Grudge', then i'd probably be singing its praises having come away on a positive note but, alas, i left somewhat disappointed.",

There's always a sense of dread and a few jumpy shocks along the way, and these shocks are emphasised by some truly creepy imagery. I loved the scene when the first phone call comes through, the look on Shannyn Sossamon's and Azura Skye's faces are very convincing full of terror, this is a well constructed scene. One by one the characters are picked off in gruesome ways in a final destination sort of manner but this movie's gore isn't that effective. Although the characters aren't ones you care for, the cast's performance are quite good, but there are some short moments where the acting is a bit off key, a little life needs to be injected but I like the cast and the storyline creeps me out. I think Shannyn Sossamon is a great lead, I'd like to see more of her movies. You'd think because it's based on technology One Missed Call wouldn't be scary but it actually succeeds in giving the mobile phone a creepy vibe, or should I say tone.",

The characters themselves are very forgettable and aren't really on the screen long enough before they get taken out - as such the film becomes predictable which, for a horror, can be VERY boring. \nOverall, it's good enough to have on and keep thge average viewer mildy entertained but any horror fan will find it predictable and disapointing.",
