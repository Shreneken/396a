The behind-the-scenes look at how WWE-style wrestling is practiced is sharply observed and detailed.

Mickey Rourke is Randy ‘The Ram' Robinson, a former professional wrestling champ twenty years past his prime, forced to perform in school gyms and community centers to make ends meet, all while trying to reestablish a relationship with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood).  Marisa Tomei is Cassidy, a middle-aged stripper, well past her prime, who, due to her age, struggles to arrange private dances with her clientele.  Rourke gives the best performance of his career as a man who is unable to establish meaningful connections with others, relying on his wrestling persona to mask his lack of identity.  Aronofsky shoots the film through the lens of a handheld camera, an almost documentary vibe, following his deeply flawed protagonist through his daily grind, seeing the world as ‘The Ram' see it, cold and distant and cruel.  It's difficult to watch at times, but important to see.",

            "content": "When your life is a character, how do you deal with the curtain falling?\n\nMickey Rourke has had a strange career. It seems like even when he was on top he was never really taken seriously (his '80s work and boxing career are all but forgotten today), but his turn as aging wrestling legend Randy 'The Ram' Robinson changed all that. As a former superstar that sacrificed virtually every other aspect of his life - romance, friends, and a graceful exit - to give life for a little while longer to his persona, finding his body aging means more than an involuntary retirement, it's a reckoning with a lifetime of shortsighted choices. Rourke embodies that emotional jumble well, delivering a combination of genuine remorse and hope that ends up dragged down by personality features that are simply too established by this point to change, even if they are to his own detriment.\n\nThe story is simple but powerful, ably told by screenwriter Robert Siegel (who has a grand total of six writing credits, two of which are The Onion Movie and Turbo, if you can figure out that genre clash) but brought to life by the capable direction of Aronofsky, who tones down his typically morbid psychological elements a bit but retains his love for the moderately disturbing with a depiction of aging and obsession  that feels empathetic despite the highly targeted setting and characters. Great cinematography is a must for the director at this point, and The Wrestler is no exception; it's framed beautifully.\n\nNext time I see a deli slicer, I'm sure there will be some flashbacks. That was some Jeanne Dielman shit. (3.5/5)",

It is a deeply sad and realistic portrait of loneliness and is in no way an easy film to get through. However, it is still fascinating and boosted by such strong work from all of the actors involved, that I completely think it is worth watching.

            "content": "It looks as though Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler has become more of a comeback vehicle for its star Mickey Rourke, than anything else, and deservingly so, as the former \"it guy\" mounts one of the most refreshing revivals in recent years.\n\nRourke, 52, is cast as Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson, a mullet-sporting professional wrestler who reached his peak back in the Eighties, though this film focuses on the man two decades after his glory days. This older Randy Robinson is battered and beaten, physically and emotionally, alone in a bitter shadow of himself. He still wrestles, but with fellow has-been's, at smaller venues, and for paycheques that has him moonlighting at a local deli and living in a run-down trailer just to make ends meet.\n\nRobinson is victorious only when he steps into the ring, to partake in low-key, premeditated fighting matches, which results in a near-fatal heart attack. When Robinson is forced to retire from wrestling he temporarily--and half-heartedly--rekindles his relationship with his only daughter (played by Evan Rachel Wood), and finds solace in a kinship with a local stripper, played by Oscar-winning Marisa Tomei. Rourke and Tomei's characters are steadily similar, as lost souls and single parents who degrade themselves to entertain others, parading around onstage, near-naked, performing worn-out routines for what seems like spare change. That is why they always seem to come back to one another, when no one else gives a damn.\n\nThe movie culminates in a 20th anniversary rematch that a destitute Robinson can't turn down, despite the risk to his ailing heart. But before we find out whether \"The Ram\" triumphs over his opponent or succumbs to the one thing that truly makes him come alive, Aronofsky pulls the plug and the credits begin to roll, leaving us only to guess. Perhaps we're better off.\n\nThe role was made for Rourke to play, reminding us of his real-life struggles that had him almost obsolete amongst the Hollywood elite. Like Robinson, Rourke's heydays were in the Eighties, with memorable roles in hit movies like Diner (1982), Rumble Fish (1983), and Nine and a Half Weeks (1986). But filmmaking was put on the backburner when Rourke took up semi-pro boxing in the Nineties, using Guns 'N Roses' \"Sweet Child O'Mine\" as his entrance song, just as Robinson does in The Wrestler. In 2005 a delapitated Rourke returned to his prime with a lead role in the cult favourite Sin City, and then took center stage with last year's The Wrestler. Earlier this month Rourke's resurrection earned the aging actor a Golden Globe statuette for Best Actor, perhaps his most deserved honour since winning a Worst Actor Razzie Award for 1991's Wild Orchid.\n\nLooking back at The Wrestler I couldn't help noticing its semi-autobiographical story, pulling Robinson and Rourke together so that ends could finally meet, by breaking away from the standard sports films to deliver its point. The only thing standing in the way of giving this movie a perfect rating was not knowing what happens with \"The Ram\" in the end, although this same reason is why I avoided giving it a '4-out-of-5' as well.\n\nSometimes its the not-knowing that leaves us content and settled, a feeling I left with when The Wrestler ended, with none other than Bruce Springsteen setting the tone with one of his melancholy rock ballads. Now lets just pray Rourke will build on this role, bending the bar with stories that comebacks are made of.",

Randy \"The Ram\" lives in a trailer, struggles to find work outside of wrestling, has a daughter who disowns him and struggles with health issues (namely heart related) due to the strenuous lifestyle of pro wrestling and all the drugs he's consumed while in the industry.

Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke), washed-up wrestler, seeks to reclaim his lost splendor and restore his relationship with his daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) to gain a sense of purpose in The Wrestler. However, the road to recovery is paved with repentance, regret and low-paying backyard wrestling gigs in front of crowds no more than thirty. What makes The Wrestler compelling, above all else, is its innate ability to capture a man at his most desperate without teetering into melodrama. Filmed in a way that almost makes it look like a documentary, it chronicles the uniquely human search for redemption through fame, fortune, and in Randy's case, second chances at stardom. The story acts as an allegory for Mickey Rourke's own personal life and career-being a professional boxer himself and falling from the limelight-adding an unexpected complexity to the narrative. Director Darren Aronofsky's steady fingers draw deeply personal, yet subtle pain from Rourke, flooding the screen with genuine emotion and one of the best performances in over a decade. Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood also provide excellent supporting acts that highlight the tragic, unflinching character flaws of Randy the Ram's psyche. You root for him despite his continuous narcissistic choices and vicious cycle he thrusts upon himself that leave him loveless and alone, and it ultimately culminates in a beautifully metaphorical ending about our incessant drive for recognition as human beings.",

It is somewhat of a palindrome to \"Rocky\", but it has its own personality that comes alive through Rourke's gut wrenching performance. The background score is aptly scored with up lifting songs, decent cinematography and perfect editing. \n\nTicking for around 100 minutes, the tale soaks up every emotional combat of protagonist's life. Siegel's narration isn't of a newer structure and webs out a safer play, but within its familiarity, it is thoroughly competent. The storytelling is elaborative and enthralling with a rhythmic beats that elevates the momentum of the sequences and glorifies each tiny notions. \n\nAs mentioned earlier the performance objective is more than safe with Rourke on driver seat amping up the tale, alongwith Tomei's another mature and stable performance. Aronofsky is in his A game, flaunting his skills with such panache that his bubble doesn't seem fictitious at all, it's like the staged wrestling that Rourke does in here, but this time the audience hassled, is us. \n\nThere aren't much verbal sparrings in this busy world, the props are used wisely along with all the all the physical sequences to speak volume and advance the plotline. The build up of all the leaps and eerie decisions that each characters make, the conversations are impressive, Tomei's inspiring track, the inner world of wrestling and Rourke's heartwarming performance are the high points of the feature. \n\nThe Wrestler is a challenging eye popping tale to convey the message it actually wraps and its Aronofsky and his equally invested cast that makes it worth listening to.",

            "content": "It's official. I just don't get Hollywood. \n\nTonight I watched Mickey Rourke's highly-touted comeback (although I consider his perfect performance as Marv in Sin City as a more appropriate example of his comeback) in The Wrestler. While his performance is phenomenal, Sean Penn deserved the Oscar. I'm glad I saw both performances and feel good that the best man won.\n\nIn any case, The Wrestler itself is an interesting case study in the whole Hollywood scene.\n\nSaturated with near-flawless performances from underrated actors, and filmed in a superb, gritty, honest and raw manner, The Wrestler had the makings of another Raging Bull. Where it lost its way, however, is in the script and, in some way, the directing.\n\nDon't get me wrong. The Wrestler is a good movie. And I would rather watch it a hundred times than endure Benjamin Button again. However, it has some very basic flaws that, amazingly, have gone nearly unnoticed in most reviews I've read. Luckily there are a few out there who saw the same movie I did, but it begs the question of how in the world do seasoned film critics miss the basics? How can someone give this movie 4 stars when it breaks the simplest of film making rules??\n\nFor the first hour of this nearly two-hour film is perfect. Shot in a documentary style, with very little scripted dialogue, what the viewer is exposed to is the seedy underbelly of the wrestling world. What a miserable existence is portrayed. Emotionally, the viewer IMMEDIATELY connects with what the people/characters are doing, why they do it, etc. It's sad. It's pathetic. It's depressing as hell.\n\nThen, the main character, Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson, has a heart attack, which requires a bypass and immediate retirement. Understandably, Randy's miserable existence as a washed up wrestler, compounded by this sudden health problem, which only exacerbates his miserable existence, would lead to introspection and making amends for any wrongdoing in his life. \n\nBut here is where the movie loses me.\n\nI've been sucked in. I'm THERE. I am completely following, understanding and sympathizing with Randy. I'm even following why he would want to make amends. I'm even there when he initially approaches a long-lost daughter, who is not mentioned at all until his heart attack. And then suddenly a movie that is all about developing the emotional connection between the audience and the characters through exposure to reality, suddenly turns into a movie with a lot of sappy dialogue that heavily forces the viewer to shift from a reality-based understanding, to a manufactured one. One that is clearly script-driven and over-Hollywood, when much of the dialogue up until now has almost been banter-like and ad-libbed. Very natural to almost unnatural.\n\nLike Benjamin Button, it's these forced mechanics that drive me, as a viewer INSANE.\n\nThe movie still has very incredible moments throughout the rest of the film, mostly performance-driven. At no point can I say that Mickey and Marisa are not good in this film. They are amazing. It's just that the script lingers far too close to Leaving Las Vegas and Rocky to feel too good about the power of this story.\n\nReview after review that I've read focus heavily on the performances and the sadness of the story. And those are all very true. The Wrestler is just very clumsily written. And there is nothing that the director does to correct it.\n\nIt's clear that the purpose of this movie is not only to show the grittiness of the whole wrestling scene, but also show how desperate a man can get when everything seems to go wrong for him. That is why it puzzled me beyond belief why the director would entice me, emotionally, into feeling a certain way and feeding it to me in a specific way, then decide to tug harder on my heart, but with weak, forced dramatic situations, completely opposite of the first hour.\n\nThe pivotal scene for me in the movie is when, after failing to reconcile with his daughter right after his heart attack, he eventually talks her into going to the beach in Jersey with him. Suddenly, a daughter we never heard anything about, and his memories of her as a child that we had never heard anything about, are supposed to mean so much to us as a viewer that we are to get sucked into his and her emotional pain. \n\nWell, I had an hour to develop feelings about him as a wrestler. And I had 5 minutes to care about this father/daughter relationship. I just didn't buy it. Randy's \"confession\" about how he is a busted up piece of meat is corny, but I'm still with the movie up until this point, though squirming in my seat. The final straw was, as they walk up and down the beach and its abandoned buildings, we are shown a scene where the daughter is walking slightly behind Randy. Then we are forced to see her looking off to the side in deep thought, then speed up to catch up with Randy and hug his arm. \n\nThis scene made me sigh aloud. \n\nA movie that had been so real, suddenly turned into a fake Hollywood film.\n\nLuckily the movie saves most of itself by showing Randy disappoint his daughter again, take her harsh words to him as a complete fuck up to heart, then make the decision within himself to just go back to wrestling, despite his delicate heart, because he can't really do anything else and he doesn't care anymore if he lives or dies. He really doesn't have anything else for which to live.\n\nI like The Wrestler. I really did. It's just that the same emotional connection between two hard-luck characters, void of a moral compass, who find each other and are kindreds, was very much done more perfectly in Leaving Las Vegas. Because it WAS handled so perfectly, the structural flaw in The Wrestler was just too blatantly obvious. And the washed up athlete trying to get back on top has just been done, with a lot more perfection, in movies like Raging Bull and Rocky. \n\nThe movie was tailor made for Rourke though, and it is a wonderful example of how much talent he has. The best thing about this movie is that we will probably be seeing a lot more of him. I just wish Hollywood and up-and-coming film makers will try a little harder when attempting a film of this emotional caliber.",

            "content": "From the beginning of The Wrestler I was frustrated and convinced this movie was not going to be for me at all. I’ve never totally understood professional wrestling and why it’s a draw, and watching someone destroying his body and his life in such a disturbing way was just painful. I couldn’t get on board with Mickey Rourke at all as a protagonist. It also didn’t help that this was shot almost in a found-footage documentary style, so there’s tons of shaky handheld camera work that annoys me. Also there isn’t a traditional story setup or any exposition, we’re just dropped into this world already in motion and expected to get up to speed fast, which isn’t difficult but can be a bit jarring at first. But there is a turning point for The Wrestler. At a certain point of the film, events force him to face his own mortality and it affects him deeply. This worked so well and transitioned a standoffish character, who I struggled to sympathize with, into something else. I suddenly found him respectable, and was worried about him. His interactions with the women in his life were powerful and heartbreaking. Marisa Tomei delivered a performance that became more impressive as the story progressed. Her first scene just led me to roll my eyes when I realized we were getting the same old stupid strip club scene that 90% of movies include. So for Tomei to turn a character I hated seeing in the beginning, into a vital part of the plot that I actually liked seeing, was a big deal. The climax was tough for me. I don’t want to spoil anything for others, but it was hard to deal with some of the things that end up happening after I have formed even a small amount of attachment to the protagonist. The Wrestler is a well-told story that feels tremendously authentic. I’m not sure if this is based on a true story, but that’s how it comes across. Sadly, I don’t particularly like elements of the life story shown here. It’s set in a world I don’t love, and shot in a style I don’t like, and includes events that irritate me. It’s actually surprising to me, in retrospect, how much I did appreciate about The Wrestler. It somehow worked relatively well despite all my reservations. I can’t see myself watching it again, but I might be willing if asked because the heart in the film was powerful. ",

Maybe I am a little bias because of the fact that I am a wrestling fan, and as I have gotten older I have become really interested in reading books by older wrestlers about the life and behind the scenes outlook on the business. So I went into this film knowing a lot about the subject and felt I would be a good judge if it matched up to something authentic or something that was rather silly, and the former was the case with The Wrestler. Other than a pretty cool role in Sin City, Mickey Rourke's career was all but over. But wow did they hit the nail on the head casting him in this role, its perfect. I cannot see any other actor being able to pull this role off now that its all said and done. Not only was he great at the acting part of it, but physically he looked the part. From his body to his old battered face. Through reading the books and watching documentaries on the real life of wrestlers this movie really cannot get more authentic. And the fact that real pro wrestlers endorsed this movie gives it an even higher mark in my book. Because most pro wrestlers are very reluctant to endorse anything from outside the business. Rourke gives the performance of his career here. And I will continue to say it, in my opinion him not getting the Oscar for Best Actor is the one of the biggest all time snubs in Oscar history. He lost to Sean Penn for Milk, really ? Even Penn mentioned Rourke in his acceptance speech, probably knowing that he didn't deserve it. It was a good performance, sure, but not even close to Rourke's performance in The Wrestler. But that year the Oscars were all over the place. Slum dog Millionaire won for Best Picture, a movie that was pretty much forgotten after that night. The Dark Knight was the best movie of that year, but god forbid the academy votes for a superhero movie. But this isn't the place to debate Oscar wins and losses.

Rourke gives the performance of his career here.  And I will continue to say it, in my opinion him not getting the Oscar for Best Actor is the one of the biggest all time snubs in Oscar history.  He lost to Sean Penn for Milk, really ?  Even Penn mentioned Rourke in his acceptance speech, probably knowing that he didn't deserve it.  It was a good performance, sure, but not even close to Rourke's performance in The Wrestler.  But that year the Oscars were all over the place.  Slum dog Millionaire won for Best Picture, a movie that was pretty much forgotten after that night. The Dark Knight was the best movie of that year, but god forbid the academy votes for a superhero movie.  But this isn't the place to debate Oscar wins and losses.  The Wrestler is a fantastic movie with fantastic performances and a great story.",

            "content": "The most straight laced tale Aronofsky has created thus far, The Wrestler, sees a career revival in Mickey Rourke as Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson and also gets Aronofsky noticed by the academy. The Ram is an aged and washed up professional wrestler, his glory days long behind him, with only a cult following remaining. When Randy suffers a stroke, he tries to reconnect with his family and start a new life with a stripper called Cassidy, but his life style and the ring's calling is too hard to ignore. It's a wonderfully simplistic tale, one that takes the much frowned upon topic of wrestling and showcases the hardships behind staying relevant, in a ravenous industry. Much like Black Swan, The Wrestler is a dedicated character piece and much like Black Swan, Mickey Rourke hammers home his best performance, with a scarily resonate portrayal of his own career. Refusing to come across as your typical sports movie, The Wrestler, offers an upsetting insight into Randy's life, he struggles to keep regular payments on his rent, he cant perform without a vast array of drugs, his only form of connection is with an aging stripper, who ironically fights a similar battle. It's not exactly uplifting stuff, however it offers a more bleak and desperate look into a world that is so often glamorized, by big budget film making, Rocky this is not. The cast all do a stupendous job, holding back and giving a more personal and human performance. Rourke couldnt be better cast, Marissa Tomei is terrific as Cassidy and Evan Rachel Wood gives a brief but harrowing performance as Randy's daughter. Aronofsky also strips back his visual flair, making each movement and action raw and personal, the actual fight sequences have a huge weight behind them, shattering the illusion that wrestlers never harm each other. It's a brilliant and stripped back movie, that does for indie films what The Matrix done for action films. There isnt much to be critical about, yes its not a big, flashy film with an everything will be okay attitude, but it offers a much more realistic look of a genre that has clearly reused its stereotypes. A raw and powerful slice of cinema, that any stone hearted person would struggle to not be effected by.",

            "content": "The Wrestler is a powerful and heart-wrenching character study, featuring a captivating performance from Mickey Rourke as a struggling, washed-up wrestler. Aronofsky's direction is masterful in its measured pacing and simplicity, mirroring Rourke's beautifully subtle performance as he too is able to convey so much depth and complexity without ever needing to do too much. Following the days of retired pro-wrestler Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson as he tries to get by, connect with people as well as repair a broken relationship with his daughter, The Wrestler provides a raw and intense look at a life defined by sorrow and regret. Given its simple story, the pressure really falls upon Rourke's shoulders to carry the film, and he delivers with one of the most affecting and genuine performances I have ever seen. With The Wrestler, Aronofsky's subdued and nuanced direction is able to showcase one of the greatest modern performances from Mickey Rourke, immersing the audience within the vulnerability, heartache, loneliness and regret of a man at the end of his rope. For what it sets out to be and for what it manages to convey, The Wrestler is as close to a perfect film as I believe it gets.",

Rourke absolutely nailed this role. The anguish he often expressed as Robinson felt real and sometimes vaguely familiar. When he couldn't depend on the crowd's adoration, he turned to a stripper (Marisa Tomei), and his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) to fill that void. These relationships provided raw, emotional and well-acted scenes, but I felt that the romance's arc was a tad predictable. Also, while the initial father-daughter meeting was a highlight, I wanted to learn a little more about their past. Darren Aronofsky's directing was also superb. Several silent scenes held substantial weight and I enjoyed all the little ways we were told that Robinson just couldn't leave wrestling behind from the bobblehead on his dashboard, to his refusal to be called by his real name, to owning an ancient wrestling video game that, of course, features him competing in his prime. Everyone will find something to like. As a wrestling fan, I enjoyed the movie's portrayal of the sport because it showed its brutality and what these men are willing to go through to entertain the crowd. As a sports fan, it was beyond sad watching this athlete cling to the past. As a human, watching Robinson's battle to not be alone truly hit home. \"The Wrestler\" is definitely worth watching.",

There is a lot of time spend at the club, and therefore plenty of strippers, and is the single most used set for the film.

I just don't get Hollywood. \n\nTonight I watched Mickey Rourke's highly-touted comeback (although I consider his perfect performance as Marv in Sin City as a more appropriate example of his comeback) in The Wrestler.  While his performance is phenomenal, Sean Penn deserved the Oscar.  I'm glad I saw both performances and feel good that the best man won.\n\nIn any case, The Wrestler itself is an interesting case study in the whole Hollywood scene.\n\nSaturated with near-flawless performances from underrated actors, and filmed in a superb, gritty, honest and raw manner, The Wrestler had the makings of another Raging Bull.  Where it lost its way, however, is in the script and, in some way, the directing.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  The Wrestler is a good movie.  And I would rather watch it a hundred times than endure Benjamin Button again.  However, it has some very basic flaws that, amazingly, have gone nearly unnoticed in most reviews I've read.  Luckily there are a few out there who saw the same movie I did, but it begs the question of how in the world do seasoned film critics miss the basics?  How can someone give this movie 4 stars when it breaks the simplest of film making rules??\n\nFor the first hour of this nearly two-hour film is perfect.  Shot in a documentary style, with very little scripted dialogue, what the viewer is exposed to is the seedy underbelly of the wrestling world.  What a miserable existence is portrayed.  Emotionally, the viewer IMMEDIATELY connects with what the people/characters are doing, why they do it, etc.  It's sad.  It's pathetic.  It's depressing as hell.\n\nThen, the main character, Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson, has a heart attack, which requires a bypass and immediate retirement.  Understandably, Randy's miserable existence as a washed up wrestler, compounded by this sudden health problem, which only exacerbates his miserable existence, would lead to introspection and making amends for any wrongdoing in his life. \n\nBut here is where the movie loses me.\n\nI've been sucked in.  I'm THERE.  I am completely following, understanding and sympathizing with Randy.  I'm even following why he would want to make amends.  I'm even there when he initially approaches a long-lost daughter, who is not mentioned at all until his heart attack.  And then suddenly a movie that is all about developing the emotional connection between the audience and the characters through exposure to reality, suddenly turns into a movie with a lot of sappy dialogue that heavily forces the viewer to shift from a reality-based understanding, to a manufactured one.  One that is clearly script-driven and over-Hollywood, when much of the dialogue up until now has almost been banter-like and ad-libbed.  Very natural to almost unnatural.\n\nLike Benjamin Button, it's these forced mechanics that drive me, as a viewer INSANE.\n\nThe movie still has very incredible moments throughout the rest of the film, mostly performance-driven.  At no point can I say that Mickey and Marisa are not good in this film.  They are amazing.  It's just that the script lingers far too close to Leaving Las Vegas and Rocky to feel too good about the power of this story.\n\nReview after review that I've read focus heavily on the performances and the sadness of the story.  And those are all very true.  The Wrestler is just very clumsily written.  And there is nothing that the director does to correct it.\n\nIt's clear that the purpose of this movie is not only to show the grittiness of the whole wrestling scene, but also show how desperate a man can get when everything seems to go wrong for him.  That is why it puzzled me beyond belief why the director would entice me, emotionally, into feeling a certain way and feeding it to me in a specific way, then decide to tug harder on my heart, but with weak, forced dramatic situations, completely opposite of the first hour.\n\nThe pivotal scene for me in the movie is when, after failing to reconcile with his daughter right after his heart attack, he eventually talks her into going to the beach in Jersey with him.  Suddenly, a daughter we never heard anything about, and his memories of her as a child that we had never heard anything about, are supposed to mean so much to us as a viewer that we are to get sucked into his and her emotional pain. \n\nWell, I had an hour to develop feelings about him as a wrestler.  And I had 5 minutes to care about this father/daughter relationship.  I just didn't buy it.  Randy's \"confession\" about how he is a busted up piece of meat is corny, but I'm still with the movie up until this point, though squirming in my seat.  The final straw was, as they walk up and down the beach and its abandoned buildings, we are shown a scene where the daughter is walking slightly behind Randy.  Then we are forced to see her looking off to the side in deep thought, then speed up to catch up with Randy and hug his arm. \n\nThis scene made me sigh aloud. \n\nA movie that had been so real, suddenly turned into a fake Hollywood film.\n\nLuckily the movie saves most of itself by showing Randy disappoint his daughter again, take her harsh words to him as a complete fuck up to heart, then make the decision within himself to just go back to wrestling, despite his delicate heart, because he can't really do anything else and he doesn't care anymore if he lives or dies.  He really doesn't have anything else for which to live.\n\nI like The Wrestler.  I really did.  It's just that the same emotional connection between two hard-luck characters, void of a moral compass, who find each other and are kindreds, was very much done more perfectly in Leaving Las Vegas.  Because it WAS handled so perfectly, the structural flaw in The Wrestler was just too blatantly obvious.  And the washed up athlete trying to get back on top has just been done, with a lot more perfection, in movies like Raging Bull and Rocky. \n\nThe movie was tailor made for Rourke though, and it is a wonderful example of how much talent he has.  The best thing about this movie is that we will probably be seeing a lot more of him.  I just wish Hollywood and up-and-coming film makers will try a little harder when attempting a film of this emotional caliber.",

            "content": "The Wrestler is directed by Darren Aronofsky, and it stars Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei, and Evan Rachel Wood in a sports drama about a wrestler that has been wrestling for a long time, and after a recent heart attack that almost killed him, Randy (Mickey Rourke) wanted to get his life back together, whether it be financial wise, and family. With his next film mother! coming next week, I wanted to watch one of his films that I haven't reviewed, and with this being on my DirecTV list, I figure I should watch this and see how it is. Mickey Rourke is born to play this type of character as he's perfect as a wrestler that is very well known, has his signature moves, and is very likable with everybody, which I didn't know when watching the film that Mickey Rourke was actually a boxer at one time. Marisa Tomei was very believable as a stripper that I think she's very much brace for showing the body bare while dancing very sensual for the people inside the strip club. I like the chemistry between Randy and Pam as it seems genuine and very odd as you wouldn't expect someone like those two to have a heart to heart conversation. Even though Evan Rachel Wood isn't in it that much, she's still great in what's she in, and she has some emotional moments that are done well. The one main aspect that separates this from the other wrestling films, is that it focuses more on the characters than the fighting scenes. Now there's no lack thereof for the fighting scenes as there are a few of them, they are enjoyable to watch that you're having just as much fun as the audience is, and you see how they do their own wrestling that while it's all the act, they have fun with it while doing some real good damage to each other. This is basically a character-driven film with some wrestling aspects to it, and the writing by Robert D. Siegel, with maybe a few rewrites from the director and Mickey Rourke himself, is fantastic that brings it down to some actual human conversations that seem very laid back, but not in a boring way. Even the direction by Darren Aronofsky is interesting in that this is different from the weird and creepy stuff that he has done before, and it really felt like I was watching a documentary about a fictional character that felt real to me. The only time where it might be starting to become a movie is in the last 20 minutes of it, but it never seem to betray the documentary aspect as we understand why he's doing this, and the direction and writing still remain strong. The Wrestler is probably my favorite wrestling film, and for me, one of Darren Aronofsky's best because the movie felt so human to me, which is what the best films should be to my personal taste in one of those aspects, and I think this is a masterpiece.",

The Wrestler is simple, but finds a way to do a damn good job telling the story, and providing a hard emotional punch.\n\nRandy 'The Ram' Robinson used to be one of the biggest wrestling icons of the 1980's. He garnered a whole fan base of dedicated Americans who were crazy for the ram. It's now many years later, and Randy is doing small community gigs, fighty no name guys, just trying to keep it up and put on a show. With the experimentation of drugs, combined with the heavy physical activities involved, Randy has a serious health scare, being warned to quit wrestling if he wants to live. It all hits Randy like a brick wall, that he nearly came that close to death. Once he's left wrestling, he decides he must resolve the burdening issues in the relationship with his daughter, as well as impress a woman who may or may not really care about him. He's old, washed up, and hopeless, just trying to figure out what it is that's he's good for at this stage in the game.\n\nFirst off, the whole movie is anchored by Rourke. It's a one man show, and he's unbelievable. Seriously, he has crafted one of the most real, believable characters in a movie in the last decade. He slips into the role perfectly, and gives us a guy who's battered and bruised, physically and emotionally, and it's all very believable. When you can get your whole audience to buy into your character like that, it's awesome. Rourke's performance as The Ram is easily one of the more notable Oscar snubs that have happened in recent history, and now I understand why. Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood are also solid, for the smaller parts they have. Even though they have lesser parts, they also play their parts perfectly, unfortunately overshadowed by Rourke's juggernaut performance. Acted and executed so well in terms of performance, The Wrestler is a fine example of a movie that is actually perfectly cast to a tee. Not many movies have the ability to make that claim, but in my opinion it fits in that selective bunch.\n\nThe next big components is the direction and cinematography, which fits so well, thanks to Aronofsky. With Aronofsky's previous work, we're used to nightmarish trips with no escape. With The Wrestler, instead we are given a bleak, emotional, character study that doesn't really make use of those surreal elements from Pi, Requiem For a Dream, or the Fountain. It's always interesting to see a director step out of his zone, and try a new film on, and Aronofsky flourishes here. It's easy to see why soon Aronofsky may rank up with the greats. If not for his excellent storytelling ability, but for his surprising versatility as a director. The Wrestler is one of the few movies I've watched lately, that I already want to re-watch.\n\nThe Wrestler is a bleak, hard hitting character study, that benefits from a great directorial approach and a once in a life time performance from the Rourke.",

Combined with a mostly hand-held camera that follows Randy through his life. Just as he sets out on a comeback trail leading up to a big reunion fight with his old arch-nemesis, Randy suffers a heart attack that puts everything on hold. Randy tries to accept it gracefully, taking on more hours at the grocery store and re-connecting with a daughter he'd pretty much abandoned years ago. You root for him; you want him to turn his life around. But old habits die hard. Randy means well but can't quite take that final step out of the limelight. In the last act of the movie, he decides to go for that one last comeback performance, just weeks after open-heart surgery. The film builds a beautiful sense of dread as you hope he comes to his senses but fear that he won't.\n\nGritty, realistic, and totally absorbing, this movie is magnificent.",

Although it is clear he has made some terrible decisions in life, the genuineness of his character makes him incredibly likable.

Her struggle to connect with a person she loves is very organic and true to life. Both characters clearly wanted an avenue out of their demeaning jobs due to fear of being snubbed completely. They seemed a good pair to rise from their tumultuous pasts. \n\nAs with many Aronofsky films, some scenes are hard to watch.

But simply because by the time \"The Wrestler\" ends, we--the audience--have experienced a painful, tear-jerking train-wreck that is Randy the Ram's journey. I've never shared this outside of a few people, but I was a huge wrestling fan (I'm not too into it now but it still has my respect) for a long time, if anything, this film has made appreciate the sport even more. The ONLY time wrestling's fake is when the matches' outcomes and storylines are taken into consideration; outside of that, the bumps (impact, whatever you want to call it), the constant traveling, the time away from one's family, etc is all very real. On top of that is the company's pressure to make its roster [literally] look like true competition. In other words, a champion has to not only be over with the fans, they have to LOOK like a champion. I'm hinting at steroids when I typed that. But that's going off topic although that aspect is kind of explored in the film. Mickey Rourke is the heart and soul of \"The Wrestler\"--a role which he takes up so well that we forget that Randy the Ram is not a real character. There's enough action to earn the approval of movie fans who find drama to boring and enough emotion to inject itself into the soft side of the toughest SOB on the planet. I was more moved by the film's more tender moments, maybe some that might appear as insignificant. Like when Randy is forced to retire from wrestling, he walks into the deli section to work and before going out, he hears the chants of an explosive crowd only to find a lack of adrenaline in what he's been forced to do because wrestling has taken a toll on him by this point in the film. There are other examples but that one stood out to me, the director was a genius to not let us into Randy's mind but to show us through certain actions how he felt. Everything was perfectly crafted in \"the Wrestler\" and ultimately (no matter how many times I watch it) it's one of the best films I've ever seen (and I truly mean that this time).",

Requiem For A Dream chronicled the lives of addicts (specifically drug addicts) as their lives fell deeper down an irreversible downward spiral.  The Fountain (2006) crossed the lines of science fiction and history as it told the story of one man (Hugh Jackman) in three of his different lives through time as he attempted to reach nirvana.  In 2008, he directed The Wrestler which is considered by Aronofsky to be a companion film to his psychological-horror film about ballet entitled Black Swan (2010).\n Starring Mickey Rourke as Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson and Marisa Tomei as a stripper known as Cassidy, both characters embody similar roles in one of the overarching themes of the film.  Cassidy is a mother of a nine year old and is considered by many of the clients to be too old regardless of her physical shape and presence as a stripper.  Similarly, Randy is in his late fifties with a great history of success as a professional wrestler in the 1980s, but now that he is back in the realm of wrestling he is beginning to realize that he can't handle all of the physical stress (even though he has every spectator's admiration as a veteran in the wrestling industry).\n The Wrestler is, by far, Darren Aronofsky's greatest film to date as it blends drama and action with grace and brutality and is gripping to viewers who may regard wrestling as \"dirty\" or \"unsophisticated\" (especially in comparison to Black Swan which is set in the realm of beauty and sophistication).\n One of the greatest challenges in dramatic filmmaking is crossing the line of melodrama (a problem that a few of Aronofsky's past films have suffered from), but The Wrestler captures a vivid picture of reality in this fictional tale.  Everything from the daughter that Randy abandoned in the 80s (Evan Rachel Wood), to Cassidy's friendship with her frequent client Randy; The Wrestler is a beautiful depiction of life with flawed people who have deep emotional scars (and in the case of Randy, physical scars too), but it is also a film that shows their redeeming qualities with great joy.\n On a technical level, The Wrestler has a wonderful combination of rough and life-capturing cinematography.  Almost always handheld, the cinematography is highly reminiscent to documentary style filmmaking (this same style would be used for Black Swan as well).  The handheld camera gives the film an additional sense of realism and also places the audience in the ring with Randy \"The Ram\".  \n Mickey Rourke is in top physical shape and plays the role to perfection in his comeback film.  During his time away from acting in the 1990s, Mickey Rourke became a professional boxer and now suffers from short-term memory loss (similarly implied to be a symptom that his character Randy suffers from as well).  Rourke's experience as a fighter only enhances his visceral performance as a wrestler trying to return to the fame and glory he once had.\n Majority of the soundtrack is rock anthems from the 80s (Guns N' Roses and Ratt specifically), and the films score by Clint Mansell features Slash on guitar.  This touch adds to the atmosphere of the film and automatically places the audience in the mind of a man who lived through the 1980s and thoroughly enjoyed it.\n The Wrestler is a gritty film, but it is filled with life and powerful performances that make this film a pleasure to watch.  Blending artistry and classic-commercial-style filmmaking, this film is memorable and worth the time of viewers everywhere.",

The Wrestler is at times beautiful, at times disheartening, and at other times--as in the style of Aronofsky--thrilling and disillusioned in its portrayal of the destruction of the human spirit.

It is a very hard-hitting and real movie about the struggles in life, lost identity and redemption that quite frankly was robbed by the Oscars for not being considered for best picture, among many others. First things first, the performance by Rourke - and what a performance that is. Rourke portrays Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, a washed-up professional wrestler whose glory days are long gone. The performance, aided by a fantastic screenplay, sees Randy come to terms with retirement after suffering a long overdue heart attack due to his lengthy career and drug abuse, whilst harboring affection for a stripper named Pam, or 'Cassidy' (Marisa Tomei) as well as trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). Rourke gives the most powerful performance I have seen in quite some time, causing every part of your body to beg for him to find redemption despite his self-destructive nature. The direction from Aronofsky is very strong indeed and the film is shot incredibly well - particularly pleasing are the wrestling scenes, which you can tell have been the focus of much hard work by everyone involved. I don't think many professional wrestlers will be disappointed with this film. The dialogue isn't all too complicated or deep, but it really doesn't need to be when executed this perfectly. The message is strong and almost 100% void of cliches throughout - there's really not a lot of bad things to say about this film.Overall The Wrestler is a powerfully moving tale about salvation, driven by the performance of Rourke's career (not to take away from his co-stars) and overseen by the brilliant direction of Aronofsky. I would definitely recommend watching it, sports-fan or not you will find it hard not to connect to it.",

His lifestyle, however, begins to crash down when he suffers a mild heart attack which puts his wrestling career on potentially permanent hold.

The movie is your basic character study, but it's told with such an original character in such a subversive way.  Mickey Rourke is my current frontrunner for best performance of the year as Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson.  Like I said, the movie's genius comes through this character and all the subtleties that find their way into the picture.  I've never seen so many subtle nuances in a character.  First, he's an 80s style pro wrestler, he dyes his long head banger hair blonde, he wears a hearing aid that whines every time he turns it off, his elbows become his own traditional signature gesture, and so on and so forth.  The movie can be painful to watch at moments, and painfully funny at others.  One moment he's pulling razor wire out of his side, the next he's tossing tuna salad behind a deli counter.  One aspect that really stood out for me was the sfx editing.  The cuts to and from Clint Mansell's gorgeously subtle musical score, the hearing aid, and the internal rise of crowd cheering all just left me inspired by the editorial choices.  I was also very pleased to see Mr. Aronofsky use another different visual style, this time using the handicam look that gave the New Jersey setting a cold, dank, and very true-to-life feel.  A pretty picture, this ain't.  The vibe was dismal and it works, it works better than I could've imagined.  I'm curious to see what the reaction to this movie will be, because to me it felt like the most artistic crowd pleaser I've ever seen.  At the same time the familiar storyline might put off some viewers.  Look I think I'm just gonna write a really long ass review on my blog but when this movie does finally come out in December, give it a shot.  It is by far one of the best films this year.",

Filme bien dirigido por Darren Aronofsky que presenta el mundo de los peleadores de lucha libre sin tapujos ni evasivas, mostrando tal cual como es su mundo tras bambalinas, lo cual considero que fué una propuesta valiente, ya que aunque el expectador del filme tiene un asiento de primera fila para ver qué sucede antes y después de las luchas, cuando ellos salen, guardan el secreto de su mundo ante los extraños que se topan guardando la imagen que ellos han creado antes sus admiradores.

He works in a grocery store, ad has a manager who mocks him for his wrestling background. He left his family when his daughter was young, and she hates him now. He be-friends a stripper played by Marisa Tomei. He still does several fights, and he is still good.. Once he has a heart attack he decides to change his life entirely. He tries to fix his relationship with his daughter, and tries to get healthy again.\n\nMickey Rourke gives really good acting job in this movie which reminded me of Jeff Bridges performance in Crazy Heart. This film was a lot like Crazy Heart. It had the same feel, but different stories. They both had people who are at the end of their careers, and that have stage names, and health problems. However in the Wrestler there is no happy ending, and nothing gets resolved. That is the one weird part of this film, and the only reason why I don't think it is great. I wish that there were some more happy elements in it. They made it seem like he was fixing certain issues, but he didn't.\n\nThe wrestling is so fake. Well I mean not fake in a way that it looked bad, but it has all of the stuff you see in stuff like RAW wrestling that looks so staged. Like at the end when he is in the fight, his opponent is saying to him come on finish it we have given them enough of a show. The fight he is in before he gets a heart attack they are using staple guns, and barb wire. His opponent staples a dollar bill to his forehead. The fighting is so messed up. He also does steroids in one scene before a fight. He also cuts his forehead secretly while he is on the floor, to make it look like he got hit that hard. This is a very good movie but it points out the stupidity on wrestling matches like that.",

            "content": "The Wrestler is a stark glimpse into the life of an individual who refuses to let go of a happier time in his life. Mickey Rourke (in the performance of his career) portrays Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson-the aging professional wrestler who clings onto his dying career like a heroin addict clings to his needle. He knows continuing to wrestle with his bad heart and failing body will lead to his demise, but he has nothing else. In the ring, he is accepted and loved. He is able forget about his failed relationship with his daughter, his menial minimum wage job, and his inability to pay his trailer rent on time. Wrestling fans who still remember him consider him to be a legend.  What Randy fails to realize, however, is that it is his inability to let go of his past that is perpetuating many of the failures in the rest of his life. \n\nHis mental state is in a sort of deep freeze. He is stuck in the 1980s. He still plays his old NES and he doesn't have a cell phone or a computer. If a product was created after 1990, Randy wants no part of it. In this respect I see some interesting parallels between Randy and another legendary cinematic character-Norma Desmond (from the film, Sunset Blvd).\n\nWhat I really enjoyed about the film is the relationship between Randy and Cassidy (played perfectly by Marissa Tomei)-a stripper at the club Randy frequents. Both individuals work in the entertainment industry and have jobs that demand youth and physical fitness. Both are in the twilight of their respective careers. The key differences arise in their approaches to their individual situations.\n\nCassidy's outlook on her life and career play a brilliant contrast to Rourke's Randy \"The Ram\". Unlike Randy, Cassidy is eager to leave her job behind. She clearly separates her personal family life from her career, and feels uncomfortable letting the two mix in any way. Her work as an exotic dancer is a means by which she cares for her child, it does not define her. She knows she will not be able to strip much longer and has made plans to move on with her life. She is not clinging to her past like Randy. If anything, she is trying to forget it.\n\nDarren Aronofsky is one of my favorite modern directors, and his film \"The Wrestler\" should be lauded as one of the finest of his career.",
