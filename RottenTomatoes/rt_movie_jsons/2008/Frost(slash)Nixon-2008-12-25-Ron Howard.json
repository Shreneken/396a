    "summary": "In 1977, three years after the Watergate scandal that ended his presidency, Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) selects British TV personality David Frost (Michael Sheen) to conduct a one-on-one, exclusive interview. Though Nixon believes it will be easy to mislead Frost, and the latter's own team doubts that he can stand up to the former president, what actually unfolds is an unexpectedly candid and revealing interview before the court of public opinion.",

            "content": "This somewhat fictionalized story of the legendary interviews between British talk-show host and television outcast David Frost and disgraced former president Richard M. Nixon is a solid docudrama. Entertaining, witty, with fine period details, it metaphorically presents this showdown between two men as a boxing match. Peter Morgan's script (adapted from his successful London and Broadway play) shows us the preparation, the practice, the anticipation both these \"outsiders\" felt leading up to the big show. Frost would throw a punch. Nixon would counter and so on, as these adversaries engaged in a historic dance of wills and wit. Director Ron Howard opens up the scope of the story from the stage play, and that works for and against the film. We get to see more prep work and more details about the men behind both Frost and Nixon, but that shortchanges the interviews, the time span of which is shortened for dramatic purposes. Michael Sheen is amazing as Frost, suggesting a flippant heel who saw an opportunity to give Nixon \"the trial he never had\" and gambled everything on it. Frank Langella doesn't look much like \"Tricky Dick,\" but he is brilliant at bringing empathy for this fascinating figure, a sad, lonely, intelligent, but self-loathing man who couldn't overcome his desire to get back at a world he viewed as always looking down on him. The genius of both performances is that neither of them devolve into caricature. And if the film isn't a knockout, it does flirt with the greatness achieved by the prizefight at the center of it",

All the actor's did a great job portraying their roles, especially the guy who played Nixon.   It ends up being a good human interest story with characters you're interested in getting to know.  This movie is a must see for anyone who has an interest in that period of history or the history of the presidency.",

We were glued to the TV. \n\nAfterwards, I was just glad that Nixon resigned--I never watched the Frost/Nixon interviews. But I had read the unexpected ending of the interviews in the newspapers. While, the context in the movie probably made Nixon's statements seem more black and white (that's what I've read), I want to thank Ron Howard and all of the many people who helped to make this movie for finally making Nixon's statements real to me.

            "content": "I think the discussion of Frost/Nixon needs to start with a statement about the challenge of acting while impersonating. Because Richard Nixon is an extremely famous historical figure, he has been impersonated by people (particularly comedians) for decades. That means the challenge for Frank Langella is finding a way to embody this character without becoming another caricature or parody. That is probably the most impressive aspect of this entire film. I never once felt Langella was mocking, and he never fell out of the character either. Perhaps the best compliment I can pay him as an actor is that there came a point in Frost/Nixon where I just forgot it was an actor playing a role, and I thought of him as Nixon. Michael Sheen didn’t have quite as high of a mountain to climb since David Frost is not as much of a household name, but I also thought his performance was brilliant. This was definitely a film with a stacked cast that all did a wonderful job. Prior to watching this movie, I was unaware that any of this happened. It was fascinating to see the process that these men went through in order to acquire an interview with the former president, and also the amount of time and effort that went into research and preparations so that they could get to the truth. All of this created a superb build to the film, and left me anxiously anticipating the moment when recording would commence. I think this is where the movie most suffers from the limitations of being theatrical feature length, though. Because they need to trim down the footage of these interviews in order to make this a reasonable 2-hour film, I felt like they lost a little of the magic that was created in this TV interview. These two men were essentially having a verbal boxing match, and we only see the highlights. As a result, there were moments when I felt that they didn’t go deep enough into how amazing Frost was in getting Nixon to the point of confession. That’s not to say the movie fell flat or didn’t achieve its goal. In fact, the first thing that I wanted to do after the movie ended, was seek out the footage from the original interview. Since the movie had to compress things so much, all I wanted was more of the story to see how they got to the big finish. One of the stranger choices in Frost/Nixon was the fact that they formatted the film as if it was a documentary. They inserted one-on-one interviews with many of the characters in what felt like “present day” reflecting on what happened. In my opinion, they should have just used the actual historical people for those interviews, or left them out altogether. It never seemed like a necessary part of the film, and it was just an odd choice. However, the overall movie was a satisfying experience, and in a surprise twist it didn’t make Nixon look like the devil incarnate. It treated our former president with a modicum of respect, even though it was all about discovering the ugly truth behind the mistakes he made in the White House. That’s why I found Frost/Nixon to be an impressive and satisfying film.",

            "content": "A dramatic tactical battle with the fate of America's political viability in the balance, Frost/Nixon benefits from the strength of its leads and an effective script. However, there is a balance to be struck between historical fact and cinematic license when determining what constitutes a lasting piece of film based on reality. In this context, the writers took considerable license in their depiction of the events, particularly their actual importance to political discourse and Nixon's own legacy, given that the actual interview was hardly a herald of a massive shift in public opinion and is likely best remembered for the \"if the President does it, then it's not illegal\" sound clip more than any cultural influence. Still, with the extent of executive power remaining a hotly contested political topic, there is still a degree of timeliness associated with Frost/Nixon to complement the strength of the performances. Great selection in establishing the supporting cast as well, but Langella is the standout in a depiction of Nixon that is far more nuanced than most. (4/5)",

            "content": "While Richard Nixon made terrible decisions while serving as President of the United States and abused his power in a way that has tainted the position forever. Yet he remains one of the most interesting and relatable presidents as he seems so unsuited to this position with all of his very visible insecurities, discomfort with public life and struggle to make people like him. More people have felt the way that Nixon felt as he tried to charm a nation of voters than have been physically attractive womanizers who were beloved by the media and general public as in the case of John F. Kennedy. This is why I was excited to see this film as this mysterious but compelling man is it's subject and in part my expectations of the film were what left me terribly disappointed.\n\nIn 1977 journalist David Frost, Michael Sheen, is successful as a presenter of trash television in Australia but feels that his career is on the decline and is still hurt due to his failure in America. He sees a chance to revitalize his career by offering hundreds of thousands of dollars to interview disgraced former United States President Richard Nixon, Frank Langella, but fails to rustle up interest from networks who would broadcast the interviews. Nixon trusts that Frost will be a soft interviewer and will provide him an opportunity to rehabilitate his image without having to answer difficult questions about the Watergate Scandal or admit guilt for his past actions. Both assemble teams who prepare them to attack one another and be on the lookout for evasions or unexpected questions. Frost is initially unsuccessful as Nixon is able to misdirect him and lead the interview in a direction that will present him in a positive light and prevent Frost from getting the answers he wants.\n\nFew endings have irritated me more than the end of this film in which the man that the film has built up as a fascinating enigma who still holds the attention of the public today is completely dismissed. One of Frost's researchers, the fastidious James Reston, Jr., Sam Rockwell, dismisses Nixon's legacy and states that he is primarily known for the fact that whenever a scandal occurs the word \"Gate\" is added onto the end of it. From what we know in reality this is simply untrue as in the mid-1980s Nixon made Gallup's poll of the ten most admired people in the world and was used by Bill Clinton as an adviser in the 1990s. He is thought about and talked about more than almost any other president of the 20th century and when people imagine him, the stern elder statesman, it is with a certain fond remembrance for a time when even the craziest of men felt some compulsion to appear composed and professional in public.\n\nWhat this film settles on is the idea that at heart Frost and Nixon are very similar, both outsiders in some ways, and they ultimately form a bond that rises above their conflict during the interview. This allows for some big, showy scenes in which Frost ‘reveals' the hurt behind his positive demeanor and a drunk Nixon makes an emotional late night confession to a bewildered Frost over the phone. Both Sheen and Langella played these roles on the stage and there is the feeling that each are over rehearsed in their roles with none of the spontaneity and passion that should accompany playing figures with this level of mystique. There is also one of those poorly written scenes in which two characters who would already be aware of an event that occurred and not have to verbally acknowledge it have a long ‘discussion' in which they talk about the Kennedy debates. Peter Morgan can be a very fine screenwriter and he did some of his best work the following year on The Damned United (2009) but this was a clunky screenplay that made it's stage origins clear and did not delve into Nixon's rich, tortured psyche enough. \n\nAt the film's close we do not know about either of the men in a meaningful way and while some audience members may walk away with a history lesson of sorts they do not get the character study that Nixon deserves.",

Frost is a television persona who wants to make the big splash as a interviewer and pays big money to have an exclusive with x-president Nixon. Thinking Frost is an easy interview Nixon takes him on. Frost has everything to loose and Nixon has everything to gain. While American media does not take Frost seriously the British television host must now prove that he can be a foil to a x-president looking to avoid guilt. Thanks to the performances the film is engaging, and fast paced. Frank Langella is great as Nixon and for some moments you almost feel sorry for him even though you don't want to. Michael Sheen is perfectly cast as Frost. You question at many points in the film if Sheen is a worthy opposite to Langella and in the end he comes out triumphantly. Watch this film.

As much as brilliant Howard's cast is, not all of them delivers or even justifies the script with their performance. \n\nThe urge of his, to cast that resonates a lot to the actual personas is both pro and con since it barrs the feature on performance level and on the other hand, the environment created in here feels real and that's saying a lot. As mentioned, the crisp is alive and pulsating on screen that cuts deeper than ever among the characters and the palpable tone offered to them. \n\nHoward's structure as always follows a textbook equation, but it is done with such panache in here that it may remind you of \"A Beautiful Mind\". The writing is smarter, adaptive and gripping with layered dialogues and fine polishing of the script that keeps it short and to the point. \n\nIt may be short on technical aspects like background score and art designing but has a fine cinematography. It is shot nicely with decent camera work that brings out the best from each frame. Langella has never been better in his portrayal and so is Sheen with an impressive work and support by Bacon, Rockwell, Platt and Hall. \n\nMorgan's screenplay is layered and is justified aptly by Howard's execution skills that communicates unflinchingly with the viewers. The detailed research done by the makers, the three part interview and Langella's performance at the heart of it are the high points of the feature. \n\nFrost/Nixon is an essentially well crafted act as much as it is politically, and since it speaks volume through character's perspective, it is more than \"news\" to ears.",

The framing of these conversations are immaculate. Howard easily takes the audience through many notable historical events and intricate sequences rendered accessible thanks to his streamlined direction. The pacing is so fast and engaging that the plot is always understandable and the viewing experience is always pleasant.\n\nFrost/Nixon takes the time and effort to do its research in set design, costume design, accurate accents, accurate information, meticulous movements of characters  to make them more true to their real life personas. Peter Morgan's screenplay is as nuanced and detailed as any film's script can be written.\n\nMichael Sheen is so deep and complex as the television host David Frost. He balances Frost's playboy nature with the seriousness of his situation. Frank Langella is peerless as President Richard Nixon. He captures Nixon's self assured nature and self serving attitude. Langella as nails Nixon's accent and facial tendencies as well as his penchant for historical knowledge flaunting. Frost/Nixon's cast is incredible front to back.\n\nFurthermore, Frost/Nixon's supporting cast is so passionate and impressive. I am particularly impressed by Kevin Bacon, Toby Jones, and Sam Rockwell's acting. They portrayal real men with a level of respect and honesty rare in historical dramas about more controversial figures.\n\nLastly, Hans Zimmer composed a wonderful score to Frost/Nixon. He understates the tone for each scene with inquisitive musical cues to build a sense of suspense. Frost/Nixon's atmosphere largely stems from his beautiful score.\n\nIn all, Frost/Nixon persists as an accurate depiction of Nixon's final moments in the spotlight of American history. We witness a complete recreation of the most turbulent times in the history of the American Presidency. Frost/Nixon is just an awesome film!",

The characters are shallowly conceived - I'm sure the real David Frost is much more than the irritatingly false toothy grin he's given in the movie, and the real Richard Nixon, whether you liked his politics or not, was more than the elephant seal portrayed by Frank Langella. The essential conflict in the film was quite simple and predictable. The members of David Frost's research team are defined solely by their professional or ideological goals, and have no depth beyond that. The whole thing feels like a made-for-TV movie. I never saw the play, but it *must* have been more interesting and sophisticated than this simplistic piece of period-piece fluff. The film makes me curious about whether this plastic bead made by Ron Howard came from a pearl.",

This was Nixon's first public appearance since his resignation and finally someone was able to get him to admit his mistakes re Watergate.  Considering that Nixon had denied and fought the allegations with every ounce of energy he had for 2 years (leading to his resignation) this was a historic acknowledgement of his lying.

As the films go along we see these men shapeshift, occasionally taking on each other attitudes, and experiencing a wealth of emotions that stem from conflicts not only with each other, but within themselves. Sheen and Langella, who played their respective roles in the stage play, are clearly very comfortable in the parts, and their verbal toing and froing is where the film really shines. Langella draws out an inner confidence, borderline arrogance, from Nixon's dejected persona, and surprises us with his ease at defending himself while at his lowest time. The movie takes a fair amount of artistic license, but what liberties are taken aren't there to pervert the facts of history, merely to enhance the drama. The supporting cast, including Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell and Oliver Platt, always reliable actors, serve the movie beautifully, and while they have plenty of great moments, the 2 leads truly steal the show, going head to head in a war of words, ethics and egos. I didn't know much at all about the Frost/Nixon interviews, but now that I've seen this film I might just go away and watch them, and that's the sign of a truly great historic movie.

Another reason why this film works so well is the acting. All across the board, magnificent. One of the best ensemble-casts ever! Lastly, with all the jargon and lingo of political talk, the themes of this film are still very relatable. On one hand, this film conveys the message of being careful about what you wish for because if you get it, what cost will it be to you and to those around you? On the other, the film conveys the message of redemption and if you admit to your mistakes, you will ultimately be forgiven and your conscience will be clear. Overall, this is an excellent film.

He was the 37th U.S. President, and many people feel that, because of his actions toward the war in Vietnam, and the scandal from the Watergate hotel, have defined him as a bad president. All of this led us to his infamous resignation from office- a feat no other U.S. president has done since. After that, there came several interviews featuring President Nixon- one of these such interviews was with British news reporter David Frost. These interviews not only shaped future political interviews, but also a landmark in television history as many people saw them, and got A better understanding of who Nixon was. One of these people was Peter Morgan, a playwright who not only adapted the interviews as a popular stage production, but also the 2008 film version known as \"Frost/Nixon\". When the movie came out, it was praised for its acting ability, and tough and relatable drama that was the center of attention. \"Frost/Nixon\" is a powerful drama that will both entertain and educate viewers on a pivotal and crucial moment in United States history.\n\nThe story involves the above mentioned figures- Richard M. Nixon (Frank Langella) and David Frost (Michael Sheen)- as they plan out a series of interviews detailing the former's life as President. The only downside to all of this is that David doesn't think he has the guts to tackle such a controversial figure like Nixon, and it might ruin his reputation; even his bank. David also has one big question on his mind that he feels will be unanswered: can the truth be told in front of millions of people watching on a small screen? He is going to find out.\n\n\"Frost/Nixon\" is a remarkable film to watch with an older crowd. By this, younger audiences will learn what happened during a problematic times in the United States, and older audiences will get what actually happened during that time frame. The direction by Ron Howard is great as the action is centered on how the interviews were conducted, and all the troubles Frost had to go through in order to secure funding for this to happen. The editing makes the movie flow at a nice pace of two hours, keeping audiences entertained for that specific time. Musically, Hans Zimmer does a great job by creating a score that fits the tone of the movie perfectly. Even the costumes fit the time period very well, and the entire production looks fantastic. However, what really stands out is the acting, and even though it is just people recreating infamous roles, everyone does a phenomenal job.\n\nThe only criticism that is worth that is worth mentioning is that, yes, some of the interviews do not stick that close to the original source material, and the third act is the most engaging. But these are only nitpicks.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Frost/Nixon\" is a great movie that brilliantly recreates and showcases a pivotal moment in history through some outstanding acting that audiences will remember, on performances based on real people like David Frost and Richard M. Nixon.",

And that is coming from someone like myself who is fascinated with Richard Nixon and this period in American history.  First and foremost I know that Frank Langela plays the role of Nixon in the play on stage.  I understand that, and he's wildly popular among critics and theatregoers for his portrayal of this complicated man.  I really must be missing something here, because I just don't see it at all.  There is nothing Nixon about him in the slightest.  He doesn't look anything like him, he doesn't sound anything like him and honestly his portrayal of Nixon is really not authentic what so ever.  Langela plays Nixon as a flawed but very arrogant and sure of himself guy, which is not the case.  Nixon was not only flawed, but socially awkward, depressed, introverted, self conscious and flat out strange.  The portrayal is just all wrong in my opinion.  Michael Sheen does a fantastic job playing David Frost however and I highly enjoyed his performance.  The movie itself for a hardcore Nixon or political fan of this period, is probably something right up your alley.  But does this topic have enough substance for a major motion picture that spans 2 hours ? Not a chance.  I found myself getting bored with this movie rather quickly.  If you want to watch a movie about Nixon do yourself a favor and just watch Nixon by Oliver Stone, or go even a step further and watch the real actual interviews that this movie is based upon.",

Famous actors act like it's an interview about the interview, talking about the past recalling what has happened before and after the very, very famous 1977 interviews of Richard Nixon by british tv host David Frost. The rest is history, and the interviews are available for free on youtube.\n\nPros: Sam Rockwell, the acting is absolutely fantastic and there is some serious attention to the details, from costumes to haircuts to the voice acting by Langella, to resemble Nixon's babbling deep voice. There is also Hall's serious eye-candy, so it's by far a great view from the start to the end. Surprising addition to the team is the presence of Michael Sheen, who for me will forever be Lucien from Underworld (which isn't exactly a compliment), yet holds his ground with the difficult character and a great british accent.\n\nCons: Richard Nixon looks nothing like Nixon, I understand the choice of actor because of the quality of Langella's acting, but while Frost is VERY similar to the original, it takes a lot of imagination to remember that Langella's supposed to be nixon. \nSheen's character furthermore is dislikable from the very beginning, as he -but maybe that's the director's choice- seems to be on edge/uncomfortable the entire time throughout the movie.\nKevin Bacon still is absolutely terrible at what he does and seems completely overrated as his character is pointless from minute 0 to the very end, two hours later.\n\nOverall a great movie to watch, but not a party choice. Must Watch. Alone.",

            "content": "Ron Howard's compelling film about one of the most famous American television interviews utilises its artistic license to an extent that 'Frost/Nixon' is best taken as a piece of creative non-fiction rather than an outright historical drama. This does not distract from the competencies of the production, whose design, score, photography and editing give the film a sense of authenticity. In the titular roles, Michael Sheen is boyishly charismatic and the perfect opponent to the assured and intimidating Frank Langella; Oliver Platt and especially Kevin Bacon are in solid form as their respective sidekicks. That these particular actors aren't spitting images of their real-life counterparts is irrelevant - their performances are strong and affecting because they embody vital characteristics that give them the depth required for the telling of such a story. Even though the film might keep those unfamiliar with the events leading up to the interview at a distance, a viewing of Alan J. Pakula's superior 'All the President's Men' (1976) will help put this into context, it's a worthwhile exercise nonetheless.",

From this movie I gathered Nixon was incredibly smart, unfortunately he had some moral failings that dug him into a hole. I found the film engaging and as entertaining as the topic could be. I think Frost came in very unprepared and very unassuming. Quickly he started getting clobbered and realized Nixon was a harder opponent than what he was used to. However, he started listening to ppl about his shortcomings and by chance he received a very candid drunken call by Nixon on the 11th hr. This spurred him into action and got him doing his research and he came out on top in the end. Like Frost said tho, there could only be 1 winner in the end. I like All the Presidents Men a lil bit better for history of Watergate tho, this was more a character study. I enjoyed Langellas performance.",

            "content": "After seeing both Nixon and Dick, I still knew little about Richard Nixon since the stories had a convoluted focus on him in the case of Nixon, or were comedically satirical in the case of Dick. But under extremely positive acclaim from my own father I simply had to see Frost/Nixon to really embrace not just his credibility, but the entire concept of politics within the context of a historically defining intense debate.\n\nThere isn't too much to say about a film like Frost /Nixon which can't be simplified to emphasising two key elements of the film: The efforts of Ron Howard and the efforts of the two lead actors.\nYes, Frost/Nixon is well shot and edited very timely, but the most important elements of the film aren't technical, they are practical. Frost/Nixon is a simple film on a small scale which clearly stays true to the stage play that inspired it by maintaining a very formal theatrical style as a film.\nPeter Morgan's screenplay is an incredibly intelligent one, and thanks to Ron Howard it is never misused. Ron Howard's direction is clearly at some of his best in Frost/Nixon, because with the simplicity of the story is maintained by him and yet he never skimps on emphasising the most important dramatic aspects of the film. While touching upon the importance of who the titular characters are well enough, he manages to shift the focus of the film into what is happening now while also reminding us of why it is happening. Ron Howard ensures that the important focus of the characters is intelligent and educational to audiences. I know that I learned a lot about both characters from Frost/Nixon even though its focus is all on a small time period of their lives. And frankly, Ron Howard's incredible effort as the director who had to tie everything in the film together deserves nothing short of an Academy Award nomination for Best Director which he deservingly received. His direction makes the story stay more true to the real story than his previous film A Beautiful Mind did, so his sense of telling the true story has immensely increased over time.\nThe second aspect and clearly the most important of the film is the acting, predominantly the acting of the cast members portraying the titular figures David Frost and Richard Nixon.\nLike I said before, I've seen Nixon and I've seen Dick. But I've never seen anybody portray Richard Nixon as finely as Frank Langella did in Frost/Nixon. In Frost/Nixon, Frank Langella captures every inch of Richard Nixon's natural physicality, manner of speaking and way of thinking. Richard Nixon has never felt more genuinely real on screen than he has in Frost/Nixon, because Frank Langella's true passion for the role and dedication to every minor detail brings Richard Nixon to life. Frank Langella truly makes a compelling and powerhouse effort which is slightly antagonistic as well as sympathetic. See, while the film characterises Richard Nixon as a villain, Frank Langella makes the intelligent decision to play himself off as a victim of sorts, much like the real Richard Nixon did. He captures the intelligent qualities of Richard Nixon, his strengths and his weaknesses, and so when he and David Frost clash heads in interviews he makes a compelling case to defend himself without ever showing an antagonistic nature towards Michael Sheen. His performance is undoubtedly the greatest of his career and the most effective of any man to have ever portrayed Richard Nixon so flawlessly, and so it is no surprise that an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor is waiting for him at the end of the road.\nMichael Sheen gives a performance which most critics find to stand in the shadow of Frank Langella's excellent performance as Richard Nixon. But I had seen him portrayed enough times before to know that Frank Langella was spot on, in films such as Nixon and Dick or even in cartoons satirising the man for his work, such as The Simpsons or Futurama. Who I had never seen before was David Frost, and if not for Frost/Nixon I most likely would not have. But thanks to a marvellous performance by Michael Sheen which was snubbed by the Academy Awards, I have a great admiration for the man. David Frost was a talk-show host who changed history by cracking the Richard Nixon safe on a sophisticated and visually entertaining level which never crossed the line into interrogation but nearly borderlines as a cross-examination, and yet he still had the immense charm of an appealing talk show host who genuinely seems like a good person. And Ron Howard casts Michael Sheen in the role, an actor with the relentless confidence of Edward D. Wood Jr., the charm and line delivery of David Bowie, and above all a smile which is so captivating and friendly without being the slightest bit pompous or obnoxious that it makes him impossible to dislike. Michael Sheen's smile is one that I simply cannot compare to any other actor, as much as I try. His performance missed out on a deserved Academy Award nomination due to being overshadowed by Frank Langella, but there is no denying the talents of Michael Sheen in Frost/Nixon. \nIt's really interesting to see both Frank Langella and Michael Sheen go at each other because the chemistry they share is absolutely incredible in Frost/Nixon. Its so intense to watch them battle wits and just wait to see who will come out on top, and when they engage with each other is when the film is at its most undeniably effective and interesting. They create a lot of intensity by engaging with each other in the roles of David Frost and Richard Nixon, and it is so powerfully interesting that it leaves audiences wanting to witness the real interviews that happened between them to examine the realism in Frost/Nixon.\nMatthew Macfadyen gives a confident supporting performance as well in which he shares a strong business-related chemistry with Michael Sheen which becomes the source of a lot of the story development.\nKevin Bacon and Toby Jones manage to make a memorable impact for working the intense mood of the story into the small elements of their performances so that the effect of what is going on is seen more clearly from a wider perspective. Rebecca Hall gives a strong supporting performance as well.\n\nSo Frost/Nixon is simple: It doesn't have a huge story but all the importance within it rests squarely on the truth behind it and the impact it had on the world, and it is directed excellently by Ron Howard and features the greatest performances that Michael Sheen and Frank Langella have ever given.",

            "content": "I'm going to be the bad guy here and say that this was a pretty big disappointment. The problem really lies in what this is about- the interviews between Frost and Nixon, that's really the source material, never mind the stage play for a minute. Now, the reality is that what is depicted in this film is pretty different from what actually happened. For me, it takes its artistic licence a bit too far to the extent that what we get here, is actually less-effective than what actually happened.\r\n\r\nFirstly though, I have to say that the performances here didn't really do much for me. Sheen didn't really seem like Frost at all with his performance suggesting a man relatively unable to go face to face with Nixon but in reality he was very much present and aware and that's not really shown enough here, it feels held back for dramatic purposes and leaves Frost's character feeling somewhat stale in comparison to Nixon.\r\n\r\nLangella certainly makes for a convincing Nixon but his performance feels suited to another film altogether- save the 'spirit of the man' kind of performance for a biopic, because this is supposed to be a retelling of a fairly short period of time during which Nixon behaved in a specific way and here it feels like that is ignored and replaced instead with a dramatization of Nixon that, while strong, feels more like a vague imitation of the real Nixon mixed with a different person entirely. The acting may be strong but all of the precise characteristics of Nixon feel missing. It feels like a cut-out more than a true depiction.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, there's not much else going on performance-wise that's really trying to be impactful. Bacon's character feels cliché and Rockwell isn't having to do much out of the normal with his part. It all feels a bit too mechanical and hyped-up which suggests to me that the film didn't feel confident enough to deliver on its premise in a realistic way and instead had to resort to some of the typical Hollywoodized approaches such as you might find in an, um... Ron Howard movie.\r\n\r\nThe next issue is historical stuff- sure this isn't a documentary and it has to be entertaining but everywhere you look, things seem manipulated as if trying to squeeze life out of a dead-on-arrival idea. The film dismisses Frost's first interviews as failures in order to build up to the final one but in reality they were all well-conducted, Nixon's defences of his actions are often cut out here and the dialogue is cropped to make it seem as if he was more revealing than he really was, there's a completely fabricated phone call that is clearly there to try and create tension that didn't really exist, it's implied that Frost felt unhappy with his performances at first which is again untrue- it's clutching at straws really and worst yet, some of the truly fascinating events that did occur in the final interview, are watered-down here take for example Nixon's attempts to lower the pressure by trying to be funny at crucial points in the interview.\r\n\r\nTake it further still- were the events themselves really deserving of a film?  A dramatic re-enactment of some television interviews? The big stuff happens before this film starts- Watergate is over with as is Nixon's presidency. Sure, the interviews got strong ratings and for good reason too but are we going to see a series of films based on interviews with political figures because that'd get older than the Fast & Furious franchise in a heartbeat?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've covered the stuff I take issue with but that was certainly a little one-sided. Overall, it's an entirely fine experience- if you have only a passing interest in the events then you might enjoy this portrayal and if we imagine the performances were of fictional characters then they'd all be good. It is also a drama so it's not entirely fair to pick out all of its inaccuracies when it's only trying to make the experience better. The script is good at getting a lot of the bigger stuff in there and certainly at building it all up and it's both eloquent and witty and as a stand-alone element, possibly the strongest feature of the film. \r\n\r\nThe story is interesting enough to be entertaining and the glossy visuals seem to fit well with Frost and make Nixon seem out of his comfort zone just by being in the film which is an interesting thing to see. It's also well-shot and flies by considering it hits the two-hour mark. It has the marks of experience that you'd expect from Howard and so even with all the issues, there's never an unpleasant experience.\r\n\r\nThe strong execution of the technical elements is enough to give this one a fresh rating but I'm still left feeling like it's a mountain out of a molehill- things are put here that never happened and everything feels desperate to meet your expectations but if you've seen the interviews then you already know what happens and will take nothing from this at all. If you just want a strong drama and dismiss entirely that this is based on real events, then it still doesn't seem to cut it because the story just isn't big enough- there's one section of real, harrowing, stuff and it's not enough to justify two-hours of film. This story makes a lot of sense as a play but on film, well it'd already been done- the real interviews. \r\n\r\nBetter recording and some actors to re-enact the thing in brief isn't bringing anything new to the table. I can see how the tension could fill a theatre, how a condensed re-telling of a minor moment in history could make for a good evening out but the cameras here capture little that's truly impactful and when such occurrences arrive they are too contrived. This is neither a bad nor good film- it's a bad film idea trying to be a good film.  What's left is entirely OK but nothing more.",

Political dramas are almost never that entertaining, either having a bit too much truth (which can ruin the film entirely) or performances that are good, but mostly are there to attempt to win an Oscar.  Thankfully, \"Frost/Nixon\" is in the same category as \"Argo\"-- it's whip smart, absorbing, yet it can still appeal to audiences of all sorts.  Ron Howard has outdone himself here-- this is in no doubt, his best film.\n\tTaking place just as the Watergate Scandal erupted and Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) resigned from office, \"Frost/Nixon\" sees the world around the controversial man rather than the world itself.  When we're not peeking into the life of the President, we're instead watching David Frost (Michael Sheen), a talk-show host attempting to give a serious interview while trying to save his career.  The two personalities, so different, perfectly blend together, and each span of time focusing on one or the other are well spent.  What Howard does though, that's so mesmerizing, is that he delivers movie-worthy drama while still maintaining to leave the audience at the edge of their seat, and when the fateful final interview is taking place, we feel just as anxious as the world did on the same day in real-life.\n\tThe film never mimics the truth, it rather uses it as a guide.  The story itself is highly interesting, and Howard manages to grab the audience's attention as Sheen and Langella manage to give flawless performances that capture everything we know about Frost and Nixon.  Their never imitate like a character in a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch, but they interpret the two figures with utter perfection.\n            But \"Frost/Nixon\" begs the question-- was Nixon really a horrible guy like we all believed, or was his loneliness the source of his biggest mistakes? The film may play out like a tug-of-war, but by the end you can't help but sympathize with him.  \"Frost/Nixon\" ultimately reflects well (not shockingly) on Frost, who looks like an unsung hero.  The screenplay, which does a terrific job of separating fact from drama, is very well-written, to the point in which everything feels like real-life.  \n           \"Frost/Nixon\" is truly a great film.  It's never slow, boring, or dumb ... it's fast-paced, entertaining, and suspenseful.  Highly recommended.",

The way the film is shot is excellent, in a pseudo-documentary style with the main story progressing with the occasional short intermittent interview with various cast members in their roles. The whole film is shot with a grainy filter that puts you in the times, and being as simple as possible while still maintaining a certain elegance. The cast is great for each of their roles, led by Frank Langella as Nixon and Michael Sheen as Frost, and while the film is largely the interactions with these two, the supporting cast fills their roles well. The writing is great, the direction is superb, and the acting of both Langella and Sheen is what truly makes the movie, as at times the film makes you hate Nixon, other times respect him, and eventually pity him. The film is strangely moving, and completely captivating. Not for those who need excitement, sex or explosions to enjoy a film, but absolutely excellent and I highly recommend it.\n\n4.5 stars: Excellent",

And that's exactly what I got with 'Frost/Nixon'.\n\nWhen disgraced President Richard Nixon agreed to an interview with jet-setting television personality David Frost, he thought he'd found the key to saving his tarnished legacy. But, with a name to make and a reputation to overcome, Frost became one of Nixon's most formidable adversaries and engaged the leader in a charged battle of wits that changed the face of politics forever.\n\nI don't usually get too excited about politics but I knew about this interview and decided to watch the film. I wouldn't recommend it to someone wanting a light film, but if you commit to the 2 hours, you won't be disappointed.\nFrank Langella did an incredible job playing Nixon; physically the similarities were there but he took on the persona more so in his voice and gestures.\n\nFrost: Are you saying the President can do something illegal?\nNixon: I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal\n\nTalk about corruption and abuse of power. Geez.",

It is little wonder this film was nominated for 5 Oscars. I thought Langella was unlucky not to take out best actor for his part.\n\nThe tension that was built up throughout the movie was very well done, leading to the final interview between Frost and Nixon.\n\nI would highly recommend this film.",

            "content": "Brilliantly written and directed, Frost/Nixon succeeds largely thanks to on-screen insights into the lives of two very different personas conveyed by two very gifted actors, Frank Langella's disgraced Richard Nixon seeking a redemption and Michael Sheen's determined David Frost seeking a lifeline. The chemistry and on-screen verbal battles between Langella and Frost mark for a compelling and realistic reconstruction of the interviews that took place between Frost and Nixon in the 1970s. While the film is given the Hollywood treatment in parts almost as if sections could lead to debate as to whether it really took place, Ron Howard's tendency to give an Errol Morris-documentary feel to it plays as highly plausible to the belief that we are actually watching something real take place, with convincing supporting performances from Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell, Oliver Platt and Matthew MacFadyen only serving as a testament to this films attempt to tell a story as realistic and intelligent as possible. A very good film on a first viewing but a brilliant film on a second viewing, Frost/Nixon packs a punch that corresponds to its stance as a hugely interesting and enjoyable political drama.",
