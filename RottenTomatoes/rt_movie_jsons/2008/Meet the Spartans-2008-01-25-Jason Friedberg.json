You know how the story goes: the acting is awful, the production values are abysmal and Friedberg & Seltzer mistake pop culture references to whatever was trending at the time for actual humour. They're not even researched well since they only look at trailers and production notes. I cringed when they called the Cosmic Cube the \"Transformers Cube\". Seriously, the reviews for these awful parody films, with the possible exception of Date Movie, are interchangeable. I'd express relief that this 300 \"parody\" is short but they pad out the runtime with an end-credits sequence with a decent amount of deleted scenes. Yeah, Meet the Spartans is that bad, people.
