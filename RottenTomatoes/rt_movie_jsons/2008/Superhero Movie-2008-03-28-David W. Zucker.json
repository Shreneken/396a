Donning an uncomfortably tight costume, Rick becomes a mysterious crime fighter known as \"The Dragonfly.\" But standing in the way of truth, justice and the American Way is an evil villain known as \"The Hourglass,\" who plans to become immortal by sucking the life force out of anyone who gets in his way.",

            "content": "15 years later this is still a silly good time Writer-director Craig Mazin teams with David Zucker to make a superhero movie....but one that's actually poking fun at them A collection of colorful actors like Drake Bell, Sara Paxton, Christopher McDonald, Brent Spiner, Kevin Hart, the late Leslie Nielsen, Regina Hall, Pamela Anderson, Tracy Morgan, and Jeffrey Tambor Thank god this is one of the better parodies NOT involving Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer! Here the filmmakers are basically making fun of the first 'Spider-Man' having the main character named Rick Riker bitten by a dragonfly instead of a spider He develops super powers like strength, invulnerability, crawling to walls but he can't fly As expected he's in love with his next door neighbor Jill but doesn't have the courage to do anything Meanwhile the head CEO of Amalgamated Pharmaceuticals creates a way to stop death but he has to absorb other people's life energy to stay alive Hoping to make it permanent he plans to steal a rare mineral to absorb Empire City and Dragonfly is the only one who can stop him So many of these jokes and gags jab at 'X-Men', 'Fantastic Four' and 'Spider-Man' but also trying to maintain the heart of the story That's still notoriously difficult to do these days and humor isn't easy to balance Still this is one of the rare spoofs that manages to get some decent laughs It's not gonna work for everyone and one of the worst things in the movie involves the obligatory flatulence stuff, one scene in particular goes on for 5 minutes The pop culture references are expected too like Facebook and YouTube I definitely got the best bits from Nielsen and Hall Plus Drake Bell is a hoot to watch as a clumsy nerd becoming a hero next to Sara Paxton who's cute but still has a tremendous heart There's lots of instances where you can clearly see this was on a budget and some of the jokes haven't aged well but again this isn't high art we are looking for A decent enough comedy that'll kill an hour and a half making us appreciate real superhero movies",

And yeah, I might be biased becuase this is one of the first spoofs I've ever seen, and back in the day I found it hilarious, but now it's really not for me. So if you unplug your brain, or get drunk, or get high, this might be the perfect movie to put on with some friends and laugh at the stupidity and brainlessness of this.

It's like watching a collection of manatee jokes from Family Guy for two hours; the only difference is that this is live action, barely. Granted Superhero Movie is not a cinematic atrocity like Epic Movie, but that doesn't mean it's any good.\n\nThis movie mainly parodies Spider-Man, with scenes with X-Men, Batman Begins, and so on. Unlike Epic Movie, this actually stays true to the title throughout. Only superhero movies are spoofed here. The number of movies being satirized is smaller than Epic Movie, but that just makes it more focused and more structured. For the majority of the gags, they actually feel like gags. Not good gags, but gags. In the aforementioned Epic Movie, the \"jokes\" feel more like references than jokes. \n\nDrake Bell of Drake & Josh fame stars in Epic Movie, and he is one of the two actors in this movie who actually aren't that bad. He plays a riff on the Tobey Maguire Peter Parker, and his comedic timing is often the only thing that works about the gags. He is throughout most of the movie the only straight faced actor on camera. Almost everybody else is winking at the camera and just being obnoxious. The one other decent performance is Leslie Nielsen, in one of his last ever movie roles. He plays the Uncle Ben/Alfred Pennyworth character. He tries the best he can to make the jokes enjoyable, and he occasionally succeeds,  but the script sucks so hard that not even Leslie \"Don't Call Me Shirley\" Nielsen can't be enjoyable.\n\nSo in the end, Superhero Movie isn't as awful as the Seltzerburg films, mainly due to decent performances from Bell and Nielsen, but even they don't make this worth watching.

When he gets bitten by a genetically-engineered dragonfly, he turned into the superhero known as Dragonfly, possessing superpowers of a dragonfly except for flying. This is obviously a huge parody of Spider-Man. He witnesses a flashback in one scene where his parents are killed like in Batman Begins, giving the reason why he lives with his aunt and uncle played y Marion Ross and the late Leslie Nielsen. In order to control his powers, Xavier played by Tracy Morgan introduces him to his gifted school of superheroes like in X-Men where he meets Wolverine, Storm and Invisible Girl (parody of Invisible Woman from Fantastic Four) played by Pamela Anderson. When Dragonfly's nemesis, Lou Landers played by Christopher McDonald becomes the life-sucking Hourglass, it is up to Dragonfly to save Jill before Hourglass takes over the world. The film's main parody is Spider-Man. Other parodies that can be caught are Batman Begins, X-Men and Fantastic Four. I thought this was a good movie, it had a good story, made me laugh and did not center around too many movies to be called a parody. This is a good parody movie. Forget the Jason Friedberg and Aaron Steltzer shit and watch this because Superhero Movie gets a 9.5/10.",
