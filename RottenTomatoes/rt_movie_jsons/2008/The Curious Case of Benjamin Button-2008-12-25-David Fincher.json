Twelve years after his birth, he meets Daisy, a child who flickers in and out of his life as she grows up to be a dancer (Cate Blanchett). Though he has all sorts of unusual adventures over the course of his life, it is his relationship with Daisy, and the hope that they will come together at the right time, that drives Benjamin forward.",

So even if it feels over-familiar and a bit schmaltzy at times, director David Fincher's cast and crew, all aiding his stylized vision, bring the F. Scott Fitzgerald short story to vivid life. It's a testament to Brad Pitt's evolution as a leading man that he is able to carry a 166-minute film on his shoulders, especially when he spends quite a lot of time in make-up and digital aging effects. He is a strong, sturdy presence at the center of this. There are also three sensational female performances surrounding Pitt. Cate Blanchett is a modern-day Meryl Streep, a consistent actress who turns in a great performance every time. She is vivacious, sensual, and simply brilliant as the love of Benjamin's life. Tilda Swinton brings maturity and vulnerability to a lover of Benjamin's. But it is Taraji P. Henson, as Benjamin's mother, who is the heart, soul, and magic of the movie. She deserves the Oscar for best supporting actress for her work here. Fincher, always a visionary, frames many a gorgeous shot with amazing visual effects and dreamy, under-lit photography. It doesn't often surprise, but this sentimental journey of life, love, and loss earns its emotions and remains consistently enjoyable, pretty much from start to finish",

After seeing it myself, while it is not my all time favourite movie or a perfect film by all means, I am glad to have watched The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. There are some parts where the film is very slow, and it is probably too long as well. Also I do think Se7en and Fight Club, also directed by David Fincher were better movies.\n\nThat said, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is still an interesting, worthwhile and very good film on the joys of life, the sadness of death and a love that endures beyond time. It's concept is curious and unusual but is explored in a poignant and sensitive way. The screenplay does have some honest moments, and the story is incredibly heartfelt and touching, I admit I was emotionally wrecked at the end. Fincher's direction once again is very impressive. To top all this, the film has exquisite visuals, seriously the cinematography is stunning, the scenery is sumptuous, the make up is superb and the costumes are gorgeous. And the score is breathtakingly beautiful, very hypnotic, soothing and haunting. Personally I really liked the acting, Brad Pitt while I do think he has given better performances is surprisingly touching in the title role. He plays the role with real humanity and depth, and I didn't find his narration annoying at all. Cate Blachett has also been better, having been mesmerising in the Elizabeth movies and The Aviator, but she looks gorgeous in this movie and acts as a very sympathetic time-crossed soul mate, and the two stars are believable together.\n\nOverall, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is very good, not outstanding but I am glad I watched it. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "The untamable force that is \"time\" lends itself for beautiful, morose, and evocative stories. I can think of no better city than New Orleans to begin the whimsical plot \u2014 Monsieur Gateau's (Elias Koteas) reverse-clock in the train station, as a memorial to all the sons, brothers, fathers, lost in \"The Great War,\" sets the tone for a tear-jerker of a story. You know the premise \u2014 Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) ages in reverse. As the viewer, we watch him grow in size and handsomeness, until he eclipses his prime and degenerates into a baby. This concept messes with you. I know it's a long movie, but for that final scene alone, when an infant Benjamin closes his eyes for the last time, the journey was worth it. His dalliance in Murmansk, the sea battle in the frigid arctic, sailing the gulf to the Florida Keys, are all some of the gorgeous, noteworthy moments of Benjamin's life. I suppose a plot where all of his acquaintances keep saying \"holy shit!\" every time they see him would've become irritating \u2014 a more realistic plot would've been the government sequestering him for genetic testing, but that's just where my brain goes. I don't know how I feel about his decision to leave his wife (Cate Blanchett) and his daughter (Shiloh Jolie-Pitt). It was probably the right thing to do, but man is it brutal. Sure, the script isn't original (based on the Fitzgerald novel), but Eric Roth and David Fincher made it their own. It might drag in some places, but I don't mind the 166-minute run-time. It's not a perfect movie, but it is a special one.",

It's simply a \"journey\" of a man who lives his life aging backwards. And you get to experience everything that he goes through with him. The film doesn't have plot twists or ups and downs.\n\nBrad Pitt's performance is incredible as always and he defiantly gave his character a unique impression. Cate Blanchett was incredible, really loved her acting and her character. And finally, Tilda Swinton, who didn't have a long screen-time but for sure gave the story of the film a warm atmosphere with her acting and her character.\n\nDavid Fincher's directing in the film was good. There were a few shots and angles that were great to look at but this movie could've easily got ruined if it was given to the wrong director. But, it was in the hands of a person who knows how to do it right and he did it right indeed.\n\nThe story is very warm, soft, and beautiful to think about especially after you're done watching the film. It's one of these movies that will make you wonder and think for days about life in general. You'll never be the same once the film is over.\n\nOne problem I had was the visual effects, makeup, and hairstyling. Which plays an important role in the story of the film. Because to bring Brad Pitt and make him look old you have to do it right. I'm some scenes I felt like it was too obvious that a character was wearing a wig, felt like it was put wrong which made it disturbing to look at. Or sometimes I felt like Brad Pitt looked like a person who came from a video game and not real life. The visual effects were just disturbing to look at.\n\nMy rating is 9/10",

In my opinion, this is a film that doesn't rely on its storyline. It's beauty and brilliance lies in the fact that it perfectly showcases the ever-so complicated affair of life. The film is complemented well by its mind-blowingly vivid cinematography and a score composed by the marvellously talented Alexandre Desplat, which is able to capture the emotional highs and lows perfectly.\n\nTruth be told, I would never have imagined Fincher directing a film such as this. It is the polar opposite of his signature dark and macabre themes (with a few exceptions). He gives us a glimpse of his maturity and experience through the medium of this film.\n\nLife is unpredictable, which makes it ironic that this film has a predictable plot, but to reiterate my opinion, this film doesn't aim to rely on its storyline. It's goal was to showcase the journey of life and it succeeded in achieving that goal in a rather beautiful manner.\n\nBrad Pitt and Cate Blanchett didn't seem like a very conventional pair, but the two deliver fantastic performances well supported by the likes of Taraji P Henson, Tilda Swinton and Mahershala Ali.\n\nI was enchanted by this magical film despite the it's long runtime which is why it's sad to see so many people dislike this film. This isn't the kind of film which can be watched with a cynical and critical perspective.",

That was really touching the way the clockmaker made the clock so that it ran counterclockwise instead of normal clockwise. An artistic statement that makes us wish we could turn back to a better time, a happier time. That song that Benjamin plays on the piano with the lady really stuck with me. \n\nThat was really funny when the old man banged the cymbals together during the lady opera singers funeral. The really nailed the look and feel of 1920's New Orleans, reminds me so much of Red Dead 2. That whole submarine scene was incredible, super cinematic. The way the tugboat split the sub in two, I would've never imagined. The set pieces looked really nice. Crazy how they made Brad Pitt look so young like in his Meet Joe Black days. Kind of sad how they did away the beautiful old golden clock and put in a boring electronic one to replace it. A metaphor to signify the beginning of a new era and the death of an older one. \n\nThey did a pretty good job with the CGI, making Brad Pitt look really old. This movie kind of makes you appreciate the life you have. Makes you want to live life and adventure out into the world. Really interesting and original idea. Very telling story. Even though Benjamin aged backwards, he lived his life like everyone else. It's an interesting thought though; the idea of growing younger while you watch all your loved ones and everyone grow older. Really interesting how the movie became about fatherhood and how fathers can leave or abandon their child. Really beautiful the way Fincher told a story about fatherhood, about growing up, about aging, living, about loss, birth, death, about the sacrifices that we have to make for our children so they can live happily. I really enjoyed this movie, I found it pretty touching. I think I'd watch it again.",

The curious saga of a man ageing backwards, gives Fincher the possibility of doing what he does best, tricks. It is the drama part that he doesn't seem to master or perhaps he doesn't care. \"Zodiac\" was his most coherent dramatic venture. Here he gets infatuated by the CGI and manages some spectacular punches but it is thanks to Brad Pitt the the exercise has a soul. He is truly remarkable. He manages to overcome the distraction of the gadgetry and show us the interior of the man. Brad Pitt's warmth wins over David Fincher's coldness and the most successful parts of the film are reflected in Brad Pitt's eyes. Geared towards an inexorable ending, there are moments of real beauty and tenderness. I'm convinced those moments could have been captured with a Super 8. The over direction of Fincher puts the emotional undertone in real jeopardy but, thankfully, the overall experience is mostly a welcome and rewarding one. 8.3/10",

If one can suspend belief, the story is remarkable, as are the make-up, special effects, cinematography, and the subdued performance by Brad Pitt. The only criticism might be the periodically overbearing music score, which needlessly tells the viewer what to feel and when to feel it.

With his seventh feature, writer/director David Fincher crafted a mesmerizing period drama about an unusual man that ages backwards in time. Using captivating cinematography, Fincher draws viewers into the whimsical world of a man that ages in reverse. The production sets, makeup and musical score are all carefully chosen, combining to create an immersive cinematic experience. Eric Roth's screenplay is also sensational, and expertly uses voice-over narration to keep viewers engrossed in Benjamin Button's life story. As usual, Fincher draws excellent performances from his talented cast. Brad Pitt delivers one of the best performances of his career as Benjamin Button. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys the curiosity, innocence and heartache of a man whose fate is fixed by his unstable aging condition. Cate Blanchett is equally excellent in the role of a tormented woman searching for love. Although \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" is undeniably an unforgettable epic, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At nearly three hours, it suffers from an extended running-time that tests the viewer's patience. Moreover, it builds to a sentimental conclusion that lacks a sense of subtlety. Nevertheless, fans of period dramas will definitely enjoy \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" and so will movie-goers seeking original entertainment. At a time when David Fincher is best known for his dark psychological thrillers, it's a stirring reminder of his little-known talent for telling love stories.",

With Fincher being out of his element, shooting his first PG-13 movie, he still managed to put together a great film with a lot of heart. While Fincher is behind the camera, you can always expect a dazzling looking film. He created these beautiful, authentic shots, really capturing the feel of the early 1900s, to the mid 1900s.\n\nDavid Fincher created this original premise, with great story telling, and a focused narrative. The way they embraced the meaning of life & death, felt borrowed from Forrest Gump, but they still managed to create their own version, with tremendous meaning and value. With so much going on, the story ran into some pacing issues, being fast paced at first, and then stalling out a little come the second act.\n\nThe character performances as a whole was very good, but nobody really stands out all that well; A lot of the characters just felt like plot devices, to keep the narrative going. The only character I cared about was Brad Pitt. He put on such a phenomenal performance as Benjamin Button, being nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nThe screenplay by Eric Roth & Robin Swicord was very powerful. They packed a lot of true emotions, being rich & authentic to the premise and time frame. They were also nominated for an Academy Award as well. \n\nThe cinematography by the Academy Award nominee Claudio Miranda, had such a clear, yet gloomy tone. The color palette he utilized consisted a lot of greys, blues, & yellows. The visual effects was the clear cut star of the film. The huge visual effects team utilized countless deaging & aging methods, essentially being seamless. The makeup & hairstyle team also displayed BEAUTIFUL work, to the point where I didn't know if it was CGI or makeup. With a stunning production design, and crystal clear picture, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nOverall, this may not have been my favorite David Fincher film, but with the thirteen Academy Award nominations, Fincher has done it once again.",

For me, the most realistic movie depicting people in love is \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", while the situation (people having their minds wiped clean of an ex) is very unrealistic, it shows very realistically what love does to people. Now this movie, although being very unrealistic at its core, shows what it is like to lose people, deal with life and death, and trying to find a place very realistically. It depicts human relationships very well and is very touching at points, it made me feel sad at points, angry at others, and overjoyed for characters during times of well being.\n\nThe acting in the movie is top-notch, starting with Brad Pitt, he is believable as a man in such a peculiar situation. Blanchett is great and all the minor characters are perfectly cast.\n\nOverall, TCCOBB is a great film, one to be cherished, and I think different people will get different feelings from it but overall it is a modern epic and deserves a spot in the best of the year.",

            "content": "Nowadays it is fashionable to bash the 1994 cultural phenomenon Forrest Gump (1994) as overly sentimental, cynical and politically conservative but when watching a film that patterns itself after that film and fails spectacularly. I have always been a defender of Forrest Gump and this film vindicated me in a way because it displayed how difficult it is to achieve what that film did. Despite receiving 13 Academy Award nominations in the notoriously awful 2008 lineup this film has had little cultural staying power and I doubt that it will be remembered as we move further away from 2008. I wanted to like the film, it was two and a half hours so I was trying my hardest to stay engaged, yet it was not deserving of audience's sympathy because it felt like an obvious ploy to win critical praise.\n\nBenjamin Button, Brad Pitt, is abandoned as a child by his father after his mother dies giving birth to him and has developed a strange condition that means that he ages backwards. He spends his early childhood at a nursing house under the care of the loving African-American owner Queenie, Taraji P. Henson, and meets the beguiling Daisy Fuller, Cate Blanchett, whom he falls in love with at a young age. He becomes a tugboat operator and later joins the military where he survives even as his ship faces an attack. After a brief affair with an older woman, Elizabeth Abbott, Tilda Swinton, he returns to a grown up Fuller who is a successful ballerina who sees herself as superior to Button. After a car accident that leaves Fuller unable to dance she meets him again when she arrives at the nursing home and the two enjoy several years together before Button begins to believe that his dramatic aging will put too much strain on their relationship.\n\nCentrally the film is lacking in that the protagonist is a blank, empty vessel lacking the good humor and charm of Gump which made us root for him as he makes his way through the various important historical events in American history. This issue is only exacerbated by the fact that Button skirts around all of these issues other than World War II as the film assumes that we are more interested in the stories of the patients at the nursing home and Button's first sexual experience. Had any of this detail actually been entertaining I would have been charmed by the film and it's characters and could have accepted some of the plot issues because I would have been compelled in some way. Instead I was adrift in a very self satisfied film that seemed to be saying \"Look how winsome and delightful this old man who was struck by lightning seven times is!\" and of course we learn about all seven times that this occurred, it never becomes funny.\n\nOur emotions are meant to be pulled in by the touching romance between Fuller and Button that is founded on the idea that they have a sudden, intense chemistry. This supposed connection cannot be found in the interactions between either the child actors or the movie stars who play the lovers as adults. Blanchett in particular struggles with her character as she delivers the most loathsome Southern accent in a film full of unfortunately drawn out As and seems to be imitating Katharine Hepburn in a choice that is jarring. What really sinks her performance is the fact that when united with Pitt she becomes not befuddling but dull as seeing two beautiful people with no problems be happy in a beautiful location becomes maddening very quickly. I was never invested in her as an individual and she became even less interesting as the romantic partner to our equally boring lead. Finally, the film has the gall to pull a The Way We Were (1973) style ending and has Button abandon his wife and child because he is brave enough to admit that he cannot be a father. The film portrays this as a noble decision worthy of respect and by the time the hurricane approaches the hospital holding an adult Fuller I was ready for her to die.\n\nThere are far better love stories than that which is present in this film available so I would suggest that you do not waste time with a prestige picture that does not live up to the hype.",

Sophisticatedly picant in his language, his direction matches Steven Soderberg's capability of three dimensional perspective. And if looked upon, their careers have been similar. They both are known for the direction and not the writing. But David is ahead in popularity. He has captured some catchy stories including mystery novels and even biographies about arguably the most famous face of 21st century. And this is where I trail off. I haven't always been so giddy up about the material he gets on his table. His direction exceeds the script he gets.\n\nAnd among few times when he has been blessed with an awe inspiring content, this would be the Holy Grail. This old style filmmaking that Fincher turns towards is a delightful gift to his fans. There is an unprecedented calmness in this film that makes the audience present in that frame. For three hours you are told to sit beside a death bed in a hospital room and you have never been honored like such in a Fincher set. A major character is of course Eric Roth's signature element, innocence in the film.\n\nA film that provides every possible database to be found in this long weekend that we call \"life\", it never puts any vice in these characters. Even the bad ones. The ones holding their promises to the other side of the door. And as far as the protagonist, Brad Pitt, Benjamin Button, is concerned, he is written like a wise old soul. The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, to me, was exactly that, as in what made them decide to write him as a mature personality affecting these many lives around him, the writers explains it by claiming him the most experienced or oddly experienced.",

            "content": "A touching testament to the value of appreciating the life you're given.\n\nDavid Fincher's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) is a moving romance drama that adapts F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story of the same name. Fitzgerald wrote a brilliant concept of a man aging in reverse that I found fascinating to watch play out. Eric Roth and Robin Swicord's script is filled with realistic dialogue that feels grounded for a fantasy film.\n\nFincher's direction is as striking as ever. The shots on the pier at the beach and everything in the retirement home is stunning. I cannot stop thinking about Brad Pitt just walking into his home back to meet Queenie again. For such a long film, Fincher keeps you engaged with endlessly beautiful cinematography.\n\nThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button features, perhaps, the greatest movie make-up ever. The old age make-up looks so real. Fincher must have used some CGI here or there, but I cannot even tell. The make-up for the various ages from teenager to the elderly for Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett is all remarkable.\n\nAlexandre Desplat's score is magnificent and very beautiful. The first piano melody that Brad Pitt plays in the retirement home is my favorite song from The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Desplat captures music that fits in early 1900's America throughout the decades. His score is timeless.\n\nBrad Pitt is absolutely incredible within The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. His portrayal of Benjamin Button aging and living on as everyone around him dies is very touching. His serious take with a somber tone and a deeper voice fits the character perfectly. Pitt keeps you interested with a subtle performance that keeps on giving memorable moments of emotional depth. Brad Pitt is simply captivating to watch over the years.\n\nCate Blanchett is really interesting as Daisy. Her character is not unlike Fitzgerald's Daisy in The Great Gatsby. Blanchett plays her as sweet and playful, then manipulative and dismissive in such a way that you want to hate her character. When Button never harbors resentment for his situation or her behavior, you appreciate how devastating Blanchett is in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Her ballet dancing is as mesmerizing as her tragic romance on screen with Brad Pitt.\n\nTaraji P. Henson is excellent as Brad Pitt's adopted mother Queenie. She plays the selflessly kind and motherly parent that gives unconditional love to an unloved child. Henson is so adorable and sweet that you really empathize with her perspective. Henson had a career waiting for her after The Curious Case of Benjamin Button for sure after she won your heart from this film. Queenie is the person that we should all aspire to be like. Taraji P. Henson is awesome and plays well alongside a young and charming Mahershala Ali.\n\nJason Flemyng as Thomas Button is poignant in his depiction of a man that would not raise his own son. He is easy to hate, but develops a sense of sympathy and understanding as the film goes on for his respect and care for Benjamin. Flemyng captures the essence of his business man character that cannot cope with abandoning his child.\n\nJared Harris is really entertaining as a tug boat captain that takes in Benjamin Button. His interactions with Brad Pitt feel so genuine and likable.\n\nLastly, there are 3 other supporting ladies that I feel I must mention. Elle Fanning is a childhood Daisy and it is neat to see her so young acting alongside an acting giant like Brad Pitt. Fanning plays the adorable innocent with a pleasant charisma. Then, Tilda Swinton is melancholic as the unhappy wife to a diplomat in Russia named Elizabeth Abbott. Swinton goes against her typecast of a weird lady, instead portraying a beautiful and forlorn woman. Finally, Julia Ormond is very captivating and relatable as the audience surrogate Caroline. Her role keeps getting larger as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button plays out and Ormond feels so empathetic. \n\nIn all, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a classic romance drama with a bizarre premise. It may not work for everyone, but it is a remarkable film with inspired direction and performances. Brad Pitt is particularly magical in this film.",

Visually, it was breathtaking. The money spent on this movie was worth it...to the eyes.\n\nSecond...well, there isn't a second positive thing I can point out.\n\nThat's right. I am so disappointed in this film that I am literally typing this minutes after leaving the theater.\n\nWhere to begin...\n\nThere are numerous small things that bothered me about the movie, but didn't necessarily HURT the film. It was entirely too long. And for the length, there was never enough to make me care about the characters. However, the main small component that bothered me is Brad Pitt's complete inability to act. Not that the script called for him to do much, other than look beautiful when he reached the right age, and he did that wonderfully. However, he had very little script with which recite, so when he did, it was mostly in soft-spoken mumbles. And he pulled it off just fine. However, if he gets nominated for an Oscar, I will officially boycott it. There is NOTHING Brad Pitt did in this movie for which he should be nominated. It's pathetic enough that he got a Golden Globe nomination. He did a fine job, but I can name double-digit numbers of performances that deserve recognition over this one.\n\nThose small things didn't destroy the film for me though.\n\nNo, what I absolutely hated about this movie was...the script.\n\nThe screenplay, based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, which I have not read but I hear is SO different than this movie that it was hard to even compare the two. The screenplay was written by Forrest Gump penner, Eric Roth. And how he got away with submitting this script proves that all Hollywood is interested in doing is rehashing popular movies or concepts from the past. And, like lambs to the slaughter, viewers are being sucked in.\n\nSo let's compare the job Eric Roth did in Forrest Gump and the work he did with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button...\n\n\nForrest Gump centers around the life story of a very a unique male character, complete with all the lessons learned therein. So does Benjamin Button. In both, that central male character narrates his own story.\n\nForrest Gump has a very strong motherly character that has a very strong influence on the type of person he becomes. So does Benjamin Button. In fact, they both even have a mother-coined catch phrase repeated throughout the movie. In Forrest, \"Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get.\" In Button, momma always said, \"You never know what's coming for you.\"\n\nForrest Gump had \"Lieutenant Dan\" on the SS Jenny. Benjamin had \"Captain Mike\" on the SS Chelsea.\n\nForrest is in love with Jenny who enters, exits and re-enters his life on a regular basis. Benjamin is in love with Daisy who enters, exits and re-enters his life on a regular basis.\n\nForrest becomes insecure and scared when he realizes he's about to be a father with Jenny. Benjamin becomes insecue and scared when he realizes he's about to be a father with Daisy.\n\nForrest interacts with historical figures throughout his story and finds himself in wartime situations. Benjamin finds himself in wartime situations and crossing paths with seemingly historical figures, like the first woman to swim the English Channel and Daisy herself being the first American to be invited to dance with the Bolshoi.\n\nLieutenant Dan talks about trying out his \"sea legs\" when Forrest asks him why he's on the boat. When Benjamin wants to join Captain Mike's boating crew, Captain Mike asks him if he has his sea legs.\n\nThis one may sound like a stretch, but how often does a script call for a character to announce so blatantly that they need to go pee. Well, Forrest did unexpectedly while in a conversation with John F Kennedy, while Daisy unexpectedly announces to Benjamin in the middle of a conversation that SHE needs to go pee.\n\nA couple of times in Forrest Gump, a floating feather takes center-screen symbolically representing how we float through life and how things happen because they are meant to happen. A couple of times in Benjamin Button, a hummingbird unexpectedly takes center-screen to symbolically represent...well, you get the picture.\n\nI could go on, but I'm too disgusted to.\n\nIt's plagiarism...or is it just Mad Libs with all the main subjects and names replaced with new ones?\n\nI'm sorry...a good movie starts with a good script. And if the SAME screenwriter writes essentially the SAME script from a previously popular movie, feeds it to me and thinks I'm simple enough to swallow it, I'm going to notice it. And it will remove any ability for me enjoy the film. No matter how many intentional heart-tugging moments this film tries toshove down our throats, I wasn't able to be affected by any emotion in the movie or connect with any of the characters. In fact, the only performance even remotely interesting was the one of Taraji P Henson, who plays Benjamin's adopted mother, Queenie.\n\nNo matter how visually beautiful this film was, and that was the only reason I gave this a 2, this is 3 hours of my life I will never get back.\n\nThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button is indeed a curious case. I'm curious how this thing was greenlit.\n\nUPDATE: Click here to read F. Scott Fitzgerald's original short story on which this horrible movie was based. He is turning over in his grave.",

But at almost 3 hours, this movie was rather plodding, and felt less like a story than a series of vignettes (the sea captain, girfriend, old folks home) - it felt a bit like Forrest Gump without the theme of America-changing-against-backdrop-of-history.  There was a bit of history, but it felt more tacked on.  There were 2 consistent stories - one with his momma (Queenie) and one with the girlfriend, but the mom story never developed and I would feel more for the girlfriend story if they weren't both such a couple of gross horndogs.  I never felt any emotional impact from any particular plot point, because it quickly moved on to the next point.\n The hook - he ages backwards.  It was interesting to see HOW he actually aged backwards, but beyond that, so what?  Like Blanchette said, 'we all end up in diapers'.  Sure it is sad that things end and people die, but that would have all happened if he had aged normally.\n There were some thematic elements i didn't follow, like the storms and how he always said 'good night, ms ', things never last, and the lightning guy.  I am sure it meant something, but for the life of me I couldn't figure out what.\n And oh my gosh - old dying hospital Cate Blanchett - I know she is sick, but could you mumble any MORE unintelligible stuff??  And apparently she had never read the journal.... WHY?  And the daughter must have been dumb as a stump growing up not to catch any of that stuff before the big reveal at the end.",

It's obviously necessary to accept the fanciful aspects of the tale, following a man who is born old and ages in reverse, but it's also a melancholy romance that's very moving. Love and loss, the inevitability of change, the richness of a life lived fully, and the preciousness of that life-all are within the film's sweeping embrace. Brad Pitt does an excellent job as Benjamin, with good support from Cate Blanchett and Taraji Henson, and an exceptional Tilda Swinton.  The movie is a bit long at almost three hours, and I think it would have benefited from some editing in places, but maybe it needs the length to take us on such an epic journey--an eventful lifetime for Benjamin and his life-long love, Daisy.  The cinematography is lush, artistic and melancholy in mood to support the tone of the entire film.  I also applaud the direction of David Fincher, and the music that is mostly subtle and very much in keeping with the mood of many scenes.  It seems like those who are middle age or older might be the most appreciative, but this film is worth viewing by anyone who is an adult with a bit of life experience.",

Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are terrific and their chemistry is pretty good. The effects on Brad Pitt's character is really great, they tried their best to make it look good, and it doesn't look scary. The story is pretty good even though it feels like Forrest Gump, which feels like a coincidence consider that Eric Roth also wrote that film. The direction by David Fincher is still top-notch, and the writing is good, although it can be over-sentimental at times. Taraji P. Henson is great in it that it's cool that she got nominated for an Oscar. Benjamin Button is memorable, which the main reason is actually not because of his disease, but because the movie spends time on the character that it's more than enough for me to care about him. The movie is a bit overlong, and the ending felt a bit tacked on even though it's a bit better than other films like Remember Me. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is not one of David Fincher's grand films, but I had a bit of a good time with it that I'm glad that David Fincher hasn't directed a bad movie yet.",

When what happens next just happens when anything is possible, as we are shown from our past. When what happens next we anticipate it's return, hope for the best, curious to know what it brings, we try to not think about until it is revealed to us. When what happens next, we wish for the best. When once we know what happens next, we prepare to cope. When what happens next we move forward by remind ourselves to always remember those whom we lost. When it's not about what happens next, when we take the time to think how we could prevent it. When those whom we lost, could not foresee what happens next to change direction of time, we have the opportunity to do so. When what happens next, doesn't matter as it won't bring those back to us. When we are born next to old and young, we have what others don't have a condition we have to live with. \nWhen we are born on a day of the beginning of an end, we naturally were born not knowing what happens next, like much of the world was. When we don't know what happens next, when we are dying, not a doctor, we hope for the best. When we don't know what to do next, but have to do something. When we have to do is the next best thing and get rid of our burden, or stop others from doing such wrong. When the person next to us is the person we want to be seen next to. When the next best thing is for others to take our burdens away. When something always happens when we next to it, but other things we don't see, is next to amazing when we find a baby. When some surprises we know what to do next and to leave it for others to deal with, while we are natural care givers whom take care of others and know what to do next.

When our next best thing is to lie to protect others. When there are processes and places for these incidences to know what to do next, then why didn't others do that we question next. When we don't see the big deal of a newcomer or someone different, that we joke next to its imperfections. When some gifts that never intended for us, comes our way we are filled with joy to do the next best thing and share the love. When we come from next to dirt poor, to having another mouth to feed. \nWhen we can't help but want to know what happens next. When being different we don't get to see what's up the next corner, or see what's  next to us across the street. When the things next to us we remain attached to. When other things don't want to be attached to us or be next to us we put in the next room. When we are naturally curious about the world when next to us is a lifetime of history, stories and life worth exploring. When those whom share stories share tales that you would never expect next to happening, when your face to face with history's famous people. When some people know what comes next, when they are planning something evil or when their job is heal you, and wait for the next person to test gods faith. When our father's ad mothers and god will see us the next step of the way, when we are growing and gaining our step unto the world. When what happens next is entirely a miracle or our own willful  power. When others know but ourselves what happens next after life, we learn about it at a young age. When whom is next to us, we live with, hear their story and don't know what they will say next. When what happens when we die we are put next to others whom are similar to us in death. When whom is next to us we draw a large crowd when we want to hear more stories. When whom sits next to us, takes us our to see the world. When the outside world don't know who is next to us when we haven't seen them before. When those next to us may look different, but is quite interesting. When those whom we want next to are for other reasons entirely. When we need a new perspective on life, that we need to be next to something that opens our eyes so we can see the world. When those whom can't be to see us apart we want next to each other for it is more reassuring. When whom we are, we are introduced to people whom don't mind being seen next to each other. When what happens next is a blessing when we are going to have a new member in the family. When those next to us teaches us something new. When those next to us we share in their stories, secrets, and feelings. We it is frowned upon to be next to each other when we are too young/old. When being next to something we just get struck by lightening.* When it's hard to be next to people, when they are constantly going, or with someone else that makes us alone. When some things we don't want to be next to when others are uncomfortable, disliking our presence, when they become bothersome. When we look good next to others whom makes feel good. When we look good when we are next to a mirror, when we feel stronger. When others don't have much time to spend with each other when we got work and are too far busy. \nWhen we separated from one another when we far too distant when the one next to us went away, and we were left alone for no one to understand us till now when reading the diary. When sometimes we are next to nothing or maybe something and we get struck by lightening. When we are next to something, waiting for nothing, a opportunity strikes that we are there at the right moment and time. When we are happy doing any thing and working next to nothing for the pure pleasure of working on board. When those whom we are next to show us other things nobody else told. When being next to the captain, we are next to a person that shows us how much we are missing out on life. When we are next in line to take over the family business, we remain or go, or do both what we want to do. When those we are next too we want to be close to them forever or a short while. When sometimes we bump into those we never thought we would see and meet again, and next thing leads to another and we are having a drink talking together. When we don't know what the next night or day would bring, when its a night for firsts of many things experiencing the world. When we regret what we did, when we wish we were next to each other now. When sometimes we are next to those when they visit, and have time to show them something amazing. When being close with the captain has its perks when we can sail next to larger boats. When we wish we could be next with some people forever, but we can't and have to start our own life and move out. When others will miss us, but communicating is the next best thing. When all we see is the next thing after the other while sailing, we remain next to others while away. When we go on life and rehearsals of people whom are looking for the next big thing, we work hard and focused on it and you. When the next thing to hit us is a storm. When whom we are next too we don't care when we are the Centre of attention and all we want to do is drink, whiles can't stand to be next to a cheat. When whom we are next to, we do care how we look and how others look at us. When those we run into we share a intimate moment next to each other sipping tea. When whom we are next to we keep up our appearances. When being next to somebody is discomforting, when  not being next to that person is even more discomforting, that time does stand the test, and we go our separate ways. When looks don't matter to some, when what brings us next to each other is our talks. When we share something close to us with someone else, we share how much we want to be next to that life, that makes us happy. When being next to each other we feel differently that we enjoy. When someone whom makes feel warm inside, we wish to be next to. When what we thought would happen next, it doesn't. \nWhen we are called upon by our country to fight side by side next to other soldiers during war. When others didn't sign up to be next in line to go to war, but home. When we don't decide whom we are next to when fighting but accept all the help we can get. When we are next to the enemy, we fight to see another day. When happens next would surprise you, and save you but not others. When we stare death face to face and don't want to be near it, we are glad we are next to other people as we let go. When what happens next is always something new when others have passed on, and made room for others. When next to some people, it's not the same as others we have come to meet and enjoy. When we least expect it we are struck by lightning just next to anything anywhere it finds us. When next to each other we are almost the same age. When we don't know what happens next when we stumble upon an old friend. When we don't believe things just happen next when life is predetermined and you have fate on your side. When we are not the only ones whom don't know what will happen or what we would see next when we are a star. When next to each other we are totally different people, when 1 world is torn apart and another one is just beginning. When we come face to face with the love of our life and longing to be next to each other, but can't seem to connect with each other. When we can connect with others easily when we are next to them and they are our father. When being next to those, we feel their pains, what they are going through and what's it's like to know what happens next for them, as they did for you. When we are next in line to inherit the family business we accept and know what will be next for us all through our life. When we are face to face with our real family, next to all the stories, history of the family that gave birth to us. When facing one family next to another we don't know what will happen. When anything could happen when your struck by lightening anytime. When being struck by lightening so many times, not know what each strike would bring to us next, we remain grateful to God we are still alive, makes us see how precious life is. When something so precious and significant has been next to us for so many years that we hardly noticed but from the day we are born to the day we die we are left next to the vary thing that others wear and a business we uphold in buttons. When we wish we could be next to all living things but life just let's us go and so do we. When we spend the last next time with those whom we hardly know before it's too late. When we don't know what to do next when those we can't connect on another level. When time passes us by so fast, that once we are not next to the things whom remind us of who we are, we are different people left to adapt our different life wherever we may be. When we rather next to people whom enjoy our company, have plenty in common, and we easily relate to in our new life. When we wish both life's could be next to each other beside us, but it doesn't work out. When we are so alone, discovering the world, life and ourselves all coming next to each other we too feel the same way about others that could be next to us too.  \nWhen time, place and fate are not next to each other now, but later in life when the signs were telling us it was true. When we wish timing, place, and fate were always on our side when the next thing to happens is we are hurt by an unfortunate incident, that crushes our world. When we need to be next to others when they need us most. When we don't need to be next to others whom don't understand and reminds ourselves of a past we don't care when our future is on our mind and your not next to it. When we long to be next with someone, to just go back to being alone, and being next to total strangers for a good time. When we always wanted to be next to those and return home and just keep things remaining the same that we don't want to ruin it. When we searched long and hard to return back to the place we grew up and be next to a person whom we connect well with in a new world when both our world's collapse. When we are 2 different people, that know we belong next to each other, but fate has it, it was never meant to be. When we wish to be next to someone we love, but are too late. When somethings we understand and don't care, we get rid of, as w wish others to have but still keeping next with the house the family history but with a different family. When being next to something less old and more modern suits us. When we live next to nothing, but we are happy. When we wish we could also have next to us our old lifestyle, but can only watch. When we do the next best thing and be next to all of our loves and passions at once. When there is another thing next to us, when there is another addition to the family. When we know what comes next, when we have so little time, but have to make sure they are taken care of. When we don't know what comes next when we are revealed our family history. When we don't know other things would happen next when parenting is unpredictable and we don't know what parent we would be. When we have to plan what happens next and still keep in touch when we are gone. When so many things could have happened next, but they never did. When what happens next are life's lessons we follow, and living with what just happened. When we plan what happens the next last year's of our life. When we wish we were next to each other for one last time or forever but we have to go our separate ways. What the next life holds, I hope it was more precious and filled with so much embrace as the life you lived with the ones you want next to you. When the next life isn't what we hoped for, or expected, but we will never forget what it's like being next to eachother. When we love eachother so much, we yearn to be next to eachother no matter what.\n\nVisuals-5\nDirecting-5\nMusic-5\nScreenplay-5\nActing-5\nLevel of Interest-5\nComplexity-5\nTiming-5\nTwist & Turns-5\nMessage-4.0",

David Fincher is slowly becoming one of my favourite directors. Every single film I see of his I believe is a great work of art. Not only do his films have great acting, cinematography, and production design, but all of his stories he tells sucks you into the movie immediately. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett have amazing chemistry and they really pull off every single age range. The story is an emotional, yet beautiful one about the wonders of life. Reminded me a lot of Forrest Gump. If you are struggling for a movie on date night and are looking for something with a bit more depth than something like Bridesmaids, then this is a great film to watch. Very emotional, very romantic, very well-made!",

Benjamin grows up to be a fine young man with a heart as good and warm as his mothers. \nDaisy is an awesome character too.\nIt was heart breaking to see Benjamin and Daisy as they dealt with their insecurities, first Benjamin when he was old and Daisy was young. And again when Daisy is broken and Benjamin is perfect. And again when Daisy is old and Benjamin is getting younger. And yet again when they need to raise a child  but Benjamin cannot be around forever. And yet yet again when Daisy is very old and Benjamin a teenager, and the two look like mother and son.\nIt really broke my heart, this movie.\nVery desperate. But very beautiful too!",

But the biggest problem is that it doesn't really have much to say. I suppose the film's journey is kind of interesting, and the premise is original (a guy born old who ages backwards), and I suppose there's an unsatisfactory love story in there when he falls for an arrogant, self-centered woman for some reason. But otherwise it's just kinda blah. And you spend too much time noticing how they managed to make Pitt look old, young and in-between. Anyway, it's clearly a chick flick, for women who don't mind a long drawn out story. If that isn't you, you'll probably get bored.",

The directing and technical aspects of the movie, from the production design to the convincing visual effects, are nothing short of amazing. The concept man aging backwards and how that's portrayed is really quite interesting, and it works very well because of solid execution. The movie is too long, and some will argue that it wants to slowly and gradually show this man's change. We slowly work through his older (or first) years, but then breeze through his final few years. So in that regard, the pacing is a bit awkward. Some flash-forward scenes of an older Daisy (Blanchet) dare interwoven into the story, and could have been excluded, as they don't amount to anything. I also didn't get that into any of the supporting characters, I really liked Benjamin but the rest weren't as memorable or deep a I would have hoped. This movie is pretty great overall, the ending is very emotionally affecting and the messages about life shown in this movie are something special.

The subject is intriguing enough to get you to watch it but you stay because it's simply captivating. I was so invested in the story that I cried several times while watching it. The film is touching and heartwarming, and also subtle. It seamlessly breezes through times and really brings to life what the tagline is about \"Life isn't measured in minutes but in moments.\"\n\nThe film does go through Benjamin Button's life and really shows every step, moments, that defined who he is. The movie is very much grounded in reality which makes the fantasy elements of the story real. You quickly believe that a boy born old but with the mind of baby is possible. So the magic is there, grounded in the reality of Benjamin's life. I don't know who to accredit this to but it's very clear, palpable, that when Benjamin is growing up, looking like a man in his nineties his youthful energy shines through.\n\n\nBrad Pitt, being the title character is just stunning in this film. He helps make the weird aspects of the film OK. The same goes for Taraji P. Henson, she makes the old wrinkled baby the most normal thing, she brought the dramatic gut wrenching emotions of a mother's love in all her scenes. They all have their moments Julia Ormond, Tilda Swinton and Cate Blanchett all bring another layer, another moment in Benjamin's life. Blanchett evokes the undeniable question of love, and a lasting one as that. Benjamin's condition raises a valid question about age and love, which is interestingly dealt with in the film.\n\nMore than a riveting story with great acting, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a technical prowess. The make up, the cinematography, and the special effects are mind-blowing Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett look older and then younger and it's done beautifully. The darkness and lighting in David Fincher's style of film making really compliments the story but more so the technicality of the film. He was the perfect director for and did an amazing job throughout.\n\n\nThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a wonderful film about time, life, and love. It's another David Fincher masterpiece that is timeless.\n\n@wornoutspines",

The begining of the longish movie is the most so, with the 'child' growing up looking like he is 80 and wanting to be out playing with the other kids.  The movie isn't exactly fast paced, in fact it's kinda slow going, but the topic itself is interesting.  He grows up to be middle aged, and then begins the love story.  I was wishing that the movie didn't go in depth as it did in the romance, but it does make sense since we know how it won't last as long as it usually should.  It was nice however in my point of view and interest to add the brief Second World War scene.  A tug boat vs a U-Boat, in a movie that is not at all about war is interesting, but ultimately turns out very well done for the only action scene in the film.  It looks good, sounds very good and although the ending with the sub exploding is unrealistic it is needed to have to death of the sailors for the films sake.  The ending of the film is sad, and weird thinking about the once grown man shrinking into a tiny newborn baby, until he take his last breath.  It's a good movie, surprisingly well done considering the story, but mabey a tad long and slow.",

A rare masterpiece that never drags and is so rich in emotion and the wonder of story telling. David Fincher's The Curious Case may not be his most bleak or as thrilling as the majority of his body of work but it makes up for that by being a power house of emotional and empowering magnitude. After his wife dies in child birth, Mr button discovers that his new born child is not a child at all but in fact an old man on his death bed, ashamed and afraid, he abandons the child at a home for the elderly and vanishes into the night. The owner of the house finds the child and decides to raise him as her own. As he grows older/younger, Benjamin ends up going on many an adventure all over the world as a workman on a tug boat, before returning home to fall madly in love with his long lost friend Daisy. The couple continue to rekindle their friendship as we are forced to watch them age in polar opposite directions. Eric Roth's script is marvelous, full of whit and power, it keeps its tongue in cheek  when it needs to, but Benjamin is constantly reminding us, the viewer, what it is to be alive and more importantly what it is to be human. It's such an enlightening and uplifting film, with plenty of twists and turns and many an emotional roller coaster to play on. This film isnt short either, clocking in just shy of 3 hours, but by now Fincher is so seasoned in the art of film making that the film flies by like a day dream. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchette are just both giving the performances of their life times, it's such an interesting and dynamic relationship they share, that by the final sequence its impossible not to feel like you have witness their entire life and their struggles. Unlike Zodiac, this time the supporting cast play a more unique and memorable role. From Tilda Swinton playing a lover of Benjamin as he stays in russia prior to pearl harbor or an old man who recites the 7 seperate occasions he was struck by lightning. Daisy's daughter also takes up a large portion of the film as she reads Benjamin's journal to a dying Daisy. It's tear jerking stuff. Raw, powerful and full of innocence. The look and feel of this period piece is astounding, mixing all forms of styles but never feeling out of place. As the decades change so do the sets and its comes as naturalistic as you would expect. The piece is stunning and with a brilliant script, stunning performances and so good its unnotacable CGI, its hard to fault an achievement like this. Fincher use's CGI here like a polish, sensibly and sparingly, using lighting, angles and make up to do a good chunk of the work. It pays off as this film is totally reliant on it being beliavable and it works 100% of the time. A million times more touching than Forrest Gump and an underrated masterpiece. Fincher's outing may not be pitch black but its so thought provoking and compelling its hard not to finish this film and watch to get up and do something with your life, now that ladies and gentlemen is what a film should be.",

At her side is her adult daughter, Caroline. Daisy asks Caroline to read to her aloud the diary of Daisy's lifelong friend, Benjamin Button. Benjamin's diary recounts his entire extraordinary life, the primary unusual aspect of which was his aging backwards, being diagnosed with several aging diseases at birth and thus given little chance of survival, but who does survive and gets younger with time. Abandoned by his biological father, Thomas Button, after Benjamin's biological mother died in childbirth, Benjamin was raised by Queenie, a black woman and caregiver at a seniors home. Daisy's grandmother was a resident at that home, which is where she first met Benjamin. Although separated through the years, Daisy and Benjamin remain in contact throughout their lives, reconnecting in their forties when in age they finally match up. Some of the revelations in Benjamin's diary are difficult for Caroline to read, especially as it relates to the time past this reconnection between Benjamin and Daisy, when Daisy gets older and Benjamin grows younger into his childhood years.\n\nThis is my least Favorite (Still a good movie) David Fincher Film it was just something different it was his first PG-13 Film.\n\nThis is still a beautiful Shot film with some good CGI\n\nBrad Pitt performance is fantastic as Benjamin Button\n\nCate Blanchett as Daisy Fuller - is good shes like a spoiled brat, but plays it fantastic \n\nOverall: other than great performances and a beautiful shot movie its just not a really interesting movie like other David Fincher Films, its still a good movie to watch.\n\nOverall Grade: C+",

            "content": "With an intriguing premise and an Academy Award nominated performance from Brad Pitt, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button sounded like an interesting feature.\n\nThe story in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a lot like Forrest Gump. The story chronicles the titular character as he goes against everyone's expectations set up to him from birth on the basis of his own biology turning him into a different person. In actual fact, a lot of the plot dynamics are strikingly similar, such as Benjamin Button being involved in war, becoming fascinated with sailing and being involved in a relationship with a woman whose ambitions cause her to be constantly be uncertain about being anchored down to him. Eric Roth's screenplay differs very much from F. Scott Fitzgerald's original 1922 short story, and in actual fact Eric Roth is the same person who won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for penning the script to Forrest Gump. Considering the striking number of similarities between The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Forrest Gump, the fact that they share the same writer explains it. But it means that there is little new ground for the film to break on a narrative level. The differences are that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is longer in length, slower in pace, smaller in ambition, lower in quantity or plot dynamics and featuring an entirely different gimmick for its titular character. But even then, it is too clear that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is largely a rendition of Forrest Gump with a minor fantasy element in it, but with the same surplus of optimism to it with a few slight moments of emotionally affecting drama. I don't deny that I enjoyed The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but it was for essentially the same reasons that I enjoyed Forrest Gump which essentially made the film a companion piece, and there was little to the film which felt all that new. \nThe tone of the film never exactly feels like it gives the story much development. A lot of things happen in the narrative, but the story never really progressed or developed that much and so it always felt like the film was in the stage where it was building up for its dramatic climax. Yet as the film was so optimistic, it was hard to really feel that there was strong drama in the screenplay. It was all touching sentimentality, but there is a difference between that and genuine drama, so while the film started, I never really felt like it had genuinely ended. The sentimental exploration of countless optimistic story elements really rendered the film an example of Oscar Bait, and while it was certainly a worthy film of many of its nominations, its narrative just didn't feel like much of a story. It's hard to explain, but I guess what I'm saying is that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button had the best intentions, but a sensible story takes a backseat to the style of the film, and so by the end of it I asked myself what Eric Roth was trying to say with his screenplay. I kept drawing blanks, because the end of the film explains little about what happened to the characters and just rushed to a finale which ends on a tediously shallow sentimental message which gave me no answers. I learned nothing from The Curious Case of Benjamin Button except that the visual style of a film and best intentions can sometimes carry a film well enough. I just can't see that it carried much of a message, with the exception of the idea that \"age is just a number\" of which the film repeatedly hits viewers over the head. So most of the flaws in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button can be attributed to its screenplay and the fact that whatever F. Scott Fitzgerald put into the story when he wrote it got changed by Eric Roth so that it could be more along the lines of his Academy Award winning achievement on Forrest Gump. I've never read the short story of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but I'm sure that F. Scott Fitzgerald would have had some sort of underlying message in the gimmick of having a character born with the physical characteristics of someone aged 70 who ages backwards through life. In the film adaptation, that concept is barely explored for about 10 minutes at the start of the film and 10 minutes at the end, and the genuine role that it plays in the story is so shallow that it seems kind of pointless. The concept of Benjamin Button ageing backwards is never explained in terms of biology, but that would be different if it was more about how it affected his psychology. Unfortunately, even then it comes up short and so the fact of the matter is that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button fails to take advantage of its high concept plot and instead leaves it as a minor character element for its 166 minute running time without ever really exploring it.\nBut nevertheless, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button remains a good film, if solely on the basis of who the director is: David Fincher. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film that would have been easy to get wrong, but the fact that David Fincher took over directing duties on the film can be attributed to the reason I would call it a good feature. Despite the fact that the narrative is not as deep as it wants to be or as complex, David Fincher makes up for that because of how he handles the material. He is able to have audiences sympathising for the characters easily by giving the film its appropriately sentimental and uplifting atmosphere, meaning that it does capture the same sort of spirit that Robert Zemeckis was able to harness with Forrest Gump, albeit to a lesser extent. The atmosphere of the film is great because it had some emotionally touching moments to it while remaining more consistently uplifting as a whole. And despite the fact that the film runs for a total of 166 minutes which is one of the most common criticisms of the film, I found that the length was enough to justify its scope and ambition without many scenes that were unnecessary. I probably would have been even happier if film went for longer and had a more sensible ending, so the length of the film was something I had no problem with. And also, I enjoyed the pace of the film. It was appropriately slow so that it gives viewers the appropriate amount of time to take everything in and understand it all. The slow movement over the course of the 166 minute running time was no problemfor me because I was fairly engaged the entire time, and the atmosphere in the film was consistently handled with care which left it emotionally affecting in the right way. So the atmosphere and general feel of the film are good, with the script consistently having a lot of strong dialogue, even if some of its situations come off as being somewhat senselessly melodramatic. As a whole, David Fincher carries the nature of the script very nicely and is able to get the best out of the cast, so his storytelling talents contribute a lot to the film.\t\nBut what David Fincher really gives to the film is an excellent visual style. The entire film is packed with lush scenery and dedicated production design, as well as magnificent quality visual effects which all help to assist the characters in their appearances and set the mood for the time and setting of the story easily. Everything comes off as fairly legitimate thanks to the strong visual style of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and this is what renders the film easily memorable. Everything in the film looks good and is captured with beautiful cinematography which is always appropriately atmospheric and captures every inch of the visual experience excellently. It is clear where the budget in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button went, and David Fincher made sure that none of it was wasted which made it quite a treat for the eyes, as well as for the ears thanks to a good musical score.\nAnd the cast in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button are just tip top.\nBrad Pitt is excellent in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Taking on the titular role, Brad Pitt works with the complex material of his character easily by being able to strongly act in many different states of mind to convey the different ages he must face, even while beneath the makeup of the character or when he is created solely out of visual effects. Brad Pitt is great in the role of Benjamin Button because he is easily able to develop the constantly changing mental age of the character with all of the emotional complexity and dramatic passion necessary for the part. Brad Pitt develops really well in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button because he is able to convey a sense of mental aging very naturally, and in the process he is able to create an easily likable spirit for the character which makes him an engaging lead. While The Curious Case of Benjamin Button does not expand too much upon the mental state that Benjamin Button experiences as a man cursed with backwards aging, Brad Pitt is able to make him into a sympathetic figure with his natural acting charisma and easy ability to give audiences a sense of sympathy for what he is experiencing. Brad Pitt is a great lead in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and makes the titular character into a easily likable figure.\nCate Blanchett is also terrific. With her naturally likable demeanour and sense of formal beauty, she first the profile of the role very easily and shares a really emotionally firm chemistry with Brad Pitt. It is easy to sympathise for her because Cate Blanchett makes a compelling case for rendering the character a likable figure as well as conveying the stress of facing all the situations that Daisy Fuller has to. She brings a really likable charm to the role which makes her a genial presence, and the etiquette of her line delivery is smooth and sophisticated. Cate Blanchett does an excellent job justifying her casting in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and so her performance stands out as one of the best.\nTaraji P. Henson also does a really nice job. Although it doesn't seem like she receives enough screen time to earn herself an Academy Award nomination, the quality of her performance in the matter of her small amount of time on screen is great because she is able to make herself a really pivotal character in the story and a likable figure as well. Her line delivery is perfectly emotionally tense without going overboard into melodramatic territory. She makes a strong and memorable effort during her small time on screen mainly because of the way that she interacts with the surrounding cast with determined passion for the material. Taraji P. Henson is spot on in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, delivering one of her finest performances in years.\n\nSo The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is flawed in the sense that its narrative is essentially a series of overly sentimental vignettes lightly tied together by a single story which feels very derivative of Forrest Gump. But thanks to exceptionally stylish direction from David Fincher and a dedicated lineup of actors, it is hard not to feel the charm of the tale even if its message remains unclear.",

            "content": "The premise of this movie is very obvious after only one watch of the trailer. Benjamin Button is a man who was born old and is growing younger over time instead of growing older. The way the story is told is very similar to Forrest Gump. We have an old, dying woman who asks her daughter to read a book/diary/will (I'm not really sure what it is supposed to be but the amount of detail they get out of it I'd expect a War-and-Peace length of novel.) This book is written by Benjamin Button, who becomes the narrator for the film recounting all the many events of his life. The biggest difference between Benjamin Button and Forrest Gump is that Forrest Gump actually did interesting things with his life. This is a 2-hour film where we are told about how this boy lived in a nursing home, then went to work on a boat, then moved back into the nursing home, then pursued the love of his life and was rejected, then moved back into the nursing home, then actually had some time with the love of his life, then moved back into the nursing home. It's utterly bland, repetitive, and drags on much longer than it needed to in order to tell this uninteresting story.\n\nBrad Pitt is better than this. I know he was stuck doing a lot of his acting behind a pile of makeup or CGI, but it's like he had 2 expressions through the entire film. I could not connect with him because he was so stone-faced for most of the movie. Cate Blanchett shows a greater range, but I found her character totally irritating. I don't find myself rooting for them to get together, because she is completely aggravating. Tilda Swinton actually supplied a better love interest in the limited number of scenes she shared with Brad Pitt, to the point where I kind of hoped she would show up again later in the film. There were several smaller roles that were surprisingly interesting. I liked any time Queenie, played by Taraji Henson, was on screen. She was perfect as the loving mother who cares for her adopted son no matter what. Jared Harris (as Captain Mike) was a nice addition, and just when he is really getting interesting they write him out of the story. There are even a few moments with Jason Flemyng, who plays Benjamin's father, that are very emotional but they are so limited you can never fully enjoy his presence either.\n\nEven the highly-praised, award-winning makeup and CGI techniques that composite Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett onto much older or younger faces were disappointing to me. It looked like it was done artificially. Sure, it was cool that they could make a 70-year-old version of Brad Pitt, but it was too obvious that the image and/or the actor's face had been manipulated to create that effect. There was nothing natural or organic to the appearance of these characters. At this point I've gone on-and-on about all the shortcomings in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but I still haven't touched on the most disappointing aspect. You see, I was interested in the premise of this film. There are so many intriguing things they could have done with the idea of a man living life in reverse while the rest of the world goes the other way. Yet in this film they continue making it a non-issue. No one says \"Why in the world do you look so much younger, what's wrong with you?!\" No one questions \"Why is this young boy with a much older woman?\" It's simply a slice-of-life drama, where the main character aging the other way is almost a non-issue. There are lots of ways they could have used this to great effect, but they dropped the ball completely. Such potential utterly wasted. There are movies I've watched that are worse, but few that have undershot the mark by such a large margin.",

This is a well-made movie, but the story is often sad and hollow, even somewhat tragic. Like any life story, it is full of high points and low points, but it is lonelier than most. At no point does it establish any lasting friendships or relationships. This of course is the tragedy of going through life backwards, but I wish there was more beauty in it as well. It does achieve a fine poetic commentary on the processes and different stages of life, yet it is not fulfilling on an emotional level. I like the retrospective perspective, and interesting storytelling technique comes from alternating between the present and a collection of flashbacks. David Fincher has matured into a talented director, and it shows here. The changing times read clearly at each step, and the settings and backgrounds reflect and enhance the mood in a positive way. Most of the cast is good, but Kate Blanchet comes across as cold and harsh, even when she does not intend to. I think this would be stronger with a lead female actor who has more warmth and life in her.",

This tale is basically a short story - a premise that is quite hard to adapt and making a screenplay upon. Eric Roth does a fair job for the most part but the sheer nature of the adaptation was flowing against the essence of storytelling. A story where\"someone is aging backwards and having a romance with a traditional being with a normal life cycle is bound to create awkward plot joints when represented in form of  drama. This story is no different - right from the slow pace of the movie to the less interactions between the leads through half of the movie  , the film suffers at every point of storytelling. There are points of awkwardness which are not handled properly in the movie thereby leading to the sense of unbelievable nature , making the audience more dis connected from the narrative. However despite the hurdles , the film works on so many levels :- to begin with both Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt gave powerful performances that overcomes the occasional failures of the screenplay. Yes it is true the editing of the movie suffers and is probably the main reason why it cannot make proper connection with the audience  but the imagery of the story is done elegantly with brilliant piece of cinematography and excellent use of lights , colors and setting. Regarding the setting the production design is excellent and with proper photography the production value of the movie is very high. In fact when you have 165 minutes of elegant cinematography you are bound to like something of the film. Apart from high production values and excellent performances the cinema has a brilliant visual aesthetic which adds to the story  , soft images  of warmth and cold to represent different stages and relationships within the story. Therefore on a film making level this is excellent but fails to properly channel with the audience",

In a change of a genre to drama Fincher makes a convincing life of a gentleman who gets younger instead of older as years went by. Excellent performances by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett who really developed their characters so well that they actually own them. With a great support cast especially from Taraji P. Henson in her semi-humourous but caring role. The designs, visual effects and scores were some of the greatest highlight of the film but I particularly loved the convincing makeup.",

            "content": "As an elderly woman lies on her deathbed she recounts the peculiar story of Benjamin Button, a man whose life is inexplicably tied to a mysterious backwards-running clock. After Benjamin's mother dies in childbirth, the father abandons baby Benjamin because of his stark physical defects. Luckily Queenie, a black woman who manages a senior's care home, finds newborn Benjamin and raises him herself. For the rest of his life Benjamin calls Queenie mother.\n\n\nWhen Benjamin is born, he emerges prematurely aged. Medical tests show that he has the physical characteristics of a person in his eighties. Originally penned by F. Scott Fitzgerald, makes Benjamin Button tells a peculiar life story that forays in the world of the fantastic: the crux of the story is that, just as the clock ticks backwards, Benjamin too ages in reverse. He gets younger and younger over time.\n\nThe task of dealing with this massive disconnect between his physically aged exterior, and his inner infantile self, forces Benjamin to attempt to act like an adult (to match his aged exterior), but no matter how hard he tries his true inner child shines through, especially whenever it comes to booze and women, areas where he has zero experience. Benjamin wins the adoration of most every character he meets, and along the way he breaks through the prejudicial barriers that age and race typically erect.\n\nThis film is a diversion for Fincher. Many of the defining qualities of David Fincher's films are not so very present in Benjamin Button. This charmed, almost magical tale shares none of the characteristic of other Fincher scripts. It is not filtered through the darkened lens of hyper awareness; there is none of the desolation and bleak deconstruction of modern culture that fills Zodiac, the most recently released Fincher film before this one. \n\nBenjamin Button seems to be the only film in Fincher's body of work that is not a dark, psychological thriller. Here, Fincher proves that he can work in drama just as well as he can work in action and suspense, however he does have expert help.\n\nThe director of photography Claudio Miranda, who had worked on a number of Fincher's earlier pictures, sets the tones and temperature of the images so they project like a thriller, dark with shadows, slight, almost sepia toned. A highly refined picture quality.\n\nOnce again, this film features Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter, the brilliant editing team that would go on to win multiple Oscars for best editing in The Social Network and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. They brilliantly let visuals alone tell as much of the story as possible. As with Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Benjamin Button has tons of shots and locations. The exact opposite of Panic Room.\n \n\nEric Roth & David Fincher\nThe technique of recounting the story through recollection as a series of flashbacks, as well as Benjamin's unexpected success despite his handicap, make Benjamin Button bear an off-putting resemblance to the structure of Forest Gump (1994). This is no coincidence. \n\nThe same writer who won an Oscar for his Forest Gump screenplay, Eric Roth, is also the writer of Benjamin Button.\nAs characters both Forest and Benjamin worked on boats, both took part in World Wars, and both perpetually pursue women from their childhood. What is great thought is that Fincher is able to divert this potential redundancy. While Forest bumbles along, simply falling into phenomenal situations, Benjamin paves his own way. It's existential drive versus dumb luck.\n\nMore reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",

            "content": "David Fincher delivers his most sincere venture yet, with the almost three hour epic drama \"The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button\". Centered on an infant born with the qualities of an old man, complete with cataracts and arthritis, abandoned by his father, and taken in by a black woman named Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), the story of the film follows as the boy ages backwards, becoming physically younger every day, but inhabiting the mind of the age to which a normal human would. Brad Pitt plays Benjamin Button for a better part of the film, mostly through CGI, yet still commands this role with a sincerity and integrity that is admirable. Cate Blanchett plays the love interest, Daisy, to whom Benjamin falls in love with at a very young age, as the narrative follows the two of them through their entire lives, eventually meeting at the middle of their lives when they look about the same age. The story is told through flashbacks as Daisy lays in a hospital bed, very aged and on her last legs of life, as her daughter reads to her from Benjamin's journal. This device is used more like chapter markers than anything as we venture through this sordid tale and adds very little besides a few telegraphed twists not are not delved into. The CGI is done as well as possible but still comes off less than authentic, showing the signs of the computer generated that should be more than covered up with how far technology has come. With some unnecessary jaunts in the story like being involved in the Pearl Harbor bombing aftermath and most of the fishermen story, this film could have been slightly shorter, but in having covered a characters entire life, that long run-time can slightly be forgiven. At no point does the film feel like a David Fincher film, remaining too upbeat and emotional than any of his previous work, creating this grand tale that truly brings to life the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald.",

I prefer this one to \"Forrest Gump,\" but it lacks the originality I needed. There, I'm finished with complaining about my only problem with the film. The plot, based on a story written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a magnificent fantasy tale about a man who lives in the 21st century by aging backwards growing younger and younger. The script is a little over-the-top, but its warmth makes it impossible not to resist. The dialogue is powerful and the plot is well thought out. For two and a half hours, you are Benjamin Button and you live someone's extremely interesting life. The film evokes emotion continuously which is what makes a good film we truly care about the characters in a fantasy. David Fincher is an ideal dark and serious balance to Eric Roth's corniness and melodrama. The acting especially on the part of Brad Pitt and Taraji Henson is spectacular. Pitt uses facial expressions he probably has never used in his life to play the role. Henson throws so much energy and emotion into her performance that its impossible not to resist. The visual effects and makeup are simply outstanding. The techniques used to make the characters age is convincing and a landmark for film. \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" evokes the feel of the 21st century with style, class, heart, and originality.",

I mean, if the protagonist is meant to be fantastic why is it necessary for us to know when he was born, where is he going, what (real) wars he fought? Superman is like this movie's protagonist, he defies natural laws, like gravity for example. Benjamin Button is doing the same thing with biological laws when he rejuvenates, but despite the realistic context where he is placed, no-one seems to be so affected by his unusual nature (and that makes realistic characters behave artificially). Just pay some attention to the title: The curious case..., why case? \"Cases\" exist only in reality. If the movie would have dwelled in the fantastic, fictional, or whatever you call it domain of the narrative it certainly had been better. Secondly, and more important, my opinion is that this movie doesn't eventually say much. During the almost three hours length I questioned myself about Benjamin's nature and what philosophical facts should it reveal. But as I tried and tried to build-up my logic I couldn't reach any destination. In fact, Benjamin looked like a simple, ordinary men that lives his life from start to end. He's different from us only because his appearance evolves from old men to infant child. But he is born a child and mentally he's just like us (as he admits). All my respect to everyone in the production crew because they made a very well-done job, from special effects to acting performances. The story is the major problem here.",

Of his films that I liked, this film is one, I also liked Seven(1995) and my favourite is Fight Club(1999), which is a film that I never expected from this director. But much to my dislike, I hate Zodiac(2009) which I believe is a complete waste of time. I did not like his Alien 3 and I once tried to watch The Social Network(2010), but I fell asleep just 10 minutes into the film. \r\n\r\n        Curious Case.... tries to recreate the innocence of Forest Gump, but fails immensely. Even when Brad Pitt gives a potent and heart full performance, his character has nothing likable. Cate Blanchett is also good. There is no reason cited to why Benjamin Button aged this way. More than that, this  film unnecessarily drags a lot and this film should have ended within 2 hours. There are a lot of striking similarities b/w this film and Forest Gump. But Gump was a good watch mostly due to Tom Hanks' all in all performance and a smart direction despite of the bad dialogues, here in this film, there is nothing too deep that drives you except for the cinematography and occasional fun. In the end, Curious Case ..... is extremely melodramatic, but the solid performances keep this film afloat. \r\n\r\n     You might think why I wrote down the budget and gross of this film. You see, let me ask you why a film like this need a budget of 150 million$? I say that this is just a waste of money, trying to recreate Forest Gump effect when the film never needed all of this. Also, I am dumbstruck by the American patriotism!!! From what I know, Patriotism is an easy seller in America and Hollywood. A trade ship knocks out a German submarine, so selfless and patriotic!!!! I don't know why Americans buy all these crap? When films are made in my language which try to sell extreme patriotism instead of substance, we shoo them out of the theaters. There was a film called 'Kandahar' released in 2010 on my state, it was a sort of military film which exaggerated the Indian military and tried to sell patriotism. The climax of the film had a scene about 10 minutes length where the hero's( a soldier) dead body is taken to his father along with all the military ceremonies and all. Where ever the body went, people who saw it rose up and saluted(common people)!!!! Can you believe that???? Then after 15 minutes of melodrama, the body reaches the father. Instead of crying, people were laughing and ridiculing at the senselessness shown. If this had been part of a Hollywood film, they might have even given it an Oscar!!!.",

It's amazing how a concept of getting younger as you get older can be so heartwarming. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are just as good as they were as a couple in Babel, the soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat is absolutely stunning, and I was so moved by the ending. By far one of the best films of 2008, and one of this decade's understated treasures. What a lovely, lovely film.",

            "content": "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is one of the most confounding pieces of screen writing that I have experienced in quite a while. Here is a movie built on the idea of a man who has the most phenomenal affliction in human history and surrounds him with characters that treat it as if it were a new haircut.\n\nThe man is Benjamin (Brad Pitt) who is was born in 1918 the size of a normal infant but possessed all the infirmities of a man in his 80s. He ages in reverse (apparently though a magic of a clock that runs backwards) and through the progress of this affliction, we see him spend his toddler years in a nursing home with wrinkles and liver spots then grow into his middle age and on down to his youth and develop the feeble mind of an elderly man when he reaches his preteen years.\n\nAt birth his mother dies and his father gives him away to a nursing home where he is cared for by the loving caretaker Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). All around Benjamin are elderly tenants like himself who die with a sad regularity. Benjamin notices those around him getting older while at the same time his skin clears, his stooped walk straightens and he has fewer aches and pains.\n\nSomewhere in this elderly state, he meets a child named Daisy who will become his lifelong love. She arrives in his life periodically on her way to be a great ballet dancer. We know, inevitably, that they will be in love and that their best moments will take place when they eventually reach the same age. We wait patiently for the two to seriously begin discussing his bizarre aging process but when they do, they don't discuss it with any depth or any reason. They might as well have been discussing their wedding day.\n\nNo one else really gets to the business of questioning Benjamin's predicament either and that's troubling because here is the most amazing thing that has ever happened in the history of the universe, a man is aging backwards and all through the movie, those closest to Benjamin treat this incredible miracle as if it weren't all that unusual. This is absolutely the wrong note on which to approach this premise. All through the movie I kept waiting for a doctor to examine Benjamin and turn him into a bit of medical history, but no, we follow his life's journey as he takes a job working on a tugboat, fights in the second world war and eventually shares a brief love affair with Daisy. Ho-hum.\n\nThe fact that Benjamin's journey through life is so ordinary and unexceptional makes his aging process seem all the more like a movie gimmick. The story was written by Eric Roth who also adapted Forrest Gump, another story of an afflicted man's journey through life. But while Forrest dealt with his affliction and used it as a catalyst for an extraordinary life, Benjamin just seems to be running out the clock. We know what will happen to him (which is extraordinary when it finally happens) but what happens in between is paced so slowly and features events that are so unexceptional that we feel like we're following his life in real time.\n\nBenjamin Button was directed by David Fincher, a brilliant talent who has made films that I have loved like Se7en, Zodiac and Panic Room and some that I didn't like Fight Club and Alien 3. What all of these films have in common is a bold visual style that's fun just to look at. He has made bad films but he has never made a boring one. What he achieves with Benjamin Button is a different visual palette for every decade of Benjamin's life and an amazing array of visual effects to transform the tall, good looking Brad Pitt into a doddery old man who is about 5 feet tall and carries him through all the stages of the man's reversed age. But all the special effects and make-up don't mean a thing if there isn't a workable story to put around them and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button contains a lackluster story within an extraordinary idea.",

            "content": "David Fincher's new film is a whole lot of hype, and it is good, albeit a big fat gimmick. As the film started, I was dazzled by the make up and the computer technology, and Brad Pitt's breathless performance. I was bored by a story that flaunts itself as being imaginative, yet is really quite plain and dry. Where was the creativity? How could a movie that is 3 hours long not have anything remotely interesting to say. The film is told 'Titanic'-style as Daisy(Cate Blanchett - God, I love her), an old decaying woman about to die, tells of her old lover, Benjamin, to her daughter. The writing just isn't that good, and the story faulters far too many times.\r\n\r\nOkay, take this for example: Benjamin(Brad Pitt) is living his life in reverse. He was born an old man and is now youthing back to childhood. It doesn't really make sense, but whatever. At one point in the film, he is - I'm guessing - in his late 50s. He has been travelling the world and meets a woman: Elizabeth Abbott. She is married, and in Benjamin's own words: \"Plain.\" But, there's something about her. She's got an electrifying sense of discovery and youth(though she's in her late 40s), she's knowledgable, and secretive. Benjamin becomes attracted to this and decides to have an affair with her. She finds herself falling in love with him, but soon leaves him, giving him a note saying, \"It was nice to have met you.\" Then, the film becomes a story about Benjamin and Daisy without making any references(except for a small one) to Elizabeth ever again. The truth is that Ben and Elizabeth's relationship is more honest and interesting than Ben and Daisy's. It would've been more creative and stretching to have Elizabeth bump into him years later to find him a young man. Would she recognize him? What if she didn't, but he reminded her of someone she can't quite put her finger on? That would've been an interesting relationship to play out.\r\n\r\nBen and Daisy's relationship is just creepy. They meet when she's young and he's old. She wants to have sex with him when he is in his late 40s, she in her early 20s. Was she just as attracted to him when he was in his late 50s? How about when he was in his 70s? She also wants to spend her life with him. They have sex a lot when they're both about at their mid-30s. Would she continue to have sex with him when he's a teenager? These questions are never brought up, ever. You'd think that if you were dating someone who youths, instead of ages, that these things would come up. Nobody seems to think that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is curious at all. People ask questions, of course, but when he explains to them that he youths rather than ages, they just brush it off as if there's nothing miraculous about it.\r\n\r\nThere are some annoying and quite stupid subplots too. A man recalling how he was struck by lightning is funny once or twice, but after the umpteenth time, it starts to get old. Also, there's a lot of talk about storms and the weather. It is so obviously trying to tell me something, but never does. By the end of the film, there's a giant hurricane in the present time at the hospital where Daisy is preparing to leave the earth. The film makes a big deal out of this hurricane and does nothing with it. Do the people all die? Does her daughter die?\r\n\r\nOkay, so far, I've just been piling on the bad. I do beleive, however, that pictures must be looked at in the grand scheme and the job of rating a film deals with how much the good outways the bad or vise versa. There are a lot of good things in this film. Tilda Swinton, Brad Pitt, and Cate Blanchett, as well as many others, give brilliant performances. It's not easy to act in a film like this. Really. It's really, very confusing. They're all up for the task, though, and I didn't even realize that Cate Blanchett plays the old, dying Daisy as well. Breathtaking, really. Also, the visual feets accomplished by the film will set a standard. When Benjamin is an 80 year old man and walks for the first time, he is about four feet tall. He is played by Brad Pitt, though. Excellent care was made in the motion capture and incorporation. The make up will probably win an Oscar, as well as the costumes. The lighting is well composed, and the visuals are generally pleasing. The good does outway the bad.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Golden Globes even nominated this film as Best Picture is a joke, and if the Academy does the same, it'll reveal their utter cluelessness. There are much better films out this year, but if you do see this film, I implore you to see it on the big screen. There is no way to appreciate this film on DVD, you must see it as a projected image, it's just that kind of movie, there is no other way to see it.",

But I loved \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\". \nThe film is about a man named Benjamin Button who leads much of an ordinary life under not so ordinary circumstances. The one thing that separates him from any other human being is that he ages backwards. Despite such large differences between the audience and Benjamin Button, the film finds a way to connect with a large variety of people in a way that does not seem to happen so often.\nThe acting was very good throughout the movie. Especially that of Cate Blanchett who seems to be turning out one great performance after another. She plays the role of Daisy, Benjamin Button's real love interest from start to finish. In fact she played so well it might have been a partial downfall to the movie. Brad Pitt is also very good, but I think he could have done-it better. Tilda Swinton was wonderful to watch as Button's short lived love interest. Her presence was magical and a joy to watch, I would have loved to see just a little bit more of her character.\nI realy enjoyed this movie very much but something felt missing from the movie. David Fincher made another movie that I loved soo much (Fight Club), the film was done very well and I would recommend it to all. Its an important story that makes us self reflect and think deeply. It displays how we need to live with our mistakes because they are part of our life. We need to appreciate what we have rather than wonder \"what if...?\".",

Brad Pitt continues to prove he's a great actor in this role, made especially difficult by the strange development of his character and how much time he spends in tons of makeup or just animated. He spends much of his life traveling by one manner or another, and meets lots of interesting and unique characters. Kate Blanchett is a girl born around the same time who, of course, ages correctly, and eventually becomes Button's love interest. The real issue with this movie is that you would think his condition would make the whole movie unique, but at times it seems to get lost, where it becomes \"oh by the way, he ages backwards\". When the movie seems to forget that, it just becomes a man's life story, and his story isn't particularly remarkable. The film is also very long, and that sort of magnifies the issue.

What else do you want me to say other than the story is well written, it was enjoyable (even though I hate using that word in movies) and brad Pitt leads the cast very well as he is my second favourite actor. Both Pitt and Cate Blanchett deserved their Oscar nominations especially Pitt but most of the films were screwed by the Academy during then. I can't believe I'm saying the word here but it's fun, that's right, it's a fun drama this movie is and provides enough sweeping elements of other genres as well.

There was also a fair amount of humor in the story that really helped drive the entertainment, and that by the time we get towards the more serious ending, we've already been swept up in this character's life.

The brilliant use of effects entertains for a nano second before you start to realise that there's something not quite right about this film. The entire (and definitely too long) 2 hours 48 minutes running time I sat there trying to figure out what was causing the sour taste left from watching this, and even now I don't quite know. There was no connection to the characters, no investment in their lives, the whole story felt somewhat disconnected. As others have said the pacing is off, and I was really starting to enjoy the end when it all of a sudden started feeling rushed as it neared the finish line.\n\nI think the cut between the dying Daisy and Benjamin's diary/flashback to the events doesn't drive the film at all and merely detracts from any connection that begins to develop between audience and character. This was a film that was built up way too much I would not recommend it and I dread to think of how many Oscar noms it is going to rack up (mind you it deserves one most definitely for special effects).",

In a somewhat rare non-comedic role for Pitt, he stars as Benjamin Button, who is \"born\" as an old man however ages backwards and becomes younger.  Blanchett looks stunning and puts in a brilliant performance throughout this movie.  The make-up artists will surely be in consideration for an Academy Award nomination.  The length of the movie (almost 3 hours) is not an issue, as I felt it was needed to tell the story.  Whilst I am sure not everyone will like this movie, I enjoyed it immensely and believe it is worth your time and money to see at the cinema.",

Even so, I found the film extremely slow paced, close to being boring, and despite the interesting beginning it got into a predictable ending very slowly. \n The idea of a person growing up backwards, or should I say growing down, is quite novel, but very un-believable and despite the exciting potential, its been messed up and the potential has not been taken advantage of. It becomes a pancake, all flat.  Unless you're a huge fan of either Brad Pitt or Cate Blanchett, dont bother. The start of the film is ok, but about one third to the movie it puts on the handbreak and slows down to a crawl. This procedure spoils the whole movie in the end. One word sums this movie up: pointlessness. One minor detail, though. The way Pitt's character reminisces his youth, reminded me in some fashion of the way Louie the vampire reminisced his early life in Interview with the Vampire. Probably just a coincidence, since this was the same actor.. \n To put it short: too slow, way too long, mushy & overly sentimental, predictable. But yes, it was curious. One might enjoy it even despite the slow pace and sentimentality, were it not for the lenght of the movie. That was its biggest problem, its slow pace and lenght. The acting is great, but the movie is not.",
