Smitten WALL-E embarks on his greatest adventure yet when he follows EVE across the galaxy.",

The first half of the movie contains solely three words along with some beeps and some whirring yet the love story between two robots still manages to be transfixing. The second half of the film boldly calls us all out as complacent, overindulgent consumerists who continue said lifestyle despite the overwhelming evidence of its harm to ourselves and the world. These thematic intricacies are often reserved for more adult films, but the way Pixar manages to take those themes and sand their edges down while still retaining their shape is truly admirable. Juggling all of those pieces with minimal dialogue and a (largely) non-human cast seems near impossible in a kid's movie, but Pixar manages to stick the landing with arguably the most complex and well executed animated film of all time.",

This movie holds up so well, the pure sentimentality and beauty of this movie make you realise that this isn't a children's movie. This is a movie written for adults but marketed as a children's movie, the complexity of the writing is something that I, as a child, could not grasp and walking out of that cinema with my parents I couldn't realise how much that movie would affect me. \n\nI am so glad that i revisited this movie and i will revisit this movie for years to come,  my true comfort movie.

It has great writing, great music, stellar animation, great romance, amazing characters, a creative idea, a great message, a powerful ending, and a great tribute to both Hello Dolly and 2001: A Space Odyssey. If I had one small problem it'd be the villain might be a bit too safe. If the villain was conflicting with his directive it would've been more interesting but the villain feels way too similar to HAL 9000 from 2001. But aside from that this film is an absolute masterpiece. I loved Soul, The Dark Knight and Luca but it's not shock that this is my all time favorite movie.",

I will say I loved this movie, it is a truly beautiful movie. It could have done with being a tad longer perhaps, but essentially this is more than a movie with A List vocal talents, WALL-E has genuine heart and will definitely enchant children and any Pixar fan. All I will say is that I am sorry it took me such a long time to see it, I will admit I was differing whether I should see it or not. But I am glad I did. The animation is simply incredible, the whole film is wonderful to look at. The whole movie is done in a very sophisticated visual style, and the bright colours and sublime backgrounds were a delight to the eyes. The music is stunning, the orchestral themes are gorgeous but the song from Hello Dolly! was great and fitted in with the story well. Speaking of the story, it may seem thin to some, but it is a very simple heart warming one all the same with depth and poignancy. There are some very imaginative moments, such as the zero-gravity dance and the ride through space. The voice cast that includes Fred Willard, Sigourney Weaver and Pixar regular John Ratzenburger did an exceptional job, and all the characters were endearing. What made the movie was WALL-E himself, he has to be one of the most lovable and in-depth Pixar characters ever, and the writers create a very haunting atmosphere in the early scenes to match our little hero's isolation. All in all, brilliant, quite possibly one of the best films of 2008. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",

Their dynamic is extremely fun, and the relationship between these two robots is romance story as it's finest.\nIt's impossible not to root for both of them, and you will definitely get attached to these characters like you were lonesome robot in a desolated world yourself.",

First off, this movie's best aspect is without a doubt the first act on earth, it's a perfect example of \"show, don't tell\" as there's not a single line of spoken dialogue, but that doesn't hamper the experience in the slightest as it instead benefits from it! Every scene between Wall-E and Eve is magnificently done and the chemistry they share is just remarkable! The amount of raw emotion shown in this half of the movie is just perfect in every way! Unfortunately, the second half isn't nearly as good as the former, but that doesn't mean it sucks. It still has a great art style, a quirky villain and some amazing performances. The second half holds up reasonably well in that regard. Secondly, with this being a Pixar movie as well, the animation is bound to be fantastic, especially the sand particles are phenomenally done, truly one of their best looking movies. Finally, this movie's score is truly magical, from the enchanting orchestral themes in space to the alluring tunes in the abandoned wasteland on earth, they're all bangers! In short, Wall-E is full of effort and a well-needed breath of fresh air with its unique story structure and charming message at its core.",

            "content": "WALL-E was the Pixar movie that from which I learnt what Pixar was. I saw its poster in the newspaper and thought it was a cool robot movie. I asked my mom to let me watch it but since we come from a very conservative family, I wasn't allowed to. We didn't have a TV at home and even when we got one, we didn't have Disney Channel paid on it. So I finally got to see it a few years ago when I was travelling in the metro. And boy this is such a good movie, I'm really disappointed I didn't see it earlier.\nWALL-E is everything we expect from a Pixar movie. It has a central character who is identified by his desire to do something big. He is living alone on a deserted planet, still cleaning up everything because that was his job. His innocence is what makes him so interesting. The movie is also moving forward with character development and world building, which makes us, the viewers, know just as much as WALL-E does. There is nothing that we don't know and a concept comes from out of the blue. The only other Pixar movie I can think of where this happens is Cars.\nThe second important character in the movie is EVE. WALL-E falls in love with her not only because she is also a humanoid robot with a feminine touch and voice, but also because she is the only other creature WALL-E has seen in this post-apocalyptic world. Other than her he has only seen rats and cockroaches, and we have seen how he treats them as a friend too. This is a metaphor of how we see the little things in life when we have nothing to either distract us or to force us to do something else. This is why WALL-E gets so much distressed when EVE puts the plant inside her and switches off, and also why he decides to follow her to space.\nIn space also WALL-E is really confused. He was never designed for space, nor had he ever seen what space looked and felt like. He had also seen the humans physically for the first time, who have deformed to a point where they are no longer recognisable. Speaking of the humans, their bones have gone detached and they are literal jellybeans at this point, who can no longer work. And they are not in a shape to continue working for very long at this rate, which can lead to their extinction. All of this happened because humans didn't care about the planet and focused more on leaving it than fixing it.\nOnce the humans finally reach Earth, they start their civilisation afresh on the abandoned planet. This is the most important message in the movie; it is never too late to redeem yourself. Many people think that the message of the movie is just to preserve the planet, but in my opinion THIS is the true message. Finally EVE and WALL-E unite and they live happily ever after, which makes it the most Pixar movie to ever exist. The animation, music, cinematography, everything is perfect. It is also suitable to people of all ages.\nThis is one of those movies which will be used to define what the animated movies of our era used to be like. It is cool, it is well made, it has a message, it has many fans and it's made by Disney. Plus it has so much emotion. If this is not the perfect Pixar movie, I don't know what is.",

I don't wanna be talking about all the good stuff, cause you all already know all the good stuff. So, let's talk about the two things that prevent my favorite from being the best of the best from this company. One, every time I rewatch this film, the environmental message seems to get more annoying, especially on my most recent watch. Like I don't care if the humans messed up awhile ago, just go back to when WALL-E and EVE were dancing in the stars, that's like my favorite scene from all of Pixar! Let me see my robot love and fight Auto. Speaking of Auto, he is truly the reason this movie isn't a 5 out of 5 for me. They could have made him so interesting, like Hal from 2001, but instead, Pixar chose to just make him follow his orders all the way through, which is a little disappointing. But that's it, everything else about this movie is basically perfect. The only reason I found these two problems is because I have seen this movie over and over again, which makes problems even more prominent. However, these problems have not stopped me from watching WALL-E 1000 times before, and they won't stop me from watching it 1000 times more. Go to Disney+ and see my favorite Pixar flick!",

The film's pro-environment message and warning on global pollution still hits home today too. While I honestly can't find any fault within the movie's own original story, Wall-E borrows a lot from existing movies like 2001: Space Odyssey, and the number of overt and blatant 'references' ripped straight from other movies really took me out of the experience at times, and definitely takes away from the movie's seriousness and originality.",

In a future world where people degraded into overweight infants who are lacking mobility and are manipulated by its android assistant, robots appear to be more human than the real humans. We might assume that love or amorous feelings is the byproducts of consciousness that set us apart from other spices without independent mind. However, the love story of Wall-E and Eve proves that even robots understand how to express the most fragile and secret feelings for their beloved one. Robots can have different personalities, skills, appearance, social classification, and most importantly, their determination and freewill to enjoy life, whether being collecting dancing video tapes, holding the hand of a partner, or\n\nIt is also interesting to see Eve as a more powerful female robot whereas Wall E, the original earth dweller is relatively inferior than her. Eve runs into his life like an innocent but strong-minded goddess. Her smooth and shiny outer shell is well-designed for high speed shuttle between space and earth. While Wall E is merely a garbage disposal prototype who leaves earth dirt along the way. The character design certainly added more obsolete elements on him to emphases the sense of outdated honesty and sincerity. Austerity represents genuine while advanced design is more about ruthless courage. Therefore, I found this film created many intriguing semiotic implications like silent films. Eve points at the earth dirt, a lighter, and a seedling to represents hope. A touch of robot fingers can also convey the human being's hazy affection within the disguise of this simple gesture. Using the simple symbiotic elements of this film, the two robots show us that love is straightforward but profound. It transcends space, race, or social status that modern people tend to care about in a relationship. Simplicity blurs the solemn questions of robot's consciousness and put the universality of love to the foreground. In the end of the world, robots possess the same loneliness, sensitivity and impulse to love others.",

This film is made in 2008 which is after directing Finding Nemo, Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film set largely in space. The special things about this film is this film had great entertainment and amazing quality. On top of that, outstanding sound and visual graphics. This movie serves as a great family movie for all ages whether big or small. Actors from the most popular Disney movies came together to create this classic yet exciting movie. I found this film is very entertaining and it should be watch by everyone.",

            "content": "Can you imagine what the earth will be in the future? Some of us will give a wonderful picture of our future lives, but the movie named Wall-E gives us a contrary description. In the movie, the earth is covered with amount of rubbish, and the only residents are a robot named Wall-E and his pet. Wall-E is a kind of robot that is produced to clear the rubbish on the earth. He works day after day, and this kind of life lasts nearly 700 years. In this period of time, Wall-E gradually has self-awareness. And one day, Wall-E's peaceful life is broken by Eve, another robot from a spacecraft of human beings, whose mission is to find plants. Wall-E falls in love with Eve at first sight. When Eve finds the plant, she is taken away by the spacecraft. Wall-E gives up his job on the earth and leaves the earth with Eve. And then they come to the spacecraft where the human beings live on. The Captain McCrea who knows that there are plants on the earth wants to go back to the earth but AUTO, the real controller of the spacecraft, refuses to implement the order from Captain McCrea. To protect the plant, Eve and Wall-E have to fight against the followers of AUTO. And during the fight, the residents on the spacecraft begin to help each other and find the true meaning of human beings. In the end, human beings return their hometown---the earth. And Wall-E realizes his dream and joins his hands with Eve.\n\nThis movie tells us a love story between robots. In real word, love is confined by a lot of things so when we find our love we will list many conditions. Contrasted with human's love, love between robots is pure and innocent. For example, when Eve become resting state, Wall-E protects her even though she doesn't know at all and when the spacecraft takes her away, Wall-E goes with her without hesitation. They cannot communicate with each other, so Wall-E cannot express his feelings to Eve by words, but though his deeds, we can and Eve also can feel the love from Wall-E. Also, the movie warns us that we must protect our\n\nearth right now. If we destroy the earth all the time, we will have to pay for our deeds.\n\nI love the movie very much even though there are not dialogues in most of the film. Compared with action, words are so pale. In our life, sometimes we say too much but do so little. We say \"love you\", but actually we love ourselves more than love others. We say \"try our best to protect the environment\", however, we still do something which is harmful to our earth. If human beings lost function of language, they would become more sincerely than now.",

The main character inside called Wall-E which were the last robot left on Earth and also Eve which also a robot sent by humans to detect how Earth has become. They have their own minds which are different from others robot, this make them become special. Although this were an animation movie for kids and family but this also an interesting adventure movie director by Andrew Stanton. After humans leave in a spaceship for many years they finally find out that Earth can live again. They are excited for it but the robot system inside the spaceship believes that humans can't live on Earth anymore. After many trouble make by the system , Wall-E and Eve become heros. They finally bring the humans back to Earth and build it up again. This really a good inspired movie to me  because the soundtrack and the acting are really detailed.",

He did. After Wall-E got well from the incident, he doesn't remember who Eve is. Eve feels very sad at that time.

On top of that it is an 2008 American computer-animated science fiction romance produced by Pixar. It stars the voices of Ben Burtt as Wall E and Elissa Knight as EVE. \n\nThe film is about humans that had abandoned Earth that was full of garbage. Where as, WALL-E, the last functional solar powered robots was left behind to clean the mess up. His daily routine is scavenging for garbage and insert into his belly then compress it into a square, neatly place into piles. After that, he was visited by a probe called EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), whom he falls in love and travels across the galaxy. They entered into a spaceship called Axiom, where human floats on personal hovercrafts, communicates with each other through phones, they are obese and they forgot how to walk. \n\nI am amazed by how this movie delivered their message without much dialogue needed. Furthermore, it was also critically praised for its animation, story, characters. visuals and relationships. There is no doubt, WALL-E was the best film of 2008.\n\nWALL-E teaches us lasting principles in our lives. First, it teaches us to not just sit around when there is a problem. But to look for solutions by our own because. Second, never leave our own mess to other people because one mens trash is another ‚Äòrobot's' treasure. Thirdly, we must cherish and love our Mother Earth before it is too late.\n\nI highly recommend it to film-goers.

Wall-E's commitment to Eve went to a point where he sacrifices and got crushed from a pod explosion. There is a part where Wall-E and Eve were dancing together and suddenly Wall-E got kissed. That totally re-surprised me. \n\nThese messages were put into this movie so that everybody can have a realization of how we should love each other more. This makes the movie easy for everybody to watch. In the end of the movie, humans got back to earth and Wall-E and Eve got together.

This movie is very simple and yet very complex, and has a really strong message too. The first half starts really slowly and quiet, everything more or less calm, until the second half comes, where it all starts to get really intense. The part where WALL-E really succeeds is in the emotional aspect. They have managed to create some very simple characters but add so much character to them, without making them speak almost at all. I applaud when a movie achieves that, and this one really knocked it out of the park. The only flaw I have found with this movie is the runtime, which is a tad too short for my taste, and it would have been nicer if, for example, WALL-E and Eve would have had more time to develop a friendship, instead of quickly rushing it. That doesn't make the movie worse, really, just slightly less credible and a bit unrealistic, but considering it's about two robots that bring the human race back to earth after everyone becomes obese and lives in a random space station, without any explanation of how and who brought them there, I don't think realism is the most important aspect of this movie.

            "content": "A sweet sci-fi feature with an unusual romance.\n\nAndrew Stanton directed Pixar's most depressing and most hopeful picture with his science-fiction romance film WALL-E (2008). Stanton's writing paints a bleak picture of humanity's future as fat, lazy fools that destroy our planet, so we must flee to the safety of space until Earth can be renourished. I appreciate his cynicism by having a megacorporation take over Earth, fund a private spaceship, and brainwash humanity for centuries into a relaxed state of apathy only to be ironically foiled by a robot they programmed whose curiosity and kindness lead him to a fancy robotic girlfriend of his own. It's an adorable love story told during an apocalypse that's all too endearing.\n\nStanton's direction is striking with a visionary way of portraying a little garbage compactor robot's feelings through expressive visual storytelling. You learn everything in WALL-E by virtue of clever facial cues and visual clues thanks to Jeremy Lasky, Martin Rosenberg, and Danielle Feinberg's cinematography. Their use of far wide shots to demonstrate how isolated and lonely WALL-E is on Earth is quite clever. The tender close-ups of WALL-E and EVE are adorable and memorable as they gaze into each other's optical nerves.\n\nStephen Schaffer's editing cuts WALL-E's story down to only the necessary scenes to understand what is happening and why without any filler for a cool 98 minutes. Pixar's 3D animation and computer graphics have never looked more real on this quaint robot in his garbage world of endless trash. Thomas Newman's understated score works wonders on building atmosphere with ambient classical music. His use of Hello Dolly's musical numbers is very cute too.\n\nBen Burtt's voice is magnificent as the innocent, curious compactor droid WALL-E. His cute expressions and line delivery are already iconic. The way he stretches out syllables with WALL-E's robotic vocal tone is too much fun and very memorable. Elissa Knight's voice is so playful and concerned as EVE. She's a great love interest for WALL-E.\n\nJeff Garlin is funny as the ignorant Captain, while Fred Willard is hilarious as the inept President and BnL CEO Shelby Forthright. John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy cameo as John and Mary. Can you believe Signourney Weaver cameos as the voice of the ship's computer? All in all, WALL-E's voice cast uses their vocal gifts superbly in a very expressive manner.\n\nWALL-E remains one of Pixar's finest films with a clear message and heartfelt storytelling.",

Andrew Stanton shows once again that he is one of the best directors in the Pixar family, yet again making another instant CLASSIC! He incorporated so many magnificent shots, utilizing the perfect balance of slow, wide, and close up shots.\n\nThe story was well told, being an innocent, yet complex rom-com, while having some great sentimental notes. Don't be fooled, even though this is technically a children's movie, there is so much adult entertainment, that the whole family will do nothing but fall in love with this film! The first act is one of the most enjoyable first acts Pixar has offered yet. Stanton & Docter started off building this grimmy world, set about 700 years from now, incorporating these two polar opposite, but super charming and enjoyable robots in Wall‚Ä¢E & EVE. Their chemistry and charm is what drove this film! With the first half started off with a bang, come the second half, it gets taken to a whole other level! This is where Wall‚Ä¢E & EVE get their defining moments, with greatly placed action.\n\nWall‚Ä¢E, voiced by Ben Burtt was one of Pixar's most lovable protagonist, though having this rusty, ruggid look, and not having much to say. His humanized traits, curiosity, and pure charm is what made his character so lovable. EVE, voiced by Elissa Knight, was a very intelligent robot solider, that turns out to have great character development. She basically steals the main protagonist label from Wall‚Ä¢E, though sharing the wealth very generously. Stanton & Docter somewhat refrained from giving us true back stories to our main characters, but in return, they gave us good information to be able to infer where they comes from.\n\nThe screenplay didn't have much importance in the first thirty-five minutes or so, but come the second, and mainly the third act, Pete Docter & Andrew Stanton put together a well thought-out, passionate script, incorporating a lot of heart.\n\nThe cinematography and animation was absolutely GORGEOUS! The back drops were so deatiled and vibrant, really mashing well with the vibrant colors, and color contrast. The animations were stunning as always, with realistic detail in the metals, dirt, rocks, and everything in between.\n\nThe score by the very popular Thomas Newman, was very dramatic, and created this great connection between the audience and the characters. The music was a pretty good touch, really coming alive in the third act.",

The animation for space and Earth is visually gorgeous and looks so real and really makes you feel like you're in the 29th century. For me, this is Pixar's most visually stunning movie. The first 35 minutes of this movie as well is magical with no dialogue, going through Wall-E's daily routine and establishing his relationship with EVE and as I said, it's no dialogue. It's 35 minutes of beautiful visuals, a stunning score and clear character expressions and we understand everything that happens. The second half is just as amazing with stunning visuals, develops EVE and Wall-E's relationship so well that it feels really satisfying when they are together and the human aspect is just as interesting, showing the effects of the future on humans and them trying to get back to Earth is an exciting journey and a really powerful message as this will likely happen to us in 80 years and the movie doesn't hold back showing us the consequences. All I can say is this movie is amazing and should have gotten a Best Picture Nomination. (A+)",

This is a film that has both and you will be richly rewarded for investing in it's deceptively simple concept as this is a film that touches on themes of first love as well as tackling the modern consumerist culture and the impact that this could have on the environment. Here is a picture that has real substance but that is also extremely fun for it's audience of children and for adults. A wide audience can take in the film with all of it's messaging and deep themes because it is so sweet and yet at the same time never becomes saccharine and painful to get through.\n\nThe hook at the center of the film is the unexpected romance between two robots as WALL-E and EVE have a touchingly na√Øve connection that makes us care for them as we do for humans. Perhaps it is his aching loneliness as he moves through a vast wasteland that makes the fact that they find one another so wonderful. Then there is his dogged pursuit of her as he tries his hardest to endear himself to her and only those with the hardest of hearts will be turned off by his loving efforts to charm her. This is clearly what raises the film above the cynical cash grabs that most animated features are nowadays with The Secret Life of Pets 2 (2019) lacking an ounce of the heartfelt spirit that this film generates.\n\nThe dark vision that the film provides of the future offsets this sweetness nicely as the film shows humankind becoming morbidly obese and disinterested in the destroyed environment around them. As a child I was shocked by this depiction of people as I was used to seeing apple cheeked, friendly young boys playing with toys or evil, authoritarian older women but not benevolent yet useful humans. This is a film that will encourage children to take part in trying to save our planet so that we can avoid ending up like the characters presented in the film.",

I mean, movies about this kind of thing had never ever been good, but this one, went to the infinite eternity of space when it took off. The reason I say this is because, most people won't even flinch when watching this, but they won't think kids will even Watch the movie because of the storyline, which is just amazing! There's no words for it. But, some parents would actually question the story for it's commercialism, environmentalism, etc. But, I am only 10 3/4, and I've loved this movie ever since I was only 5! And, I understood it very well, and I actually turned to enjoy it from then on. So, I think it's safe to say that, you shouldn't hold back on seeing new movies, even if the storyline doesn't interest you, you might still turn out to love it. Even though the first half hour barely has any dialogue, and we only rely on facial expressions, it actually feels like Eve and Wall-E have a connection with each other through out the movie, and the ending is one of the best I have ever seen, when the Axiom finally after 700 years returns to earth, and Eve and Wall-E finally found what they were looking for, along with the funny animations during the end credits, you've got yourself one heck of a heartfelt movie and ending.",

            "content": "WALL-E- Life Lessons and Deeper Meanings\n\n\tPixar is the holy grail of children's film studios. With instant classics such as Finding Nemo, Up, and the perfect trifecta that is the Toy Story films, Pixar knows how to use storyline, music and aesthetically pleasing visuals to relentlessly tug on heartstrings, teach important lessons and leave lasting impressions on children and grown up's alike. WALL-E is no exception. \nThe film opens in the future- a deeply unsettling and eerily predictable future for Earth. Trash and debris is piled high into the thick, brown, unbreathable, polluted atmosphere and it's here that we are introduced to our star and perhaps the \"Adam\" of this new world, WALL-E. WALL-E stands for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth- Class. WALL-E is small and unsturdy, dirty and an extremely diligent overachiever. He spends the long hours of the day collecting trash and compacting it into cubes which he stacks one on top of the other to create endless skyscrapers of waste. Heartbreakingly, WALL-E is the last working robot on Earth and whenever he comes across an unfortunate decommissioned friend, he swaps out his old parts, such as his shredded foot treads, for theirs. After the sun goes down, WALL-E heads back to his little shack, unpacks the many treasures that he's found that day, and settles in to watch an old classic, Hello Dolly with his only companion- a seemingly indestructible cockroach. And so it goes, day after day, for hundreds of years. There is almost no dialogue in the first twenty minutes of the film and yet, it is poignant and meaningful. \nThe humans of this film exist aboard the Axiom and for the last few hundred years have lost all form of true human connection. They are obese and lazy, relying completely on machines to do simple everyday tasks. They coexist in the thousands but only speak to each other with the use of a screen. Back on Earth, our lonely WALL-E meets his long lost love, EVE, quite literally delivered to him from the heavens. She is there to search for vegetation, or any sign that Earth might be making a comeback. Although EVE is originally threatened by WALL-E, there is an almost instant connection between the two. WALL-E is instantly enthralled by EVE and presents her with his latest treasure, a small but beautiful little plant which he had so carefully planted in a dirty old shoe. Having fulfilled her duty, EVE instantly shuts down and waits for the spacecraft to collect her and the specimen. We watch intently as WALL-E so lovingly cares for EVE while she silently waits for retrieval and when the spaceship returns, WALL-E cannot bare to see his soulmate leave him and barely manages to catch a ride out of the grimy atmosphere of Earth and into space. Throughout the rest of the film, we watch as WALL-E tracks down EVE and together they realize the evil plan of the Axiom, awaken the need for physical, face to face connection, and ultimately save the world. \nThere's two major thematic lessons to be learned from this film. First, if we do not stop being such irresponsible and wasteful consumers, our Earth might end up resembling something of the prison that WALL-E belonged to at the beginning of the film. It is hard not to draw connection between the large superstore's \"Buy N Large\" that dot the planet in this plotline and the consumerism that exists today. WalMart and Amazon are the new global superpowers that we are all lowly subjects to. If we want it now, we get it now- or at least shipped to our doorstep overnight. This film, although meant for children, vividly paints an unfortunate picture of what could be.  Second, our rapidly expanding use of technology is already undermining real human connection and if left unchecked, could dramatically alter the quality of our relationships. WALL-E and EVE are only machine, yet they capture such a raw and powerful, sometimes even awkward, relationship. One such scene is portrayed when WALL-E is almost shot back to Earth and EVE goes to save him, resulting in a cinematically beautiful sequence in which they both jet across the star filled sky together, WALL-E using a fire extinguisher to propel himself alongside EVE.  There is such a stark contrast between WALL-E and EVE and the people who live in their motorized chairs with screens in their faces. The first human connection we see doesn't occur until a screen is bumped out of the hands of Mary, a citizen of the Axiom. It's then that she notices, perhaps for the first time, the immense galaxies that surround their spacecraft home. Instantly, she taps the shoulder of her nearest neighbor, John, to share in that spectacular moment. From then on, Mary and John spend actual time together, splashing each other in a pool, laughing and having real conversation. It seems that FaceTime and social media, or machines that are made to do everything for us, will never replace or fulfill what face to face physical connection provides us. \nIt is interesting and important to further note the distinct relation between WALL-E and EVE to the age old tale of Adam and Eve. The first people in a new world who started the Fall, thereby creating life that ultimately started humanity. It says a lot for where we are as a society, it begs to ask an important question, a question that asks if we are also due for a reset, it forces us to ask what changes need to occur before we irrevocably destroy our Earth and our own emotional and physical connections. In this story, it was a machine Adam (WALL-E) and Eve, who awakened that new world, yet one of the key lessons from this film shows us the dangers of our own personal machines taking away our freedom and true connection. As with all of the greatest movies, this Pixar film will make you think deeper than you might've thought before. This film is so multi- faceted and will have your head spinning by the end. \nWALL-E will make you smile, laugh, and might even make you shed a few tears (this is Pixar, afterall). On the surface, it's an age old tale of a small and insignificant boy falling for a smart and sophisticated girl. Younger audiences might only pick up on WALL-E and EVE's shenanigans and the hilarious band of misfit, dysfunctioning machines as they fight off the brains of the Axiom, an evil dictator robot. However, Pixar takes us back to the first fundamental story humanity. Pixar sounds the alarm with this film and if you look a little deeper and watch a little more closely, it is less of a simple love story and more of an unmistakable warning, all wrapped up in the art and imagery that Pixar so easily invokes. \nWorks Cited\nBulayo, Ashley, et al. \"Wall-E: 10 Years Later.\" The Young Folks, 27 June 2018, www.theyoungfolks.com/film/122375/wall-e-10-years-later-and-even-more-relevant/.\n\"WALL-E .(2008)\" Rotten Tomatoes, www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wall_e.",

For most of the first half of the movie, there's barely any talking. And yet, WALL-E's love for EVE is evident from the start and you feel for everything that happens. I was more invested in their relationship than ones in most other films that get hours and lots of dialogue to showcase their chemistry. It's a testament to the story told and the work the filmmakers did that this romance works so well. The fact that this flawed protagonist goes to great lengths for his love takes him on a magnificent adventure. The bigger story about the human race having spent 700 years in space and having to get back down to Earth was well done. It tied in to WALL-E's story with ease and allowed his act to have a greater meaning. There's also a fair bit of humor included in this cute tale. As always, Pixar's animation style is among the best in the world.\n\nWeaknesses: The lack of dialogue can make this a tough watch for some. I've heard plenty of people who couldn't get into the movie because of this. It can come across as boring if you aren't willing to put the time in for the story to reward you.   \n\nOverall: A beautifully crafted story told in a way that really makes you feel. The animation is top notch, the characters are easy to invest in, it's sweet, and tells a brilliant love story. The genius of it all is honestly underrated. A classic.",

Amidst evidence of the very worst of human nature, we're also reminded of its most redeeming qualities, and experience many of them through fresh eyes. Wall-E takes the time to appreciate things that our obsessively screen-gazing descendants miss (an uncomfortably prescient prediction, that) and, as we're along for the ride with him this time, we do, too.

Its social commentary is so surface level that I thought it was obnoxious even at the age of 9. And worst of all it looks ugly. This is easily the most visually offensive thing Pixar has produced, with their worst character designs, their worst backgrounds, and the most static, uninteresting movements of their filmography.

The fact that the movie has little to no dialogue for the first 30 minutes and slowly builds as it goes on works, it really really works! There is only one way to describe the connection between Wall-E and Eve, ADORABLE! Every time you see them next to each other, you want them to be together because Pixar just knows how to make their love for each other so powerful. Another thing the movie does so well is how it makes robots bond with humans, but seeing as how in their previous movie Ratatouille, they did something like this but with rats and humans, it makes sense to do this but with robots instead of rats. Major difference though is that throughout Ratatouille, humans despise rats until the end, which is not the case in Wall-E. This movie does so much right that it gets a 9.5 out of 10 from me! It shows how not every movie needs to be dialogue heavy to be amazing.They truly made Wall-E' s adventure an unforgettable one. Definitely a part of my top 10 Pixar movies. And one more thing, this was directed by Andrew Stanton, the same guy behind my favorite Pixar movie of all time, Finding Nemo! Hell yeah!",

Whoever was left behind didn't make it, so all of humankind is in this space ark.\n\nWall-e is a dutiful little robot running on a rechargeable solar powered battery. It is his duty to sort and stack junk. While humanity is away surviving on their ark, Wall-e has been doing his job for hundreds of years. He is a cleaner of the Earth, building large rectangular piles of compressed scrap metal. Wall-e is given a personality and the human like trait of craving some companionship after a long day of work, so he is a collector of interesting and useful items, including many spare parts which he uses to fix himself as needed. Wall-e's one friend is a lone insect, a seemingly indestructable bug.\n\nA female seeming robot named Eva is sent to Earth to do a routine scan for life. She finds a plant growing in an old boot and fulfills her mission to bring it back. This is very exciting news for humanity! They can stop living on the ark and go home and replant and rebuild the Earth. One little problem: the artificially intelligent ark auto-pilot does NOT want to give up its role as benevolent caretaker and unofficial ruler of humans. Wall-e and Eva and the human Captain together battle the auto-pilot to put the ship back into human control.",

            "content": "There are two ways to view the future through sci-fi lenses: the mechanical wow-ness of a space world, or a dusty, human-less Earth. In Wall-E, another Pixar hit, the Earth is dusty and human-less, except that humans currently live in space and Earth is covered in garbage. The humans, after evacuating in a luxurious spaceship, christened the Axiom, leave behind tiny clean-up machines, Wall-Es (Waste Allocation Load Lifter - Earth-Class), to collect, compress and stack the garbage into skyscrapers. One big problem is that most of the Wall-Es have rusted and broken, but the bigger problem is that no human, who now live on hoverchairs and are made up of just fat and (almost) no bones, remembers them. But they are not entirely forgotten. \n\nAfter a long day at work for Wall-E, the humans send a reconnaissance robot named EVE to find evidence that there is life on Earth. After completing her \"directive,\" she is retrieved by the Axiom and a heartbroken and devastated Wall-E follows her onto the ship. This vital evidence, a tiny plant found in a worn-out shoe, determines the future of the lazy, fat humans.\n\nOscar-winning director and writer Andrew Stanton gloriously adds another star to Pixar almost as valuable Toy Story. With dazzling colors and top-notch animation, Wall-E's intensity is far from severe but still demonstrates the teamwork and devotion of the captain, humans, Wall-E and EVE as they battle the mutinous autopilot of the Axiom. At times when it seems hopeless for Wall-E and EVE, Pixar shows us how friends stick up for each other, not just in sunny days, but also in rainy days.",

            "content": "WALL-E takes place on Earth in the far off future.  Humans are nowhere to be seen, and the Earth is covered in endless mounds of garbage.  WALL-E is a tiny little robot dude whose job is to compact garbage and stack it (I might be a bit hazy on the details here, it's been a couple years since I saw it).  Once upon a time there were other robots helping out, but eventually the plan was scrapped, and WALL-E somehow survived, and became... sentient I guess, sort of.  The beginning of the film is a bit like Castaway, in that it's just one character going about his routine for a while, with only a little cockroach dude as his friend.  He does his duty, and goes to his shipping container house, where he has an assortment of random nick nacks he finds lying about.  \n\nOne day, while working his gig, WALL-E stumbles across a little plant growing in the dirt.  He collects the specimen and plants it in a boot or something.  Sometime later, a more futuristic floating robot comes along named EVE.  Her job is to locate plant life on Earth because as it turns out, Humans live in orbit in a giant space station.  Years of zero gravity, and general human stupidity have caused them to become incredibly overweight, and lazy.  WALL-E meets EVE and desperately wants her to be his friend, and begins to fall in love, even though the characters express themselves through physical interaction and various iterations of their only word of dialogue \"WALL-E\" for WALL-E, and \"EVE\" for EVE.  At one point he gives her the plant as a gift, which ends up fulfilling her mission objective and making it so that she gets picked up to be sent back to the space station.  WALL-E tags along for the adventure... of a liftime, or whatever.\n\nFrom this point on there's a storyline of conspiracy, love and saving the planet that unravels, but I'll let you watch that part if you're still interested.  Since you're unfamiliar with Pixar, the films feature glossy, brightly colored computer animation, where humans have facial characteristics similar to Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story.  It's essentially what Disney has transformed into, so if you like Disney movies, this is kind of like their evolutionary byproduct.  There's a lot less singing than your standard Disney fare, but elements of the studio are certainly present.  \n\nTL;DR - 3/10\nIt's the animated story of a Robot who cleans the earth, falls in love, and tries to save the planet.  I thought there were a bunch of problems with the film, and was unable to suspend my disbelief, finding the entire narrative coming across as extremely condescending to the viewer' and pandering to their sensibilities.  That said, the film has nearly unanimous critical acclaim, and unless you're cynical like I am, you will probably enjoy the film, I guess.  I stick with my opinion that the film is a 3/10, but judging by my review offending almost everyone that came across it, you'll probably find the general consensus among people is 9/10.  Give the trailer a view, and if you like the animation style/aesthetic, you're already way more into it than I was.",

In some movies like Cars 2 and A Bug's Life, the slow transitioning eventually bores you. Every scene in this movie is so important. After watching Wall-E, the message of the film stuck with me.

In a way, it is kind of explaining humanity through a more digital view. For example, the ending scene is easily recognized as a love cliche, that love brought Wall-e back. However, the film interpreted much more concisely. When Eve electric-kissed Wall-e the 1st time, she somehow made a digital copy of him into her memory database. When Wall-e was repaired, his memory board was replaced and so he reverted back to a blank robot. The 2nd electric-kiss copied Eve's backup of Wall-e back into him.\n\nThat is a very clear and digital explanation of love. Love is basically keeping a copy of the object of your affection in your heart. And when that person forget who they are (often through emotional tragedy or illness), many believe love will bring them back b/c in a way, we try to help them remember who they were since we remember them in our hearts.\n\nFantastic Film.",

That's because the entire premise for the story and every inch of the beautifully-realised world building is so geared towards this, and the result is something very sobering indeed, and actually extremelly delicate and slow. That's not saying it's all gone cold though, because the emotional significance of what Wall-E has to offer is on par with the studio's best, and the robot characters are as interesting and human as you could hope (intentionally more so, in fact, than the humans that occupy this story alongside). The result of that is a film that engages and touches your emotions, and consequently has you hooked in the desolate vision of its future dystopian world more than many un-animated offerings.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: It wont slap that big Pixar smile on your face in the way you might have been expecting, and its slower pace does occasionally annoy too.\nVERDICT: 'Wall E' is a very different kind of Pixar movie, and whilst that may sadden some fans, for me it's one of their best.",

            "content": "When it comes to the greatest Pixar movies, most people agree that WALL-E is definitely one of the best, and many of them say that it is the best. And even some say that it's one of the greatest films ever made period. It's actually kind of insane how much praise it's getting.\n\nSo, is it bad to say that I think it's a bit overrated? I'm sorry, but this is not among my favorite Pixar films, or even one of my favorite animated films. But, that does not mean that I dislike this film, or that I can't see why people love it so much. For me, the best parts in the film are in the first half. The film is set several centuries later and shows our home planet all polluted, so you could tell right away that this movie is a cautionary tale about the environment. But throughout the first half, they do it in a way that's very subtle. They didn't add any dialogue to help convey the message, it's all done through visuals, which is really all you need.\n\nAnd the visuals look incredible, the animation looks very photo-realistic. I'd swear they just filmed it at a certain area and added in a CG robot (WALL-E) and follow along his journey around the abandoned Earth. To this day, I think this the best looking Pixar film we've had yet. The whole first act is a chance for the audience to just get sucked into the film's atmosphere, be a part of an experience, not have to listen to any dialogue, and just enjoy the relationship between WALL-E and EVE (or EVA), which by the way is adorable.\n\nI just wish that the rest of the film was like that. I know that some may find it boring if they would've stayed on Earth, but you never know. Pixar is known for taking risks, and it probably would've been more interesting if they were to stay on Earth, just focus on the two robots, and have mankind be this great mystery of where they moved on. Make the film less of a movie and more of an experience. Instead, we get to see what mankind is up to and show that they still have hopes of returning to their home planet and repopulating it. That concept is okay, but it easily could've been a lot stronger because of what we've seen in the first half. In the second half, the message is not as meaningful as it was in the first half. It was much more powerful when they showed us what are world would be like rather than tell us over and over that maybe we should return home and actually do something about it. By then, the message becomes too preachy. \n\nAnd we've heard of this message so many times already. We get it, our world is in danger, mankind is polluting the planet, and it might eventually become uninhabitable unless we do something. I know, I'm probably being too harsh on this. Of course, I care about our home planet. It's just with this film, they keep hammering in that message that I become disinterested. I guess it's just not my cup of tea.\n\nI know you're probably thinking that I don't like this film because of the preachy environmental message, I don't think that way at all. I don't love the film, but I still really like it. It's just that it started off so well when presenting the message in a subtle way only by visuals and atmosphere that it doesn't come off nearly as powerful when they verbally tell you the message. Sometimes, it's better to show and not tell. But the stuff I love in the first half, with the incredible visuals and the relationship between WALL-E and EVE, I really love. Even though I have my own personal problems with the film, don't let me stop you from loving it.\n\nGrade: B+",

            "content": "*GREAT MOVIE*\n\nThere are certain things people have come to expect from Disney Pixar films at this point. The main expectation is that the film will be lovable and entertaining to people of all ages. Their previous films, \"Toy Stories 1 & 2\", \"A Bug's Life\", \"Monster's Inc.\", \"Finding Nemo\", \"Ratatouille\" and even later films like \"Up\" and \"Toy Story 3\" have all succeeded. They're all adorable, memorable, and undeniably clever. The 2008 film \"WALLƒÇ∆íƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢?ƒÇ∆í,ƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢E\" is another Pixar production that manages to be fantastic for people of all ages. However, I feel \"WALLƒÇ∆íƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢?ƒÇ∆í,ƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢E\" has reached an entirely different level of filmmaking.\n\n\"WALLƒÇ∆íƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢?ƒÇ∆í,ƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢E\" is a special movie for so many reasons. Obviously it's going to be compared to Pixar's previous films, and for many reasons, it should be. But I hope people will understand, after time perhaps, the true power and brilliance of the film. It's received much praise from critics, Pixar lovers, and just average movie goers, but I don't feel it has made a spot as the superior Pixar film. My goal in this review is to convince you of its brilliance and wonder, and hopefully you too will reconsider, if you have not yet already.\n\nLike I said earlier, \"WALLƒÇ∆íƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢?ƒÇ∆í,ƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢E\" was a very well liked film by critics and fans, and received an Oscar for best Animated Feature, as well as some other nominations. I still feel it has been underrated and perhaps not appreciated to its full extent. \n\nThe adorable robot WALLƒÇ∆íƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢?ƒÇ∆í,ƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢E is about as lovable as any Pixar protagonist should be. He's curious, and fascinating to watch. The short moments that take place on Earth in the beginning of the film are some of the most delightful. Along with being cute for the children, the film reveals many extremely important aspects of the story. These machines were left behind on Earth to clean up, while all the remaining humans took off in spaceships. It appears that our protagonist is the only one left still working. He's lonely, but keeps his spirits up by showing interest in many man-made objects that he tries to understand. \n\nHis most challenging comprehension: love. It may seem stupid or ridiculous, but remember that this is a kids movie. And even if it wasn't a kids movie, it's not stupid and it's not ridiculous, under the circumstances of the film. WALLƒÇ∆íƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢?ƒÇ∆í,ƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢E watches \"Hello Dolly\" on an IPod, and is showing interest in a particular scene in which two characters embrace. The feeling of loneliness in this poor little robot is perfectly portrayed after a scene of emptiness and curiosity out in the wastes of the Earth that remain. WALLƒÇ∆íƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢?ƒÇ∆í,ƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢E's loneliness goes perfectly with his surroundings. \n\n\nMost of the film takes place on a spaceship, and I have to explain why this occurs, and I'm sorry for explaining key areas of the plot. However, since this is a great movie, as usual, I feel it is necessary. WALLƒÇ∆íƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢?ƒÇ∆í,ƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢E, the adorable robot longing for a partner, happens upon a spacecraft that has just landed in the wastes. Out comes a beautiful, somewhat frightening, female robot capable of firing lasers and hovering. After some distant admiration, WALLƒÇ∆íƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢?ƒÇ∆í,ƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢E and EVE join as a curious pair. \n\nSome more information, but mainly an analysis of a brilliant scene: Earlier in the movie, WALLƒÇ∆íƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢?ƒÇ∆í,ƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢E stumbled upon something odd. He opened a fridge to find a beautiful, growing, green object: A plant. \n\nLove is powerful, even robot love, but EVE's mission is what she is programmed to do. After WALLƒÇ∆íƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢?ƒÇ∆í,ƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢E shows her the plant, she is shut down until she's picked up by the small ship, just to return to the mothership (The Axiom) out in the vast emptiness of space. While this incredibly thought-provoking and interesting science fiction story is happening, it's being charged by the power of WALLƒÇ∆íƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢?ƒÇ∆í,ƒÇ‚Äö√Ç¬¢E's love for EVE. He desperately tries to wake her after she is shut down, and he follows her to the Axiom.\n\nI'm still amazed whenever thinking about this movie, how well it stands as a children's movie and a science fiction film. On the Axiom, all humans are overweight and have been overpowered by technology. Indeed, the film is also prophetic. The story from here on out is too wonderful to describe, and all throughout, it remains adorable and funny, just how Pixar tends to be. \n\nSo my general opinion of this wonderful robot love story is that it should be understood in a few ways: 1. It's a very energetic, entertaining and lovable children's film about a beautiful robot relationship. And 2. It's a fascinating science fiction idea, prophetic and smart.",

Creating all the visuals in a film using only computers is one thing, but relying on those visuals to convey all emotions in a movie with virtually no dialogue is truly remarkable. They raise the bar even higher by making all those emotions come from robots who are naturally cold and inexpressive. WALL-E was actually one of the rare Pixar movies I did not see in a theater, because the concept seemed ridiculous, and now I regret that. It is astounding how great they did at making a truly deep and entertaining film with those tremendous limitations. It kind of hearkens back to the old days of silent film. There is some superb physical comedy, and most of the plot is simple to follow despite virtually no exposition. I love the characters the animators created including a great variety of robots on board the Axiom, each one has its own job and personality that shines through tremendously. If you don't know the plot, it is a distant future where humanity trashed planet Earth, and therefore decided to abandon it and live on a spaceship. When they fled, humanity left some trash compacting robots to try and clean up the mess. WALL-E is one of those robots, and he's been going about his business but everything changes when he finds that a plant has begun to grow again.\n\nThe plot goes into some really prescient topics as it depicts humanity as a race that has foregone physical interaction and has become almost completely detached from reality. The entire plot could feel preachy, but in a way its kind of inspiring. I love how a machine is the one who first recognizes the beauty of real life and love, and he becomes the catalyst that opens the eyes of so many others. It's very counter-intuitive, and therefore has some added impact. While I love and greatly appreciate his work on Star Wars this is truly Ben Burtt's magnum opus. In every single shot of this film he added something amazing to the audio. The \"voices\" of the different robots have so much character, and each one has its own unique sound. He carried the load almost as much as the animators when it came to the task of making these robots into characters. Hello Dolly was an interesting choice as a film that shaped WALL-E's personality, but I do like the songs so it seems to work. If I complained about anything it would just be that the humans from the past are played live-action which feels odd contrasted against the big animated baby-people in the future. It's really a minor gripe in what is otherwise a magnificent film. Now that I've seen it a couple times I'm starting to think this could be one of my favorites from Pixar, it tells a magnificent story in a great way.",

It is just such a sweet tale with robots who seem so human like it is just amazing and lovely in equal measure. This film really goes to show that Pixar is at the top of it's game still and really to be fair in the world of animation, they are still reigning supreme. I thought this was just about amazing and here below is just why so.\n\nThe movie is just the right length and so well timed as well with it's jokes but also it's more sweeter moments which blend together so well. The movie is pleasant all the way through, sure some things happen along the way but even in the more less happy moments, you still can't help feel a smile coming on watching little old WALL-E the robot trundle along, and on the case of WALL-E he is perfect as our main character, created with just the right amount of cuteness. \n\nIt has such a beautiful score accompanying it too with Thomas Newman making scenes even more brilliant with his delicate touch in music. Peter Gabriel's song \"Down to Earth\" is amazing as well and when it is played in the final credits you will just feel so warm about this movie. The animation style is also a massive highlight here too, it is so detailed and yet keeps that signature Pixar style to a tee, just wonderful stuff and all credit goes to the staff for doing such a good job.\n\nOne thing that really stood out for me is that the robots hardly communicate with voice, you can understand everything that is going on perfectly well with just the noises and actions of these really sweet little bots. I loved the style in which they talk too and the way Ben Burtt makes WALL-E's various sounds is just glorious with every little action and noise being completely flawless and yet again, so sweet.\n\nNow there is no doubt this is aimed at kids of course it is, but it brings up very important points about the earth and how we treat it, and ourselves. The way in which now humans can't live on earth because of so much toxicity is weirdly disturbing to watch and raises absolutely massive environmental questions even if it just an animated movie. It also brings up the old robots of the future question, now of course some robots in this aren't the best of robots but this is one of the first films where future robots are portrayed as sweet and actually have feelings.\n\nNow this is just fun all the way through and I couldn't recommend this more to anyone, whether kid or adult this is sure to make you happy and even the most grumpy of people could be swayed by this. It is also a good old laugh too, now I have seen funnier animations but this is still pretty funny so again all credit to the team and if you want a laugh too then this is it also.\n\nOverall it is sublime animating and must be one of the best animations of all time(I know for some it could be of all time!). I can see just why critics and cinema goers alike loved this and going into it I expected a lot but got even more than I expected afterwards.",

The story was a bit hard to understand completely (especially since there wasn√¢??t much words or sentences spoken in the beginning), but it made more sense after repetitive watching. Wall-E and Eve (or just about any robot for that matter) may not be much on words, but they√¢??re both quite lovable enough for characters.

Oh, it's not that I hate their films, it's just that they don't seem to hit my heartstrings the way they do for most people.  Monsters Inc and The Incredibles both left me cold, and even Toy Story, though impressive as hell when it came out, viewing from a perspective of having seen many well animated movies, just doesn't really interest me.  But this movie?  This is a *great* movie.  Perhaps it's partly because I grew up watching movies like Short Circuit and Batteries Not Included, but I found Wall-E completely charming.  In fact it managed to charm me so completely that I even ran out and got Hello Dolly - which I also loved.  Now I can't watch one without watching the other!",

            "content": "I would categorize Wall-e as on slightly lower than, or even on par with, Toy Story as a game-changing film.  Perhaps the most inventive and original portrayal of a standard bildungsroman plot, Wall-e proves that you don't need dialogue to make people care about characters.  Their mannerisms and responses to the world around them make them either endearing or villainous all on their own, and Pixar/Disney was smart enough to not try to write in anything more than a sentence or two exchanged between the characters.  The absence of extensive dialogue also meant there was appropriate room for the score to come into play where it would otherwise not be needed could the characters monologue.  Music is designed to convey emotion, and where it is often overdone and put into scenes that don't require handholding, Wall-e had a beautifully simple score that mirrored the story's events almost seamlessly.  I also enjoy Pixar/Disney's use of the same voice actors from film to film; it gives the movie a slight nostalgic nod to the older Disney films, where the same actors were reused over and over.  It gives the film a sense of familiarity, especially since the rest of the actors are robots in space.  Overall, Wall-e deserved far more credit and hype than it received, and is a beautifully woven mix of 2001: Space Odyssey and Beauty and the Beast with robots that will win your heart.",

From here, he embarks on an adventure that shows us what it truly means to care for another while delivering a strong ECO-friendly message to the masses. For a film that can not only make you fall in love with a robot that solemnly speaks (but makes many other robotic noises), fear for the life of a funny little cockroach, and can also teach you something important about our own future, Wall-E is truly a marvel of animated wizardry.

As usual with Pixar stuff animation quality here is top noch, it doesn't reach the hyper-realistic and immersiveness heights of Avatar but this comparison is probably not fair because I'm comparing films with different cinematographic principles. Despite not providing the sheer sensorial immersiveness that Avatar provides and as consequence submitting itself more openly to intellectual scrutiny, Wall-E leaves nothing to be desired and manages to have as much emotional impact in me as Avatar which makes it all the more brilliant. I've seen it 2 times and I want to see it again. It deserves to be considered a classic of animation cinema!",

However, it's the first word that comes to mind when describing WALL-E's breathtaking animation. Pixar utilizes its animation prowess to great extent, especially with the colours. The contrasting environments of the Axiom and planet Earth go to show the varying extremes of life in the future. WALL-E uses the characters and its surroundings to highlight many issues of modern day society and the path we're headed down.\n \nPixar manages to convey large amounts of emotion with WALL-E, no part in thanks to its romance in slow-burn. Never before has a company managed to make viewers feel so much for machines. WALL-E takes some risks that make it an atypical animated film, the largest one of all being the limited amount of lines, with the film going for dozens of minutes without anything being said. Instead, Pixar uses facial expressions (yes, of robots) in addition to the few lines that are said, to convey emotion.  \n\nWALL-E couples a well-written story and gorgeous animation with a well-thoughtout score to reaffirm its meaning. It also utilizes parallelism, contrast, and reoccurring themes to support its main elements. All of this wraps up well, with WALL-E striking a balance in setting, time, and audience. \n\nPixar, once again, shows us how to truly make animated films. WALL-E conveys strong messages to viewers but doesn't fail to keep the family entertained.",

Centered around a wonderful little garbage robot - designation, Wall-E. Stuck on Earth to clean up the mess long after the human race has left the planet they destroyed.\n\nThere is so much to enjoy here, but what I especially appreciated was the thought and design detail that went into creating this world, and the robot characters at the center of this story. From the barren waste land on Earth, to the bright colors of the Axiom space liner. Every element of this film seems carefully crafted, and lovingly presented. Wall-E's utilitarian function, versus Eve's slick design. It's all beautifully animated, and at the same time heart warming and very funny. Wall-E is as close to perfect as you can get in my humble opinion.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you've some how never seen this, but have enjoyed other Pixar movies, then you'll have no trouble with this film. It's suitable for kids of all ages - 3 to 90!\n\nBest Format:\n\nThis is such a beautifully crafted film. So if your local theater was screening this again certainly try to make that showing. At home, add the HD version to your collection as you'll want to re-watch this one from time to time.\n\nBest moment for me:\n\nWhen Eve and Wall-E are flying/dancing through space together to Thomas Newman's superb score. It just looks and sounds fantastic.\n\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette",

            "content": "Today I got around to watching 'WALL-E', having missed all the box office and Oscar success the first time around in 2009. Although, perhaps controversially, I feel that the movie is slightly sub-par in terms of Pixar's incredibly high standards, despite being offered an incredible 8.5 rating on IMDb ('Toy Story' only has 8.3!).\n\nObviously Pixar are yet to make a bad movie, and that pattern shows no signs of changing here, but in terms of the Pixar canon ('Toy Story', 'Monsters Inc.', 'Finding Nemo') I felt the little robot with the big googly eyes wasn't quite up to standard. Yes I knew what I was letting myself in for, a robot left to clean up the planet whilst Earth's ancestors wallow away lazily in a space-station until the job's done, but I felt this story might have operated better as a Pixar short.\n\nI've just read on IMDb that the first robot dialogue occurs on the 22 minute mark, with human dialogue not introduced until 39 minutes. The movie establishes itself, and does a decent job, as a visual comedy from the outset with our lovable hero putting bras on his head and playing with paddle toys. I read that director Andrew Stanton actually watched films of silent stars Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton every lunch time for a year and a half just getting ideas for direction. And yes the characters can be empathised with, despite their relative muteness; however I don't feel this is enough to carry the movie alone. After about the 45 minute mark as opposed to giggling I found myself being irritated by the persistent cries of \"WALL-E\" and \"EVE\" along with a gazillion other robot sounds.\n\n Anyway that's about as neatly as I can put it: not bad by any stretch of the imagination, it has some good twists too, but for Pixar I feel their form has dropped just a little bit.",

The lack of concentration put in actual dialogue means the humour relies on childish visual gags with little creativity put into them. What started off as an interesting premise quickly turned into a intergalactic game of kiss chase. No doubt the mere thought of robots falling in love is bound to melt some hearts and for those people this is perfect, but alas all I felt throughout was disappointment.

In the case of WALL-E it appears to be the only moving machine on the planet earth which all it does is that it scoops up mostly metal debris before scrunching them into small blocks.  It does have a purpose as it stands for 'Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class'.   As viewers continue to observe it appears to have a small life of it's own as a result of perhaps being banged up too much with it being the only WALL-E like robot left since others are no longer functioning as wee some scrapped away.  Even though, WALL-E is carrying on it's objective, it also seems to have heart as well.  We feel for WALL-E the same way as we do for R2-D2 and C3P0, Twiki from Buck Rogers and VINCENT and BOB from \"The Black Hole\".   As the movie is progressing it seems to do what humans do whenever a sand storm is brewing for Wall-E rushes to the back of this hangar ship that's treated like a refuge, and with the stuff Wall-E has salvaged he fiddles around with them including watches TV.  The first half of the movie showcases viewers that WALL-E is a robot who is able to think for himself.  The second half centers on Wall E doing what it want it to do which is to reunite himself with the robot he's attracted to.  And we don't often see that happen very much in films with robots in them.  All of it happening was a result from a preservation of a little plant. There's also another homage to another robot that acts like the HAL robot as well from \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", and perhaps E.T..  And the environmental message is not as heavy handed as some critics really want it to be either- at least I don't think so.\r\n\r\n4 out of 4 stars",

The story is very creative and interesting. The standout moments in the movie for me were when Wall-e was just roaming the Earth and doing his best to clean up the polluted Earth. Then Eve, a droid sent to scour the Earth for life forms a special bond with the little robot. There is no dialogue in these scenes, and yet they were so well executed. The message of the film is painstakingly obvious, yet effective. The movie is touching and re-watchable. For me, I didn't think it was as outstanding as people make it out to be. The pacing was slow at times, and it isn't quite as memorable as some other Pixar classics. But Wall-e is a great science fiction film that has a lot to say about how we take care of our world. Wall-e gets 4/5 stars (A-).",

He should've sticked to the realistic theme. He added many dumb human characters to make it more worse. He gave entire human kind in the hands of only one dumb captain (WTF is this?? I know it's a kids film but YOU CALL THIS A MASTERPIECE?) and then entire human kind without any objection agrees with the captain's decision to come back on earth and to let go stress-free, wealthy, luxurious life WTF.

            "content": "Pixar Animation Studios has always found creative and imaginative ways to tell a story to movie audiences everywhere. From toys that have a life of their own, to a family of superheroes, Pixar has always done something great in terms of story. But what about a love story between a pair or robots? It sounds like a silly concept but that is the case with 2008's \"WALL-E\", a simple idea that became a huge hit. Unfortunately, the lesson that is bought up in the movie is pretty predictable, and to a lesser extent, somewhat preachy. \"WALL-E\" is a remarkable little film from Pixar, but it needs a better story.\n\nSet hundreds of years in the not too distant future, the human race has heavily polluted the Earth to a point where life is uninhabitable. Enter WALL-E, a robot that can clean up trash, but he is amazed at what humans have left behind like lighters and and a Pong machine. One day, a female robot named EVE comes to Earth and WALL-E instantly falls in love with her. EVE is looking for a plant; WALL-E finds one, and together, the two go on an extraordinary journey where an even bigger plot unfolds.\n\n\"WALL-E\" was a good attempt at Pixar trying to tell a great and interesting story. What this means is that while the first act of the movie is brilliant, the second and third acts lose on the main story of the two robots and instead focuses on these human characters that are only brought up at pivotal moment into the film's run time. Yet the interaction between WALL-E and EVE is a good relationship between characters. In fact the characters make the film work as they are memorable as well as having WALL-E and EVE having a good chemistry between the two. The visuals are amazing, as per Pixar standards, and the voice work and sound effects are incredible. The whole film has a nice vibe to it as it truly takes on the form of a sci-fi film; this is noticeable as there are numerous references to the film \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" scattered throughout the movie, down to the villain. \"WALL-E\" is an impressive feat that has one major problem.\n\nOnce WALL-E and EVE are on the spaceship, the movie goes from a message about two lovable robots, to a message about protecting our planet. This is a theme we have seen many times before in other films and it is getting redundant. The movie tries very hard to keep your main attention to our main characters, when all of a sudden, this theme of environmental safety comes into play. This is an error in an otherwise perfect movie.\n\nIn conclusion, \"WALL-E\" is good movie with great visuals and characters, but maybe Pixar needed to improve its story a bit then it would have been perfect.",

The first half of the film consists of no dialogue and just atmospheric and visual storytelling on the backdrop of a great music score. Then for some reason the filmmakers just said: \"original atmosphere? fuck that, we're going to do a pretty unoriginal second half by hammering in the message even more, changing the tone and not really deliver a massive impact on that heart thingy like the first half.\" I actually like to compare this to Martin Scorsese's Hugo: the first half is amazing but the second half changes the game completely. Is this a really huge problem? Not really. Both halves are good, but the first one is infinitely superior and the second one is kind of annoying. The second half does provide some great visuals and genuinely excellent moments such as the 'dance scene' on the outside of the spaceship. A classic? No. A good movie? You bet half your arse.",

So much so, that I \nhave now seen the film 5 times in 2 weeks, and I still don't know if I can adequately review it. It truly is one of the most interesting, and haunting visions of humanity's future ever put to the screen. To think that humanity could be so far gone that robots actually act more like humans than humans do, is just horrifying. However, Pixar manages to weave in a heartfelt and uplifting message amidst a harsh social criticism of the way we live our lives. The first thirty minutes of this film basically has no dialogue, but is filled with endless characterizations, and explain Wall-E and Eve better than most films can explain their characters throughout the whole film. You find out that Wall-E harbors very human characteristics like love, attachment, friendship, loss, sadness, happiness, rhythm, and maybe most of all, he can feel hope. This is displayed when Eve breaks his VHS, he fixes it, and waits tentatively for it to work again. But then it is also displayed when Eve is rendered lifeless by her own programming, he patiently waits by her side, protecting her from everything, in hope that she may return to life. And Eve is allowed to feel the same human things as Wall-E, but it may only be because she has had exposure to Wall-E's overwhelming goodness, and his rare association with Earth. This film is so much like all the great live action films that have such a broad scope, not everything is explicitly stated, much is left for our minds to ponder about and interpret from our own perspective. After the silence of the first thirty minutes, everything turns into utter chaos, exposing different elements of what lead to humanity's demise, as well as giving us the most imaginative look at the horrors of corporate greed, human apathy, consumerism, ecological destruction, and also, misused technology. But Wall-E is not just magnificently conceived and written, it is visually astonishing, the visuals are so well crafted that this film doesn't even need dialogue, each frame tells us the story of this picture, and could engage your eyes enough to just look at for an hour and a half. Honestly, it is Pixar's most visually significant and poetic film to date. To finish up, although Wall-E has a very bleak outlook on the future, and spends most of the film showing us how bad everything could get, it ultimately is an affirmation of the human spirit, but it does so in the most unconventional way, by giving us one of the most human characters ever put to the screen, however, he just so happens to be a robot. And I can't forget to say that Wall-E and Eve's relationship is one of the most heartwarming and special relationships ever visually and conceptually conceived. If you haven't seen Wall-E, you are really missing out.",

What's so special about WALL-E is that the main character is an innocent, lonely and little robot that all it does is cleaning our trashy planet, and yet he's a very charming character. The adventure he live takes a sci-fi feeling and yet we feel the magic. The story is far more complex than what the mind catches at first.

One thing that obviously can be commended are the visuals.  However, there is almost no dialogue and in order to buy into the movie you have to buy into the cuteness of walle as a robot.  I had trouble doing that the whole movie.  Sure it was full of emotion, I just could not invest myself in the plot line the movie wished to take.  There were three moments in the movie that I thought were quite profound however.  The first being walle holding his hands together at the start, the second being the dancing in the stars with a fire extinguisher and the last of course being the end.  The ride along the way however, took too long for me.",

            "content": "When I first watched this film I was surprised by the unique approach this film took. It used a lot of atmosphere yet very little dialogue and few characters. This film has great pacing and uses it's subtly to its advantage. The story is strait forward and although the climax feels somewhat forced in, it does allow for a great dramatic ending. \nThere is an environmental message in the film about some Walmart/Coca Cola/Mc Donalds company that is such a powerful and corrupt monopoly that they influence politics, allowing them to pollute the world and not giving a crap about anything but money- you know, like in real life. Overall it does create a history to the story and why things are the way they are. There still is some mystery behind the past because only certain parts of the history are cut and past in certain parts of the film, so even if you do peace things together it leaves gaps but still makes perfect sense. Of all the 'crappy futures' that films and videogames make, this seem very realistic. It's more of humanity screwing itself over because of human natures and what modern trends would do if they got out of control. All the other films think that everything is a half-life warzone, here it's either no life at all or the spaceship where everyone thinks they are good and living off Walmart/Coca Cola/Mc Donalds products. And judging by how fat everything is today, this film got that right.\nWall-E is pretty much a box with wheels, but is A-DOR-A-BLE. His curiosity and loneliness makes him so innocent but enough of a troublemaker to make him interesting and realistic. I also like how old and weak he is, because this would make him handicapped in such a futuristic world yet still he can be heroic.\nEve is the first futuristic technology that appears in the film. Pretty much designed to be a weapon or being able to defend herself, she is the exact opposite of the frail and old Wall E, which is great for the film.\nIn a way the 'romance' between the robots, which doesn't make much sense in theory, is mostly about Eve's evolution throughout the film. The chemistry between the two robots is realistic in a way, it takes a lot of time for Eve just to identify that Wall E is not a threat. It is by no way a 'love at first sight' deal, (well maybe it is for Wall E) but the relationship derails in the film. I love the scene where Eve is legitimately pissed off at Wall E in the elevator, not a lot of romance films would attempt this idea.\nThe villain is pretty weak, just your typical evil computer that have full control of the tech in the ship. It's just Hal 9000 as a robot, nothing more. Out of all the Pixar villains, he is one of the weakest simply because he's not original AT ALL. Luckily he's not in the film for long.\nThe Captain I think was a good character, just because you get to see what a typical human on the ship would act. There are two background characters, one voiced by Ham, which you see but The Captain is the one that is more focused on. Thank god for that, because you get to see that the humans as a whole are not careless or stupid, they just are ignorant from the world that was censored from them and instead they are literally large babies living in the world of Walmart/Coca Cola/Mc Donalds instead of reality. \nThere are other robots throughout the film and although they are 'cute' like Wall E, they have many personalities, abilities and faults to them. They remind me of Andy's Toys because there are so colorful and can help Wall E or the story yet at the same time are not in the way.\nOverall this film is very clever in what it does. I mean good god, there's a love scene with a fire extinguisher! NO ONE would have thought about that idea! The setting feels like it has history, the characters have great personalities, and the atmosphere and music is astonishing. It reminds me of Ratatoulie's atmosphere only with better characters and story, oh and the future theme of course.\nOutside of the weak Villain, I see almost nothing wrong with this film and is one of my favorite films of all time.",

The desolate landscape once known as Earth has been stripped of all living things. Robots were left to clean up the mess. Wall-E is a quirky lovable little robot who cleans up trash. He silently goes through the pillars of trash collecting. From his rusty metal home to the depths of outer space, the film showcases spectacular visuals, while showcasing a spectacular story. Humor is constant, even when no words are spoken. Th little bleeps from robots and their personalities drive the film.  \n   This is a must watch.

It is a high concept, high art, and (unusual for a high concept, high art movie) high budgeted monstrously beautiful film that I don't think should be called a family film, it is the one film that should be called an everyone film, a film that has an equal chance of appealing to anyone (though I do know a few people who don't like it, and even though I understand their viewpoint, I strongly disagree). What makes it a masterpiece. Let's start with the most important part of any movie (in my opinion at least) the atmosphere. This film is dripping with beautiful atmosphere, I mean you can cut it with a knife. The first 40 minutes are by far the most atmospheric moments in film history. It combines humor, drama, mystery, familiarity, romance, loneliness, basically everything that makes great atmosphere. One they go up into space the atmosphere isn't quite as strong, but it makes up for it in so many ways. The setting is one of the most dark, yet ideological ones ever put to screen. It is scary, yet welcoming in a way that we are looking at all human's weaknesses and strengths.The message is one of the most important ones ever put to screen, yet it gives the rest of the movies more than enough space to breath. The message compliments the plot perfectly in the way where you can tell that it is mostly trying to use human flaws and blessings to tell a story instead of just making a movie to send a message. When it comes to the visuals, like \"The Seventh Seal\" any still in this movie can be put in a portrait and hung in an art museum. There is just so much beauty and meaning to every shot that it is basically the best looking film ever made, both on a technical and artistic level. The characters are great too, of course there is Wall-e, an idealist of a robot with a heart of gold forced to survive for hundreds of years in a wasteland created by the people who created him. I also love how the humans all have their flaws exaggerated yet still remain likable. The captain is my favorite, he is like a child while discovering his ancestors accomplishments, full of wonder and hope and shows what there is to like about humankind. Nobody but him can say the line \"Pizza Tree\" without making it cringe inducingly corny, but his wonder and hope sells it. The music is perfect in creating the Sci-fi atmosphere of hope and wonder, and Peter Gabriel's \"Down to Earth\" is just the cherry on the cream of this movie. If I did have one flaw with this movie is that the physical villain is a little weak, but what lessens the impact is that to me the Hal-9000esc villain is not the true villain. Hopelessness, indifference, and the desire to give up is the true villain of this movie which is pretty deep for a film mostly made for kids. Wall-e is one the greatest films (animated or otherwise) ever made, and my personal favorite film. It is just the perfect example of how even mainstream family films can be high art and relevant experiences.",

            "content": "'Wall-E' is rated G and it has more artistic merit than any other film I've seen in the year 2008 thus far. I hardly have anything bad to say about the film, which is charming, enchanting, mesmerizing, and gorgeous with every shot! The film revolves around an ugly, mechanical heap of a robot named Wall-E, who is more endearing and cute than the Kung Fu Panda who, despite being designed to be cute, turns out to be gross and unappealing. Wall-E has everything going against it. It's story involves two robots who fall in love, it has hardly any dialogue, and it uses a variety of music from classic musicals, most notably: Hello Dolly, Wall-E's favorite musical. In fact, this movie has been made in the same light as any classic movie, especially 2001: A Space Odyssy, which the movie references several times. While in the theatre, I could sense that I was watching a classic, a movie that appeals to everyone and that will live on forever. The film, which is by far my favorite Pixar film, was directed by Andrew Stanton who also claims the next best Pixar film: Finding Nemo. There are no short cuts made, there are no gimmicks, or talking down to kids. Hopefully, this movie will help people realize that animation is NOT a genre. It's a medium. This is not a movie for kids. It wasn't made for kids. It was made for everyone. The fact that, in my showing of the film, there was not a single child there, thrills the hell out of me. The fact is, Pixar is getting better and better. They knew they had to start out making children's films (Toy Story, A Bug's Life), and they have evolved to the point of making movies for adults, with last year's substantially sophisticated 'Ratatouille' and this year's phenomenal, and life changing, 'Wall-E'.",

In any case Pixar really know how to get me right in the heart! BASTARDS.",
