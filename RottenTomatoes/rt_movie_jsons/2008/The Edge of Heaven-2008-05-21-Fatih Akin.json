When Yeter dies in an altercation with Ali, Nejat goes to find her daughter in Istanbul. Ayten, Yeter's daughter, escapes from Turkey when her political activism threatens her life. In Germany, she falls for a girl, Lotte (Patrycia Ziolkowska), who follows her to Istanbul when she is deported.",

            "content": "Fatih Akin's The Edge of Heaven is a complex tapestry of a film about the immigrant experience and the unbroken thread one may have that continues to attach them to their homeland.  Both the characters and the story are fascinating as the film alternates between Istanbul and Bremen, following individuals who have escaped the complex social and political structure of Turkey for the stability of Germany, only to find themselves drawn back to their country of origin.  Despite the remarkable number of absurd coincidences, some of which serve no discernable purpose other than to make the viewer think \u2018oh, what a coincidence', the movie is gripping throughout thanks to the complex story, strong performances, and interesting locales.",

            "content": "This was an interesting glimpse into Germany's Turkish community. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting based on the short synopsis printed on the cover, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The coincidences between the parallel stories seemed perhaps a little too contrived at times, but there was a good cast of characters, which created interest, including a retired Turkish gentleman, his Turkish mistress and his professor son, the mistress's revolutionary daughter and others.",
