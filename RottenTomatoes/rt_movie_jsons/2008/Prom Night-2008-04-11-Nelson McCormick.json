            "content": "Very much a forgotten contributor to the Slasher era of the 90's / 00's, but Prom Night offers all the usual fun and cliched entertainment that this genre of movie always does. After Donna witnessed the murder of all her family upon returning home one night, she has been plagued with depression and hallucinations that her former teacher, and killer of her relations, would someday return to finish her off too. Of course, after much build up, he finally does make a reappearance after escaping the jail he was held in, typically on the night of her senior prom. As her friends keep finding a reason to wander off on their own, you just know they will all be picked off one by one, and the police officers are about as helpful as a chocolate fire guard in ensuring all the cast dies until that moment when the lead star is about to get butchered. To be fair, it does play on the suspense element and there are some jumpy moments, but seeing the killer from the offset somehow takes away the element of surprise and mystery that you often enjoy from regular whodunnit masked killer movies. I'm not familiar with any of the cast members which is unsurprisingly why this perhaps wasn't advertised as much as other horrors, but they do do a good job in ensuring a solid 90 minutes of entertainment. I had seen this before, but admittedly forgotten much about it as there's no particularly original or gruesome scenes that make it memorable. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it as it's very easy watching material and very much taps into one of my many cheesy weaknesses. It definitely shows my immature side as I'd say this is mainly appealing for a teenage target market, albeit perhaps not the perfect viewing for the night before their prom :)",

I doubt even slasher films would come to find anyyhing decent about this film. In fact the only thing that is stopping me from giving this film no stars is the cinematogrophy and acting. Tye acting however is barely servicable. Brittany Snow is a good actor but has not much to but think about the future and scream all the time. The killer is your typical lunatic whi is after Snows character. This guy barely mentions a word except for a line he says differntly each time he is with Snows character. The story itself leave alot to be wanting. There is no positive to the end besides the killer being put to death. Although given what Snows character ends up in the end. I wouldnt be surprised to be amongst the living anymore. The film is just to cruel when it comes to killing off characters. So cruel that it'll leave you dissapointed. It might even leave you wondering what the writers and director where thinking when they decided to be a s creul as they can be to the characters. This ultumately the flaw of the film. One other major one is that everyone who dies gets ans offscreen death! I mean if you make a slasher film show the death! But like I said they were cruel enough to the characters as it is. Every death almost feels like an action scene. Grear camera work but not scary and ad I mentioned no death. The decade has passed and I believe this is the worst film of the decade by alot even beating Daddy Day Camp on my list.",

Mix it all together and you've got CRAP!",
