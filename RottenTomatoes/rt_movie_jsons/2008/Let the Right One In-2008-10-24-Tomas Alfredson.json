Eventually, Eli shares her dark, macabre secret with Oskar, revealing her connection to a string of bloody local murders.",

A small amount of unnecessary characters to fill in the allotted time.  Overall, quite enjoyable for a foreign film and a nice change of pace from the action-packed vampire fare that is typical for western audiences .",

This originality still disturbs over grisly approaches and vampiric instincts, it nicely took a step back rather appropriately under a similar classical form that mostly radiates through results as part of the film's striking imagery and agreeable modernization of the vampire film without any cheesy facade. Soulfully at the center, there's genuine chemistry finely pulled off by the young main pair with recognizably felt gravitas, which arguably rank them as one of the best cinematic couples as they elevate the film outside the violence and irrational disturbances therefore representing the basis purity.

            "content": "This story marks the first time that I watch a \"remake\" first then the \"original\". Why did I put these words in quotes? When \"Let Me In\" (2010) was released, there was a huge polemic because \"Let the Right One In\" (this one) was released only 2 years before, it was universally acclaimed and won significant awards, like at Tribeca Film Festival, Empire Awards and Saturn Awards. So the main question was \"why the 2010 film was made?\". John Ajvide Lindqvist, the writer of the original book (released in 2004) and the screenwriter of the Swedish 2008 version, shared his opinion which I agree with: it's not a remake, it's another adaptation of the same book (even the film rights were acquired by Hammer Films at the Tribeca Film Festival). Matt Reeves (the director of the 2010 version) publicly said that he loves both the book and the 2008 film. Okay, after this non-brief contextualisation, let's finally talk about \"Let the Right One In\". I can prefer Matt Reeves' version, mainly because Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson have less charisma and chemistry than Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee, but they're far from bad. In general, the cast of the 2010 version is slightly better, but it seems impossible to err with this story because it's simply brilliant! I can't define if this narrative is a horror, a thriller, or a romance, it's tense and cute at the same time. And after watching two spectacular adaptations of the same story, I want to read the base book, which, fortunately, was translated into Brazilian Portuguese. The contextualization was longer than the review itself because I would almost only repeat everything I said in my review of the 2010 version, they're pretty similar in lots of aspects (the vampire girl's apartment is a bit different, and I prefer the 2010 version), but both are amazing and worth your time. This was the only story that managed to make me take vampires seriously, and I'll praise it for that forever.",

Still, this film strikes me on many level.\n\nLet the Right One In resonated with me, and not just because I like horror movies. I found myself identifying with Oskar from the outset, sympathizing with him during his torment, longing to protect him from the evils of his life, and nodding with understanding when he stood alone in the playground, stabbing a tree with a knife and pretending it was one of his tormentors.\n\nIt was because of this connection that I totally welcomed Eli into the story. I saw Eli as Oskar saw her, and I sensed his great relief when he came to realize that there was another in the world who wanted to understand him. Even though Eli was clearly different, a vampire for that matter, still, she was the one who saw Oscar for what he was, a lonely gentle soul tormented by bullies.\n\nYou see, this film went beyond the vampire and romantic stuff that we could see in other movies, deeply overused. It uses it clerverly, gently, put us in the shoes of those two gentle and broken young souls and guides us through their journey of understanding, friendship and maybe more without overlooking the scary things that can happen along the way.",

You know, the one who only leaves the house after dark, climbs through third-floor windows without a ladder and appears just as the town is stunned by a string of violent murders? That girl. She's into some ghastly shit, obviously, but the glimmer of friendship these kids nurture is sweet and pure, a complete antithesis to all the dark acts that, by necessity, she gets up to when they're apart. Two lost souls who finally find comfort in the vast, dark expanse.\n\nThere's a lot left unspoken in Let the RIght One In; subtle hints about how these relationships have worked for her in the past, a broad sense of penitence and a reluctance to let it happen again. She knows what she is, tries to warn him away, but they both feel the connection and he's persistent about getting closer. Being around her gives him the strength to take command of his own life and make meaningful changes. There's inherent conflict here - she's good for him AND bad for him - that causes a melancholic sense of imminence to loom like a specter over both lives. By the story's end, one conflict is resolved (a more up-front plot involving those school bullies) but the greater issue is left open-ended. Does the cycle continue? Is the circle bound to remain unbroken? It's left to the viewer to draw their own conclusions.",

            "content": "Sheer terror and tender romance in bleak Sweden.\n\nDirector Tomas Alfredson's Swedish coming of age romantic horror drama Let the Right One In (2008) is a beautiful contemporary take on vampires. He never outright tells you details, but rather suggests everything you want to know with his striking visual storytelling as director. No wonder this film made waves across the world and let him direct my favorite spy thriller Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. I am quite moved by the genuinely romantic feeling and beautiful filmmaking of Let the Right One In.\n\nDirector Tomas Alfredson finds refreshing sympathy for lonely children who want friendship and love as he depicts a bullied child trying to find his courage within Let the Right One In. Even the title refers to both the idea that you must invite a vampire into your home as well as you must find the right person to invite into your heart. Writer John Ajvide Lindqvist creates complex hurt characters with his young leads, who just want warmth in their life. It's a sublime feature with some bloody horror, sweet romance, cute friendship, and harrowing darkness of Sweden's oppressive winters. Let the Right One In looks at how we care for, raise, ignore, or neglect children as well as how kids can overcome their parents' weakness.\n\nCinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema's gorgeous close-ups let you see every emotion in his subject's eyes, while his sparse wide shots reveal isolating Sweden and the harshness of loneliness. Editors Tomas Alfredson and Dino Jons\u00e4ter grip you with sharply cut scenes for 115 minutes of horror and romance. You only see what you need to see within Hoytema's mysterious framing. Eva Noren's desolate production design makes you feel like the characters are suffering in these lonesome homes.\n\nKare Hedebrant is excellent as Oskar. You see all his hurt feelings and loneliness in his pained eyes and sullen body language. He is delivering a dramatic performance that is subtle beyond his years as a child actor. He's quite impressive. Lina Leandersson is wonderful as the vampire girl Eli. She portrays a nuanced loneliness in her large, dark eyes that is so naturally expressive. You can tell Eli wants friendship or companionship of some kind as she slowly warms up to Oskar. Lina is fun to watch play a fearsome vampiress as well as an affectionate young girl. She really is remarkable, delivering one of cinema's greatest child actress performances. Let the Right One In boasts fantastic lead actor and lead actress roles.\n\nPer Ragnar is fascinating as the solemn old man Hakan, who goes out at night to drain his victims of their blood for Eli. He's so expressive even with only a few lines. You can feel a kindness in him. Peter Carlberg is great as the old drunken Swedish lush Lacke, who figures out the neighborhood vampirism too late.\n\nComposer Johan S\u00f6derqvist scores Let the Right One In with haunting disquieting melodies and suddenly ramping up his music for the intense horror sequences. I love how refined and romantic his music sounds for Let the Right One In. Maria Strid's costumes are all cute fuzzy 1980's style Swedish sweaters, hats, coats, and pants. Everyone looks cozy. Maria Strid's make-up, on the other hand, makes everyone look cold and pale, which is perfect for a vampire film.\n\nIn all, I loved Let the Right One In and will always find it both unnerving and romantic. Tomas Alfredson's sincere direction allows you to relate to a sweet Swedish boy and a vampire girl.",

It is a horror film by definition and has more than its fair share of blood and violence, but Let The Right One In relies more on atmosphere to create chills.  The dialogue is minimal, the shots are nicely framed, the takes are long with lots of subtle camera movement, the acting is subdued, and the music score is appropriately spooky but not overbearing.

The youthful emotion between the lovers in the movie feels sincere. However, there are a number of side characters, we know little to nothing about, that merely exist to further the plot. The acting throughout is subdued which is fine, but with a plot that feels mostly the same and barely moves into second gear, I hoped for more. Nonetheless, while the directing and camera work is acceptable too, there are a few shots which I found alluring. Overall, the idea for the movie is good, but the execution could have been better as a number of scenes in the film offer very little and could have been cut to improve the film's pace and lower its runtime.",

            "content": "North Americans have seen more than their share of vampire movies, so we've come to expect the expected when another one premieres on the big screen. But leave it to the Swedes to break the long-set mould, with the haunting, yet placid Let the Right One In, Tomas Alfredson's theatrical take on a 2004 novel by fellow Swede John Ajvide Lindqvist, who also tackled the screenplay.\n\nThe producers were intent on finding young actors who displayed chemistry onscreen, accurately casting two 13-year-old unknowns, Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson. The former portrayed Oskar, a 12-year-old boy who spends his free time daydreaming of bloody retaliation on schoolyard bullies. Leandersson makes us forget that she's barely a teenager, with her role as a somewhat androgynous vampire named Eli, who has been \"12, about\" for the last 200 years. Eli and her \"guardian\" Hakan (Per Ragner) have just moved in next door to Oskar in a sombre apartment complex in the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg, where Hakan is committed to murdering locals in order to salvage their blood so that Eli doesn't have to.\n\nOskar leads a lonely exsistance, something he has in common with Eli, the two of whom converse at the nearby playground before eventually striking up an alliance and going \"steady.\" Alfredson is sporadically loyal to Lindqvist's novel--which is set in the early-'80s--delivering an almost pederastic tone to the children's relationship, one that leaves my \"Americanized\" eyes awkward and uneasy at times.\n\nThe film seems to climax during a disturbingly graceful pool scene that left me ecstaticly jolted, and lends some much-needed energy to its slow pace. John Soderqvist composed a melodic score for this film, light at times, dark at others, setting every tone of every scene, and delivered by the Slovak National Symphony Orchestra.\n\nIn a year that saw massive attention and fascination for Hollywood's own vampire contribution, Twilight, Let the Right One In distanced itself from big-budget glamour and poised itself as an alternative, highlighting its foreign authenticity (it was filmed and set in Sweden, and comes sub-titled) at the risk of feeble international ticket sales. Unlike Twilight, Alfredson's film will not expand into a blockbuster franchise, or produce any teen-girl glee or even action figures for that matter, but it will leave you more satisfied than its exploited rival, I'm sure. Although this film's stars aren't even high school students yet, this is a very-adult movie, one that tangles with its own essence to trigger self-awareness in its audience. Mission accomplished.\n\n*This review was originally written in 2009.",

That's fine and all, but too much of those types of films takes away from the actual underlying principle - the horror. Let the Right One In is as much a romance and coming-of-age tale as it is a horror film, but it very importantly does not forget or marginalize the scares. Tightly shot and engaging, the film capitalizes on some great performances from young leads Hedebrant and Leandersson, as well as some great period set design to create a horror film that feels high-quality and doesn't resort to jumpscares, relying on atmosphere and tension as most good horror does. One modern horror flick destined to become a classic. (4/5)",

There's some genuine acting, especially from the younger group, which makes the characters seem part of their subtly fantastic world. There is a heartwarming aspect to this movie, but it's distant, buried under ice cold bodies and awkward pubescent moments. There's also the heartwrenching aspect as we watch the bullies slowly turning the boy into a sociopath. The sanguine bits are saturated with a dark humor. So while the killing is horrifying and terrible, there's also that thing that makes all the death slightly askew.

Will Eli be caught and confronted with her crimes? Will Oskar stand up for himself enough to end the harrassment? Will Eli have to take out the bully jackholes?

Look, I've seen better vampire movies, vampires are rich, they live in nice houses and have fancy clothes, not only a bunch of rings and some money stolen from their victims, in an apartment with cardboard on the window and no furniture, They travel in luxury coffins, have their own car\\plane\\boat... She's just a Loser, vampires have fun so make the audience have fun too. Sorry... I am so ignorant to want to stick to the usual clich\u00e9s? You know, life is not always a fairy tale, if I watch a movie I want to see something nicer or more special than anything I could see in real life, no need for decadent, dull and sad settings I can find just anywhere.

Now we learn that Eli hides a bloody secret. She is a vampire!\nWhere as Oskar dreams of bloody revenge\nShe needs to kill to survive basically.\nNow the film doesn't just go of on a bloodthirsty tangent. The relationship between the two is developed.\nDirector Thomas Alfredson created one of his best films before Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy came along in 2010.\nEvery now and then a foreign language film has to be tried.

I just decided to hell with it and buy the blu ray. My eyes were glued to the screen while watching this film, and it almost hypnotized me. I did not expect the movie to be a horror/romance, and those genres meld together greatly in this movie. There are times where I'm terrified, and there are times where I feel soft inside. These feelings for me melded in such a unique way in the \"pool scene\". The film has beautiful cinematography and the shots of the swedish winter looked entrancing. The 2 young leading actors in this film had great performances, especially Lina Leandersson. The screenplay was also masterful because it somehow made the film half romance, half horror, and those genres didn't overtake each other. They were exactly 50/50 in this movie, and it is surprisingly a great mix of genres. The movie is a perfect length, and Tomas Alfredson directed this film with mastery. I wonder what happened to him in 2017 though, *cough cough* The Snowman. Everyone should check out this movie, It really deserves a 5/5.",

I\u0092m not saying that the movie is bad or deeply flawed, it simply seemed run-of-the-mill and unoriginal. Is it the fact that this time the story of the vampire and human falling in love happens between pre-teens? Let the Right One In is a basic coming-of-age drama with a vampire thrown in. I can see this appealing to some viewers because those are genres that are both beloved, and mashing them together works surprisingly well. Perhaps I\u0092m not the right audience since coming-of-age is not a style of movie I love, and horror I tend to actively hate.\n\nThe style of Let the Right One In is very quiet and slow, two words that don\u0092t typically get me excited. I\u0092m not usually all that fond of reading subtitles, but there is so little said in this movie that it didn\u0092t become much of a problem. The thing is, I wasn\u0092t sure what I was supposed to be feeling in these slow silent moments. Was there tension I was missing out on? It seemed pretty obvious what was going to happen at any given moment, so I never felt nervous for anyone, and I certainly never jumped in surprise. I mean the whole theme of the movie is that Eli is a friend, so we\u0092re not supposed to be scared of her, at least I hope we weren\u0092t intended to be scared because I wasn\u0092t.\n\nThere are many parts of Let the Right One In that puzzled me. For instance, it stops in the middle of the movie to show Oskar playing games with his father, and they\u0092re interrupted by some other guy. As soon as the scene ended I instantly thought \u0093Wait, what was the point of that?!?\u0094 There are other scenes that felt superfluous like this, and I couldn\u0092t help wondering if I missed something. Also there were a few moments that made me laugh out loud and I don\u0092t think they were intended to at all, but they looked so silly I couldn\u0092t help it. Now it may come across as though I\u0092m being hypercritical of Let the Right One In, as if I hated it, but that was not the case. It\u0092s an OK movie, just nothing special.",

Thus NO spoilers :-)\n\nThis is really a fantastic film and one of the best, which I ever saw - and I have seen many many films. I watched \"L\u00e4tt den r\u00e4tta komma in/Let the right one in (LTROI)\" in the Swedish original with subtitles. In Germany usually ALL films are dubbed, which I loathe.\nI generally love to see films in the original version, because that feels simply \"more genuine\" than any dubbed voices.\n\n1. the Swedish here contributes a great deal to the singularly melancholy tendency of the film. Another wow-aspect: the unbelievably great music-score, which NEVER forces itself upon, as like much too often in other films. And thus this Score supports/fosters the atmosphere in a simply magnificent way (the US-remake \"let me in\" - LMI - lacks this quality completely - too bad!)\n2. the two young actors do act completely more unspectacular and natural - particularly Lina Leandersson as Vampirella Eli is fanatstic. She manages to enact her characters Eli in a way, that arouses compassion and affection for her and she also creates one of the most memeorable vampires of the entire history of film. Eli became truely 3-dimensional and alive for me. Very awesome!\n3. the integrated coming off age part with first love/affection is told in such a marvelous visual language and patience that it was really a true benefit for me. Nothing here feels fake or specially designed-in. Oskar and Eli let me sympathize emotionally so much with them.\n4. furthermore there are several takes and scenes, which I am never about to forget. Not to mention the virtuoso camera, which pleased me extremely well.\nThe original scenes were filmed in the winter with up to -30 degrees in north Sweden - and thus they feel so much more genuine and right, than the obviously way cheaper fake cgi-FX from New-Mexico USA in the remake LMI. (e.g. see the swaths when breathing out in the cold winter air).\n5. the direction also provides some shock moments, required for a real vampire story, yet only to surprise me with a scene of such delicate tenderness and silent poetry shortly thereafter. Unbelievably beautiful. And kind of fairy-tale-ish. I loved that aspect.\n-------------\nL\u00e4tt den r\u00e4tta komma in/Let the right one in (LTROI) is superior to the US-remake LMI in literally ANY REGARD.\nNot, because the original is always better by mere definition, but:\n\na) because of see above 1st and 4th aspect.\nb) the 2 main characters in the original are \"more alive and real\", have more intelligent dialogues (the dialogues between the two US-kids in the remake LMI are so shallow and stupid, it is really hard to believe!) and hence their fate also affects me so much more.\nc) because some of the best scenes from the original were dropped, for what strange reason ever.\n\nAll in all LTROI creates an almost impossible blend/split between cruelty and tenderness, and this is truely great art !!!\n\nLet me in - on the other hand only is exciting entertainment cinema with some shock elements supplied. (approx. 3 - 4 stars)\nHowever it is probably just perfectly sufficient for undemanding US mainstream audiences.\n\nRating = 95% (MASTERPIECE)\n######################################################################95%",

The young age of the characters may shock and disturb some people, but it is grimly honest and very realistic in many ways. It takes a while to flesh itself out, but a story about a lonely outcast boy develops into a story of friendship, love, and vampires. It is romance and a drama primarily and a horror movie second. The vampire attacks and killing are not the focus. The vampire lure here supports the movie's focus, which is the development of two young characters. The desolate and icy Swedish winter setting is stark, colorless and empty. Even daytime scenes at the beginning seem appropriately unnerving. That tension remains constant throughout the film thanks to the discretion and good direction of Tomas Alfredson. Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson, the main characters, nail the off-putting in their behavior and physical appearance to make their characters fit the story. The subject matter is dark and has strong themes of sexuality but the filmmakers bravely remained true to the emotional story without candy coating it. These are kids just beginning to transition to adolescence, making the nature of their relationship important to the story. It is a well-written dramatic story of two outsiders with hints of mystery, some gruesome violence, and the ugliness of the world in general. At the same time, there is also beautiful companionship and heart. I highly recommend it, but it is not for the highly conservative crowd or for people looking for thrills of a murderous killing spree.",

            "content": "Let The Right One In is a superb and stunning movie that delivers loads of thrills, tension, suspense, atmosphere and stand out performances while it also tries to balance intelligence in its impressive storyline at the same time. Let The Right One In tells the story of a young 12 year old bullied boy name Oskar who lives in a lonely life where he gets picked on by a bunch of bullies and has problems as well surrounding his parents' divorce. But everything in his life is about to change when he suddenly meets and befriends a beautiful yet strange 12 year old girl name Eli who lives with her guardian Hakan. Oskar soon learns that Eli is something else as he learns about her secrets as more murders start to occur where he soon learns that she is in fact a vampire but Oskar's friendship and feelings for Eli grow than his fear for her and Oskar must make a choice either to help and join Eli or avoid her at all costs. I love this movie as much as I love reading the novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist and despite several changes it still works really well. For me this is a great adaptation of Lindqvist's novel of the same name and it is also an example of how to make a good adaptation of a successful novel without mistreating the formula itself. Not only that this film is also an example of a well told vampire story that offers something slightly different and new in the vampire genre and in my honest opinion I appreciate this film over the horrible Twilight Saga. This is an anti Twilight movie and for those who hate Stephanie Meyer's Twilight novels then you will like this movie more and something also worth your time. What I like about Let The Right One In is how this movie deals with its basic concept in the vampire genre since vampire movies today start losing a lot of blood due to the Twilight movies horrible performance and how it treats the vampire genre. But in Let The Right One In everything was done right from the introduction until the conclusion because this movie handles the vampire genre in a proper way by also making the concept more based on the mythology surrounding vampires like exploring their strengths and weaknesses and it is done in a proper way without insulting the formula and concept itself. I love also the major setting of this movie and the Blackberg town itself is just as beautiful and stunning as in the novel and the snow in certain parts of the film gives it a beautiful yet eerie look because you get to see tons of shots of the glooming and snowy town with lots of people roaming around and doing their daily routines its like you're entering some sort of place that you haven't visited and you are eager to travel to that place and it fits well for the tone of the film. The other highlights of this movie is that this film is packed with tons of scenes that are stunning, beautiful, memorable, scary, creepy and frightening as well combined with a superb eerie silence that sets the mood and dark tone of the film(The incredible sequence where Hakan drugs and hangs a boy upside down and slits his throat and grabs a lot of blood for Eli, the shocking sequence where Hakan pours acid in his face before he was discharged to the hospital, Hakan's dramatic death, the suspenceful bridge attack sequence where Jocke gets killed by Eli, Jocke's body found by a bunch of kids in the ice skating rink, the suspenceful tree attack sequence, the dramatic and yet shocking death of Hakan, Oskar splitting Conny's ear in the ice skating rink, Eli bleeding slowly from her eyes and ears, Virginia getting burned by the sunlight and the silent finale in the swimming pool where the three bullies are murdered at the hands of Eli along with the beautiful ending) plus I love the surprising character development and the introduction of the two main characters both Oskar and Eli were so likable and 100% mature at the same time. One of the other things I like about this movie is the themes of the film. If you read the novel then you know what the themes and tones are in this movie but if you haven't yet let me tell you. I love the certain aspect and themes of this movie and the themes in this film are amazing which is about the dark side of a human being like bullying and of course issues surrounding divorce etc.... These themes really create a dark mood and feeling for the film and these are the themes and tones that are very realistic in the concept and execution and it also creates a very dark feel this also includes first love and more and it sets the tone in a proper and darker direction. Also while the movie is missing lots of parts and characters from the novel(Oskar's other friend Tommy, Eli drinking a few bits of Tommy's blood, Hakan coming back to life as a vampire and attempting to kill Eli) it really worked well for me a lot despite changes like Hakan a pedophile and more. Now the acting is impressive. All of the casts did an amazing job with their performances in this movie but I truly appreciate and praise the performances of the two child actors(Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson and hey Lina Leandersson is cute and gorgeous in this film) while the rest did the same thing. Director Tomas Alfredson did an amazing job with his work on this movie and he managed to turn John Ajvide Lindqvist's screenplay into a dark, dramatic and suspenceful Horror film that combines romance elements done in a well balanced way and John Ajvidde Lindqvist's screenplay captures the breathtaking and beautiful feel of the overall movie and it gave the film a very haunting yet moody feel at the exact same time. Overall Let The Right One In is a superb yet beautiful, stunning and breathtaking Horror film that reinvents the vampire genre in a satisfying way and it also captures the haunting feel of the novel at the same time. This movie gets a 10.4/10.",

The film focuses on the relationship between the two kids and only sparingly features any horror or vampire attack scenes.  I liked how the movie played out but at times things got a little dull, and reading words off the screen didn't help matters much.

            "content": "Let the Right One In is an incredible, confidently subversive piece of filmmaking unlike anything I have seen before or since. This Swedish horror film is a unique take on the vampire genre with plenty of horrific sequences, but at its core the film is about a romance/friendship that blossoms between young loner Oskar, played by Kare Hedebrant, and his new vampire neighbour Eli, played by Lina Leandersson. Both child actors (both 13 at the time) deliver mesmerising, multi-layered and mature performances that far exceed their years - convincingly portraying the tragically beautiful and relatable kinship that develops between these two lonely souls. Perhaps the most striking element of Let the Right One In is it's undeniably intoxicating atmosphere. With the backdrop of snowy 1980s Stockholm, the film uses sparse shots of open scenery, bare composition and a very minimalistic soundscape in order to tap into an eerie sense of loneliness, sadness and isolation that you can't help let consume you. The film unfolds at its own slow, meticulous pace with long shots and minimal dialogue; showing rather than telling as the bullied Oskar develops his first meaningful friendship with Eli.\nAlfredson expertly balances horror, drama and romance, implicating themes of childhood innocence and love within the realm of horror, violence and natural cruelty. The understated performances of the two leads give weight and investment to the onscreen romance, and the chilling, brutal savagery that takes place around them packs a more visceral and emotional punch as we desperately root for these characters to find the warmth and happiness in each other that they long for within such a cold and lonely world.\nLet the Right One In is in a league of its own as a profoundly poetic and haunting film that reminds us of the depth that can be achieved within the horror genre.",

While their relationship is a good one, I find myself drawn more to the other characters. What the heck is going on with Oskar's parents? Granted yeah they are divorced, but why? What is up with his dad and his \"drinking\" buddy? I see very little development surrounding his parents and it makes me wonder why Oskar doesn't tell his mom about his issues? And sorry...but the fake CG cats attacking the lady Eli bit...that sure put this down a few pegs. And how long was Eli's keeper with her? And who was he to her? What's her background? Like I said, all these questions I have and none are answered. And it wasn't in the least bit scary.",

While at times bloody and just as dreary and bleak as the isolated souls within Oskar and Eli, underneath the film's grimness is a coming-of-age tale that bares more heart and soul than the average viewer might expect to find.\n\nFull review at http://silverscreenfanatic.com/2015/04/07/benjamins-stash-66/",

The tone itself is very consistent, dark, gloomy and a little depressing, dressed in a white and cold swedish winter. The child actors are very good, even if I noticed one or too slip-ups, and the story that is told is very well done. They excluded some parts of the book and I feel it totally fits. The filmmakers stuck it to the root of the story which is this fantastic love story between vampire and little, blonde boy.",

Based on the novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist, this is a heartbreaking story filled with many memorable moments that allow the film to break out of the typical vampire cliches. The characters are likable and the central theme of bullying is one that hits hard. It's a movie about how children react to bullying, and the fact that there are vampires is placed on the back burner. It's a wonderful film.",

This is a story of a relationship between a troubled young boy and a vampire, told without needless violence or blood and guts flying around the screen, which seems to come hand in had with most modern vampire films (if they're not aimed at 12 year old girls). This, instead, is a rare type of horror that focuses more on the characters than the jump scares and gore; and this realism, to me, makes it even more sinister. \nOn top of this, it's brilliantly shot, written and acted, especially considering the two lead character were played by children. But, being a horror film, it has a few plot holes and flaws that can't be ignored, but can be forgiven if you take into account all the positives there are. \nSo despite the flaws, it all adds up to create the best vampire film I have ever seen, and is definitely up there with some of the best horrors, not because of how scary it is, but because of how emotionally engaging, different and well made it is.

The small-town bleak winter setting encapsulates the steady melancholy of Oscar and Eli's struggles, the way they feel permanently oppressed by who they are, at least in relation to society. It's a great example of what genre fiction can achieve when it employs its superficial trappings and mythology to effectively amplify and explore human experience.\n\nI agree that the adults in the film seem paper-thin compared to the child protags.

Everything works perfectly. \n\nThe camerawork is phenomenally well done, and the atmosphere is just unbelieveable. The acting is some of the greatest you can get from this generation's teen actors/actresses. Both Hedebrandt and Leandersson transcend their characters with such a grace and heartfelt emotion that you cannot help but admire it. \n\nCalling this a movie about forbidden romance is really cutting it short. In the same style as Pan's Labyrinth, you can draw two different conclusions to the story where both interpretations makes just as much sense as the other. But where the movie shines brightest is probably in how mature and valid a story this is, despite having some classic clich\u00e9s. However, those clich\u00e9s are far from the main focus, as they are only a means of paving the way for a greater story to unfold. But what is by far the best thing in this movie is not the way the story wraps up, but rather how well the acting in this movie makes everything totally plausible. \n\nSadly though, this is one hell of an overlooked movie, and one of the greatest movies ever made of its genre. Forget about Twilight and True Blood. Those are merely cheap escapism for women dreaming of a handsome boyfriend of an occult nature, whilst Let The Right One In rather tells how a boy falls for a girl without knowing who she truly is. \n\nI don't think there is any more I can say about this film. It is emotional, suspenseful, powerful and all around a phenomenal movie.",

Oskar is a young boy who can't seem to shake off the local bullies, but all of that begins to change when a new neighbor moves in next door. After striking up an innocent friendship with his eccentric next-door neighbor, Oskar realizes that she is the vampire responsible for the recent rash of deaths around town. Despite the danger, however, Oskar's friendship with the girl ultimately takes precedence over his fear of her.\nMy Review\nI like the remake a little bit more than this heartwarming and frightning original swedish version of Let me in. In this review i shall tell why of course. In the remake they did something realistic which is have a cop investigate and try to figure out about all the murders in the small town. whereas of this swedish version they just have this one guy who see's the girl attacking a friend of his and trys to find out why and how she did that. The remake is also a little more scary when it comes to the kills commited by the little vampire girl. The acting is done great by the swedish actors espically Lina Leanderrson as Eli. This is still a great horror film that i highly recommend.",

It's a cheesy joke, I know, but I just couldn't help myself, and besides it was either that or a reference to \"Let the Right One In\", and you don't know cheesy until you evoke Morrissey, one of the innovators of indie music. At any rate, if I'm going to be referencing any modern rock song, especially in a discussion about a Swedish film, chances are that it's by The Flower Kings, but I don't even know if they fit here, because as this film most definitely will most definitely you, Roine Stolt is probably the only modern Swedish artist whose efforts are upbeat, or rather, not deeply disturbing to some extent. I was going to try and figure out some way to deem this \"Twilight\" for kids or something, but as if \"Twilight\" didn't seem neutered enough for you, man, the pre-teen children in this film get themselves mixed up in some messed up shenanigans. Only in Stockholm can stuff like this happen, or at least in a suburb named Blackeberg, which sounds either foreboding, - what with the \"black\" in its name and whatnot - or, well, a black Jew. Oh, shoot, now we've Jewish Blackulas to deal, so I guess that effectively contradicts the idea that Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz is too perfect to be in \"Carrie\", because there's no getting pig blood on that girl, unless, of course, she gets the pork rinds out of. Man, that statement is all kinds of ignorant, and not just to Jews and blacks, but because I'm recognizing Lina Leandersson's role in this film through Moretz's portrayal of it in my native language of Americanese, rather than appreciating the original work of art, regardless of the language barriers and blah-blah-blah. Hey, jerks, even The Flower Kings had to realize that they were going to be low-profile enough without singing in English, though that might just be because their lyrics are hard enough to understand in English (\"I may be a stray dog, mama, but my mind is as clear as ever; I'm as free as a... fish!\"... Vad? Jag visste att jag skulle jobba i en Flower Kings lyrisk referens n\u00e5gonstans h\u00e4r), because Swedish stuff is still worth checking out if you have to have subtitles handy, as this film will tell you... I think (The subtitles might not be completely accurate), but not without making plenty of moves that distance you about as much as the subtitles.\r\n\r\nOkay, now, first off, considerable shortcomings in this film can be found within its concept alone, because there's a certain thinness to the weight and scope of this drama that limits potential, and it doesn't help that this story concept also has some glaringly questionable elements to the characters we apparently need to be highly invested in, and even gets to be a touch histrionic at times. The foundation upon which this drama is built is sturdy enough for plenty of potential to stand its ground just fine I suppose, but it's still pretty shaky, so in order for this film to really soak up potential compellingness, it needs to keep things pumping, rather than drag its feet as much as this film does. This film goes a very artistic route when it comes to setting up mood, and that means that it takes way too much time meditating upon nothing but nothing, until it finds itself meandering along and dragging down momentum, occasionally into aimlessness, which would be easier to excuse if this film's storytelling wasn't as atmospherically limp as it is structurally limp. Director Tomas Alfredson relies a lot on quietness and sober intensity to drive the tension that in turn drives this art thriller, and such a method often works, but when it doesn't, oh boy, it does anything but engage, drying out the atmosphere until things start to bland up substantially, then continue on until, before you know it, it's dulling things down. I'm not going to lie, the film is boring in a lot of places, and beyond natural shortcomings, that is its biggest problem, because when the chilled momentum isn't completely disengaging you, it's all but placing pacing at a stand-still, and therefore giving you too much time to meditate upon the natural shortcomings, which are emphasized just as much by, of all things, too much atmospheric spirit. When the air in this film isn't dry, it's coated with a sense of overambition that Alfredson probably shouldn't be having, because potential is limited, and the artistic touches that Alfredson work in don't always work, and a film with a formula like that is doomed to collapse into underwhelmingness. This is that kind of film, and yet, while the final product is indeed underwhelming, glimpses into what could have been break up a consistency in some degree of engagement value, or at least consistency in a considerable degree of artistic value.\r\n\r\nLike I said, this is a very quiet film, so Johan S\u00f6derqvist's score is pretty rarely played up, but when it does finally arise, it's actually quite worthy of the patience, having a breathtakingly tasteful minimalism and airiness to it whose subtle grace is both beautiful by its own right and complimentary to the tonal dynamicity of this drama. When the film is tense, S\u00f6derqvist's efforts are haunting, and when the film is more tender, S\u00f6derqvist breathes life into resonance that should be more recurring throughout the final product, but either way, the musical artistry of the film is impressive, much like the visual artistry, as Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography has a certain cold color to it that is often kind of flat, but just as often draws the darker elements of the visuals with a striking ruggedness, as well as the crisper moments quite warmly. Juggling sparse lighting that all but stuns when it livens up, this film's visual style is pretty neo-gothic, as is S\u00f6derqvist's score, so from an artistic style standpoint, this effort pretty much excels, thus making problematic substance the key culprit behind the undercutting of potential that, make no mistake, is, in fact, there. This film's story concept is a bit too minimalist for its own good, and the overly arty, and therefore overly steady interpretation of such a compliment doesn't exactly make compellingness any firmer, but this is still a pretty promising tale that carries rather unique and layered elements, brought to life by genuine highlights in the effectiveness of Tomas Alfredson's very sparse storytelling, which blands things up quite a bit, to be sure, but about as often successfully establishes a chilling atmosphere that stresses the sting of the disturbances, and sometimes even establishes a more heartfelt atmosphere that stresses resonance. This drama is kind of moving at times, and when it's not, well, it's kind of boring, but then it will tense up a bit and keep you going, and while that little system that Alfredson sets up isn't going to craft a truly rewarding final product, it gets you by, but not without the help of the onscreen talent, particularly the newcoming talents. Most everyone is decent in this film, but really, of all people, it's the very young leads who really keep things about as alive as it can be with underwriting, as they share fine chemistry and impress by their own individual rights, with K\u00e5re Hedebrant being thoroughly convincing as a creepy youngster who finds the monotony in his life broken by extraordinary and dangerous situations, while Lina Leandersson proves to be effective as a violent, but guilty creature, disguised a simply quiet person. Sure, the quietness of our leads' performances reflect a certain laziness in character writing that holds the young talents back, but when material comes, Hedebrant and Leandersson deliver, as surely as Alfredson delivers as director when he finds the opportunity, and such performances aren't enough to make all that rewarding of a film, but they certainly go into crafting a decent film, just one that could have been more.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, thin subject matter weight, questionably drawn characters and some histrionics reflect natural shortcomings that go emphasized enough by limp dragging, dulling atmospheric coldness and overambition for the final product to fall as pretty underwhelming, but still stand as decent on the backs of strong score work, lovely cinematography, highlights in a unique, if dramatically limited story concept, effective moments within Tomas Alfredson's gothic atmosphere, and strong performances by K\u00e5re Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson that secure \"Let the Right One In\" as a decent and often effective dramatic thriller, even if it is all too often loose with its take on the term [u]thrill[/u]er.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

Kare Hedebrant who plays Oskar is mesmerising; a gentle, innocent, 'different' child, as white as the perpetual snow that covers the landscape throughout this movie.  Wild horses wouldn't normally drag me to watch a 'vampire movie' and yet the vampire theme in LTROI is almost peripheral to the central themes of loneliness, isolation, bullying and the gentle (well, sometimes brutal) unfolding of first love.  The adult characters, although numerous, often belligerent or sometimes just plain bizarre,  fade like shadows into the background, so strong is the presence of Oskar, Eli (played by Linda Leandersson), and their brutish peers.  Like a well written book, there is little self pity shown by Oskar and Eli, despite their often being neglected, ignored, or bullied; they simply 'survive' in their harshly lonely world and gravitate towards each other, outcasts both.  The only thing that I feel slightly mars the intelligent sensitivity of LTROI, is one too many dismembered body parts; we got it the first time and the second time and after that became overkill (no pun intended) and somewhat spoilt an otherwise beautifully conceived film.  Overall, however, I found LTROI to be a haunting juxtaposition of fear and hope - Nordic bleakness with an uplifting twist and for those reasons I thoroughly recommend it.",

            "content": "A very warm welcome to 'Let the Right One In', a film about a teenage vampire in love with a normal human. Sound familiar? Well, let me assure you that 'Let the Right One In' was written first, and it tells a more emotionally stirring and creatively compelling story than the retardedness that is 'Twilight'.\r\n\r\nOskar(Kare Hedebrant) is a young boy who enjoys cars, playing in the snow, and newspaper articles about disturbing murders, among other things. One night, while trying to piece together his Rubik's cube, he meets his new neighbor, Eli(Lina Leandersson), a young and mysterious girl. When she asks to borrow his Rubik's cube, he finds it the next day hidden in the snow, each side a solid color. He starts to notice strange things about her: A - she never comes out in the day B - she never eats C - she exudes a low growl whenever she sees blood D - she can't enter someone else's home without their spoken permission. Well, after some ghastly deaths, Oskar asks her: \"Are you a vampire?\" to which she replies, \"Yes.\" Next question: \"Are you dead?\" to which she replies, \"No. Can't you tell?\" Hmmm, that's new.\r\n\r\nLet's look at the difference between that change in vamirism, and 'Twilight's' version of vampirism. In 'Twilight', vampire traditions are changed for no other purpose than the fact that the plot demands it. Vampires have to be able to walk around during the day because Edward and his family, for no good reason at all, have to go to school. Why do they have to go to school? So that Edward can meet Bella. It's designed around the plot. If there's a plot point that's inconsistent, the rules have to drastically change with no other purpose than, \"The Plot Demands It.\" Edward doesn't have to go to High School. Why would he enroll in High School and pay tuition to learn something he already knows? The usual excuse is so people won't think they're some strange hermit family. Well, people already think they're strange because of their pasty white skin and largely noticable eye liner. I know several teenagers who don't go to school. It's called home-schooling. But, no. Bella and Edward have to meet, the plot demands that, therefore Edward has to go to school, therefore vampires have to be able to walk around during the day.\r\n\r\nNow, let's look at the change in vampirism rules made in this instance: When Oskar asks, \"Are you dead?\" Eli replies, \"No. Can't you tell?\" There is no plot point that needs to be covered up by that change in the rules. They changed that rule out of a creative character design. It's a symbolic representation of the love she feels for Oskar. Perhaps, even, she didn't mean it literally. More importantly than the actual reason for that piece of dialogue, however, is the fact that it makes you think about the reason for that piece of dialogue, something 'Twilight' never does.\r\n\r\nThis movie is psychologically stimulating. For instance: Is it a crime to kill someone if you have to? What if, incontrollably, you kill someone that you dislike or wanted dead in the first place? How would you react to killing that person? Eli believes that she is being humane by killing her victims before the venom causes them to become like her. Oskar doesn't know what to think. At first, he doesn't mind. Then, however, she sees her kill someone and becomes horribly frightened. However, by the end of the film, he has to choose whether to stay in school as the nerdy boy who gets beat up by the sadistic bully, or to run away with Eli.\r\n\r\nAnother difference to 'Twilight' is the fact that this film actually knows what subtlety is. I'm pretty sure that Edward and Bella tell each other, \"I love you.\" at least six times through out the film, and it's in the most conventional way possible: \"I love you, but I don't wanna hurt you.\" In 'Let the Right One In', the one and only time that Oskar and Eli tell each other they love another is at the very end of the movie, and it's in Morse Code. It's a sweeter, more vibrant, and more emotionally connected form of expression.\r\n\r\nThere are faults in this film, including two highly cheesy effects sequences; one is of a woman catching on fire, and another is of a group of cats attacking a vampire. Both these scenes were incredibly laughable, however the rest of the film is a triumph and a wonder, and if they're smart, they'll drop the 'Twilight' sequels, and make some more movies like this.",

I will say this beacause this one was well done it didn't really need a remake only 2 years later and that it is a shame that it most likely was remade because American audiences don't want to read subtitles. I did not think the \"when cats attack\" part was that great though, it looked silly and was glad they took that part out of the new one.",
