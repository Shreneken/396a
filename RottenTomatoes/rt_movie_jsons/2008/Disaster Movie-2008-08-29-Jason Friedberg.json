The best thing about it was the memes, with users poking fun at the whole thing, This film was dreadful, but I liked it because it was so much like so many of the other films in my genre.\n\nIt was probably not even bad, it's just so close to the ones I love.",

It doesn't help that the \"plot\" barely fits the criteria for a disaster movie spoof, whereas Epic Movie at least had Narnia as the main focus through and through. The few jokes that did made me laugh didn't having me fully giggling, so you still get the worst star rating a movie can get on this site.

            "content": "Disaster movie starts with a shit joke, a joke about a movie where the reference wasn't relevant a year after its release, a crappy joke about a now dead celebrity, then a really long burp joke, then the main character wakes up from a dream, but you've only begun the nightmare. Yep, it's one of those movies. The first time I saw disaster movie I actually didn't think it was bad, but that was because I was roughly ten. Then I watched it again, and realized it was terrible. And with all the movies I've been reviewing, nothing has gone below a five, so I thought I'd just break a little history by reviewing my worst movie yet. That being said Disaster movie has tiny, tiny moments. It'll make you chuckle, but cringe from the stupidity shortly after. And I don't care if the second half was pure comedic gold, nothing can redeem the first thirty minutes of this movie. I don't know why these parody movies continue to only paradise good films, but it's even worse when the scale between those movies and this is so far. Every film in this movie, even the Love Guru and fucking High School Musical are better than this. And at least movies like Epic movie or the scary movies are mediocre to surprisingly good films, but this is just crap, and probably the worst parody movie I've ever seen. It's not just movies, which is another huge flaw. It's parodying dozens of celebrities, movies, to just stupid things in general. None of these things make you laugh like they should. It's not making points that the movies we like are bad under a certain light that is comedical, it's mostly poor shock value, and alongside painfully bad jokes. If you do laugh it'll be over something stupid and forgettable. Seeing a random Batman talk about how he spend the whole day on Amazon or Beowulf talking how he's not gay because he's business partners with his friend Paul in an antique shop. As far as the acting goes, I can't really say. It's like trying to examine a picture while it's covered in shit. The writing is so bad nobody could do it well, so how could I possibly critique what couldn't be done right? Yeah, it's bad, but the script I honestly believe could have been written better by a third grader. And another thing, this movie goes to random. By the second half your used to really immature style, and by then the movie is dead, but at least your used to it. But you could be watching a normal scene, then a character from a movie you may or may not have seen (there's so many movies, if your not a avid movie devotee, you won't understand a least a fifth of the dialogue) will pop up, say something stupid, will make you cringe, will then die by shock value, and as it fails the scene will move back. I imagine this movie probably was rushed, or something really bad happened, but seriously, this is inexcusable. With parody movies, they make fun of themselves, the movie, and in the end just take a serious scene and twist it into something to chuckle at. Some characters are meant to be exaggerated versions of the other characters, and some remain somewhat serious. With this, everyone is bat shit crazy, there's seemingly never ending poop jokes and people dying randomly and violently, and your just reminded of what better movies you could be watching. Not to mention main characters come and go at any moment, like they wanted more shock value deaths and stupidity added into it. If I had to say there was one good moment, it was the princess from enchanted. She actually parodied her character, and although did stupid shit, didn't annoy me, and made me chuckle at her voice and some lines that probably weren't even in the script. The most ironic thing is the title, it describes the whole movie. And I hate to use the word \"stupid,\" in an argument, as it generally makes whoever said it look unintelligent themselves. But this movie is just blain stupid, no other way around it. The only people I could see liking it are kids, (hence the reason I liked it the first watch, but children shouldn't grow up with shitty movies like this, so don't let them watch this,) and the unintelligent. Not saying someone out there couldn't completely turn their brain off, let a bunch of dumb jokes go, and still find the movie kind of okay, but I don't think anyone can argue when taking the movie seriously that it is bad. Next to Vampires Suck, this is the worst of the worst. Parody movies I feel can be done well, if executed correctly. I could easily sit back and chuckle at some dumb lines from the scary movie series, or even Epic movie. If I reviewed those I'm sure they wouldn't rank up that bad, but those I feel had actual intelligence behind it, while also giving something for the immature kids who'll see the movie. This, nothing. Sure, you'll laugh at some parts, but cringe soon after. Laugh at the stupid stunt double being shown (cause that's not been done by every other parody movie) just know you'll probably be sighing in stupidity moments later. This is the logic of the movie. The guy wakes up with Flavor Flav who just banged his wife, he leaves, you find out she's stingy because apparently they broke up, then she asks him if he wants to take it to the next level. What? That's not funny, it wasn't even a joke, it's just there to be stupid! There I said the word stupid again, but this movie will make an entire audience idiots by just sucking you into this bullshit movie where a bunch of half naked chicks run on screen, one claims she shit herself, then run off screen. Anyway, huge thumbs down for this movie.",

This movie is NOT supposed to be stupid, ridiculous and silly. This movie is a parody movie, meaning that it's supposed to be funny, and words can't describe how unfunny it is. I saw some reviews that say, \"If you saw this movie in the theater, expecting something other than something ridiculous, than you're going to hate it.\" Well, guess what? If I was expecting to see a stupid movie in the theaters, you know what I would do? NOT WASTE MY TIME WATCHING THE MOVIE.

The film is a massive collage of movies put together to try to create something funny; putting recognizable characters on screen and saying, \"Look, there's [this character]. He/She has had a recent film which is relevant to today's youth and pop culture.\" The result fails.\r\n \r\nDisaster Movie begins with the dream of the main character, Will, played by Matt \"The Clone Wars\" Lanter. In his dream, it is told that the world will end on August 29th, 2008 (ironically, the film's release date). \r\n\r\nDuring Will's Sweet Sixteen party, a bulletin comes out that it is indeed the end of the world. Now Will and his friend's Calvin, Juney (Juno), Lisa (played by Razzie nominated Kim Kardashian) and the Enchanted Princess (from Enchanted) have to fight their way through reference after reference to save Will's cheating ex-girlfriend Amy and possible save the world. Why he still cares for her is beyond me. \r\n\r\nThe characters are way beyond dull, there are absolutely unmemorable. I can barely remember their names. The one characters who stands out would be the Enchanted Princess, who alternates between quirky, annoying, sometimes funny, badass and just plain weird. \r\n\r\nThe script doesn't seem to care about the films its referencing. Not parodying, referencing. The storyline is only made in order to show these second-hand copies of popular movie characters. In fact, some of the films mentioned in the movie themselves aren't good or memorable. How can this film stand the test of time when it makes references that are outdated even six years later? The answer is it doesn't. \r\n\r\nThe film also takes an almost mean-spirited ribbing of the movies and even celebrities. In other parody films, for example Young Frankenstein, the work being looked at and parodied is given the utmost respect upon the transfer to the screen. In films like this and even Airplane!, the comedy is almost all original and comes from witty dialog, background jokes and outlandish scenes. This film does none of that. Instead, it says, \"Here's Batman. He's not acting like Batman. He has a pratfall. Laugh.\"\r\n\r\nWith all that said, this unfunny mess of the movie mash-up gets my vote for one of the worst movies of all time. All I can say is that the film makers of this film, who also released other films such as Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans and Vampires Suck, need to take a lesson out of the book of Mel Brooks. \r\n\r\nAnd for those out there who have just watched this, go watch Spaceballs. Not the greatest but you'll enjoy it a whole lot better. \r\n\r\n1/2 out of ****\r\n\r\n(I should also note that the Princess does have the best line of the movie; \"You know, they say that the first kill is supposed to be difficult. But I find it easy. In fact, rather fun.\" This line, to me, may be the only worth watching thing in the movie.)",

Other than that, they've produced some of the worst films I've ever had to experience. So, I had no expectations for this so-called film and rightly so. The gags are god awful, the jokes are god awful, everything associated with this film is god awful. I couldn't even smirk during this shit fest. This might just be one of the worst films I've ever seen and trust me I've some of the worst out there. What I'm pretty much saying is: avoid this horrible film! This is a real disaster. 0/5",

But a terrible - utterly terrible - script made sure nothing funny came out of that film.

There's no excuse for the greedy, self indulging, laziness that the filmmakers here have compiled. Let me take a few moments to name them.\r\n\r\nIf I ever find Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzer, the 'directors' of this so called film, I will kill them. So many good filmmakers are struggling to get on their feet and make their movies, and Friedberg and Seltzer are making trash and have no problem. They are also the writers of the so called 'movie' and are indeed members of the WGA. They should have their membership revoked for tainting the spirit and dignity of writers everywhere.\r\n\r\nOf course, they also produced the film, and here's a list of other producers that I wag my finger at: Jerry P. Jacobs, Peter Safran, and Kenny Yates. Shame on you for going out and actually doing business with people in order to get the film made, edited, and distributed. Shame on you.\r\n\r\n'Original' music by Christopher Lennertz, Cinematography by Shawn Maurer, Editing by Peck Prior, Casting by Tara Duncil, the list goes on and on and on, right to the payroll accountant.\r\n\r\nBut worst of all, the people who actually gave their money to these filmmakers, who do not actually have a credit in the film (I'm supposing they didn't want their name to be associated with it), whoever invested and executive produced this film, you are the lowest of scum. You are the epitome of bad taste, and indignity. I hope, for your sake, that I never meet you.\r\n\r\nTo the readers: Don't see this movie. Do NOT support this movie in any way, shape, or form. Do NOT give money to this movie. After all, they keep making more because people keep seeing them. On flixser, the percent of people who claimed they would not see the movie was 70%, the people who claimed they would see the movie was 30%. That 30% is too high. Please, stop bad filmmaking. It's the public's fault. Don't see the movie, I beg you.",
