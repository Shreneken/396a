    "summary": "Chloe (Drew Barrymore), a pampered Chihuahua from Beverly Hills, gets an unwelcome taste of the real world when she gets lost in a tough part of Mexico. With no Rodeo Drive boutiques in sight, she is out of her element, until scrappy street dogs Delgado and Papi lend her a paw, helping her find her way home.",

            "content": "The definition of average. The characters are generic and forgettable. The dogs are ok at best and not that good at worst. The CGI'd mouths just don't match the emotions the dogs are supposed to be feeling. None of the jokes are bad really but none of them really worked either they all just fell flat. The cinematography in this is surprisingly good. Everything is well lit, with pretty to look at settings but I wouldn't call any of it memorable. The camerawork is solid also with well framed shots. The music is ok with dated pop songs even for 2008 and 00's pop mix along with generic scores. The editing and pacing is passable. This isn't a long film and it doesn't really have a bad story but more stupid if that makes sense than anything. Honestly its so generic just skip it.",

Con personajes muy estereotipados, los mismos se vuelven aburridos y chocantes en pocos minutos. Y aunque la historia sea muy irreal cumple con su misión de entretener, ya sea por los sets (que son muy interesantes) hasta como los personajes intentan en como cabe en el guion \"evolucionar\". Aunque te logras encariñar por los protagonistas, la trama no los ayuda a ser recordables, ya que la misma se encarga en entorpecerlos haciendo creer que desde el guion literario ya pensaban en la trilogía. Una trilogía que no aporta nada nuevo ni nada interesante que ver o que sea \"único\" de este universo. Una película para ver en familia pero que no se va a volver una cinta que pase por tu mente una vez que la hayas terminado de ver.",

Obviously, this movie is not meant to be a deep dive into the feelings of a dog from a rich neighborhood, but a fun family comedy/adventure film. In that respect it does a decent job providing some entertainment. The acting is mediocre as is the voice acting for the animals. There is a negative viewpoint of Mexico that is hard to ignore for those who know better. Some of the CGI of the animals is not impressive, though most of the movie uses practical effects and lip overs for the animals. Some of the plot points are too over the top for me. If you are a dog person or are in the mood for a mindless family comedy then check this movie out.",

Sure, there's good voice acting and there are moments where you can tell that the animal trainers were taking the job more seriously than the screenwriters or Raja Gosnell did but this doesn't stand out amongst other forgettable family comedies. From a cookie-cutter story to flat gags to good old \"soundtrack that will most definitely not become outdated in a few years' time\", this movie is so forgettable that apparently, it's not even on Disney+. Ouch. But hey, very little kids will be distracted by it, I guess :/",
