    "summary": "In 1928 Los Angeles, single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) arrives home to find her son, Walter, gone. Five months later her prayers are answered when Walter is found in Illinois. But to Christine's horror, the boy who steps off the train is not her son. Authorities vehemently dispute Christine's claim, and her one ally is a clergyman (John Malkovich) who sees the case as his chance to expose corruption in the Los Angeles Police Department and government.",

Angelina Jolie gives a superb performance in the lead role, in a plot that is rather harrowing whilst also being actually incredibly infuriating - as in, the film does a great job at making the antagonists the antagonists.\n\nThe cast, spearheaded by Jolie, are excellent. No-one is on her level per se, but there are very good performances from the likes of John Malkovich, Michael Kelly, Jeffrey Donovan and Geoff Pierson; kid actor Eddie Alderson also impresses.\n\nI will say that the story wraps up in a quicker manner than I thought it would, though the pacing of the 142 minute run time is in fact one of its positives - even at that length, I feel it could've drawn out the court trial stuff longer; though that may have hindered the pacing, so it's not really a noteworthy criticism of mine at all.\n\nOne worth recommending, no doubt!",

Por otro lado, Angelina Jolie hizo un buen trabajo interpretando el papel principal y todas las demás actuaciones también están muy bien. Me gustó mucho la película principalmente por las emociones que genera mientras la ves. Entramos en esta historia, absorbemos la atmósfera de aquellos tiempos, sus secretos y te pone en el lugar de la protagonista sintiendo lo mismo que ella en cada momento. En conclusión, una historia real triste y sorprendente que es muy buena en muchos aspectos pero que dura mas de lo debido. Sin embargo, no hay dudas en que la recomiendo.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's _Changeling_ is truly a horror movie, but not one with monsters or zombies. The horror is that it actually happened. Of course, there are some embellishments and slight inaccuracies, but they're minor. \nIn 1928 Los Angeles, single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), a supervisor for the telephone company, is called in to work on a Saturday. She leaves her son Walter in front of the radio. She makes him some lunch and puts it in the fridge (actually, they were called iceboxes in the 1920's). She asks a neighbor to check in on him. When she returns home, Walter is gone. The cops are little help initially, but they eventually agree to investigate. They find the kid five months later in Illinois. They bring him back to L.A. to reunite with his mother and make sure the press is there to document what a great job they have done--since most of the press about the L.A. cops has to do with incompetence, corruption, and cover-ups.\nProblem is, he's not her son. But nobody believes her. Incredibly, she is eventually diagnosed as delusional and put into a mental hospital.\nThis movie challenged my credulity big time. I keep thinking that the film exaggerated the real story. This couldn't possibly have happened. But doing some research, I discovered that Eastwood rigorously stuck with the facts from court transcripts and police documents. \nI'll admit right up front that I don't like big  movie stars. I wish Eastwood had chosen someone other than Jolie, who is just too damn good looking to be realistic. But the box office rules, and Jolie does turn in a convincing performance. So does John Malkovich as a civic minded, rebellious preacher who is on a mission to expose the nasty deeds of the L.A police force. The other actors, including Jeffrey Donovan as  the crooked police captain, are also excellent. But it's the story that rules this film. There are further developments which add to the ever-increasing horror.\nThere's clearly a feminist polemic here concerning women's treatment by men in authority, as well as a diatribe about the Powers That Be---not just the cops, but the doctors and mental health people, all complicit in taking the cops' word against that of a mother.\nThe ending........Well, no spoilers. But it's pretty heavy.\nEastwood has directed many great films. Some critics say that this one doesn't measure up to his best work. I disagree. It's long (2 1/2 hours), and it's emotionally draining, but it skillfully recounts a sad, amazing story",

I liked the film very much mainly because of the emotions it aroused while watching. We enter this history, we absorb the atmosphere of those times - its secrets. The figure of the killer was also intriguing. He was probably a man not so much angry as having problems with himself.",

            "content": "Familiar and yet Changeling still rivets you.\n\nClint Eastwood's crime mystery and period drama Changeling (2008) feels like Eastwood trying to recreate his directorial magic from Mystic River with influences of David Fincher's Zodiac and Roman Polanski's Chinatown mixed in here. Changeling is certainly engaging as a film and well made. I just feel like Eastwood has directed even better throughout his illustrious career. Changeling is a fantastic crime mystery that reaches heights like Zodiac, but never reaches devastating realism in its drama like Eastwood's early classic Mystic River that Changeling bears more than a few resemblances to in hindsight.\n\nIt's nice that Eastwood tried to direct a feminist film, sympathetic to the plight of a woman who needed to be believed by the men around her, but this is laughable coming from a lifelong sexist, conservative like the notorious Clint Eastwood. Ridiculous sexist concepts that only could have been conjured by Clint seep through Changeling like the young, single Angelina Jolie's only potential dating prospect at the end being an older balding white man with a position of power over her. If only Eastwood had more women's voices and perspective involved while creating Changeling, this would feel more empathetic and sincere. \n\nIt's an infuriating true story that uncovers corruption, cruelty, criminality, and sexism from The LAPD and American justice systems in general. However, this is a strange subject for Eastwood, whose early films objectify women endlessly and who personally supports conservative police policies. So I cannot help but feel like Eastwood is disingenuous for directing Changeling, who I doubt actually felt deep sympathy for the female and child victims herein. It's hard to see kindness from Clint Eastwood. I'm glad he told this outrageous piece of history, but I feel like a woman director and writer would have elevated this material to something more polished and poignant. \n\nJ. Michael Straczynski's script is well written with heartfelt passages that strike you with emotional realism. Other parts have lame and predictable dialogue, especially everything the cops say throughout Changeling that feel like a television show. Joel Cox and Gary D. Roach's editing is sleek and polished with no flaws I can really see other than they could have cut a few minutes more to ensure Changeling's 141 minutes does not drag. Tom Stern's cinematography is so stunning for all the close-ups and medium shots to allow you to simply witness excellence in character acting. His shot choices ensure performances are as gripping as possible.\n\nJames J. Murakami's production design really looks like 1928 America. Same with Deborah Hopper's stylish fashions for Changeling's costumes and Zoe Hay's plush make-up. Clint Eastwood's score is beautiful with memorable and subtle piano melodies all over Changeling. It's lovely to hear Clint express his artistry to the music in his movies as well as directing them.\n\nAngelina Jolie is powerful and commanding in a vulnerable lead actress role as Christine Collins, the brave mother of a missing son. Her sincere acting has a striking aura and fearsome gravitas that you really feel the realism of her character. Amy Ryan should have got an award for her supporting actress role as the unjustly incarcerated Carol Dexter. She is arguably the best actress in the movie. That's really saying something considering how captivating Jolie's leading part remains in Changeling.\n\nJohn Malkovich is excellent as the sympathetic and helpful reverend who aids Angelina Jolie's quest for justice and answers. Jeffrey Donovan way overacts as the old timey cop captain, who feels cartoonish at best. His accent and voice choices were certainly a choice. Michael Kelly is fierce as the rough cop detective searching for missing kids. Jason Butler Harner is creepy and outstanding as the serial killer. His chilling performance is the special kind of character acting you only get in an Eastwood great film. I pretty much hated everyone else in this one aside from all the wonderful performances from the child actors, especially the killer's little helper elf's confession.\n\nIn conclusion, Changeling mostly holds up as a tender and authentic picture of classy sophistication and frightening realism from an old school director like Clint Eastwood.",

It's been impressive to see him make the leap from comic books to books, television, movies, etc. I see Neil Gaiman following very quickly in his footsteps. That being said, I was quite surprised to see JMS migrate out of his sci-fi genre into a historical film about a very odd criminal case from the late 1920's, more commonly referred to as the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders. Years ago, a contact with Los Angeles County called JMS and told him that the county was about to go through a house cleaning and destroy some documents on a strange case in which JMS might be interested. Those documents, after years of development, resulted in Clint Eastwood's Changeling. While being an interesting niche story about a single, working woman in the late 1920s who, out of need, must leave her son home alone every day while she works. One day she comes home to find her son missing. After weeks of no progress by the oft-criticized, corrupt LAPD, she gets a call saying that her son has been found. Once reunited with her son, she realizes that this child is not hers. Only the LAPD, needing to save face, make her think she's crazy for thinking he isn't her child. The story then follows two different paths that eventually converge. One is the fight Angeline Jolie, who plays the mom, Christine Collins, endures with the LAPD, and all of the unethical and illegal actions taken against her as she tries to prove the LAPD has not found her child. The other is about the true perpitrators of the crime and the activities happening in the chicken coops in Wineville, CA. Angelina's performance is very good, if not, at times, overdramatic, which doesn't seem all that unusual given the subject matter and her role in it. However, what absolutely kills this movie is the directing. Like I've said recently, I just don't understand Hollywood. When is someone going to tell Clint Eastwood that he is a piss poor director?? I read an interview with JMS, who said that he wrote one major draft of this movie. And the only element he had to change was an incorrect reference about Scrabble, which this movie pre-dates by a couple of years. Other than that, he asked Eastwood about rewrites. Clint's response? No...the draft is fine as it is. Let's just shoot the draft. I'm convinced this is how he operates all the time. Now, admittedly, I have not seen Million Dollar Baby. And I've been told I would think differently if I saw it. And I did like Flags of our Fathers and I love High Plains Drifter. However, the list of bad, overrated Clint Eastwood films can wallpaper my bedroom. Mystic River? Space Cowboys? Bridges of Madison County? Unforgiven? Pale Rider? Firefox? Bronco Billy? My God...all horrible movies. The common theme in all of these films, however, is slow, painful pacing. Now, it worked in High Plains Drifter. Very well. In fact, the pacing is probably very good for most Westerns, even though Unforgiven and Pale Rider are two of the worst Westerns I've ever seen. In any case, his slow, drawn-out pacing in his movies can only be appropriate if the story lends itself to that pacing. Unfortunately, most of them don't. Changeling is no different. The subject matter is clearly very interesting. The actors perform very well, including an underrated performance by Jason Butler Harner as the main criminal, Gordon Northcott. Cinematically, the scenes are beautiful as well, with an almost black-and-white feel, even though it's in color. The problem is the pacing. Eastwood should have rewritten several scenes. Some were unnecessarily long. Some were unnecessary period. The movie was way longer than it needed to be and felt every minute as long. It should have been restructured as well as there were numerous times that the story felt as though it were ending, but then it wouldn't. There was a point at the very end when the Eastwood explains in succinct, printed words a short epilogue of what happens to the characters years later. What I couldn't help but think, especially after finding out that there were several pieces of history left out of the epilogue, as well as the movie itself, is that the movie could have ended about 45 minutes early and most of the later scenes summarized in the same epilogue. It's almost as though Clint's slow, soft-spoken demeanor is related to the pace at which he thinks, and therefore shows up in his slowly-paced films. The story is an interesting one though, but I would definitely recommend supplementing the mediocre film with additional research on the Internet.",

            "content": "In 1928, 9 year old Walter Collins disappeared.  His disappearance created a lot of bad publicity for the Los Angeles police who were suffering in the press for a host of corruption issues.  Anxious to make the case go away, they leaped on a runaway boy found in Illinois who claimed to be Walter Collins under questioning.  They brought him to Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), who immediately denied that this was her son.  Police Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) browbeat her into \"trying him out for a few days\".  Of course this was not Walter Collins, and as the evidence mounted, Christine Collins returned to the police with a ton of physical evidence, only to find herself committed to a mental hospital for being difficult.  Clint Eastwood sculpts a decent, workmanlike film that gets a lot of mileage out of the infuriating outrage that this incident generates in any viewer and from good performances from a cast that also includes John Malkovich, Amy Ryan and Colm Feore.  It's a tad too long, dealing with additional subplots that seem eminently droppable.  The film was originally set to be directed by Ron Howard, which I think provides a perfect illustration of what the film's like.",

            "content": "With great performances, elaborate writing, phenomenal costuming and set pieces, and some classic direction, CHANGELING is a feast of a period piece.  Clint Eastwood gets everything into this tight direction.  Angelina Jolie appears perfectly suited to play a victim of the sanitoriums of the roarin' '20's and her performance as a devastated mother makes her appear suited for motherhood and capable of caring for six children of her own.  I mean, this was before her six children I think, but anyway I was convinced.  John Malkovich seems oddly placed as a religious leader until he begins speaking on his pulpit against corruption, and later as a supporter of Collin's defense.  Jefferey Donovon's sleazy police captain is both hard-boiled as a performance and vile as a character.  J.M. Straczynski's plotting is elaborate.  Corruption, abusive authority, poor objective scientific application, manipulating truth, and sexism are all social norms in the Los Angeles town in the roaring '20's.  In this film, the authority figures seem to have dehumanized themselves in favor of a well-oiled mechanistic society and with their abusive manipulation of public opinion.  Anyone with power is hard and obtuse to anyone else's difficulties, while humane treatment and empathy are simply absent to those who've built their fortresses of power and dominance.  And if that wasn't enough, true sociopathy is revealed in a serial killer whose demise is rooted in corporal punishment brought over from the Nineteenth Century.  I mean, it's well worth the watch, even if it may have a plot hole.",

            "content": "What makes \"Changeling\" such a profoundly affecting film is the fact that its shades of outrage feel real.  It is based on a true crime(s), but there are no moments of biographical movie artifice - it's so unabashedly grim one could swear that the sun is a front for the underlying wickedness of the universe.  It tells the too-awful-to-be-true story of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), a 1920s-era working mother who faces her worst nightmare when her nine-year-old son (Gattlin Griffith) vanishes into thin air after she covers a late-night shift.\n\tEmotionally stunted and empty, she does everything she can to eventually hold him in her arms once again - and after months of relentless searching, the police find him in middle-of-nowhere Illinois.  One problem: it isn't her son.  This boy is three inches shorter, pudgier around the face, and is circumcised.  His teacher and dentist can vouch for her.  But the LAPD, being the corrupt beating heart of the city, insists it is.  The best medical professionals identified him themselves, they say as if a mother knowing what her son looks and sounds like is a completely absurd notion.  Christine simply wants her son back - and so she continues fighting for him, despite a mind-boggling police ordered mental hospital lockup.\n\tIt's clear that the LAPD knows the kid isn't hers, but, being the fraudulent public service it is, continues to stay stubborn with the objective of attempting to fix their tarnished reputation.  So imagine their panic when one of the few and far between good detectives, Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly), takes the word of a confessor and discovers the bodies of several young boys in Wineville, CA, a crime scene that could be related to the disappearance.\n\t\"Changeling\" is long at 141 minutes, but its ability to turn juicier and juicier at every turn makes it compulsively watchable, sometimes slow but never unrewarding.  Some critics have shunned its fascinating storytelling abilities due to its lack of nuance - but \"Changeling\" is a movie about story, performance, and direction; it wants to compel, and that's what it does.  Directed and scored by Clint Eastwood with one eye on metallically shaded period style and emotional subtlety, it's cold but not oppressively so.  \"Changeling\" lives in a world where the sun doesn't shine, where justice needs to be served but comes at an aggravatingly slow pace.  Eastwood sees where the story could deviate into various Lifetime movie directions and thankfully stays close to Christine Collins's story, giving needed side-plot a spotlight only when the plot really and truly needs it.  \n\tAngelina Jolie gives one of her greatest performances as a mother driven by pain but not blinded by it.  She, plain and simply, wants her son back, but doesn't lose her mind in the face of the maddening self-interest of the police.  In another film, she might have suddenly ceased to becoming a victim of circumstance and turn into a powerhouse of revenge - but Straczynski's screenplay never loses sight of the woman she was.  The closing credits assure us that Collins never stopped looking for her child; that's all she ever wanted to do, and if the LAPD hadn't been so worried about themselves, the possibility of reunion could have held potential.\n\t\"Changeling\" rides high on its outrage yet never loses sight of the Collins tragedy.  Its mission to tell a story instead of a heavily cinematic one is impressive, and the combination of Eastwood and Jolie's careful judgements make it all the more consuming.",

Changeling is merely more than adequate on all of these fronts. \n\nChristine Collins (Angelina Jolie) is a roller-skating telephone exchange supervisor in 1920's Los Angeles. After shifts, the single mother returns to her small-town home and her quietly independent nine year old son Walter (Gatlin Griffith).\n\nAfter promising Walter a day at the pictures, Christine is called to fill in a shift. Upon her return Walter is missing, as all mothers would, Christine calls the (less than helpful) Police Department for assistance. \n\nDuring a time of police brutality, corruption and laziness, Captain J.J Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) heads the police investigation to find Christine's son. After five months of no progression, bad publicity and claims of a failing system, a child (Devon Conti) surfaces across the country who claims to be Walter. \n\nCaptain Jones needing the child to help settle rumours brings him to LA in an attempt to reunite him with his relieved mother. However, standing on the platform in front of all the press, what should be a joyous moment for Christine, turns to sour when the boy produced is obviously not her son. \n\nWhen Christine unequivocally states that the child is not her son, Jones manipulates the distraught mother and states \"take him home on a trial basis, see how it goes, he has nowhere else to go\" and like any other mother, Christine accepts to take the boy.\n\nNo matter that Walter is now three inches shorter than when he left (five months prior), he does not know the basics of his life and he is now circumcised; the police and Captain Jones continue to bully Christine and try to force her into submission. \n\nChristine finally reaches a point where she can no longer tolerate and self-deceit and helped by a crusading radio evangelist, Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) she decides to make her case public.\n\nAt this point the film shifts focus, moving from every mother's greatest fear to a horrific nightmare. After Christine's tell all to the press, she is rewarded for her insubordination and is secretly whisked off into a mental hospital for a D12 admittance; a term used for women who have fallen foul of the LAPD. \n\nSurrounded by unyielding matrons and doctors with their own agendas, Christine continues to wail her stance \"I want my son back\" and for her troubles is hooked up in readiness for electric-shock treatment. \n\nAt this late stage (over an hour into the 2  1/2 hour film) a second plot line begins to emerge, offering a new explanation to the location of the Christine's true son. At the same time as Walters disappearance there was a case brought forth on one Gordon Northcott known as 'the chicken coop killer'. Although at the time there was never any solid evidence linking the two cases, this is the path the movie inevitably follows.\n\nDespite its harrowing subject matter; Changeling is utterly unmoving and fails to truly connect with viewers. Eastwood's overdone style is too classical and too restrained to get inside his characters; they feel like well-costumed under directed showroom mannequins. \n\nStrangely trying to reincarnate the success of A mighty heart, Angelina Jolie brings all her superstar-wattage to a role that commands the admiration of a benchmark piece but doesn't have the staying power. Although she is stunning and the use of colour in her lips gives a strong timeline to the film, she does fall short of expectation. \n\nThe only acting light is shed by the truly talented Malkovich. Leaving his indelible mark, shining clearly through the uncultured professionalism of his TV cop style co-stars and after school special amateur drama child actors. Whether paedophiles or crooked cops the so-called baddies were woefully bad, leaving little scope for ambiguity or suspense.\n\nThe Verdict: With a mood of stateliness bordering on the sleep-inducing leaves audiences cold even in last week's unusual heat wave. Although a solid B movie, any kind of Oscar recognition for it would be a serious mistake.\n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 13/02/2009",

            "content": "I've been a fan of J. Michael Straczynski for many years.  It's been impressive to see him make the leap from comic books to books, television, movies, etc.  I see Neil Gaiman following very quickly in his footsteps.  That being said, I was quite surprised to see JMS migrate out of his sci-fi genre into a historical film about a very odd criminal case from the late 1920's, more commonly referred to as the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders. \n\nYears ago, a contact with Los Angeles County called JMS and told him that the county was about to go through a house cleaning and destroy some documents on a strange case in which JMS might be interested.  Those documents, after years of development, resulted in Clint Eastwood's Changeling.\n\nWhile being an interesting niche story about a single, working woman in the late 1920s who, out of need, must leave her son home alone every day while she works.  One day she comes home to find her son missing.  After weeks of no progress by the oft-criticized, corrupt LAPD, she gets a call saying that her son has been found.  Once reunited with her son, she realizes that this child is not hers.  Only the LAPD, needing to save face, make her think she's crazy for thinking he isn't her child. \n\nThe story then follows two different paths that eventually converge.  One is the fight Angeline Jolie, who plays the mom, Christine Collins, endures with the LAPD, and all of the unethical and illegal actions taken against her as she tries to prove the LAPD has not found her child.  The other is about the true perpitrators of the crime and the activities happening in the chicken coops in Wineville, CA.\n\nAngelina's performance is very good, if not, at times, overdramatic, which doesn't seem all that unusual given the subject matter and her role in it.  However, what absolutely kills this movie is the directing.  Like I've said recently, I just don't understand Hollywood.  When is someone going to tell Clint Eastwood that he is a piss poor director??\n\nI read an interview with JMS, who said that he wrote one major draft of this movie.  And the only element he had to change was an incorrect reference about Scrabble, which this movie pre-dates by a couple of years.  Other than that, he asked Eastwood about rewrites.  Clint's response?  No...the draft is fine as it is.  Let's just shoot the draft.\n\nI'm convinced this is how he operates all the time.\n\nNow, admittedly, I have not seen Million Dollar Baby.  And I've been told I would think differently if I saw it.  And I did like Flags of our Fathers and I love High Plains Drifter.  However, the list of bad, overrated Clint Eastwood films can wallpaper my bedroom.\n\nMystic River?  Space Cowboys?  Bridges of Madison County?  Unforgiven?  Pale Rider?  Firefox?  Bronco Billy?  My God...all horrible movies. \n\nThe common theme in all of these films, however, is slow, painful pacing.  Now, it worked in High Plains Drifter.  Very well.  In fact, the pacing is probably very good for most Westerns, even though Unforgiven and Pale Rider are two of the worst Westerns I've ever seen.  In any case, his slow, drawn-out pacing in his movies can only be appropriate if the story lends itself to that pacing.  Unfortunately, most of them don't. \n\nChangeling is no different.\n\nThe subject matter is clearly very interesting.  The actors perform very well, including an underrated performance by Jason Butler Harner as the main criminal, Gordon Northcott.  Cinematically, the scenes are beautiful as well, with an almost black-and-white feel, even though it's in color.  The problem is the pacing. \n\nEastwood should have rewritten several scenes.  Some were unnecessarily long.  Some were unnecessary period.  The movie was way longer than it needed to be and felt every minute as long.  It should have been restructured as well as there were numerous times that the story felt as though it were ending, but then it wouldn't. \n\nThere was a point at the very end when the Eastwood explains in succinct, printed words a short epilogue of what happens to the characters years later.  What I couldn't help but think, especially after finding out that there were several pieces of history left out of the epilogue, as well as the movie itself, is that the movie could have ended about 45 minutes early and most of the later scenes summarized in the same epilogue.  It's almost as though Clint's slow, soft-spoken demeanor is related to the pace at which he thinks, and therefore shows up in his slowly-paced films. \n\nThe story is an interesting one though, but I would definitely recommend supplementing the mediocre film with additional research on the Internet.",

            "content": "Changeling is a harrow and haunting film based on a true story. Angelina Jolie is phenomenal and I have to say I'm really beginning to gain respect for her. Changeling is based on the true 1928 kidnapping case of nine year old Walter Collins. Angelina Jolie plays Walter's distraught mother Christine. The film portrays a mother's battle to find her son and how the corrupt Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) don't do their job properly and hand her a child who is not her's and accuse of her being mentally ill because they do not want to be made fools of. Changeling is a very gritty and dark film and by no means a light watch. Clint Eastwood did a good job with this movie; the cinematography is excellent and really captures the essence of the time. \r\n\r\nChangeling is a powerful and gripping thriller and drama. It's also a subject that remains relevant today with all the child kidnapping and murder cases that still go on. This is probably a film that parents can really emphasize with. As gut wrenchingly sad and horrifying this film is it's also quite empowering as Christine battles to overthrow the unjust and merciless Los Angeles Police Department with the help of reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), who often criticized the unjust police department on his radio show. John Malkovich too gives a good performance (you've just got to love John Malkovich's voice) as does Jeffrey Donovan who pays chief of the police department. Unfortunately abuse of power in authoritative positions is something that still exists, but this highlights it at it's most extreme. The Los Angeles Police Department was also hugely sexist and threw the women who questioned them into mental institutes.\r\n\r\nWhilst Changeling is a powerful and haunting film it's one that is hard to enjoy because of it's dark context. It's very bold and graphic in it's depictions of the horrors that went on such as the kidnapping and murder of the boys of the Chicken Coop Kidnapping and Murder case, which Walter Collins was part of. This is a very harrowing watch, so those who get upset easily should prepare themselves if they want to see this. I completely respect this film for it's poignancy and realness, but it was too heavy for me. It also brings home the horrifying reality that there are some truly sick and twisted people in the world like the chicken coop killer, Gordon Northcott played brilliantly by Jason Butler Harner, who is truly chilling to watch and sadistic. This is a film that you have to watch at least once.\r\n\r\nGrade: A-/B+",

            "content": "Directed by Clint Eastwood and scoring Angelina Jolie an Academy Award nomination, Changeling sounded like it would be an interesting film.\n\nChangeling consistently goes back and forth between the focus of protagonist Christie Collins suffering at the loss of her son and the penalties she faces afterwards and the focus of J.J. Jones and how he is dealing with her and the kidnapping of her child. The story manages to focus on both aspects of the story well and points out how they each contribute to the context of the story, but it means that the film is focused on the middle picture. The film does not focus on the characters and particularly how Christie Collins suffers as a result of the events in the story which means that whatever depth in the film comes from the performance of Angeline Jolie in the role, yet the film does not focus on the bigger picture either and therefore has little relevance to how these events affected the exterior town. It ends up focusing essentially on two central characters without focusing enough to get into the depth of their minds, and so it demans a lot from the actors without supplying them the best script. The language in the film is fine, the script just doesn't supply the most deep characters to the film despite the grim nature of its subject matter.\nBut aside from not being as deep as it could have, Changeling was a powerful film. The drama of the film was exceptional because of the way that it balanced focus on an oppressed woman in society dealing with the loss of her son against corrupt officials abusing their power to silence her and lie to the public. It is a kind of drama that I have seen touched upon before but never to such a complicated extent. Changeling explains how the corrupt authorities damaged individual people so harshly, particularly women who were forcibly silenced when attempting to make a change. Changeling strongly depicts the suffering and heroism of Christie Collins within an unfair society, and the pure strength of the drama is powerful because it easily depicts the harsh reality of the situation. Clint Eastwood injects a powerful atmosphere into the film to depict the nihilistic nature of society and the careless nature of the authorities in the story of Christie Collins which leaves audiences with answers about society and yet with more questions about the story. Changeling raises a lot of points and explains them well with a strongly crafted script, and so it is a powerful example of storytelling from director Clint Eastwood who proves time and time again to be able to handle the emotional power of a story with true tenacity as a filmmaker.\nVisually, Changeling is terrific. Capturing the time setting of 1928 Los Angeles, Changeling is full of convincing scenery and a strong production design which reinforces the nature of the time setting and the location of the film. The costumes the characters wear also reinforce this and give viewers a sense of the time which feels very legitimate, and it is all captured with very nice cinematography. The visual plane of the film has a certain feel of monochromatic grey to it on a consistent basis which establishes a grim feel. But the most powerful aspect of the film is the leading performance of Angelina Jolie.\nAngelina Jolie has never given a more powerful performance than her leading role in Changeling. I consider her a bit over an overrated actress, but I found a new level of respect for her after witnessing the endeavour of her acting skills in Changeling. Angelina Jolie involves herself deeply with her role in Changeling and makes a very sympathetic figure for the lead part which is very admirable as she projects a lot of powerful vulnerability which means that the emotional power of the film ends up striking. Her performance is exceptional and is so firm with how it deals with the powerfully hard hitting nature of the story that it is difficult to walk away from Changeling having not been mesmerized. She perfectly fits the profile of the 1920's setting because she has a face which matches the style of beauty that was popular in the time, and she goes into the role with serious depth. Angelina Jolie captures the frailty of her character with physical acting to exceptional extents and she delivers her lines with such emotional power that it is pretty shocking. Angelina Jolie gives a performance of clear Academy Award calibre in Changeling and it is so amazing that it is hard to walk away from it not feeling the pure strength that is the endeavour of her acting talents.\nJeffrey Donovan is also terrific. In a nice change of pace from his performance as Michael Westen in Burn Notice, Jeffrey Donovan takes on the leading role as corrupt police officer J.J. Jones in Changeling which has him turn in another powerful performance. The thing is that Jeffrey Donovan keeps his performance strong by consistently maintaining a level of sophisticated professionalism in the part and he rarely lets his emotions get the best of him because as a police captain he cannot let his own personal bias affect how people see him. Jeffrey Donovan takes on the part well because he never directly expresses an antagonistic nature in the role and it therefore makes him a manipulative figure. Jeffrey Donovan is a great casting decision in Changeling.\nJohn Malkovich also turns in a powerful supporting performance by putting his natural charm and determination into their part. Jason Butler Harner does a tense job as well, and Amy Ryan shares some strong scenes with Angelina Jolie.\n\nSo despite the fact that Changeling goes for the middle ground and does not end up as deep as it could have been, it is a powerfully grim film which benefits from tense direction from Clint Eastwood as well as an amazing leading performance from Angelina Jolie in the best work of her career.",

When she came home, she discovered he had vanished and she went out of the house to search for for months. Later on, a boy claimed to be Walter is taken back to the house but when she finds out that he is a changeling, they return him back. Knowing in her heart the real Walter is out there somewhere,  she pushes authorities to keep looking but since it is the Prohibition-era in L.A., women don't challenge the system. She fights the city to find her missing son with the help of an ally in activist Reverend Gustav Briegleb played by John Malkovich who is also looking for his missing son. I remember watching this movie a long time ago and I was amazed at how dark this movie was. Sometimes it can be difficult for a parent to lose their child and they search the world for them. But in other lives especially nowadays, it is different. Parents tend to not care about their children's lives and laugh in their faces thinking their dreams will never come true which is what causes them to run away in the first place. Changeling gets a 10/10.",

            "content": "The Los Angeles Police Department was considered to be corrupt and incompetent in 1928. The police thought they'd scored a public relations coup when they found a 9-year-old boy who'd been missing for over 5 months. But the boy's mother, Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) said the boy they found wasn't her son. She made this claim so often, the police locked her up in a psychiatric ward, without a warrant or court order. This Clint Eastwood-directed film dramatizes this true story, which is bound up with that of a serial killer who may have abducted and killed the Christine's real son, along with several other boys.\nThis period film unravels the various threads slowly. This is a mystery and a police procedural, except some of the police procedures are brutal and misogynistic. Jolie gives an excellent performance as the working-class but intelligent mother who only wants to know where her real son is. The introduction of the serial killer sub-plot seemed a bit obvious and contrived (as a phone call to the police station while Christine is there to ask once again for the police to continue searching for her son). But the two plots are connected; as one of the DVD's special features said, if this story weren't true, you'd never believe it.\nThis is a long and slow-paced film driven mainly by dialogue. It is riveting and well-made, but some may find it overlong and slow. The performances and the look and feel all feel authentic to the period.\nIn a modern era of revelations about government surveillance and abuse of power, this story tells us that, perhaps, this is nothing new. People in positions of power will often abuse that power to retain it. And they'll convince themselves they're doing it for our benefit. Collins shows us, however, that, perhaps with a little help from influential supporters, abusers will eventually have to face the the fact that they cannot alter the truth forever.",

The plot is taken from early history of Los Angeles, in which a woman Christine Collins says goodbye one day to her son, Walter, never to see him again.  This kind of story involving a child's disappearance naturally attracts most people's attention.  An added plus is that Angelina Jolie plays the mother and it is based on a true story.  Clint Eastwood goes to great length to make the setting right for 1928 LA.  You see the cars of that era, clothing fits perfectly and the buildings are definitely those from 1928 Los Angeles.  The fact that Christine Collins is treated so badly by LA Police Department and in fact thrown into a mental institution adds to an already stressful situation.  Some may dismiss this drama and refuse to believe that this actually happened.  Perhaps these people need to refer to their history books, especially about LA's history.  Their history is full of controversy, prejudice and racism.  Anyone familiar with this, would have no trouble believing this story.  All in all, Eastwood does an excellent job as always in casting the characters, perfecting the setting and the general mood of the movie.",

I was bored for large chunks of the film despite the perfection of the acting and cinematography. The script was decent but nothing special. The musical score was fitting and enhanced the film.\n\n\nAngelina Jolie could easily have won best actress for her performance in this film. I haven't seen many films with flapper outfits but she rocks hers incredibly well. She covered the full range of emotions throughout the film and was able to advance the central themes around which the plot is structured (government corruption, disempowerment of women, violence and children).\n\nI think that the film really failed to make any real impression on me with its diverse themes. The main thing that I got from the film was that Angelina was a persevering mother who was going to find her kid at all costs. The other stuff seemed superfluous and stretched the film to quite a needlessly long length.\n\nI would like to put in a good word for the costuming. Make that a great word! They were fantastic\n\nOVERALL: A really good film if you want something to get you in the mood for the late 1920s but it has some significant drawbacks.\n\nRECOMMENDED TO PEOPLE IN THE MOOD FOR THE 1920s.",

            "content": "I am absolutely shocked that this could happen. The film is based on a true story, and for the most part stays accurate. I can't fathom the amount of corruption and utter disgust in which the LAPD handled this situation. I can't imagine how a simple filmmaker like Clint Eastwood, the producer and director of the film, can transport me into the world of the late 1920s so flawlessly. Clint Eastwood is also the composer of the film, by the way. What? Clint Eastwood can write music? Apparantly.\r\n\r\nThe story is so touching and so unbelievable. A single mother, Christine Collins(Angelina Jolie in a breathtaking performance), comes home from work one day to find her son missing. When she calls the police, they tell her to wait 24 hours to see if he comes back. When he still doesn't, she calls again. The police begin an investigation and manipulate a young boy to pretend to be Collins' son in order to make it seem as if the LAPD is getting something good accomplished. They live off of the press, and the returning of a lost boy would most certainly erase the corruption they've been excersizing. Christine claims that the boy is not her son, and the LAPD does everything in their power to try to convince the public that it is her son, they go so far as to throw her into an insane asylum.\r\n\r\nIt gets worse, but I'll leave it to the film to explain what happens next. This story is amazing and should be told. It is every bit relevant to us today to look back at the past and examine what we want for our future. Clint Eastwood is a master filmmaker and this one is no exception. The pacing and editing are tightly wound, and the narrative is close to perfection. The performances are also great, by the way. Angelina Jolie is fascinating in the leading spot. Not at one single point in the film did I ever think of her as Angelina Jolie. She is a total embodiement of the character, and she deserves an Oscar nod. Malkovich is also good, and a stand out performance comes from Jason Butler Harner as Gordon Northcott.\r\n\r\nThe film is conceived as a film from the late 20s mixed with the films of today. Modern day philosophy(in one particular scene, a woman has this to say about the LAPD: \"Fuck them, and the horse the rode in on.\" When Christine tells her that that isn't proper language, the woman says, \"There are times when that's exactly the right language.\" Later, Christine uses the same phrase.) combined with conventional filmmaking of old. Critics will undoubtedly be hard on the film for using conventional techniques, but is there really any other way to tell this story? If it had been the least bit stylized, it would have ruined the emotional dexterity and narrative integrity of the film.\r\n\r\nI applaud the efforts of Eastwood to bring this story to life, and I hope to see the film again. If the Academy had any sort of a brain, they would nominate the film for Best Picture. However, since the Academy does not have any sort of a brain, the film will not be nominated. I could be wrong. There's a great moment in the film when Christine and her co-workers are placing bets over which film will win Best Picture. Every one else says 'Cleopatra'. Christine says, \"Overrated. 'It Happened One Night' will win; Clark Gabele, Claudette Colbert, what more can I say?\" 'It Happened One Night' ends up winning the prize. Let's hope this film follows suite.",

            "content": "Christine Collins (Jolie): I used to tell Walter, \"Never start a fight... but always finish it.\" I didn't start this fight... but by God, I'm going to finish it. \n\nThis was really a very interesting film and truly scary, not because it was graphic or violent like most torture-porn flicks like \"Saw\", but because this movie was based on true events. With the exception of Jack the Ripper (who was from an entirely different continent and belonged to a much earlier time-line), I'm sure Mr. Northcott's crime was still pretty shocking, if not unheard of for that era. But what is just as disturbing was the atrocities committed by the L.A.P.D. against Christine Collins and the other women who had the guts to question their actions (or in Christine's case inaction) and lodge a complaint against their incompetence. I think, I'm starting to like Clint Eastwood as a director more than an actor because I've seen a lot of his old Spaghetti Westerns and frankly, I don't see the attraction for that genre of film. But I've watched a lot of Mr. Eastwood's directorial projects like \"Million-Dollar Baby\", \"Mystic River\", \"Gran Torino\", \"Absolute Power\", \"Hereafter\" and \"Midnight At The Garden of Good and Evil\" and I can safely state that I like his directing style much better. I love Angelina Jolie, but as an actress, she's hit or miss for me. She's perfect for action roles like as \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\", \"Salt\", \"The Tourist\" or \"Wanted\" and can be cool in odd films like \"Hackers\" or \"Girl Interrupted\" but I also remember that God-awful performance in the period drama \"Alexander\".  Fortunately, this film wasn't like \"Alexander\" but although \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\" either, she still gave a pretty good and convincing performance. I loved Jason Butler Harner portrayal of Gordon Northcott, chilling an truly creepy, but as much as I love John Malkovich, he was an odd choice for the role of Rev. Gustav Briegleb and I quite honestly feel was a miscast. I kept waiting for him to do something goofy for some reason. But overall, this was a pretty cool movie, beautifully directed, good actors and incredible story.",
