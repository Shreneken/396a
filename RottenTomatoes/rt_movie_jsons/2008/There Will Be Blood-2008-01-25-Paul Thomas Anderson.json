I know they're not supposed to be thrill a minute as much as they go through the real emotions of a situation, but I can't help it, it's true. This one did the best job of any of holding my attention though. Daniel Day Lewis was amazing to watch. The rest of the cast holds their own as well, though they can't help but stand in his shadow. The historic scenery is some of the best I've ever seen as well. The emotion of the story mostly hit for me too, which is something I miss in some of PTA's other work. I don't think this is one that I'll want to watch regularly, but I will probably revisit it someday, which is more than I was expecting. 8.5/10",

There are compelling moments and the story is somewhat interesting but I was shocked at the end  of the movie to find out it was only 2 and a half hours and not the 3 and a half that it felt like.

The cinematography is pitch-perfect, the editing patient, and the score is utterly haunting. And anchoring the entire film is Daniel Day-Lewis in his scenery chewing, riveting portrayal of this one man's descent into madness.

I found his ambition and sociopathy relatable in that aspire to be that way, though I am far too lazy to accomplish it.

Jonny Greenwood's music is atmospheric and haunting as well, the script is lyrical, hysterical and sometimes even baffling, the story is excellent and thematically rich and the pace is fine, quite slow but deliberately so.\n\nThere Will be Blood is brilliantly directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and the characters are intriguing. In fact to me the character of Daniel Plainview makes the movie. Magnificently portrayed by Daniel Day Lewis, he is quite complex- while monstrous and cold-hearted, because of his love for his adopted son I wouldn't necessarily call him completely evil either. Paul Dano also does a fine job as Eli Sunday.\n\nOverall, a truly fine film and one of the best of the last decade in my view. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

As an adult actor he has had a role in no more than 28 cinema and television films or series, and as everything from two minutes as a South African street thug in Gandhi 1982, to portraying the great president Abraham Lincoln thirty years later. It's not because he has spent so much of his time in the theatre, as he ended that part of his career already in 1989, as Hamlet. The only three times Academy Award winning main actor has just chosen his parts wisely, been extremely selective, and with great success. Considering the roles he has played, the characters have been incredibly different, whether he's been the cerebral palsy struck Christy Brown in My Left Foot, or a stunning Hawkeye in The last of the Mohicans, his amazing flexibilty as a screen performer probably has no competition, maybe with exception of Gary Oldman. All in all it's not easy to say what has been his greatest achievement. Personally I rate My Left Foot high, but it's possible that Day-Lewis also managed to outshine even himself as the ruthless oil pioneer Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood. His performance in this film is so intens that he is the film, more than he is its main character, and just maybe this time it's too much. Regardless, he is considered as one of the greatest film actors of all times, and now he's said to have retired from the profession.",

            "content": "It often feels like achieving success in America is primarily predicated on A's ability to influence B to support the same plans or ideas that will most benefit A, regardless of the actual impact or effect these plans or ideas will have on B.\n\nThis struggle for our focus and attention comes in many forms and from many angles, in a relentless barrage day after day, much of it totally unnoticeable to us as it is happening. We have not only allowed and accepted this behavior but have come to expect it from nearly all facets of society, creating a breeding ground for the widespread cases of greed and avarice that are hurting so many and helping so few, today.\n\nI don't intend to appear overly cynical as I do believe the large majority of people will treat others fairly if treated fairly in return, however the minute a Daniel Plainview or Eli Sunday attempt to take more for themselves through less scrupulous means \"Henry Plainviews\" start showing up everywhere looking to be excused, with the rest of society, from chastisement, for attempting the same.\n\nThis dynamic, and the ensuing result up to now, is beautifully explored by Paul Thomas Anderson, utilizing the extremely apt setting of the oil boom and evangelical movement to examine the type of Raskolnikov like figure or Nietzchean ubermensch (and their relationships with others) who find it so easy to flourish amid these two distinct, yet totally conducive, backdrops.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis delivers a once in a decade performance as Daniel Plainview, the monomaniacal chaser of oil who appears to see all humans, including his adopted son H.W., as a tool in his neverending pursuit of the unachieveable.\n\nPlainview's relationship with his \"son\" probably provides the worst indictment of his true nature, but it is the cat and mouse like exchanges with preacher Eli Sunday throughout this film that best illustrates what those infected with the sickness of greed are willing to compromise to satisfy the craving.\n\nBeing that I find the manipulative nature of modern religion beyond infuriating I actually found myself somehow sympathetic to Plainview in those scenes where he is attempting to expose Eli, if only to Eli himself, for what Eli really is. (Google: \"Joel Osteen money in walls\" or \"Catholic Church given $1.4 billion in covid PPP loans\")\n\nWe then get to view Plainview from the reverse angle when his brother arrives, as Daniel was now subjected to the same manipulation of his innate desires he himself had become so proficient at uncovering and putting to work (probably even unconsciously in most cases) for himself, in others.\n\nThis was a near flawless work of art from start to finish, both in narrative and technical aspects, with one of the best performances from an actor in my lifetime. The PTA and Day-Lewis collab is an absolute grand slam as each bring such a hypnotic and mesmerizing quality to their work that, when melded together, you can't help but become totally entranced and experience time disappearing much quicker. The Greenwood score punctuates many of these scenes brilliantly, adding a level of emotional tension most composers are incapable of reaching. Paul Dano and Dillon Freasier deserve to be mentioned as well and added crucial support and an important counter to the immensely imposing figure of Daniel Plainview.\n\nI always remembered this as a phenomenal film and think it somehow gained even more respect from me on this watch, over a decade later.",

It's almost an additional actor in terms how much of a role it plays in creating the \"feel\" of each scene. \n\nPaul Dano puts in the performance of a lifetime, and while I love Javier Bardem in \"No Country for Old Men\", I feel like Dano should have gotten the Oscar for this. He chews up every scene that he is in, transitioning through a timid up-and-coming preacher into an over-confident prophet. \n\nThere's really too much to say about this masterpiece that would fit into a small Rotten Tomatoes review, but I will sum it up as this:\nIt is a deep character study mixed with a commentary on the rise of the capitalistic mentality in which people will sell their souls for a dollar.

Incongruent because the treasure chest he so ostentatiously bedecks contains nothing but air. In Anderson's world, style ever serves as a presumptuous stand-in for substance. Carefully embellished meaninglessness assumes the guise of a profound, impenetrable enigma. Memorable as they are, his characters never evolve, his plots never take full shape, and this particular film sprawls inertly across its ambitious running time exhibiting no hint of purpose or structural discipline.

            "content": "In the first of two collaborations with three time Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis, director Paul Thomas Anderson has created what Many experts call a Masterpiece with There Will Be Blood. Prospector Daniel Plainview is in the desert at the end of the 19th/beginning of the 20th century in search of oil, which was the most valuable and sought-after resource at the time shortly after its discovery. In the course of his success and wealth, the wayward Plainview meets people who stand in his way. Even those in his inner circle.\n\nDaniel Plainview is a complex character who, on paper, is just a bitter and ruthless man who doesn't like people and won't let anything or anyone stop him in his lust for power and money. Daniel Day-Lewis gives this unsympathetic character many more facets with his incredibly passionate performance. Initially a visibly passionate oil seeker and caring father, he develops into a greedy and loveless monster who additionally cultivates murderous intentions. That results from the highly sensitive soul Plainview carries within him. Day-Lewis is known for disappearing into his characters and never leaving them over the course of the entire film shoot. Nowhere does this ability come through more clearly and brilliantly than in There Will Be Blood. He manages to demonstrate an unexpectedly multi-dimensional character and make him somehow likeable despite all his misdeeds. This fact also underlies Paul Dano's portrayal of the priest Eli, whose chemistry with Day-Lewis' character could not be more toxic. Their scenes together are mostly pure madness and completely captivate you thanks to their terrific explosiveness. The performances of the two are clearly the focus of this film, which makes the other, mainly male actors, look like statits.\n\nThe point of the clear preponderance of male characters is a minor criticism. Plainview, for example, has no real interaction with a woman in the full 2 ½ hours, which is a concern given his epic screen time. Furthermore, the final act of the film must be viewed with a question mark, because it ends somewhat abruptly and exaggeratedly. As significant as the plot around the greed of capitalists, the importance of family and its religious component may be, it also gets lost in its tediousness at times. Without Day-Lewis' enormous presence, There Will Be Blood would not be the classic it is. Because of that, it has more than earned this status. But not only the phenomenal performances, but also a very close camera work and a score that always takes on a contrary mood to the action are among the film's great strengths. Even though the film is extremely quiet for over 80% and not very dialogue-heavy, these sequences with the beautiful images are hardly boring. When dialogue does occur, it is well written and perfectly delivered by the actors. There Will Be Blood is not a flawless film, but a memorable one.",

With his fifth feature, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson crafted a mesmerizing epic about a greedy oilman that holds up today as a modern classic. Using gorgeous cinematography, Anderson draws viewers into the world of a ruthless businessman searching for wealth in the early 20th Century. From intimate close-ups to breathtaking landscape shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's period setting. The production sets, sound design and musical score are all carefully chosen, combining to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. As usual, Anderson draws powerful performances from his cast. Daniel Day-Lewis delivers one of the best performances of his career as Daniel Plainview. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys the ambition, greed and callous nature of an oilman in pursuit of personal success. It's a towering performance that represents the finest screen acting you'll ever see. In the supporting cast, Paul Dano leaves a lasting impression as a selfish preacher with evil intentions. Although \"There Will be Blood\" is undeniably unforgettable, ultimately it is not a film that will appeal to everyone. The film offers a dark, disturbing and at times horrific depiction of capitalism that may upset mainstream audiences. Nevertheless, fans of Paul Thomas Anderson will definitely enjoy \"There Will be Blood\" and so will movie-goers seeking thought-provoking entertainment. At a time when modern audiences have never heard of Daniel Plainview, its a stirring reminder that the stories of capitalistic entrepreneurs are worth retelling on the big-screen.",

            "content": "There Will Be Blood will open your eyes and ears to what value is, life. This story of money, power and religion combined will shatter and captivate your mind. The filmmaking by Robert Elswit and music by Jonny Greenwood both captured the moment of every scene. The film is slightly based on one of the greatest tycoons of the 19th century and novel Oil! By Upton Sinclair. Set in early western times, in the desert and mountains where men wore wide brim hats and oil mining was the road to riches. Beautifully directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and dramatic as the title, the film holds dark truth.\nA story about a century old, being told in 2007 was surprisingly done through their filmmaking. There are views from above like drones and the landscape spread of deserts and mountains made me feel it was present. The music of each dramatic scene of an oil well explodes, for the little joy of the story. The music that makes you feel like it's Halloween will surprise you, in an eerie way when there is violins and drums drumming in the background during the suspense.\nThe story will bring religion back to life  through the music and filmmaking, ghost casting sermon in an evanglisticaly Sunday church service and the hopeful faith in people. The film is not for all, I strongly recommend the mature ones to watch with an open mind. The two main characters are Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis and Eli Sunday played by Paul Dano. Daniel Plainview is an oilman, a family man, and surprisingly a low key sociopath. Then Eli Sunday is a miracle worker, a healer, church pastor of The Third Revelation. Both characters are impressive Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday, who become arch-enemies, are as explosive as the dynamite explosions scenes in the film. Both their performances were compelling, Daniel Day-Lewis played the calm and convincing voice of a firm gentleman, a loving father but with a dark greed. Eli Sunday playing the innocent looking young holy man also holding onto greed. They both portray the good and the bad, of heaven and of hell. \nThe story of Daniel Plainview is clearly appreciated when he set out to get rich and did become rich. His passionate desire to have power over his family, his business and people, drove him to do the unexpected. Plainview struggled with religion for he was a man that did not believe in God and refused to believe. The struggle will showcase the good and the bad when these two characters collide in a provoking way.  Either if you're a believer of God or not, the performances will have you believe otherwise. \nTo appreciate this film in its entirety, you must bring together the whole story. There was more to it, than getting money and letting greed take over you. There was also a gentle side to Plainview's humanity, that I most admired. He becomes a father to an orphan and whom he dearly loved, named HW Plainview. There is a patch of sunshine between the father and son family relationship. The story of a loving parent, a partially unconditional father was written well into the story. The relationship is evident when Plainview endures the traumatic event of his son disabled and the responsibility he felt. The ending was not quite right but it was evident he loved his child. There was a memory played at the end, showing a short glimpse of how a father and son loved each other to later grow apart. The story between the two is really evident to this day, just as we were young growing up in our families then grew apart as we got older. \nFittlgly, the film holds a dark truth despite a story from a century ago that it can be retold as a new story. The grim reality is that having more money does not make you powerful and that money can't buy happiness or family. Ultimately, greed of money within a person, can make you kill someone, disown your loved one and worst of all, is to lose yourself.\nThe ending will shatter your mind. Truly, the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano will strike a match. As the two end their arch-enemy battle, it touches the subject about religion where the good and the bad is at war. The violent music that plays at this scene will cover your mind. After fully watching the movie twice, I realized this film was written and directed just right in history, to a new decade. I truly enjoyed watching and possibly not going to forget for how vibrant it sounded and how it made me believe and feel at the end.",

            "content": "The title of Paul Thomas Anderson's 2007 powerful period epic is a promise to the audience. It is eerie and intriguing. During the film's opening title card, the font is aged and gothic, immediately invoking a sense of antiquation. In fact, our tale begins in the waning years of the 19th century. The opening shot fades in—a bright New Mexican desert backdropped by Jonny Greenwood's swelling and unnerving string music, immediately attacking the viewer's senses like a buzzing swarm of locusts, reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann's score during the opening credits of \"Psycho,\" the definitive sound of horror music. Anderson says, \"Underneath it all, we were making a horror film.\"\n\nWe see a solitary man painstakingly prospecting for silver in a stony pit mine. After dynamiting a lode, he falls down the shaft and brutally breaks his leg. However, he is able to save a sample of silver before hauling himself back up. He is surrounded by mountains and rocks—an arid wasteland. We do not actually see his journey back to town, the viewer is forced to imagine him dragging himself by his elbows for miles and miles through the rugged terrain and suffocating heat to seek medical attention and more importantly, an assay office to certify his findings.\n\nWe have not yet learned his name or heard his voice, but this subtle moment tells the audience absolutely everything they need to know about the ruthless and relentless Daniel Plainview long before his salespitching, struggling to buy land, negotiating contracts, or establishing a reputation as an oil tycoon. Daniel accomplishing this improbable feat gives him the heroic right to every action that follows, even the unpleasant and despicable ones. He is not a bloodsucking businessman, like H.M. Tilford, whom Daniel tells to \"scratch around in the dirt and find it like the rest of us instead of buying up someone else's hard work.\" Daniel himself is marred by sweat, blood, and oil.\n\nAnderson adds, \"It's hard for me not to see Plainview as a little bit heroic—he's enormously ambitious, and I can sympathize with his quest for survival, particularly during that time in the West.\" Throughout the film's first 20 minutes, we see the harsh conditions that paved the path to prosperity for Daniel Plainview and many other men during the early 20th century. Extracting oil from the ground is dangerous work as men perish along the way. When Daniel first strikes oil, he swipes his hand across the drill bit and raises it high above his head, a moment of triumph and discovery for our hero.\n\nAt the heart of the film is a conflict between two men, oil entrepreneur Daniel Plainview and young preacher Eli Sunday whose family's ranch sits atop oceans of oil which Plainview eventually reaps for massive profit. Two forces clash against one another—religion and capitalism, and neither one is portrayed in a favorable light. At the time of their meeting, Daniel and Eli share a lust for power and conquest. They are both rather nascent and interested in spreading their influence—Eli by proselytizing, and Daniel, by deed.\n\nThese two characters are set apart since Eli is a whiny baby-faced boy and Daniel is a man grown with a gruff voice similar to John Huston's. This voice provides the backbone for the character. Daniel's dulcet tones are paradoxically charming and perverse. For Eli and the followers of his church, the promised land is an intangible concept achieved by a lifetime of devotion to God. For Plainview and his associates, the promised land is beneath their very feet. It is through initiative and action they can bask in its glory. The film is best summed up by its tagline, \"When ambition meets faith.\"\n\nOil was the lifeblood of industrialization and prosperity in America. \"There Will Be Blood\" does not mess around with metaphor or allegory, it is pure text for the beginning of capitalism in the Industrial Age and a re-enactment of historical events, e.g., Southern California's oil boom and the \"robber baron\" era of American industry. The film is a foretelling of the horrors of capitalism unchecked by morality, a theme which Anderson no doubt derived from the Upton Sinclair novel \"Oil!\" which \"There Will Be Blood\" is loosely based upon.\n\nThe American Dream is the foundation of many modern American values, such as faith in the idea that, through unceasing strife, one can renounce the circumstances of their birth and create a prosperous future for themselves. Plainview is a personification of this concept which would later be coined as \"rugged individualism.\" As Jean-Paul Sartre put it, \"Hell is other people.\" Daniel confesses to having \"a competition\" in him, wanting \"no one else to succeed,\" and hating \"most people.\" Men like him are most willing to manipulate and squash those around them, and therefore are rewarded the most. This, accompanied by his dreams of avarice, makes Daniel a living realization of American individualism, a genuine champion of capitalism, and a dark personification of the American dream. The film and its themes are dense, uncompromising and deeply American.\n\nUpon an alternate viewing of the film, these aforementioned themes quickly fall to the wayside in favor of family emerging as the most important force in the film. The themes of greed and capitalism can easily be considered context for an emotional character study to unravel. Success and grandeur are meaningless without the bond of family to suppress the wistful longings of a troubled man. Plainview eventually becomes a reclusive alcoholic despite his massive wealth and large mansion. His tragic character arc resembles that of Charles Foster Kane. Just as Mr. Bernstein says, \"It's no trick to make a lot of money… if all you want is to make a lot of money.\"\n\nDaniel ends up with no family or real friends, just those who work for him. Unlike Kane, he lacks a \"Rosebud,\" some nostalgic token he clings to or a redeeming quality he displays. Daniel feels no regret or pity, which drives him to unimaginable acts of madness and sociopathy.\n\nThe film is an extraordinary masterpiece, from a towering performance by virtuoso Daniel Day-Lewis, a brilliant cinematic set piece—the cataclysmic gas blowout and subsequent extinguishing of the oil fire, Jonny Greenwood's atonal score, and a brutal denouement full of sound and fury—all among the greatest in the history of modern cinema. \"There Will Be Blood\" is a wonderful portrait of a man consumed by ego and misanthropic contempt for anyone who steps in his path.",

Outside of two explosive (and psychotic) encounters between the main two characters, most everything is easily anticipated, so much so that boredom sets in.  \nI can't let Day-Lewis' lead role and excellent acting have me go along with the crowd, pretending that this was a fulfilling cinematic experience.  Production values are good, but they don't make up for having to sit through a long story about the crossing paths of two very unsavory and largely psychotic opportunists.",

In many ways it reminded me of Elmer Gantry (1960) which covers a lot of the same ground and has many issues but features characters that we care about and a storyline that does not carry the same air of self importance present throughout this film. Perhaps it is the excessive length of the film that makes audiences who want to believe they are intellectual praise the film at such length despite it's obvious flaws.\n\nIn the late 1890s gold prospector Daniel Plainview, Daniel Day-Lewis, establishes himself in Los Angeles as a successful businessman and adopts the son of a deceased employee who makes it easier for him to fool investors. He sees a business opportunity when he crosses paths with the religious Paul Sunday, Paul Dano, who informs Plainview that there is oil under his family's house and he would like him to purchase the land. Plainview is forced to invest in the Church Sunday's twin brother Eli, Paul Dano, serves as pastor of in buying the house and is able to quickly purchase all of the land that surrounds the house but faces opposition in the stubborn William Bandy, Hans Howes, who refuses to sell. When Plainview does not pay the Sundays the money he owes them conflict arises between the men. They find a way to resolve their issues when Plainview murders Henry, Kevin J. O'Connor, who had pretended to be his long lost brother and Eli is given the opportunity to publicly humiliate him and force him to pay the money he owes. Plainview grows wealthier but becomes a bitter alcoholic as an old man and with the return of Eli his violent tendencies begin to emerge.\n\nThis is a film that screams that it is important and is saying something important about American history and the nature of humanity. This is why the sort of university students who love to ‘explain' the genius of Albert Camus to you and discuss why silent cinema is underappreciated by the masses who only like to hear the dulcet tones of accessible cinema. I am always irritated by the showiness of Paul Thomas Anderson's films as while I can acknowledge that he crafts beautiful looking films he can't seem to get out of his way when it comes to telling a story. This film is a case in point as the cinematography featured is glorious but it overstates all of the points it makes too much and is so enamored of itself that it ends in an unforgivably indulgent final scene. All of Anderson's worst habits crop up here as he allows the cast, particularly Day-Lewis, to chew the scenery and lets that Jonny Greenwood score overwhelm several scenes.\n\nHe attempts to evoke Citizen Kane (1941) and create his own masterpiece but he forgets that while that film was vast in scope and technically ambitious it also featured a compelling and sympathetic main character. Even as Kane descended into madness and abused those around him he retained a sense of childlike innocence and sweeping ambition that was crushed by his own trauma and loss of happiness as a child. We know little about Plainview as a child and when his brother shows up he seems to know little about him and his discussions with him fail to reveal much about him as a person. He is emotionally cold but he has been this way since the beginning of the film and so his abandonment of his son and brutal murder of those who have lied to him do not have the resonance that they should. His shocking brutality and lack of care about anything is exciting at first as we are not used to figures this unlikable but we quickly become bored of him as he does not change or grow in any way. This is a common problem with Anderson's films as he seems to identify with rigid men obsessed with their own greatness more than the fascinating characters he crafts on the fringe of the sprawling stories he writes.\n\nThe most interesting character in this film is Eli who has the angelic looks of Dano but is a capitalist at heart and seeks to financially benefit from the oil being mined in his area. The conflict within himself as he wrestles with the differences between his religious values and his own self serving desires would have been interesting to see more of. We sacrifice Dano's rich, layered performance for a bombastic, over the top show from Day-Lewis who is possibly the only actor who could get away with a performance this bad. He received an Academy Award for his performance and I do not see why as he applies no restraint to his performance and all of his bravado and excess is directed nowhere. When he yells \"I drink your milkshake!\" I wanted to laugh as we are meant to take this as gospel but I was disgusted by how full of themselves Day-Lewis and Anderson are to think that they could get away with this.",

            "content": "When I first heard of There Will Be Blood, I heard of all of its 2008 Oscar nominations and wins. When I asked around about the film I got very different opinions. Some people I asked said they hated the film and said it was \"one of the worst and pointless films they had ever seen\". Yet many other people I asked said \"it is one of the best films I've seen...\" so I didn't really know what to expect going into this film if anything my expectations were low. The film blew me away in almost every way possible. The cinematography is absolutely stunning, especially the shots of the major gas blowout. But basically every shot in the film is beautiful. The music is very memorable and fits the film perfectly and really builds tension in many scenes. Daniel Day-Lewis gives one of the best performances on film. He is absolutely mesmerizing in every scene he is in. Paul Dano also gives an amazing performance as the false prophet and the tension between him and Day-Lewis is amazing to watch and creates major intensity in the film. The actor's blocking is excellent as well and there are a few scenes where the power dynamics shift a lot and create a very memorable scene (this is the confrontation scene). The characters also create this weird feeling in the audience where you don't want to like them, but deep down you can relate to them. You can relate to them because the people in this film have a deep desire and are willing to do anything to get what they want. This is relateable to a certain point, I think most people can relate to having something that they really want, just maybe not to this extreme point. The plot is great and this film is a great character study but the only reason I didn't give it 5/5 was because it did drag in a few places. Even though I think this film is a masterpiece, I can understand why people do not like it. The film is very dark, tackling themes of greed, abuse, paranoia, and more which doesn't necessarily make it a bad film, just maybe hard to watch or non-enjoyable for some viewers. Overall, There Will Be Blood is a masterpiece in filmmaking and deserves the praise it gets, a definite must-see.",

Great cinematography. Very immersive. Intriguing and interesting setting. I'll be honest... the wordless first few minutes of the movie set my intrigue sky high, and I was SO sure this movie would be great. \n\nThe trailer and scenes from YouTube also teased a better movie than this. I thought this was going to be a locked-horn battle of wits and influence between a man with promises of riches vs a man with promises of Salvation from God... and those moments surely happened, but were sparse.\n\nThe protagonist/anti-hero was on-the-whole unrelatable. The antagonist was dominated at every turn (except for a 5 minute scene). There was only one brief attempt at creating a supporting character... and even that was half-assed\n\nIn a way, this movie was TOO authentic. This movie was every bit as slow-paced and boring as the life of an oil-driller in 1900.\n\nThe movie ATTEMPTED to absolve itself of its own sins in the last 5 minutes of the movie, but the payoff was more strange than it was gratifying.\n\nI put this movie into a class of movies I call \"pseudo-masterpieces\". A pseudo-masterpiece is a movie that is well made cosmetically... but there's no 'there' there. Movies such as \"All the King's Men\" and \"Lost in Translation\" that through simple sunk costs (time and attention) people tend to walk away feeling as though they saw something profound... and people start analyzing symbology to justify the non-gratifying nature of the movie.\n\nNo... you can have a highly symbolic AND watchable movie.

Still afflicted with Oscar fever, I followed up my viewing of The Reader with There Will Be Blood, which won Daniel Day-Lewis an Oscar for Best Actor last year.\n\nGritty, cold and, at times, cruel, this period piece set in the late 1800s through the Great Depression, There Will Be Blood is, at its core, about the business of...well, business, versus the business of salvation. Neither are proven to be better, or worse, as the case may be, than the other except for maybe, in the end, Daniel Day-Lewis' character is shown to be more exact in his evil, while his moral counterpart, Eli, is shown to be naive in his selfishness.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson continues his track record of unique and heavily character-driven films, in the vein of Boogie Nights, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. As usual, his characters are immensely flawed and capable of the most atrocious of actions. He's quickly becoming a master of creating characters who actually do what only our darkest moments think of doing, if then.\n\nAs usual, Daniel Day-Lewis is outstanding in his role, commanding immense strength on the screen. The Oscar was well-deserved.\n\nMy only real criticism of the film is that the portrayal of Eli's religious con-man being made into the weak, whiny hypocrite that he becomes, comes across more as a personal indictment of Anderson's rather than an necessary element of the movie, specifically Eli's senseless murder in the end. Unlike the seemingly objectivity of The Reader, There Will Be Blood shamelessly overexaggerates the stupidity of the congregation (and, believe me, I cannot believe I'm saying that since I generally believe Christianity to be silly). If Eli is proven to be a great fool, what then of the congregation who put such faith in him? It rubbed me the wrong way, but didn't make me enjoy the film less. Perhaps portraying Daniel as an empty, soul-less man is meant to counter the naivete of his enemy.",

            "content": "An oil empire rises among the fallen.\n\nDirector Paul Thomas Anderson crafts a harrowing tale of an oil baron building his life. It is massive in scope, but never forgets its heart. You get to watch a man manipulate, con, and steamroll his way to success. It is a character study of Daniel Plainview as much as it is an epic on the rise of capitalism. You bear witness to a father attempting to raise a boy, while prioritizing his business. There Will Be Blood is truly a monster. It's lengthy run time feels quite slow as I suspect most viewers will find its molasses pace to be too crawling. I assure you however, the pay off is well worth the wait. It is a brilliant story told in an incredible way.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson finds every interesting angle to showcase the acting performances, bleak environment, and dismal prospects. You will be astonished by There Will Be Blood's sights. I think the narrative alone is worth the price of admission. Anderson delivers a compelling tale based on Upton Sinclair's \"Oil!\" \n\nAlthough, Anderson could edit down his films more, he gives you everything. The elongated shots, one takes, panning shots, and clever sequences all work to keep you enthralled to the madness on screen.\n\nAs I mentioned, the acting is top tier in There Will Be Blood. Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano play the most cruel, manipulative, self-absorbed monsters in cinema history. They portray men that care not for others and they play it beautifully. All their subtle movements and eye work reveal their deeper convictions. These are what powerhouse performances look like.\n\nMusically, this movie lavishes itself in deep pondering silence. It is broken up by rushing themes that spark the imagination as to the sounds of industrialization. The score to There Will Be Blood is equally gripping and terrifying. The pounding sounds herein mirror the march of progress. From the slow thudding pulses of noise to the hectic insanity of big business. Composer Jonny Greenwood delivers a wholly original composition for you. I found it flows over you to push you into the air like one of Plainview's oil geysers.\n\nI recommend There Will Be Blood for anyone that can stand weighty movies in run time and themes. There is a great story here if only Anderson had cut it down some. I still enjoyed the film and found it fascinating all the while. Give it a chance if you can stomach the blood promised in the title.",

            "content": "Strengths: Any conversation about this film must start with Daniel Day-Lewis. He plays the lead, Daniel Plainview, and gives one of the best performances of his entire career. When you think about how storied his time as an actor has been, you understand what that kind of praise means. He completely becomes Plainview to the point where you almost forget he's acting. He totally lacks empathy and or any kind of likable qualities, yet the performance is so good, he works as a protagonist. Paul Thomas Anderson does a wonderful job showcasing capitalism in this era and crafting an intense feature film. The cinematography is top notch. There's also some strong performances outside of DDL that people may overlook. Paul Dano (Paul and Eli Sunday) pulls double duty and handles both roles with care, while Kevin J. O'Connor (Henry) is strong as Plainview's supposed half-brother.\n\nWeaknesses: One thing that usually makes a film work is a character arc. We want to go on a journey with our character where they grow from start to finish. Plainview gets more wealthy and greedy as time goes on, but doesn't ever seem to learn anything. He drives everyone away, including his son. The film ends on a weird note. Daniel murders Eli in his bowling alley, clearly a wealthy man now, and that's it. It doesn't feel like a complete film, despite running at a very long 158 minutes. \n\nOverall: It's widely considered to be some sort of masterpiece, but I just didn't see that. It's very good. It just seems to lack the kind of character development that classics should have. Plainview seems to have one motivation and that's it. The ending is also weak. However, it's a must-see movie purely for Daniel Day-Lewis. He is scary good in this role and it needs to be experienced.",

E' anche un film intelligente, riflessivo, che prende il suo tempo per dare un messaggio e dire qualcosa. Non lo fa con metodi convenzionali, banali o facili da capire: è necessario un intenso sforzo da parte dello spettatore per elevare l'esperienza al massimo. Daniel Day Lewis ci regala l'interpretazione migliore della sua carriera, e forse una delle migliori della storia, le sue espressioni facciali e l'intensità della sua recitazione hanno dell'incredibile.

What we have though, is an extremely intelligent character study on an individual who is the definition of corrupt. Whilst mining silver, Daniel Plainview discovers an abundance of oil and rapidly starts his own oil extraction company. Success, money and power skews his moral compass as he slowly becomes one of the most unlikeable movie characters I've ever seen. He would do pretty much anything to maintain his company, much like any extreme tycoon enterpriser. Murder people? Definitely. Charm landowners to only then deceive them the next minute? Yeah, why not. Abandon your own son? Whoa now, a step too far. A subtle darkly comedic undertone surrounds the film, particularly with the theme of faith. Mind you, it becomes clearer during the final act where he repeatedly provokes someone into shouting \"I am a false prophet!!\". Whilst the narrative is savage and depressing, simultaneously the visual imagery is just as relentless. The scene where the oil well is accidentally set alight was a beautiful mess. I was entranced. I don't think prospecting or mining is a career I would want to pursue after watching this...! Daniel Day-Lewis deserved that Oscar, he was phenomenal. Yet another transformative performance. Felt sorry for Paul Dano who was excellent but completely overshadowed by Lewis. The musical score was abrupt yet fitting, really admired it. The film did slow down during the second act where Plainview meets a long lost relative, but picks up again in the third act. This deserves the critical acclaim, and perhaps with future viewings it will get the perfect rating. Cements Daniel Day-Lewis as one of the best actors ever.",

Emotionally cathartic for every moviegoer who frets about the ills of the world but demands allegory for comfort's sake.\n\nWhen I first saw Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood, I was annoyed. Annoyed at the abrupt final act, and annoyed at Daniel Plainvew's life. Then I realized, about a day later, this was American filmmaking at its ballsiest. Daniel Plainview is a magnificent caricature of American values, and his 19th century industrialist disdain for human life, is somehow the perfect embodiment for 21st century selfishness. He is what we are, what we will become, and what we fear the most. The movie itself forces us to consider our own personal dichotomy of religion and faith (through the hypocritical Eli character) and materialism. Whichever you choose, you lose your soul.\n\nWhat I Learned: I am embarrassed to admit that I really relate to Daniel Plainview. I know I shouldn't but I do. His lack of attachment to people, his burying himself in a profession that doesn't \"love\" anyone, and his mistrust of everything except what his own hands can reach was a terrifying vision of what a naturally anti-social person can easily turn into. In art and in life, I am always running from Daniel, the definitive peak of decadence that you never want to reach, as an artist who strives to inspire people for the betterment of humanity, and as a human being who must always love people more than life experience.

I think the standard line on this film that portrays Plainview as a monster is an oversimplification of what's actually on screen.  Plainview is a deeply flawed man, but he is the protagonist of this film.  The notion that he just uses his son H.W. as a puppet to sell himself isn't supported by what's in the film.  Plainview does have human connections ... to his \"son\", his \"brother\", and to the people he does business with.  That he loses them all due to his drive for success at all costs and ends up alone and mad marks the film as a genuine tragedy.  That his final confrontation with the film's true villain, Eli Sunday, erupts in violence and the titular blood marks it as a cold, ruthless satire too.  This is a roaring monster of a film.",

Usually it's only the middling movies where I struggle to have the passion to articulate much about the experience. Well, There Will Be Blood is a film that I absolutely loved and by all rights I should be overflowing with words to describe why, yet I'm having trouble pinpointing what it was that made me so passionate about it. I think it's pretty obvious that one thing that makes it special is the stunning performance from Daniel Day-Lewis. There's so much depth to the character of Daniel Plainview that I never knew what to expect next. It felt like at any moment he could reach across a table and stab the person he's talking to in the neck, or just as easily embrace them with an insincere hug. The plot of the film perfectly shows how passion and determination shaped this character, and how he could either have great success or great failure because of his pride. At first I was put off by Paul Dano in the role of the young pastor who makes Daniel's life more difficult. But, as the film progressed, I saw how his baby-face and grating personality would be perfect for someone who stands in Daniel's way.\n\nSo many of the moments in There Will Be Blood are the kind of things that I would ordinarily hate. It is slow-moving and long, the plot is not unique or complex, and most of the characters are completely unlikable. Yet I was absolutely mesmerized by this film. The cinematography was perfect, the music set a great tone, the dialogue was sparse but always meaningful, and so much was going on in the characters' heads even when no words were spoken. The ending might be one of the most intense and unexpected ways to conclude a film that I can imagine. Even though I have heard certain lines of dialogue from that scene before, I didn't realize the context and they mean nothing until you hear them delivered by Daniel Day-Lewis. When it was done all I wanted was to know what happened next. They left me wanting more, and yet also resolved everything that the film had been building towards. I think all movie fans should give There Will Be Blood a chance. It is a movie that resonated with me in ways I never would have expected, and in my opinion it probably should have won against The Departed for Best Picture.",

            "content": "Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood is an intense drama focused on the conflict between ruthless capitalist Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and egotistical preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). On the surface the film is about an early 20th century oil prospector building his wealth in Southern California. However the film's themes and subplots go far deeper, exposing a highly complex story about family, business, religion and human nature. It is a thought provoking masterpiece of filmmaking that stayed with me after the end credits and seemed to improve the more I considered and reflected on it.\n\nThe most striking and obvious talking point of the film is Daniel Day-Lewis' performance, which rightfully won him an Oscar. His manages to shift from terrifyingly intense to unnervingly quiet from scene to scene. Day-Lewis brings the most out of Anderson's writing with expert delivery packed with emotion. He also brings an incredible physical element to the role in the subtle ways he demonstrates power with his walk, the way he holds himself in scenes and his piercing, ever present gaze. He effortlessly coveys the character's ruthlessness and detachment from others, and adds a feeling of tension whenever he's on screen. However Paul Dano is by no means overshadowed as he delivers a powerhouse performance as Eli Sunday and his brother Paul. Like Day-Lewis he can shift from almost maniacal preaching to calmness resulting in a similar unnerving feeling. It is a shock that he was not even nominated for best supporting actor at the 2008 Oscars as it really is effortlessly brilliant. It is also worth noting Dillon Freasier as Daniel Plainview's son, HW. Despite his young age he gives a talented well-rounded performance that results in a convincing and hugely important father son relationship.\n\nThe real star of the film however is Jonny Greenwood's score. It is continuously ominous and foreboding, giving every scene an air of threat. It almost feels like a score for a horror film which, combined with the tense performances and complex writing, gives the film an element of real life terror. The power of the score means that even when it isn't in a scene you still have the intensity due to the way it builds up, making the silences feel like everything is coming to a head. The climactic scene removes the background music, allowing Day-Lewis and Dano to really hit home. Combining this score with Robert Elswit's beautiful cinematography really drives home the brilliance of this film. Elswit uses reasonably lengthy takes to capture the performances, and epic wide shots to capture the astonishing scenery. The film's big action moment, where oil shoots out of the ground to create a towering inferno, is a work of cinematic art.\n\nOverall There Will Be Blood boasts everything needed to create the perfect film. Incredible writing, complex characters, award winning performances, an astounding score and expert cinematography. It delivers a realistic, yet often terrifying, story that will make you think. A true masterpiece.",

And sometimes its very good. And sometimes you watch something and afterwards you think to yourself,  'WOW, what did I just watch?!'\n\nThis is such a movie. \n\nTHERE WILL BE BLOOD. I'm not sure how to describe it, really. It's a gritty period piece starring the incomparable Daniel Day Lewis as an oil man who basically shits on the world to become a filthy-rich tycoon. Really, that is the gist of the movie lol. But dammit, there is SO much more going on here! How to describe it?? I really don't know. It's a peculiar movie and a bit bizarre. It has quirky characters and an odd sort of script. But....there is something undeniably timeless about the man called Daniel Plainview that held my attention for 2 hours and 40min. Plainview represents the relentless pursuit of capitalism and the ruthlessly dark ether that can exist in humanity. Not exactly a bad person but he does evil things. Nowhere close to a saint, but he is savior to many. Plainview is a conflicted character to understand but thoroughly engaging....\n\nHe has a young orphan son. He meets some backwoods young man who offers up his family land. He meets the guy's brother - who is a wannabe spiritual leader. He butts heads with Big Oil corporations. He forges an oil empire literally though blood, sweat, and tears. And some treachery happens. And some other offbeat shit. And just treating people like crap to achieve his goals lol\n\nI wish I could tell you more but that IS the story. THERE WILL BE BLOOD unfolds as a slow burn that never exactly explodes into anything major - but still leaves a blister. \n\n I mean, some things DO happen during his oil triumph but without giving anything away all I can say is - watching this movie is watching RIDICULOUSLY great acting. Day-Lewis as Plainview is a force nature. He simply carries this film like watching destructive power take place and you don't want to blink an eye. His presence is such that he elevates all the supporting cast around him. I found myself sitting on the couch watching him ACT, just....ACT, for nearly 3 hours. It is a tour-de-force of character study. It is seriously some of the best acting I've ever seen.\n\nThere is nothing outrageously awesome. No hardcore action. No laugh out loud comedy. No tear-jerking moments. Hell, there aren't any big name people in this movie (save Day-Lewis) but DAMN if it isn't one of the best movies I've ever seen!\n\nMaybe I'm exaggerating because it's a Paul Thomas Anderson movie and Anderson made one of my Top Twenty movies of all time? (Boogie Nights, a masterpiece). I don't think so. I never planned on watching this movie in the first place, but ever since I 'accidentally' saw it? - I've since watched the entire movie two more times.\n\nHere is the catch: I don't recommend this movie to anyone. THERE WILL BE BLOOD is that rare, polarizing film that has no middle ground. A movie so grand and ambitious in scope it leaves you drained. Good or bad. You either absolutely love it, or dismiss it completely. It has no gray area. Those of us who enjoy it will herald it as an amazing movie. And then there is everyone else lol\n\nWatch it if you want, I really don't care. I absolutely loved it.",

What bugs me, is how that story is told: This is one of those movies where a great deal of attention is put into the cinematogrophy, and for whatever reason, the director decided to shy away from too much dialgue. This leads to long stretches where not too much happens, when something does it's epic no doubt., but it seems there is way more downtime than there is uptime. \n\nLike I said though, some people will absolutely dig this film, if you are the type of person who enjoys movies such as Road to Perdition and Days of Heaven than this will be right up your alley. Also worth mentioning is Johnny Greenwood's, of Radiohead fame, score, which definitely increases the tension. If its for you, you'll love it, but it's an acquired taste.",

It's like they dropped the score from a horror film into what is a fairly tame historical saga. It seemed to be trying to put you on the edge of your seat to expect something horrible to happen, but it never does. Annoying, discordant, and totally out of place. I kept expecting zombies to suddenly appear. Very strange. Anyway, it was an interesting ride, but it went on much too long. It \"feels\" like a masterpiece, but objectively it doesn't step up and deliver. Nevertheless it's a good movie to get drawn into if you can hang in there until the end.

Ultimately, I think I was a little too young to fully appreciate what this film is really about; and how truly magnificent it really is.\n\nThere's far too much to cover in one review, so here's something I thought about when the film was over. The first thing I noticed this time around that I was definitely too young to appreciate before was the religious debate that runs throughout the entire film, represented by Daniel and Eli. On a character level, the two are both surprisingly similar, in the sense that they are both controlling and both want the same thing - power and recognition - and naturally that causes a rift to form between them. But I also noticed that, along with Daniel's descent into madness comes his rejection of religion; which is for all intents and purposes represented in Eli. From the very first scene, in which Daniel must crawl and shuffle his way back to civilisation over rocks and mountains, it's clear that this is a man who has not been afforded much luck. Any fortune he's had has been gained through struggle and perseverance against the odds. And, as is the same with all people - including myself - poor fortune and unluckiness tend to make one more and more bitter. So when H.W. loses his hearing and all control is taken away from him, any small hope of a bright future is lost, and Daniel loses any and all optimism that he had left. From then on, he is concerned for himself and himself only. As far as he is concerned, God doesn't exist - and if he does, he's not worth following. This build up of hatred and disillusionment over his life culminates in the final scenes with Eli, where he finally condemns any kind of higher power for good.\n\nAs stated, that was just one of the things going through my head after this film ended. That could all be rubbish, but there are so many rabbit holes to explore that I would need to watch the film a hundred times to fully understand it. Part of the reason it works so well is that we can all identify with Daniel in some way or another. Most of what I've just said likely says more about me than anyone else, but then that's what I want out of a film. Masterfully crafted as usual by P.T.A., this marks a turning point in his career as a filmmaker. I love his earlier work (with 'Magnolia' one of my absolute favourites), and I love 'There Will Be Blood', but in a different way. Anderson has stated that there's nothing worse than a filmmaker who won't act their age - who won't grow up. Whilst his earlier films were playful and ultimately more accessibly entertaining, he has matured and developed with this film; which is far more thoughtful and complex than anything he made before it, and possibly anything that will come after.",

Through a fantastic, haunting performance by Daniel Day Lewis, we are told the story of Daniel Plainview. At first, Plainview is seen as a prospector mining for silver and acts like an honest man. When he discovers silver ore down in his well that he dug he starts a revolution of digging for what will become an oil revolution. This movie has one of those plots that you won't fully understand unless you watch the movie. It has an unexplainable plot because of how much is put into this film and it's great! There's so much that is added together to make the plot of There Will Be Blood. There's the schemes that Plainview uses using his son, the conflict between him and Eli, and the greed that takes over Plainview. The movie starts off with barely any dialogue until the 25 minute mark and it didn't even need words to catch interest because the whole time I was trying to figure out what kind of man Daniel was. He took care of the baby whose dad was killed in a mining accident and takes him under for what seems at first the right reason but then develops into slimy business work. At the beginning it seems like it's cute to show he has a business partner but in the end it's just downright sinister. The story takes a humongous turn of pace within the second act when they finally strike an oil explosion which leads to the downfall but ultimate climb in wealth for Daniel. Day Lewis is clearly the best person for a film such as this because he's able to take control of a movie from his performance. This film is so character driven that it's impossible not to admire what he's doing or how he's acting. Paul Dano also gives a fantastic performance by playing the church prophet who gets in the way of Daniel's schemes often. Their onscreen conflicts are so interesting and yet very tame. There's very few moments up until the very end where they physically fight back and forth it's all a mental game of who will be on top in the end. The ultimate wrap up of this film is worth the price of admission. Everything I wanted to happen in this ending happened and it was perfect. It was a 20 minute one on one with Eli and Daniel and this is where the two characters shine the most. This scene of insanity proves how far Daniel will go for what he wants and his income. This film starts off with kind of a hopeful tone and ends on a sinister and dark tone. When a film can throw a humongous genre curveball in there it really shows how far good writing goes in cinema. The one complaint I have is that it does carry on a bit long and that there should've been more of the soundtrack included because a few scenes felt a little bare from a silent background. Overall though, There Will Be Blood has a phenomenal performance by lead Daniel Day Lewis, a great script, a cool soundtrack, and memorable characters. I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE!! B+",

They're both enormously selfish; one wants power through money, the other power through religion. So naturally, they represent two sides of civilization, religion (Eli) and capitalism (Daniel).\n\nI've seen people proclaim this movie to be boring, and I just don't understand those people. Granted, it may linger at times, but there's almost always something going on to hold your attention. From the beginning of Plainview's fall and subsequent broken leg, to his beginnings of his oil business, to his feud with Eli and the rivalry with the competing oilman, to him eventually getting sick of his \"adopted\" son.\n\nEven all of the sideline actors, while they understandably aren't able to get to the level of DDL, they're still damn good actors. And honestly DDL has this strange effect in which he makes otherwise fine actors looks terrible in any movie in which he stars in. This is especially evident in Gangs of New York; Leonardo DiCaprio is a phenomenal actor, but it never does seem like that when he shares the screen with Lewis.\n\nThe ending, admittedly, doesn't really fit with the tone of the rest of the movie. It devolves into a black comedy fest as it reveals the last twist, (Plainview sucked out all of the Sunday's oil years before their conversation). Of course, the entire end sequence offered a whole hell of a lot of quotable lines, although the most remembered and my favorite, is \"I. Drink. Your. Milkshake. SLURP!\"\n\nIt's a fantastic movie, and a definite must watch for ANYONE who loves movies.",

Doheny and Billy Sunday in real life respectively but the plot is a fiction. \nSetting of the original book is 1920s as is called Roaring Twenties but it seams to be earlier up to 1900s in the movie. 1900s was age of an oil rush and it must be something like Roaring Twenties for oil men.

            "content": "Paul Thomas Anderson's adaptation of Upton Sinclair's \"Oil!\" is so very good it is challenging for me to fully express how good it really it. First of all, this is not really an \"adaptation\" of Sinclair's work. \"Oil!\" only serves as a sort of \"springing board\" into the story that Anderson tells. Staring Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano the film follows the story of Day-Lewis' \"Daniel Plainview\" who is first presented as determined silver-minor with a burning ambition to be an \"Oil Man.' Determination quickly morphs into ruthless. His only \"grounding\" arrives in the form of a son who's own father is killed a tragic accident. Plainview's first real threat comes in the form of power-hungry young preacher. \n\nAt it's core the film is about the rage-filled greed of two men. The question is, which of these two men has the most rage to win what becomes an epic battle. In other words, the creation of Corporate America. \n\nThe two leading actors are brilliant, but PT Anderson is actually the star here. Even with a long running time, \"There Will Be Blood\" moves at a fast pace. 2 hours and 38 minutes feels like under 90 minutes under Anderson's watch. The movie is actually a grim satire which is largely concerned as being an homage to Stanley Kubrick. From the first shot and sound, Kubrick is the clear muse here. From the beginning to the unforgettable ending in which Mr. Plainview seems to not only be living in the Outlook Hotel but he appears to even be wearing Jack's sweater. There are no ghosts or surrealism here -- the demon that haunts our protagonist is greed. Brilliant.",

Again, that's not to say I hate it, I just don't bow down to Danial Day Louis.\n\n                      Let's start with the plot, it's honestly pretty original, starting off with self acclaimed \"Oil Man\" Daniel Plainveiw and his rather terrifying insanity.  I'll have to admit, the story's original, makes sense, and doesn't seem forced, but it's not exactly \"Story Perfection.\"   It is, however, not terrible.\n\n                    But unfortunately, the story is almost the only thing about the movie that I enjoyed.  The acting job of Day Louis (which I am apparently suppost to worship) didn't really leave me wanting more, and most all rest of the acting performances given were bland and forgettable.  Save for 1, And to me, that gem of a performance is from Mr. Plainveiw's Son, HW.  He did a great job conveying the role, as well as the added challenge of using sign language for about half of his screen time.  This is especially amazing considering this performance is coming from a child actor of all people.\n\n                  And as for the directing of the movie, it's, similar to the rest of the movie, ok at best.  Although it does have its fair share of intense moments, it becomes very boring at times.  I almost switched off the movie because I felt like the plot was going nowhere.  This is again, not to say the movie was bad, but it just didn't have the power to hold my attention.\n\n                          However, there is one part of this movie I ADORED.  And that was the soundtrack.  There Will be Blood don't have a conventional soundtrack, but rather a collection of instruments used to set an amazing mood throughout the entire movie, from the tensest moments to the the slightly less tense (but still very tense) moments.\n\n                     So overall this movie is not the \"Cinematic Nirvana\" everyone reports it to be,  but, to be fair, it's not terrible.  In fact, I enjoyed most of it, with the occasional stretch of boring-ness.",

The final act is remarkably ambitious, but I'm not sure that the final cut is what the film needed to end on, with a darkly humorous vibe. In one sense, the ending was appropriate, in another sense, I think it tonally needed to end at least on another frame. Also, the score varies between hauntingly appropriate and painfully distracting, which is frustrating. Regardless, the film is staggeringly ambitious. Another high point is the oil drilling sequences through the first half. Rousing cinema right there, and a film that demands to be reckoned with, and asserts itself as a significant work worth wrestling with.",

If the movie ended with one of those twists where the whole thing was someone's personal hell, I wouldn't be surprised. The movie is very mean and angry. It doesn't want to be friends with you, it just wants you to listen. The characters aren't likable, but the actors know how to bring their characters to life. Authentic characters are always appreciated even if they're flawed, or I should say, especially if they're flawed.

As I sat back down in my desk chair after enduring There Will Be Blood, I thought about what I would say in my review. I questioned what I thought were negatives, as I did with the positives. And to help set the mood, I brought on \"In The Air Tonight\", as I suddenly desired the sensual, slow crescendo of the entire performance. So I put it on, and I came to a realisation; the song features a pace and instrumental nature as that of Paul Thomas Anderson's most acclaimed feature. It starts slow and features a relaxing tone. The instrumentation and vocals are both serene and the closest the 80's could ever come to wistful from soft rock. But the song begins to explode in jagged crescendos and percussion beats, the volume, intensity and size escalating, before finally, the song erupts into what it has been building towards for its entire duration; a moment of pure and utter ecstasy. An explosion of anger, adrenaline, power, before drifting off towards its conclusion.\n\nThere Will Be Blood is much in this vein. A colossal, far-reaching examination of the American dream, our desire to flourish, and the conflict between capitalists and those who serve under faith. It is an exploration of our own embedded weaknesses and the reality of our personalities. It reeks of characteristic displeasure, and abuses the viewer for our impulse to relate and accept the protagonist at first whim. It is a discouraging and utterly liberating effort from Paul Thomas Anderson, a director whose capabilities often transcend those of his competitors by miles. His status as one of this generation's most exemplary and consistent filmmakers rivals that of the esteem that is held for directors and screenwriters of the likes of Golden Age directors that include Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles. Both cinephiles and general moviegoers consistently provide acclaim for his dense, intelligent character-studies; films that whilst always providing variety between not only the general cinematic output but Anderson's own pictures, always come back to a multitude of recurring themes, ideas and disparities. These include namely love lost and perhaps even found; the desire for a family; the inner-corruption that exists within any given person, no matter how chivalrous or kindly they may seem on the perceptible exterior, and alcoholism/drug abuse or general indulgence in excess. The latter is generally the most prominent and easily discerned, but the others are always evident with but a smidge of analyzation, though this isn't to discredit the intelligence and sentimental force of his works. That is just to say that their themes can be distinguished, examined and appreciated by nearly all. Considering There Will Be Blood features all these components with great wealth, I've figured it would be best to examine each individual concept within There Will Be Blood that I've listed above.\n\nLove: Lost and Found\n\nThe protagonist of the picture, Daniel Plainview, like many of Anderson's lead characters, is a man conflicted in terms of how he deals with other people and holds relationships with them. His most obvious comparison from another P.T.A picture is Lancaster Dodd within The Master, who features an inability to remain loyal to his supposed friends, or build relationships easily. He is distant to many, and remains inconceivable to many of the strange, weird and discontent personalities he meets along his road. This is until he discovers Freddie Quell, a fellow soul who seeks someone who can accurately understand him. Dodd is cautious, and remains distant to many. Freddie is someone whom he not only feels one with, but can understand on a subconscious level as well. Dodd can manipulate him and play him, but he can also derive pleasure from their talks and discussions. Plainview seeks to manipulate those around him, and his shields are up constantly. He is hesitant to let anyone in without fully analysing their being prior, and as his descent into madness and excessive vigilance continues, he becomes elusive to people around him. Even from the onset of the picture, within the first two scenes, he seems completely separate from everyone. But he finds a soul in need; a child who requires caring, and he undertakes the job of raising it. But it's not that he necessarily has an underlying paternal instinct, but more so that he seeks someone who can be wholly his. H.W, this adopted son of Daniel's, grows up under the authority of his non-biological father, and is manipulated into becoming a shadow of Daniel's own personality and desires. Daniel, a man who wishes to control any situation or any individual, finds the perfect creature to tame and teach; a creature which doesn't yet have any idea of what is right or wrong.\n\nBut as H.W is subjected to a terrible accident that leaves him incapable of hearing, his innocence and single-minded faith in his supposed \"father\" starts to deteriorate. He begins to become aware of the terrifying manipulations of the man he has loved for so very long, and wishes to undermine him in a number of ways. The ultimate spite being that by the end of the film he wishes to leave his father and become an oil miner of his own accord; in practice, become Daniel's own competitor. It is here, when Daniel realises he can no longer manipulate this boy who he has treasured, cared for and shaped for so many years, that he disowns H.W and denounces him as a bastard. It's heartbreaking to witness the inevitable destruction of this relationship, one which brews for many years, but must, as is due to the volatile nature of Daniel's character, come to an end. No matter who Plainview lets in, he is either betrayed, becomes paranoid or is either plain blunt in his distaste for that individual that their relationship is condemned. Either that, or we don't (alongside Daniel) get to truly become close to that character; Ciarian Hinds' Fletcher is a good example of such. As such, Daniel Plainview is resigned throughout the entire picture to exhibiting little love; his inability to maintain courteous throughout any of his relationships with any of the main supporting ensemble of characters proves his reluctance to provoke human connection.\n\nThe Desire For a Family\n\nThis thematic concept is obvious (or is it?). Plainview, throughout the entire film desires a family of some sort. Or perhaps this isn't, in fact, the case; the metaphor is in-and-of itself a metaphor for Daniel desiring a place he can simply fit in. This doesn't necessarily mean he's looking for people who he can belong to, but just a place he feels content within. Although for Daniel, this seems like an impossible yearning, for he never seems fully satisfied with any one location throughout nearly the entire duration of the picture. His arrival at Little Boston is full of excitement, and dreams of a prosperous future, but he enrages people, spites some of the figureheads of the community, and is not willing to provide simple decency in a number of cases. This is not his home, nor will it be his end. Where he ends up at the end of the picture, in a massive mansion, fit with luxuries many fantasize about owning; he is not even appeased with this, and this location perfectly fits his aspiration for someplace to \"get away to\"; something that he states within one of his conversations with the fake Henry Brands.\n\nMaybe it's the journey that Plainview enjoys most. When he has found a resolution he becomes impatient. He wants a challenge or a feat that requires conquering. Oil is a never-ending, fruitful bearer of prosperity that continues to give and take even to this day. It is not as consistent as, say, farming wheat, and it provides competition for all those involved. It is a relentless and compelling practice that maintains Daniel's will to live, for without the consistent drive (as we bear witness to at the end), his life becomes a shamble. By the finale of the picture, his descent to darkness, and his discontent attitude; his lack of love, family, proper home, mean that he is little more than a shadow of his former being. The confident businessmen we come across in the beginning of the picture dissolves, his inability to form connection and lay his possessions in a single place proving detrimental to his eventual state.\n\nAgain, this character can be connected to one of The Master, this time Freddie Quell. He travels abound, his life confused and without real purpose, or so we believe; when the film draws closer to its final act, it is revealed Freddie feels unsatisfied by his path in life, and he diverts from the road that Dodd is setting him upon. He feels liberated once again, and we come to a realisation. Quell will never be satisfied by the kill, but only the hunt. The emotional barrage he had endured within World War II destroyed his capability to draw proper, natural human connection. He is a lost soul in need, swimming amongst the abyss of his own self, unable to find any other to stick with. Plainview is much the same, as despite his attempts to settle down or succumb to the desire to find and remain with a home or family, his own personality dictates that he is unable to achieve such. He will be eternally unhappy with himself and his position, and he must desire for something greater at all stages. He is a man who has defied all forms of relative success, and he needs something extreme to find the pleasure of happiness; the murder of Eli is a prime example.\n\nInner-Corruption\n\nEven from the beginning of the film, where the false facade that Plainview projects onto his targets is at its height, there is something that is strangely unnerving about our protagonist that forces us to look at him with scrutiny at the forefront of our perception. Whilst he seems well-tempered at first, his moments of weakness and the various secrets that shroud his character all throughout the picture force us to remain attentive in regards to his actions, and impose perusal on his every move. When Plainview begins to unravel and his moral ambiguity shifts to the foreground of the viewer's attention, this inner-corruption that seemed inevitable from the beginning begins to seep forth. From the second that Eli and Plainview meet each other, it is clear to us that their conflicting personalities and world views (one of them a clear defender of industrialism and the other a stern opposition) will lead to a form of confrontation that may very well define the individuals. Both of them, unrelenting believers in their separate viewpoints, eventually force each other to experience a catharsis of some sort, and unveil the evil and destruction in each other. Eli forces Daniel to submit to the knowledge that he did abandon his son, and that he is a sinner; Daniel admits his treachery and seems to almost become more content with his acts.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Daniel challenges Eli and his beliefs, and deduces that the latter man is a sinner of a bad nature and heart. Despite his attempts to be a man of God, he is capable of succumbing, like any other, to the temptations that humans and men are prone to. These two supposedly incorruptible human beings; a man who initially seems overtly formal and of a tender heart, and a young man of God who preaches about redemption and higher reward which awaits the good in the afterlife; both of them fall prey to the allure of women, illicit substances, alcohol, criminal activity, etc. Underneath the polished and refined shell there is a dark and defining personality that is brought out by these two corrupted, evil, detestable human beings interacting with each other.\n\nIn some ways, of all the people in the picture, Eli is Daniel's soul-mate; a man of an equally ambitious, single-minded pursuit whose preliminary appearance reflects little on his eventual outcome.\n\nIndulgence\n\nThe slow deterioration in Plainview is represented throughout with the quantity of alcohol consumed. As he begins to drink more and more, his professionalism, pride and formality drifts away to reveal the blunt man inside who isn't willing to discount his own personal beliefs for those of any others. This is comparable to Freddie Quell, Doc Sportello, or Dirk Diggler, from The Master, Inherent Vice and Boogie Nights respectively, all individuals who suffered from indulgence in terms of felonious materials and alcoholic beverages, some for positive effect, others less so. Doc's effected state throughout much of Inherent Vice provides a great quantity of the laughs and fun throughout; Freddie and Dirk's conditions lead to their individual imminent demises, Dirk in particular being affected so much that paranoia begins to infect his every move, and he becomes a hollow shell of his former being. Plainview's drinking issue forms him into a recluse, angry at the world for reasons that aren't wholly decipherable. That said, it is clear that he is angry at certain human beings, his physical decline, his place in life and his lack of a partner. He is lonely. His drinking turns him into a solitary figure, an aimless shell of his former self, and so in the circle of life (or the antonym for such), he continues to indulge in his liquor. He is a hopeless being, rich enough in wealth to continue his habits, but poor enough in resolve to stop them. It is an inevitable, tragic tale of misery, from the moment we see the underlying rage that Plainview possesses within himself.\n\nOther Comments\n\nAnderson tells this calamitous story of unavoidable collapse with ease, drifting amongst both tales and dialogues of immense metaphysical weight and pairing them beside general discussion, all of it fluid and seemingly simplistic, the transitions in mood, tone and character arc always subtle. Anderson foreshadows the defeat of his protagonist with scenes featuring great tensity, where Plainview is unable to suppress his irritability with people of an assumed lesser intellect, and gradually builds the importance of these moments to a point in time where it is undeniable that Plainview is slipping into the depths of anger and despair. The story is always paced cleanly; what would be considered the most major of events are given the same kind of significance as something far less blatantly large; a discussion around a table where there is a certain amount of disparity and tension between the individuals partaking is provided with the same amount of screen time as a murder at the hands of our lead character. And where as this could backfire in the face of any amateur director, Anderson effortlessly weaves the nugatory into the consequential, forming a consistently engaging palette of imagery and conversations.\n\nThe imagery in and of itself is typically incredible, though as understated as I've ever witnessed Anderson, his usual visual flair, as depicted in Boogie Nights and The Master most obviously, far less prominent than one would anticipate. In fact, in much the way that David Fincher utilizes POV angles, Anderson seems to almost try and hide his bigger moments of spectacle. Long and arduous takes which last minutes of length (and these aren't a one-time kind of thing; Anderson constantly utilizes this kind of a shot all throughout) flow effortlessly from (generally) behind a character, before following them into a new location or towards a new character or entity. Entire conversations are shot in this way, and it's stunningly executed, but Anderson always seems to be underplaying the significance of these moments. He doesn't want to distract the average viewer from the spectacle of the story or characters, and so cinematographer Robert Elswit's work is both more difficult, and less noticeable (by the way, this understated intention is being applauded by me).\n\nThere Will Be Blood finds issue namely in its score, composed by Jonny Greenwood, and some of its backlighting, which proves distracting and unnecessary. Greenwood's score is a dull assortment of loud, obtrusive, aggressive and overpowering rhythms and melodies, only some of it actually accenting themes, motifs and character intentions that are occurring on screen or are being foreshadowed. It's a disappointing effort, though I can fortunately report that Greenwood's collaborations with Anderson vastly increase in compositional prowess, emotive range and thematic density within The Master and Inherent Vice; namely the latter. All the same, this work is no where near the level required for such an explosive, riveting and emblematic picture.\n\nAll the same, it's hard to deny that There Will Be Blood is an absolutely astounding picture, and one that proves justly compelling for its two hour length. The characters depicted are engrossing enough that I would've been happy to have viewed them for another hour, their plights and declines utterly impeccable. Anderson is of the likes of Fincher; a director who possesses the rare ability to be able to hold an audience member's attention for upwards of two hours with glorious performances, a centred and captivating screenplay, brilliant sound design which brings us into the locations shown (though there was one diner scene where, much like this one from The Wolf of Wall Street, a lack of background sound can be fathomed), production design which further enunciates the realism of the time period portrayed, and cinematography that, in true Anderson fashion, transcends general work and manages to enhance the story dramatically and in terms of scale. This is another spectacle of great emotional power that entrances one and doesn't let go until the very end; one of Anderson's most important, brutal, delightful and harrowing confections to date, that exposes his true potential for extensive and sweeping character-based drama. There is certainly blood flowing within the veins of this rampant picture.",

Daniel Day-Lewis gives one of the best acting performances of all time, and Paul Dano also gives an absolutely underrated performance.

It's a character study of both Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday, and the study is so detailed that you aren't sure who the main protagonist or antagonist is. You have to be prepared to watch this movie, but if you can withstand the slow pace, then you should be engaged 100% of the time.

            "content": "Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood is a sweeping, grand masterpiece of modern cinema. It is a daring, brooding, glorious achievement. This is a film for those who love movies, those impressed by a daring shot, a tense dialogue exchange, beautiful imagery, and incredible acting. The movie doesn't have much of a difficult plot to follow. Daniel Plainview, an oilman, is prospecting for oil, and his greed makes him buy out all of the land around his wells for fear of drainage. He brings his son, H.W., adopted from an old, dead business partner, into the \"family\" business, run by lies and deceit. He buys a large area of land from the Sunday family and sets up his oil derricks, making incredible profits as a town builds up around them. Eli Sunday is a smart young man. He wants money from Daniel for his church, the church of the Third Revelation. A dangerous rivalry erupts between the two of them, and there will indeed be blood.\n\nThere Will Be Blood is not so much about plot as it is about acting, writing, and direction. It is a gorgeously composed film with haunting performances and it features one of the most highly quotable and greatest screenplays in recent memory. The acting in the film is absolutely incredible. The movie rests on the shoulders of Daniel Day-Lewis. He is in just about every scene, and his performance is crucial to the film's success. He is more than capable in the role. His Daniel Plainview is one of the very greatest pieces of acting I have ever seen. It is a towering performance. His gruff voice and exaggerated facial expressions, often of rage, along with his limp from a leg broken early in the film, help him craft a character that is fierce and memorable. His chin is covered in stubble, and a glorious mustache grows below his nose. He is a seedy, greedy, dangerous man, and cares about nothing more than his own success.\n\nOpposite Daniel Plainview in the film is Eli Sunday, the preacher at the Church of the Third Revelation, and I realize more and more with every viewing of this film that he is basically just as corrupt and creepy as Daniel Plainview himself. Paul Dano's performance is fantastic, and he holds his own against Daniel Day-Lewis admirably, even if he does not quite reach his co-star's level.\n\nThere Will Be Blood is absolutely gorgeous to look at. Robert Elswit's beautiful cinematography creates images that stick in your head. He films breathtaking landscapes and striking close-ups with seeming ease. Behind the camera also is Paul Thomas Anderson, one of the best directors working today, a man with an encyclopedic knowledge of cinema and a natural eye for composition. His shots are wonderful to behold. They are often daring. Shots play out for extended amounts of time. Complex tracking shots are utilized for maximum effect. Anderson never takes the easy way out, and he crafts a glorious style and captivating pacing that would have been lost with a lesser filmmaker. He is also great with actors, which is obvious considering the performances he elicits from his cast in this film.\n\nThere Will Be Blood is a movie that is made up of one great scene after another. There are so many moments in the film that I adore that it would be almost tedious to recount them all; it would be best just to watch the movie yourself. This is a film that I cannot recommend highly enough. It is a breathtaking, thought-provoking, incredible cinematic experience.\n\nI may not want to talk about every great moment in the film right now; however, there are four scenes in particular - my four favorite scenes in the film -that I would like to discuss.\n\nThe first of my favorite scenes in the film comes when an eruption of oil explodes into flames, turning Daniel Plainview's derrick into a fiery inferno. His boy is thrown to the ground by the force of the oil rushing toward the heavens, permanently deafened. Daniel cares but is far more interested in saving the oil. The simplistic, primal music. The sound drops out. The long shot of Daniel running with his son toward safety. The cutting of the ropes. The fire of the derrick at night. This haunting, harrowing sequence is among the most breathtaking and incredible in modern cinema history. It is also symbolic and important to the narrative, and in more ways than it just deafens H.W. Plainview. Daniel had refused to let Eli bless the derrick before drilling began. Soon after, a man died while working on it. Then, the derrick erupted into flames. Daniel may see religion as \"one goddamn helluva show,\" but the movie, in this powerful, memorable scene, makes a statement of religion and faith being something more, and that to go against faith leads to damnation and fire and death.\n\nThere is a great scene later in the film in which Daniel, angry at Eli for not being able to use his holy \"powers\" to save H.W.'s hearing, and angry at him for his greed at wanting money for his church, slaps him across the face and throws him down into a lake of oil, covering both of them in the black gold, screaming at him in a fiery rage. \"I'm going to bury you underground, Eli.\" He means it.\n\nIn order to obtain new tracts of land for his oil wells, Daniel is forced to be baptized into Eli's church. This baptism scene is one of the best scenes in the entire film. Earlier, Daniel had abandoned his child and killed a man who claimed to be his brother. Daniel is hung over and doesn't want to be baptized, but he lets Eli force him to scream out whatever it takes. Daniel has to say that he is sorry for the sins that he has committed, and he mumbles after Eli whatever Eli says. Then Eli makes him scream out that he abandoned his child. Daniel mumbles it at first, then looks at Eli in rage. Finally, he erupts, screaming at the top of his lungs, \"I've abandoned my child! I've abandoned my child! I've abandoned my boy!\" He then calms down, the holy water drenching the top of his head.\n\nThe ending of the film is abrupt and shocking. It brutally ends the struggle between Daniel and Eli. Daniel turns the tables on Eli and belittles him, making him cry to the heavens that he is a false prophet and that God is a superstition. Daniel then talks about drainage using a now-infamous metaphor: \"If you have a milkshake and I have a milkshake and I have a straw and my straw reaches across the room and starts to drink your milkshake. I drink your milkshake! I drink it up!\" The scene erupts into violence and the movie ends with a character's head becoming a pool of blood, fulfilling the promise of the title and ending the power struggle between these two greedy, corrupt men.\n\nOther great scenes in the film include a lengthy rant between Daniel Plainview and his supposed brother about cynicism and Daniel's hatred of man, and how Daniel looks at most people and sees nothing worth liking. He wants nobody else to succeed. There is a great scene near the end of the film in which Daniel and H.W., returned to him at last, share a meal and some not so kind words with oil executives. The final scene between Daniel and H.W. is dark and haunting.\n\nThere Will Be Blood is a movie about religion and greed. The film exposes certain hypocrisies of religion and the corruption of certain church officials, personified in the character of Eli Sunday and through the point of view of Daniel Plainview. This is a powerful and intelligent film, highly symbolic and allegorical, that exposes the dangers of greed and ambition and the dark side of religion. Director Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the very best of all modern filmmakers. He makes incredible direction seem nearly effortless. There Will Be Blood is a modern masterpiece and an incredibly powerful movie. It resonates with everything that I love about film.",

There are moments when the character feels human with his son and brother, but all he has known is seeing the worst in people, and those relationships become bruised.  Daniel Day-Lewis makes this his movie, and it's fascinating to see.",

            "content": "The most iconic line from 2007-\"I drink your milkshake!\" Paul Thomas Anderson's amazing drama THERE WILL BE BLOOD (2007) does not have anything to do with milkshakes, but that is an amazing line from the movie (if you know the context). The film is inspired by the book Oil!, and tells the story of miner-turned-oilman Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his ruthless pursuit of wealth during the oil boom of the late 19th century and early 20th century. As you can probably guess, Daniel Day-Lewis won the Best Actor Oscar that year... Because he is Daniel Day-Lewis... And he is an acting god. But, I do have to praise both Paul Dano and Dillon Freasier (the latter of which plays the young H.W. Plainview) who gave astounding performances although acting alongside a legend.\n\nI have not seen a lot of PTA's movies, but this was the first PTA film I had ever seen and I could immediately tell how fantastic of a film maker he is. Almost every single aspect of this film was close to perfect and though There Will Be Blood is kind of dependent on Day-Lewis' performance, it still has a great script, impressive music, powerful supporting performances, and breathtaking cinematography to back it up. Granted, the film probably would not work if someone else was playing Plainview, but who cares? Day-Lewis killed it and gave the best performance of his career in my opinion. If you do not know this already, Day-Lewis is the ULTIMATE method actor-he took an entire year to get prepared for this role, and he has done that with every movie he has done in the past. One negative that I have to directly point out though is that the film does not completely make use of its time period; There Will Be Blood could have definitely built upon other aspects of society at the time.\n\nBut Day-Lewis though..... WOW!!! Almost every time I watch a Daniel Day-Lewis movie, I feel enlightened in a way because that guy elevates every film he is in to the next tier and has the ability to transform something good or mediocre to something GREAT or MAGNIFICENT! He always becomes the character; I never see a shred of Daniel Day-Lewis in anything character he portrays. And as for Daniel Plainview, he is hands down one of the greatest and most malevolent villains of the 2000s, maybe even of all time. I would describe this person as the literal representation of evil-seriously, that is the perfect way to describe him. Every callous action this man took only further developed his immense greed and ambition. And as I was following the story, I saw that as he kept abandoning his morals and his loved ones, his evil persona kept growing and growing until it became a prodigious monster. Those final scenes between Plainview and an older H.W., and also Plainview and Eli were spectacular and showed the transformation Daniel Plainview had undergone! He is already so malicious at the beginning of the movie, yet he had become one hundred times more corrupt by the end. And of course, the \"I drink your milkshake!\" scene-that completed the ascension of Plainview from an insane, but intelligent, business man to a LEGENDARY VILLAIN.\n\nBut as great as he is, I have to bring attention towards Paul Dano who brilliantly played the twins, Paul and Eli Sunday. Dano was awesome in the film, and primarily appeared as Eli. The character is the head of the church in the town that Plainview tries to drill oil from and there are two important scenes in which he performs a sermon: one for an old lady, the other for Plainview himself. And, in essence... He blew me away. Simply that; Paul Dano gave his best and most memorable performance as the Sunday twins. Actually, I'm genuinely surprised the guy is not in more movies these days (he was in Prisoners though, and that was awesome). But I really want to see Dano in more films, he is such a talent and with a resume that has There Will Be Blood on it, he will surely have a long, worthwhile career. On the other hand, child actor Dillon Freasier was a revelation. He barely has any lines in the film, but he is still standout and held his own against Day-Lewis. Unfortunately, Freasier has not been in any other movies since and had passed on some other roles offered to him at the time, so I'm suspecting he will not go back into acting. That makes me sad because I truly thought there was a possibility to see him in more movies and to see him develop into a greater actor-he had a lot of potential.\n\nNow the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood are astounding! This is actually the same for every PTA movie-they are all BEAUTIFUL FILMS! Roger Elswit's cinematography and Jonny Greenwood's phenomenal score are a large part of why the movie is so damn great. The film has a lot of scenes in which the majority of the scene is mainly one shot focused on a person's face (primarily Daniel). It never switches to different angles of that person or of the other people in the scene. Surprisingly, I was captivated the entire time though it was just one head filling the screen instead of a large variety of shots; I personally feel as if PTA was trying to make sure that in some of those scenes the film was contributing to Daniel's intention for all the attention being drawn towards him and staying with HIM. One of my favorite scenes in which Greenwood really has a chance to explicitly utilize his score and elevate the scene was the scene in which the oil at one of Plainview's wells had caught fire (again) and it sends everyone into a frenzy. If you've seen the movie, then you know how awesome the music of that scene is.\n\nI keep having to come back to the milkshake scene though. I mean it when I say that was the most iconic line of 2007, probably the most iconic scene too. It is just so freaking unforgettable and it defined the film. Every time I have a milkshake now, I immediately think of Daniel Plainview, which is not necessarily great since he is such a cruel and wicked character. He is badass villain in general though. Everyone should go see There Will Be Blood. There is no point in watching the milkshake scene unless you know the context, right? Overall, it is an astounding movie nonetheless and is definitely worth watching - 9.7/10",

Still afflicted with Oscar fever, I followed up my viewing of The Reader with There Will Be Blood, which won Daniel Day-Lewis an Oscar for Best Actor last year.\n\nGritty, cold and, at times, cruel, this period piece set in the late 1800s through the Great Depression, There Will Be Blood is, at its core, about the business of...well, business, versus the business of salvation. Neither are proven to be better, or worse, as the case may be, than the other except for maybe, in the end, Daniel Day-Lewis' character is shown to be more exact in his evil, while his moral counterpart, Eli, is shown to be naive in his selfishness.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson continues his track record of unique and heavily character-driven films, in the vein of Boogie Nights, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. As usual, his characters are immensely flawed and capable of the most atrocious of actions. He's quickly becoming a master of creating characters who actually do what only our darkest moments think of doing, if then.\n\nAs usual, Daniel Day-Lewis is outstanding in his role, commanding immense strength on the screen. The Oscar was well-deserved.\n\nMy only real criticism of the film is that the portrayal of Eli's religious con-man being made into the weak, whiny hypocrite that he becomes, comes across more as a personal indictment of Anderson's rather than an necessary element of the movie, specifically Eli's senseless murder in the end. Unlike the seemingly objectivity of The Reader, There Will Be Blood shamelessly overexaggerates the stupidity of the congregation (and, believe me, I cannot believe I'm saying that since I generally believe Christianity to be silly). If Eli is proven to be a great fool, what then of the congregation who put such faith in him? It rubbed me the wrong way, but didn't make me enjoy the film less. Perhaps portraying Daniel as an empty, soul-less man is meant to counter the naivete of his enemy.",

It has the same disturbing subtleties too it that draws the story to a sudden climax that both puzzles and shocks. If you do not like PTA movies you will more than likely not like this movie. \n     One of the most wonderful things about this film is how intense it is.

His performance of Daniel Plainview is often said to be his best ever...though I disagree. I loved bill the butcher a lot better. Though it's neck and neck. This movie however is a lot better than gangs of New York. Though I loved gangs of New York, the story in this one was off the charts. It's tense, frightening, bloody, and everything I want in a movie. The movie also isn't bogged down by cliches and I can't really describe the tone of the movie. You'll just have to see it for yourself, which I definitely recommend. \r\n\r\nThe cast is fantastic in this movie, except for the I ratting boy. Though I could agree with him, because his father is clearly a psychopath...I'm just annoyed by some of the things he does until he grows up. Paul Dano surprises me with his acting as well. Giving a great and quite unintentionally hilarious character. Overall the grade for the acting is a solid B. \r\n\r\nThe story is about a Daniel Plainview who loves to buy up land for cheap and make a huge profit out of it. He's a very private man and hates when you mention anything about his son or anything personal. He comes into conflict with Paul's character and hates him from the beginning. This movie tells the story of how capitalism can have a darker side to it with a tycoon who's insane. \r\n\r\nOverall, the movie exceeds expectations for me and by a large margin. Pi wasn't really expecting much and was watching it because people called it a masterpiece...that statement was spot on and is a near perfect movie. 9.6/10",

Fantastically portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis it\nbrings out a whole new type of drama that can be fast when it wants\ntoo, and then goes into complete silence just like that. The story is\nGreat and below I will say why I think this not only great, but also\nwhy it deserves all it's acclaim.\n\nThe story is a fine one and also one you wouldn't just make up quickly,\nIt blends dark tones into parts of the film where they are all smiles,\nbut behind the smiles lay's death and deceit and all the other vices in\na late 19th century/early 20th century. I think although it is quite\nslow as a movie it kind of doesn't matter as drama seeps through and\nmakes this an excellent watch for anyone who enjoys a thrilling\ndramatic piece. Sometimes the endless dialogue can get slightly\nrepetitive and maybe just maybe ever so boring but as the film goes on\nthe words can mean so much more.\n\nI felt the strong hand the director Paul Thomas Anderson used to guide\nthis project was a fine grip indeed and he makes this film glide along\nsmoothly and as if it was a live documentary. We also see his smart\nscreenplay abilities and what he can do and well, it is plain to see he\nis one of those special director/screenwriter people who just know when\na film is this good. I even loved how the film looked with it's vast\nsets and beautiful western USA like town, the supporting cast's makeup\nis brilliant too and I think more shout outs need to be given to makeup\nand hairstylists in cinema.\n\nDay-Lewis is just at his best and for a man with 3 Oscars(for this film\nbeing one of them) he breathes everything an aspiring actor should want\nto be, changing his emotions at the flick of a button and speaking with\na soft but strict tone in this film makes him one of the best ever. I\nloved Paul Dano as the evangelical priest who is against all of Day-\nLewis's ventures and even forces him at one point to repent, the cast\nthen behind these two are fairly basic and just Day-Lewis steals the\nshow. I would have liked to have seen more of Ciaran Hinds in this as\nhis skills are under seen and he appears very rarely.\n\nWith any film that is this highly rated it is hard to say anything that\nis wrong with it as yes, it is slow and most people complaining simply\nfound it boring. The film is dramatic as I have said and indeed is slow\nas I also said but what makes this a so very very good is the beautiful\nway in which Little Boston the main town in the film is transformed\nfrom an average little town to a dark place nearly even run solely by\nthe oil companies. I do think some parts are possibly unnecessary and\ncould be why I don't think this film was near flawless by any mean.\n\nI recommend seeing this film if not just for the fantastic acting\nperformance from Daniel and is a must for all aspiring actors. Seeing\nit also to see Anderson's fine touch is a reason to watch it and if you\nlike straight up Drama's then you will enjoy this, or more be amazed by\nit and it's complex view on greed and anger, and then trying to deal\nwith the repercussions. One last compliment is the way in which you\nhave no idea what will happen next and is a wholly unpredictable epic\nof a film.\n\nA Great film I give it a rating of higher 8/10 of which I felt it was just about\na Great and Excellent film, well worth a watch and don't read too many\nreviews because this film is all about how you found it, not How I or\nany other reviewer's did, yes it is 158 minutes but that fly's be if\nyou are truly enjoying this fine piece of cinema.",

I felt lack of justification for his ways. I didn't see character development as much as I saw portrayal, sometimes almost sensationalistic, of a caricature. It leaves me wanting for something more fulfilling even if I try to appreciate it as is. Plainview didn't fill his stage as sapiently as Charles Foster Kane filled his, in my opinion. But maybe it's not fair to evaluate \"There Will Be Blood\" in such manner, there are other qualities in this work. The acting is pretty good all around, especially Daniel Day-Lewis who plays the oblique main character. I'd say \"There Will Be Blood\" could be seen as an allegory for the conflict between Capitalism and Morality on both personal and social levels. Fortunately, this is a very pleasing movie to watch, beautiful cinematography, fantastic camera work, singular soundtrack by Jonny Greenwood (although a few weird moments).

Having not witnessed his work yet, I was keen to indulge in this particular tale, and boy was I not disappointed. His acting ability is truly something, as he convincingly portrays the inherently troubled oil baron, as his world begins to crumble around him. Unexpected twists add to the excitement, accumulating in a powerful finale. One aspect that I particularly enjoyed were the considerable pauses that focused on our lead, this allowed me to make up my own mind as to what Lewis was truly thinking. Credit should also be given to Dano, who supports superbly; worthy of the nominations he received.\n\nFalling just short of perfection; possibly due to the slightly excessive length, this film exquisitely and dramatically portrays the conquest for oil dominance, whilst implying what money and a greed for power does to an individual. My allegiance still lies with Di Caprio when discussing acting ability, but there is no doubt that when called upon Day-Lewis delivers in style.",

            "content": "There will be blood. And there is. But despite this inevitable resolution, the film of this name is a philosophical take rather than a violent one on the turn-of-the-century oil business. The film, written and directed by the eccentric Paul Thomas Anderson, never stood out or set expectations for itself in my mind before I was able to watch it. Having seen it, it is very polarizing and remains controversial, to both myself and my peers. The basic summary is that an oil man named Daniel Plainview, an Oscar-winning role captured by actor Daniel Day-Lewis, develops a prosperous oil business but rejects his family for the sake of his own greed, leading to his mental deterioration. There's also a bit with an egotistical priest named Eli Sunday, played by Paul Dano. Overall, however, the movie is about deception, and its realistic consequences. On the most obvious level, Daniel cons gullible farmers out of their land so that he can drill for oil on it and become wealthy. Eli deceives his congregation by claiming to have divine powers of healing. Yet both of them fool themselves into thinking their respective ascensions to power are in and of themselves the single focus of their lives, neither realizing the implications of sacrificing their humanity for material success. \n\nThe film centers around Daniel the character, and according to Anderson, it may not even have been made without the participation of Daniel the actor. Though the acting is what stems the vivid display of emotion we see on screen, the motivation behind his masquerades and rants is left to the script, which admittedly has a few holes in it. Plainview lusts for power, but the manners he uses to attain it are vague and unclear: he can smooth-talk his way into the pocketbooks of hundreds if not thousands of Western towns but has more than once resorted to trespassing and other blatantly illegal acts to get what he wants, when he wants. Worse still, the consequences of his sins don't come about until he straight up murders someone, and even then he gets little more than a slap in the face and a stern \"Don't do it again.\" Meant to embody the worst aspects of capitalism in its ugliest hour, Daniel does his darndest to justify his efforts, though never in the least does he romanticize them. This internal struggle, a vital component of many great tragedies throughout history, is confused in this particular case by Daniel the character's refusal to open himself to the audience, even if Daniel the actor is more than willing. Every insight on Plainview's private affairs shows a sliver of evil within him, fostered by the much greater evil which surrounds him and threatens to consume him. One wonders if Plainview was ever good at all, and when all is laid bare at the end of Daniel's life, he has outlived not only his hope for redemption, but also any appearance of obligatory sympathy that awaited his feeble soul.\n\nWhere Daniel seeks acknowledgement in the solace of his immense fortune, Eli finds it in his audiences every week at his Church of the Third Revelation. Eli, in his worldly passion for fame, is stoked rather than tempered by the severity of his devoutness. Daniel, who either tramples on or ignores those who get in his way depending on their level of determination, finds his goal of staying at the Sunday ranch long enough to drill incompatible with Eli's repeated attempts to reform Daniel's personal demeanors. Eli, unable to prove his healing powers when Daniel's son H.W. goes deaf, slinks back in disgrace, envious of losing his ranch to a man even more persistent in gratification than he. In a sense, as Eli abandons his faith to reclaim the money he feels is his entitled right, he reenacts the great Biblical figures of betrayal. First, as Adam the first man, he falls to temptation and loses his Garden of Eden, his ranch. Next, as Cain the first murderer, his anger at God whom he cannot punish boils over into wrath upon the innocent Abel, the name of both the slain Biblical figure and Eli's own father. Lastly, as Judas the Fallen Apostle, he sells out his infinite saving grace for a finite sum of money, only to immediately regret his decision. Daniel's name also holds Biblical meaning, that of \"judgment\", which he enacts psychologically on the priest whose self-reputation is damaged irreparably. All these warped values acting as religious symbolism seem to stand for the corruption of the institutions both Daniel and Eli leaned on for their own sakes; to wit, Eli mistakes his secular desire for divine glory, and Daniel does the exact opposite.\n\nDaniel's greatest sin, despite all his follies of fiscal frivolity, is underestimating the power of his own kin. Entering the cinematic stage without any relatives to help shape his destiny, Daniel reserves the choice to determine those he loves, and it is his own \"judgment\" which determines the fate of his new family. He chooses to adopt H.W. when the biological father is killed in a drilling accident, but this is only because Daniel sees the boy as an opportunity to create an extension of himself. H.W.'s cute face helps convince townsfolk to buy into his caretaker's schemes; Daniel envisions his protege as his most trusted partner, a tool to acquire more money. And when the tool breaks, Daniel can simply find a new one, as he does all the time in his various town-hopping political schemes. One of the oil gushers bursts H.W.'s eardrums, leaving him unable to communicate with his father, so Daniel sends him off to a special school to learn sign language. As H.W. remains an extension of Daniel, Daniel cannot simply abandon his child, but as the son goes to learn more about his new course of life, so the father contemplates this opportunity as well. He repeats this endeavor with a man who claims to be his brother, soon sharing with the newcomer how little he trusts the world around him. Before long, Daniel learns his partner is a fraud and puts him out of his life. It is therefore through the scope of others that Daniel's paradoxical actions can begin to be understood: H.W., the impostor, and everyone he's ever disadvantaged have just as much of a choice with their lives and the lives of others as Daniel has. This serves to illustrate the futility of Daniel's life: what he craved above all else was the ability to control, and he is most comprehensible when he loses his influence and pleas in an empty crusade to reclaim it. In this understanding also lies the film's greatest hope: H.W., despite his disability and the disowning his father lays before him, will not compromise in his resolve to live a happy, fruitful life under his own control. If the film broadcasts to a higher spectrum of those willing to listen, it capably shuns the mess of political or religious theater of the institutions in favor of the more wonderful mess of living life, and sets the denizens who value their human needs over their ephemeral wants on to chart their own destinations. Daniel, none the wiser, simply deceives himself by thinking there is any other way around this inalienable truth, resulting in his illusioned downfall and demonism at the end of his slippery slope.\n\nAs much as There will be blood focuses on the lies and deceit its own characters reek of, it also declares its own intentions clear as day, bypassing the conventional formulaic structure of the vast majority of movies to aim straight for the souls of the audience. Whether it hits or misses is up to the audience, and whether they choose to avert the message of the film. If one is seeking a good entertainment flick, this is the wrong film to watch. In terms of the storytelling, the script is patchy, but the emotion is present and prevalent. The motives of Daniel, Eli, H.W. and others may never be known for sure, but such is the way of life, and it is their choices that reflect who they are, changing or remaining resolute until death. What they choose is up to them, and it is up to each individual in the audience to decide whether they wish to deceive themselves or find the truth of life.",

It's a study on the effects of greed, and how the rise to power can sometimes completely corrupt and demonize the human spirit. Daniel Day Lewis.. it goes without saying, but this is his best performance to date. Paul Dano is also equally amazing, but unfortunately stands in the shadows of DDL. It's also, filmed so masterfully, as if Kubrick rose from the grave. In fact, the whole thing really reminded me of an Orson Wells/Stanley Kubrick hybrid.

            "content": "There Will Be Blood is said to be Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece by many but I think of it as just a good film done by a great director. The film may grow on me in time, as it did in my second viewing, but my review will be based after my second viewing. This is like Apocalypse Now where as I watched it over and over it started to become better and better.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson is a director as well as a writer. His writing here is good but not great. The plot of this film is a miner, Daniel Plainview, who struck oil and became a rich man out of it, he then made it his business to drill and harvest the oil around America. His jackpot was this area in Little Boston, which had an \"ocean full\" of oil, and wanted to create a pipeline to the sea. There is also conflict and competition between Daniel and the preacher Eli Sunday. The film is like a rise and fall story of Daniel Plainview, at first we like him as he is just a poor man with nothing trying to scrape silver to gain some money and then as his ambition and empire grew, he became a horrible man obsessed with greed and power. The story is interesting and at times I think Daniel Plainview is similar to Barry Lyndon. For the most part it was interesting and entertaining but there are small moments where I felt the film just misfired, and that is the scenes with his brother. It is an important plot point as it shows a side Plainview we have never seen but I felt it wasn't executed well. The competition between Eli and Daniel was the best part of the film, to see whether who's ambition would win over the other. Both compete for the community's support either through Eli's faith and sermons or through Daniel's oil that could allow their city to flourish and gain in wealth. The climax is a moment that is driven through with just dialog but it was done really well that waiting 2 hours for it is worth it.\n\nThis is my first Paul Thomas Anderson film and I did have the bar set up high for this film. It didn't meet my expectations but it was good enough for me to want to venture into his other films, in particular The Master. I like the fact Anderson took the time to explore many areas in Plainview's life like his relationship with his son, his past, his struggles at the start. Anderson wanted this film to be slow and patient in order to flesh out the character enough and give us an impression that this man's personality and intentions have changed due to his greed and the crave of expansion.\n\nRobert Elswit, the film's director of photography, has brought his style from Michael Clayton in this film. It takes it's time with shots allowing for performances to stand out more. The film also doesn't try to be flashy or pretty but rather just appropriate in the time period they are trying to create. I think the best moments that was captured on this film was the burning derrick scene. It was done beautifully and gives us an indicator that what lies ahead is not going to be good.\n\nI was surprised to see that Jonny Greenwood did the score for this film. I've only really known him as the guitarist in Radiohead but he really made me take notice in this film. The music is eerie and dark, and sometimes quite simple. I like the fact that the film did not take a grand orchestra kind of feel and decided to keep it light and impactful.\n\nThe acting was one of the highlights of this film. I have never seen a film by Daniel Day Lewis before watching this and he played this tortured man well. The finest moment in the film for Lewis is the climax where he and Paul Dano (Eli) is driven by regret, anger and betrayal. Dano was great in the film, especially in his sermons where he lets it all out. The supporting cast were also good but the focus is really on the main two, and also Plainview's son (H.W. Plainview played by Dillon Freasier).\n\nThere Will Be Blood is a film that needs repeated viewings and requires patience in order to appreciate it. It contains strong performances and good cinematography and also an excellent score from Greenwood. Anderson's screenplay may have moments that I personally do not like but has enough gems in there to keep me entertained. I hope the next Paul Thomas Anderson film I watch impresses me a bit more than this.",

Whereas the celebrated Welles masterpiece's starting point was the newspaper media, Theer Will Be Blood takes place in the early days of the oil business and the malevolent and crooked ways of the leading antihero, the power thirsty son of a gun Daniel Plainview. Paul Thomas Anderson's film is in fact an examination of evil and a comment on the beginnings of the corrosion of society and the corruption of moral standard. Yet, he initially allows the audience to be seduced by the central businessman figure Daniel Plainview, interpreted by Daniel Day-Lewis in yet another masterful performance as he transpires and embodies a deceitful and conniving type of restrained ferocity. On top of the study on the oil business, there is also an examination of the its contrast with religion through the preacher interpreted by Paul Dano. Yet, the two sides do not seem antagonistic, but rather both seem an equal threat. There Will Be Blood is a dark and thought provoking film that deepens and darkens through its pictorial cinematography, meticulous occasional use of visual metaphor and an intelligent and mature screenplay.",

The shots are long, there is very little cutting back in forth, even when there is dialogue between two characters.

Not the biggest fan of it, but it made sense. \n\n*Spoiler*?\n\nMy favorite scene is when H.W. comes back from boarding school and he meets Daniel out in the field.

The cinematography was excellent, being not only visually interesting, but worked so well with the story and mood.  The unique score served well too.\n\nHowever, though it was a very well done film, I don't know that I can say that I liked it a lot.  Perhaps because while the main characters were eminently believable, I was not drawn to them, and was not so engaged that I wanted to know their fates.  Perhaps it's just that they were not so likeable.  Though likeable characters can still be sympathetic; I did not experience this here, and it detracted from my enjoyment of the film.\n\nStill, recommended for those who like intense character-driven drama.",

Also, if you've been putting off watching this movie because it seems like a stark, cold, unrelenting, and long epic of greed and avariciousness from the guy that directed Magnolia, you're on the money. Except those are very clear reasons of why you need to watch this movie. Do it. Put yourself through this. You won't regret it. Also, the performances cannot go unsaid because Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano give 2 of the best acting performances that a movie has ever had. Day-Lewis deserved every award he received because his portrayal of a ravenous, materialistic man (Daniel Plainview) is one of the best acting roles I've ever seen in a movie hands down. Paul Thomas Anderson directs a slow burning character study that allows for Day-Lewis to encapsulate the audience from the beginning. Watch this movie.",

It's hard to analyze this film because nothing & nobody is really black or white, the events are taking place in harsh times, when people were truly poor & desperate and so much tougher than anyone can be nowadays. I really enjoyed the film for all these reasons, it's a tough film to watch, but it's well done, it avoids all the usual narrative cliché used by Hollywood & has it's own special pace, vibe whatever you wanna call it, that makes this film completely unique in the contemporary film making landscape.",

The plot takes cues from assorted Biblical tales such as Cain and Abel and the Prodigal Son, presenting and challenging the notion of faith throughout; disastrous events unfold after a blessing is rejected by Plainview, genuinely triggering the tension between himself and young pastor Eli. \n\nThere are great gaps between dialogic scenes (Anderson conservatively sticks to the \"show don't tell\" rule of the medium) and this is where Johnny Greenwood's score and Robert Elswit's cinematography are truly given their time to shine. But at the heart of the film is, of course, oil; the black gold that is not only the blood of industry but also the source of much bloodshed here. 'There Will Be Blood' is a resounding masterpiece.",

I've built my hatreds up over the years, little by little, Henry... to have you here gives me a second breath. I can't keep doing this on my own with these... people.\"\n\n- TWBB's protagonist, Daniel Plainview.\n\nI remember when I first saw There Will Be Blood. It was about a month after the film came out on DVD in 2008 and my mother and I, on a whim, ordered the film On Demand just to see what it was. Within its first few minutes, it showed us its main character Daniel Plainview, hard at work and attempting to find some kind of trace of oil in the ground. Despite the injuries he sustains, he continues to go at it. This sequence only has one or two pieces of dialogue, coupled with an utterly horrifying and yet strangely beautiful score by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, but it already helps establish WHAT kind of character Plainview is: He is a massive determinator, willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants.\n\nHowever, as the film progresses, this maybe one of the only few positive aspects of his personality.\n\nLet's get this out of the way: There Will Be Blood is not a pleasant film. The title alone should state exactly what it is. It's the kind of movie that outright shows us the ugliness of people and does not look back. While the film does show some redeeming qualities in others in the form of love and to an extent kindness, we see the worst aspects of people all over the place. Our greed, anger, how we trick others in to doing what we want, deceit, lies, zealotry and quite a few more. Though for all of its ugliness and hatred, its a film that will never leave in a positive way.\n\nSet early 1900's and partially based on the Upton Sinclair novel Oil!, Blood tells the tale of oil man Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) and his son HW Plainview (Dillon Freasier). Plainview, over the years, has set up a successful oil business and doing pretty well for themselves. A young man by the name of Paul Sunday (Paul Dano, who plays two parts in the film) comes to him and tells Daniel that they have oil where he comes from. Plainview agrees to see what all of the fuss is about and slowly starts to bud heads with Paul's twin brother Eli (Paul Dano again), a charismatic but over-zealous follower of Christianity. As the film progress, things start to spiral out of control and explode (both figuratively and literally) for everyone.\n\nI remember what my reaction to the film was the first time I saw it. It was something to the equivalent of a resounding \"Wow\" of sorts, simultaneously wondering what the hell I just watched and yet completely understanding it all. The film also was my introduction to both Paul Thomas Anderson and its lead Daniel Day Lewis, both of whom are wildly regarded as some of cinema's most impeccable talents and it most certainly shows.\n\nFrom a directorial standpoint, Blood has a ballsy degree of confidence from start to finish. The aforementioned opening with little to no dialogue to some sequences with characters violently attacking each other to even those quiet moments between Daniel and his son all have a surprising tightness to them. None of it feels out of place or some kind of mood whiplash. Not a single shot is wasted, either. Every scene makes sense for it to be there. This is a character study first and foremost and save for the segment which cuts to HW in his early adulthood, we never leave Plainview's perspective.\n\nSpeaking of Daniel Plainview, this guy is easily one of cinema's most memorable characters. Plainview comes off as a darker version of a typical Living Legend: His accomplishments, power, influence, charisma. But as the film progresses, his true nature and personality slowly starts to show up: His unrelenting greed, absurd selfishness and finally, his mental and moral decay. Compare his dignified demeanor at the beginning of the film to his crazed nature at the end. But all of this is fascinating and, in the darkest way possible, a joy to watch because of Lewis's performance. There's a very good reason why Lewis won his second Oscar for this. Even when he performs at times laughable antics to harass others, such as humiliating fellow Oil executives or playing along with Eli's song and dance, it still manages to spark fascination. There's even some subtleties to the performance, such as Lewis walking with a limp throughout the film, reflecting that Plainview never healed from his earlier injury.\n\nBut Day-Lewis isn't alone in giving out excellent performances. Paul Dano, as the over-the-top preacher Eli Sunday, delivers a great rivalry between Day-Lewis's character and creates, what I felt anyway, an excellent love-to-hate vibe from him. The actor who plays Daniel's son, Dillon Freasier, does a very good job, adding a small flicker of innocence to the nastiness of the film. An older version of HW, played by Russell Harvard, also leaves a lasting impression on the viewer though I won't say how for the sake of spoilers.\n\nWhile many films of today rely on computer generated trickery for beautiful visuals, its always nice to see some films either go all the way with practicality or do a mix and match. Blood, for its look, went for an all natural look to help suck the viewer into the film's time period. Cinematographer Robert Elswit provides stark imagery and haunting landscapes. The most standout part, which has been used in promotional material, is when an oil derrick lights on fire, setting an hellish tone to the scene and Plainview being covered in oil with a strange mix of horror, fascination and sense of accomplishment on his face.\n\nThe musical score - as aforementioned by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood - is very haunting as well and comes off as something that would fit more with a horror film than it would with a period drama. But considering the tone and feeling of madness that carries the film, it fits incredibly well, especially when viewing it a second time. There's also several excerpts from different composers, such as Johannes Brahms and Arvo Pärt, that get the job done in very fitting - albeit also very dissonant - parts..\n\nIf there were any complaints I could give, there would be two. The first would be some of the acting. While the performances are nothing short of incredible many times over the course of the film, sometimes it can border on self parody, especially with Paul Dano's fanatical devotion and Day-Lewis scenery chewing insanity. And then there's the deliberate pacing of the film, which will irk and possibly divide viewers. This isn't the kind of movie to play in the background while you're vacuuming the house; If you intended to watch There Will Be Blood, you will sit down and pay attention.\n\nThere Will Be Blood has already earned its place in cinema and pop culture due in part to its infamous \"Milkshake\" scene (which is in of itself is a spoiler). Granted, not to the absurdly popular levels of cinematic juggernauts like The Avengers or The Dark Knight. I would even argue to those who seek out the film will be very surprised and maybe even turned off for what they would be in for: A slow moving Period Piece crossed with elements of Psychological Horror story. Whatever the case, even with its darkest of depths, There Will Be Blood will always hold a place in my cinema loving heart.",

            "content": "Here's what makes \"There Will Be Blood\" one of the greatest films of my generation: the audience. This is a movie with no clear driving force or antagonist. You ask some people, they would say that it's a movie about the oil business. Others would tell you it's about a maniacal cult in a starving town. Some people might say Daniel Plainview, played to sheer excellence by Day-Lewis, is the film's villain, being as he does some very villainous things. Others might say that the also impressive Paul Dano's cult leader is the villain because of his deception.\n\nThe truth is that this movie is left entirely up to the viewer, in a sense. One thing can be said for certain though, and that's that every single solitary minute of this film is pitch perfect moviemaking.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson broke onto the filmmaking scene with his highly energetic and potent dramas like \"Hard Eight\" and \"Boogie Nights,\" which earned him widespread acclaim, including a couple of Oscar nominations. But this time around he tosses the viewer into total uncertainty. Character roles aren't clearly stated much of the time. Some elements are never even explained. It's a very ambiguous film with a lot to say, and Anderson tells all.\n\nMuch of it feels like Anderson trying to break down the traditional romanticized view of the \"American dream.\" At other times it feels like him making a grand statement about religion versus faith. Other times he tells us the complex story of a man who adopts a boy as a baby, and the turbulent life that they lead as father and son. To be honest, it feels like this movie is about all of these things.\n\nOne of the most interesting reviews I've heard of this movie was from an older friend of mine who said \"it wasn't about anything.\" Some would say he missed the point, but I don't think so at all. If anything, his eyes are open wider than most others.\n\nThis is also a perfectly shot film. I may even argue that this ranks among the most beautifully shot films ever made.\n\nP.T. Anderson crafted a work of art that rivals nearly all others in my opinion. One of the greatest films of all time.",

            "content": "The second shot of There Will Be Blood features a gruff and dirtied man drinking out of a mug while the wind picks up and a thunderstorm brews in the background. Within the first minute, we are introduced to the dark, isolated world of Daniel Plainview. Over the course of There Will Be Blood's 158 minute runtime, he leaves his indelible mark on cinema history. \n\nThere Will Be Blood, at heart, is essentially a character study. It's pretty much the anti-Citizen Kane. Daniel Plainview is a character so reprehensible, so morally lacking, so irritable, yet so ambitious and brilliant it's hard not to sympathize with his plights. It's interesting to note that the opening sequence of the film shows the audience that Plainview's own hard work got him where he is, and he isn't just some privileged asshole. Daniel Day-Lewis exquisitely crafts a character like none other, and truly deserves all the accolades he gets for this movie. Plainview eventually meets his match in Paul Dano's Eli Sunday (whose performance stands up pretty well compared to Day-Lewis's even though Dano wasn't originally cast for the role), an evangelical preacher whose own ambition matches Plainview's. The character dynamic between the two is utterly fantastic; this includes a fantastic baptism scene that showcases the incredible talent of Day-Lewis. Suffice it to say, the character dynamic is more than enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen during the film. \n\nThis is a film that's short on plot but heavy on story, in the sense that only a few scenes play a crucial role in how the story plays out. This may be off-putting to some viewers but if you enter the film with an open mind, those notions will quickly be dismissed. Most of the success of the movie is due in part to the combined efforts of director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson, who fashions a meticulous portrait of early 20th century America, Day-Lewis ('nuff said) and Jonny Greenwood from Radiohead, whose electrifying score builds a sinister undercurrent to the events portrayed on screen.\n\nAlthough No Country for Old Men (another great film) beat out this one for \"Best Picture\" at the Academy Awards, I still think There Will Be Blood deserves it a bit more. It's a film that is atmospheric, haunting, and darkly funny (look no further than the \"cut your throat\" line and the final scene). It is, above all, a cautionary tale, demonstrating how one's own ambition can ultimately be their downfall. \n\nThat, and it's a fantastic adherent for milkshakes, too.",

One man going from place to place to earn money and to hell with anyone in his way. Movies of this length and onward need to earn the right to be as long as it is, and this movie did. It was 100% enjoyable and Daniel Day-Lewis is the next best thing since Marlon Brando. He really is. I could just say over and over again what an amazing actor he is but I'm trying to sum it up. When things happened to the characters it actually affects you because you're invested in these characters because of how three dimensional they are. \n\nPaul Dano's character could get annoying sometimes but that was the point and I'm not saying it was a bad performance because it wasn't. The music was intimidating and the tone for the movie was just overall sinister, you see at one point an oil well being created and it just feels evil.

            "content": "A true american masterpiece about wealth and ambition and greed. Daniel is an oil man who clashes with a self-worshiping priest when he moves into a barren town  and discovers a gold mine of oil. This film has a powerful message of capitalism and how it destroys a mans soul. As Daniel is driven to succeed and out-compete everybody, he becomes alienated from the human race and even his own son, who is his closest partner and the only true love left in his heart. The film is told by long and wordless\n segments inter spaced with intense long dialogue  scenes. Daniel Day Lewis is fascinating and powerful every moment he is on screen, and he is on screen almost the whole movie. There is a suspense and horror quality to the musical score that gives the viewer and unsettling feeling of a curse being set in motion as the oil industry begins to transform America and eventually the world. There is dark humor sprinkled  throughout the film, especially in the films conclusion, where he has his final confrontation with the \npriest. Lets just say that the title There Will be Blood, has many contexts. It is both a religious fire and brimstone title, and a title for black blood, the blood of the earth, and a title for human blood as well! This film is one of the greatest works of art ever made, right up there with classics like Gone with the Wind, I loved it!",

            "content": "There Will Be Blood is said to be Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece by many but I think of it as just a good film done by a great director. The film may grow on me in time, as it did in my second viewing, but my review will be based after my second viewing. This is like Apocalypse Now where as I watched it over and over it started to become better and better.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson is a director as well as a writer. His writing here is good but not great. The plot of this film is a miner, Daniel Plainview, who struck oil and became a rich man out of it, he then made it his business to drill and harvest the oil around America. His jackpot was this area in Little Boston, which had an \"ocean full\" of oil, and wanted to create a pipeline to the sea. There is also conflict and competition between Daniel and the preacher Eli Sunday. The film is like a rise and fall story of Daniel Plainview, at first we like him as he is just a poor man with nothing trying to scrape silver to gain some money and then as his ambition and empire grew, he became a horrible man obsessed with greed and power. The story is interesting and at times I think Daniel Plainview is similar to Barry Lyndon. For the most part it was interesting and entertaining but there are small moments where I felt the film just misfired, and that is the scenes with his brother. It is an important plot point as it shows a side Plainview we have never seen but I felt it wasn't executed well. The competition between Eli and Daniel was the best part of the film, to see whether who's ambition would win over the other. Both compete for the community's support either through Eli's faith and sermons or through Daniel's oil that could allow their city to flourish and gain in wealth. The climax is a moment that is driven through with just dialog but it was done really well that waiting 2 hours for it is worth it.\n\nThis is my first Paul Thomas Anderson film and I did have the bar set up high for this film. It didn't meet my expectations but it was good enough for me to want to venture into his other films, in particular The Master. I like the fact Anderson took the time to explore many areas in Plainview's life like his relationship with his son, his past, his struggles at the start. Anderson wanted this film to be slow and patient in order to flesh out the character enough and give us an impression that this man's personality and intentions have changed due to his greed and the crave of expansion.\n\nRobert Elswit, the film's director of photography, has brought his style from Michael Clayton in this film. It takes it's time with shots allowing for performances to stand out more. The film also doesn't try to be flashy or pretty but rather just appropriate in the time period they are trying to create. I think the best moments that was captured on this film was the burning derrick scene. It was done beautifully and gives us an indicator that what lies ahead is not going to be good.\n\nI was surprised to see that Jonny Greenwood did the score for this film. I've only really known him as the guitarist in Radiohead but he really made me take notice in this film. The music is eerie and dark, and sometimes quite simple. I like the fact that the film did not take a grand orchestra kind of feel and decided to keep it light and impactful.\n\nThe acting was one of the highlights of this film. I have never seen a film by Daniel Day Lewis before watching this and he played this tortured man well. The finest moment in the film for Lewis is the climax where he and Paul Dano (Eli) is driven by regret, anger and betrayal. Dano was great in the film, especially in his sermons where he lets it all out. The supporting cast were also good but the focus is really on the main two, and also Plainview's son (H.W. Plainview played by Dillon Freasier).\n\nThere Will Be Blood is a film that needs repeated viewings and requires patience in order to appreciate it. It contains strong performances and good cinematography and also an excellent score from Greenwood. Anderson's screenplay may have moments that I personally do not like but has enough gems in there to keep me entertained. I hope the next Paul Thomas Anderson film I watch impresses me a bit more than this.",

Anderson wrote and directed this riveting American fable about the moral decadence of businessmen and common people alike at the turn of the century. This film has a very bleak outlook on past and modern American society; everyone craves only to have money and power, the businessmen,  and also, ministers who cloth their greed in the gospel and faith. And Anderson creates an eerie atmosphere that is ambiguous in that you can never truly decipher whether anything that happens is good or bad. Then there's Daniel Day-Lewis, whose performance is nothing short of spectacular in the way he delves so deeply into the darkness that is boiling to the surface of Daniel Plainview's soul; his performance is one of the greatest in the history of cinema, which only adds one more level onto the artistic masterwork that is There Will Be Blood. Every american should see and want to see this film, because it is one of the most thorough examinations of the heritage that lead us to today ever put to screen.",

However, I believe that there are two types of slow when it comes to movies. There is a type of slow where the viewer is unengaged and bored while the other type of slow is nothing happening but the viewer is in fascination. This film contains both types of slow and it makes it difficult to review it. Overall, I don't think it is for everyone, but if you're a fan of a great performance, I'd go ahead and watch it.",

And similar to Taxi Driver and Breaking Bad, director-writer Paul Thomas Anderson introduces the character as just another person who cares deeply about what he loves. Overtime, we dig deeper into their motivations, their relationship with the world, and discover a frightening, despicable person that we had first tried to love or admire. Plainview is a hero to the working class, starting from nothing and working his way to the top of the food chain. We want to root for him, because he represents everything we dream of becoming. Then we see how he handles his personal affairs, feigning compassion when it is means to the ends -- more money / power. Even in moments where it seems like he redeems himself for his selfish ways, there are signs of deceit, resentment, full-fledged disgust towards anything to do with other people. And again, much like Taxi Driver and Breaking Bad, P.T. Anderson does an excellent job in coordinating cinematography, lights, sound (good grief, does Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood know how to use an orchestra for crawling under your skin without indulging in full atonality), costumes, and makeup (the use of oil and mud to dehumanize characters in scenes is one of the film's greatest strokes of genius), all for the purpose of seeing the world through the eyes of Daniel Plainview. An additional round of applause for Paul Dano as Eli Sunday, a small-town church priest who bears little mercy for the sinners, but enough such that everyone has the chance to be saved. Day-Lewis and Dano each commit to characters whose beliefs are near polar opposite, yet have unnervingly similar psychopathic tendencies. Point being, there are no heroes in There Will Be Blood. Only people whose voices shout the loudest.",

            "content": "There Will Be Blood, directed by Paul Anderson, is a modern day classic. It visits themes that are deeply rooted in our human psyche and exposes them as the insanities that they truly are. It also happens to be an incredibly well made film with many aspects that make it a film worth watching. The aspects that make this a film worth watching are; its impressive cinematography, its well written screenplay containing classic story elements and themes, and its powerful convincing performances.\n\tOne of the major aspects of this film that make this a film worth watching is its impressive cinematography. One of the scenes that first pops into mind when discussing the cinematography of this film is the opening scene in the mine. It starts out with no words or explanation with a simple, sweeping shot as the main character is mining. The screen is very dark and his outline is lit up by the sparks that fly from his pick axe. The contrast of lighting down in the mine is beautiful, and that scene alone is reason enough to continue watching. Another scene that stood out as a prime example of the stunning cinematography is the scene where there was a fire and the oil burst from the well and was lit. Then as the sun went down the only light for miles was the fire. The camera did a panning shot across the horizon focusing on the fire and also showing the dancing profiles of two characters talking and cheering. This shot is one of the best of the whole movie and stands out as an example of startling good cinematography. This film is worth watching because of the stellar cinematography throughout.\n\tThe screenplay for this film also makes a compelling statement that this is a film worth viewing. There are many themes present in this film, however the most prominent and evident one is that of greed and envy. Throughout the story we see Plainview (the main character) engage in a constant pursuit of more and more money. In the beginning he nearly dies in a mine after he breaks his leg on the poorly constructed ladder. However his greed drives him too drag himself out of the mine, through the desert, and to the store where he can sell the nuggets of gold he mined that day. Then he is seen going town to town trying to get more investors in an already booming oil industry. He is compelled by his greed to use his \"son\" as means of making him a more appealing and trustworthy figure. Then he is given a tip on where he can find a desert full of oil. When he looks into this the story and the greed really take off. At this town he sets himself up as a savior to the people, providing them with jobs and industry. While this is true, it is simply a side effect of his desire for more oil and more money. Then a local pastor attempts to bless the well, a power play admittedly, but Plainview shuts him down, his greed and envy not allowing him to let anyone else share the spotlight. However the two most shining examples of the greed and envy theme in this film are when Plainview is approached by his brother, and when his son decides to join the business. When Plainview is approached by his brother he initially accepts him as a business partner. However he soon finds out that his real brother is dead and that this is an imposter. This causes him to envy and distrust a man who he grew quite close to. At this point, overcome with envy, he killed the man he treated as a brother, all over his love of money. Then, later in the movie, his son approached him and told him he had aspirations to start his own oil business. At this point Plainview's envy and paranoia of competition caused him to disown his son. He told him, in a crushing manner, that he wasn't even his son, that he had just used him to get investors. At this point we see the true extent of Plainview's greed. He would disown his own son simply over fear of competition. The deep resonating themes of greed and envy that take part throughout this well written screenplay make this a compelling film and one that is well worth watching.\n\tThe powerful performances in this film are one reason that this film is worth watching. Two of the most outstanding performances in the film are by Daniel Day-Lewis as Plainview and Paul Dano as Eli Sunday. Daniel Day-Lewis brings a breathtaking and powerful performance to the screen as per usual. He is at once a charismatic leader and entrepreneur and a paranoid, greedy, cruel, and calculating tycoon. He plays each side of this coin so well, with his rage fueled rants causing shivers down the spine. And yet at the same time he manages to pull us towards him, as a rather quiet but polite and tactful businessman with a vision for a brighter future. This side of him hides his true character though. And Day-Lewis plays this so well that the viewer is altogether convinced that he truly is an oil-man from the olden days, as opposed to a big Hollywood movie star. Then there is the understated performance by Paul Dano. He plays a preacher for a small town, who is so self-righteous that he views himself as a modern day prophet, even going so far as to attempt to heal people. His performance is incredibly compelling due to how much it makes you hate and detest his character. It makes you see Plainview as the inspiring hero character, which is impressive considering how many reprehensible acts we have seen performed by him. He plays a weasel of a man, who seems to inspire people religiously, but at the same time seems to have no redeemable qualities. His performance embodies a character that manages to make the audience truly hate him. There is no recognition of the actor beyond that of the character Eli. We don't see him as an actor playing a role, he is Eli and we hate him for it. It is the fantastic portrayals done by actors in this movie that make it such an interesting, and rich film and that make it a film worth watching. \n\tIn conclusion There Will Be Blood is a rich, well-woven film that is worth watching. It hits on so many deep-set and primal emotions while at the same time causing the audience to evaluate themselves and ask if they too are as greedy and envious as the main characters. The lush cinematography, the powerful themes of the screenplay, and the convincing performances by the actors make this a film worth viewing. There Will Be Blood embodies its ominous title and delivers on its promise as it makes its way through its tension filled 158 minutes. It truly is a film worth spending the time on, the two and a half hours could not be better invested.",

Movie show how he get more powerful, buy up land, try to build pipeline, slap around preacher, get slap around by preacher, almost get conned, and score big deal. But at heart of story is relationship between progatonist and boy he raise as own dat go from beeootiful partnership to not-so-beeootiful so-long-see-you-later long distance relationship when kid go deff and try to crispy fry bedroom. Daniel-Day Lewis give incredible performance likes of which not seen since Fozzie Bear play part of Willie Lowman in off off off-Broadway kabuki performance of Death of Salesman. Veeery gruesome death of salesman. Not sure if same in original play but sure hope so because ritual seppuku very hard to top for entertainment value. Anyway, Lewis give very believable and restrain performance up until last scene when, during milkshake solililquee, he go off like Grover dat time he get short-changed by hooker wit wooden leg.\n\nOverall, very good movie if you willing to immerse self in story. Progatonist self-destruct life and relationship wit adopted son very sad - but end of movie even sadder because just stop all of sudden as if producer say \"Ah, dats enough. Let's go home.\".

            "content": "A film that hits you like a fever, \"There Will Be Blood\" is not the kind of movie that someone will have the pleasure of watching or reviewing. It is a portrait of several layers of everything that comes with the desire for power, will leave the audience feeling exhausted and with a bitter taste in the mouth.\nDirected by Paul Thomas Anderson, the film is submitted safely and confidently. Anderson proves to be one of the best director of all time, a fact that is evident here. Packed with shots and scenes of breathtaking intensity of boiling, the film makes no apologies about his tendency toward grandiosity inherent in telling an epic story that spans decades.\nPerhaps the first thing that will strike viewers will use the images as dark and gloomy, almost impossible to see. We watched the movie as we were covered in oil. Batway, oil is simply the central theme of the film.\nThe story begins with the oil tycoon Daniel Plainview, he is a very intelligent man and cruel that does whatever it takes to achieve your goals. He works hard, but he also takes advantage of the people around at your expense, if necessary. His business partner is his son H.W, that he actually \"acquired\" when the H.W biological father, who worked on one of the platforms of Daniel, was killed in an accident at work.\nDaniel is deeply protective of H.W, but only for that H.W brings to the society, a serene and innocent face. When both know Eli Sunday saying the land of his father has oil everywhere, making an offer to Daniel to buy the imovel from his father. Eli is the local preacher and a healer \"self-proclaimed\" wants the money from the sale of the property to finance his own church.\nThe lives of both characters change completely when Daniel decides to buy all the land outside the property of the father of Eli and tries to acquire all the land around, at bargain basement prices to be able to build an oil industry. And always with H.W at your side to strengthen the business.\nThe setting of the film can be impressive, every minute that passes we see it bigger and bigger. And with it the ominous and annoying soundtrack that fits in every scene, leaving them more disturbing. When music raises the pitch dark, pessimistic and emotionally draining film, without ever taking center stage away from the performances, with characters that prove to be the soul of the story.\nDaniel Day Lewis proves to be one of the best actors of his generation, this film, in my opinion, gives his best performance to date. Daniel Plainview (Lewis) can be cruel, sinister and pessimistic at every passing second, but at the same time can show a little ray of goodness in his evil look; Paul Dano in a fantastic and disturbing performance, Eli Sunday (Dano) is the Movie's religion, amidst all the disturbance and sinister he is the sort of God to want to expel the devil, the devil being Daniel, out of paradise. But throughout the film it all fits.\nThe film is a character study of a man who usually do not want to know and you will not be able to forget after all is said and done. After watching it you will not want to reveal it soon, but it will be for all the right reasons, Paul Thomas does all this perturbation on purpose. \"There Will be Blood\" is a powerful and emotionally draining experience.",

            "content": "It's slow and brooding but never intolerable, in fact, it's performances and aesthetic make it thoroughly engaging throughout. \r\n\r\nThis is not a film for everyone- it's not necessarily on some higher plain that only makes it accessible to some kind of viewing elite as it's reputation may suggest. The reason it's not for everyone is simply it's nature- it refuses to follow rules and as a result is fairly challenging. Not everyone looks for a challenge like that in a film and so to them this is, understandably, not a good film. I love that challenge though and this film gives me plenty to chew into. The performances are brilliant, the cinematography is brilliant, the themes are brilliant, the script is brilliant, the score is brilliant, you get the idea.\r\n\r\nNone of it is easy though-it's actively trying to push against you, be it through the constantly intense and overbearing acting, the gloomy, thick and honest cinematography, the coarse progression of the storyline, the intriguing obscurity of elements of the script, the total deconstruction of  common themes into their bare-minimum and the very-modern score that undermines the time and place but captures the tone and atmosphere perfectly giving us a challenge from the music to go along with the challenges in this film.\r\n\r\nNothing should be easy with a film this confident anyway but it's so sharp that it draws blood (no pun intended) with the viewer and the result is a feeling that this film doesn't deserve what it commands. If this really is a masterpiece then it's one that's masterful in it's divisiveness- it's a strange comparison to make with such an old-fashioned film but this one is like a piece of modern art. To some it's  more demanding than it is rewarding and to others it is so challenging as to be a step ahead of anything else.\r\n\r\nI'm somewhere in the middle but I feel closer to the later belief- this is a successful piece that pushes boundaries and I respect it greatly. That isn't enough for me to love it though, it's doesn't seem to want that- it doesn't want to be complete, it doesn't want to be anything other than powerful. And it certainly succeeds at that.\r\n\r\nI actually asked Jonny Greenwood, who wrote the score, a question in a Q&A for a magazine some point last year. I asked him how he felt about not being eligible for an Oscar nomination for his score due to a technicality (he re-used some music from a previous project of his). His answer was that he didn't care and I think that attitude defines this film- it's commitment to art at it's utmost but it doesn't strive for recognition from it's audience- that's a large part of it's success I'm sure but it's also taken to such an extreme that this film can't be outstanding, instead it has to settle for just being great.",

            "content": "Paul Thomas Anderson's previous works, for me, have suffered from a lack of context or focus, occasionally meandering off into an irrelevant vacuum where he fails to show character motivation, important exposition, smooth transitioning, and other staples of film. The result is a technically magnificent movie filled with mystifying metaphors and, most noticeably, emotional detachment. Nevertheless, PTA's unique style boasts incredible talent, and There Will Be Blood is the quintessential Anderson at his best. Most pleasing is the incredible originality of the film - set in 1898 - early 1930s, it acquaints the viewer with Daniel Plainview, a man driven by an insatiable greed and boiling with hatred. Daniel Day-Lewis' oscar for this role was well-deserved. Plainview is both terrifying and utterly charming, a peculiar craft of man who confides in no one and lives a life of grinning manipulation and pseudo philanthropy. He is magnificent to watch, from beginning to end, and Anderson's particular breed of machinations gels so well in this instance that we are left simultaneously astonished at Plainview's unraveling brutality and utterly unsurprised at his inhumanity. Further increasing the movie's score is the breathtakingly gorgeous cinematography - it provides a sense of decidedly personal perspective in the time period, moving with the characters instead of rooted in one spot like other films, lingering on filthy hands straining to lift up coarse, coiled ropes. The effect is so pervasive that it feels like a novel is unfolding in visual format onscreen - also impressive are the short bursts of intense violence, neither exaggerated nor sugarcoated, but exactly true to the event. Contextually, it's all flawless. The film has the most uncanny ability to seize you and positively nail you to your seat. Everything just works, and I personally never thought such a long, slow movie about oil could be remotely interesting. And yet it is. You can smell the coveted black gold; you can catch the subtle glint of triumph in Daniel's eye as he makes his modest speeches, and likewise the fiery glare, almost ethereal in its atomity, but undeniably present. All the supporting cast is top-notch, too; while this is ultimately a film about Daniel, and Daniel alone, Paul Dano delivers two terrific performances as Paul Sunday and Eli Sunday, identical twins. Anderson clearly knew what he was doing this time around. The casting, acting, storytelling, cinematography, and sound mixing are all phenomenal. There Will Be Blood can do something not many movies can ever do: it fully has my permission to call itself an instant classic. Rarely ever do films mix such a starkly demoniac combination of emotional turbulence and slow-paced storytelling.",

This film was beyond exceptional, aesthetically, story wise, and acting of course. My most favorite element of the film was the camera work and movement that Paul Thomas Anderson has created in this film. Throughout all of his films I am the biggest fan of his steady camera work and the tension, movement, and emotions that he can convey through this. Most of my favorite shots are his wide establishing shots that are so breathtaking, not a hair out of place, and convey so much through that. The film that I immediately thought of was The Master, with those huge shots of the ocean, the islands he was on, the streets he walked down, and how they were so vibrant. At the same time though, they retained their film and weathered look to counter balance the vibrancy, and giving you a sense of history or age even within the film stock choice. Combined with Mr. Lewis' acting, which was beyond amazing and close to his performance in Lincoln, it made for such a fantastic film. He seemed so engrossed in his character, and did not show one once of himself through the character but conveyed only Daniel Plainview. Many actors tend to play parts that play into their own personalities and selves, although with Daniel Day-Lewis he is far above any actor I have ever seen. He is able to break away from himself and actually become the characters that we see him play. With all that said, this film I would consider to my favorite of Paul Thomas Anderson's films.",

The special edition has him looking from above. The cover is shadowed by black, white, and gray. I was bound to see this film some day. An accomplishment in cinema, There Will Be Blood. Director Paul Thomas Anderson brings us a film about man vs man, internally and externally, where big business takes on cult religion while soaked in oil. Based on the novel by Upton Sinclair, There Will Be Blood is a visual stunner and loaded with great performances from Daniel Day-Lewis, Kevin J.Connor, Paul Dano, and Dillion Freasier. Day-Lewis plays a Plainview, a man who becomes a wealthy business owner dealing with oil. During a job, he adopts a young toddler after his father dies in an accident. The boy H.W. becomes his partner and a mascot to convince the people that he is \"family man.\" Daniel is then met by a young man named Paul who informs him about oil in his family farm. There he is encounters Paul's twin brother Eli who haggles with him when Daniel attempts to purchase the land. Eli is the pastor with devoted followers in a small church in Little Boston, California. Tension grow between the two and problems continue to grow for Daniel who is becoming wealthier and cynical. His life may gone off the rail when a stranger claims to be his brother. Yet, I doubt things will get easier for Daniel. There Will Be Blood is an exciting and fantastical film which mostly focuses on one man and his surroundings. Some will complain the film's lack of a strong female character which a little girl comes close. There is not a lot about workers in the film other than seeing a few scenes of them working and walking around. According to Anderson, there was a great deal of difficulty in trying to adapt Sinclair's novel which was great nonetheless. Yet, Day-Lewis, Dano, the location, and the events is all you really need to know. I really enjoyed this dark film. Props to the scene where the guy gets whacked and the h*** on earth scene.",

            "content": "may contain spoiler.\nthe following review explains it. I am going to add my own perspective to it.\n-----\nThere will be blood can interpreted in three ways, two of them are inspired by Lorenzo Wang provided below.\n1 - Daniel Plainview is the symbol of God. His lonliness, his power, all portrayed in Daniel Plainview. And eventually there will be blood, as what God did to Jesus. And eventually he is \"finished\": when Daniel Plainview says: \"I am finished\". Implying that God, wanted to be God, eventually there was Jesus blood, and after that, God was finished, he was no God no more. \nThis is the dark view of the movie, looking at the universe and God. \n2- Daniel Plainview as the symbol of man, the power side of man, while Eli is the symbol of man, the verbal God. In other words, D. P. is the symbol of man wants to become the power or practical side of God, while Eli tries to become the verbal side of God. Both attempting miserably and both fail.\n3 - Daniel Plainview as the symbol of man. From Adam to future. Dark ending, showing the fate the human. No fate on humanity.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nprovided by: Lorenzo Wang\nAfter reading many reviews of P.T. Anderson's seminal new film There Will Be Blood, I am disappointed to see how much misinterpretation there is. Where the themes of greed, godlessness, capitalism, hatred, and revenge are certainly present, they are peripheral, and recent oil politics have led critics to miss a central theme that ties all those issues together: the loneliness of godhood. I will explain the four different meanings of the film's title to show that that loneliness is what drove anti-hero Daniel Plainview to his tragic end.\n\nA Hopeless Perspective\n\nDaniel Plainview is a complex character, and for reasons not entirely clear, we know that he is exceedingly mistrusting. But we should begin with his name. The surname \"Plainview\" describes this lack of trust. He can't or won't try to see deeper into people. He says \"I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need,\" and considers people commodities, not comrades. Pride in his own ability leads him to hate other people's incompetence, which he can't stop himself in finding in abundance in all men. When he looks at people he sees \"nothing worth liking\". The only exception was a child, whom he adopted as his son, but more on that later. He confesses to Henry: \"I can't keep doing this on my own with these... people.\" He is telling us that doing things with \"people\" he can't trust is a terribly lonely feeling.\n\nHis first name \"Daniel\" means \"judgment by God\" and \"God is my judge.\" There is a double meaning here. Plainview is judged by God by the end of the film, punished for his hubris, but he also subconsciously fancies himself to be a judging God. He screams at Eli, proclaiming \"I am the Church of the Third Revelation.\" He tells Henry that he wants to \"to rule and never, ever explain myself.\" This God complex is important to the irony of the ending, and we'll get to that.\n\nAs a surrogate god, Plainview believes deeply in the power of his words, that things will be the way he says it, because he says it. He introduces himself to the audience with talk of his promises, telling them what he will do for them, matter-of-factly as if saying makes it so. \"...If I say I'm an oil man you willagree.\" A normal person would have said \"...If I tell you I'm an oil man, you'd probably agree\" or even \"you'd have to agree.\" Plainview leaves them no choice; it is already so. \n\nWhen he meets Tilford of Standard Oil, Plainview flies into a fit, yelling over and over \"You don't tell me how to raise my family.\" His threat to Tilford is revealing, as he says \"...I'm gonna cut your throat.\" He will silence him. When he successfully wins the Union Oil contract, he proudly proclaims \"I told you I was gonna do.\" To override Plainview's voice is to override his power, which he cannot accept. It is no accident that he speaks almost entirely in the indicative (and sometimes seemingly declarative) mood throughout the film. \n\n\nAt the conclusion of the movie, the very last words uttered are \"I'm finished.\" It is a sad ending, with a joyless Plainview still vainly thinking he has the power of speech, declaring the film over by saying so, yet at the same time giving us the double (colloquial) meaning that he is \"finished.\" His life is ruined, and he's literally destroyed his future by committing a murder before a witness. He completed his stated goal of making sure that \"there will be blood\" and it has left him \"finished.\" The title and last words (which are brought back together with the reappearance of the title as the ending music kicks in) are incredibly pregnant with meaning and fate. \n\n\nSaying Is Believing\n\nHere we find out the meanings of the title There Will Be Blood. First, the literal meaning is that there will be violence in this story. Plainview can and will kill to achieve his ends. The second meaning is a statement from Plainview, telling us that there will be blood, making it so by saying it. He already has the intention to spill blood to achieve his ends. Thirdly, and most importantly, the title is a statement from Plainview where he is trying to create kinsblood, or family, for himself. \"Will\" means that he is trying to will it into being, making it so by claiming the boy he found to be his son. It is a sad, desperate call for family when we know one cannot just make family by demanding it verbally. This vanity is what this film is about.\n\nHis son H.W. most likely represents the Jesus analogy to his God complex. \"[HENRY] Where is his mother? [PLAINVIEW] I don't want to talk about those things.\" Plainview wants the child to be like him, so much so that H.W. could be interpreted as derived from YHWH, the holy Hebrew name of God meaning \"He is.\" I won't get into the specific religious etmyology of the name, but suffice to say, Plainview wants to be reborn in his son. Predictably, the worst happens to his son: the boy becomes deaf. Plainview has lost all his power over his son, and cannot raise him in his own image. Instead of his voice, he must speak to his son now through actions. As he turns his son away from him at the very end, he tells H.W. that his blood does not run in him. His fairy-tale of being a \"family-man\" falls apart.\n\nThe desperation with which Plainview seeks \"blood\" to ameliorate his loneliness is as pitiable as it is foolhardy. When Henry appears, claiming to be his long-lost brother, Plainview refuses to accept him until the man says he has no ambition, which finally lets Plainview have someone close but whom he will not compete with, unlike his son at the end. He calls Henry his \"second breath,\" and uncoincidentally gets rid of H.W. at the same time he gains Henry as a brother. Although they become fast friends, Plainview kills Henry when he turns out to be an imposter. Plainview can't accept family that isn't blood, or isn't created by his own accord as H.W. was. \"Well, if it's in me, it's in you.\" But it wasn't in Henry.\n\nThat shortsightedness costs him all forms of family. Interestingly, one of the last things Eli says to him before being murdered is that they are brothers-in-law now, just as the last thing Plainview asked of Henry was \"do I have a brother?\" But in the relationship with Eli, his fatal flaw is revealed. One cannot have family without trust. To Plainview, Eli is a false prophet, and he makes him confess so much. Eli also has a gift with speech over men, and Plainview cannot accept that. \n\nThe greatest insult he bore was Eli making him declare he had abandoned his son during the baptism, which Plainview never forgave. \"I drink your water, Eli... Everyday. I drink the blood of lamb from Bandy's tract.\" He had violated Plainview's voice, and therefore his power. Plainview would do the same to Eli for revenge. In essence, Eli is like him, albeit without his skill and ruthlessness. Eli raves at his father, \"Do you think God is going to come down here and save you for being stupid? He doesn't save stupid people, Abel.\" Fundamentally, two distrusting men of competitive hearts can not be brothers. Perhaps he killed Eli because of, not in spite of, Eli calling him his brother.\n\n\nReaping The Conclusion\n\nThis brings us to the tragic irony of the film, and the fourth meaning behind the title. Plainview fails to resolve his loneliness with his distrust, sabotaging himself with the desire for others like him. All the people who could have been family to him, albeit not family in blood, he ruined. There Will Be Blood is telling us that there will be sacrifices (blood of lamb). \"Give me the blood, Lord!\" cried Plainview, but in demanding so, he loses \"adopted\" blood, people who could have been as good as family to him, along with his dream since childhood of building a house filled with children. His arrogance in speaking in the indicative mood to not just get his way but almost \"procreate\" his wishes upon others does not change the fact that he's mortal and human.\n\n\nGod has judged him proud, and punishes him with loneliness. Further irony is found in the fact that the person he judged most correctly was Eli, an image of his own hubris. And yet he's compelled to keep sacrificing these salvations because of his competition, his hate. This is God in a mortal. In the Bible, God gave us Jesus, but in this film, Plainview can not make the sacrifice. H.W. must be in his image, or there will be no H.W. He doesn't love, he wants, and thus fails to achieve godhood. Where Eli is false in God's name, so too is Plainview in God's image.\n\nOne thing I must address is the misconception that this film is about capitalism. Sure, capitalism exists in the movie, but it's not Plainview's driving motivation. Capitalism's emotional equivalent is human greed, as the word itself means the accumulation of \"capital,\" defined as sanctioned wealth or property. Plainview is not primarily a greedy man. Greedy people choose personal gain over personal values and loved ones. Plainview, however, goes out of his way to choose a more strenuous (and dangerous) long-term gain (with Union) over an easy short-term gain (with Standard Oil), inarguably to prove his worth. He also desperately wants to bring someone he can trust and love into his business, to dominate, but also to share with. These are not consistent actions with simple avarice.\n\nWatching the film again, I trust you will find how striking the glorious cinematography captures Plainview's loneliness, from the opening well scene, to the hauntingly destitute derricks, to the shots of empty landscapes and solitary trees. While I'll admit this wasn't a perfect film, and not quite a PT Anderson film even, it is one of the finest character studies in recent memory, pulling strings from Altman and riffing on Kubrick even down to the Kubrickean bowling alley set. There are still many more things to discover in this film, which is really the Citizen Kane of our time not just 'cuz it's fun to make that comparison, but because they are moral tales about falling from trying to achieve some form of godhood. Even while it is unwatchable for some, it is satisfyingly interesting, because there is a bit of Plainview in all of us.",

            "content": "There Will Be Blood is historical satire and lead acting at its finest. It's a movie about a man (Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis) who finds oil and starts up an oil business, later acquiring the location of a large deposit of oil near a small town. At first he endears himself to the local community, but begins to clash with Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), the town minister, and eventually becomes consumed with his desire for money, willing to sacrifice everything for just one more dollar, including religion, family, and his own sanity. There are quite a few things that make this film great. First, it's Daniel Day-Lewis. He's not a typical actor, as he insists on becoming completely involved in his role, such as learning to build canoes and hunt for Last of the Mohicans, and insisting on being referred to as Mr. President, even off set, for Lincoln. But his complete envelopment in his roles pays off, and becoming Daniel Plainview was no different, as he's completely captivating and enthralling, and plays out the developing insanity and barbarism of his character perfectly. The second thing is the satire. It's a commentary on capitalism and its effect on society. It plays this out in multiple ways, including Plainview's confrontations with Sunday, issues with his son, and his developing insanity, while simultaneously also subtley commenting on those other points as well, including religious corruption and family benefits vs appreciation. It's a movie that is sometimes sterile to its benefit, but occasionally does drag, and it's possible that when you first finish watching it you might be confused or not think much of it, but the more you think about it and reflect on it the more you'll like it. Highly recommended.\n\n4 stars: Great",

            "content": "Human behavior and characteristics is a very fascinating field.  Many classic movies tend to use such topics to explore the many pit-holes that human beings can commonly fall into because we are a flawed species.  Many things tempt man.  Whether one resists or succumbs proves one's claim.  There Will Be Blood is one of those films that try to follow the classic movie formula of exploring such vices with a bit of a modern touch.  The result is a lackluster, incoherent, indecisive movie whose message is so chaotically delivered and distraught; I couldn't help but wonder what it was trying to teach and what it was trying to accomplish.\n\nSet in California around the turn of the century, a broke miner named Daniel Plainview accidentally breaks his leg upon striking an oil reserve buried within his mining shaft.  After starting his own business, one of the workers dies in an accident and Daniel takes in the worker's son.  As Daniel and the young H.W. work to expand their refining business, a man named Paul Sunday informs them about a massive storage of oil underneath their property.  The two begin to use this opportunity to their advantage by purchasing the land from the Sunday family, but are met with opposition by the young twin brother of Paul-the young priest named Eli Sunday who requires that Daniel pays $5,000 of his earnings to his church so he can achieve his equally ambitious motive.  From there a rivalry ensues.\n\nBeing loosely based on a book entitled \"Oil!\" by Upton Sinclair and reportedly inspired by \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\", \"There Will Be Blood\" is Paul Thomas Anderson's look at his characters through the issues of greed, business, power, oil, money, and religion.  What follows is a bloated, ambiguous movie with unlikable, hollow characters and a confusing narrative.  There have been many classics that have capitalized on the aspects of human behavior through the aforementioned concepts, but the main problem with this movie is that there is very little substance.\n\nBefore I elaborate on what I just said, I will first talk about this movie's positives.  I will not argue about how well acted and shot this movie is.  Daniel Day-Lewis has rightfully deserved his Best Actor award for his performance as Daniel Plainview.  Paul Dano also delivers a great dual performance as twin brothers: Paul and Eli Sunday.  Many of the massive backgrounds are wonderfully shot on a large scale and this movie does deliver some memorable moments.  Some examples are the disaster at the oilrig that costs H.W. his hearing and the \"I drink your milkshake\" line.\n\nAlthough, I say that this movie lacks substance due to how dull and badly interwoven the plot is.  For a movie that tries to tackle such aspects of human thinking and behavior there's very little that this movie can offer in terms of reasoning.  One of the problems is that this movie seems so caught up in its own style to the point to where it very vaguely, or totally forgets to fully analyze and deliver its message entirely.\n\nI perfectly understand that these characters aren't supposed to be likable and are meant to be corrupt because of their ambitions within their areas of operation.  Don't get me wrong.  Such use of these types of characters can and have worked in such classic movies like \"Elmer Gantry\", \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\", \"Citizen Kane\", \"Gangs of New York\", etc.  What separates these movies from this one is that there was a charm of learning and understanding why these characters are operating within this world, what makes them what they become, and the prices they pay as a result of their methods.\n\nFor a movie that tries to dive deep into the emotions of greed and its correlation to business and religion, \"There Will Be Blood\" doesn't do a very good job at engulfing the viewer into the world nor its characters.  If one wants to get involved, one has to explore both the processes of the operations and the consequences of the actions.  This movie has very little exploration within the consequential realm.  The fast behavioral and event transitions make the world that this movie tries to create very bland.  Hence making each interaction feel forced.  This fact doesn't develop the movie enough for this structuring to work.\n\nWhen the rivalry between Eli and Daniel ended, I felt as if nothing was accomplished and that the point that this movie was trying to make was fundamentally flawed.  Kurosawa once said that even if one has wonderful production value for a movie, but a bad script, the result would always be a bad movie.  I know many people who like this movie and I have no problem with that.  This is one of those style-over-substance movies, but due to its material I'd have expected something much deeper.  \"There Will Be Blood\" is only the bare surface of what makes a great movie.  If anyone reading this got into it, that's fine.  But due to its many problems in the essential realms, it did nothing for me.",

He is quite simply fantastic as the fiery, vengeful and driven oilman and deserved his . Plainview becomes so dislikeable he is likeable, and I found myself routing for him, after all he is the film. The scenes between pastor Eli and Daniel, in particular the two where each humiliates the other, are worth the price of admission alone.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm biased, maybe Daniel Day-Lewis is one of my favourite actors, maybe because I work in the oil industry the film's subject appeals to me more, maybe great shots of drilling derricks and flaming oil gushers set against the American West just do it for me. Or maybe not, maybe Paul Thomas Anderson has just created a truly great film, full of memorable images and lines. Although central to the film, the themes of religion and capitalism are allowed to exist without heavy handed interference from Anderson. Ultimately, neither come out of the other side smelling of roses.\r\n\r\nThe reason this film only scores 9/10 is due to the score. Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood is responsible for the score which Tarantino complimented as \"one of the great modern original soundtracks of the last decade\" but it just didn't agree with me.",

Definitely not a film for everyone, especially those with short attention spans, this is a masterpiece and a true sign there is hope yet for Hollywood.",

            "content": "'My name is Daniel Plainview and this is my son DW'\n\nAn outstanding performance from Daniel Day Lewis in this historic backdrop of the discovery of Oil in the frontier of America. What i love about DD lewis is that although he takes long breaks from films, i admire he chose carefully, if you look at films like Gangs Of New York and his recent film Lincoln, there is a pattern emerging which to me it seems he is trying to archive a piece of history onto film, which is America's history.\nDaniel Plainview is a gold digger who stumbles across oil and realises the mass of oil in the west, An accident occurs in one of the wells and becomes a baby's adopted father. The film jumps a number of years to when Plainview finds a perfect piece of land where 'oil is seeping out of the ground'. The character development from Day Lewis is astonishing, Plainview is a man who is selfish,manipulative, jealous and violent, yet within the film he acknowledges his own traits. When his alter ego a religious man Eli is easily manipulated and violated by Plainview, the chemistry on screen is sometimes cringy to see as Eli is so binded to his religion at times i sympathise with Plainview.\nThe film is a roller coaster ride people around him change and so does america, but Plainview is so concrete in his ideas and beliefs that he looses them closest to him. An excellent directed film from Paul T Anderson and a homage to the independent who managed to achieve one of the greatest films of the 21st century, a must see film for historic and psychological life lessons.",

Daniel and Eli start with very little and do everything they can to gain more.\n\nAny discussion of the greater implications of the politics in this movie are going to be highly projected depending on who you are talking to. You could just as easily make a case that the movie is talking about atheism as an evil that ruins glorious capitalism as you could say that it is entirely anticapitalist.

I should have watched it immediately because it's such a good film i'm finding it difficult to find fault at all.\r\n\r\nBased on a called 'Oil!' it's a story of a mans ambition and need to progress by any means he deems fit. I found similarities in Flight with this - whilst it's not in the same manner or amount, 'Daniel' (Daniel Day Lewis) is self-destructive - through his ambition. All he cares about is his work and driving forward with his business he's someone not satisfied with what he has. Growth is everything. At first he seems a pleasant and thoughtful individual - meeting with clients and his son offering them something others cannot. But his true nature and intentions are shown slowly and come at full force when his son is deafened and sends him away. This is when we start to dislike him as a person and eventually hate him' 'P.T Anderson' masterfully toys with our feelings telling us when and how we feel about 'Daniel', he knows this and continues to crank it up as the film continues.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the film is better only because we know  'Daniel' and there's also some magnificent scenes particularly his drunk talk with his son at his house. 'Daniel Day Lewis' is quite frankly perfect as 'Daniel' not because of his name but he does such a convincing job and a well acted performance it's faultless. But 'Paul Dano' is also excellent - he's some way of Daniel Day Lewis but he's on fine form and probably should have won best supporting actor at the time.\r\n\r\n'There Will Be Blood' is a powerful and thoroughly engrossing and dark film that i'm tempted to say is a masterpiece. 'Daniel Day-Lewis' at his best and delivers one of the greatest performances in movie history and 'Paul Dano' in fine form too. Widely regarded as the best film of the last decade and it's hard to argue.",
