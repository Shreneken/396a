Now update, seemingly inspired by another reason, seems to only feed to the senses associated through the eyes rather than the ears while contradicting its intentions with those visual obligations, albeit being the proclaimed loose adaptation but it doesn't mean to forget the purpose. While the distantly memorable amusement towards the original remains constant as that faithful effect equips with jarring honesty obscured by depicted irrational normalcy in the contexts, it progresses ridiculously hence its self-contradiction. Whether or not this is actually a reflection is left for debate, it was gracefully approached in how to get across with the characters to build up its moments that worked nicely under diegetic perception of simultaneous conflict. Unlike before, Reeves, who's fond of the original, provided an unseen mental depth but didn't perform at Michael Rennie's level that helped before because that's a hypocritical hint evident when conversing with Cleese's character, who peaks performatively close to Rennie's level. The rest been demoted as stock, insignificant and stubbornly unreasonable, therefore deeming the execution subpar towards the speculatively more faithful script but the screenplay as a whole concluded neatly that's worth pondering. As per routine depends on capability, it's inferior but managed to get its points across. (B-)",

It means the world stood still when positive proof life exists on other planet, not that some alien we have no idea exist randomly pushes a button and everything stops dead.  Why?  Because that's stupid.  And what was wrong with the flying saucer that was in the first movie?  Since people have seen flying saucers?  It was during a time when aliens used impractical and stupid ways of space travel.  Still has the same problem as the original.  With the vastness in the universe I doubt we are the only violent species out there.  Plus you know when Keenu didn't want the part as he is awful in this.  Sure his British accent in \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" was bad but you can tell he was trying.  Movies like this he didn't give a fuck.  It's bad and he knew it.  Lastly Gort was ruined. Sure, he looks like the original but he was a lot more violent than the original, which leave the message of peace hypocritical.  Stick with the original, not just awful remake.",

There is no message of hope. Keanu's alien is a psychotic pissed off old Testament god who must be convinced not to destroy humanity for the sake of the \"environment\". How he's convinced is pure Hollywood American Cheese Food Product. This contemporary rewrite of a what originally was a parable about war and violence completely fails. Instead of a mentor with an invitation to join a larger whole, but only if we solve our problems, the alien is now the enemy. An enemy who is initially going to wipe out humanity but changes his mind at the last moment and decides to change humanity at the point of a gun. This movie sucks as much as it blows. There's so much more about it that's just absurd but I don't have the patience or time to enumerate them. Don't waste your time watching this stupid stupid movie.",

First of all, Keanu Reeves may be a good actor, but this is the wrong type of film for him. It tries to go into depth about his belief of 'kill a few, save many'. The same thing that happens in loads of movies, proving it's just another generic blockbuster made for nothing but that sweet sweet $$$. \nMASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD\nIF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS, SKIP UNTIL SPOILERS END\n\nThe story - well there is no story - is that an alien gets shot while trying to warn of a crisis on Earth. When they find his human appearance, and he comes back to life (somehow), he goes on the run with someone I already forgot the name of, I'll just call them Dr. Phil. Anyway, Dr. Phil then makes Klaatu (the alien) change his mind and so they try to save the day. They do, and all the electricity gets switched off from this. But it's not clear if Klaatu survived or died, I don't know. \nEND OF SPOILERS\n\nAnyway, I hate this movie. It tries to be a 'sci-fi film that is so serious it has to show off Keanu Reeves (The Matrix) being in it. Is it a worse remake than A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010)? No, but that's a different genre, and it's not saying much. Just skip this disaster, and yes, it is categorised as a disaster movie, please pardon the pun.",

And i must confess, i thought that too. Well he certainly proved that assumption wrong. And it seems like once he was financially comfortable, then he began picking projects that he was a genuine fan of.\n.\nSo when i first heard about this remake in the works then i was looking forward to it very much indeed. However, like a gazillion films before it (most notably in the sci-fi genre) i sense that nervous executives, not understanding the SF crowd, and placing far to much faith in some bad // old market research, have interfered and insisted that the cute, whining, pouty and petulant child be made a much bigger aspect of this film than he really should have been.\n.\nThe worst thing is, when this kind of thinking and interference ruins a film then it's not those that ruined it that take the fall. If there was any possible way that a fan edit could just take out a lot of the annoying child here (as has happened with some of the Star Wars franchise), then there could still have been a good film left.\n.\nUnfortunately, if my theory about executive interference is correct, then rather than just add a few unnecessary scenes that wouldn't be missed, here i think that they have rewritten whole chunks of the story (compared to the original film) so that if you just edited out all the annoying, petulant, foot stamping, then what's left wouldn't really make as much sense.

Derrickson spices up the old Robert Wise classic with exciting action and killer CGI for the alien powers. Derrickson's direction is the reason to watch with a penchant for the creepy atmosphere and ominous assaults of violence.\n\nIt's a neat sci-fi story with an endearing environmentalist message that David Scarpa's script leans more into why violence is bad and a lesser alternative to negotiation. All the American government and military try is attacking instead of mediating between the aliens and us, so they fail. Whereas the lead tries to communicate and understand another's perspective, which the alien responds to more. It's a neat extraterrestrial encounter movie that has a sleek look. It's not a perfect sci-fi classic, but I think Derrickson's dedicated direction balances the intense jolts of action with the sincere family drama well.\n\nKeanu Reeves is so fun as the alien ambassador Klaatu. His deadpan delivery is perfect as the disaffected alien experiencing being human for the first time. He takes it seriously and ends up feeling intimidating and looking cool as necessary. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as a brilliant scientist and concerned mother debating an alien on humanity's behalf. Her warmth and earnest portrayal of Helen Benson make Connelly a compelling lead actress for The Day the Earth Stood Still.\n\nKathy Bates is apt as the stern and unyielding Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson. Jaden Smith is very expressive and emotional as Jacob Benson. I get that he's an annoying child character, but Smith plays him convincingly. John Cleese's cameo is wonderful as the thoughtful Professor Barnhardt. Jon Hamm is solid as the supportive Michael Granier, but he should have had a bigger role. Kyle Chandler is excellent as the cold and officious John Driscoll. James Hong's cameo supporting role as Mr. Wu is sweet with a dramatic gravitas he does not always get to play.\n\nWayne Wahrman's editing is neat and quickly paced, making The Day the Earth Stood Still's 104 minute run-time fly by fast. David Tattersall's cinematography is very interesting with moody lighting, excellent use of fog in wide shots, and a vast variety of perspectives and angles to keep things visually fresh. Tyler Bates' music is ominous and exciting as needed adding a depth to Derrickson's intriguing direction.\n\nI find that Scott Derrickson's The Day the Earth Stood Still remains an interesting sci-fi movie, I don't get why people complain about this one all the time.",

            "content": "I know this movie is hated among critics but I won't be ashamed to say that I actually really like it. It's filled with clich\u00e9s we've seen too many times but I can't help but defend it and say that these clich\u00e9s have had life breathed into them with this new cast and modern retelling. I have yet to see the original 1951 'classic' but it's on my list. So without further ado here is, The Day the Earth Stood Still from 2008 starring Keanu Reeves as the alien Klaatu, Jennifer Connelly as Dr. Benson, and Jayden Smith as Jacob Benson.\n?\nThe story centers on blue orbs coming down from space and landing of course in New York City. Not any place in NYC but Central Park. Clearly the United States and the President of the United States even to the aliens is the center of 'civilization.' The orbs do settle in other places but not nearly important enough to get more than 2 seconds of screen time. Because of these mysterious orbs doctors of biology, chemistry and a civil engineer get called upon by the FBI to help investigate what's going on. Dr. Benson, a professor of astrobiology, is one of those chosen few. She however is also a step mother of Jacob. Jacob's father who was also her husband died so the two are not blood related but she cares for him nonetheless even though he doesn't return that affection. Dr. Benson goes to see the blue orb with the other doctors and what emerges is a gigantic killer robot and a small space alien with the human DNA of Keanu Reeves. He and his fellow robot friend are taken in for testing but Benson helps him escape knowing that the secretary of defense (played by Kathy Bates) will only want to destroy him and not listen to what he has to say. Benson, Jacob and Klaatu drive around and discover more about each other. Benson realizes that Klaatu's plan is to destroy all of the humans who are killing earth in order to keep earth a green planet. Benson tries to convince him otherwise but when she does it's too late and the plan already started. The giant robot turns into trillions of little metal eating bugs destroying anything man made or human in its path (we even get the typical I am Legend scene when the bugs kill the unsuspecting scientist and the evil government agent watches not letting him out, and then the evil government agent gets killed by said bugs). Benson and Jacob who have been fighting for the whole movie finally reconcile their differences because they realize that they have to put up with each other for the rest of their lives which makes Keanu or 'Klaatu' realize that humans are worth saving. He sacrifices himself to save earth.\n\nYes this movies has plot holes. One of them being why didn't the government call on Dr. Benson's doctor friend who Klaatu sees and befriends later in the movie? But for all its plot holes the cast really carries this movie. Keanu Reeves plays a great unfeeling alien because he himself is good at not showing much emotion. Jennifer Connelly plays a convincing doctor as well as a strong mother showing that women can do it all. The fact that the secretary of defense and the main lead are women without shoving it down your throat is extremely refreshing. These types of movies where women are just strong characters without the script hammering it in with lines 'for a girl' or 'girl power' are my favorites.\n\nIn addition to the mainly feminine cast it is also racially diverse. Keanu Reeves is Asian and maybe this does play into the fact that the Asian American stereotype is that we are unfeeling robots but either way he does talk in mandarin with James Hong (Mr. Ping from Kung Fu Panda) and it's amazing (because who doesn't love James Hong?!). Benson as a white step mother and Jacob as her African American son helps blended families as well as racially diverse families be seen. It would have been great to see flashbacks of the African American father to show a black man with a white woman but I think it works over all. Maybe it does add to the stereotype that blended families are dysfunctional but it also shows that sometimes maybe water can be thicker than blood.\n\nAll of the sci-fi alien clich\u00e9s aside the movie has no love story. There's no sexual tension with Klaatu or Benson or Benson falling in love with a fellow scientist, it's all platonic or familial which we almost never see in movies starring a male or female lead. In male centered movies it's even more of a requirement just to show that the man isn't queer. But the great thing about this movie is that it doesn't force a love story. It doesn't really force a lot of things since it heavily relies on old movie tropes like killing humans to make a better earth, trying to convince the alien humans are good, and self-sacrifice but those are all done well because of the cast.\n?\nI give The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008) an 8.5/10. It's clich\u00e9 but just edgy enough to keep me interested and entertained. The familiar plot doesn't distract but almost fades into the background to let the actors shine. Plus, some points like the aliens landing in New York City can be laughable and fun.",

His role would have been more interesting than the son. If the film focused more on our humanity rather than the action, then we would care more about the characters and why is it okay to be human. Plus, it would have be fun to see Klatuu interact with several characters in our world, which would have been a humorous, yet heartwarming journey.

It's a shame that the film is so narrative flawed, because director Scott Derrickson certainly has an eye for visual flair. Acting-wise, the film is hit-or-miss: Keanu Reeves gives a chilling, albeit stoic, performance as the mysterious otherworldly visitor, and Jennifer Connelly is great as always, but the supporting cast is either bland, or has their talent wasted. Jaden Smith in particular is pretty poor: it's easy to put his performance off due to him being a child actor, but he's simply not good enough to carry his material. It's definitely not a good sign when a desire to have a child character killed off is a recurring feeling.

            "content": "In 1928, a solitary mountaineer encounters a glowing sphere. He loses consciousness and when he wakes, the sphere has gone and there is a scar on his hand where a sample of his DNA has been taken. In the present day, a rapidly moving object is detected beyond Jupiter's orbit and forecast to impact Manhattan. The United States government hastily assembles a group of scientists, including Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly), to formulate a survival plan. The object is measured to be moving at 30,000 kilometers per second - enough to destroy nearly all life on Earth - but as it nears the planet, the object slows down just before impact and is revealed to be a large spherical spaceship, which lands gently in Central Park. The sphere is quickly surrounded by police and a heavily armed, hostile, and rather chaotic US military force. An alien emerges and Helen moves forward to greet it, but amidst the confusion, a soldier shoots the alien. A gigantic robot then appears that temporarily disables everything in the vicinity. The alien voices the command \"Klaatu barada nikto\" to shut down the robot's defensive response. A military surgeon discovers that the alien body is actually a bioengineered space suit, composed of placenta-like material covering a human-like being. The being quickly ages into Klaatu (Keanu Reeves), who looks like the mountaineer. Klaatu informs Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson (Kathy Bates) that he is a representative of a group of alien civilizations, sent to talk to the leaders of Earth at a United Nations conference in the city. Jackson instead orders that Klaatu be sent to a secure location for interrogation. Klaatu manages to escape and Helen and her stepson Jacob (Jaden Smith) give him a ride out of the area. The presence of the sphere, and others like it around the world, causes a widespread panic. The military launch a drone attack on the sphere, but are thwarted by the robot. They cautiously enclose the robot and transport it to Virginia. Klaatu meets with another alien, Mr. Wu (James Hong), who has lived on Earth for 70 years. Wu tells Klaatu that he has found the human race to be destructive and unwilling to change, which matches Klaatu's experience. Klaatu decides that the planet, with its rare ability to sustain complex life, must be cleansed of humans to ensure that it can survive. Klaatu orders smaller spheres to collect specimens of animal species, to preserve them off the planet. Helen quizzes Klaatu about his statement that he has come to save the Earth and discovers that he means to save the Earth from destruction by humankind. Meanwhile, the robot, named \"GORT\" by the military, is being examined in an underground facility. The robot transforms into a swarm of winged, insect-like, nano-machines that self-replicate as they consume everything in their path. The swarm starts to erase all trace of the human race...\n\n\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" from 2008 is a remake of the 1951 film of the same name. The majority of critics found the film \"heavy on special effects, but without a coherent story at its base. Bruce Paterson of the Australian Film Critics Association gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, writing that the generally poor reception for the film was \"a sad fate for a surprisingly sincere tribute to Robert Wise's 1951 classic.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars and noted that the film had \"taken its title so seriously that the plot stands still along with it\", but also stated that it was \"an expensive, good-looking film that is well-made by Scott Derrickson\". This remake suffers from underdeveloped themes, an incoherent plot, rough characterisation, wobbly acting and effects that takes over the storyline. The film starts off ok, but never really manages to convince due to lack of substance despite the fact that the story is intriguing with Klaatu wanting to save earth from mankind and not the opposite. In the end it just becomes a blockbuster action movie and not a full blown sci-fi movie with solid layers of a socio-political nature. Reeves is alien-like and wooden, no news here. While the talented and lovely co-star Jennifer Connelly isn't given much to work with, she still comes out of this with her dignity. And Jaden Smith is just a spoiled celebrity kid that adds nothing to the film. The idea was there, but the execution lacks a plenty.",

            "content": "In the current age of limited thought and writers strikes, it was inevitable production companies would eventually start trawling the archives hoping to rehash a classic and make it a hit once more. Sadly, The Day the Earth Stood Still remake with its distinct lack of tension and dull script fails to create that necessary sense of impending doom required for a successful disaster movies and buckles under its blockbuster expectations.\n\nWooden acting phenomenon Keanu Reeves with his naturally vacant expressions and uncomfortable screen presence seemingly fits a re-born alien role perfectly. However, his frozen faced and surprisingly flat performance is tiring to watch and is merely more than instantly forgettable.\n\nExploiting the ever-so-safe preapproved formula of modern end-of-the-world movies, A large unidentified spherical object is hurtling itself at warp speed towards earth (gasp) and as if you were surprised the US government takes it upon themselves to be our saviour. \n\nLeaving tact and decorum at the door and forcefully collecting any citizen that may be of help, leading astrobiologist Helen Benson (Jennifer Connolly) is taken without explanation  to a secret location(what a surprise), without the company of her sarcastic maladjusted stepson Jason (Jaden Smith) to save the world from inhalation (hopefully before the 78 minute collision deadline). \n\nWhen officials get caught off guard and the object stops short of impact in central park, Helen and fellow scientists are rushed to the scene. Flanked by a full and aggressive military arsenal, an unearthly shape suddenly appears in the fog (on a perfectly clear New York night) and advances. A trigger-happy soldier takes a shot injuring the whale-blubber Michelin man shape unknowingly awaking an in-build security system. (Predictably enough) A giant Cyclops robot appears to protect its charge by disabling all electronic equipment within the vicinity.\n\nThe injured form is rushed back to the secure military facility for medical attention under Helen's instruction, after extracting the bullet the protective outer \"placenta -like\" cocoon falls away revealing a human shaped alien named Klaatu. \n\nWhile being questioned by a presidential representative Regina Jackson (Kathy Bates), Klaatu reveals his intentions \"I am here to save earth\". This ominous opening statement and his vague attempts of communication leads the government to believe that Klaatu is an enemy, and Helen is ordered to assist in sedating the alien. (As expected) By this stage of course, Helen has developed a feeling of connection to the being is compelled to help protect him by defying orders.\n\nKlaatu, in his 'no-so-sedated' state is lead away for interrogation via lie detector (yeah an alien who can control electrics is going to be susceptible to lie detector, logical) using his abilities to manipulate the situation he escapes. Once free, Klaatu realises that his injured body requires attention and reaches for assistance from Helen along with her defiant son to succeed in the purpose of his visit. \n\nWith sphere's materialising around the globe subtlety carrying out their Noahs arc duties of preserving a sample of each of earths living creatures, the obligatory race against time to save mankind ensues. But will Helen's attempt to emotional reach Klaatu and prove our ability to adapt and learn from our mistakes gain his protection before the cleansing process removes all trace of our existence.\n\nThe suspense that follows is little more than uninteresting subtly hidden behind a barrage of special effects. Stephen Derrickson's hands-off-approach to directing leaves Jennifer Connelly's attempt to inject passion into a single heart-plucking scene falls short of touching.\n\nVerdict: The predictably formulaic style and mediocre delivery lacks intensity and stamina. Where the original film is unassuming, this version is intolerably full of its self and presents as a bloated X-files episode engorged to pseudo-cosmic proportions.  If you're after a tuned out Saturday evening fluff movie this fits the out-of-worldly bill.\n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 16/01/2009",

Now would be the good time to change since Earth itself is primed for destruction under Klaatu's orders. It's up to Klaatu to change his mind in order to stop what is to befall Earth by giving the human race one more shot at changing their violent ways. I maybe a cynic, but this movie's message didn't work for me. Saving the human race so that it can TRY for the millionth time to change their ways or else be destroyed is outright nonsense. I mean blow the Earth up already. Humans are incapable of change which is why this movie's simple message is downright overrated and unrealistic. \n\nAside from it's story, I did like a few things here.

Reeves is too stiff, lacking the likability of Rennie, Connolly is dull, and Jaden Smith is not that great an actor. Watch the original, look for better modern sci-fi (hell you can watch Reeves in better more original sci-fi in the \"Matrix\" films), and skip this tedious bore.",

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN JUNO SEAL*\n\nListen, as a fan of the original 1951 classic, I can honestly say that this film is just a mockery of it.  The original Day the Earth Stood Still was an ultra campy B-movie, with terrible effects, wooden acting, and incomprehensible plot.  So why am I a fan?  Well, it's one of the funniest films to ever grace the screen.  Watching a man sized alien terrorize New York and people screaming periodically and idiotically is hilarious.  Not to mention it's a very good film to roast.  So when I heard they were remaking the film with Keanu Reeves and Jaden Smith, I got discouraged.  One was a proven failure and the other had been in only one film (though now, he's a proven failure as well).  The Day the Earth Stood Still remake takes out all the charm and fun that the original had and basically Nolanized it before that term existed.\n\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still remake is about Helen Benson played by Jennifer Connelly.  She is a space-o-ologist (or whatever they're called) who lives with her \"son\" (played by Jaden Smith).  The two obviously have issues and Jaden (though black) turns white-boy on her, calling her a mistake.  So, she's not having good things going on home.  What better way to make up for that than with an alien invasion....sorta.  A huge sphere lands in the middle of New York.  Klaatu, played by Keanu.  He comes in and gets shot like a bitch.  Then, he recovers!  Yay!  So, Connelly's character is forced to study him and his giant friend GORT.  Soon, she realizes that Klaatu is a representative of other alien races, who want to speak with the UN.  They refuse and some mumbo jumbo goes on, and Klaatu decides to exterminate humanity.\n\nLet's start off.  The acting is atrocious.  Keanu basically plays Keanu, but at least, it sorta worked for the character.  However, it's still a bland and one-note performance.  You know, for someone who's related to an actor with huge amounts of charm and likability, Jaden Smith is a bland actor.  Will Smith is a very great comedian, so why didn't any of his charm rub off on his son?  Guess it's cause of that Pinkett woman.  Jennifer Connelly is a terrible, terrible actress and it shows in this film.  She and Jaden have no chemistry and she can't have any with Keanu cause......he's Keanu.  It's just such a terribly acted film with a terrible script to go along.  Don't get me started on the script.  You don't want to know how much it pisses me off.\n\nAnother thing that pissed me off was the plot.  Now look, the original was no Oscar winner, but it wasn't taking itself as seriously as this film.  One of the most pretentious attempts at such a terrible plot.  Everything in this film is all dark or moody.  The film has a sense that it is of higher importance than the original when it's not.  The original is a classic in the B-movie genre while this is the anus of the multiverse.  And don't get me started on the bees....BEES!?  Really?  Maybe if Nicolas Cage was in this film shooting lasers out his eyes, killing the bees and protecting humanity, this film would be awesome. (SERIOUSLY MAKE THAT MOVIE NOW!) But no, Nicolas Cage isn't in this.  GORT turns into little wasps that can apparently devour an 18 wheeler whole.  It's stupid and silly, but the film isn't lighthearted.  It takes itself too seriously, resulting in a film of Man of Steal Yo Money sized proportions.  Seriously, there are striking similarities (The cinematography is too similar).  \n\nOverall, The Day the Earth Stood Still remake is terrible.  It takes everything great about the original 1951 version and tosses it away for CG overabundance.  Pews to the left and Pews to the right.  It's terribly acted as well.  I don't even need to mention Keanu, do I?  Will Smith has lost his mind if he thinks his son is nearly as good as him, seeing as Will was the only reason I didn't put a bullet in my head after watching I Am Legend (2/10).  Connelly is bland and useless.  The film is just terrible on all accounts.  It's definitely inferior to the remake and feels like a washed up B-movie.  Thank you, Scott Derrickson for now making two terrible films (This and The Exorcism of Emily Rose) and one okay film (Sinister).  Now, if you mind, leave the art of filmmaking for good.",

Darker in tone and visual style than the original, this story tells of an alien, Klaatu (Keanu Reeves), who takes a human form and comes to Earth to render punishment for our poor treatment of the other lifeforms that share the planet with us (in the original, mankind's nuclear weapons were a threat to other galactic civilizations). Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly), a recent widow who is having a hard time coping with her late husband's son Jacob (Jaden Smith), tires to convince Klaatu to give humans one more chance to change their ways. Several plot points depend on the actions of Jacob, who has a remarkably inconsistent attitude towards Klaatu, sometimes wanting to kill him and sometimes asking for his help. Federal agents swoop in more than once to scoop up Helen because she's needed for consultations with the government. The tool Klaatu unleashes to eliminate humanity sometimes operates with blinding swiftness and other times with far less effectiveness and speed, so that characters have time to react and debate. The core idea is still interesting, but the revision that takes place here saps most of the tension and moral message from the film.",

Overall it doesn't insult the integrity of the source material.  It does fall prey to the typical popcorn tradition of blowing stuff up real good and having some famous places get demolished.  I suppose it is obligatory.... and it does look real good.\n\nOn the other hand though the script doesn't take the source material to new heights either.  They changed the moral focus from nuclear war to the environment, but the moral agenda is all righteous postering and preaching all at face value.  They don't really do much digging to get a deeper understanding of both parties human and alien.  The environment issue is not black & white, but the script treats it as such.  The movie basically has a strong opinion, but with no brains behind it.\n\nBottom line is that we have a technically well made film with fine performances that gave the film the heart that its script could not provide on its own.

The story is about an alien traveler named Klaatu played by Keanu Reeves (who is in human form when he's an alien) heads to Earth with his bodyguard robot named Gort. Ok from here what pisses me off about this classic and not just the remake only is that why can't Klaatu wear the robot suit and he could be the one Earth's population looks up to instead of Klaatu looking like a wanderer and having some random bodyguard taking over his job; You know what, chuck this Gort character out because he's not needed. He's irrelevant, unnecessary and a waste of time. Anyway, they came to Earth to warn the humans about them destroying their own planet. But since no one listens, they leave at the end of the movie causing the Earth to stop at the very end of the movie. What a low blow! The story's all over the place, it doesn't make sense. The actors are wasted because their characters are boring even Keanu Reeves as Klaatu which is annoyingly bad. to make the perfect remake of this original source material, all we need is Klaatu in a robot suit and he makes the Earth stop causing the world population to look up to him and make the world a better place. That would be a kick-ass The Day The Earth Stood Still remake. But no. The Day The Earth Stood Still (2008) gets a 4/10.",

Keanu Reeves' famous expressionlessness lends Klaatu a sinister quality, and I was thrilled that the makers chose to keep the iconic image of Gort.  But they clearly had no idea how to end the film, so the second half descends into Mummy-style silliness before Klaatu has a change of heart and saves us all for no apparent reason.  Yet another example of the assumption that SFX triumph over plot.  They really don't.  Watch the 1951 version instead.",

Just a small-minded little green earth type \"smart person\" flick... for Canadians and simple gardening folk... who don't own any video games, and enjoy the simple things. In that sense, it's a masterpiece. For a story, it's one of the best. The love for this is universal and is certainly better than the two Matrix sequels. And those two sequels were masterpieces. It's a really huge, different & explosive movie that really is a little corny and isn't really the challenge I was hoping. Just leave out the negative attitude and this would have been one of the best movies I've ever seen, instead it's just decent. It's just so haunting and mesmerizing and worthy of multiple viewings that I kind of loved it, even though irresistibility is not a trait I seek in movies in the modern era. So it's not perfect, nor is it a masterpiece or even a challenge, just hauntingly good eye-popping fun & wonder. This was a wonderful masterpiece of brilliant storytelling and shocking, scary, eye-popping thought provoking fun.  It had sadness, happiness, unbelievable colors and effects plus some 11 very memorable characters, I mean, yes it's kind of like a video game but it's still better art than a lot of stupid silly games and this really worked for me as a stunning, serviceable and shocking happy movie with some brilliant performances and even better storytelling. The only wrong with this was that it wasn't goofy enough.  It will benefit your dvd collection and be a great one that you will watch over and over again because it's perfect for anyones dvd collection, it will be a masterpiece in your movie madness collection - up there with the Mummy, the Incredibles, King Kong, the Matrix, the Abyss, Terminator 3, Mission to Mars and Jurassic Park 2.  Just incredible! Chills thrills spills and general nuttiness, warped colors, beautiful epiphanies and a solemn, somber tone that really worked for me-it wasn't perfect or a special movie but it was a lot of great storytelling and great gorgeous and creative coy humorless maniacal fun.",

Needless to say, he is the only highlight of the film, even with a very limited dialogue and nut much action. The film just seemed \"blah\" to me, boring, uneventful, lame, and very poor special effects. The storyline is great, original, and I like alien films, but there just wasn't enough to keep this movie good.
