Deliberate, intimate, wrenching, and quietly chilling, this Romanian film gets under your skin and stays with you long after it's over. Set during Romania's era under Communist rule, it shows the harrowing conditions of obtaining an abortion amidst the paranoia of life in a police state. Director Cristian Mungiu brilliantly allows the events of one day to unfold in long, unbroken takes, giving the film a real-time texture that slowly builds tension throughout. The actors are all magnificent, the writing is naturalistic, and a genuine sense of fear from the political subtext engrosses you in the story. Great, and flawless",

The movie is about abortion in 1987 in Romania, with drama and thriller element. Everything happened in 1 day. Many long takes, a bit boring to watch at the beginning. Though communism is not mentioned, but the overall societal environment serves as the backdrop of the story. The film is neither for or against abortion.",

Despite being unrelentingly grim, the movie is gripping from the first scene to the last as the  handheld camera follows the characters activities through seedy streets and dingy hotels with lengthy and well-choreographed shots that make the viewer feel like they are in the midst of the action. Four Months, Three Weeks and Two Days is as impactful and memorable as a film can be.",

            "content": "This Romanian masterpiece is above all discreet and incredibly purposeful. It is discreet because when addressing the issue of abortion, it does not stand in judgement nor does it resort to sentimentality. The characters of the film are terrifyingly convincing, while the cast's acting is exceptional: one can feel the intensity and pain each and every minute of the film. The silence in the film is unbelievably heavy, the suspense is abundant. Above all, discretion is reflected in the film's portrayal of Ceausescu's regime. It does not depict the socialist dictatorship and its abysmal cruelty through rambling cinematic proclamations or theatricism, but through its own grayish reality: it is a regime that builds monstrosities for people to live in, that tries to control its people's lives - by telling them where to work, where to live and, tragically, that they cannot control their own bodies. And the people under this regime are also grayish: the tacit patriarchy casts its shadow and is evident everywhere. The two protagonists seem to experience hell; a hell of fear, exploitation and oppression. And they experience it silently, without vocal objection - perhaps because they know they cannot do otherwise. All in all, this film, with its exquisite cinematography and direction, is a real manifesto for the right of women to abortion, and therefore the right of people to have control over their bodies, as well as a manifesto for the cruelty and brutality of totalitarian regimes.",

            "content": "Winner of the Palme D'Or at Cannes in 2007, this Romanian film is a harrowing glimpse into life for young people in the repressive Ceau?escu era. Specifically, we see two young university students trying to arrange an illegal abortion in 1987.  However, nothing is particularly clear from the start and director Cristian Mungiu only gradually reveals details of the women's situation -- and the brutal social and political context is explored only indirectly in passing.  But perhaps because we are absorbed by the immediacy of the action (presented in widescreen long shot or as recorded by a mobile hand held camera), the harshness of life (and the corresponding indomitability or frailty of the human spirit) in Romania at that time comes across more clearly than it might in a more didactic film.  In other words, you can intellectually contemplate the political or statistical data that tell us about what happened in Romania (or Syria or Rwanda or Cambodia or Nazi Germany) but an in-your-face narrative from the victim's point of view is always going to pack a stronger punch.  This is not to say that the film is not enjoyable - in many ways it is enthralling (a testament to the direction and the stellar acting of Anamaria Marinca) as we experience a narrow slice of Romania firsthand in a way that those of us privileged to have been born free wouldn't have.  Theirs is a drab, dark, wintry, impersonal, and seemingly dangerous world.  But the specific incidents that happen to these women - and the fact that evil is perpetrated against them by men in particular - can't fail to highlight feminist and social justice concerns that are universal.",

I'm on the minority here when I say that I didn't enjoy this film because the film has won several important awards and has been considered a masterpiece by most critics. As much as I wanted to enjoy this film, I have to be honest and say I felt it was a dull and boring movie. I tend to enjoy these character driven dramas, but I really never felt connected with the characters here and never felt the suspense that most people felt when they watched this. There were a few enjoyable moments and some strong performances, but the plot was simple and I never was drawn into the story. Despite the great camera work and the excellent craft, I never was attracted to this film or cared for the resolution. I'm sure it depicts perfectly the era when Romania was under Ceausescu's communist regime, but having seen so many foreign films focusing on social issues I didn't think there was anything special that stood out here, but I'm probably wrong because everyone else seemed to have loved this film.\n\nThe film takes place during the final years of Ceausescu's communist regime in Rumania and it centers on a college student named Otilia (Anamaria Marinca) as she begins to make plans in order to help her roommate, Gabita (Laura Vasliu), have an abortion. We don't really find out about the abortion until 30 minutes into the film, but the trailers take away the suspense. The communist regime doesn't allow birth control nor abortion, so they have to do things quietly and secretly. Otilia arranges to book a reservation at a hotel and picks up a doctor who has offered his service, although it won't be free and it will cost them a little more than money. His name is Bebe (Vlad Ivanov) and he takes advantage of Gabita's desperation to have the abortion and her friend's willingness to help. Everything has to be done quietly in the hotel room because if they are caught they can end up in jail, but Otilia also has to deal with her boyfriend Adi (Alex Potocean) as she has promised to visit him for his mom's birthday.  There are a lot of things at stake here, but Otilia is determined to help out her friend.\n\nOne of the main issues I had with the film was that I never believed the friendship between Otilia and Gabita was strong enough for her to go through such extreme measures in order to help her. They seemed pretty distant and I never understood why she was willing to help. I have my theories, but the film is purposefully ambiguous. It is slow paced and nothing really happens. I don't have an issue with this because in films like A Separation it still worked for me because I connected with the characters. Mungiu portrays the era really well and never takes sides on the pro abortion or pro life issue, rather focusing on the dangers of the oppressive regime. It is a very realistic and dark film and Marinca gives a strong performance as the lead character. The best part of the film however was the scene where Ivanov's character manipulates the girls in the hotel room. He was great in that scene. I'm disappointed that I never got to appreciate the film as much as everyone else did, but there is no denying that  Mungiu directed a memorable film.",

The silence of snow falling outside a window, newborn kittens crying, a receptionist coughing, clothes wrinkling as people move about a small room, the cold knock of medical tools rubbing against each other in a leather bag. And all that heightens the fairly simple one-two of the actual performance of an abortion. Because Cristian Mungiu's \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\" is one of those ingenious fill-in-the-blanks cases of show-don't-tell, and it'll leave you either incredibly frustrated or profoundly touched by its handling of the complicated emotions of indifference. Nearing the end of communist Romania, Gabita (a gentle, innocent-to-the-point-of-being-helpless, and all the more amazing for it Laura Vasiliu) seeks with the help of her roommate Otilia (an equally striking Anamaria Marinca) a back-alley abortion after the title amount of time to think over a decision. No more tears.\n\nIt seems to affect Otilia more, the haggling of finding a person willing to risk jail time for what's considered to be murder (even to the point of doling out sexual favors), the aftermath of cleaning up the mess, physically, spiritually, and emotionally. Mungiu is generous in his long and tracking shots, so not only do we feel like we're THERE, we feel the length, the distorted sense of reality, even -- in a dinner scene involving the friends of Otilia's boyfriend's (Alexandru Potocean) parents -- the anger that the scene doesn't cut off, that someone doesn't stand up and scream or cry, even walk away, because it's only ourselves we're fooling. Yeah. Speechless is right. \"4 Months\" is a tough movie to watch, even more so to stop thinking about, and that's exactly the point; it isn't made fine. It draws blood if you get too close, but that's the only way to even begin to comprehend its marvelously transfixing spell.",

As a fan of films that base the majority of the story through the use of long takes that Tarkovsky would have admired, thanks to the clever and intelligent method of this certain direction, Cristian Mungiu designs a realistic feeling to the film that looks as though we are watching something take place for real. The film is often uncomfortable and ferociously intense while the dialogue splashes across the scene in such an uncompromising and chilling method that an Oscar nomination certainly wouldn't have been a miss. A great film that might be better to watch alone, this is an example of world cinema at its most intense and believable.",
