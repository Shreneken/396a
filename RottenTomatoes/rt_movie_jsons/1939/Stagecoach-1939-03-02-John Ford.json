    "summary": "John Ford's landmark Western revolves around an assorted group of colorful passengers aboard the Overland stagecoach bound for Lordsburg, New Mexico, in the 1880s. An alcoholic philosophizer (Thomas Mitchell), a lady of ill repute (Claire Trevor) and a timid liquor salesman (Donald Meek) are among the motley crew of travelers who must contend with an escaped outlaw, the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), and the ever-present threat of an Apache attack as they make their way across the Wild West.",

            "content": "I think this movie is excellent (hence the four stars) but I did find that there were a number of characterizations and relationships that didn't get enough space to breathe. Wayne just immediately falls for Trevor. Carradine has some connection to the cavalryman's wife but it never gets explored. In one sense that's just a way of saying the world is bigger than what we get in the film, but those relationships seemed to be meaningful for the characters themselves, speaking directly to their motivations, we just don't really get to know what those motivations are. \n\nIn that way, this movie is almost like a snapshot of the lives of its characters, kind of like if Crash didn't suck. \n\nWayne is great in this. Almost boyish.",

There's humor, action, pathos, and a good story. What more can you ask for?",

While it is a very simply plot the movie layers it extremely well with 9 simple likeable characters who all give excellent performances. Dallas, Doc & Ringo are the standouts. The musical score is excellent, breathtaking cinematography and fantastic pacing keeping the adventure brisk. The action pieces are phenomenal and are some of the best action sequences I have ever seen not feeling dated at all. This movie while not having complex characters or a deep message makes up for it with loving craft, charming performances, and an amazing white knuckle action battle.

            "content": "\"Stagecoach\" is a brilliantly masterful film, it evokes the awe-inspiring feeling that one has witnessed the birth of a genre which has somehow sprung fully formed from the womb. Yes, the history of the Western precedes the making of \"Stagecoach,\" yet the film nonetheless strikes the viewer as incredibly complete, given the relatively rudimentary nature of sound-era Westerns at the time. It's technical mastery, observable in stunts which are just as breathtaking and impressive today, is matched only by its conscientious commitment to story development. Its characters, as many as there are, are invested with the kind of flawed humanity that transcends simple story construction. A perfect balance is thus achieved between straightforward thrills and equally engaging character dynamics, imbuing \"Stagecoach\" with the kind of towering greatness only observed in the best of all films.",

            "content": "John Wayne is \"The Ringo Kid\" in this John Ford-directed parable of outcasts traveling towards various kinds of figurative and literal redemption/salvation. On a surface level, the basic plot is disarmingly simple--a motley crew of eight takes a stagecoach from Tonto to Lordsburg, trying to avoid Geronimo and his Apaches on the way. They are having their own problems with the U.S. government and are thus likely to attack. The stagecoach bounces from outpost to outpost while the relationships of its passengers evolve, helping each other to \"find themselves\" and (usually) providing hope of some kind of new life.\n\nThe Ringo Kid has been wrongly accused of a crime and is on his way to Lordsburg to avenge both the false accusations and more importantly, the murder of his father and brother. Dallas (Claire Trevor) is implied to be a prostitute, and so is ostracized from Tonto (which means \"stupid\", \"foolish\" or \"daft\" in Spanish) by a self-stylized matronly moral majority. Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell) is far more concerned with getting drunk than being a doctor, and is partially ostracizing himself from Tonto. Hatfield (John Carradine) is a \"gambler gentleman\" with a shady reputation and a false identity. Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt) is trying to get to her husband, who is in the military; she's in a surprisingly \"secret\" physical state. Samuel Peacock, whom everyone keeps mistaking for a reverend, is in the alcohol business and just wants to get back east to get back to his business. Henry Gatewood is a crooked banker trying to flee before his questionable dealings are discovered. And the stagecoach drivers consist of a lovable buffoon, Buck (Andy Devine) and the most forthright, straight arrow of the bunch, Marshal Curly Wilcox (George Bancroft).\n\nEven though Stagecoach remains tightly focused on its wilderness road trip, that might seem like a large stable of characters to shape into a taut plot. Ford, working from script by Dudley Nichols and Ben Hecht, based on a short story, \"Stage to Lordsburg\", by Ernest Haycox (which itself bears a relation to Guy de Maupassant's \"Boule de Suif\", 1880), keeps the proceedings in check by only giving us the information we need to explore the evolving relationships, and only focusing on each character when they're important to the plot. This results in a few of the characters being functionally absent for extended lengths of time, but Ford can so easily establish a \"deep\" character with a minimum of screen time that the absences are not a detriment.\n\nThe principal focus, of course, is between Ringo and Dallas, as on a significant level, Stagecoach becomes a romance. They're initially brought together via their mutual ostracization, even among the ostracized, which gives them an immediate bond beyond their physical attraction towards one another. Wayne and Trevor are both fantastic in their roles, avoiding the occasional overacting by some other performers. But this is a film where it's difficult to count the slight overacting as a flaw, as it was more of a stylistic tendency of the genre during this period and it provides a nice counterbalance to Wayne and Trevor.\n\nStagecoach is also famous for its setting. Much of the film was shot in Utah's Monument Valley, along authentic stagecoach \"roads\". The (beautiful) starkness of the desert is often taken as a symbolic trip through a kind of purgatory for the characters, where they're left alone with their souls, their only connection being their small group, to contemplate their pasts and futures. Whether we choose to read something along those lines into the film or not, Monument Valley is at least a captivating presence in the film, although for me, the cinematography could have been better technically, especially considering that Stagecoach was made at the same time as The Wizard of Oz (1939). Ford's famous tendency to do only one take results in a couple minor gaffes, such as the initial shot of John Wayne--a zoom into a close-up--that is out of focus for most of the zoom.\n\nAs one could guess, eventually our passengers run into a band of Apaches, who are often interpreted as representing more of a \"natural force\" that our heroes must surmount. The climax features a fabulous extended chase/fight sequence with a number of amazing stunts by both humans and animals. The most impressive human stunts are performed by the legendary Yakima Canutt, including one that involved being dragged through the dirt by the horse-pulled stagecoach, which was moving along at about 40 miles per hour and supposedly missed running over Canutt by only 12 inches (30.5 cm). This scene was an inspiration for a similar stunt in Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).\n\nAlthough it's not a \"perfect\" film to me, and it's not even my favorite western (I'm more partial to the classic spaghetti westerns, for example), Stagecoach is a very good film and was very influential, despite being made at a time when Ford was told that he was committing professional suicide by even contemplating a western. As the plethora of critical literature attests, it works on many levels, including as an allegorical microcosm of U.S. Depression-era society, and should be seen at least once by anyone serious about film literacy.",

            "content": "A clear eyed Western with John Ford's auteur vision!\n\nJohn Ford's genre defining Western picture Stagecoach (1939) is so refined, that I'm honestly astonished by how concise and engaging it remains. Writers Ben Hecht, Dudley Nichols, and Ernest Haycox provide a sterling script with 9 memorable leads, ample action sequences, and finely tuned character development. The wicked are punished, the just rewarded, and the innocent are saved with a brutally realistic approach to storytelling. John Ford's direction is the real star as his focused vision of the American West demonstrates how wild and deadly these times were and how random civilians had to band together during desperate times to stay safe.\n\nBert Glennon's cinematography has creative framing with John Wayne gazing at a woman he loves straight down a dark hall or a stunning quick zoom in to introduce Wayne's character The Ringo Kid. John Wayne himself is charismatic, likable, kind, and skilled as a gunslinger in one of his most remarkable screen performances. I never cared for John Wayne for his normally stilted acting and conservative politics; however, Wayne captivates you in Stagecoach as only a deft Western actor could. John Wayne was in rare form here and certainly elevated by director John Ford's astounding mastery of expressive filmmaking.\n\nClaire Trevor plays the assumed prostitute Dallas with a charming warmth and sincere worry over how others cruelly ignore or chastise her. She has wonderful natural chemistry with The Duke himself. Andy Devine is hilarious as the eternally screaming and always dumb Buck. A young John Carradine gets a fantastic supporting role as the mysterious Southern gentleman and secretive gambler Hatfield. His paternal chemistry alongside the ethereal beauty of Louise Platt's lady Lucy Mallory is a real highlight of Stagecoach for me. You really start to like them after you get to know their characters.\n\nThomas Mitchell is excellent and entertaining as the ever drunken Doctor Josiah Boone. George Bancroft is gripping as Marshall Curly Wilcox with his strict sense of justice and dedication to the job. Donald Meek is pretty funny as the mild mannered alcohol man Samuel Peacock. Berton Churchill is really annoying as the self righteous banker Ellswood H. Gatewood. Elvira Rios, the Mexican singer and actress, cameos to sing a lovely old folk song on a captivating night as our heroes must wait out until morning.\n\nNotably, composers Gerard Carbonara, John Leipold, Leo Shuken, as well as Louis Gruenberg reinvigorated old folk songs with a modern flair. Their epic reworkings of Americana turn pieces of music into folk classics. Walter Plunkett's costumes look dazzling with intricately woven dresses for both lead actresses that define their social status as a real lady or a lady of the night. Norbert A. Myles' make-up does up Louise Platt into a delicate and refined lady, while giving Claire Trevor a beautiful natural look. Otho Lovering and Dorothy Spencer edit Stagecoach into a no frills Western, clocking in at a precise 96 minutes.\n\nIn short, Stagecoach is a Western worth seeking out for an old classic that dares to make you care about people from all walks of life.",

Sure, John Ford is a legend, and all his mastery as an auteur is on display here, bringing to life a metaphoric journey of castaways toward redemption like no other director can. However, with a less than dazzling restoration/preservation, the breakthrough cinematography is marred with the snap, crackle, and pop of an aging film reel, and jumpy edits that leave you wondering if this is how this film was intended to be seen. The sound is so challenging at times, I found myself not only rewinding scenes, but using the films Wikipedia page to understand key plot points. One jarring example is the important reveal of Dallas's true identity to Ringo, provided with limited dialogue, presented through the image of what we're supposed to understand is a brothel. We know from later Ford films how effective this can be, but here, it's challenging to comprehend given the poor quality of the visuals. The cast is hit or miss \u2014 with John Wayne as his capable cowboy at the helm. The female performances from the leads are way too packed with ingenue to be effective in a 21st century watch, and Andy Devines comic relief character \"Buck\" is downright annoying. The films racist depiction of Native Americans and Latinos is typical for the era..which is to say blatant and disgusting, so be warned. Thomas Mitchell's Academy Award winning performance is beyond deserving, serving as the casts deepest character, and lighting up the screen with every line. All in all, it's a film that's important to watch for its place in cinema history,  establishing Wayne, Ford, and the Western, as a American cinema mainstays, but 80 years has added some blemishes to the classic, making it not as digestible as it once was.",

In large part, this was due to it's beautiful cinematography of the scenery which John Ford and others would eventually use in future western films. This, along with the implementation of interesting characters essentially being put together in a box created what most people would say is a masterpiece for John Ford.\n\nBeing a product of it's time, it's no wonder that some well choreographed action scenes coupled with some interesting characters gained such a high revere in the western film world. Though it's safe to say that pretty much all westerns have this film to thank for the tropes that were almost over used in their films. \n\nThis film follows a stoic hero as he meets some unlikely travel companions on his journey to right the wrongs of his past. The hero also meets a woman on this journey who conveniently falls in love with the hero. Just this description alone seems like the clich\u00e9 of clich\u00e9s, yet, this film is regarded as a masterpiece because of its intricate implementation of characters with different motivations and personalities. \n\nOne of my main critiques of this film though, is not with the character development, but the use of a love interest to move the story forward. The fact that two characters who just met, in this case Ringo Kid and Lucy Mallory, are already enthralled with each other after a very short period is something that lacks motivation and makes me wonder why it couldn't have been implemented more realistically into the story.\n\nFor it's time, Stagecoach is a masterpiece as far as cinematography and the implementation of western style action scenes. Some of the characters were interesting and made me want to watch more, while others left me unconcerned for their well-being in the story. What should stand out the most about this film though, is it's use attempts to try something that hadn't been done on the same scale, which was to create one of the first classic westerns that millions have grown to love.",

            "content": "Stagecoach (1939)\nDirector John Ford\nStagecoach is a phenomenal movie that still stands on its own 80 years later. Stagecoach is a tried and true western. It has the damsel needing help by the hero cowboy who rides in to save the sheriff and the townsfolk from their enemies. It just goes about that story in a unique and interesting way. \nStagecoach has a damsel in distress, Dallas played by Claire Trevor. But instead of her being in danger of bad guys in danger of being an outcast in the world with no one to turn to. She is saved by the Hero, Ringo played by John Wayne, but the Hero is a cowboy on the run from the law, who interestingly enough saves the sheriff out to get him from a gang of natives. This new style of story makes the film more interesting and grabs the audience's attention better. Now we are not sure how the story will be told since we've never seen something like this before. The slight difference in the western narrative that Stagecoach goes for, also makes it all the more relatable. Now we have characters with flaws, characters that we the audience can relate to. Characters like Ringo, who is an honorable cowboy but on the run from the law, shows us that we are still good people even if we were dealt the short end of the stick. Or how Dallas is a girl working in a brothel, But we still empathize for her being shunned by communities and being an outcast because we know that people deserve being treated as equals no matter their situations. We see how these characters can relate very well back during the days of the depression. But even today these characters can still makes us relate to their struggles and actions. Stagecoach has the understanding that good people being dealt in hard circumstances still deserves to be loved and cared for. It's this theme that makes the film so relatable because it something we all go through. We all want to be loved and accepted even with all our own flaws. \nStagecoach shows us how we feel and what we want. Then it shows us how we can achieve what we want. Stagecoach shows us these characters that we relate to and then unites them. The characters through the ride of the stagecoach don't seem to get along very well. There is fighting and insults thrown at one another and divide happening between the upper class and the lower class passengers. But what in the end they all unite to fight the greater evil. Now the one bad part of the film is the racist portrayal of natives and Mexicans, but we're going to power through that since the film was made in a time where those things were a little more acceptable. The bad guys being savage natives. The unifying of the group shows the context of this film and tells the story of its time. Since Stagecoach took place in 1939 it happened right before WWII. The unifying tale of these everyday men show us how they must unite to take on a greater evil even if they all don't get along. It's for survival. The greater evil in Stagecoach was natives, in real life it is Nazi's. We can see how a theme of unifying together to take on a greater evil still relates in today's age as well. Whether it's our current politics or even just a sports game the theme is powerful and will also last throughout time.\nNow with the themes stated the way Stagecoach showcases these themes is incredible. The use of Music, setting and cinematography all go hand in hand to tell us this. Whether it's the main theme of Stagecoach and how it creates three separate moods. One mood that tells us it's a western with its upbeat unifying rhythm. The other mood being romantic gesture that our two main characters show for each other. Finally a mood that puts us on edge, always feeling like danger is around the corner. The setting really drives home our western mathsphere. Bringing home how vast and great our homeland is. Finally the cinematography, which helped developed a whole new shot known as the cowboy shot. Brings home the vastness of our setting and how great and strong our characters feel traveling around it's dangerous corners.\nStagecoach is a beautiful movie that uses all aspects of filmmaking to tell a story that is so strong that it not only was relatable to audiences when it came out but it still relates to audiences now. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. Just be careful with the some of the racist showcasing of native americans and mexicans in the film. For all its wonder it does have some faults and those are pretty strong. But it still holds up and even with those faults it is a remarkable movie that is charming and powerful.",

Many of the artistic details were well done such as cinematography (the black n white landscape worked well here), the song by the Indian, and the action scenes (for its time and special effects then). John Wayne plays his typical role of outcast who is both honorable and a badass. One of the great western classics. ",

But anyways, I noticed this list that was titled \"The Best Movie in Every State\", so out of my natural curiosity as a frequent movie viewer, I looked at the entire list.  And then wouldn't you know it, I saw that Stagecoach held the title of \" best\" movie ever filmed in Utah.  Therefore sparking enough of my already growing interest in watching this movie, that I actually sat down and almost watched it completely through.  And let me be the 14,467th person to tell you, that I was not disappointed for one bit of the film's entirety.  I mean like sure, the action set-pieces and fist fights may be few and far between, (there actually weren't any fist fights).  However, as I was saying, there weren't that many action set-pieces.  But nonetheless, the two of them delivered in the best possible ways.  And who knows, the Stagecoach battle scene with the Apache's, might very well have been \"the\" contributing factor and inspiration behind the chariot race scene in William Wyler's legendary, biblical epic, Ben-Hur.  \nUltimately though, while the Stagecoach battle was the undisputed highlight of the John Ford masterpiece, it is effortlessly outweighed in equal measure by the ever present story and it's appealing characters. The best part being, the multiple character moments, and John Wayne's terrific role as \"The Ringo Kid\".  By the way, the rest of the cast weren't any slouches, of course you already know why John Wayne is mentioned in his own sentence.  \nHowever anyways I guess it is time to conclude my review, so at an rate, \"Sionara\", I hope to be writing another review really soon.\n\nMy grade for the film: A",

A stagecoach sets off across the untamed wilderness carrying a mixed assortment of characters: an infamous outlaw, a drunk doctor, a prostitute, a whiskey salesman, the wife of an Army officer, a gambler, a bank manager, the local Marshall and the driver. Animosities and petty differences, and unexpected friendships, surface. Their fortunes take a turn for the worse when they learn that an Apache raiding party, lead by Geronimo, is in their vicinity.\n\nA masterpiece that is the most important Western ever made. Great plot, well directed by the legendary John Ford. Not just a conventional cowboys-vs-Indians / gunfight sort of Western (though there a large element of that) but a character drama too. There is great character depth and development on display and this is used well in developing the story.\n\nSome great themes running through the movie too, especially one of anti-prejudice.\n\nGood performances all round. John Wayne is great as the Ringo Kid and shows a softer side that wasn't always apparent in his later films. Thomas Mitchell deservedly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Doctor Boone.\n\nMore than just a brilliant movie, a movie that created the blueprint for Westerns, and pretty much defined the genre.\n\nIt also made John Wayne a star. He had acted in plenty of movies before this without much impact but Stagecoach is what truly launched his career as we know it.\n\nJohn Ford had already won a directing Oscar before directing Stagecoach, so this movie wasn't as career-enhancing to him as it was to John Wayne. However, it did set him up as the foremost director of Westerns. Moreover, it was to be the first of many collaborations with John Wayne, a series of collaborations that would see them make movies like The Searchers, Rio Grande, The Quiet Man, They Were Expendable, Fort Apache and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\n\nA brilliant and historic movie.",

Each character is briefly introduced and given a backstory, and their stories are further expanded upon while confined within the stagecoach. It is this alone that makes 'Stagecoach' the classic it is, so simple, yet so well-executed, and it proved a benchmark for the films to follow.\n\nMinor statements and prop-related reveals also add to the sophisticated development the story has to offer, some of which I missed first time around, thus giving us new material with each further viewing. From the \"just got a telegram\" that Gatewood utters (unleashing a flurry of distrust among the group) to the foreshadowing of death in the form of the dead man's hand in a poker game.\n\nHowever what really boasts this film as the technical marvel it is, is the films craft, sure the sound mix might be a little blown-out, but with stunning cinematography, beautiful vistas of Monument Valley (that Ford's films would later utilise time and time again), a score of epic proportions and stunt-work that outshines modern day action sequences (with the horse jumping during the chase scene leaving me in awe). Finally, we have the actors, who, despite some forced dialogue, all provide high calibre performances, Thomas Mitchell in particular who gives the film its comic element but also delivers some more heartfelt and caring drama at times of soberness, and of course, who can forget John Wayne's introductory zoom shot.\n\n'Stagecoach' might not live up to its later counterparts, but for a nearly-80-year-old picture, it does its damndest to provide sheer entertainment through its straightforward narrative and dazzling action sequences.",

The cast of characters on board are from all different walks of life and have lots of disputes. Naturally, by the end they must learn to set aside their differences and work together to make it through alive. I have to admit, I was never interested in this story. There are a number of story points that I know were explained, but I couldn't possibly tell you what happened because I was bored and distracted almost from the beginning of the film. There are brief moments that grabbed my attention, but it was never held for long. John Wayne was the big star, and I was interested to finally watch a movie starring him, but I didn't particularly like anything he did in this film. His love interest had a more intriguing story, and her relationship with the other riders was the most extreme. But my favorite character on the Stagecoach was the comic relief provided by Thomas Mitchell as the doctor. His constant imbibing was played well for laughs, and yet he was able to straighten up for a more serious scene too. The movie probably could have held my interest more if they met more obstacles along the way. Most of the film, though, was traveling in surprising safety until they had to stop. Then they hear about all the military protection that had left that location. Then they decide to move on again with a renewed dread. There was no mounting to the tension for me as a viewer because the threat of Geronimo seems just as imminent at the beginning as it was in the end. Plus the big confrontation doesn't take place until the very end, and by then I was completely checked out. Stagecoach is definitely not a film for me.",

            "content": "At last, people of 1939, John Ford makes his big comeback to the western genre he pioneered after a relatively sprawling hiatus of, like, four months or something. Ford made a lot of films, and arguably too many of them were westerns, but people were still excited when Ford got back into them after 13 years, especially when it turned out to also be his first western with sound. Oh yeah, because you just can't take John Wayne seriously unless you hear his voice... is what I'm saying \"in a sarcastic tone\" now that Wayne is tragically dead. Yeah, Wayne may have had that silly Iowa accent, but I still wouldn't have wanted to mess with him, especially when he was young and... well, about as fresh-faced as that thick forehead was going to allow him to be. I hope the people of the '30s were getting used to him, because this wouldn't be his last rodeo with John Ford, although Ford, not quite realizing that at the time, took a little while to get Wayne in this film's plot. Everyone rambles on about Wayne's presence, but remember, people, that, as the poster tagline will tell you, this is about \"9 strange people\", even though it's not exactly a \"powerful story\". You better believe that the film is decent, but don't entirely believe the praise they put into the poster, for a number of reasons.\r\n\r\nThis is something of a fluffy affair, with a light heart and humor that has, since 1939, grown dated and cheesy, with even the conflicts and plot being histrionic, maybe even out-and-out thin. If the narrative isn't superficial with its subtlety, it's simply superficial, with depth limitations that were all too common in fluffy flicks such as this one at the time, yet could be compensated for if it wasn't for developmental shortcomings. I reckon exposition is adequate, but there's little real attention to characterization which is already lacking in range altogether, partly because there is a little too much to flesh out in merely 96 minutes. This runtime isn't aggressively brief, but it's still a little too short for John Ford to have time to establish a firm sense of adventure, which is a crying shame, seeing as how the film doesn't have much going for it outside of the adventure. With all of my rambling about how thin storytelling is, superficiality is all but fitting, as the story concept, no matter how lively, is lacking in true meta and tension, of which there is still enough for the other shortcomings to kind of aggravate. With all my talk about how there's only so much to talk about in regards to this film, maybe storytelling could have been inspired enough to mold a rewarding western, as there are highlights in inspiration which reflect full potential, but in the end, whether it be because of the shortcomings of the time or simple missteps, the final product slips as an underwhelming, maybe even kind of forgettable classic. With that said, the effort holds enough of your attention to entertain plenty, perhaps even immerse with its visuals.\r\n\r\nThis is the first of John Ford's westerns to be shot in Monument Valley, which sees quite the breakout as a hot spot for western film art direction, being sweeping enough by its own right, and decorated well enough with timely production designs, to adventurously draw you into the time portrayed in and scope of this film. No matter how superficial the storytelling gets, production value at least succeeds in reinforcing a sense of adventure that this narrative ought to thrive on, seeing as how the plot concept is dynamic and subtly layered enough to potentially compensate for a lack of dramatic meat. That compensation is lost, but not entirely, for even Dudley Nichols's and Ben Hecht's script's tastes in colorful humor and set pieces have endured through all of the cheesy dating to entertain, even on paper. As for the execution, there is also something a little lacking about John Ford's direction, and yet, there is also enough color to the storytelling to hold your attention just fine, with style that is sometimes focused enough to hold some tension. Mind you, the tension only comes into play when the conflict stands, and make no mistake, conflict is limited, but it is there, and until it shows up, the film still proves to be an entertainingly well-told adventure, with its share of memorable plot points and characters. Of course, the characters might only be so relatively memorable because of their portrayals, which don't have much material to work with, and may even be a little dated, yet have stood the test of time well enough for just about everyone to charm with his or her own distinct charisma and, for that matter, chemistry, which drives comradery. Comradery is important in a film this adventurous, yet still so intimate, and no matter how thin characterization is, the performers draw you into the heart of this flick, but not alone, as there is also enough heart to dated storytelling to thoroughly entertain in a classic, if thin fashion.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there is some cheesily fluffy humor and plotting, which join developmental shortcomings in reinforcing a certain superficiality to the telling of an already borderline inconsequential story, thus, the final product falls as underwhelming, but through grand production value, reasonably colorful scripting and direction, and charismatic performances, a sense of adventure is done enough justice to make John Ford's \"Stagecoach\" a pretty fun western classic, despite its many shortcomings.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

            "content": "Ah... Stagecoach. The film that basically defined the Western genre, made director John Ford a household name, and was the film that made John Wayne one of the most successful Hollywood actors of all-time. But unlike many, including my uncle, who's a massive Wayne fan, I'm not the biggest fan of Wayne's films. In my perspective, there have been some that have been worth the hype (such as The Searchers and Rio Bravo), while other \"acclaimed classics\" I found were overrated (I'm looking at you, The Quiet Man!). When I finally managed to watch the first major film of \"The Duke\", I finally began to realize why John Wayne is an excellent actor and why he has many fans, including my uncle.\r\n\r\nStagecoach is about a group of people who people who travel together to a certain town on a stagecoach. The problem with the travel is that they are going through Indian territory and they have to watch out for possible attacks. Those on the stagecoach include a former prostitute (Claire Trevor), a pregnant wife (Louise Platt) who's husband is in the cavalry, a suspicious gambler (John Carradine), a drunken doctor (Thomas Mitchell), a nervous whiskey salesman (Donald Meek), a crooked banker (Berton Churchill), an always optimistic driver (Andy Devine), a protective sheriff (George Bancroft), and last but not least, the polite but tough criminal \"The Ringo Kid\" (John Wayne).\r\n\r\nThe thing about Stagecoach is that before Stagecoach was released, westerns were referred to as B-movies (kind of like the horror films at the time), and many weren't taken very seriously. But with Stagecoach, the addition of action, drama, comedy, and the mysteries of the characters made Stagecoach film that first changed the game of the western genre. While the story sounds like a simple clich\u00e9, in actuality, the reason why the film works so well is that while watching, you have to solve the mysteries of the characters' intentions to fully feel satisfied of the film.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of the characters, the actors playing the characters all do fine jobs in their roles. I won't go into full detail on everyone involved in the stagecoach, there's just so many to name, but before I fully go into John Wayne, the performances I really have to give a special shout-out to are Clair Trevor as the fallen prostitute, Louise Platt as the pregnant wife, and Thomas Mitchell, who won an Oscar for his role as the drunken doctor. Now, before Stagecoach, John Wayne had been involved in dozens of films, but wasn't going nowhere when it comes to recognition in Hollywood. When John Ford called Wayne in for the lead actor in Stagecoach, the producers hated the idea, instead wanting Gary Cooper to do the role of \"The Ringo Kid\". (Nope, I can't picture Sergeant York as The Ringo Kid). But Ford got his way and Wayne got the role, and it was a smart decision. Wayne truly nailed the role. He's tough, he's honest, he's polite to the ladies, and he knows how to solve problems. While I might not be the biggest Wayne fan, I do admit that Wayne can act remarkably well, and I honestly rank this as one of his best roles that I've seen (though arguably his greatest performance that I've seen still remains The Searchers).\r\n\r\nStagecoach was the first of many westerns where John Ford shot the film in Monument Valley, which is the borders of Arizona and Utah, and with each film, the locations are indeed excellent, with Stagecoach truly a standout. The scene that really gets me in an action sequence where the crew gets attacked by Indians. The stunts are unbelievable, and the camera angles are very unique for the time. Even the drama between the characters gets you, and when the film hits the comedic route, courtesy of Andy Devine as the driver, it's pretty funny. The score, which consists of American folk tunes, is excellent in terms of awe and excitement. \r\n\r\nWhile I admit that Wayne's shootout at the end was very anticlimactic, Stagecoach is truly an excellent western, with excellent performances, particularly Wayne in his first major role, Ford's fantastic direction, and a brilliant storyline. Now this is how you do a western!",
