            "content": "On a surface level, \"Rules of the Game\" seems deceptively trivial; even the comedy feels sporadic and inconsistent. The passive fashion in which the film regards sudden moments of tragedy and callousness is jarring, and we're left with a sense of a film that is figuring itself out in the process of unfolding. Yet looming in the background is our knowledge of the wartime carnage that was to come, and the uneven nature of the work produces a wholly unique impact when one accounts for Renoir's likely premonitions of the darkness facing the nation and indeed the world at large. Dialogue is generally casual and yet slyly revealing and insightful, and the playfully unorthodox choreography of the film hits right at the center of Renoir's mockery of superficial elegance. We laugh, we are shocked, we squirm, and we reflect. If ever there were a film stubbornly resistant to being pigeonholed in every technical, thematic, and aesthetic aspect, \"Rules of the Game\" surely fits the bill. Transcending such limitations, the film acquires an ability to increasingly dazzle us with repeated viewings, and is second to none in its capability of yielding up new revelations and insights every time.",

            "content": "Set in the days before the start of World War II, Jean Renoir's The Rules of the Game is a scathing satire of French aristocracy. Over the course of a weekend at an opulent country estate, the wealthy gather to indulge in infidelity, boorish behavior, hunting and, ultimately, murder, all under the watchful eyes of a plentitude of servants.  On a technical level, it is masterful.  The blocking of the shots is amazing, the editing is remarkable, and Renoir's subtle but effective camera movement is effective in capturing the antics of the characters.  If there is a fault with The Rules of the Game (is that cinematic sacrilege?), it is the size of the cast.  There are so many characters, many of whom seem to serve no purpose, that it is often difficult to determine the nature of the relationships.  On the bright side, things make more sense with a second viewing, which isn't always a bad thing.",

So it is with The Rules of the Game.  At a simple level it is an elaborate farce, similar but much inferior to its contemporaries such as Bringing Up Baby or His Girl Friday.  To decant The Rules of the Game means to put it in the context of pre-war France and to understand how scandalous, uncomfortable and innovative it was at that moment, and how it is,  unlike those two pure comedies, only superficially a farce, but really a challenge, an indictment, a deep critique of France's ruling class.  After several viewings the full weight of this film, all its aromas and flavors, begin to emerge.  Then, after absorbing the complexity of the story and the complexity of the shots, the full force of the film comes through.  There are many fine performances, with an outstanding and nuanced Dalio holding the center stage along with Renoir himself, but it is decidedly the director's unique creation.",

Renoir's master work stands on its own as an exceptional film. Yet you can't just help catching so many film tropes - screwball comedies, women's flicks, a sense of film noir. These are all seamlessly blended in to a a combination of \"Gosford Park\" and Downton Abbey\" with humor, desire, pathos, tragedy and ultimately a commentary on the human condition. Spectacular!",

            "content": "The Rules of the Game has the feeling of a stage play. A great deal of the film takes place in one house over the course of a couple days. There were a few scenes where it was clear they were leaning towards making this a comedy, because some of the characters are funny, but it never was humorous to the point of making me laugh. It\u2019s a shame because the rhythm of the film would have worked great as a rapid-fire comedy of manners, with all the characters walking in and out of assorted rooms having their own little conversations. Instead the film is much more invested in exploring the dramatic elements, with only a few brief exceptions. Sadly, the drama is straight out of a soap opera. I have no interest in any of these storylines. The cheating spouses, the scorned lovers, and all the bickering arguments are mind-numbing for me. If there was one protagonist who was above it all then perhaps I could connect with that person and endure the frustration of The Rules of the Game, but every character seems to be mired in a love triangle of some type. I know this kind of upstairs-downstairs drama is fascinating for some people, but I simply don\u2019t care. It\u2019s even more infuriating in this film because most of the characters put themselves into these situations. Everyone seems to actively work towards gathering all the lovelorn people under the same roof, as if they have no idea that this will be a disaster. It seems that everyone in The Rules of the Game behaves entirely on impulse. We have to sit through two hours of people who never think through a single thing they do. It\u2019s maddening at times, and I constantly found myself wishing someone would act with a little logic. Also, and I\u2019m sure this is a horrible thing for me to say, I struggled to see why every man in the film was falling head over heels for an unattractive and uninteresting woman. They treat Nora Gregor\u2019s character like some kind of goddess, which baffled me. All of that being said, I must admit that The Rules of the Game has a cohesive story with some twists and turns, so it wasn\u2019t all bad. The final scenes were almost Shakespearean, so at least it ended on a high note. But overall this clearly isn\u2019t a movie for me.",

While his characters are jovial enough in various social gatherings, they have no scruples, sincerity, or intellectual depth, and spouses cheat on one another not so much out of real passion or love for someone else, but out of ennui.  \"Sincere people are such bores,\" one says, reflecting a lack of values.  They calmly slaughter bunnies that have been driven towards them, considering it a \"hunt\", one laughs as he relates the story of a man who died in a self-inflicted gun accident, and later there is a remarkable lack of real concern or empathy when someone else is hurt (being vague on purpose).  They goof around sophomorically in front of servants, who clearly don't respect them, but the servants themselves also have their own infidelities.  In 'The Rules of the Game', there are very few real rules, just the entitlement to make up the rules that comes with wealth.  The characters are maddeningly unlikeable, and of course, that's the point.  \n\nRenoir does some interesting work with the camera in the film, putting it in motion almost as if it's a character or we're voyeurs into these scenes as the audience, but I think more is made of this than it should be.  Similarly, I don't put much in the fact that the film was made in 1939 and released less than a year before Germany invaded France; to me that seems more coincidence than Renoir's statement that it is a \"war film and yet there is no reference to the war.\"  As the action picks up in the second half, with guests scurrying around the chateau either to arrange for or break up trysts, it feels very much like a Hollywood screwball comedy from the period, with farcical elements and attempts at humor which aren't all that funny (e.g. the bear suit).  There's enough here to make the film watchable, but it's hard to understand how it ended up so highly regarded.",

This film's troubled history shows as much as the French mock/look down their noses at other societies, they are unable to laugh at themselves. Critics recommend multiple viewings of this movie, and they're probably right. There's a lot going on, and a lot to take in. After my first viewing, I found myself slowly immersed in the drama, but also a bit overwhelmed by the size of the cast and all the romantic intrigue. Like Citizen Kane, it is a great film, remarkable for its vision and influence, but might leave some wondering what was the big deal.",

Then it ends. What really shows that Renoir was just going through the motions is that though there aren't any special effects (I know, they didn't have those back then) there aren't even any places where you can tell he would put some if they had the technology.

Poor Andre, he did the whole plane journey over the Atlantic Ocean for a women he loves and she's not even there to welcome him. I'm glad he admitted how he really felt exclaiming,  \"She's disloyal!\" He seems like a pretty modest and humble dude as well. Mad respect. \n\nI admire dearly the restoration they achieved for this movie both visually and auditory, but it definitely shows it's age lol. you can tell it's an old movie form the 30's-40's. I like how charming and charismatic Lisette, their house maid, is. She seems like a pretty sharp cookie. Oh to be a rich high society cheating asshole. That's basically what Christine and her husband are. She tells him that she trusts him completely and immediately after he goes into the room to phone his mistress. The shame. The disloyalty. It's repugnant. And what a disgusting and haunting display of hunting for sport. That's high class society for you - taking pleasure in massacring animals. And boy did they kill a lot of rabbits and pheasants. \n\nAnother thing that annoys me of French cinema, and I guess something that is part of French culture, is how hopelessly romantic and over the top they can be, to the point where it's annoying. Like when the characters say, \"If I don't see my love again, I'll die. I'll parish into a million pieces and fade away into the universe.\" It's like dude, get over it. It's just a girl. There's plenty more out there. Like do you have to be so over the top? Lol. That's just my opinion.\n\nThe movie actually makes an interesting turnaround once the stage play with the ghosts and the skeleton suit guy start. The whole mansion begins to explode when husbands start to cheat with mistresses and wife's start to cheat with lovers. Fights break out and for those couple of minutes, the movie makes a turn around. But it barely makes up for the rest of the uneventful movie. \n\nI found it very hard to like any of these characters, or even remotely relate to any of them. It became a difficult watch for me. I felt like the pacing was chaotically fast at times. Dialogue felt like it was rushed. Watching this movie was a chore, it felt like a task and a half. I didn't really enjoy or care for most of it. I found the movie pretty boring and uninteresting. It was honestly really lame. A lot of the moments that I guess were supposed to be funny just ended up being either cringe or really lame. I actually started fast forwarding to get through it quicker around the middle mark of the movie. Overall, I wouldn't watch this movie again. Next.",

Over time it has grown into a classic, with seemingly every modern critic showering it with praise. Well, call me a stick in the mud, but it didn't work for me at all. I mean it REALLY didn't work. I understand its message: The upper class are amoral and contemptuous of those lower than them, and will do whatever they want with a devil-may-care attitude and to Hell with the consequences. I can see why it was so vilified by those it was taking a swipe at, because sometimes its peoples inability to understand a films themes that make it so hated. But what I really couldn't stand was the movies delivery. It has the non-stop, rambling dialogue often associated with 'classic' movies, and is completely unrelenting in throwing it at the audience. There's almost no moments of quiet when the film can breathe, it's all fast-paced, often benign chattering or loud music assaulting our ears at all times. None of the dialogue is very funny or even particularly insightful, and instead of scenes which subtly reveal the flaws and hypocrisies of the characters, we get loud, annoying, never-ending sequences of farce. Watching the majority of this film is like being forced to endure a Laurel & Hardy episode with the volume turned up full and the speakers positioned directly beside your head. All I felt by the end of this movie was tiredness and frustration. I'd learned nothing, got to know none of the characters, and was in almost total agreement with the critics who slammed it over 50 years ago. Near the end of the movie one of the characters turns to a friend and mentions 'putting an end to this farce', and I couldn't prevent myself from yelling 'PLEASE!'",

Nevertheless its hard to like a movie with such fake  characters, intended or not. Some of this also might be hard for me to relate to at least (like having mistresses) since it was set so long ago and I've never really been around people like this who have way too much money and time on their hands. I prefer other classics that are more relatable. Shame the one actress killed herself, you could tell she had a lot of talent and could connect well with camera.",

The fluid \"dancing of the camera\", the use of deep spaces to de-centre and complicate the action, and the rhythmic cuts from scene to scene, combine to create a cinematic experience that is not simply watched; rather absorbed. The film is often cited as one of the greatest in the history of cinema, and it absolutely lives up to the hype. A timeless masterpiece of writing, acting, directing and everything really.",

Even if you missed those elements of the film, though, you would still have a very entertaining and clever satire of high society. \n\nThe plot weaves together plot lines that are quite simple in and of themselves - almost every story is about someone's affair with someone else - into a complicated and funny series of escalating intrigues. In his introduction (made many years later), Renoir cites a couple of French authors I didn't know as influences, but one name of his I did recognize was Moliere, and indeed I can see the general resemblance. At first the movie might seem a bit tame, but as the characters become more and more uninhibited, the film becomes pretty wild indeed.\n\nI won't describe the performances much, since they were by a bunch of 1930s French actors you've never heard of anyway, but they are all good. The characters are all fairly simple, being as they are the targets of the film's satire. Renoir's visual style is great in subtle ways that contribute to the narrative. He does a lot of camera movements that were not usual at the time, and does some amazing things with deep-focus photography to rival Welles's work in Citizen Kane. The house where the film is set is very large, and we often see different plotlines advancing clearly in the fore-, middle-, and back-grounds. Renoir was in many ways light-years ahead of his time.\n\nApparently, the film's satire was so offensive at the time that it was widely banned, and Renoir mentions in his introduction a man who was so outraged that he attempted to burn the theater down at a screening. It's pretty amazing for any film to elicit such a response, especially one as light and playful on the surface as this one. I guess Renoir must have made his point pretty effectively without being heavy-handed. I definitely have the feeling I'll be rewatching and studying this one several times in the future.",

The hunting scene has to be one of the most powerful scenes , not only of the film, but of all time.

Clever as Renoir's message is about the folly of society punishing those who do not conform to its own ludicrous conventions (breaking the rules of the game, as it were), the lunacy of some of the comedy is a tad misdirecting from the fact that there is in fact a message to be gleaned. More notable (to my mind) is Renoir's use of camera movement and well-timed editing. In terms of visual flow, it leaves most of its contemporaries in the dust. The storied history of the film surpasses the actual film itself for memorability; Critically trashed upon release, censored by France's government for fear of disheartening citizens of a Nazi-occupied country, released internationally eleven years later in a mindlessly truncated form, and at last being restored to  near-completion in 1961.",

It seems that the film, like \"La Dolce Vita,\" also touches upon a common pattern, most notably vices, in human behavior that always goes unnoticed. This feat makes works like \"La Regle De Jeu\" not only timelessly entertaining but also essential for every generation to watch and to absorb. \r\n\r\nSadly, time has made the silent, meticulous pace of the film to be somewhat outdated. Some of its humorous commentary on the insensitive, ignorant behavior of higher French society (which I more than joyfully found parallels in my own society,) that ranged from childish, impulsive jealousy, to meaningless barrages of decontextualized flirting, to straight up fucking murder, may also seem subtle and toned-down by today's standards. The film could be slow at points.  After sucking you into the lives of its subjects and creating a perpetually innocent environment of a trivial house party, it was quite difficult to sense a noticeable escalation in the film's plot as it delicately builds itself through the gossip and bickering of the characters. In spite of these few arbitrary faults, \"La Regle De Jeu\" is still, holistically, a substantially enriching experience.",

Andr\u00e9 Jurieux, a famous aviator has just landed his plane and is welcomed by hoards of reporters and fans, congratulating him on his successful voyage. However, out of the range of the microphones, he is told that the woman he did this all for has struck up a relationship with another man, and has not even come to greet him at the airfield. This marks the beginning of the film's journey. After several interactions between mutual friends' mutual friends, it finally comes about that Andr\u00e9 Jurieux must spend several days in a large country house, staying with the lover who jilted him, her new man, a young poacher, the already-married maid whom he falls in love with and a great deal more people. We nevertheless start to focus less on Andr\u00e9, and more on everyone else, as we begin to understand what Renoir himself's character exclaimed: \"The awful thing about life, is that everybody has their reasons.\" Towards the end, on the final night, is when a larger than life party is being held. This is when the conflicts themselves become larger than life, the chaos even stretching to a guest chasing another around the house with a rifle.

But that's just it, that's exactly why it is so respected within the canon of film.\r\nLanguidly it builds.  For a while I wondered where exactly the film was going and struggled with it so, but once this main group got together and I could see the way Renoir had maneuevered all of this to happen, the scenes really started to crackle for me.  Directorially, so many scenes stand out with their pacing and composition; they compliment his written word so well that it's like watching a magic trick unfold that you can't quite place why it holds you in awe and makes your jaw drop at the same time.  The film's strength is its subtlety (even with its stand-out humor); which made a patsy out of even a film lover/aesthete like me for a while, watching it for the first time.

It reminded me of the way Gen-X films create their characters and their interactions, and it also reminded me of The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie.  It starts out with a Andre Jurieux who just flew the furthest distance across the Atlantic since Charles Lindbergh. It should be an amazing moment for him. People are there to cheer him on and everyone is happy for him, but the woman he did it for doesn't show up, which makes him the most disappointed man in the world. All these people around, but none of them really matter. What a selfish little brat. This sets us up for the rest of the characters. We know we're not getting into a comedy of people we would want to be friends with. These are the people that we like to make fun of. Christine is married to Cheyniest, but has had an affair with Andre. When she finds out he has had an affair with Genevieve she is upset and says her last three years have been based on a lie. It seems like all of these people react in such a strange way. Cheyniest is upset that Christine has fooled around with Andre, but he was ok to be fooling around with Genevieve. I liked at first Christine is ok with Genevieve and tells her to stay, but that's when she has the possibility of loving Andre and moving along with him. Octave, played by Renoir, was my favorite character. He seems to be in the middle of these confrontations, but he doesn't want the love for himself. Throughout the film we can see that Octave loves Christine more than just a sister, but doesn't do anything because he is the one who truly loves her. And I loved when Andre explains to Christine that he will have to explain to Cheyniest about them leaving because those are the rules of the game. He is a true hero, as Octave points out. Then Cheyniest meets a man poaching on his property whom he then hires for odd jobs at the chateau. This man falls in love with Christine's maid who is married to the guard of the property. They don't get along from the start. It's funny, neither of these men are rich, but they defend their honor more than anyone else in the film (other than Andre).\n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nI was so scared that Octave was going to get shot by the guard. He is so funny and lovable in the beginning, then so pathetic and sad in the end. He is the best character in the film, so killing him would have been devastating. It's still devastating that he decides to send Andre instead of himself to Christine even though they declared their love for each other. This saves his life, but Andre dies, and Octave still leaves for Christine to be happy. Her servant tells him that she wouldn't be happy with him because he doesn't have the money or success. This is all told bluntly after he is already vulnerable and telling Christine that he was never successful. The Rules of the Game is comedic, heartfelt, and pokes fun with a purpose. Jean Renoir was decades ahead of his time and makes it better than they do today.",

The satire, the multiple, simultaneously crossing storylines, the abundance of characters with ensemble acting, action on several planes at the same time, the moving camera. The bite of the vision. An essential landmark of cinema and an historically important portrait of the French upper-class on the brink of the World War II.",

However, this is in ways like Howard Hawks' \"The Big Sleep\" since that film is beyond confusing, but it is incredible entertaining. \"The Rules of the Game\" falls into the same category. There are at least two or three love affairs, is what I can for certain tell you, within this film, and most of these affairs disintegrate by the end or even, by the middle. To me, the plot doesn't matter. What matters is how well filmed, acted, and fresh this movie is. There are some great scenes. First, the beginning in which the plane arrives after, apparently, a 22 hour flight across the Atlantic Ocean flown by a single person. It is a small, army plane. Second, the second hunting scene (there are two) in which all the characters come together to chase and kill rabbits and pheasants. Third, the stage performance and party scenes in which there are some stunning set pieces, plus the chaos involving the deranged guard with the gun. Finally, the tragic conclusion (which I will not describe for spoiler related reasons). This is a fascinating early French film and perhaps, one of the best films from the 1930's.",

            "content": "I have noticed that my reviews have been getting less readers lately. Does it upset me? No not really, since I think it is because so many of the reviews I do are of films that aren't made for mass comsumption(and btw, I do like a movie that is just entertaining, so I don't consider myself one of those film snobs). I enjoy all kinds of movies, but I have the feeling that many of the people who are my \"friends\" on RT are stuck inside a genre or just like present day Hollywood films. That's OK. I would rather have one friend who likes and likes to discuss all types of films than 10 friends who only are interested in the typical Hollywood fare. And I don't want to offend anyone, but I will be deleting friends who don't respond to my reviews soon. I respond to everyone who sends me something, and if you don't respond at all, then I don't feel if I want to waste my time. Not a judgement, but I really want to concentrate on a smaller number of people who I can relate to. \r\n\r\nNow, this brings me to the point and the review. Many reviewers and friends who think that Jean Renoir's film \"The Rules of the Game\" is one of the greatest films ever made are people who I want to be friends with. Even people who are intrigued, try it and don't necessarily love it are still people I want to be friends with. I love a good disagreement with another person who I respect as a lover of the art of filmmaking. What really bugs me are \"the haters\". People who are so out and out hostile toward a film that they make it a personal attack on the artist, the film and anyone who loves it(using words like film snob or moron directed to anyone who likes it). I have the feeling that there was a great deal of this happening in 1939 during its original release. In fact, people were so hostile toward this film that the studio cut the film up, destroyed the footage taken out and re-released it later(Renoir was smart though and saved all the negatives and years later restored it to the original version). Today, I can see that most people will still be quite hateful toward this movie. Too bad. This is so much more than your typical Hollywood film, which usually follows a hero who will sacrifice all to protect and serve. The Hollywood structure is well used and very successful because it increases the involvement with the audience because they can relate to it. That is fine, but any hostility toward something different sometimes leaves me stunned.\r\n\r\nOk, back to the film. I love this movie because it is a study of manners and mores of pre-WWII France. The film is about a house party given by a French aristocrat and his Viennese wife and deals with the wives and husbands, lovers and adulterers, masters and servents who roam through rooms, hallways and the magnificient groudns of the estate. All of the movement and sneaking around in others bedrooms and the arms of lovers other than the one they are \"with\" is still seen as respectable and OK by many of the characters. What fun! No? Oh?\r\n\r\nWell, many will find this slow, episodic and aimless, but someone who has an eye for a true masterpiece will find it all quite fascinating. Renoir moves the characters in ways that, even today, will be rarely seen(I think of Altman when watching this). The actors are always acting, moving and continously in the foreground and background while the main action takes place up front. Everything seems to move so gracefully throughout the house and this was years before the \"steadicam\" came into existence.\r\n\r\nAll of it is so full of \"goodies\" that it will certainly be difficult for the less trained film lover, but the flawless choreographed moments of the characters will give a small number of viewers a trascendental experience. Those are the lucky ones. I love this movie and will watch it again. The only question is, \"how many RT will I lose after this review\"? Popularity contests don't belong in art. lol.",

Before I had seen this movie, I thought it was a critic of the bourgeoisie, but I found it more to be a sceptical view on human-beings in general. The overall attitude towards class differences in \"The Rules of the Game\" is that 'You should stick to your own social class', which Renoir sarcasticly deplicts with a great sense of humour and idioteque.\n\nI love how the camera finds it way through the different floors of the estate and how equally grotesque and bizar the whole house of people seem.",

And does it fulfill all these expectations? Yes. \r\n\r\nIt's like a very serious \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" in that it's a door-slamming farce without laughs that satirizes the upper class by showing how their actions (in this case various love triangles) have no consequences. \r\n\r\nDirector Jean Renoir, just like his other masterpiece The Grand Illusion, doesn't show any visual talent that would rank him among the greatest directors ever (though there is a fantastically photographed rabbit/fowl hunting scene), but instead creates a perfect drama and romance that works as a cinematic play. It's this drama and romance that holds your interest and draws you in throughout the film's somewhat lengthy running time. His style is both realistic, intelligent, and overall hard hitting.\r\n\r\nAlso, just like The Grand Illusion, all of the performances are exceptional, which makes it difficult to single out one performance in particular. If I were to do that though, my choice would actually be Jean Renoir himself, who plays corpulent and eccentric \"Octave\", who is stuck in the middle of all the drama and acts as an advisor to everyone.\r\n\r\nThe Rules of the Game is the definite cinematic drama and manages, more than many other films, to remain as emotionally resonate as it was when it was made. 101/100",

            "content": "The fact The Rules of the Game was almost lost forever is a scary thought, especially considering the impact it had on film and many directors. Robert Altman even said he \"learned the rules of the game from The Rules of the Game.\" And it's hard to argue its significance. You know you're seeing something special when the cinematography of a 1939 film seems fresh and inventive by today's standards; when there isn't any overacting during a time when movies were plagued by it; when, although it was hated and criticized and nearly destroyed after its initial release, it still managed to be restored and became to be considered one of the greatest films ever made.\n\nNo joke: on a critic's poll conducted by \"Sight & Sound\" magazine in 2002, it was ranked only behind Citizen Kane and Vertigo. Not bad if you ask me. But one can sit around all day and say it's an all-time great film. Why is it? Praising its strengths shows it is a great movie, but considering the time it was made, it makes everything seem that much more astonishing.\n\nFirst of all, the boldness of the film is unmatchable. Director Jean Renoir took a huge risk with his darkly comic look into French society and relationships. As funny as the film can be, it owns a rather depressing and pessimistic tone that left French audiences and critics in outrage. The film follows close to nine different characters who cannot seem to decide who they would like to court with. Andr\u00c3\u00a9, a pilot with his \"head in the clouds,\" loves Christine, but Christine is married to Robert, the wealthy and confident collector who seems to understand the \"rules of the game.\" Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve, Robert's mistress, is almost suicidal in her head-over-heels love for Robert. Then there's Marceau, the low-class outsider who chases after Lisette. Lisette welcomes his on-comings, despite her marriage to her dangerously envious husband Edouard. In the middle of it all is Octave, who never seems to be chasing anybody and manages to stay irreversibly happy (almost) the whole time.\n\nAny aspiring filmmaker should study the movie's climax, the scene where all the characters gather for a night that is reminiscent of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\" Characters change partners and squabble with each other increasingly throughout the night. The most impressive part of this scene is its flow. The writing is part of the reason. Ranging from laugh-out-loud funny to darkly disturbing, the characters engage in conversations that really bring their situations into light.\n\nThe characters' approach marriage and fidelity with nonchalance. Or, more accurately, they appear nonchalant. But there are hints of their true feelings throughout the film before everything erupts in the end. Take the scene where Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve speaks with Robert on the phone. She tries to make plans, but Robert denies her because of plans he owns with Christine. Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve appears to not care, but as soon as she places the phone back in its cradle the hurt sets in on her face. Christine pulls a similar maneuver. Speaking with Robert in his study, she refers to divorce as being \"melodramatic.\" However, when she learns of Robert's relationship with Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve, she starts to entertain thoughts of leaving him for Andr\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nThe true reason to relish in the climax is the camerawork. The flow of this scene is determined by how gracefully Renoir moves from room to room and connects all the conflicts so fluidly. We see Eduardo chasing Marceau, which leads right to Christine speaking with Robert, which leads to Octave desperately searching for someone to help get his bear costume off, which leads to Andr\u00c3\u00a9 finding Christine and Robert together. Everything transitions so well that you never lose track of each story and the struggles of each character.\n\nOne other scene will undoubtedly capture the viewer's attention for years to come, in which the party goes out on a hunting expedition and shoot down dozens of rabbits and birds. Renoir does not hold back and shows rabbits running along and suddenly flipping over or falling limp to the ground. In particular, one rabbit lingers onto its life for a brief five seconds, in which we see its paws shaking and finally unfolding into nothingness. As shocking and impressive as the scene is, it refers to a grander statement about French society and how they selfishly cut down each other for the thrill of the hunt. The hunting scene also hints at the events that will unfold at the party, where Renoir's message will hit viewer's right in the heart.\n\nAnd I think that's the point: Renoir wasn't looking to outrage French audiences, but instead expose those deep feelings burning underneath with compassion. Obviously, they didn't take it too kindly. Nevertheless, the movie exists today and even has its own Criterion Collection edition. Perhaps the most impressive thing about The Rules of the Game is it has just as much impact as it did in 1939, not only in its film making style, but also in its ability to remind us of those feelings we sometimes try to hide. \n\nRead more reviews at http://cinemabeans.blogspot.com/",
