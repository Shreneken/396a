Epic Civil War drama focuses on the life of petulant Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara. Starting with her idyllic life on a sprawling plantation, the film traces her survival through the tragic history of the South during the Civil War and Reconstruction, and her tangled love affairs with Ashley Wilkes and Rhett Butler.",

The cinematography was not only evolutionary for the time but has been regarded as some of the best cinematography in cinema ever since its release. Vivian Leigh (Scarlett O'Hara) and Clark Gable (Rhett Butler) gave brilliant performances with Vivian winning the Oscar for best Actress in a leading role. Alongside Vivian, Hattie McDaniel (Mammy) won the Oscar for best supporting actress and in doing so became the first African American to be nominated for and win an Academy award. The film also won 6 other oscars, 5 of which were behind the camera awards (Best Directing, Best Writing/Screenplay, Best Cinematography/Colour, Best Art Direction and Best Film Editing) the 6th Oscar the film won was Best Picture. After watching the film it is clear that the film deserved every award they won.",

            "content": "An epic. Gone With the Wind is another technicolour achievement from the same director who brought us \"The Wizard of Oz\". It's a romantic tragedy which is set against the backdrop of the American Civil War and Reconstruction era, elevated by Max Steiner's score, some beautiful set design, landscape scenes and cinematography, a strong supporting cast, and a powerhouse lead performance from Vivian Leigh. Perhaps it's overly long with some scenes overstaying their welcome; that would be my main criticism.\n\nA lot has been made of the depiction of the Antebellum South as well as that of slaves at that time in history. While there is merit to some of the criticism, I believe works of art should be judged as products of their time. Also, the film is based on a fictional romantic novel set against the backdrop of a real conflict, so I believe the creators are allowed to take some creative liberties with their work. The film isn't claiming to be historically accurate, and shouldn't be treated as such. For all its faults, it's a part of cinematic history, and should be preserved, not cancelled.\n\n\n\nNobody watches this film for historical accuracy.",

            "content": "Running at 233 minutes, \"Gone With the Wind\" with all it's technical problems and casting issues is a long film that never once loses it's footing and undeniably holds the viewers attention from beginning until the closing credits! The film was being produced alongside \"The Wizard of Oz\" (also 1939) but unlike the latter, was assured to be a grand and acclaimed work in Hollywood almost from the beginning. \"The Wizard of Oz\" of course is also a timeless masterpiece but one that also didn't have the extraordinary budget and cast as \"Gone With the Wind\". Clark Gable plays the wealthy but rough and lively aristocrat Rhett Butler and the gorgeous Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara alongside an enormously gifted and delightful cast of character actors and other actors, all of which deliver impeccable performances here.\n     The film begins before the Civil War during a lighthearted and decadent time of prosperity in the South, when the war finally breaks out destroying this tranquility. Over years of fighting and the defeat of the South, the O'Haras are left with nothing but the tattered remains of Tara (the families plantation). Scarlett must learn to grow up fast and becomes the head of the family and must pick up the pieces. Scarlett takes her life and that of her families into her hands and the fate of Tara resides solely with her will and sacrifices along the way.\n     There are some very iconic quotes and mesmerizing scenes in the film and even 75 years later, they continue to astound and arrest viewers to this day. There are many scenes that demonstrate a tremendous visual scope and are still beautiful to watch, especially considering the little known three strip Technicolor that was being utilized with minimal testing. Some of the greatest and most poignant scenes include the burning of Atlanta, the street shots of the dead and injured Confederate soldiers which utilized a stunning crane shot (in a film that used very little camera movement), and the silhouette of Scarlett O'hara vow \"As God as my witness, I'll never go hungry again\". \"Gone With the Wind\" is a story of hope and redemption, what may appear to be the end and insurmountable is only at that particular moment, there's always tomorrow. \"Gone With the Wind\" went on to win 10 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actress (Vivien Leigh), and Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel, the first African-American to win an Oscar). It is also currently ranked #6 on The American Film Institute's Top 100 Films of All Time.",

It's clear to all the characters, and the viewer, on how flawed Scarlett O'Hara is; but despite that, you can't help but fall in love with her and root for her. That's the beauty of great story telling; to make you sympathize and understand a character you wouldn't otherwise. To call it a masterpiece is an understatement. And by the way, Melanie is the purest angel I've ever seen in film. She reminds me of my wife.",

The film certainly can't escape responsibility for such an indulgence, but the educated and enlightened mind can look upon it in a state of wonder regarding the universally relatable strengths which the film does possess. The timeless romance between Scarlet and Rhett has been pondered exhaustively, but the the enduring brilliance of the film derives from a scope which extends well beyond the parameters of their relationship. One might realize, for example, that the film offers a striking commentary on the nature and importance of resilience when life would seem at its most hopeless, as well as a blistering commentary on the thoughtless cruelty that we are capable of inflicting upon one another when in the moments of our deepest pain. In the end, we can't help but draw strength from Scarlet's stubborn and even selfish resilience, realizing in the process that even the seemingly weakest and most petty among us hold the keys to our own salvation. \"Gone with the Wind\" thus works not merely as an operatic ode to a troubling time that has receded into the pages of our history books, but also as an affirmation of what it means to consider tomorrow as another day.",

The year is 1861, and sixteen-year-old Scarlett O'Hara is infatuated with the blond, drowsy-eyed Ashley Wilkes - the problem is, Ashley plans to marry another woman. Little matter that every other man in the county is courting Scarlett and that a charming scoundrel named Rhett Butler is staring at her with questionable intent - she cares only for Ashley.\n\nSuddenly, the Civil War brakes out, changing the fates and fortunes of all. Scarlett, clever, manipulative, and charming, proves an adept survivor - but what will she have to do to survive? And will she ever learn whom it is that she really loves?\n\nGWTW is one of the most meticulously cast films ever; with the possible exception of Leslie Howard as Ashley (in his forties, rather old to be playing a man half that age), every role was perfectly assigned. After you watch Vivien Leigh you will be unable to imagine anyone else playing Scarlett, and Hattie McDaniel's strong, unforgettable performance as \"Mammy\" netted her an academy award (the first for an African-American actor).\n\nGWTW's backdrop is the gruesome Civil War, and in the end this film is the story a woman and a civilization (the Old South) going through a war that will not leave either of them unchanged.\n\nThe cinematography is beautiful, memorable. Gone With the Wind was shot entirely in gorgeous technicolor; the scene of the fire in Atlanta required the use of all eight technicolor cameras in existence at the time.\n\nThe pragmatic may think Gone with the Wind overly dramatic; the restless may find it too long; the action-stimulated, too subtle. None of this, however, detracts from the fact that GWTW retains a lasting appeal as one of the crowning cinematic achievements of the 20th century. Those who see its ending as depressing - tragic, even - perhaps miss the point - which Scarlett O'Hara makes in her very last instant with us, tear-stained eyes uplifted in a sudden, curious burst of hope beneath all the turmoil; that .. . \"After all, tomorrow is another day.\"",

I think it is more important to watch a film like this to get an idea what it was like in 1930s America and how comfortable enough people were with elevating such a distorted view of history, even if understandably, as it provided a view which allowed many of these same people to keep from having to confront their families horrific pasts.

Scarlett (Vivien Leigh) is a temperamental and vain Southern Belle from the Tara plantation who experiences the ups and downs in marriage, practices in medicine, deaths in the family, motherhood, and optimism. In spite of her courage and passion, she's spoiled and childish as she consumes riches and fashion and denies that the Civil War will occur. She reaches the first step of maturity when she witnesses the casualties of her father (Thomas Mitchell), her mother (Barbara O'Neill), Melanie (Olivia de Havilland), Charles Hamilton (Rand Brooks), her daughter Bonnie Blue (Cammie King Conlon), and thousands of Confederate soldiers. When Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) comes into the picture, she pushes him aside, seeing him as an interference to her social status. In reality, the weakness is her failure to wake up from her misguided romances and her insecurities. After the death of Melanie, she finally pulls the wall of her eyes and intervenes with Rhett, who leaves her and utters, \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\" The majority of Scarlett's torment is stemmed from her constant death experiences, her fantastical expectations of romance, and her maturity progression. It was a long and difficult step for Scarlett to grow up, but in the end, the wind would have consumed her along with her family otherwise. Furthermore, Scarlett O'Hara shooting a Yankee in the face was friggin' awesome. \n\n(5 Yankees Shot by Scarlett out of 5)",

We cannot change the past, but we can learn from it. It seems ridiculous now how some people were slaves and the others were their ladies and lords. You are all the same being! Get over yourself. \nI love the acting in this movie, especially the starring characters. It was a good 4 hours. And it was nice to see that even though times are changing, human emotions basically stay the same.",

First, let's address what everyone has addressed in recent times: its racial depictions. Personally, I take no offense to the racial depictions found within this film. It's not that I think they would fit well in society today, nor that I condone them, but I feel that it's unfair to hold a film made over eighty years ago to the same standards we hold films today. However, I can see why some people would take offense. These cultural depictions are outdated, and it's worth acknowledging that.\n\nHowever, that is no reason to hate this amazing, beautiful, epic, and poetic film, nor is there reason to ignore the overwhelming merits and influence of this film. The acting is superb, the story captivating, the characters compelling, the visuals stunning \u2013 this film does everything perfectly. It really is a masterpiece. The best way to describe this film would be \"poetry in motion\"... this film feels like one long poem, and it's done perfectly. In my opinion, this is the greatest film ever made, and I absolutely love it.\n\nAgain, it is worth acknowledging the historical context of this film, and that some of its cultural depictions are outdated, but that should not preclude anybody from enjoying it, nor from acknowledging its merits. This film remains a cinematic golden standard, and I hope this film remains cherished for generations to come.",

Every darn scene has a climactic song screaming \"This is the greatest scene in the greatest movie ever.\" Scarlett and father go walking: crescendo theme song and dazzling costumes.  But  I gotta give this 2 stars: it isn't awful.  It's huge, the cast is perfect.  It's just like eating an entire 3-tier wedding cake at one time and feeling sort of stuffed and sleepy at the end. And the Rhett-rapes-Scarlett scene:  Ugh or maybe not...you decide.  But racism all over the place. Then again, great score.  Vivian Leigh great, but better in \"Streetcar Named Desire\".  Clark Gable gives his performance of a lifetime. And if it all gets too painful to watch, just put some scissors under your seat cause that cuts the pain in half.",

I don't see how anyone could care about this woman... I mean, yes she's gorgeous, and she's got gumption, but Scarlett is just a whiny, petulant child. She doesn't grow up, even by the end. Gable adds a cynicism that is quite refreshing, especially where it ultimately leads the story. It is however quite the epic, and considering its age, that's pretty impressive.",
