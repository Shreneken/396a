    "summary": "When the idealistic young Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) winds up appointed to the United States Senate, he gains the mentorship of Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains). However, Paine isn't as noble as his reputation would indicate, and he becomes involved in a scheme to discredit Smith, who wants to build a boys' campsite where a more lucrative project could go. Determined to stand up against Paine and his corrupt peers, Smith takes his case to the Senate floor.",

            "content": "1939 was one of those insane years for film. A decade plus after The Jazz Singer ushered in talkies, Hollywood found itself in the midst of a Golden Age. It was the tail end of the Great Depression, and World War II was on the horizon. At 23 cents a ticket, the cinema was an escapist treat that the average man could enjoy. \n\n1939 produced at least four of the greatest films ever made. Frank Capra made one of them. John Ford made another. And Victor Fleming made two. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was the 18th talking picture directed by Frank Capra. It's a David and Goliath story set in the world of politics. The Washington DC setting makes the film timeless. The Capital building, Lincoln Memorial, and Senate floor stand today just as they stood in the 1930s.\n\nPolitics has always been entertaining. It's the art of rhetoric that Plato wrote about. Rhetoric is when a speaker tries to inform, persuade, or motivate members of an audience. Mr. Smith has a lot of talking and James Stewart is a force of acting nature in the third act. This is the role that made Jimmy a star and there's a good reason for it.\n\nAs much as I love Capra and Stewart, the main reason that Mr. Smith succeeds is because of Sidney Buchman's screenplay. This is the era of screwball comedy and the film often plays like one. There are stirring speeches, detailed exposition, and amazing dialogue. Jean Arthur gets the best lines as Clarissa Saunders. She's smart, witty, and complicated. She has to help Jefferson Smith and show him the ropes even though it feels like babysitting. \"Look, Senator, I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is.\" \n\nShe's a great female architype. Now Buchman wasn't the only writer. Lewis Foster wrote the story for Mr. Smith and even won an Academy Award for Best Original Story. The story here is somewhat complicated. While proposing a bill to buy land for a national boy's camp, Jeff Smith stumbles upon a corrupt arrangement between Senator Paine and political boss James Taylor (not the singer).\n\nPaine wants government money to build a dam in Willet Creek. Paine tips off Taylor who then buys the land in advanced so he can charge the government an exorbitant price for the property. This is a graft scheme. It's unclear to me if Paine's bill is a straight forward appropriation bill or if Paine is hiding the dam fund in a laundry list of other expenditures. I think it's the latter. The problem isn't whether or not the dam is a good idea. Montana is big enough for a dam and a boy's camp. But when Paine opposes the camp it looks suspicious. \n\nPaine doesn't know how to oppose the bill without revealing his deal with Taylor. Paine and Taylor bribe Smith with any job he wants but Smith refuses. The duo then accuses Smith of already owning the Willet Creek land and thus trying to profit off it. They forge Smith's signature on some documents. This is the only part of the movie that's a stretch. Who did Smith allegedly buy the land from? If Smith does own the 500- acre land can't he just donate it to the boy's camp? \n\nSmith, however, is too distraught by Paine's corruption to ask these questions. Perhaps Paine and Taylor knew that Smith would be too inexperienced to prove them wrong. The Senate meets to discuss Paine's bill and Smith knows that this is his last chance to speak because the next item of discussion will be Smith's termination. Smith decides to filibuster for 24 hours with the hope that Paine will confess to the dam scheme. Now Smith and Taylor are from the same part of Montana. \n\nTaylor, who is well connected and owns all of the newspapers, has ordered the press to report negatively about Smith and never mention the Willet Creek dam. Saunders tries to counter this by getting the Boy Rangers paper to print the truth about Smith but ultimately, they are threatened into silence by Taylor's minions. I apologize for the plot summary but the complexity of the story is a big reason the movie holds up so well. \n\nPaine and Smith's father used to be good friends. Smith admires Paine and looks up to him. Paine tries to use his influence over Smith to persuade his voting. When this doesn't work, Paine betrays him. I guess he's living up to his name. It doesn't take long for the press to see the governor's hiring of Smith for what it is. \"You're not a Senator. You're an honorary stooge,\" proclaims one reporter. The press is right. They know that Smith was hired to be a \"Christmas Tiger\" that nods his head yes and no. \n\nThe shade throwing is relentless. Smith has to earn his seat at the table. This film is about the hero's journey from boy to man. It's a tried and true formula that hits all the major plot points: the rise, the fall, the all-is-lost moment, the return, and the victory. Paine says to Smith, \"You've been living in a boy's world Jeff and for heaven's sake, stay there. This is a man's world. It's a brutal world, Jeff, and you've no place in it.\" Paine is right. In Smith's current naive state, he has no place. \n\nWhen Smith first proposes the bill he's a nervous wreck with a shaky voice. He can hardly get through it. I always enjoy it when great actors are forced to act bad in a scene. It's a good contrast for later on. \"Liberty is too precious a thing to be buried in books, Miss Saunders.\" James Stewart isn't even the secret weapon of the film. He's exactly what he needs to be. The color red doesn't need to know why it's on the painter's brush, it simply needs to produce red when it's called upon. \n\nMr. Smith could have been a dull affair but Capra keeps the film humming with excellent pacing. There's a fast-paced montage of DC scenery and newspaper headlines, and there are smaller character moments. There are no stock characters here, each one is well rounded and has believable motives. Writer John Gautereaux said it best, \"Regardless of one's position in life, Capra made all men and women feel like they could obtain a piece of the American pie, if not bake it.\"",

            "content": "\"Look, when I came here, my eyes were big blue question marks. Now they're big green dollar marks.\" \n\nFrank Capra sends Jimmy Stewart and his down-home 'gee whiz' naivety to go head to head with compromised ideals and political corruption in Washington. \nSure it's sappy, sentimental (particularly the scene of Jimmy's visit to the Lincoln memorial) and oh so patriotic but it's also kind of hard not to be won over by the lead's honesty and integrity in the face of ridicule and dirty deeds. \n\nHowever I am not sold of the merits of a filibuster no matter how powerful Jimmy's speech may be. Here it is presented as a tool for the common man to fight the powerful, but methinks it would be just as an effective tool for the elite to squelch progress - as in Strom Thurmond's 1957 Filibuster against the Civil Rights act.  \nMel Gibson and Homer Simpson collaborate on a remake to 'Mr Smith Goes To Washington' in a season 11 episode of The Simpsons entitled   'Beyond Blunderdome'. \n\nLook for the Australian remake coming soon: Ms Lambie goes to Canberra",

            "content": "James Stewart and Frank Capra. One needn't know much more going in to be assured that this will be an enjoyable film. Together they take on the Washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a na√Øve Washington outsider who gets appointed to the Senate and stands alone against corruption and graft. Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed from an unnamed state after one of its Senators dies. He is appointed because the political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony, but who will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will make bigwig Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) millions. When the wide eyed Smith gets to Washington, he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a children's camp. When he tries to stop the project, Taylor's political machine frames him to make it seem like he is the one taking graft. This leads to the dramatic confrontation in the Senate, where Smith filibusters in an attempt to get the truth out.\n\nThis film is wonderful in so many ways. The story is a classic struggle between good and evil. In typical Capra style, the protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. If there is one clear message in Capra's films it is that those with strong moral fiber never give up hope. He likes to create utterly hopeless situations for characters to test their integrity, and rewards unswerving adherence to basic values and principles by triumph against the odds.\n\nI was dismayed to see a comment, obviously from a young viewer of this film, that said that the characters weren't realistic because no one used profanity. This is a sad testimonial to our culture, when it inconceivable to young people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not the rule.\n\nStewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of Washington, with its monuments and history. The story brings us a confrontation between political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the truly great men are the ones that don't compromise their principles to hold on to power. Stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the part.\n\nJean Arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by Washington politics, but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to Smith's noble homespun philosophies. Claude Rains is also masterful as the adulterated Senator, who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the presidency. He plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a torment that is clearly ripping his heart out, and the power of both emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant and pitiable.\n\nThis film is a national treasure. It is in my top 50 list of all time. The story of corruption in politics and the greatness of the men who resist it is timeless and would not be lost on the politicians in Washington today.",

            "content": "It's funny how the governor's kids actually have more grit than him, telling him he should appoint Mr Smith. Wow look at how young James Stewart is! Jefferson has an almost child-like innocence and humility that is very rare to see with people in his profession. The razing he received from the media press guys was kind of like his wake up call so that he could realize that the role he now takes on is no joke. That was so unique that whole shot where Jefferson is fumbling around with his hat dropping it when he talks to Paine's daughter. It shows how nervous he is around her. He's the kind of man that needs to be more common in politics. He's going to do great things, he just needs to now what he's going to do in office. \n\nIn a world full of crooked, cynical, underhanded and scheming politicians, Jefferson Smith is the ray of light that everyone can look to for hope. An honest man that's trying to do good in a world that's been overrun by greedy businessmen and leaders that are in it for their own self interest. I admire Smith's courage to stand up for himself when he knows something is out of line, he's no pushover. It's so insane to think how easy it is for someone of power to slander or smear the image of someone who is getting in the way of their own self interest. It was sad to see how torn up he was when all those letters came in telling him to stand down and give up, even though those letters were fabricated lies. \n\nFrank Capra has this way of making you cry whether if it's out of joy or a sentiment towards a character or moment; his movies can be very sentimental at times. I thought it was a very inspiring movie with a great message; don't be afraid to stand up to the machine and crooked greedy big business. Stand up for what's right, stand up for justice and most of all stand up towards the bullies of the world that are only out for their own self interest and don't care nothing about the people.",

Capra makes the story of one man standing up for what is right into a significant representation of all people in America. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a distinctly patriotic film as it depicts the importance of holding fast to American ideals of a democracy for the people.\n\nJames Stewart is brilliant as the naive youth nominated senator only to fall prey to corporate interests and political undermining. His outstanding speeches during the filibuster sequence is incredible to this day. I think that some of Stewart's finest acting comes when he endears himself to the lovely Jean Arthur in his office as he spouts American history and exceptionalism with a fervent patriotism. He is so real and looks like he really believed every word.\n\nClaude Rains is so interesting as a senator bought by a special interest, who must convince Stewart's senator to allow a dam to be built in a national park area. His scheming and deception is brilliantly executed, but it's Rains' own humanity and conflicts that make you so stunned by his subtle performance full of pained feelings.\n\nI love the firebrand performance from Jean Arthur as she rambles and rants her way into your heart. The way she denounces all the corruption, bribery, and dishonesty in the political game is fascinating and likable. Her spirited performance rivals the passion shown by James Stewart.\n\nIn all, Capra directed pure cinematic gold with Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. It's a funny comedy, biting satire, courageous plot, and riveting acting masterclass. Check it out for some real American political commentary.",

The film didn√¢(TM)t necessarily make me feel anything. In watching it, I didn√¢(TM)t feel any draw to the characters or the storyline. It did, however, make me think how it would be to have someone come into office without any experience doing so √¢\" which is something that we have experienced in our own politics. The film certainly differs from films of that era in that it isn√¢(TM)t a noir, romance, or thriller. It is very unique being so politically focused. I wish that they would have made the story more compelling to watch. As it stands, for me there wasn√¢(TM)t anything that made me intrigued to see how the story unfolds. In this professional work, I did enjoy aspects of the writing. I particularly liked the montage where Mr. Smith goes around to people that are reading the negative article about him and he punches them in the face. It√¢(TM)s such an interesting set-up for the character and gives him depth and stakes. I also enjoyed the comical √¢punch√¢? sound effect that was present in films of that era. In terms of directing, one of my favorite shots was when Saunders is talking to her boss and is standing over his desk telling him her idea of preventing Mr. Smith from doing his job. This exemplifies their power struggle √¢\" choosing to show her standing over him. Something that I really appreciated about the editing was the transitions they used. There were often dissolves and screen wipes when moving into the next scene or to show the passing of time. An example of this is when the senator has his first meeting, the screen wipe shows a transition through the passing of time throughout the meeting. As Jefferson Smith, James Stewart proved to have enjoyable moments to watch √¢\" particularly when Senator Smith first sits at his desk. In this moment, he is unsure as to how he should sit and very obviously readjusts his arms on his desk and was very comical in doing so. Regarding the cinematography, one shot that I found to be interesting was when Mr. Smith meets Susan Payne √¢\" the shot stays on Mr. Smith fumbling with his hat and then immediately goes into him knocking over a lamp. This choice to focus on his fumbling shows his nervousness of being around Susan. Mr. Smith is cool as a cucumber, but his direction shifts when Susan walks in. I really enjoyed the sound design in the film √¢\" particularly in the scene where Mr. Smith proposes his first bill. You could hear people laughing throughout and laughter would come from different parts of the room. It faded in and out really well and felt organic to the situation. The production value was certainly of great quality for the time. Sound design in those days wasn√¢(TM)t usually of great quality, but this film had great sound design.",

The reaction that M.SGtW garnered when it first was released betrays how times have changed and what makes that student's question so fascinating to me: In 1939, the idea that US Senators were so abysmally, irredeemably corrupt was so shocking as to draw condemnation across the country, with real senators walking out and production companies refusing funding. Not that anyone really disagreed, of course, but merely breaking protocols of civility seemed an anti-American threat to our institutions and standing in the world. There is no better time to criticize politicians then when criticizing politicians√¢\"the very heart of the democratic spirit upon which this country was founded√¢\"is called unpatriotic by those in power.\n\nHow especially telling, then, to compare this film, which has since its release enjoyed a century of parodies and nods and more image savvy politicians claiming as their own rallying cry, with another movie with a similar history: HIGH NOON, at first decried as unpatriotic, then celebrated as an archetype of American politics.",

The pairing of James Stewart and Jean Arthur worked perfectly. I was greatly inspired by this movie, it is indeed worth fighting for lost causes.",

It's vaguely reassuring to be reminded that these complaints aren't new. The story does pretty much exactly what you'd expect with its fish out of water good-natured country boy in the heart of Washington premise. He's a refreshingly innocent face dealing with a lot of serious issues, and the film does take the minutiae of getting a law passed in Congress seriously. The film does have some problems. A lot of the villainy is just too blunt and obvious. I'd like to imagine that it takes more than a minimal effort to frame a senator for corruption and I'd certainly have a hard time believing that they could go around beating up children and driving cars full of little boys off the road without anybody caring. And having to run an entire campaign in 24 hours is rather ridiculous. And if the cynicism that takes control of the film by the halfway point is unbelievable the way that he overcomes it with innate goodness is even less so. But what really sells the film is the optimistic nature of the piece and the winning performance by Jimmy Stewart (always one of my favorite performers). Whenever the film's problems threaten to overwhelm it, his performance brings it back on course. An underrated element of the film is his secretary, who's a surprisingly strong female role for 1939, played to the hilt with guts, brains, and passion. Well worth watching, but just watch out for the camp factor whenever it tries to get into issues of corruption and power.",

            "content": "Few films succeed in being relevant a decade or two after its release, but Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is still relevant 77 years later, especially in a voting year with questionable candidates.\n\nBefore Frank Capra ventured into his war propaganda films in the early-to-mid 40's, he made some of the most important and acclaimed films of all time.  In back to back years he directed the 1938 sleeper hit, You Can't Take it With You, and the classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.  Capra carried some of the same cast members over to the ladder, as Jimmy Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Edward Arnold are among the many who acted in both films.  Continuing with the tradition of Capra's other works, Mr. Smith deals with a common man taking on big ideas and ideals, only to be shut down by those more powerful and privileged.\n\nThis was the film that really showed the world what Stewart could do.  Even though I have seen tons of his films, this one stands out as some of his finest acting and most demanding roles of his filmography.  He was always great at playing an everyman and someone you can undeniably root for, and Jeff Smith is a defining role for him.  Smith represents the audience in going along for this political ride and I loved the way Stewart gave the character a certain amount of innocence and vulnerability while also displaying a graceful and powerful presence as well.\n\nHaving wonderful chemistry in You Can't Take it With You, it's no surprise that Stewart and Arthur's work together here is just as good, if not better.  Arthur plays Clarissa Saunders, who manages to keep Smith afloat even though he's constantly swept away by Washington and all of the extra perks for being in the Senate.  It's also not a forced romance, like a lot of 30's films, it takes a while for it to be developed as its handled with care.  Arthur may very well be the best romantic partner Stewart ever had.\n\n1939 was a fantastic year for film, with Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind also being released.  But perhaps no film from that year is still as relevant as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.  Capra covers the film with patriotism with beautiful shots of Washington D.C. and a patriotic song here or there, but its his step into a pessimistic style of filmmaking that's most intriguing here.  The last 30 minutes with Stewart giving an Oscar worthy performance and Capra seamlessly twisting the story into unpredictable territories is truly something special.\n\n+Stewart becoming the Stewart we all love\n\n+Arthur is marvelous\n\n+Capra's balanced directing\n\n10/10",

But this is a must see film for fans and critics solely because the opportunity to see a whole new side to Stewart is available. Note that the story is interesting to a point. It's campy, silly, and at times cliched with a sense of patriotism that really does not exist in America, and those are its flaws. The strengths of this film is that Capra isn't afraid to go there with his philosophy on morals and ethics. The film is about a man an innocent and naive man in a situation where is tempted to become as corrupt as our government is. That is Capra's message, and I find that interesting since it is in a film that cleverly disguises it.",

The performances, the betrayal are all fantastic and after the first half, what happens outside the senate hall is interesting and often tense, the confusion among the public, the riots both in protest and in support of Mr Smith and also the scenes where even the children are being threatened. But all that happens inside the senate after the first half are boring and you expect Mr Smith to throw in evidence about his innocence and the other group's crimes, instead he recites the Constitution of America and all Non-American viewers are bound to feel just the same way as the other senators who are often seen as tired and sleeping. The film is illogical and simply wants you to believe that pouring in patriotism can in turn save one and even turn to enemies into being dutiful. The film is extremely predictable at instances as well, like the hero loosing all hope after being betrayed, now you know there's got to be some motivating dialogues, then at least in here, for a change the lead actress gives the motivation. Then again, the way it handles the character of Senator Paine shows you how it's going to end after all. Capra has succeeded in making the audience almost comfortable through the entire film despite of all these and the film's use of children are also refreshing but illogical.

He wants to build a youth camp.  Unfortunately, his campground site is on a place earmarked for a dam, placing him in direct opposition to the party bosses and his co-senator, Joseph Paine (Claude Rains).\n\nHis love of country, and his love for his office secretary Ms. Saunders (Jean Arthur), give him the courage to persevere.\n\nWhat is interesting, from a political philosophical perspective, is how this film can be viewed as a leftist or far-rightist film, depending on your perspective.  Smith's crusade to speak truth to power is symbolic of the people's revolution in the purest sense.  And, yet, one cannot deny the fascistic overtones of one man's quest to channel the founding fathers' vision to take the youth into the wilderness and away from the corrupt city life, against the journalists and statesmen of education and prudence.\n\nIt gets four starts only because the ending, to me, is too much of a deus ex machina to be believed.

Naturally there's nothing like seeing the inner workings of a committee, particularly the biggest committee in the land, to crush someone's innocence. As a result this transitions into a story about one man with honesty and idealism fighting against the corruption of the American government. Jimmy Stewart is so brilliant as the naive Mr. Smith. He is exactly the kind of actor you want when you are trying to portray a man who has an almost child-like outlook on life, but also holds within him the strength of character to stand up against all opposition even when he appears to be all alone. Claude Rains is absolute perfection as the compromised Senator Paine. He puts so much depth into his performance that you can sense his resolve, his pride, and his guilt all in one conversation. At every moment you start to think he will break, and so the conclusion makes total sense and feels like a logical progression for his character. Jean Arthur has a nice arc to her story as well, and she is just the right kind of woman to guide Mr. Smith through the dark truths of the American political system.\n\nI am simply amazed how relevant this film is more than 75 years after it was made. The vision of big business controlling the government through money and influence is even more real today than it was in the 1930s. Just as Frank Capra made people dream back then of a small town man who would stand up for what is right, I think we all find ourselves now wishing that would be true in our day and age. Speaking of Capra's direction he really has an amazing eye for film-making. The way he frames shots is pure brilliance, and he knows exactly how to imbue all the emotion and heart into a scene. I was absolutely flabbergasted by the brilliance of the scene where Jefferson Smith meets Susan Paine. The way he holds the shot on their hands and tells the entire story through Smith fidgeting with his hat is masterful. He knows how to maximize a shot and get every little bit of subtext without having to overwhelm us with expository dialogue. My only complaint about Mr. Smith Goes to Washington would be the abrupt ending. It feels odd the way that everything just stops and we see literally none of the fallout after the big climax (SPOILERS: Our hero is even left unconscious as The End hits the screen.) However I have to hand it to Capra, because he has a magical way of getting the audience to an emotional high point and then just letting them walk away with this huge smile on their faces. This is a superb film, and one that I think should be required viewing for all film buffs.",

Great performances all around and I thoroughly enjoyed how this film tackled themes we still struggle with today-private interests influencing government, lack of journalistic integrity, no real freedom of the press, popular resignation and cynicism regarding the system, etc.  \n\nIn December 2014 it's very interesting to watch a film from 1940 about politics on Capital Hill only to realize how the influence of industry in government hasn't really changed.  That back then just as today those with great wealth are the ones who assert their will through the current practice of our political economy.  For me this film demonstrates how historically this sanctioned (and sometimes not so sanctioned) corruption has been the common practice in government for such a long time now.  And when something is common, it is often confused for what is normal.  When the thing that's common and seen as normal is not a healthy situation and many people know it, but worse accept it, then it leads to resignation and cynicism.\n\nIt's very easy for the cynical to view this film as somethings being an expression of cornball idealism under the weight of business as usual that has been the business for so long.  I prefer to see those ideals as something still worth fighting for, because they are human ideals of a functional society that were intended to be a code of honor for government.  They were supposed to be a values system for our views and behaviors toward one another in our communities so that government had something vital to protect and serve.  Those were the original intentions.  Cornball idealism?  To the easily accepting cynic-of course.  After all, how could we possibly end business as usual and truly move toward practicing those ideals?  A question that the resigned very easily have an answer for-we can't.",

A friend of his deceased father believes in him being a straight and narrow fellow that can be appointed to the senate and used as a puppet.  Once Jefferson arrives in the office and news breaks he will add little to the government, he sets out to make a difference.  He quickly finds himself in hot water when he discovers the misdeeds of members in the senate and they quickly move to get him booted from his position.  Mr. Smith will not go down without a fight.\n\n\"You're not a senator, you're an honorary stooge!\"\n\nFrank Capra, director of It's a Wonderful Life, It Happened One Night, Arsenic and Old Lace, Riding High, State of the Union, Meet John Doe, and American Madness, delivers Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.  The storyline for this picture is very clever and well delivered.  The concept is interesting and the acting is outstanding.  The cast includes James Stewart, Claude Rains, Jean Arthur, Edward Arnold, Thomas Mitchell, and Harry Carey.\n\n\"Chase an ambulance!\"\n\nI found this on Netflix and had to watch it.  This is one of my favorite Stewart performances.  He played this role so crisp and professionally and displayed Smith's slow breakdown throughout the movie perfectly.  This is a very well told story and definitely a classic (and displayed where they stole the Distinguished Gentleman concept).  I surely recommend seeing this movie.\n\n\"Stop having kittens.\"\n\nGrade: A",

Although it can be argued that the film is ultimately rooted in naivety, the hopeful call for the cyclical occurrence of generational improvement and an upheaval of crookedness is not only terrifyingly relevant in today's current political climate, it's incredibly affecting. After all, what 's more American than the quest for progress in the face of systemic, cynical stagnation and oppressive turpitude of a money-hungry establishment?

Worse still, much of the conflict of the movie revolves around Mr. Smith's desire to open a park to send young boys to, to \"teach them how to be men,\" which, dated values aside, is a classic pet project which makes every single piece of criticism hurled at Mr. Smith completely valid, despite his noble and altruistic intentions. But the last act, the only part of the movie anybody is likely to remember, still holds up. Jefferson Smith's filibuster against a system trying to destroy him is the stuff of film legend, with James Stewart's heartfelt and earnest portrayal only adding to the timeless messages contained therein.

For those who enjoy freedom of press, I hope they can appreciate that from the bottom of their heart and try their best to defend it if it is at risks; to those authoritarians who are against people's will, they should tremble for they are going to pay the cost. James Stewart's innocent, lighthearted, determined and righteous performance as Jefferson Smith undoubtedly sealed him the American hero in defending the people's rights and liberties. A commonly noted flaw is the forcible ending, but at least it is in line with Frank Capra's utmost optimism. In the contemporary world which is all about grey areas rather than Capra's absolute black and white, its dramatization and exaggeration serve as a bitter warning to those who take liberties easily.

Smith gets to Washington and has his ideals almost crushed by the atmosphere of DC, but takes on the Senate and the political machine of a man named Taylor (and unelected official who pretty much runs the show due to his money and connections) from his state.  Capra is one of those classic directors I really admire, and Stewart is great as his character goes from being nervous and feeling out of place to fighting passionately for his lost cause.

It had a wonderful director in Frank Capra and a wonderful supporting cast including Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, and Thomas Mitchell who make the story all the more relatable . In one of his best performances, Jimmy Stewart is an idealistic, naive boy's troop leader named Jefferson Smith. Believing he will be a pawn, a powerful man gets Smith a seat in the nation's Senate. However although he is out of place the patriotic Smith does his best to be worthy of his position. His actions soon find him face to face with the political machine that elected him. With all odds and seemingly everyone against him, Smith makes one last monumental effort. With the help of his secretary (Jean Arthur), Smith fights to plead his case through a filibuster. Fatigued by so many hours of talking, Smith finally collapses but not before effectively succeeding at his task. This movie is probably one of the most cheering ever and maybe Frank Capra's best.",

It's cliched with how heartwarming and feel good, and unsurprising it all is, but nevertheless is a very great film.\n\nJimmy Stewart cemented his status as a legend his, and this is one of his best and archetypical roles. He really brings the feverish determination of his everyman hero to life and delivers a great guy you can't help but root for. Supporting him are notable names like Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, and Edward Arnold, among others, all of whom deliver some strong performances.\n\nThe writing is sharp, the direction strong, and the cinematography and editing are pretty top notch, especially for the time. And of course, the message is quite timeless and still relevant.\n\nAll in all, this is one of the greats.

And stir up controversy it did.\n\nThis movie didn't hit me as hard as I expected it would. Its heart was in the right place, James Stewart's \"aw, shucks\" demeanor is a stark contrast to the corrupt senate and has you rooting for him the whole way, the acting is stellar from him and Claude Raines, and all in all this movie is extraordinarily well put together. However I feel this movie is a little too energetic and heavy handed in its story telling. What I mean is it's too quick paced and I had the feeling Capra was spoon feeding me the movie's metaphors and left me nothing to think about after the credits abruptly appeared.\n\nI didn't buy into this movie the same as everyone else, but that doesn't mean I don't recognize its quality and historical significance.

Similar to Wilder, Capra was a man that audaciously dethroned humanities idealized values, and boy, does he succeed with \"Mr. Smith goes to Washington.\" Capra portrays a world with the continuous, prominent battle: the common man vs the big man (not physically but rather politically or economically). Capra obviously wanted to challenge Americas strong-hold of pride: Independence. Through a battle of liberty and democracy against the likes of cynicism and oppression, Capra's film hits with contemporary resonance like a sledgehammer. And the while the notions of liberty and oppression may seem tiresome (even for a person who doesn't watch movies), it's Jimmy Stewart's performance and his portrayal of simplicity characteristics found within the 'common man' that greatly elevates \"Mr. Smith goes to Washington\" to a great and profounding effect.",

Unfortunately a film that so strikingly points of the problems of the political system would never be made today, and the little guy just can't make it anymore in the big world of politics. But that doesn't matter Mr Smith goes to washington MAKES YOU BELIEVE its possible to thwart corruption with good old fashion perseverance and heart.",

            "content": "Mr Smith goes to Washington is a movie that teaches you the power of being resilient.\n\nFrank Capra and James Stewart who also worked together in the 1946 movie Its A Wonderful Life, pulled out a perfect combination of acting and directing that will make you the viewer want to be like Mr. Smith.\n\nIn a world where politics is a dirty game of, \"if you can't beat them, join them.\" Mr Smith (James Stewart) was faced with the task of being the odd one out as he wanted to stand for what he believed in.\n\nFrank Capra and his crew had their work cut out for them to ensure authenticity; an elaborate set was created, consisting of the Senate committee rooms, cloak rooms. The thing that really stands out is the reproduction of the Senate Chamber on the Columbia lot.\n\nThe movie plot is about a Naive and idealistic gentleman Jefferson Smith (James Stewart). Smith is the leader of the Boy Rangers and due to a gap in the senate he was appointed by the governor of his state.\n\nIn the senate he met a friend of his father who he looked up to, Senator Joseph Paine. \n\nIn Washington, Smith discovers the many tricks and shortcomings of politics. His goal to build a national boys' camp leads to a conflict with the state political boss, Jim Taylor and his childhood hero Senator Joseph Paine. \n\nAfter the powers that be tried to requite Smith, he turned them down and by so doing Mr Taylor concocted a scandal that ruined Smith's name.\n\nThe whole movie is then based on how he tries to defend his name.\n\nThe movie did stand high on drama with few comic relief moments here and there, but the story is what makes you respect and love this classic. We are use to movies that depict the good guy wining at the end, but in this movie bit of reality are exposed, to triumph in any battle you must be ready to go the extra mile and do what has not been done before.\n\nIn 1977 Frank Capra Jr. remade the film with another name Billy Jack Goes to Washington starring Tom Laughlin. In 1992 Eddie Murphy starred in a movie loosely based on Mr. Smith goes to Washington called The Distinguished Gentleman. \n\nThe film also influenced many other films including Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde and Evan Almighty.\n\nThis classic is very readily available now a days and I ask you to go see it.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

            "content": "Another gem of a movie that aired on TCM last night that I have not seen for sometime. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington stars James Stewart as a naive Junior Senator in a world of corruption and career politicians. Overwhelmed by his surroundings and his new job he leans on an old friend of his fathers and his own childhood hero Senior Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains) for advice and direction. Mr. Smith finds that this country's government is not what he thought it was and neither is Senator Paine. If not for the friendship with his secretary, Miss Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), Mr. Smith's stay in Washington would have been very disenchanting. Through sheer will and determination Mr. Smith takes on the corruption of Washington and tries to fight for, what seems to be, a lost cause.\r\n\r\n    James Stewart's performance in this film was masterful and he was justly nominated for an Academy Award. He exuded innocence and sincerity with every word and every nervous stumble played out perfectly as he obviously dove into this character head first. There are several scenes throughout the movie that pull on your patriotic strings as you , the viewer, are reminded of what this nation is built on and for, as you connect with Mr. Smith's cause.\r\n     Not to go unrecognized are Jean Arthur and Claude Rains performances, in which they were also nominated for an Academy Award. Both of these actors were incredible and so well suited for their roles. Rains' performance in the final scene of this film was memorable, as the pressure of Mr. Smith's honesty and integrity start to wear on his conscience.\r\n\r\n    Directed by Frank Capra, who 7 years later directed Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life, this film moves along purposefully, as the viewer experiences the ups and downs of Mr. Smith's journey . There are many critics who believe this film to be his best, nominated for an Academy Award Capra lost out to Victor Fleming and Gone With the Wind.\r\n\r\n     Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a movie that pulls at all the right places and pushes at all the right times. The film is about innocence versus corruption, good versus evil, right versus wrong and having hope when facing adversity. Although made over 70 years ago the story is still relevent and maybe even more so today, than it was then.",

We see reporters getting the story to people, we see children working night and day (which i believe is going against that boy camp the young senator is fighting for!), but whatever the main big memorable scene here is the filibuster scene at the end, which Stewart does remarkable...but other than that I gotta say its a very slow movie and only check it out if your super interested in this kind of material. By no ways am I trashing Frank Capra..I find him a remarkable director this just wasn't my cup of tea.",

The movie's protagonist, Smith, comes off as way too innocent and benevolent that the film feels way too unrealistic. However, Stewart is commanding in the lead role and as things heat up towards the end, his passion for the role is unmistakable.",

            "content": "I almost feel silly writing a review about this classic film about Washington politics made during the Golden Age of Hollywood in 1939 because everyone has probably already seen it. The film was directed by the legendary Frank Capra who also directed many other classics such as It Happened One Night (1934), Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), You Can't Take It With You (1938), Meet John Doe (1941) and the film that is mandatory viewing on television at Christmas time, It's a Wonderful Life (1946).\r\n\r\nCapra was known for making pictures that dealt with the social issues of the times. They were also called \"feel good\" pictures because, while they took the audience through a tense human drama of despair and hopelessness throughout the film, they always made them feel happy by the end, something that was important to him because these pictures were made during The Great Depression and then during World War II. After his great many successes, movies and stories made by other directors that seemed to copy his style were referred to with a new word, \"Capra-esque!\"\r\n\r\nBut with politics so much in the news these days and with the possibility of one or two people out there who have never seen this film, I decided that it might be worthwhile to write about it. It is astounding that Jimmy Stewart, one of the greatest actors in all Hollywood history, seems to be displaying the art of method acting long before the style was even known. In a dramatic climactic scene near the end, with his youthful looks and dynamic intensity, I am convinced that no one else could have matched his performance.\r\nThe film is about Jefferson Smith (Jimmy Stewart) who is an idealistic young man and a leader in the Boy Scouts organization in his state. Because he is also very naive and unaware of the political game, he is newly appointed by the governor to take the place of the state senator who had just died. The objective of the governor is to get someone in the office who can be easily controlled by the senior senator (Claude Rains) and by the bosses of the state so that they can proceed with their agenda of crooked corruption in congress.\r\nWhen Mr. Smith gets to Washington, he is met by his assistant (Jean Arthur) who feels sorry for him and his inexperience and so she takes him under her wing to keep him out of trouble. But she soon sympathizes with his plan to introduce a bill to benefit The Boys Scouts of his state when it becomes apparent that his plan would throw a monkey wrench into the scheme of the bosses who have other motivations to make some fast money. She helps him to navigate the complex congressional rules to the point where he must initiate a filibuster where he is obligated to stand up alone and continue talking non-stop the whole session day after day so that he will not lose the floor. He thinks that by doing this, he will rally his constituents at home but he has underestimated his enemies.\r\n\r\nTHE BOTTOM LINE?\r\nThe film is magnificently cast with top notch actors including Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Thomas Mitchell and Harry Carey. It did not win the oscar because it was up against the massive epic, Gone With The Wind. It was most likely the first film to expose the political corruption that goes on in the nation's capital as it does wherever and whenever power and money are involved. The picture was filmed in black and white and is a classic uplifting movie with classic performances made 72 years ago but still very effective and remarkably relevant today as it was then.\r\n\r\nFrom the Aisle Seat at the Movies\r\nmoxieandcharisma.wordpress.com",

This film released in 1939 has young James Stewart at his very best. It is a political drama/ comedy with elements of patriotism and the usual good vs evil plot. The film has a crowd pleasing element only matched by few.\r\n\r\nJeff Smith (James Stewart) believes that children are the future and they should take the values from their great Country. When a senator dies in his state, the governor is forced into an awkward position of electing him the new senator. When Mr. Smith- the true patriot, arrives Washington, he is amazed by all the greatness that Washington possesses. He comes up with idea to propose a Bill that would let kids come together and enjoy the wilderness in a plot in his home town. His colleague Mr. Pain has his own plans with that same land. The film then releases the full fury of what corrupt politicians can do to a truthful man. The U.S. Senate is amazingly detailed. It's also a nice lesson in how the Senate works, how bills have to go through committees, the rules of behavior and filibustering. A heart warming patriotic film from a very rare and different angle.",

Excellent direction, awesome acting, and some of the best editing I have ever seen in a film. It deserves every single accolade it received, and more. The story is actually quite complex and interesting. It's about Jefferson Smith, played by James Stewart, who get's nominated for senator after the death of Senator Samuel Foley. Smith was nominated because of his work as the leader of the state's Boy Rangers group. Mr. Smith is a little nervous when he starts out, but he starts to get the hang of it, and tries to introduce some of his ideas, most of them are turned down, so he has to stand up for what he believes in, and by stand up, I really do mean \"STAND UP\". The story is very well done, even if it seems slightly far-fetched at times. Also, some of the scenes following the story are extremely well done, especially the ending. The characters are very likable and anything but cliches, especially Mr. Smith himself. They feel like real life people, while still being interesting. The acting is outstanding. Every actor, no matter how long they're on screen, leave a big impact. I was even shocked a young African-American boy was in the movie, as this was a time where racism was more widespread. Even still, Gone with the Wind had an African-American woman in a bigger role, so it's not a huge deal, even though it was still a great move by Capra to break the Black/White barrier. Also, James Stewart does completely TREMENDOUS in this film. In my personal opinion, Stewart is the second best actor ever (Behind Chaplin), and this has got to be one of his best roles. He's so intense when he needs to be, but when the movie is calm, so is Stewart. He's actually quite quirky at those parts, but in the climax, he is just powerful with every word. Also, Jean Arthur get's completely lost in her character, and between her and Stewart, it's hard to decide who's better. Now, as every recent review I do does this eventually, it's time for \"The Best and Worst of Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\". The best, undoubtedly, has to be the last half an hour or so. This is where Mr. Smith talks non-stop, I'm not gonna say what he's talking about, and as time goes by, he get's more and more exhausted, and while he's doing this, his friends try to rally for him, but all attempts fail. The scene is actually depressing, with Mr. Smith talking for hours with no one listening, and his friends failing to rally for him. I won't tell you what happens in the end, but it's a big surprise. The worst of this film... The only huge flaw I can think of is how they portray the government. I know, I know, the government sucked back then like it does now, but it seems to portray the government representatives as snooty, hate-filled, etc, which can get on your nerves at times. Even with that flaw, this is still an awesome, timeless, wonderfully edited, amazingly acted, and tremendously written film, well worthy of a watch for all ages. 5/5.",

And from then on I found it difficult to look away. I did not realize that Stewart was that old, I looked at the date and I was surprised that this was a 1939 film, in my opinion, this is his best performance.

However, a well-intentioned deed sets off a dramatic chain of events, a series of events that will see him at odds with his colleagues, with the shadowy, bullying powerbrokers and with the entire Senate.\n\nBrilliant movie from Frank Capra.  While Capra also gave us such great movies as It's A Wonderful Life, Meet John Doe and It Happened One Night, this is his greatest work.  A superb indictment of politics and how democracy has been undermined and corrupted, told with the trademark Capra brand of wholesomeness and practical idealism.  Considering how politics has even further degenerated since 1939, even more relevant today than when it was released in 1939.\n\nClever, engaging plot that doesn't waiver for a second.  Not an ounce of deadwood in the movie - every scene is perfect and important.  Some great twists and turns and some great tension towards the end as Smith struggles to preserve his name and ideals.  Wonderful themes and morals too, as you would expect from Frank Capra.\n\nAdd in some excellent performances, especially from James Stewart in the lead role and Jean Arthur as Ms Saunders.  Both received Oscar nominations, as did Harry Carey for playing the President of the Senate.\n\nIn all, Mr Smith Goes To Washington was nominated for 11 Oscars, including Best Picture, but won only one, for best original screenplay.

The idea of the little guy taking on a hopeless fight against a machine he can't possibly defeat and which is bent on breaking him but which he fights anyway because he must, his refusal to be broken, his indomitable spirit and unshakeable belief that one day, kindness, goodness and love of ones neighbour can triumph, the strength to be the lone voice in a crowd and to never give up no matter what, the idealistic determination to 'always see life as if you've just come out of a tunnel', it's just everything I love about a movie. Jimmy Stewart must be one of the best actors I've ever seen. Saunders was captivating and adorable (the note she sent to Jeff while he was on the floor was so good). And Frank Capra...It's A Wonderful Life is my favourite film of all time and he's produced another classic here. Worthy of all those Oscar nominations it apparently received.\n\n\"I do not yield!\"",

And this is a political film and there are points where I do lose some interest.  But the power of Mr. Smith is in how it ends.  In his apparent defeat, he in some ways wins.  After his collapse, it induces Payne to exonerate Jeff of the false charges that he fought tooth and nail to be cleared of.  In effort for understanding and defense, the good moral conscious of a Capra character induces them to come clean and clear the hero from his apparent defeat.  Apparent at first but in being exonerated, he wins and he's totally oblivious due to being unconscious at the time.  An underdog David and Goliath story done well.  A film for the ages.  P.S.:  Forgive me for being bored with the political speak.  Its just not my thing.  The allure of the film is in Jeff's idealism and his ignorance in the wheelings and dealings of the Washington elite that subsequently lead to the conflict.",

He has been hand-picked to be appointed senator of his state by a corrupt political boss named Jim Taylor, played impressively by Edward Arnold. The great Claude Rains delivers a magnificent Academy Award nominated turn, as the senior senator and Smith's troubled colleague, a good man gone bad by the power of politics. Smith later learns that a pending appropriations bill will fund a graft project, a dam backed by his powerful sponsor. To prevent the bill from passing before this plot can be revealed to the public, Smith takes to the Senate floor to stage a filibuster and speaks for hour after hour, a lone hero standing up for what's right on the floor of the United States Senate is one of the greatest showdowns in the history of the cinema. Masterful Academy Award nominated direction by Capra, with tremendous performances by Jean Arthur, Thomas Mitchell, Harry Carey, Eugene Pallette, Beulah Bondi, and Guy Kibbee. An intelligent and witty Academy Award winning screenplay by Sidney Buchman, with beautiful black & white cinematography by Joseph Walker, and striking art direction by Lionel Banks, that features a meticulous-crafted and perfect replica of the U.S. Senate chamber, which is an uncanny set. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director: Frank Capra. A timeless classic! Highly Recommended.",

            "content": "No one is better than Frank Capra to expose the heart and sincere essence of what it means to be an American in this  inspirational piece of storytelling.\r\n\r\nJimmy Stewart stars as Jefferson Smith, a Montana boy scout leader suddenly turned senator by Senator Paine (Claude Rains). At first, everyone makes fun of Smith and his traditional values, especially by his secretary (Jean Arthur) and his press corespondent (Thomas Mitchell). But once he finds himself in a scandal of alleged corruption, Smith must convince the Senate that he is innocent; by any means possible. \r\n\r\nFrank Capra's direction is spectacular. Like every great director you can automatically identify his style. Orson Welles is dramatic and visually dazzling, John Ford is sentimental and has vivid landscapes, Alfred Hitchcock is smug and suspenseful, and then you have Frank Capra, who provides a nimbly paced sympathetic story about moral values as well as great visuals when you need them. \r\n\r\nI would rank this with Capra's other achievements; It Happened One Night, You Can't Take It With You, and A Wonderful Life. If It Happened One Night is the rudimentary romantic comedy, and A Wonderful Life is the rudimentary inspirational story, then this is the rudimentary underdog story. \r\n\r\nThe story is flawless, and so is Capra's storytelling, but I will admit that there are some points that transcended my believability. Like the talking for 23 hours scene. And there were moments that were \"too good to be true\" or just seemed a little to unreal. Otherwise every scene is expertly crafted and there are many little details that make the film work better as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is deservingly monumental. Politicians and corruption? That sounds Absurd! Well here you go in 1939. And it's probably the most pro-American-film-that-criticizes-the-government ever made. Every scene, and I mean EVERY scene at the Senate House or with Claude Rains or with Harry Carey was perfect because it managed to keep its sense of seriousness and still have the old Hollywood magic.   \r\n\r\nThere's one scene near the beginning where Mr. Smith goes around punching journalists in the face, and that was just plain hilarious. There's also a great moment where Jimmy Stewart is nervous about talking to this girl who he has a crush on, and the camera just focuses on his hat which he's fidgeting with. Not something to be missed.\r\n\r\nNow, there's a lot of hullaballoo about the performances here. Jean Arthur is good. Claude Rains is phenomenal. Harry Carey is amiable. Thomas Mitchell (trivia: he won an Oscar for Best Sup. Actor the same year for Stagecoach) is witty and charming. Edward Arnold yet again fits into the \"evil corporate monster\" role. And now to Jimmy Stewart:\r\n\r\nJimmy Stewart is my favorite actor and is who I consider is the greatest American actor of all time. Naturally, the only reason I went out to get this film was because of his legendary performance. After watching this, I must reflect; other than his famous monologue at the end, Stewart isn't really given much to do. So during the end he's spectacular and completely grabs your heart. For the rest of the movie, when he's there, he's okay.\r\n\r\nThis film was nominated for 11 Oscars and won 1. \"Why is that?\" you may ask. 1939 was the same year that Gone With The Wind was made. You could say that the Oscars were already reserved. Gone With The Wind vs. Mr. Smith Goes To Washington is a worthy battle, but I consider Gone With The Wind to be the granddaddy of all Best Picture winners. It also deserved to win every award it did over Mr Smith Goes To Washington, which is Picture, Director, Screenplay, Art Direction, and Film Editing. Jimmy Stewart didn't win Best Actor, and that's not as much of a crime as it seems, because my second choice would have been Clark Gable for Gone With The Wind other than whoever that was that did win.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith Goes To Washington is predictably iconic and a timeless masterpiece that represents Frank Capra at his finest. 99/100",

However, he soon witnesses everything that is wrong with it as he played by the press and the government itself. \r\n\r\nHe is eventually accused of a crime he didn't commit just so the Senators can get a bill passed of their own that unfortunately conflicts with one of Smith's own bills. From here, Smith fights back. This is where the film has all of its beauty, people. The final 40 minutes are a full onslaught of Stewart in prime acting. I highly recommend this film to anyone and everyone. It has fantastic moral messages much like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and promotes a massive applause by the film's end. A must see and a perfect film for sure.",
