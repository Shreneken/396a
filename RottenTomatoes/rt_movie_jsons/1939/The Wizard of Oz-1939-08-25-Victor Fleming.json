            "content": "A vibrant musical that brings realizations to real-world struggles in an interesting way.\n\n      The wizard of oz is a Broadway musical written by E.Y., and the music was produced by Harold Arlen. It is about a girl (Dorothy) and her dog (Toto) getting taken away by a tornado to the magical land of OZ. When they get there, they see a yellow brick road so, they decide to follow it. While they were following the yellow brick road, they met 3 different characters. They met the scarecrow who was missing a brain, the tin man who doesn't have a heart, and finally, they met the Cowardly Lion who is trying to find courage. They keep going along to try and get to the emerald city when they run into a wizard, they ask for his help to get back home and he says that he wants them to bring him the wicked witch of the west's broom. But Dorothy accidentally killed the wicked witch of the west's sister (the wicked witch of the east), so she is out to get her. Dorothy meets the wicked witch of the north who gives her something to protect her. After that, the good witch tells them who might be able to help them get home (the wizard of OZ). \n        This musical was on Broadway in 1903 it was an amazing musical. There were unique props, characters, and scenery which made the musical interesting to watch. The musical is relevant because it portrays racism and struggles back home. Altogether I think this musical/movie was good it taught a lot of important messages in an interesting way. There are a lot of things that catch your eye because of all the colors I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.",

            "content": "Where to begin? MGM's elaborate adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 fantasy classic THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ not only became an institution among itself (and practically defined the concept of modern popular culture), but is reported to be the most viewed film ever made. A sharp screenplay effectively condenses the novel's text into a workable film, and director Victor Fleming (along with countless other behind-the-scenes technicians) craft a visually stimulating fantasy world that surpasses the expectations of even the most imaginative viewers. Brimming with stunning visual effects (the film's fierce tornado is an FX feat that has yet to be surpassed by CGI), witty dialogue, and eye-popping Technicolor, THE WIZARD OF OZ truly lives up to it's reputation as a once-in-a-lifetime film where every element comes together flawlessly.\n\nThe cast could not be improved upon. The quivery-voiced, solemn-faced Judy Garland will always be Dorothy, the little lost farm girl on the road to Oz, clutching her beloved Toto (impressively portrayed himself by the female canine performer Terry, the terrier). It seems inconceivable that MGM had originally wished to cast Shirley Temple in the role, as Temple's doe-eyed, cutesy-voiced shtick would have been a catastrophic ill-fit for the tone of this picture. Conversely, Garland is perhaps the screen's quintessential woman/child; always seemingly just one step away from reaching full emotional maturity. It is her sadness that transfixes viewers to the screen, the exact same quality that made the film's most memorable Harold Arlen/E. Y. Harburg number \"Over the Rainbow\" into one of the most exquisite marriages between artist and song ever to be recorded.\n\nThe remainder of the cast is similarly exceptional, many of whom perform perfectly even under the most debilitating make-up and costumes. Frank Morgan is marvelously versatile in no less than five roles, the insanely energetic Bert Lahr mugs brilliantly, the handsome Jack Haley swoons sweetly, Billie Burke lends the film an ornate ethereality, and Ray Bolger's gravity-defying physical presence nearly steals the entire picture on several occasions. Perhaps most notable is former schoolteacher Margaret Hamilton's transformation into the wickedest of wicked witches, which certainly remains among the vilest and most terrifying portrayals of full-throttle evil ever to be seen. No matter how it is analyzed, scrutinized, or satirized, the 1939 production of THE WIZARD OF OZ is a top-notch example of how to turn a great story into a fabulous, milestone of a film.\n\nGarland, who was only 16 when Oz was filmed, is inimitably sublime as Dorothy, especially when she sings.  Although contemporary moviegoers are used to the precocious young, \"triple threats,\" marketed by Disney and Nickelodeon, Garland stands out as one of the first.  Garland's impressively mature voice soars beyond the rainbow and into audiences' hearts.  Beyond Dorothy, there's the amazing trifecta of theater trained actors who played her yellow brick road companions.  Hamilton is delightfully evil as the green-skinned witch, and Burke is memorably comforting as the good witch Glinda.  Everyone should see the Wizard of Oz multiple times in their lives; it's simply a must see film.",

I would say the most important idea behind this film is Maya, and you can talk about it it many ways, but, Maya is the root of the show.\n\nThe things I can't stop thinking about as an adult when watching this film is how they tortured the actors in the making of this; Judy Garland was starved and had her chest bound, Jack Haley got poisoned from the silver paint, and Margaret Hamilton got set on fire and burned very badly. When Margaret Hamilton wouldn't do the scene again, they set her stunt double on fire and burned her badly, too. \n\nBeware of the dream makers, kids, and stick with books if you can.",

The Wicked Witch of the West is arguably the first great villain in Western cinema and all of the characters are pretty memorable. The Cowardly Lion, Dorothy, the Tin Man, and the Scarecrow have resonated with audiences for over 80 years and will probably last another 80 years. If there is one film I would show to people who think movies from the 1930s are dated, I'd show them this film.

This movie can be complete analyzed and framed in narcissism, and is often used to discuss it.

This Technicolor extravaganza contains such trippy imagery . Most of us first saw Wizard as children, but I, for one, appreciate it much more as an adult. I see flaws in most of the films I liked as a child but look back on as a grown up. Many of them can be enjoyed only for their nostalgia value. When I re-watch Wizard, I realize that as a kid I didn't have the full set of tools to enjoy it properly. The film has an enduring impression on me.\n\nAdapted from L. Frank Baum's timeless children's tale about a Kansas girl's journey over the rainbow, The Wizard of Oz opened at Grauman's Chinese Theater on August 15, 1939.\n\nDirector: George Cukor and King Vidor and Mervyn LeRoy and Norman Taurog and Victor Fleming\n\nStarring: Bert Lahr, Billie Burke, Frank Morgan, Jack Haley, Judy Garland, Ray Bolger\n\nAdapted from L. Frank Baum's timeless children's tale about a Kansas girl's journey over the rainbow, The Wizard of Oz opened at Grauman's Chinese Theater on August 15, 1939.\n\n\"Over the Rainbow\" was nearly cut from the film; MGM felt that it made the Kansas sequence too long, as well as being too far over the heads of the children for whom it was intended.\n\nThe song \"Over the Rainbow\" was ranked #1 by the American Film Institute in 2004 on the 100 Greatest Songs in American Films list.\n\nIncluded among the American Film Institute's 1998 list of the Top 100 Greatest American Movies.\n\nThe horses in Emerald City palace were colored with Jell-O crystals. The relevant scenes had to be shot quickly, before the horses started to lick it off.\n\nThe \"tornado\" was a 35-foot-long muslin stocking, spun around among miniatures of a Kansas farm and fields in a dusty atmosphere.\n\nDorothy's iconic red slippers now live at the Smithsonian Institution, and are so popular that the carpet in front of the attraction has had to be replaced numerous times due to wear and tear.\n\nA recent study claimed that this is the most watched movie in film history, largely due to the number of television screenings each year as well as the various video/DVD/Blu-ray/4K releases, which have enabled children of every and all generations to see it.\n\nJudy Garland found it difficult to be afraid of Margaret Hamilton, because she was such a nice lady off-camera.\n\nIt took upwards of 12 takes to have Toto run alongside the actors as they skipped down the yellow brick road.\n\nTerry (Toto) was stepped on by one of the witch's guards, and had a double for two weeks. A second double was obtained, because it resembled Toto more closely. Judy Garland very much wanted to adopt Terry after the two spent so much time together shooting the film. Unfortunately, the owner of the dog wouldn't give her up, and Terry went on to a long career in films. She died in 1945 and was buried in her trainer's yard.\n\nThe Munchkins troupe came from Europe, many of them were Jewish and a number of them took advantage of the trip to stay in the US in order to escape the Nazis. Professional singers dubbed most of their voices, as many of them couldn't speak English and or sing well.\n\nThe Munchkins were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in November, 2007.\n\nThe movie's line \"I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!\" was voted as the #99 movie quote by the American Film Institute (out of 100). \"Toto, I've got a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore\" was #4. \"There's no place like home.\" was #23.\n\nBesides \"The Jitterbug\" being completely cut, other songs were trimmed. \"Lions and tigers and bears (oh my!)\" was a song rather than just a chant. The lion's \"If I Only Had the Nerve\" was longer, and the Scarecrow had a long dance sequence in \"If I Only Had a Brain.\"\n\nThe Cowardly Lion's facial makeup included a brown paper bag. Bert Lahr couldn't eat without ruining his makeup. Tired of eating soup and milkshakes, he decided to eat lunch and have his makeup redone daily :)\n\nMany of The Wicked Witch of the West's scenes were either trimmed or deleted entirely, as Margaret Hamilton's performance was thought to be too frightening for audiences.",

            "content": "I have never been a Judy Garland person as I just can't see her appeal when she was an average performer at best and apparently very difficult to work with. This film features one of her two most iconic performances as she cemented her status as a gay icon here and appeared in some of the most enduring images in cinema history. For how influential it has been and how acclaimed it is I have to say that I was underwhelmed as although it has it's iconic moments the filler in between is largely dull and unmemorable. I found myself tuning out even though the film was a slight one hour and forty one minutes.\n\nIn small town Kansas young Dorothy Gale, Judy Garland, is lonely as her attempts to discuss the mistreatment she has faced at the hands of the villainous Almira Gulch, Margaret Hamilton, are rejected by her family members. Her only friend is her dog Toto but he is at the center of her conflict with Gulch who arrives at her house threatening to sue her family if they do not give up the dog. Her Auntie Emily, Clara Bandick, complies with this order but Toto escapes from Gulch's bag and returns to Dorothy who goes with him to a fortune teller before facing the threat of a hurricane when she returns home. She falls asleep and dreams that she arrives in Munchkinland in the Land of Oz where her house falls on and kills the Wicked Witch of the East. This causes her sister the Wicked Witch of the West to threaten Gale and she must team up with a rag tag bunch of other failures to save Munchkinland and return home to Kansas which appears like a more appealing prospect now that she is lost in a foreign land.\n\nFirst I must note that there are absolutely wonderful moments in the film that help me to understand why this film is so beloved. The first is the unforgettable performance of \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" which made me believe that the film was going to be the exploration of loneliness and wistful heartache that I wanted. The lyrics of the song can relate to almost anybody as youths feel the sadness and isolation of this young girl and older people will be able to look back on a time in their lives when they felt alone and yearned for a bright future. The fact that it was placed so early in the film hurt the film in a way because it was easily the best moment in the film and promised a better film than what was to come. There are also the images that people associate with this film as the ruby slippers are memorable.\n\nThe disappointment I am referring to is the mid-section of the film as when the plot really kicks in and Gale meets her various acquaintances I found myself bored. Suddenly it felt like a generic episode of children's television as she learns lessons along the way and discovers the value of friendship in a very Norman Lear fashion. The jokes didn't land and when Garland was not singing she struggled to imbue Gale with a sense of naturalism and honesty required of a character so childlike and na\u00efve. The whole performance felt forced and contrived when she was asked to deliver dialogue and carry scenes of emotional weight. Her group of friends also did not charm me as they should have with all of their little problems and preoccupations irking me. Director Victor Fleming would have done better to make the film more serious and try to adopt the melancholic tone of the early scenes throughout. With all of the color and the flash present in the middle of the film you would think that it is at least captivating but strangely I was turning away constantly and trying my hardest to concentrate on the action on screen but failing.\n\nPerhaps if I had seen the film on television as a child, as many who count the film among their personal favorites had, I would like it more but seeing it for the first time at sixteen with high expectations I was left unmoved.",

The cinematography in this film is so amazing, at the beginning in Kansas is in black and white but when Dorothy ends up in Oz it is in colour. Also the     small details like the woman on the bicycle who may become the wicked witch of the west. In Oz all of the colours look amazing and the Emerald City in the background  is so well done. The wicked witch of the west and her army of flying monkeys are very scary especially for the time. Taking into account this was made in 1939 the effects, camera movements and that most of the film is in colour makes it seem like it was made about 10-20 years later than when it was actually made. One of the best films is the characters from Dorothy to the lion and everything they want to get including  a brain, a heart, bravery and a way home all of the characters are so likeable| the lion, the tin man, the scarecrow and Dorothy. In conclusion this a film that is so amazing from the characters to the cinematography it is so amazing and I would recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "The Wizard of Oz is a very good movie for its amazing special effects and beautiful audio. It also has strong relations to historical events including the New deal. Before the era of monster movies with over-the-top and stunning visuals, The Wizard of Oz demonstrated some very excellent examples of special effects. The tornado that picked up Dorathy and Toto and transported them to the Land of Oz is a perfect example on how the FX in this movie still stands the test of time. A. Arnold Gillespie was the special effects supervisor and he used some sophisticated techniques to create the tornado, with a mixture of miniatures and very big sets to create probably the most known element of the entire movie. The special effects made by Gillespie is outstanding and it stands out compared to even some CGI of today. Another artistic element of The Wizard of Oz was its uncomparable music and audio. Throughout the film the music has always been the standout part. Since it is a musical it has many aspects of well made music including probably the most famous song Over the Rainbow. Every song in The Wizard of Oz is a catchy classic that you can't help but sing along to, that's why there has been multiple covers and different renditions for a lot of the songs. Even Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was clearly inspired by the movie. The Wizard of Oz also has many historical relations and symbolism all over the movie. After a grand tornado, Alice and some of her new friends unite to fight the dreaded Wicked Witch of the West and get to the wizard of Oz to help all of them. A lot of symbolism could be made with the tornado being the Great Depression, Alice and her companions being different people unify to defeat the bad times that they couldn't do if they didn't have each other and seek help from the Wizard of Oz who can be resembled as Franklin D Roosevelt. The way that he would help them is by using the New Deal. The Wizard of Oz is a very excellent movie for its wonderful special effects, audio, and its relations/symbolism to FDR's New Deal.",

            "content": "A dreamy innocent fantasy parable for families!\n\nVictor Fleming's fantasy musical The Wizard of Oz (1939) is a shining example of creative direction and innovative special effects culminating in a magical movie of constant delights! Fleming makes great use of all manner of movie tricks to ensure that The Wizard of Oz remains a pleasant family film forevermore. You can see The Wizard of Oz' influence in anything from Jim Henson's Labyrinth to Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings. It's an ambitious fantasy film, while maintaining its status as a fun family musical.\n\nWith lavish foliage filled sets, striking sepia tones for the opening and closing sequences, vibrant technicolor throughout all of Oz, sublime background paintings, ornate sets, spliced together footage during the thrilling tornado sequence, Blanche Sewell's smooth editing, real birds on set, and neat visual effects, The Wizard of Oz fuses all manner of movie magic resulting in the viewer being transported to Oz like Dorothy. The Wicked Witch's smokescreen sequence on her broom is as cool as any great film's imagery. You will smile with the arrival of the good witch's bubble and your children will fear the flying monkeys for sure. Fleming's direction is sleek and powerful as he captivates you with fascinating and creative filmmaking.\n\nHarold Rosson's cinematography finds plenty of wide shots to create a vast space for the audience to imagine Oz as a real place. The stunning close-up shots are as iconic as any movie's. The steady panning zooms are intriguing and keep you on your toes. Harold Arlen's score is bright and cheery allowing the audience to get wrapped up in Oz' movie magic. The Wicked Witch's dark theme is instantly recognizable and my favorite part to hear chime in as the announcement of her arrival. Jack and Lyle Dawn's make-up is still realistic and believable for The Scarecrow and The Tin Man. The Cowardly Lion's suit and face make-up is very fun indeed.\n\nEdgar Allan Woolf, L. Frank Baum, Noel Langley, and Florence Ryerson wrote The Wizard with a shocking tongue in cheek attitude, while also capturing the movie's innocent and naive wanderlust. You get a warm and fuzzy feeling with all the playful dialogue of puns, references, and morals. Many of the lines from The Wizard of Oz are unforgettable and invaluable advice. The themes of wisdom, heart, courage, and kindness inspired bravery and decency in generations of children. This movie is just excellent teaching with friendly faces.\n\nSpeaking of whom, Judy Garland is simply marvelous as the lead actress in The Wizard of Oz named Dorothy Gale. Her resplendent innocent voice rings true as a young lady desperate for what is on the other side of life only to learn that she loves her home. Garland is charming, playful, sweet, forlorn, and frightened as Dorothey as she encounters a plethora of strange phenomena in The Land of Oz. Garland is mostly remembered for her radiant singing in the heart-wrenching \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow.\" A sorrowful ballad longing for the greener grass on the other side of life, \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" remains one of cinema's greatest musical compositions. Judy Garland was a special actress and remarkable talent. I appreciate her lovely portrayal of Dorothy more with each viewing of The Wizard of Oz.\n\nI just adore Dorothy's dog Toto played by Terry. He is so cute and fluffy, while a nice distraction from the main story as he wags his way through Dorothy's dream sequence. Did I mention that The Wizard of Oz is one giant dream sequence as Dorothy gets knocked out by the twister? Anyways, The Wizard of Oz prominently features an adorable little dog named Toto, who is a wonderful addition to the film. Toto is practically the main character at some points.\n\nRay Bolger is steadfast and silly as The Scarecrow. His erratic movements and loyal nature makes him a friendly first encounter for Dorothy. Bolger feels like a Danny Kaye or Bing Crosby character. Jack Haley gives an almost Tony Curtis type performance as The Tin Man. His emotional depiction is thoughtful and his face is so expressive. His janky movements, metallic in style, are super entertaining to watch as well. Likewise, Bert Lahr is hilarious as The Cowardly Lion with his near Dom DeLuise level acting.\n\nNotably, Margaret Hamilton delivers the most important, archetypal acting that inspires witch portrayals to this day as The Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz. Her iconic cackling, dramatic movements, devilish glee, and bad intentions are delirious fun to witness during The Wizard of Oz. Her all black outfit and pointy hat are as striking and legendary as her broom. The green skin and pointy nose is just a bonus upon Hamilton's fantastic performance here.\n\nI really enjoy Frank Morgan as the shyster magician Professor Marvel and his deceitful warlock The Wizard of Oz. He endears you to him by the end with a splendid warm honesty that allows Morgan to portray a reformed liar into an earnest ally. Frank Morgan sells the overall themes of the film very convincingly. Lastly, Billie Burke is saccharine and sincere as Glinda the Good Witch of the North.\n\nIn all, The Wizard of Oz is a perfect family night for all ages. It's got magic, friendship, and music for everyone!",

I won't bother to summarize the plot, because everyone already knows the story. Rewatching it now, it's fun to see how this film has influenced everything from the 1980s version of \"Flash Gordon,\" to Jim Henson's \"Labyrinth,\" to obscure sci-fi comedies like \"Heartbeeps,\" to even J.R.R. Tolkien's \"Lord of the Rings.\" The film is admittedly slow at times, some songs are better than others (\"If I Only Had a Brain\" and \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" are the high points), and it's incredibly corny though out, but there is an undeniable charm and magic to the proceedings. Although many newer films have better special effects, less mannered of acting, and far better production design, they don't hold a candle to the wonder and magic of this true American film classic.

            "content": "The Wizard of Oz: transcendental systems and how to become great outside of them\n\n\nDorothy is innocence.  The great thing about innocence is that it is always being reborn.  Innocence is everywhere right now.  Being born everyday.  The innocence or good heartedness and beauty of the Munchkins who represent a harmonious order.\n\nDorothy and her trio learn by the end of the film that they do not lack anything.  That they have everything they need.  To become smart everyday (as symbolized by the gift of a diploma).  To become human everyday (by the gift of a heart shaped watch).  To become brave everyday (by the gift of a medal).  \n\nThe wicked witch presents a threat to ascending the transcendental order, but she is very much a part of it.  There can be no god without a devil.  And the Wizard of Oz, a false god but a god at the top of the order nonetheless, sends them right to the wicked witch to fetch her broom (what the Wizard thinks is impossible for the wicked witch will take destroy them).  The wicked witch is merely another slave master and so is the wizard once he is revealed.  They perform the negative reactionary patterns necessary to keep their transcendental order operating.\n\nDorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man, and the Lion progress from scared reactionaries convinced by conditioning in a transcendental order of what they lack.  This lack keeps them in service to whoever they think can fulfill them as people.  They progress to empowered rhizomatic forces of acceptance and positivity.  Grateful to be alive.  Alive in the now.  Living to explore.  To play.  To dance and sing.  To sing songs of joy rather than of complaint.  \n\nThe emerald city is an illusion at the other end of the poppy fields.  The price of such an order is usually sleep.  The thoughtless worker.  The zombie.  \n\nGlinda the Good Witch is the positive creative force of life.  Mother nature and her spirits.  She embraces the cosmic unity.  She wakes them with snow, nature's element of which they are a part.  She wakes them through their connectedness to nature in order to go on and shatter the illusion of the transcendental order that produces as much if not more misery than it solves.  The wicked witch is miserable.  But so is the Wizard who is supposed to be the godhead.  The joy in the emerald city is that of forced labor.  The forced laughter one hears at the workplace abounds.  This is not Santa's jolly workshop. \n\n\"There's no place like home,\" truly means that one has enough.  One does not lack what transcendental systems practiced by others say one lacks.  That is how such systems operate.  On your feeling of insecurity.  Your lack of confidence when not serving its interests.  \n\nDorothy is a doer.  She is always becoming while keeping her innocence in tact.  .\n\nTranscendental systems operate by sending workers on impossible tasks, if they do not just fit into the scheme and try to rhizome in other directions.  All other directions are seen as a waste of effort and time or worse, they are potentially harmful, a threat to the order.  Either you are a part of the order or you will be put to sleep in one way or another.  \n\nIt takes Toto, a dog, to reveal the illusion of the Wizard of Oz because a dog isn't susceptible to the mental tricks that people are with regard to a transcendental system.  \n\nThe Wicked Witch is also the flipside to the Good Witch.  Both being unified as the destructive and creative forces of the cosmic fabric.  The Wicked Witch is an interesting character because despite her service to the transcendental scheme (which of course she wants to merely flip so that she is in control which will result in an equally bad outcome, keeping the transcendental system in place like when a benevolent kind is replaced by an evil one, the people still suffer indefinitely for what they are convinced they lack and so they serve in the only way they know how, through sacrifice).  \n\nThe Wicked Witch is wicked because she too has fallen for the lack.  She lacks the slippers.  If she ever were to get them, she'd only seek for something else to fill the bottomless pit of transcendentalism.  She is wicked only because she is mean in an innocent sense.  Out in the open.  She wears her costume and rides her broom stick.  Showing off like a child.  The Wizard of Oz, on the other hand, is most wicked actually.  His hiding and deception has made an Emerald City that only appears to shine but is actually dark and empty since it is run by a coward.  He sends Dorothy and her trio to their doom.  He'd rather they die and with false hope than the Wicked Witch who is screaming that she will kill them directly.  They don't know where the real danger lies.  The real wickedness.  Once revealed, the Wizard of Oz reveals the truth.  He knows if he doesn't come clean, this pure force of innocence and positivity will destroy him because they destroyed the Wicked Witch who he relied on for his transcendental order.  \n\nThe Wizard of Oz reveals that they actually lack nothing.  That they are full of potential.  That they can become rhizomes or as many things as they like.  The Emerald City has lost its shine for them because they shine through activity.  They are looking inside to satisfy their desires rather than looking outward for some magic ingredient to solve their problems.  \n\nThe film says that disaster comes whether you want it to or not and your response is everything.  It will come like a tornado threatening your home or a mean old lady who wants to put your dog down.  Do not let such defeat convince you of what you lack.  Do not blame yourself.  Do something about it.  Be resourceful.  Pull from your inexhaustible supply.  Everybody has more power in them than they can imagine.  What a positive message of rhizomatic activity!  It's far better to be a playful nomad than a slave to a system of empty promise.",

Movies like this one has a very soft spot in my heart and I've always related to this movie. I'm pretty sure of all the classic films that came out after 1939 you kind of compare them to the wizard of oz and I don't think the wizard of oz has been beat. It is one of those classic movies that has lived on for generations after generation. I really love the songs in the film which they are called musical numbers.

It plays more like a stage show or pantomime, with exaggerated performances and constant movement, and it suits the tone perfectly. You could pick holes in its plot and the logic of the Wicked Witch, who was a dumb villain before James Bond movies made it cool, but it doesn't matter. The Wizard Of Oz has resolutely stood the test of time, a symbol of the Golden Age of Hollywood, and all the magic and emotion that comes with such a label.",

Then on the trip, meets and befriends with a Scarecrow (who wants a brain), a Tin Man (who desires a heart), and a Cowardly Lion (who is in need of courage).\n\nYeah. When I was younger, though I still do this until today, I often used to put myself as a character inside of a story, either in the books or in the movie. Well not all, depends on the character itself. If I can relate to the character, even the slightest, then I do. If I can't, I separate myself from the character and look at it from an outside source, or I'll be the side character (not main character) if I'm more relate to them.\n\nI'm pretty sure this ever happened to you too. Am I right? So if you haven't watched this movie, go watch it!! especially for classics movie lovers.\n\nP.S: what I do remember too is that I'm freaking happy when I finally found this movie these days. and I'm watching it again and relive my childhood memories all over again.",

It's charming and quaint, relic of a bygone era where naivete was a-okay and being earnest wasn't seen as a handicap. Loaded with unforgettable lines and classic songs, nothing feels elbowed-in or insignificant, and I say that as a viewer with very little patience for musical interludes. Sometimes it's nice to just climb into that time capsule and relive your own childhood (as I have to think a vast majority of the current population first saw it at that age), but it also serves as an impressive example of thoughtful, creative filmmaking. The famous mid-scene switch from sepia tones to full-blown Technicolor remains especially stunning, a masterful reveal that immediately brings the land of Oz to life with a roar, and the intense, colorful landscapes that light up every scene never let up. A few seams may show here and there, particularly around the matte paintings in recent HD transfers, but in some ways that works to the film's benefit. Clearly, a tremendous amount of love and care went into this one, and that still radiates as warmly today as it did almost eighty years ago. Well-balanced, evenly paced and visually dazzling, it's aged stupendously and stands tall as a cornerstone of family cinema. My kids loved it, though they weren't as petrified of the flying monkeys as I was at their age, and I loved sharing it with them. Surprised to find I still enjoy this as much as I do.",

It's not perfect, having a few things that it never bothers to answer (for instance, what exactly is the Tin Man supposed to be? An automaton? And what about the woman who wants to put Toto down?), and it's obvious that they're trying to stretch the run time sometimes (e.g. all the singing by the Munchkins) but those are minor things and it's actually still enjoyable, and surprisingly not-cheesy, in fact not at all painful in any way really.\n\nMoreover, it was actually pretty clever, even if a bit simple. And even if it's not the best thing ever made, the status of a classic is well-earned for all of these reasons.\n\nI don't think I can say anything that anyone else hasn't said before, you all know the drill, blah blah classic blah blah watch it if you're a film buff.",

Few films have come close to its perfect flow, soundtrack, acting, plot, directing, cinematography and special effects.

My young children enjoyed this film just as much as I have over the years.\n\nI'm glad Hollywood has not bastardized this film with a \"reboot\" - yet.  The world does not need another horrible Tim Burton remake of a classic novel and/or film, as the modern treatment of Alice In Wonderland has demonstrated.\n\nWhoever is the 1 \"professional\" critic that posted a negative review of this film is a complete fool.

It is a wonderful kid's movie, but it will also entertain teenagers and grownups, especially cinephiles. With a ton of incredible sceneries, wonderful characters, funny and innovative costumes, and a beautiful plot about not only adventure, but also family and home, it makes a movie anyone can watch and enjoy.\n\nThe protagonist in The Wizard of Oz is a little girl who is tired of the farm she is living in with her family. The farm looks like a very melancholy and dark place, and it seems as if no one has time for her. She is dreaming of a wonderful place, a happy place where she can be a kid. Shortly after this, she does get what she is wishing for, as she somehow after a storm ends up waking up in a fantasy world full of wonderful creatures and happy colors. She gets greeted as a hero, after unknowingly killing an evil witch during her crash landing into the world. Very soon she realizes how worried her mom must be after losing her daughter, and decides to somehow make it back home. This is how her adventure to meet the great and mystical Wizard of Oz begins. As she is making her way to meet the wizard we get to meet a ton of new, both evil and good, fairytale-like creatures, with very convincing and straight forward character traits. Her adventure gets very suspenseful as she and her newfound friends finally get to meet the highly spoken about Wizard of Oz, it gets unclear if she is actually going to make it home. But in the end they do figure things out, and she does make it back home to her family, where she feels like she actually belongs. A lot of the music we get to hear throughout her adventure are cleverly describing what is happening, and makes the film even more fun to watch. It also serves as some help for the younger audience to keep up with the story.\n\nEven though the film is almost 80 years old, the plot has not grown old the slightest, and even though the special effects do not hold up to today's standards (it was made in 1939, so we are going to have to accept it), they are still impressive considering what year the movie was made. As a watcher you look forward to seeing the next scenery, or how the next creature will be and look like. This makes the movie very enjoyable. This also helps with the pacing, as you are always looking forward to the next scene (a lot of older movies tends to be slow paced, and sometimes therefore boring for audience nowadays). \n\nThe Wizard of Oz catches the essence of adventure, dreams and excitement. It is impossible not to smile as the creatures of this new exciting world sings songs about their newfound hero and what's awaiting her. It was a bliss watching this movie, a timeless classic! As it states in the beginning - \"Time has been powerless to put its kindly philosophy out of fashion\".\n\n/Leonard",

The opening is in B&W and it follows the story of Dorothy played by Judy Garland and Toto. When the tornado flew the house up and when it came down the B&W is gone so it changed into Colour. The B&W only began in beginning to end, the colour is in the middle. The quotes are so memorable like ''There's no place like home.'',  ''I'll get you, my pretty and your little dog, too!'' and ''Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.'' The songs are memorable too like Over the Rainbow, DIng-Dong! The Witch is Dead and many more. The Wicked Witch of the West is an evil villian who wants the ruby slippers from Dorothy.

Apart from some stupid musical numbers, this film did not have much flaws and many songs were after all good, yet redundant. The film has a string of likable characters like the three friends whom Dorothy find in the journey. The acting was genuinely good with Judy Garland as Dorothy standing out as Dorothy. Surprisingly I also found the few wits in this film to be rather sharp and likable rather than being repulsive (which was what I actually expected).",

            "content": "I would have enjoyed this movie if it weren't for all the green things: the witch, the grass, the Emerald City, the other green things. Why is green so cool nowadays? It's as if they want to force us into their liberal ideals that green is good. I ask you, why is it that \"tree hugger\" is supposed to be an insult? Because if you like nature and the world you're an idiot, that's why. Loving green things and natural things and stuff that lives outside is stupid. It's like liking things that are healthy because it's. good to be healthy. Only liberal-minded hippies enjoy breathing their \"fresh air.\" I can't wait for my company to actually successfully make BILLIONS off of our manufactured air machines. Then you all will come back here and make this movie out to be what it is, stupid.\n\nThey couldn't even make the whole thing in color. The beginning of the movie and the end ***** SPOILER ALERT***** has no color in it. Like, as in old black and white movies. They probably didn't even notice when they sent it out to direct to DVD places - direct to DVD!!!!!! I certainly don't remember this coming out in theaters, so, you tell me.\n\nIf there was a house flying in the air and it was about to land on you, you'd run away. Unfortunately, this movie's characters, especially the ones who are supposed to be the smart ones, are so dumb they let houses fall on them and they are killed by water. Oh, and don't get me started on the flying monkeys, as if that's not a direct racist commentary on Asian people. I found the dead midget hanging himself and I laughed.\n\nAlso, don't put on that Dark Side of the Sun album when you watch this because if you do, I heard you might see things.\n\nThe girl that plays Dorothy can't even sing The cover song that that fat Hawaiian guy sang on his ukulele. There's another thing - if you're going to try to be original, have your own songs. And also, don't steal from other stories like The Hunger Games and Never Ending Story, you know, actual classic, original films. \n\nIf I could give this negative stars I would. Screw the munchkins and their eerie little town too.",

            "content": "Grade: Safe 7/10\n\nThe Wizard of Oz is a classic and many consider it to be one of the best movies ever made, I have to disagree. Now don't mistake me here it isn't bad at all, it is pretty good in my opinion but I just can't say I absolutely loved it. It has it's charm and for a child then maybe they would love it but I couldn't help feel I needed to be younger to view it with such a magical view. The story is however well timed and a good length for it's kind of film and felt the ending is one of the best parts of the movie.\n\nNow Judy Garland is great in this, and I'm not just saying that because it's her and because it's Wizard Of Oz, she is a great talent here and back in the day people must have been blown away by seeing her on the big screen. One element I absolutely loved about this was the music because that really is the highlight and produces such memorable songs you forgot were even from this film, just great great fun. It feels a bit strange at times the plot, maybe a bit too random to be properly assembled but maybe an hour after watching I personally felt joyous and filled with a happy like memory from watching the movie.\n\nThe numerous directing changes don't help and although the finished product with Victor Fleming at the helm is strong, it can at parts feel messy. I didn't like the script and that is one the major reasons I can't see this as perfection, the lines are delivered well by most but the choices of wording are poor and anything like that done today would be classed as conventional and much seen before in musicals. I can't doubt the sheer mass of the cast for putting on a good show and even though the Munchkins are barely hear able with such high pitch voices, it is people like that who make this film what it is today.\n\nI think one big reason this is classed as so good is because of the big technological things seen in this and a new type of film that hadn't been seen before, and in such vivid colour. The sets are horrible and I mean nothing can be done about that for the times and although they are kind of sweet looking, nothing more positive can be said about the walls seen to create the backgrounds. One big thing technology wise that does work for me is the cinematography, beautifully shot and crafted well by Harold Rosson and you can see why he received an Academy Award nomination, just marvellous.\n\nWhen we come on to the songs things like \"Somewhere over the Rainbow\" come to mind but that isn't the only song that sticks in your head for a time after. \"Ding-Dong the Witch is Dead\" is another song famous for being a Munchkin dance and is a great song as well. \"We're off the see the Wizard\" is another absolute classic in the songbook and I can't think of any musical with so much goodness but also so many known songs, This film is lovingly crafted and so well written in the music department.\n\nOverall I felt it to be Solidly kind of good and although as you can see I don't agree with maybe most who see it, I still very much enjoyed it. If you haven't seen it then I couldn't recommend it more to you but I will say this, although loads and loads of film fans rate this number one and critics alike, don't expect to love this as much as some do, but then again you may fall in complete fantasy like love with it.",

Directed by Victor Fleming and King Vidor, this film was one of the first films made that really pushed the envelope on special effects and grand scale. So much heart was put into this. I haven't met anyone who doesn't love this film.\n\nDorothy Gale (Judy Garland) is a young Kansas girl who lives on a farm. After her dog Toto is taken from her by Miss Gulch (Margret Hamilton), the dog returns. Not knowing what to do, Dorothy and Toto run away.  When they return, a tornado is rapidly approaching the farmhouse. Dorothy is knocked unconscious. When she awakes, she has been whisked away to the magical land of Oz, and must save the land from the evil Wicked Witch, with the help of some unlikely heroes. \n\nThe acting in this film is superb and iconic. While Judy Garland isn't perfect, and her acting is a little over the top, she goes a pretty darn good job. Her companions include Ray Bolger ( The Scarecrow), Jack Haley (The Tin Man), and Bert Lahr (The Cowardly Lion). These gentlemen do a splendid job. \n\nThe set pieces are magnificent. Also, this film has astounding piratical effects. From the back drops, the tornado, and costumes, everything is top- notch and every detail is paid attention to. \n\n\"The Wizard Of Oz'' is a timeless film that touches the heart of everyone. It has memorable charming songs, great acting, impressive special effects, and shows that the old films are still, at times and in some ways, the best.",

There's something so charming about the thought that 75 years ago, there were people watching this film in the cinema, exactly as it was intended to be seen. The 3D conversion wasn't anything special, in fact I barely noticed it most of the time, but the magic of the film still shows through. Yes, some parts have aged badly, but what hasn't in seven and a half decades? So delightful, so well made, so enjoyable, try to catch it in IMAX if you can, unless you want to wait for the 100th anniversary.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nIt has been roughly around 7 months since my first viewing of this film, and back then I didn't think too highly of it as my expectations for the film was so high that it got to a point that it overwhelmed my opinion of it and found myself being disappointed with many of the film's elements. Now that enough time has passed and my knowledge of cinema has expanded, has my opinion of the film improved? Certainly, but far from the general consensus.\n\nI see Dorothy's journey in Oz as a metaphor for her transition to adulthood. She walks in the yellow path, picking up the important pieces that would lead her into becoming a virtuous and respectable adult. Though this is just a theory I have made for myself, as I only had the opportunity to see this film at a much older age, and I feel most of the film's magic is found when viewed through the eyes of a child. The film could also be seen as a \"stay at home\" message for children, preventing them from making rash and irresponsible decisions too early in their life; though viewing the film in this light found it to be difficult to maintain my interest as once a person reaches a certain age, this message comes off as irrelevant or out of date.\n\nSuperficially, as an adventure story, the film holds up well as audiences are treated to a unique world and inspiring characters, delivering an unforgettable and one of a kind experience. Though amazing, it does contain a large flaw, the film's climax. When Dorothy and the gang are given a task by the wizard, it simply lacked any of the sweet and memorable quality that was found during the first two acts. This area of the film tries so hard to be emotional and thrilling but I personally felt the film was far from delivering it, instead shows the audience a weeping Dorothy who relies too much on her company to swoop in and resolve the situation. The film also contains minor flaws but they weren't impacting enough that it affected my enjoyment of the film, but they are noticeable when it arises.\n\nThe film's most admirable aspect is its visual beauty. The film's costumes and set design just pops in glorious Technicolor, letting me be drawn in completely to the world of Oz. I can't help but smile every time I notice the immaculate detail that was given to the lead characters' costumes; with Tin Man's as the highlight. As expected from an Old Hollywood musical, one can pick up that the film is produced in a tight set; at least for contemporary standards, but if one can let themselves go and let the film's magic flow through your eyes, then one is certainly in for a treat.\n\nThe film's tunes are now regarded as universally classic. For the most part, I agree with that statement, as there is only one track from the film that holds me back from adoration and that is the \"If I Were King of the Forest\" song. Though the track has a couple of comedic moments, I felt it slowed the film down and acted as a filler or break from the character's goals. I think also because the song was occupied with only one of the film's leading characters, it made it difficult for me to care. Thankfully, the rest of the songs are as great as the popularity and affection that surrounds them. How could one resist swaying or nodding their head to the rhythm of \"We're Off to See the Wizard\" or \"Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead\"?\n\nThe acting in this film is definitely far from the film's strongest area, but it was enough to prevent me from showing any signs of cringing or irritation. The cast walks closely around the line of over-acting, particularly Judy Garland, and risks on having the film's emotion on being insincere. When it comes to their ability to deliver the choreography, they were fantastic; allowing the art of dance and movement to shape or support the personality of their characters; just look at The Scarecrow's wobbly walk down the yellow brick road.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz may be a perfect classic for some; I feel it comes up a bit short but definitely not disappointing or abysmal. It features a wonderful soundtrack and gorgeous imagery that would make one want to stay and be far away from home.",

This movie looks cheap. I don't mean that it looks fake, they didn't have the technology we have now, that's not what I mean, I just mean that it looks cheap and ugly. Also the acting was awful, and the character of Dorothy was one of the weakest and most uninteresting characters. She shows no strength, unless you count then scene where she gently flicks the cowardly lion on the nose. Also, the plot is STUPID, but that's okay if you care about the emotions and the stakes, but the acting and characters are awful, so you don't care about the emotions, and their are no stakes?

            "content": "\"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939)\n\nThe Wizard of Oz is a classic 1939 American musical fantasy film produced by MGM and based of the 1900 novel \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" L. Frank Baum, although it wasn't the first film based on the novel. There was a film in 1910, 1925 and 1933 based on the Wizard of Oz. There was a film in 1908 that actually had a lot of involvement with L. Frank Baum and the film even had scenes in color. Sadly however, this film is lost and no copies of the movie are known to exist anymore. None of these films were ever as popular as the 1939 version directed by Victor Fleming and starring Judy Garland. Although the movie got good reviews, it was not a box office success getting only $3,017,000 on a $2,777,000 budget. At the time, it was the most expensive MGM film ever made and was a commercial flop. It however was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture which lost to \"Gone With The Wind\". It however won two awards including one for Best Original Song for \"Over the Rainbow\". Although the film was a commercial failure, when it was rebroadcast on television in 1956, it became a huge hit and has since become one of the most famous films ever made. Wizard of Oz is currently the most viewed motion picture in television history and is now seen as one of the greatest films of all time. There is so much to say about this film, but I guess the best place to start is at the beginning. \n\nDorothy Gale (played by Judy Garland) is a farm girl who lives with her Aunt and Uncle on a farm in Kansas in the early 1900's. She decides to run away from home after a cruel neighbor had got a court order to take her dog Toto away. Dorothy however isn't that smart of a person, granted this is Kansas, but she is actually tricked by a phony fortune teller that her aunt is ill and encourages her to go back home. As Dorothy returns home, a powerful tornado comes and Dorothy is forced to take shelter in her home, but is knocked unconscious and wakes up to discover her house is being lifted up by the twister. She sees the woman who attempted to kill Toto who is Miss Gulch taken by the tornado and she transforms into the cackling Wicked Witch of the West on a broomstick. The farm house crash lands in the Wonderful Land of Oz in Munchkin Land. Although it wasn't the first film of its kind, it was one of the most famous classic films to be featured in color by Technicolor. The scenes in Kansas is filmed in black and white, whereas the land of Oz was filled in color and at the time, it was very rare to see a film in color, although Gone With The Wind, released that very same year was also in color. Dorothy is greeted by Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, and the Munchkins, who treat her like a hero because her house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East killing her as a result. Her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West, arrives and tries to claim the magical ruby slippers from her sister's feet, but Glinda transfers them to Dorothy's feet instead. The Wicked Witch of the West threatens Dorothy and her little dog too that she will get the Ruby Slippers back. Glinda tells Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City where the Wizard of Oz might be able to help her get back home. Along the way she meets three new friends who also want to meet the Wizard. There's the Scarecrow who wants to have a brain, Tin Man who wants a heart, and the Cowardly Lion who wants courage. So the story is about Dorothy getting to the Wizard of Oz to get back to Kansas while being accompanied by her three friends and while avoiding the Wicked Witch of the West. \n\n*CAUTION SPOILER ALERT*\n\n\nI always thought this story made no sense. Why does Glinda have such disregard to Dorothy's safety? Giving her the slippers makes her the target of the Wicked Witch of the West and she tells her not to take them off. It's not like Dorothy asked for the slippers. Glinda also doesn't tell Dorothy that she can tap her heels to go home until at the very end after they arrive at Emerald City and after the Wizard of Oz failed to get Dorothy home. What was the point of all this? It makes no sense. But whatever, this movie is still a great classic*\n\n\n*SPOILERS END HERE*\n\nThere is so much to say about this wonderful classic. During the production of the film, Bubby Ebsen, the man who was originally cast to play as Tin Man, suffered an allergic reaction to the aluminum powder makeup he was wearing for his role, got sick and was unable to play the part and the film studio had to be shut down briefly until a new actor can fill the part. Although, some speculate that he refused to be painted silver and was fired. This however is unlikely since there were photographs of the actor wearing aluminum makeup, although no film footage of his scenes were ever released. Filming was even dangerous, Margaret Hamilton, the woman who played as Miss Gulch and the Wicked Witch of the West got severely burnt during one of the scenes and spent six weeks in the hospital before she returned for her role. \n\nThe film is also noted for its musical selections and soundtrack, the most famous song is \"Over the Rainbow\" and that is considered to be one of the best original songs ever made for a motion picture. The film has since developed a lot of legends and even urban legends. One of which is if you play Pink Floyd's 1973 album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" in its entirety starting at the beginning of the movie, it apparently syncs up to what is going on. The song \"The Great Gig In The Sky\" is played when the tornado strikes, the song \"Money\" is played right after Dorothy enters the Technicolor land of Oz (color film at the time was expensive), the song \"Brain Damage\" is played when the Scarecrow sings \"If Only I Had A Brain\" and the heartbeat at the end of \"Eclipse\" is played when Dorothy puts her ear to the Tin Man's chest (The Tin Man wanted a heart). Every member of Pink Floyd has since denied any connection saying whoever discovered this had way too much time on their hands. There was also a disturbing urban legend that a Munchkin can be seen committing suicide by hanging by the neck from behind a prop tree when Dorothy, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man are singing \"We're Off to See the Wizard\". The object however was actually a bird borrowed from the Los Angeles Zoo, most likely a crane or an emu that was placed on the indoor set to make it more lively. \nThe most famous prop is the Ruby Slippers used for the film. Several were made, but only five are known to exist with one that was stolen and remains missing. One of the slippers was sold at an auction in 2000 for $666,000 making it one of the most valuable movie props of all time. \n\nThis is one of the most cherished movies of all time and almost everyone has seen this movie as a kid and it holds a special place in our hearts.\n\nFINAL RATING: \t10 out of 10",

No single moment outshines the next; in this regard, it is smooth as silk.  This movie cannot be plucked at and pulled apart, broken down into bite-sized bits to convenience today's \"put it in a nutshell\" mentality.  In fact, I was a little bit disappointed at not quite knowing why it is that I love this movie so much.  It comes from something that can't be sought after, bottled up or stored in a designated place.  It's the magic.  This movie boasts no specific frame more magical than the one before it; each one glistens with the magic of a witch's wand, or a ruby slipper, or an emerald city.  Naturally I must commend Judy Garland for knowing that and not hesitating to be a child who still believes in such wizardry.  This ageless film captivates children of all ages, and for those, like myself, who have forgotten the magic within them, it serves not as a grim reminder of what they left in childhood, but a friendly offer to bring some of the magic back, if not for just an hour-and-a-half, a prospect that brings a tear to my eye and reminds me that the magic is still there as long as beautiful things like \"The Wizard of Oz\" still exist in this crazy world.",

            "content": "Wow... this movie is so hard to review properly. It's one of those films where it's just so good to the point where it's hard to say anything wrong with it. As much as I love this movie though, The Wizard of Oz is flawed in a few different ways. So I guess let's just dive right in. I also promise not to mention \"Wicked\" too much considering the book didn't even exist yet. \r\n\r\nShould I even describe the story to you? I mean you all know it... okay might as well do this right. Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) wants to find a new place to explore Over The Rainbow and a twister of fate (literally) whisks her away to The Land of Oz. There she comes across all sort of characters like The Scarcrow with no brain, The Tin Man with no heart and a Lion with no courage at all. However, Dorothy longs to go back home but the only way to do that is to see The Wizard Of Oz. She'll have to face the Wicked witch of The West along the way with other obstacles as well. I'll just have say this movie does feel really timeless. I mean yeah there are one or two times when you can tell these people are on a movie set but a lot of the time it genuinely feels like Oz is a true and real place. \r\n\r\nThe movie is pretty to look at, but what about the characters? Honestly, they're great too. There isn't much to Dorothy as a character, but it's really touching to see how much she wants to go home because she is so worried about her Aunt Em. The Scare Crow, Tin Man and Lion more than half the time get some funny lines. The Wicked Witch of The West is awesome, but kind of one dimensional. This is why a story like Wicked is needed for this character. Almost like with Maleficent, The Wicked Witch is awesome at being evil but really doesn't have a motivation. Yeah you can make the argument she wants revenge for her faltened sister under Dorothy's house, but she never really brings her up. Supposedly, those ruby slippers have some type of power to them but again I don't see how they would be useful to a plan we know nothing about. Still, The wicked Witch is a pretty cool villain. \r\n\r\nThe music in this film is really great. I think there are only two songs I don't like. First off, the whole Munchkin song routine goes on forever and it gets old really quickly. Also, The Lion's song about wanting to be king of the forest really doesn't do anything for me either. Besides those two, I love these musical numbers. My Favorite has to be Somewhere Over The Rainbow. Can you believe they almost cut out this song for time? Wow that probably would've been a huge mistake. I have listened to Somewhere Over The Rainbow at least 120 times. Then again, I have listened to \"Defying Gravity\" probably thousands of times but again we're not suppose to be talking about Wicked aren't we? \r\n\r\nThere are two major things that really bother me in The Wizard of Oz. The first is a line spoken by The Wizard when he's giving the Tin Man his \"heart\". This line totally drives me nuts. \"It 's not important how much you love, but how much you're loved by others\". Um yeah this is pretty messed up. He completely has that line backwards. You should just love your heart out even if some people won't appreciate you for it. Anyway, the other big issue I have with this film is also a big issue a lot of people have with it. This might be somewhat of a spoiler, but again I'm sure all of you know it. Glinda pretty much knew all along  that the Ruby Slippers could've took Dorothy home 2 seconds after she got to Oz. DOn't get me wrong, I know the reasoning why Glinda didn't tell her this important fact even if I don't understand it. Dorothy was suppose to learn that her heart's desire was and always will be in Kansas. However you could make the argument that Dorothy knew this for the longest time. That's why she wouldn't stop talking about going back to Kansas. All Glinda had to do was tell her and she wouldn't have almost died at the hands of The Wicked Witch. So Dorothy was put in the middle of this huge mess in Oz because...? Yeah that's a huge problem in an otherwise great film. \r\n\r\nThe Wizard of Oz is truly an amazing film. Yeah, there are two huge problems that make it impossible to say it's a perfect film but I think being amazing is enough. It has great songs, great characters, a wonderful (sometimes confusing) story and also great acting from the entire cast. Needless to say, I highly recommend The Wizard of Oz.",

Similar to what I said in my Mary Poppins review it's seems more magical and special than movies that had everything created by computers. Who hasn't wanted to visit Oz at one point in their lives? The perfomances are great, and extremly iconic. The songs are all cute, and impossible to get out of your head. Once they're in there there's no getting them out.

So then I just avoided watching it as I grew up. On the rare occasion that I watched it I just couldn't enjoy it. Recently my wife received Wizard of Oz on DVD, though, and insisted I give it another chance. I figured there was a chance I might have always prejudged it based on my first experience, so I gave it a shot. Sorry, but I just don't get it. Clearly this feels like a kids' movie but they include so many creepy elements from a wicked witch to flying monkeys. Frankly I even find the Munchkins a little unsettling. I'm not even sure they effectively explain the \"lesson\" that Dorothy learns at the end. \n\nJudy Garland acts like a five-year-old while looking like a twenty-year-old. On the positive side she definitely can sing. The songs are probably the biggest highlight of the film. I thought all the acting was just too melodramatic. This is why I'm convinced it's intended as a children's movie because there is zero subtlety to any of the performances. My favorite acting in the film all comes from Frank Morgan, who also adds 90% of the humor to the story. He plays 5 different characters better than most of the others play 1.\n\nPerhaps my biggest issue with this movie is how illogical it all seems. Glinda could send Dorothy home from the beginning but sends her on a pointless quest first? Glinda forces the ruby slippers on Dorothy's feet, creating the entire conflict between her and the wicked witch? The wizard sends a little girl to commit murder for him, for no particular reason? And none of that even mentions the worst part, because no resolution came in the Toto-vs-Gulch situation, so she'll just come back and have him put to sleep as before. So the primary conflict is never resolved. Dorothy wasn't running away because she didn't appreciate home, she was running away to save her pet. Yeah, so I give up. This clearly is not a film that is for me, and I'd be fine never watching it again, but I'll still listen to the soundtrack for some of those good songs.",

It is like a family tradition to pass this movie's existence to their kids and grandkids. It is the first achievement in animation history, it's the first movie to  be shown in living color, to use convincing live staging effects, and it had a fun cast of characters and music. Imagine growing up in the late 1930s. The world of films were slowly emerging, and all people saw were black and white movies. Back then, these people had no TVs or computers to tell them about upcoming movies, all they had were newspapers, and movie posters. People just came across how The Wizard of Oz was playing, they decided to see what the big deal is. It starts off as a simple colorless movie, but imagine being one of the few who saw it's original release, and how they couldn't believe their eyes when the movie starts showing in color.",

The set design, costumes, make-up, special effects and cast were absolutely phenomenal, especially considering it was all done in 1939. The clarity in the re-mastered edition is a great sight to see. Oz set the standard for films back in the day, but few have ever come close to capturing countless generations imaginations as this classic has succeeded in doing.

Even the giant IMAX screen with its higher definition made some of the props and backgrounds suddenly look much more fake, cheapening their appearance. That saddened me but other aspects were still amazing, especially the quality of some of the special effects used 75 years ago! For instance, Glenda, The Good Witch's entrances via her giant pink bubble. And yes, the IMAX screen and probably the 3-D made Glenda even more resplendent in that sparkly cotton candy pink confection of a gown and her translucent glittery crown. I even noticed for the first time that her sparkly necklace was in the shape of a butterfly, and I would not have thought I could have possibly missed any such detail in past viewings. LOL! Plus, the landings and takeoffs of the flying monkeys are still impressive decades later! All-in-all, for any longtime fan of the film, it's probably worth having this special viewing experience. :)",

Everything I have seen in this movie is amazing! It has magic the whole family will enjoy. The movie is filled with great performances, music and songs.\n\nA tale from L. frank Baum, The Wizard of Oz tells the story of Dorothy, (played by a legendary Judy Garland), a young farm girl who live in Kansas. One day, an earthquake appears and takes Dorothy and her dog, Toto to the magical world of Oz, a place filled with pure imagination. While in Oz, she meets the Wicked Witch of the West, who really loves those red ruby shoes she has on. While she tries avoiding the witch, the nice creatures and people in Oz tell her to follow the yellow brick road. While walking, she meets a scarecrow, a tin man, and a lion. They all wish that had something that would be so special to them, The Scarecrow wishes for a brain, The Tin Man wishes for a Heart, and The Lion wishes for Courage, but Dorothy has the biggest wish of them all, to get back home to Kansas. They all must go see the Wonderful a Wizard of Oz which leads them to an adventure filled with creatures, weird people, and the Witch. \n\nThe Wizard of Oz is a beloved classic for everyone. The songs are great, the music is wonderful, the screenplay is magnificent, the acting is fantastic, and the effects are really well done. The art direction is fantastically beautiful, the costume design is amazing, and the adventure in the movie triumphs! I think this should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1939.",

            "content": "Time for another one of THOSE reviews. Well, what can I say, this movie is anus. The Wizard of Oz is a prime example of how nostalgia can sway a person's opinion on a movie. Every critic who gave this a fresh score did so only because they probably fell in butt-love with it when they were six and never decided to grow up. And as it is with most kid's movies, people say that it should be judged on a different scale, as the target audience is different. My response? FUCK YOU. A movie's so-called 'target audience' should not be called into question when giving it a score. By that logic, if a film is made by retards, about retards, FOR retards, and it does the job well, it should get 100%. And that is something I cannot abide.\r\n\r\nHence, my hatred for The Wizard of Oz. This film isn't just bad, it's GRATING. It's a kid's movie, so you shouldn't expect much of it, but GOOD HOLY FUCK, they could have made some effort. The supposedly 'great' line \"Toto... I don't think we're in Kansas anymore...\" is not only corny, it is delivered in such a way that is just painful to the ears. Every line is overexaggerated, every moment is over the top, and every performance is just fucking awful. This is the point where people usually say \"Calm down, man... it's just a kid's movie.\" EXACTLY. It's made for kids, who are clearly undemanding in their entertainment and too 'impressionable' to handle real cinema like Pulp Fiction or Fight Club without getting their brains turned to mush. The fact that our professional critics would dare to give good reviews to this safe, alarmingly small-minded movie should be enough to make us think for at least a minute about the current state of our society.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard of Oz is about Dorothy, a stereotypical Kansas girl whose character is entirely one-dimensional, and who is played horribly by Judy Garland, who gives the term 'emoting' a whole new meaning. She's on-par with Jake Lloyd in The Phantom Menace on my list of \"Most Annoying Performances of All Time.\" Is it supposed to be 'heartwarming?' Supposedly. But to someone who hasn't obsessed over this movie and the supposed 'impact' it made on cinema for his whole life, I find it to be grating and unwatchable. None of the performances, in fact, are any good. They're loud, sure, and they grip your attention because of it-- but not in a good way. People say the special effects are good, which they might have been for the time, but looking back now, they're really not. The makeup makes everyone look retarded, and half the time you're nervous that Dorothy is going to accidentally knock over the backdrop painting instead of paying attention to the movie.\r\n\r\nThe plot itself is just fucking retarded. Dorothy gets a severe blow to the head (which actually explains a lot), and has a hallucination in which she's whisked away to the magical land of Oz. Apparently, back in the 30s, color film qualified as 'magic.' A buttload of annoying creatures called munchkins greet her, and they sing. Their singing is the worst of all fucking time. Seriously. It's like the Ewoks from Star Wars removed their bear costumes, joined hands, inhaled Helium, and danced around while singing the most retarded song of all time. She then meets up with the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, and the Tin Man, three lame characters played by three even lamer actors. After jackassing around in the woods for a half an hour, they defeat the Wicked Witch of the West (who, in a remake, would be played by Barbara Boxer) by pouring water on her. So... that was easy. Also, all the witch really ever did was fly around and yell at them, writing shit in the sky. Kind of a harsh punishment for that...\r\n\r\nAnyway, now for the ultimate dumb moment in all of cinema: The Good Witch tells Dorothy that she could have gone home whenever she wanted to just by clicking her heels. GREAT ADVICE, BITCH! That would probably have come in handy a little earlier! And then Dorothy wakes up... and IT WAS ALL A DREAM. Not in an Inception-like way, where the dream actually impacts reality-- BUT JUST A REGULAR FUCKING PIPE DREAM BROUGHT ON BY A SEMI-SEVERE CONCUSSION!!! What was the point of the movie then? The stakes couldn't be raised because THERE WERE NO STAKES!!! She was fine for the whole fucking time!!! It's the ultimate cop-out ending, and makes the entire movie pointless BY DEFINITION. God, this movie suuuuucks...\r\n\r\nFinal Score for The Wizard of Anus: 1/10 stars. Really, I only hate this enough to give it a 3 or a 2, but seeing how overrated and hyped it is makes me hate it even more. Nostalgic old people love this movie, and young reviewers like it because frankly, they're scared to give it a bad review. But there is literally no redeeming value in this enormous load of cinematic anus. Not since Hugo and Up have the critics failed so monumentally as they have with The Wizard of Oz. It's horribly written, it's poorly acted, and the visuals (although impressive 70 years ago, I'm sure) have not held up whatsoever. One of the most overhyped pieces of shit ever made.",

The hills rolling in the background, the trees that recede into the distance. Everything is not lifelike - it doesn't need to be. It is fantastical and beautiful.\r\nSure, the movie may be too obvious at times. But Jesus Christ, this is American mythology, immortalized in our most interesting medium - film. It is pure joy. And trust me, the 3D effects that enhance its visuals have done much justice.\r\nTo watch this movie on the big screen is amazing. This movie has a heart of pure gold, I tell you.

If you've seen my reviews before, you probably also are aware of how much I tend to like film less when they are put back in theaters with 3-D added to it and how I usually see this as a bad thing. So do I say the same about the Wizard of Oz? Well hold on to your shorts because this is one of the few films I actually am glad they put back in theaters. Sure the 3-D is unnecessary as always, but this film is so harmless, so innocent, and so close to flawless for its time that I don't see any harm in re-releasing the crap out of this film because it's one of those rare films that no matter what your age, upbringing, or view, you should at least watch at least once in your lifetime. I mean it, this movie is so hard to find any real flaw in, with only tiny rumors around it being the one tiny questionable thing about it. Another thing is that if a movie from so long ago still demands being seen after this many years, it really says something about the quality of the movie. For its time, it was a pretty amazing film and while the effects may not be as shiny these days, it stands out so much more and is so much better than a lot of things we see pop up into theaters. While Star Wars Ep. 1 had no reason to be re-released, and Titanic had very shaky ground on being re-released, the Wizard of Oz is a movie that can be re-released and still remain as a solid classic. Its got so much charm to it that it's hard to hate and it has enough of a gentle touch that its hard to find offense in it. After so many years, I don't see any reason not to go see this again. If you want to revisit the movie, bring the family along or even just watch a good classic, I don't see any wrong in going to the theaters again to watch this one.",

            "content": "Some munchkins were not particularly good actors. \"King of the Forest\" is not particularly catchy. I saw some lip sync issues. Okay, got that out of my system. This is still one of my all time favourite movies. A dazzling landscape that pops out in a uniquely early technicolour fashion (filming in colour with the appropriate colours would likely dazzle less), songs and lines that are short and brisk enough to stick in the memory and still resonate beyond culture beating them to death, acting that brings so much humanity to the fantastical story (especially Judy Garland), and the story. Phew. I do not recommend facing The Wizard of Oz as a direct political allegory; save that for the original book. Still, some comparisons are out there in the open. Look at Scarecrow. He don't know any better than to remain on his farm, but if he had a brain, he would know what to do with it. The Wizard is all bark and no bite, unlike Toto, but under the shroud of his chamber, he can pose as a fearless, uncompromising leader. Dorothy would love to see a world other than what she has known for her life, but she feels beholden to her family and friends, thus feels content in the subpar lifestyle of rural Kansas. Heavy-handed, does this sound? Think again. This film moves quickly and with a hop at every step. The actors are highly committed to their roles. And it's so funny. The Cowardly Lion is perhaps my favourite movie character to impersonate, in how quickly he drops a dime from snarls to weeping. As the story unfolds, you will notice many familiar tropes in storytelling. \"Only bad witches are ugly?\" Eek. And yet, no matter how tired you might have been of them, The Wizard of Oz takes you on such a whimsical, hopeful adventure in hardly any time at all. It is shockingly ageless.",

            "content": "We're off to see the wizard, the adequately entertaining, but somewhat dated and narratively thin 'Wizard of Oz'!\" Yeah, they might be giving this film a bit more credit than it deserves just for being old, as well as innovative for its time, even when it comes to tone, because, let me tell you, when I was a kid, even I got kind of freaked out by the flying monkeys, and in 1939, I bet that they left the grown men stuttering like the Cowardly Lion for the next couple Judy Garland films, though that may have just been Garland's legs after she got good and grown up. It's good that she had that going for her after this film, because she was cuter at 16, and if you think that that's kind of weird to say, this film is so old that I think that it came out at a time when 16-year-olds were already married, with children, and a place in the Senate of the Roman Empire or something. No, this film can't possibly be that terribly old, because I had always figured that the '60s was the best time to get the type of dope which just had to have gone into this film, or at least into the minds of this film's viewers back in 1939. Man, this trippy flick has always been mighty popular, and I'm betting Victor Fleming was glad of that, because if I'm going to make time to knock something the same year I did \"Gone with the Wind\", I better get paid back well. Man, forget Fleming, this film and \"Gone with the Wind\" bled Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer dry, so if they didn't succeed, Fleming would have his life to worry about more than his money (He made this film and \"Gone with the Wind\" in one year, so it's not like he had all that much time to spend on having a life). Well, lucky for MGM, 1939 was anything but the year they saw flop, because this film and its fellow Fleming flick were quite the hit, though that's not to say that this film comes close to the level of \"Gone with the Wind\", being held back by a number of factors.\r\n\r\nA late 1930s family fluff piece, this film has, of course, dated quite a bit over the years, though it couldn't have been entirely cleansed of cheesiness at the time of its release, and it's certainly not cleansed of corniness now, as its lighter moments get to be too fluffy for their own good, sometimes to a slightly annoying extent, and when it comes to the deeper areas of this film's substance, it's also dated, with no subtlety and only so much weight. Sure, I wouldn't have expected too much from this film back in '39, so I'm certainly not asking for all that much depth to this classic fluff flick, but it's all so very superficial, and all too often to a cheesy extent which challenges your investment about as much as dating within pacing sensibilities. At just over 100 minutes, the film is both rather short on a general level, as well as longer than it probably should be, and you are reminded of this by a certain unevenness in pacing, whose more hurried moments slam-bang exposition, and whose less swift areas get to be a bit carried away in repetitious padding. Really, pacing inconsistency isn't a terribly big problem, or at least the slow spells are not nearly as frequent as the hurried spells, but it still stands, messing with the momentum of the film's focus until you end up with plotting that kind of takes longer than it probably should to tell a story so simple. Again, pacing issues aren't considerable, and while cheesiness is, it's a bit easier to forgive, considering the fact that this fluff piece was done quite a while back, so as far as consequential shortcomings are concerned, not much is wrong with this film, which is still kind of underwhelming, largely thanks to natural shortcomings, because as much fun as this tale may be, there's nothing much to it. This classic fluff piece really is not much more than a classic fluff piece, and that's fine and all, as it makes for some pretty entertaining classic cinema, but at the end of the day, without its historical significance and fair deal of still-memorable strength, there wouldn't be too much to remember within this somewhat cheesy, uneven and limited piece of fantasy fare. That being said, even without taking its historical significance into consideration, this film is an enjoyable one, whose shortcomings are undeniable, but challenged enough by aspects which were groundbreaking at the time and are still impressive now, with musical aspects being particularly strong against the test of time.\r\n\r\nBy no means was Herbert Stothart's score especially groundbreaking at the time, or especially outstanding, but to this day it is undeniably quite strong, with a classical tastefulness and color which flavor up entertainment value, especially when bonded with sharp lyrics by Harold Arlen and lively vocals in order to produce one delightful musical number after a while. Whether when it's complimenting tone with tasteful score work or flavoring up the fun factor with justly legendary songs, the musical aspects cannot be taken away from this film, bringing life to its world every bit as much as Cedric Gibbons', George Gibson's, Wade B. Rubottom's and Elmer Sheeley's art direction, which certainly raises a standard, for although some of the film's designs have become dated, whether they be production designs by Malcolm Brown, William A. Horning and Jack Martin Smith, or costume designs by Adrian, the components into the making of this film's distinct world still hold up as colorfully intricate and eminently memorable, especially when their beauty is really fleshed out by Harold Rosson's cinematography. Needless to say, Rosson's efforts have become quite dated over the years, but you have appreciate them for their uniqueness for the time, and for their still being quite impressive on the whole, with a handsomely grainy bronze tone to the first act that often resembles some kind of a tastefully done old photography, while the Technicolor-charged body of the film bounces the rich depths of color in a striking way that is still eye-catching to this day. Technically and stylistically, the film hasn't made it through the test of time spotless, but the visuals which do a lot to drive this fluff piece remain nothing short of remarkable, and you just cannot see this film without them, partially because the film doesn't have too much going for it when it comes to substance. The film may be stylistically strong, but it has only so much to offer when it comes to story weight, and even then, this timeless tale is by no means terribly unengaging, because it's so distinctly unique, as well as colorful at its core, particularly when it comes to presenting exceptionally memorable characters, brought to life by colorful performances, many of which have become rather dated as kind of hammy, but not so much so that you can't see the charm within most every member of this cast, especially show-stealingly delightful secondary leads Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and, last but not at all least, Bert Lahr. A young Judy Garland is fine and all, but Bolger's, Haley's and Lahr's color do more than you'd expect in bringing this fun flick to life, and yet, the performance that really drives the entertainment value of this fluff piece is a certain offscreen one by Victor Fleming, whose boastful atmosphere does thin subtlety no favors, but also adds much to the kick of tonal heights in storytelling, while keeping consistent in thorough entertainment value. No matter what the nostalgic critics may say, you shouldn't expect much from this film, and sure enough, the final product doesn't offer all that much reward value, but it does offer much entertainment value, anchored by heartfelt storytelling, flavored up by a colorful style, and ultimately abundant enough to make a very fun, if flawed fluff classic.\r\n\r\nWhen it's time to go the way of Elton John and bid goodbye to the Yellow Brick Road, underwhelmingness stands supported by cheesy dating, pacing unevenness and, worst of all, a thinness in subject matter weight which is considerable enough for the final product to fall quite a ways short of truly rewarding, and yet, through a delightful soundtrack, exceptional art direction, lively cinematography and an at least colorful story concept, brought to life about as much as it can by charismatic performances - particularly from Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr - and upbeat directorial storytelling, Victor Fleming's \"The Wizard of Oz\" is left to stand as an improvable, but fun fluff piece of cinema's golden age.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nIt has been roughly around 7 months since my first viewing of this film, and back then I didn't think too highly of it as my expectations for the film was so high that it got to a point that it overwhelmed my opinion of it and found myself being disappointed with many of the film's elements. Now that enough time has passed and my knowledge of cinema has expanded, has my opinion of the film improved? Certainly, but far from the general consensus.\n\nI see Dorothy's journey in Oz as a metaphor for her transition to adulthood. She walks in the yellow path, picking up the important pieces that would lead her into becoming a virtuous and respectable adult. Though this is just a theory I have made for myself, as I only had the opportunity to see this film at a much older age, and I feel most of the film's magic is found when viewed through the eyes of a child. The film could also be seen as a \"stay at home\" message for children, preventing them from making rash and irresponsible decisions too early in their life; though viewing the film in this light found it to be difficult to maintain my interest as once a person reaches a certain age, this message comes off as irrelevant or out of date.\n\nSuperficially, as an adventure story, the film holds up well as audiences are treated to a unique world and inspiring characters, delivering an unforgettable and one of a kind experience. Though amazing, it does contain a large flaw, the film's climax. When Dorothy and the gang are given a task by the wizard, it simply lacked any of the sweet and memorable quality that was found during the first two acts. This area of the film tries so hard to be emotional and thrilling but I personally felt the film was far from delivering it, instead shows the audience a weeping Dorothy who relies too much on her company to swoop in and resolve the situation. The film also contains minor flaws but they weren't impacting enough that it affected my enjoyment of the film, but they are noticeable when it arises.\n\nThe film's most admirable aspect is its visual beauty. The film's costumes and set design just pops in glorious Technicolor, letting me be drawn in completely to the world of Oz. I can't help but smile every time I notice the immaculate detail that was given to the lead characters' costumes; with Tin Man's as the highlight. As expected from an Old Hollywood musical, one can pick up that the film is produced in a tight set; at least for contemporary standards, but if one can let themselves go and let the film's magic flow through your eyes, then one is certainly in for a treat.\n\nThe film's tunes are now regarded as universally classic. For the most part, I agree with that statement, as there is only one track from the film that holds me back from adoration and that is the \"If I Were King of the Forest\" song. Though the track has a couple of comedic moments, I felt it slowed the film down and acted as a filler or break from the character's goals. I think also because the song was occupied with only one of the film's leading characters, it made it difficult for me to care. Thankfully, the rest of the songs are as great as the popularity and affection that surrounds them. How could one resist swaying or nodding their head to the rhythm of \"We're Off to See the Wizard\" or \"Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead\"?\n\nThe acting in this film is definitely far from the film's strongest area, but it was enough to prevent me from showing any signs of cringing or irritation. The cast walks closely around the line of over-acting, particularly Judy Garland, and risks on having the film's emotion on being insincere. When it comes to their ability to deliver the choreography, they were fantastic; allowing the art of dance and movement to shape or support the personality of their characters; just look at The Scarecrow's wobbly walk down the yellow brick road.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz may be a perfect classic for some; I feel it comes up a bit short but definitely not disappointing or abysmal. It features a wonderful soundtrack and gorgeous imagery that would make one want to stay and be far away from home.",

            "content": "\"I am Oz, the Great and Powerful!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1939, director Victor Fleming created two Technicolor masterpieces in the same year; The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind. The first release, The Wizard of Oz, remains to this day a cinematic masterpiece and one of the greatest movies of all-time.\r\n\r\nBased on the book by L Frank Baum, The Wizard of Oz tells the story of Kansas farmgirl Dorothy (Judy Garland), who longs to go over the rainbow with her dog Toto into a better place. When a tornado sends them to the Land of Oz, Dorothy enjoys her life there until it's discovered that her house killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton), wants revenge. With the help of Glinda the Good Witch (Billie Burke), Dorothy sets out to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard of Oz (Frank Morgan) to send her back home.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, Dorothy teams up with The Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), who has no brains, The Tinman (Jack Haley), who longs for a heart, and The Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), who lacks courage, to get to the wizard to get what they need. But the Wicked Witch, still sore about Dorothy's unintentional killing of her sister, sets out with her flying monkeys to kill Dorothy and her companions before they meet the Great and Powerful Oz.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why The Wizard of Oz worked so well is how the film was set up. The Kansas scenes were filmed in black-and-white, while the scenes in Oz were filmed in Technicolor. When Dorothy opens the door and enters the colorful Oz for the first time, you know that the film would be special.\r\n\r\nThe visuals still remain impressive for a 70-year plus old film. From Dorothy's enterance to Oz, to the apperance of the flying monkeys, Victor Fleming manages to put in that magic spark in order to make Oz the most believable, even if the film was set on a studio backlot.\r\n\r\nAlso, the film succeeds in its cast and characters. Margaret Hamilton is evil and menacing as the witch, and has some pretty memorable lines (\"I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too.\") Jack Haley is an entertaining Tin Man, Ray Bolger is fun and memorable as the Scarecrow, and Buurt Lahr is hilarious as the Cowardly Lion. Frank Morgan, who plays the wizard, is also a treat to watch, especially when we find out who the wizard really is (\"Pay no attention to the man behind this curtain!\")\r\n\r\nBut it's Judy Garland's performance as Dorothy that really makes the film worthwhile. When she misses her home in Kansas, you feel for her and root for her when she hits her difficult challenges. Toto the dog is also a memorable character, and is extremely well-trained.\r\n\r\nWhile keeping the adventuros fantasy elements in the book, The Wizard of Oz is also a musical. Many of the songs are pretty fun for a musical, and adds depth to the characters in the film. Judy Garland gives me goosebumps when she sings the most famous song, \"Over the Rainbow.\" She sounds like a doll and provides one of Hollywood's greatest songs. There's also \"The Munchkin Song\", performed by the Munchkins, which features some catchy tunes. The four main characters perform another well-known classic, which is only one chorus, called \"We're Off to See the Wizard\", which is an instant stuck-in-your head song. The cast performs \"The Wonderful Land of Oz\" when arriving in Oz, and is another highlight in the film. Bert Lohr, The Cowardly Lion, performs the hilarious and memorable \"If I Were the King of the Forrrrresttttttttttttt!\", which is very funny and gives everyone a good laugh no matter how old you are. \r\n\r\nThere is nothing more for me to say. The Wizard of Oz is one of the greatest films of all-time and remains one of the best films to watch with your family, even if the fling monkeys have scarred many kids for life. It's still G-rated though.\r\n\r\n\"There's no place like home.\"",

            "content": "My early plan to watch Sam Raimi's OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL (2013) has been successfully foiled by the tepid reviews and in fear of another ALICE IN WONDERLAND (2010, 6/10) travesty, then it stroke to me that I had never even watched the worldly-famous 1939 version, it must be a presumably safe and better alternative. \n\nI'm indisputably way past the age which will be exalting to watch this family-friendly vaudeville for the very first time, I wish I could have done that around my childhood year so I would be more in shock-and-awe admiration for this haute crowd-pleaser and ground-breaking studio-based product. \n\nIt all begins in Kansas, young Dorothy lives in a farm with his uncle and auntie, (after a melancholic rendition of OVER THE RAINBOW, still astounding and flawless) her tentative runaway with her cuddly puppy Toto has been persuaded by Professor Marvel (a very first introduction of multi-personae performance from Frank Morgan), en route, a twister rampages the farm and Dorothy and Toto (along with the house) has been brought to Wizard Oz's wonderland with the casualty of a star-crossed wicked witch (crushed by the house accidentally), and the shoddy superimposition of the airborne journey may be cutting-edge 74 years earlier, sadly it barely works even under an uncritical eye. \n\n  The tangible visual transference from sepia farmland to the variegated Oz land grants a soothing refreshment and heralds a jovial adventure ahead, sing-a-longs with DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD (new entry at No. 2 in this week at UK Singles Chart in the wake of Thatcher's death), it is just carefree and mollifying one's hard-pressed nerves (if you have those). Then the classic characters (Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion) successively accompany Dorothy to meet the great and mighty Oz. \n  \nDespite of its all-comprising industry-reeking indoor design, it is a marvel how the film could be made in such a laborious scale and obedient order at its time, entering the second half of the film, when insouciant singing-and-dancing gives its way to the escapade of taking back the broomstick of The Wicked Witch of the West, all the set pieces are incontrovertibly stale and the logic of the story sags into an untenable farce (no specific elucidation of how the witch would succumb to a basin of water or what is so special about the red shoes the witch is hankering for, et al). The guarded-gate of the witch's castle must be the recipient of the homage from Sauron's gate from THE LORD OF THE RINGS.\n\nActing-wise, Judy Garland is humble, mawkish but naturalistic in delivering jejune lines, Bert Lahr's Lion and Ray Bolger's Scarecrow otherwise are the film's best offers, also Margaret Hamilton's heinous witch, simply wish she had more venom to spill. \n\nOverall, it is a cartoon-ish adaption of children's best-known bedtime story, may be predisposed to be an overrated sensation which stands flimsily after a serious filmic anatomy, but the bent of director Victor Fleming and his crew has been testified positively through the arduous endeavour, and one can still relish 75-or-so years after its inception.",

            "content": "I have a theory that this movie has probably been seen by more people than any other movie. The fact that it comes to us as children is probably the reason why. Other films like 'Gone With the Wind', 'Citizen Kane', 'The Godfather', 'Star Wars', have been seen by a lot of people but in each case I can imagine people that might not have seen them. In the case of 'The Wizard of Oz' it's hard to imagine anyone who might not have seen it at some point in their lives. Almost everyone you talk to has a memory of their first experience. The reason this movie remains the most beloved of Hollywood films even after six decades is because 'The Wizard of Oz' is unique among motion pictures in that it mirrors our longings and imaginations as children.\n\nThe movie, in front of and behind the scenes, has become movie folklore. We love the legends about the rotating directors, from George Cukor to King Vidor to Victor Fleming. We know the legend of Buddy Ebsen who had to drop out due to an allergic reaction to the Tin Man makeup and Margaret Hamilton whose dress caught fire and nearly had her face burned off because of the copper-based make-up. We love stories about the problems on the set between personal feuds, sweltering costumes, partying munchkins and the costume designer who had to keep up with Judy Garland's developing bust line. There's even a spurious legend of a ghost on the set. All of these elements make 'The Wizard of Oz' a much bigger legend than it already it, but that's okay because this is the one movie that deserves to be over-hyped. It occupies such a large part of our memories that we want to make it more than it is, to just have one more reason to make it more than a movie, we want it to be a life experience.\n\nThat experience is brought to us because we are intimately familiar with its story elements. The dreams that Dorothy sings about and the adventure that follows seem to mirror our yearnings as children. She imagines a bigger place where her problems don't linger and she is free to explore them. She imagines a place where there isn't any trouble and people actually listen to what she has to say. She sees the rainbow as her golden gate to a better place because in her drab Kansas world, the rainbow is the only source of color that she knows. She dreams of a bigger place and imagines a world where troubles melt like lemondrops. We can relate. How many of us as kids sat in our room or in our yards and played, imagining a place to go and characters to interact with, a colorful world bigger than our small, confined worlds.\n\nOz is meant to represent the colorful palette of our imagination but for Dorothy it is also a place where she does some growing up. The three friends that she meets along the way, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Lion are emblematic of the lessons of bravery, love and devotion and the ability to think for ourselves. The Wicked Witch of the West certainly represents the real dangers along the way. For Dorothy there is a matronly figure, Glinda the Good Witch who intends for Dorothy to discover for herself how to solve her problems, she knows that Dorothy must grow up along the way. In a way, she seems to represent the parent that Dorothy doesn't have back in Kansas. Her aunt and uncle love her but this was a movie made during the depression and we imagine the climate that they live in, where work means keeping the farm. No work = no farm = no home.\n\nFor 1939, Dorothy was the perfect character for young girls. She echoes many of the small town country girls who, in the midst of the depression, packed their suitcases and ran to Hollywood seeking fame and fortune in the movies. For them this film is a cautionary tale that they'd be better off if they just stayed home. Judy Garland was perfect in the role, 17 at the time, but with wide-eyes and a beautiful, open face she carries that sense of wonderment of a child. Like most of us as children, her only true companion is a dog named Toto and the most frightening moment in the film is when she is nearly robbed of her best friend. When she sings 'Over the Rainbow' we know that it's to escape an unhappy childhood (she has apparently lost her parents) and for Garland we identify. She began in show business as a kiddie act with her sisters and began her long movie career when she was only 13. She was already a familiar face from 'Love Finds Andy Hardy' and by the time of 'Oz' she was already under contract to MGM. That she was familiar to audiences helped her in the role. That familiarity works well with her ability to project the vulnerability and melancholy that the character has to have. We have to believe that she will become frightened and that her life will be in danger because if she doesn't that we sense that the character can work her way out of the situation herself and our interest wanes.\n\nIf movies are a time capsule than 'The Wizard of Oz' wonderfully captures a brief moment of happiness in Garland's life. We know of her problems with studio execs that put her through an exhausting schedule and used drugs to get her going in the morning then put her to sleep at night. We know the legends of her mental and physical problems that dogged her most of her life but 'The Wizard of Oz' sees her at a moment in her life when it all seemed perfect, just as her star was rising and before her problems really began. There's poignancy in that, and that's why I think that the casting of Shirley Temple in the role would have been a mistake. By 1939, Temple was the biggest star in the world her presence in the film would have been too much, she would have stood out and we would only seen Shirley Temple, not Dorothy Gale.\n\nGarland's presence allows the story a certain credibility. I have tried to imagine that famous dance down the Yellow Brick Road with a 4 foot child and it just doesn't fit.\n\nIf Garland gives the film its center than I think the production design, awe-inspiring in 1939, is the perfect backdrop. In these early musicals filmed on a soundstage it isn't hard to spot where the soundstage ends. Some have seen that as a flaw but I think it adds to the dreamlike quality of the film. The matte paintings behind the sets add to the storybook quality. The fact that we're in a dream makes it okay that the special effects look a little hasty. That was the genius of the screenplay, that and to establish the Oz characters as characters that Dorothy meets in Kansas. In our dreams we often see people and events that have recently occurred in our lives, but this is the first time I've ever seen it expressed in a movie. In particular is the notion that Professor Marvel keeps showing up as various characters in the dream.\n\nWhat generosity the filmmakers had. What ingenuity to create this entire world that is colorful and beautiful and scary. What depth of character they created. What messages they send. This is a movie constructed with loving care. We're told that those who worked on the film just thought of this as just another movie, but when I watch the film I find that hard to believe. Certainly from the screenwriters. I wonder if they saw how brilliantly they were tapping our frustrations and our excitement, our dreams, our need and our sense of wonderment. I wonder if they knew the impact of what they were working on, that the lovely sentiments that they created would still resonate 60 years later. I wonder if they knew that their heart's desires weren't that far from our own.",

Because as a kid, I survived a viewing of The Wizard of Oz.\n\nIt is true that I no longer find movies frightening. Some of them, like The Shining, are downright creepy, but I haven't been scared by a movie since I was a young boy. The Wizard of Oz with its evil flying monkeys, wicked witches, and the gigantic phantom-like head of Oz himself - accompanied by smoke and fire - was frightening enough to make me hide under the bed for the rest of my life. I'm telling you, that scene where the Wicked Witch of the West throws a fireball that ignites the scarecrow nearly made me mess my little drawers. Even the opening scenes with the dread Almira Gulch and the nasty Kansas twister had me palpitating in my pajamas. \n\nAlthough I won't admit to being scared by it anymore, I still watch The Wizard of Oz every year or two. It is incredible that this film was made in 1939. The special effects for that day and age are astounding (I still don't know how they realized those soaring simians). The whole movie seems fresh and ageless.\n\nThe entire cast is outstanding, led by Judy Garland's unforgettable turn as Dorothy Gale. Heck, even Terry as Toto gives one of the most memorable canine performances of all time. \n\nPerhaps the most enduring and endearing scene is Garland's rendering of the Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg song, Over the Rainbow. Just watching that scene makes me think of spring - you know; rainbows, bluebirds, skies that are blue, and impending tornadoes.\n\nDirector Victor Fleming gives us the film's opening and closing scenes in sepia-toned black and white. The scenes in Oz are in Technicolor. This is a stroke of interpretive genius, giving the whole Oz experience a fantastic dreamlike quality. \n\nThe fact that Fleming directed this and Gone With The Wind in the same year is astounding. I'm not sure I've seen a movie this decade that can match either of these.",

            "content": "\"There's no place like home.\" Do I even need to say anymore? This classic film is iconic in every way and a family favorite in nearly every household. \n\nPLOT:Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) is a farm girl living in the grey plains of Kansas with her Aunt Em (Clara Blandick) and Uncle Henry (Charles Grapewin). Even though she's a young girl, she dreams big of traveling the lands before her. However, a tornado comes along and sweeps her house up with her and Toto, her little dog, inside. The house comes down in the town of Munchkinland in the wonderful land of Oz. To find her way back home, she has to find the wizard in the Emerald City while avoiding the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton), who's out to get her for dropping a house on her sister. On the way, she meets a Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), a Tin Woodsman (Jack Haley), and a Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), who choose to accompany her on her journey to see the wizard, wanting a brain, a heart, and courage in return. It's a great plot executed brilliantly. \n\nACTING:The performances in here were really good. Judy Garland played an innocent and iconic role as the young farm girl, Dorothy. Playing well off her and each other, Jack Haley, Ray Bolger, and Bert Lahr performed excellent, iconic roles as the Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman, and Cowardly Lion. I favored Bert Lahr out of the trio, for his performance doubled comedically as it did iconically. Margaret Hamilton also played a great part as the Wicked Witch of the West. She still seems menacing today. The other shiners would be Clara Blandick as Aunt Em, Charles Grapewin as Uncle Henry, Billie Burke as Glinda the Good Witch, Frank Morgan as The Wizard of Oz, and all of the munchkins. There really wasn't a bad performance in here. \n\nSCORE:The musical score and soundtrack for this film are iconic, memorable, and catchy to sing as well as to hear. Everybody knows a song from it, whether it's \"We're Off to See the Wizard\", \"Ding-Dong the Witch is Dead\", or even \"If I Only Had a Brain.\" Everybody knows the catchy soundtrack to this film. \n\nEFFECTS:The effects were astounding back in their time and are still very colorful today. The best effect at the time would have to have been the dramatic and iconic change from sepia/grayscale to Technicolor. That was a dazzling change for people back then and is still a prominent mark in film history. The prop effects were pretty colorful, and the more digital effects (such as the fireballs and the bubbles) were pretty interesting. The effects overall back then were pretty top-notch, but they still stand as interesting to watch now. \n\nOTHER CONTENT:This film is iconic on so many levels. Everybody has either seen or heard of the Wizard of Oz, and it's a family favorite for the young children and the older adults. Comparing it to the original book, the film seems to be based only loosely on it. However, this film adaptation improved it from its book form. Everything about this film is really perfect for its time and loveable even today. \n\nOVERALL,an epic film with a brilliant plot, really good performances, catchy score and soundtrack, colorful effects, and an iconic legacy left for filmgoers everywhere.",

No recaps here because the story is so well known. The film itself was really innovative with effects that couldn't be accomplished in 1939 without computers (like when Glinda first appears, she appears as a bubble & then dissolves). But by far the most innovative thing was the switch from Black & White to Color. The characters are perfect & The Lion, by far, remains my favorite with his lines & the way he acts all brave & then switches from brave to scared crapless at several points which makes for some good laughs. The songs are catchy & my favorite one is \"Ding Dong, The Witch Is Dead\" (which I'm currently listening to as I type this). When I see Oz next week, I'll slip in a review for that one as well. For this one, not for the skirmish but still a good film over all. It defines the term \"Classic\" & trust me, it is sjfh",
