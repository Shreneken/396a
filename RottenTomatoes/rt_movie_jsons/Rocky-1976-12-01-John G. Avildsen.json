While training with feisty former bantamweight contender Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith), Rocky tentatively begins a relationship with Adrian (Talia Shire), the wallflower sister of his meat-packer pal Paulie (Burt Young).",

They all deliver the unique personality of each one well to tie the story well, but I was a little disappointed with the final fight that lasts a few minutes and with many cuts, making the fight lose the potential that the script developed throughout the plot.",

            "content": "\"Rocky,\" directed by John G. Avildsen and written by and starring Sylvester Stallone, is an American sports drama film released in 1976. The film follows the story of Rocky Balboa, a down-on-his-luck boxer from Philadelphia, who is given the opportunity of a lifetime to fight the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed.\n\nThe movie's main strength is its captivating story and well-written characters, particularly Rocky. Stallone's portrayal of Rocky is nothing short of brilliant, and his performance earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Rocky is a complex character who is both tough and vulnerable, and audiences cannot help but root for him as he struggles to make something of himself in the world of boxing.\n\nThe supporting cast also gives outstanding performances, with Talia Shire as Adrian, Rocky's love interest, and Burgess Meredith as Mickey, Rocky's gruff but caring trainer, standing out in particular. The chemistry between Rocky and Adrian is sweet and genuine, and their love story is an integral part of the film's emotional impact.\n\nThe film's cinematography and editing are also noteworthy. The iconic training montage sequence set to Bill Conti's stirring \"Gonna Fly Now\" theme is an indelible part of cinematic history, and the fight scenes are filmed with intensity and realism that are a testament to the filmmakers' dedication to accuracy.\n\nOverall, \"Rocky\" is a timeless classic that stands the test of time. It's a movie that is not just about boxing, but about the human spirit and the ability to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. It's a movie that will inspire and move viewers, and its impact on pop culture cannot be overstated.",

Stallone's portrayal of Rocky is simply outstanding, and he brings a depth and vulnerability to the character that makes him so relatable and endearing. From his awkward attempts at wooing Adrian to his heart-wrenching conversations with his coach Mickey, Stallone's performance is nothing short of incredible.\n\nThe supporting cast is also impressive, with Talia Shire giving a nuanced performance as Adrian, Rocky's shy love interest, and Burgess Meredith stealing the show as Mickey, Rocky's tough-talking coach. The chemistry between the characters is palpable, and their relationships are beautifully developed over the course of the film.\n\nThe boxing scenes are also expertly crafted, with Avildsen using close-ups and slow-motion shots to capture the raw emotion and intensity of the fights. The climactic bout between Rocky and Apollo Creed is a true masterpiece, with both actors giving it their all and making every punch count.\n\nOverall, \"Rocky\" is an inspiring and uplifting film that celebrates the human spirit and reminds us of the power of perseverance. It's a must-see for anyone who loves sports films, character-driven dramas, or just great cinema in general.",

Rocky is successfully introduced to the audience as  a character we sympathise with. This being Sylvester Stallone's first big film, his acting is excusable, however I feel that the lack of acting skill adds to the character of Rocky, his awkward delivery of lines and lack of confidence adds to the character and makes it more realistic. The storyline, while extremely unlikely is still probable is is not an absurd series of events like the story's of the cinema today.\n\nOne of my biggest highlights of the film is the ending. It was somewhat unpredictable and in my opinion one of the best endings in the whole franchise. \n\n\"Rocky\" provides some of the most iconic scenes in cinema history as well as one of the most recognisable soundtracks of all time.",

But after about twenty minutes, the movie really gets into its groove and had me locked in till the end. My favorite aspect of this film is the humanity it has; it takes a look at a big and intimidating fighter in Rocky and explores his emotions and insecurities. My favorite scene is when he lays in bed next to Adrian with the sudden realization that he cannot win this fight. It was an incredibly vulnerable moment for him and worked really well.\n\nAs I said before, the dialogue is very inconsistent, especially in the scene at Rocky's house with Adrian. It was very unsettling to watch because she is written as if she does not want to be there, but then the next second she is in love with him. It was very weird and creepy. On the other hand, in some scenes, the dialogue is written very well, which lends itself to boosting the actors' performances. But when it is off, the acting on display is negatively affected. Despite that, this movie gets a lot more right than it does wrong in the script department.\n\nTechnically, this film excels. The score is fantastic, with one of the most iconic songs in cinematic history. The cinematography is top-notch, with some incredible shots in the city and very creative angles used during the training sequences. \n\nOverall, this film lived up to every ounce of hype it had behind it, and I thoroughly enjoyed every second spent with these characters.\n\nScore: 98%\nVerdict: Masterpiece",

You've got Bad News Bears, North Dallas Forty, Brian's Song, the Longest Yard, Bang the Drum Slowly, Breaking Away; The Greatest; Fat City, Le Mans, Pumping Iron; and then the list goes on....   Those just aren't some of the best sports movies ever made; those are some of the best movies made, period!  Topping that list was Rocky.  A gritty; new-wave; 70s ciname verite type movie; almost a documentary; about a part time hood; a loser from the streets of Philadelphia; Rocky Balboa; that no one likes;  who is handpicked from the publicity firm of Apollo Creed; the current reigning champion; (who is supposed to represent a cocky Mohammed Ali); to fight him in a big, hyped up celebrity match.  And so the bulk of the movie feels like a Cinderella Story.  (The sports announcers even call it a Cinderella Story in the movie itself!). Rocky is lifted up from obscurity; and anointed by the press as the new David who will slay Goliath.  And David and Goliath stories aren't new for sports movies.  Heck Casey at the Bat was a similar David and Goliath, underdog-coming-from-behind type story; and it infact had a similarly shocking, downbeat ending; and that poem was written by Ernest Thayer in 1888!  So none of this is new.  But Stallone; (who refused to let anyone else star in Rocky; even after his buddy Henry Winkler had it optioned by ABC in 75); gives this story such intensity and veracity.  And the plot; where Rocky knows he's out of his league; but he's going to put it all on the line to go the distance.  He knows he's going to lose.  But he's going to stay alive for 15 rounds; and not get knocked out.  He'll do anything literally to go the distance.  Leading to the stunning ending where he's being pummeled and punished by Apollo, but, to everyone's surprise, he does not give up.  What a heartbreaking and inspiring ending! That's what sets this Rocky apart.  The goal is not to win; the goal is to never give up; very different from the other movies; it's got that epic; mythological Sisyphus pushing the Rock up the hill against all odds feeling! That paired with his iconic training scene; jogging through the streets of Philadelphia at the dawn; running up the stairway at the Philadelphia Museum of Art like a wild bull unleashed in Spain, as Bill Conti's thunderous sports anthem \"Gonna Fly Now\" booms viscerally in the background; and then turning; to the dawn; and the blazing sunrise; as he lifts his arms triumphantly in the air; this is a pure adrenaline rush few other movies can deliver!  Raging Bull might be more artfully made; and Million Dollar Baby might be more tragic; but Rocky has them all beat in terms of pure, raw inspiration.",

I could see how this could be viewed as a 'living the American dream' type watch, or perhaps moreso an 'underdog' tale. Its quite a solid watch. Given im not a particular fan of sports, especially boxing, I wasn't expecting a great deal of this but I reckon I enjoyed it more than I perhaps imagined I might because the majority of the film isn't set in the ring, as it were and instead it concentrated on Rocky's life outside the ring, his clearly low-ish standing and it shows how he did what he could to try and raise himself above that.\n\nIt is a bit cheesy but for the most part, its a reasonably solid watch and I respect that.

Sylvester Stallone does a great job in both acting in the title role and writing the script, and the supporting cast is also excellent. The score is one of the best in cinema history, especially when played behind the ionic Rocky training sequence. Rocky also has tons of iconic imagery and diolague, too. And the final fight is also thrilling, even if it has a somewhat predictable ending.  There are some issues, though. There are only two boxing fights in the whole movie, the very beginning and very end. And the rest of the movie, though it has some fun moments, feels slow and dragged-on at times.

De lo mejor de la pel\u00edcula es el final, todo el contexto es muy tenso y esta muy bien hecho, y finalmente a pesar de como termina te deja una sensaci\u00f3n satisfactoria. La historia est\u00e1 tan bien escrita y dirigida que te hace sentir como si estuviera basada en hechos reales. Esta pel\u00edcula te hace sentir una variedad de emociones que van desde la ira, la tristeza y los celos. La qu\u00edmica en pantalla entre Sylvester Stallone y Talia Shire es muy buena y real, no puedo imaginar a nadie m\u00e1s interpretando estos papeles mejor que ellos. Tambi\u00e9n, se destaca el soundtrack tan caracter\u00edstico de esta saga el cual le da el toque esencial a muchas escenas. Es una de esas pel\u00edculas que se te queda marcada mucho despu\u00e9s de que ha terminado. Recomendad\u00edsima.",

I may get hate for this but it's just my opinion and immediate reaction after finishing watching this.\n\nThe first hour of this is very slow and felt like an overly bloated introduction to the world and characters before the main plot had even begun. It could have benefited from being 20 to 30 minutes shorter. Rocky is the only character throughout who I could feel any sort of connection with, and even then I wasn't particularly compelled due to Stallone's unconvincing performance.\n\nThe only part of this film I can say I genuinely enjoyed was that training montage; now one of the most iconic moments in cinema. Problem is that it's about an hour and a half into the film, with little positives beforehand. Even the ending climactic fight which is one of the more enjoyable aspects of the film felt silly and overly melodramatic.\n\nI cannot really understand how this film is held in such high regard. I can see how people could enjoy enjoy this more than I have, but it is far from a great film. I found Raging Bull to be far superior in every regard.",

It seems every year a movie is released with a plot revolving around the tortured fighter who starts off on top, falls from grace, and then must overcome personal and professional struggles to regain his belt. Some of these films are even pretty good but none of them ever seem original or interesting and I think, being judged against Rocky, is why they usually come up short for me.\n\nThis was the first time watching in awhile and while I always love Mickey, I think I appreciated just how great this ending was more than any other viewing. I thought it was an excellent choice when the announcment of the decision of the bout is pushed completely into the background, and is barely even audible, as Rocky's confusion and anxiety to find his real prize, Adrian, is the main focus on screen. I don't think I've ever watched Rocky as more love story, than sports story, but on this viewing that proved interesting and new to me as I would argue that any of the success Rocky achieves in this film, or any future films, would have never been possible without finding that connection with Adrian. 8.5/10",

I bring this up because back then I never saw the movie Rocky despite knowing where the iconic scene with the steps came from. Now, having finally seen the film, I can honestly say Rocky is one of my favorite sports movies of all time. Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is an underdog Philly contender who's set up to fight Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). Meanwhile, he hits up a date with shy pet shop owner Adrian (Talia Shire) and hires an old grouchy boxing manager Mickey (Burgess Meredith) to help him warm up for the Bicentennial Super Battle. What I loved so much about the movie, aside from Rocky's likable sweet-hearted persona, is that the majority of it centers on character interactions and relationships as well as the build-up to the boxing tournament. When it got to the match, I didn't expect Rocky to knock out Apollo first round nor Apollo winning the bout via split decision despite everyone, including Adrian, cheering for the Italian Stallion. That ending changes a whole new meaning in storytelling where the loser wins yet loses. Unfortunately, the sequels and the Creed films followed that conventional cliched ending where the protagonist wins the fight and loved ones. Maybe that's for the best because no matter how many sequels or spin-off movies get produced, we will always remember the first Rocky movie.\n\n(4 \u00bd Apollo Shorts out of 5)",

Sure, it's one of the most popular Cinderella stories of all time, but it's so good on its own right. The music, the cinematography, the casting, and direction are all top notch, and the screenplay\u2014written by Stallone in three days\u2014is one of the best of all time.

Talia Shire is the love interest, shes shy but Rocky and Adrian have a connection which is very sweet. There are drawn to each other, they both appear lonely and vulnerable. She becomes stronger throughout the movie. Rocky and Adrian's initial kissing scene is uncomfortable and then tender. The music is an anthem and very uplifting. There are elements of on the waterfront, he starts as a bum, there is work on the docks but in this case becomes the contender. Stallone plays Rocky with enough passion, drive and emotion to make me fully care about him. He has nothing to lose and feels very natural in his role. He sometimes over talks though and the film has some very random dialogue. Its an effective underdog story which entertains and is still the best of the series. You can see why people like the film but don't think it deserved Best Picture at the Oscars. Burt Young as Paulie at times just overacts and shouts and i like Burgess Meredith as Mickey who's loud spoken but in the end has Rocky's back.The moment as Mickey wants to help Rocky is one of the best scenes, Rocky talking about his prime and his house stinking and Mickey chatting about his boxing career. It says so much about both of them, its sincere and emotional. Carl Weathers is the arrogant and at times cliche champion who is more interested in the media. The running up the steps is a very iconic scene as the camera follows Rocky with Philadelphia as the backdrop. Rocky's training sequences as he runs through streets, by the water and by the docks with the music playing. The moment with Rocky at the empty arena is sentimental.   The boxing scenes are well staged, using camera angles to great effect. You can feel the punches. At times you feel the amount they get will cause damage or they shouldn't recover. An entertaining movie that's feel good.",

            "content": "Is Rocky the strangest film ever to win the Academy Award for Best Picture? As an underdog sports movie its Oscar appeal seems obvious, it remains highly acclaimed by many critics, and it was successful enough to both catapult its star to superstardom and to launch an entire movie franchise. But for all of this \u2013 and for all that its critics dismiss it as schmaltz \u2013 the most striking thing about the film is how odd it is.\nSylvester Stallone is often type-cast as an action hero due mostly to the subsequent Rambo franchise, a fact that he capitalised and poked fun at in The Expendables and its sequels. But at various times throughout his career he's proved that he can actually act and Rocky is the most prominent demonstration of this. Moreover, Rocky proved that he can also write: the script and Stallone's central performance are the two key factors that make the film as enjoyable as it is. It's interesting that in a story that is often predictable, it famously ends with Rocky failing to beat his opponent in the ring, but nevertheless gaining his respect and keeping his dignity. And of course, his real triumph at the end is when his girlfriend tells him that she loves him. \nBut it is the actual character of Rocky that is the film's most striking feature. Stallone is effortlessly convincing as the somewhat dim-witted amateur boxer who works as a debt-collector but is too soft-hearted to be really good at it. Rocky is not a typical hero, nor is he a typical anti-hero: he's brooding, socially awkward and quietly eccentric. This is at its most obvious when he starts chatting up Adrianna \"Adrian\" Pennino \u2013 he sounds alternately shy and just weird, enthusing about his two pet turtles and deeply proud that his nose has never been broken. Theirs is one of the strangest and yet most convincing movie romances ever filmed. Talia Shire's Adrian is no more a conventional romantic lead than Rocky is: she's shy to the point that one of Rocky's acquaintances cruelly describes her as \"retarded\". Rocky's clumsy pursuit of her shows how well matched they are \u2013 his own confidence is skin deep, as their scenes together demonstrate and there are few movie dating scenes as frankly bizarre as the ice rink sequence.\nIt is this quirky characterisation that makes both Rocky and Adrian so endearing. Stallone fits this role perfectly, giving a naturalistic performance that includes a whole spectrum of emotions, his tender scenes with Adrian contrasting with his later fury at trainer Mickey and his obvious nervousness as the fight with Apollo Creed approaches. Stallone the writer's other characters are all quirky in their own way, from Adrian's brother Paulie to confident and egotistical showman Creed, and he pens dialogue for them that often sounds like the sort of realistically inconsequential and irrelevant small talk that real people engage in. \nShire is as convincing as Adrian as Stallone is as Rocky, and strong support is provided by Carl Weathers as Creed and Burt Young as Paulie, although Burgess Meredith mostly just rasps a lot and looks grumpy as Mickey. During the climactic boxing match, Stallone and Creed both look genuinely battered and exhausted: it's a tribute to the acting and make-up, but nonetheless it isn't surprising that both incurred injuries whilst filming the scene. \nThe climactic fight is very well choreographed. Carl Weathers plays up to the camera perfectly as Apollo Creed. It looks convincing \u2013 it's no wonder that both actors sustained injuries \u2013 with the pair looking realistically sweaty and exhausted. John G. Avildsen rarely crops up on people's lists of their favourite directors and his career can be fairly accurately described as variable, but he does a solid job here and delivers some scenes that have become iconic, most notably Rocky's training montage with its equally iconic \"Gonna Fly Now\" theme. Indeed, the soundtrack is sparingly used, so when it is deployed it packs \u2013 if you'll pardon the pun \u2013 a real punch. Cinematographer James Crabe's camerawork helps, since his reliance on medium and long shots helps to give the film the look of a documentary which adds an air of realism and the use of the Steadicam benefits the picture enormously.\nI'm not sure that Rocky is a great film: it doesn't quite have the right mix of quality ingredients. But it's a lot less predictable than a summary of its plot might suggest, and a lot more interesting too. The credit for that is mostly due to the central performance and impressive script-writing of Sylvester Stallone and the overall result is a film that whilst not entirely deserving of its impressive reputation is nevertheless rather enjoyable.",

There are only two fights - one at the beginning and one at the end. In between, every screen moment is used to develop Rocky as a person. He is not traditional hero material - he's crude, stupid, boorish, and has limited aspirations. Nevertheless, there's something likable about the guy, and it has its root in the gentle, caring way he treats Adrian. And it's this relationship that's the key to making Rocky's ending triumphant. He may lose the fight, but he gains so much more. This is movie magic at its finest. ",

            "content": "This is a big, warm crowd-pleaser with a surprisingly charming lead character and a beautiful love story at the center of it's narrative. I had seen this twice in full previously and I've witnessed snippets of it several times whether on TV or at a recreation center but re-watching it I was able to appreciate just how good Talia Shire is as Adrian and yes, be inspired in a very clich\u00c3 (C) fashion. If you have a father born some time in the last 60 years then you will almost have definitely seen this film but even if you're a teenage girl with little to no interest in sports, like myself, it's still a very enjoyable film to watch.\n\nRocky Balboa, Sylvester Stallone, is an Italian-American man working in Philadelphia as a Mafia enforcer while chasing dreams of being a heavyweight boxer. His manager and trainer is Paulie Pennino who pushes him to make more public appearances and hype up his fights more. Rocky also romantically pursues Paulie's sister Adrian, Talia Shire, as he prepares to fight the fearsome Apollo Creed in a match that may or may not be fixed. Rocky begins to doubt himself as the fight approaches but encouragement from those around him cause him to believe in himself.\n\nThe most interesting part of the film was, to me, the love story as we see an unintelligent but sweet oaf fall in love with the shy, bookish young woman. Their first date, on which she ice skates around an empty rink whilst he runs along side her and tells her about boxing, contains better dialogue than you would expect from a sports film and the chemistry between Stallone and Shire is so great that this somewhat unbelievable love story feels genuine. Yes, their \u00e2~love' scene does seem a little non-consensual in today's #metoo era but I believe that Adrian does show consent and we see two people grow more comfortable with themselves in a healthy and loving relationship. Adrian does begin to dress more like a 1970s model towards the end of the film but Shire retains her sensible, motherly attitude in how she approaches the character and the final scene in which they embrace gets my tear ducts flowing.\n\nRocky's relationship to his community is another touch that makes this film special as the film makes an effort to display what makes Philadelphia special as a city. The iconic scene in which Rocky runs all the way up the steps to the town hall and throws his fists up in the air can still create a real rush of excitement in any viewer and as we see a wide shot overlooking Philadelphia we understand why Rocky is proud to be from this city. Seeing him punch meat on local television is funny but it also gives you the sense that people in this city really do care about the plight of this uneducated boxer because they can identify with him. The only other films I really associate with Philadelphia are those of M. Night Shyamalan and those quickly decreased in quality.\n\nStallone's central performance isn't what you would call great acting as he appears to be playing a semi-fictitious version of himself but he injects the character with a gentle giant persona that makes it hard not to root for him. All of the supporting players are great as we get a lot of unexpectedly sweet tough men and as previously mentioned Shire is worth the price of admission alone. The film is more than the sum of it's parts in this way in that most of the acting isn't on the level of Henry Fonda, the writing is pretty basic and the film doesn't look exceptional and yet it's a truly great film.\n\nThis is a film that can be watched at any time, in any place with or without company. It doesn't require a huge amount of engagement or analysis to be enjoyable and will probably tug at the heartstrings of even the most cynical audience member.\n\nConsidering this as a Best Picture winner however is more difficult as it was up against the hugely influential classics Taxi Driver (1976) and Network (1976) both of which wrestle with weightier themes and are widely considered two of the best films of the 1970s. I would have awarded Taxi Driver because it is a great film that's darker and more interesting than Rocky and rewarding Scorsese for one of his best films would mean that Gangs of New York (2002) didn't earn a Best Picture nomination.",

The film made me root for Rocky and made me feel that you can achieve your dreams, even as an underdog and fits into the dramatic genre that way. As professional work, I don't feel that there is anything that could or should have been done differently with the film. Somehow, I never knew that this film was written by Sylvester Stallone and enjoyed the story. I particularly liked the scene where Rocky and Adrian are on their first date. Rocky is trying so hard to make conversation with her and relate to her that he shows her his dislocated finger. I laughed out loud watching that scene! Directed by John G. Avildsen, I appreciated that he chose to use a lot of shots where the characters favor one side of frame. To me it clues us into moments of isolation that the character is experiencing. This is evident in the scene where Rocky and Paulie are arguing in the hallway over Rocky dating Adrian. Edited by Scott Conrad and Richard Haley, my favorite edit was when the scene was cutting between the interview with Rocky and following his training methods to Apollo watching Rocky's interview to men taking bets on rocky. It added so much to the story to have insight into each person's perspective on the match and see what's at stake. Acting-wise, I particularly enjoyed Talia Shire's performance as Adrian. My favorite scene of hers was when Rocky first comes to see her for dinner with Paulie. Adrian comes out of the kitchen, sees Rocky, and turns right back into the kitchen in one fluid motion. It immediately clues us into her feeling bashful without her having to say anything. In regard to cinematography, I enjoyed the scene where Rocky and Apollo have a TV interview. James Crabe captured the aesthetics of how interviews on TV looked then and it created a great contrast for the rest of the scenes in the film. One of my favorite examples of sound design was when Rocky and Adrian say good night to each other, and you can hear a train slowly getting closer to where they are in the background. The trains are a huge part of the city and that touch brings us as an audience even deeper into the story. Overall, I think the production value is of great quality considering the period that the film was shot in, as well as the minimal budget it was shot with. You can tell that the shots of Rocky running through the streets of Philadelphia were shot separately from the rest of the film (they were done guerilla style) as the production value isn't as high as the other shots. The guerrilla shots are much grittier.",

At a theater in Los Angeles, struggling actor Sylvester Stallone watched the Ali-Wepner fight and promptly went home and banged out the script for a little movie called \"Rocky.\". It wasn't based on a true story -- not directly. But it was inspired by and borrowed heavily from a true story.\n\nI do not know who done the boxing choreography in this, but who ever did, done a brilliant job. Sylvester Stallone done the boxing choreography in the third one, so I am not sure if he done the first. I got one problem with this movie and that is the romantic plot between Rocky and Adrian (played by Talia Shire). The problem with the romantic side of the film is that you focus more on what is happening with Rocky's love life, other than you worrying about Rocky training for his fight. Every single actor went there hardest into this film and gave the best performance out of the five in the franchise.\n\n The training sequence in the final is the most memorable training sequence in the entire Rocky franchises because all the others are basically copies of the first but with a twist. The final fight scene with Rocky and Creed was the only non predictable final fight in the saga because as this is the first and if there was a sequel confirmed at the time, you would think that he would win. That is what the final is jaw dropping excitement, which will always keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. \n\nSo overall Rocky is jaw dropping excitement. I would go as far as to call this a classic alongside (Jaws, Back to the Future, E. T, Jurassic Park etc.) But isn't as good as them. It is definitely the best one in the saga because it is a classic and the others tend to get same old, same old. \n\nGrade A+ Jaw Dropping",

I have somewhat of a bias on this one, but I don\u2019t necessarily think it will affect my review. Rocky is my girlfriend\u2019s favorite movie of all time and I\u2019ve had several conversations where I confess that I think the film\u2019s just... fine. However, I\u2019ve owned the whole series for a couple years now and I\u2019d never seen the other movies. So with Creed II coming out next week, I\u2019m gonna binge my way to the finish. So expect a lot more Rocky reviews soon. What made this experience different is instead of just watching the movie again, I listened to the commentary track by Sylvester Stallone. That is what made this film a great experience. Stallone explained the little things that I\u2019d never really considered. It\u2019s so obvious that he poured so much into this film. His indepth analysis is very engaging and really brings out the true character of Rocky and Adrian. I still think the cinematography is very well done (those steadicam shots are gorgeous) and the iconic shots at the Philadelphia Art Museum are still so magical. The sound design is very well done as well as the editing. The acting from Talia Shire is really great, Stallone is alright but his weakness is in the writing. Burt Young, who\u2019s character is annoying as hell, gives a solid performance and his subtle facial expressions explain everything he wants to say. Carl Weathers absolutely deserves a shout out for his work in the film. Despite his little screen time, his presence is felt throughout. My biggest issue is mainly the writing. Rocky\u2019s dialogue is so dumb and unintelligible. Like, I get that\u2019s his character but it\u2019s difficult to cheer for a creepy dumbass. I still find the scene in Rocky\u2019s apartment where he flirts with Adrien cringey and creepy as hell. He\u2019s dull and boring and the only reason I really liked him this time around was because Stallone explained his decisions and thoughts. Overall, I still don\u2019t really love Rocky. However, I definitely appreciate it a lot more, enough to give it a 4 star review (AKA a certified good movie in my book). Stallone\u2019s passion is eminent, even if the writing isn\u2019t always on point. The cinematography is fantastic and revolutionary, the fight scenes are electric and satisfying. I can\u2019t wait to watch the rets of the series. 8.0/10",

But the movie adds a simple twist, yet a very effective one, in the character's motivations.\n\nBut it didn't stop here, as the movie keeps raising the stakes by making an advantage of all the developments that have been given to all the characters.\n\nThe movie could have easily used the ups and downs of Rocky to evoke our feelings. Instead, the movie succeeded to be very moving by taking advantage of the very new twist that has been added to Balboa's motivations. The result is an underdog heroic character that is by no means clich\u00e9d. And Stallone shines in this movie and gave his best performance in his career. There are some moments when Rocky's confidence has been shaken a little bit and the hero starts to tell the message of the story and these moments somewhat worked, and they could have never worked without Sylvester Stallone's superb acting.\n\nI said that Rocky takes advantage of the developments of all its characters. Yes, all its characters!\n\nThe character of Adrian, for instance, has some realistic and genuine details that make the romance between her and Rocky works very well, although the relationship proceeds so fast. Talia Shire performance made Adrian even more realistic,unique and very compelling character.\n\nPaulie is another great character that made the movie even more poignant as it gave some depth for Rocky too.\n\nWhat I didn't like so much is Apollo Creed. In contrast to the rest of the characters, he is nothing but the stereotypical undefeated Champion. Also, all decisions he made exposed the movie's clich\u00e9d story. With that being said, his scenes are masterfully directed and he has a very catchy style.  \n\nThe final fight scene is maybe the most realistic fight scene has been shot at that time. And those who think it's not, please watch a boxing match and you'll find that boxing punches make sounds different from the comic book punches sounds that are still used in movies today.\n\n(9/10)",

            "content": "Rocky, a story of a poor boxer that doesn't have much gets a shot at the world heavyweight title against the world champion Apollo Creed. Rocky Balboa starts the movie working as a debt collector in run down Philadelphia, who's trying to make it big time in the boxing arena. Struggling to do so, his coaches, friends and employees fail to give him the time of day. When Apollo Creed, Heavyweight Champion of the World, comes to Rocky looking for a chance to turn a \"nobody\" into a \"somebody\". The match is suppose to be an easy fight for the champ, but the Rocky \"The Italian Stallion\" Balboa takes this fight as his only shot to make it big time, and gives Apollo a run for his money. This storyline is one reason that Rocky is considered one the the greatest movies on the 1970's and I believe that it is one of the greatest ever. This movie is an all time great because of the amazing storyline and the emotional connection you feel towards the characters, the incredibly small budget they had to produce this movie and all of the awards that Rocky has won.\n\tThe story of a poor man, who becomes rich and gets the the girl, might sound cliche but it feels far from it due of the emotional connection that pulls the audience in. In the review of rocky by Roger Ebert, a creditable critic, says the reason that this movie is great is because the audience feel connected (Ebert,1976). A movie with a good storyline and a bad connection with the audience is a bad movie, a movie that connects to the audience but has a bad storyline is also a bad movie, Rocky has an amazing storyline and the audience feels to be apart of the story. Roger Ebert also states that movies from the 70's lacked that emotional side, so rocky sort of came during a \"emotional drought\". The movie audience loved this movie when it came out because they felt something that the haven't felt in a while, a love for the characters. This emotional side of the movie helps put rocky on the all time great list because people remember how they felt watching this movie and the feel to be apart of the movie. \n\tRocky is one of the most successful movies of all time with a cumulative world wide gross of  over two-hundred twenty-five million dollars. To put that into perspective The Terminator, a movie made around the same time as rocky, and still considered a successful movie made forty million in sales. A reason that Rocky's two-hundred twenty-five million dollars in sales is so impressive is because of their budget on the movie. Rocky was produced with less than a million dollars. Terminator was produced with over six million dollars. The producers of Rocky had to take a mortgage on their homes to come up with money to produce this movie. Rocky also didn't have any really big and famous actors in the movie at the time, so because of that they didn't have to pay them too much money. Just like the movie, these actors were looking for their chance to make it big time and this movie was their chance to make it. They all put everything they had into this movie and it payed off. This movie proves that it doesn't need a lot of money to make a successful movie.\n\tRocky has won several awards and is one of the winningest movies of all time. It has won an Academy Award for Best Picture, Academy Award for Best Director, Academy Award for Best Film Editing, David di Donatello for Best Foreign Actor, Directors Guild of America for Outstanding Directing, and a Japan Academy Prize for Outstanding Foreign Language Film (IMDB,2018). This movie won are was nominated for most of the awards in 1977.  These awards back up the statement that Rocky is one of the greatest film ever created.\n\tMany people view this as just another fighting movie and that this one is just falls in line behind other great boxing movies. This movie is another boxing movie but it is responsible for the birth of the four other Rockys and the new boxing movie creed.\nIn conclusion in a time when not many great emotional attaching movies were out Rocky was produced. The movie didn't need a ton of money and amazing CGI effects to make it great. The movie has a great storyline and some actors and producers that want a shot at making it big time. It won several awards and was one of the best movies of the decade. But Rocky remains one of the greatest movies of all time because of the amazing storyline and the emotional connection you feel towards the characters, the incredibly small budget they had to produce this movie and all of the awards that Rocky has won.",

Rocky is a smart movie; which came off as a surprise to me, the whole movie is a build up to the much awaited fight giving the perfect value and gravitas to the event that it deserved but fails on living up to the expectation for the choreography is way too lose. John seems like an amateur when it comes to execute physical sequences but does a decent job for the rest of it maybe because he probably didn't have to do much since the writing is good enough to sail on its own and Sylvester is amazing on both the roles with a good enough supporting cast.

It concerns a 30 year old, two-bit club fighter from Philadelphia named Rocky Balboa, played brilliantly and with true conviction by Sylvester Stallone in a breakout performance that earned him a richly deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Rocky gets a supremely rare \"million-to-one shot\" for fame in a championship bout against the Heavyweight Champion of the World, Apollo Creed, played terrifically by Carl Weathers. It is Apollo who dreams up this publicity stunt to give a nobody a title shot during the bicentennial celebration of America. No one takes Rocky serious, but he trains hard with his old trainer Mickey Goldmill, played sensationally by the late great veteran character actor Burgess Meredith in memorable turn that earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Rocky will gain his self-respect and prove to everyone that he can go the distance. The lovely Talia Shire received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for her marvelous performance as Adrian, the painfully shy pet store worker who falls in love with Rocky, and Burt Young received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his superlative performance as Adrian's older brother Pauline who is a pain-in-the-ass drunkard. Skillful Academy Award winning direction by Avildsen, with a compelling Academy Award nominated original screenplay by Stallone, and an evocative Academy Award nominated score by Bill Conti. A triumphant film that is so inspiring and moving, it perfectly demonstrates the strength of the human spirit to overcome all odds. This low-budget cinematic gem became a surprise mega-hit box office sensation at the time of it's release and was followed by 5 sequels and a 2015 spin-off hit sequel \"Creed.\" Winner of 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture.

The film could be a bit less predictable (save Rocky not emerging victorious in the climatic fight against Apollo Creed, which was a bit left-field but not much when you consider Rocky stated several times over the course of the film he only wanted the distance with Creed.) but it shines in many other areas. For example the casting is spot on, most of the characters deliver a memorable and skillful performance (Especially Stallone) and the ones that don't usually aren't dwelled upon too much. The film's age shows and it may get a little boring for younger ones and those watching it today who might be used to cg heavy special effects extravaganzas but it can still be appreciated with the right mindset. the soundtrack is excellent though at times distracting and the drama and other interesting sequences are sometimes dragged down a bit by boredom stemming for earlier parts, but the script is great and acting superb so these complaints start to seem meaningless after further examination. This type of quality IS worth repeat viewings for some as said before is fine to watch just once to get a great cinematic experience and get the film's message. the boxing action and visuals might feel a little dated, but a remaster might take some of the film's charm. ROCKY is an amazing motion picture that you should definitely see. I'd give ROCKY a 9/10.",

            "content": "There's a moment in Rocky where Carl Weathers (evoking Muhammad Ali as the sharp tongued champ Apollo Creed), hatches a plan for his next main event fight in the absence of any high profile opponents. He'll fight an unknown, a random local contender, and it'll work. It'll work because, as Apollo says \"I'm sentimental, and a lot of other people in this country are just as sentimental.\" The scene plays like an admission from writer Stallone and director Avildsen. Rocky is here to prey on our sentimentalities. It's completely predictable, hopelessly clich\u00e9d and glaringly transparent in its schmaltzy coaxing of our sympathies. You'd be forgiven for thinking of Rocky as On the Waterfront's parallel universe, in which Terry was able to break away from his seedy world just long enough to become a contender. What Sylvester Stallone and John G. Avildsen offer us is by no means anything new, yet for all its missing subtleties, it's impossible to deny that Rocky works. \n\nWhy is this? It's because it speaks to a fantasy that's innate in all of us. It's a film which gives us the right moment, and the right characters, in which that story we all wish to lose ourselves in can be realised. How easy is it to place yourself in Rocky's shoes? How fun to release your cynicisms and live those childhood fancies if only for a short while? \n\nAnd we get the perfect  vicarious underdog in Stallone's title character. His is a fantastically charming performance. As well as Terry Malloy, there are also traces of Herman Munster in Stallone's benign but droopy features, and Rupert Pupkin in his clumsy talkativeness and lame humour. \n\nRocky would like to think of himself as an older brother to those dwelling in Philadelphia's chilled streets. He spouts his advice and tries to help, but we know he's really trying to convince himself he's something more than a two-bit debt collector working the docks. He thinks of himself as a bum, as do most people, and he fights nobodies for little money. Boxing is his real passion. \n\nIn other hands the plight of Rocky Balboa could have been an awfully ham-fisted one, but Stallone allows us to fall in love with his character. We want Rocky to succeed, to prove everyone wrong and realise his self worth; when we see Rocky raise his arms in fantasy atop of those famed stairs, there's little doubt as to how affected we've been by his story. \n\nRocky gets his chance to become something more when Creed selects him as the local contender who gets a shot. Rocky is gifted an opportunity to be \"somebody\" (as Brando would say) by stepping in the ring with the champion, but this isn't where the true drama lays. What's surprising about the film is how little of it is about boxing.\n\nMost impressive about Stallone's writing and Alvidsen's direction is how devoted they are to their characters, letting them materialise into much more than the mere archetypes they so easily could have been. It's the attention they pay to their characters that allows the championship fight to be so dramatic, to become something much more than a punch-up for a belt. \n\nTalia Shire plays Adrian, the love interest of Rocky, a painfully shy pet store clerk who he drops in on like clockwork to crack \"dad\" jokes and babble to. Their story is the true heart of Rocky, and it's one of genuine romance, the two finding a much needed appreciation for themselves in their affection for each other. Burt Young plays her belligerent, heavy drinking brother Paulie, a friend of Rocky's and a volatile schlub who's at once envious of Rock's new success, and latches to it like a determined leach. Burgess Meredith plays the trainer at Rocky's gym, the irritable, gravel voiced Mick who resents Rocky for never fulfilling his potential. He senses a chance for Rocky to finally redeem himself, but It's also an opportunity for his own underachieving self to find redemption. In the film's most downbeat moment, Mick grovels to Rocky, begging for the chance to train and manage him, despite so many years of browbeating. It's a harrowing moment of vulnerability, and the film is drip fed moments just like it, moments which bring our sympathies to life for the characters.\n\nRocky's transparency is a problem. It swings sentimentality around like a flail and it treads narrative ground that has been stomped to the crust, its obviousness in doing so always threatening to take us out of the moment. But Apollo's right. We are sentimental, we love being sentimental, and Rocky has enough passion and enough heart to make such sentimentality warranted. \n\nIf you enjoyed reading this, please head over https://filmfracas.wordpress.com for more.",

This is a movie that he wrote and starred in and showed his talent on both sides of the camera. It is a classic, but beautiful story about the hero who fails but still gets the girl in the end. Stallone plays the main character of Rocky Balboa and he shows all of his talents this time around. He proves that he is someone who is to be taken serious by the audience. The supporting cast, which includes stars like Talia Shire, Carl Weathers and Burgess Meredith helps the story forward and helps give our main guy a good sense of accomplishment in the end. Oh, and a lot of challenges! The twist to the classic love-rival story, ended up being one of the most successful accomplishments of all time. Who would have known...??",

The boxing is a big part of it, but we don't even get to the real meat of that story until about an hour in. And without even realizing it, we're getting a whole lot of character depth during the first half of the film. \n\nForget the creepy way that Rocky forces Adrian to give him that first kiss. The story as a whole is sweet. She's a true diamond in the rough. It's almost not even believable at first, but the two have so much chemistry that it works. \n\nBut like most of the movie, their relationship is without much conflict. Rocky doesn't overcome any crazy obstacles. He's a lazy boxer who hasn't made anything of his life, and when some freak opportunity presents itself, he finally works hard and gets what he wants. There isn't anything really standing in his way. Perhaps if they threw some conflict in there it may come off as contrived, but how it is now, it seems too easy. Maybe that's the point. I don't know.\n\nUndefeated heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) needs a new opponent for the title fight after his current one drops out. But he wants this new competitor to be a no name amateur, so that the public will get into the underdog story. \n\nAnd it's a good underdog story at that. You root for Rocky undeniably. But there could just be a little more in terms of a struggle. The biggest risk he takes is handed to him. And what does he have to lose, anyway?\n\nMuch of the film is dated with the fake punches and the already antiquated dialogue. There are points where the patter is so rhythmic that it sounds like it's from the '40s or '50s. It's a slow moving film, and some scenes just drag on for way too long. It helps add to the character development, but it does a number on our attention span. \n\nThen there's predictability. The end result is telegraphed from a mile away. We can guess what's going to happen for most of the film. And we are usually proven right--another side effect of there not being any unexpected drama. \n\nNowadays, we have a quixotical view of Rocky, the all-American hero. Even the Academy was lost in its gaze with this film winning Best Picture back in 1977. But sadly, it's not as good as we want it to be. But that's not to say it's not good. It's still a cool underdog story, albeit not paying off as well as its predictability wants it to. However, corniness aside, this film set the pace for countless stories that came after it. And most of all, it has a lot of heart. You can't knock it for that.  \n\nTwizard Rating: 74",

            "content": "Arguably the greatest sports movie of all time.  So this is about a small time boxer named Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone).  He doesn't have a whole lot going on for him, but he gets by.  One day, the chance to fight the heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), falls in his lap, and he must start training immediately for this momentous occasion.  I went a very long time without watching this movie.  Not because I had any bias against it, it was just a film that I never took the time to sit down and watch.  As far as popularity goes, I do think this was my biggest blind spot in film, and people have given me a hard time on a number of different occasions for not having seen this.  With the release of Creed, I couldn't think of a better time to rectify this, and what do you know, it really is the greatest boxing movie ever made.  I don't usually go for boxing movies and that is entirely because so many of them follow the same exact template.  With movies like Southpaw or The Fighter, you know exactly what you're going to get, which is a story that goes a little something like this: an unlikely protagonist rises up and overcomes struggles and hardship to bring their personal life around through their sport and craft.  There, I just described almost every film in an entire genre.  The thing is that they all got it from Rocky, as it is the original and still remains the best.  Not even just boxing movies lift from Rocky, sport movies in general do; we wouldn't have one of my favorite films in The Wrestler if we didn't have Rocky.  I love less-than-intelligent protagonists when they are earnest, and this has one of the best examples out there; you can see all of the emotions right there on his sleeve, and Stallone play it masterfully.  The training montage to this is amazing; I've seen it by itself on its own, but in the actual context of the film, it is even better.  That music is like no other, and when the brass section starts playing, it is like instant energy flows into your body as soon as you hear it.  It is more than just a boxing movie, and the thought did cross my mind: for a boxing movie, there's really not all that much boxing.  You have a fight at the beginning and the climactic fight at the end, and that's really about it.  The middle is almost entirely drama and training, and that is the meat of the story.  You get a great feel of all of the characters so you can really rally behind them and root for them, and you also get a really good feel of Philadelphia as a city.  I am still of the mindset that once you've seen one boxing movie, you've seen them all, but this is the one that did it best.",

            "content": "Predictable in the fact that filmgoers will always root for the underdog if they love that underdog, Rocky stands heads and shoulders above all of the boxing tales that try replicating its singular charm...including, ironically, its own sequels. Remarkable not for its originality but for making a Capra-esque human drama that inspires rather patronizes, Rocky isn't the first underdog sports story but it does define the genre from here on-in. Indeed, if it had premiered 30 years earlier, this film very well might have been titled It's a Wonderful Life, You Bum.\n\nIn this PG-rated sports drama, a small-time Philadelphia boxer (Stallone) gets a supremely rare chance to fight the heavy-weight champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), in a bout in which he strives to go the distance for his self-respect. \n\nSylvester Stallone's script and performance, ahem, punch up pure character out of a caricature and provide a heart-warming tale that impossibly sports a blue collar Can-Do human spirit that seems unbeatable, even in a very cynical age. Arriving in a decade populated with hard-edged terminally pessimistic dramas such as The French Connection, Serpico, Network, All the President's Men, Taxi Driver, and Apocalypse Now!, Rocky's optimism in presenting the simple unshakable drive of an everyman's champion makes it an underdog of a different sort. The fact that it won the Oscar for Best Picture and became a blockbuster stands testament to the fact that filmgoers responded to it even if the material stands a slight step below quality-wise. Still, director John G. Avildsen's guiding hand gives film history one of the most indelible scenes of all time when our challenger reminds us what's more important than winning by screaming out to find his true love amid the maddening crowd: \"Adrian!!!\" \n\nBottom line: Right Hook of God",

Rocky is a simple guy that we can all relate to, and his pursuit of self-respect is a universal experience that even the Academy could not deny. Stallone turned down many lucrative offers insisting that he and only he could play Rocky. He was right. This epic film is an underdog that became an undeniable winner, just like Rocky himself.",

It's one of those rarities that always leaves me genuinely feeling something when it's over, no matter how many times I see it. I saw Rocky for the first time when I was around seven years old. Surprisingly, I wasn't bored. Even then, I knew it was something special. I grew up with these films and there was just something about them that just had so much heart, especially the first one. Sylvester Stallone wrote this screenplay in just three days which is pretty amazing. He wanted desperately to play the title character and fought for it. Thankfully, he did and if he didn't, not only would the movie not be the same but it would not have been nearly as successful, let alone forerun six sequels. Stallone as Rocky Balboa is one of the most special portrayals in cinematic history. Throughout the movies, he creates such a character that makes me feel like I know him. From the way all the characters are written, you feel like you get to know them. What helps is that the whole cast really do become their characters. Even though \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Network\" are probably more talked about in film classes, \"Rocky\" absolutely deserved to win Best Picture in 1977. It also has such an excellent message. It's not necessarily about winning, it's about going the distance with the best. If Rocky could go the distance, he feels like he's already won in a way and he is better than what people think of him.",

It's takes a long time to get going, has a very sluggish pace and is very often bogged down by scenes of wallowing in pity and self-doubt. These are very familiar to anyone who's seen a modern sports bio, and back then they obviously weren't as well-worn as they are now, but the entire film still comes off as entirely predictable. Rocky is the stereotypical underdog, he's going to struggle, he's going to have people doubt him and tell him he'll ever make it, he's going to get angry and alienate those close to him but in the end he's going to win everyone's respect.  I do like the twist at the end, but aside from that the whole film is by-the-numbers. Rocky starts out a very likable character, full of pep and always cracking jokes despite his destitution, but after a while he becomes the typical downbeat, I'll-never-make-it-so-why-should-I-even-try guy, and it sucks the life out of what could have been a much more entertaining film.",

It's a very good movie, has the feel for the time, good acting and performances, and unlike most other movies of the subject, doesn't just focus on the training.  He's trying to make a life, get a girl, start a family, and help his friends and town.  He's a great character and is fun to watch, even if he seems a bit emotionless.  The training is tough and well shown as well in it's own glory, but it's outside the gym dealing with his best friend and girlfriend that the movie does it's best.  It's awkward at times when it should be, and using emotion right.  The final fight we have all been waiting for is great too, well shot, and entertaining.  It doesn't offer the underdog beats all ending we all excepted but to my surprise and joy the champion stayed the champ and Rocky was proud to have given him his best fight and the chance for the title.  Of course if spawned many more sequels, which although get repedative and eventually stop offering much difference, it's a great series to watch.  Having Stallone show up for Grudge Match recently was completely influenced by this movie, and gives off a couple of references. But it is more humor based and although a good film is not at all what this is.  Classic for many years to come and one of Stallone's best",

So near the end of the Movie he trains with a great song Gonna fly now and run the Philadelphia Art Museum steps and rises his arms. Then Rocky says all he wants is to go the distance with Creed because he knows he can't win.

However, when heavyweight champion Apollo Creed pulls his name out of a hat and offers to fight him in a showcase event, Rocky finds himself pushing further than he ever had before, while dating his best friend's sister.\n\nSylvester Stallone, who also wrote the screenplay, stars in the title role, in what would become his breakout performance in Hollywood. Alongside him are Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers and Burgess Meredith, all putting in solid performances - particularly Weathers as the flamboyant and arrogant Apollo Creed.\n\nDespite the surprise ending, this film is ultimately an uplifting feel-good movie - something modern boxing/fighting films seem to lack in their dark and gritty tones. The comedy in this film is primitive in nature, but wonderfully executed anyway, and the relationships and characters are suitably fleshed out.\n\nThis is a classic film, and remains strong to this day.

Movies about underdog athletes don't usually resonate with Oscar voters.  But watching Rocky this time around I realized something - this isn't a sports movie.  This is a movie about a self proclaimed 'nobody' finding love.  Rocky before it is anything else is a love story.  Sure there is the boxing, Apollo Creed, the emotional music and Mickey the trainer all of the stuff that makes for a good sports movie.  But this movie is about Rocky and Adrienne - two of the least likely lovers in all of Hollywood.  And that's what makes this movie Oscar worthy.  There are nuances in this movie that you just don't always see in other places.  For example when Mickey offers to manage Rocky.  Mickey is desperate to bring meaning to his own life, Rocky is angry that he's been overlooked for so many years; angry that Mickey only wants to be a part of his life now that he's fighting a big fight.  But there's that moment of quiet reconciliation when Rocky chases Mickey into the street - a reconciliation between two 'nobodies.'  I loved that scene and that's why its hard not to love Rocky.  He gives voice to the \"nobody\" in all of us - and reminds us that we are indeed a somebody.",

I am talking about the beloved classic: \"Rocky\".\nThe year is 1975; heavyweight champion Apollo Creed is preparing to defend his title in the world heavyweight championship in Philadelphia, but his opponent drops out because of an injury. With no professional boxer willing to accept because of the short time they would have for training, Apollo decides to give a local underdog a shot at the title. Based only in his nickname \"The Italian Stallion\", Apollo chooses the unknown boxer Rocky Balboa.\nThe first installment of the franchise is not what you would expect from a Rocky film nowadays, (lots of training montages and a long but well choreographed boxing match at the end resulting in a victory for Rocky) I even argue that this is not a sport film, this is well executed and engaging drama. It has a well told and relatable story; a variety of characters that you care for, acting that is pretty good with Sylvester Stallone giving the best performance of his career, a theme that still has the same power than in 1976, a memorable score, an iconic ending, great directing and the most important; it has a lot of heart that will get some sentiments out of you. This is not a sport film that is all about the underdog winning the match; it's deeper and smarter than that, it talks about the big opportunities that you get in life and that alone makes you care about the path that Rocky will take. It is not a masterpiece but still is one of the greatest films of the 70s. My big complain is that there are not enough of certain characters and they deserved to have more screen time.\nOf course it has people saying that it is overrated, but it really isn't. If you enjoy sport films, you need to be warned that this is drama. Undeniably the best of the franchise and arguably the best \"sport\" film ever made.",

The character of Mickey to me was an okay character, but only when he walked away sadly from Rocky's apartment. Mickey was always yelling against Rocky, but when he was going to get fame he started to act nice so he looked like he wanted to use Rocky to get back into the spotlight. So I thought Mickey was unlikeable too. The story ofcourse is a predictable underdog story, so that did work against the movie.

            "content": "PART OF MY CLASSIC VIEWINGS OF 2014 LIST\n\n\"Yo Adrian! It's me Rocky!\"\n\nCall me crazy, but prior to typing this review, I have never seen this icon of a movie called Rocky. It's ironic cause it's one of my dad's all-time favorite movies. Was it my not-so fond interest in classic films at the time or I was too busy watching stuff that I despise nowadays like Thomas and the Magic Railroad, I don't know, but after my sudden interest in older films, Rocky has been a film I've been wanting to watch for quite some time. Ever since its release in 1976, time has been really kind to this movie; it made Sylvester Stallone a breakout star, earned the Oscar for Best Picture, notoriously beating Taxi Driver (and forever making Scorsese fans really angry), spawned 5 sequels, and has become a cultural icon. Films that feature this kind of acclaim in the business either tend to actually be worth the acclaim or be overhyped, such as that overrated Citizen Kane. As for Rocky, it is definitely worth it's acclaim, it definitely deserves it's title for Best Picture, even if I hadn't seen Taxi Driver, and makes me proud that I finally went into older films that have defined what Hollywood is today.\n\nMeet Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), an amateur boxer in Philadelphia who has a reputation for his extreme toughness. At the same time, he develops a crush on Adrian (Talia Shire), a shy girl who works in the local pet store. Rocky gets his shot at fighting in the big leagues when he's offered to compete in the ring against boxing champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), who strongly believes in the American Dream and wants underdog fighters a chance to make it like he has. To prove that he can fight in the ring with someone like Apollo, Rocky has to train at his hardest, such as gaining more support like getting a manager (Burgess Meredith) and impressing the girl he loves.\n\nRocky also stars Burt Young as Adrian's meat-packing brother Paulie who gives Rocky the raw meat to train with.\n\nThe film Rocky was born after Sylvester Stallone watched a boxing match featuring Muhammad Ali and an underdog boxer named Chuck Wepner. Inspired by Wepner's strength in the ring, Stallone decided to write a movie about it featuring fictional characters that would soon become one of the most famous sports movies ever made. The film was directed by John G. Avildsen, who would later go on to direct another one of my favorite sports movies, The Karate Kid (which has been described as \"the teenage Rocky\" movie), and like The Karate Kid, Avildsen does a fantastic job at creating the real impact of what it's like in the arena.\n\nRocky was entirely filmed on location in Philadelphia, which was a very smart decision on the filmmakers part. The New Hollywood era, which specialized in making the films feel real, gritty, and authentic, was at its peak when Rocky was being made, so it was obvious that Rocky would get the same treatment. And what a great treatment it got indeed. From the opening shots of Rocky walking down the Phily streets, that rough and gritty atmosphere makes Rocky seem like it's a real movie. And real is the term to describe how excellent of a movie Rocky is. The characters seemed like real people, the finale boxing match is extremely realistic, and the whole story is just that feel-good American Dream story that makes me proud to live in a country that features those \"golden opportunities\" that has made America strong for the past 250 years. I loved every minute of this movie.\n\nWhen Sylvester Stallone wrote the story for Rocky, the studio did not want an unknown for the role. Actors in consideration for the part include actors like Robert Redford, Burt Reynolds, and James Caan. Stallone eventually convinced United Artists that he should play the role of Rocky, and what an excellent decision Stallone made. Roger Ebert once called Stallone \"the young Marlon Brando\" when reviewing this movie, and in a way, Rocky is like Brando's character in On the Waterfront, though while Terry Malloy regrets his decisions that me makes with that famous \"I coulda had class\" speech, Rocky puts on that realistic dream that everyone should have in life. No matter if he wins or loses, he knows that he will make it out strong in the end cause of his love for Adrian. And what a wonderful performance Sylvester Stallone makes in this film. He may have become a wild and obnoxious action star in modern times, but Stallone will always be remembered for the role of Rocky Balboa. As for the rest of the acting, like Stallone, they all have that realism that makes Rocky such an excellent movie. The best of which is Talia Shire as Adrian and Burgess Meredith as Mickey the manager.\n\nWho could not talk about a film like Rocky and not talk about its score? Bill Conti, who would be extremely well-known with this film, does an excellent job in the music he scores here. The beginning is nice and quiet, but as the film progresses, his music features sounds of triumph and cheer that fits in with the American Dream concept. Plus that theme song, \"Gonna Fly Now\", is one of the most awesome, feel-good songs ever written, used in the now-famous moment where Rocky succeeds in climbing up a lengthy set of stairs. What a wonderful little movie!\n\nIt took me years to finally watch Rocky, but it was definitely worth the wait. The underdog story has not been the same after Rocky, as it has been abused to death in sports movies today, some not being as effective (like that horrendous Real Steel, which basically is a robot rip-off of Rocky), but Rocky manages to tell that familiar underdog story and create a sports masterpiece with realism and grit that perfects the era of the 1970's.",

I mean, sure, it's the age old underdog story, making it predictable as Rotten Tomatoes consensus says, but I don't think it matters how groundbreaking it is. I say this simply because in our daily lives we wish to overcome challenges and if the story explores this then it can be made into a good movie. I mean as long as an underdog story is well executed and acted, then that suffices to make a good movie about overcoming obstacles put before us. That said, I can't deny it being a personal favorite.",

But this story is about hope and the simple idea that love can save even the most hapless of people.\n\nThis movie may not be for everybody. I can see how some viewing it today for the first time might find their opinion affected by knowing how silly the sequels were. Or perhaps your views of Sylvester Stallone (Rambo, conservative politics, etc) skew your opinion of Rocky. That's a shame, because you are missing out on a movie that is sweet without being saccharine, tough without being brutal, and uplifting without pandering. There is no storybook ending here; just a happy one.

Rocky is cheesy and a little old fashioned, but still a movie that gets you pumped up and excited. One of those movies you gotta see before you die.\nRocky Balboa is a loan shark who boxes as the \"Italian Stallion\" from time to time locally. He is challenged to a big patriotic fight by the reigning champ, Apollo Creed, because his name resembles Christopher Columbus, an Italian who founded our country. So he trains with his gruff elderly trainer Mick and his drunk friend Pauly hours and hours. This training session results in awesome background music. A big backstory in the movie as Rocky's relationship with Pauly's sister Adrian, which is a kind of awkward yet kinda sweet later on towards the end. I'm not spoiling the ending, either, I'll just say it's unexpected.\nRocky is exciting from beginning to end. It tells the story of a man who doesn't give up thick and thin. It's also not a big clich\u00e9 in the end where the main character ALWAYS wins. Stallone isn't the best actor in the world, but portrays Rocky in a way I like. He's good at times, bad at times. Carl Weathers is probably the most decent in the movie, he's got a fast talking arrogant black guy stereotype that's kinda entertaining. The movie has its tiny flaws, but still a great classic movie.",

Balboa is the posterboy for the underachieving, no-hoper, who emerges with his dignity intact and a girl in tow, because he sticks to his convictions and gives the champ a real fight. And the fact that he lost was very important, because it underlined the inherent tragedy in his life and offered a distinct counter-point to his successful relationship with Adrien.\"\n\nAnyone that thinks Rocky is about boxing doesn't understand film making at all.\n\nAdd to this the real-life story behind Rocky and it only gets more awesome. Sylvester Stallone wrote Rocky himself, for himself as the lead actor. He did this while being a waiter at the time and was offered a pretty good sum of money by a studio (hundreds of thousands of dollars) for the rights to make it but he turned them down because they would have cast someone else in the lead role and instead he got B-movie funding and made it on a budget himself and the rest is history.",

All the other things about things about this movie were good, the cinematography, acting, and script were all good. Overall, great movie.\n9/10",

It's a love story between two two underdogs, who find each other and find  that they bring out the best in each other. so happens that one of them is a boxer and given a opportunity that only happens once in a million lifetimes. Out of all the rocky movies the first is certain the best of the series, it has the most heart, and makes you root for the two underdogs.",

One day, undefeated heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed is planned to face another boxer on New Year Eve, but Green drops out due to an injury, so Creed decides to give a local underdog a shot at fighting him. And because he likes Rocky's is nickname \"The Italian Stallion,\" he decides to select him for the fight. So Rocky has to train to fight Creed while the film also focuses on how he develops an interest in his friend, Paulie's shy sister, Adrian.\r\n\r\nTo me, this was a nice movie...but it was not great. The story was nice and the you are left caring for some of the characters - mostly Adrian with her relationship with Rocky and of coarse Rocky himself with how he doesn't give up and how deep down he does mean well and is a caring guy. And the fight was well done and did leave me wanting to know how it ends. But I honestly find most of the movie just...boring. I mean I'm all for a good amount of dialogue packed scenes to develop the characters and all, but I honestly think they over did it a lot. I think a lot of scenes were better off with little to no dialogue because it seemed like most of what anybody did was just talk.\r\n\r\nAnd that's my review for Rocky. It's a little boring due to how they had a little too much dialogue scenes, but otherwise, it's a nice story with characters to care about and a finale that was fairly suspenseful that altogether makes this just an okay movie to me.",

Even though the PG rating is a bit strange for the type of movie it is coming out in the mid-seventies (many were R rated), the acting is still quite good from Stallone and his co-stars Burt Young and \"Godfather\" alum Talia Shire (F.F. Coppola's sister).  The sequels fared pretty well, too, I think, but then again, that's in recognition of the fact that, pardon the pun, you can only \"go the distance\" with this character so many times before you start really stretching credibility.  I think Stallone knew this when he made and released what was clearly the FINAL Rocky film back in 2006. Definitely worth the label of \"classic,\" though, and the second is actually a bit heartwrenching in places whereas you wouldn't really expect them to have gone in that direction after the first's success.",

Rocky Balboa is a mediocre boxer who has no real chance of becoming anything. However he is spotted by a world champion boxer Apollo Creed who wishes to face Rocky as a publicity stunt. Here Rocky finally has the chance to prove himself and become something. In some iconic scenes he trains in his buddy's meat freezer with the famous theme playing in the background. When the day of the fight comes it is evident that Rocky is no fluke and he may even have a chance to win. What makes this movie so touching is Rocky's humble beginnings and his lovable personality. He may be slow but you want him to succeed because he is so kindhearted. This movie was so popular that it led to many sequels but nothing quite beats the original. Yo Adrian!",

The film was written by Sylvester Stallone when he was going through a tough time. He took a few real events from his life, and added them into this movie. His character, Rocky Balboa, is a very humble and fun person and without his personality being the way it is, the movie wouldn't have been as good. He is developed very well and so are the supporting characters. Burt Young plays Paulie, a friend of Rocky's. Burgess Meredith plays Mickey, the owner of the gym Rocky fights and trains at. Mickey is one of the greatest characters ever put into film, he's hilarious but also very good hearted and smart. Talia Shire plays Adrian, Paulie's shy sister that works at a pet shop. Rocky and Adrians relationship is very well done, and the reason why is because despite her being the way she is, Rocky see's the beauty in her, and he allows her to be herself and you as the audience really start to feel for her character throughout the movie. Carl Weathers play Apollo Creed, who wants to challenge an underdog in the ring, he picks Rocky because of his nickname, The Italian Stallion. The story is rather predictable, but it doesn't stop the movie from being a masterpiece. The fight is great, the ending is satisfying, the acting is amazing, and the movie as a whole is definitely worth watching.",

I have always felt like Stallone is a heck of a lot smarter than he gets credit for (he wrote the script after all), and his smartest move of all may have been capitalizing on his slow-speaking persona by translating it to the screen and creating one of the most likeable, heroic characters in film history.  The film is brilliantly cast with actors who come across as average joes trying to make ends meet.  Carl Weathers (one of my favorite 80's stars) is the perfect antithesis to the Rocky character as smooth-talking heavyweight champ Apollo Creed.  His rivalry with Rocky is perfectly laid out, leading to an epic battle in the ring.",

The fact that Stallone really did train like a boxer for the role and became something of an expert on the pugilistic art only adds to the realism. The storyline is fairly simlistic, underdog overcoming all the odds to triumph stuff, and the sub-plot lovestory sits slightly incongruously within the picture, but overall it's good watchable entertainment, even for the non sports fans.",

Where films on the other side of the globe were already working on incorporating believable drama into their thrilling action (Asian martial arts movies, for one), here we're stuck with two hours of a camera aimlessly following around a lonely, unproductive chum who could probably have neanderthal impersonations as his stunt double. Oh, but the action is so real, man. It makes clashing action figures placed behind a cut-out soap box television screen a thing of the past, man. Plus, that guy up there feels my underdog pain and conveniently offers some hope with its priceless inspirational undercurrent. Indeed to the latter, but nah, man, the low budget is plainly visible, and worse it's used as a justification for careless and inconsiderate filming mechanisms, perhaps the reason why sports films as we know them are horribly subjective and unappealing most of the time. You're better off with the upped energy in actual boxing footage, something I never before pictured myself recommending.",

Well, it's tied with the Lord of the Rings...and if you forced me to choose, I would stick with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but, that doesn't stop me from calling this my favorite anyway. There's something magical about it that I can't explain....but, since you're reading this review, you'll realize that I tried explaining anyway!\n\nEveryone knows the story by now...or they think they do...judging by the ratings people have given this film, I seriously doubt they've watched this movie recently. Chances are they're basing their opinions off the 'meh' Rocky 3 and the complete jokes that were 4 and 5. Revisiting this film time and time again, I am always struck by how different this film was from its ridiculous sequels (2 and 6 being the exceptions). The original Rocky is quiet and subtle, keeping its focus on the inspiring story and, more importantly, the wonderful characters. The setting is dark and dirty. It's a far cry from what many people associate with Rocky, and it'll probably throw off those who are expecting mindless entertainment as in the third and fourth films. That aside, there's just no denying the power of the original.\n\nSylvester Stallone cemented himself as one of the greatest actors of all time, giving one of the finest performances ever seen on film. It's a shame what happened to his career, but at least he got to prove himself once more with the final Rocky film. His writing is flawless as well. He gives every character a moment to shine and he never sinks to over the top sentimentality as he would in later films.\n\nTalia Shire is absolutely stunning as Adrian...she says so much in just facial expressions, and you nearly forget that she doesn't have much dialogue for a good portion of the film's running time. \n\nBurt Young's performance as Paulie is another remarkable thing. Here is a guy you should hate, but you somehow can't. Thanks to the writing and the powerful acting of Young, Paulie is incredibly sympathetic.\n\nCarl Weathers, in his big acting debut, is a complete natural. He embodies Apollo Creed in all his glory. Arrogant, fast-talking, good-natured...there's no way you can call this guy an antagonist. He's too likable.\n\nFinally, there's the character of Mickey, played to perfection by the late Burgess Meredith. Both he and Stallone were nominated for acting Oscars and neither of them won. This is an absolute disgrace. Burgess' performance is iconic and has gone down in history as such. The scene in which he attempts to convince Rocky to let him be his manager is one of the finest on celluloid and that one alone proves that they both deserved Oscars.\n\nAll these performances, the script, and the brilliant, pitch-perfect directing from John G. Avildsen make the movie work, but there's one final element that really cements this as one of the greats. The score. Bill Conti's beautiful piano plays the solemn version of the Rocky theme, reminding us of the hardships these characters are going through. When the theme finally erupts in all its glory during the training montage, it takes every ounce of effort to keep yourself from cheering outloud and upsetting the neighbors. It simply is remarkable.\n\nRocky was the little movie that could. Made for a shoestring budget (reportedly under $1 million), this film went on to become one of the highest grossing of all time and spawned all the mediocre sequels that turned the character and Stallone into a joke (once again, may I remind you that I disclude the second and sixth because I thought they were both great). It was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Acting nods for Stallone, Shire, Meredith, and Young, Original Screenplay, Original Song, and Sound. It won Best Picture, Best Directing, and Best Editing. It also earned its place on the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 movies of all time (#57). This film is a timeless classic about one man's journey to prove to the world and, more importantly, himself that he can go the distance. All the elements combine perfectly to make this one of the best of all time. Stop pretending you've seen this movie if you've only seen the later ones. You have no idea what you're missing.",

            "content": "Rocky is the quintessential underdog movie that has stood the test of time thanks to its great script, iconic music, and fantastic acting from Stallone and company. The classic story about a down-on-his-luck boxer who gets a shot at the big-time is semi-autobiographical of Stallone's struggles in Hollywood and how he refused to sell his script unless he could play Rocky, becoming a self-made movie star! His acting as a stereotypical, Italian bruiser-type is a little grating at first, but he slips comfortably into the role and you definitely root for him as the film goes on. The supporting cast is exceptional with great work from Burgess Meredith, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and of course: Carl Weathers as Rocky's opponent, Apollo Creed! Rocky's humble beginnings as an enforcer for a mobster was something I didn't expect and it adds a great level of drama to the character as he's struggling to become a better person and be more than just a meat-head. Also to be noted is the iconic theme for Rocky, Flying High Now that jacks you up and makes you feel like you could take on the world! To my surprise, I actually wasn't right about the film's conclusion, thinking I knew how it ended and it was a welcome surprise to be shocked by such a famous movie's ending after all of my preconceptions. This truly is a classic and much like the unforgettable scene of Rocky reaching the top of the steps, the film was a complete triumph and won three oscars including best picture, which was well-deserved! Do yourself a favour, and don't wait as long as I did to watch this outstanding film.",

Rocky has one of the largest hearts ever, and the people loved him for it. The romance between him and Adrian was a little weak, but all things considered, still very interesting. Carl Weathers did a great job playing an egotistical maniac. Burgess Meredith is always entertaining. Some of the best lines come from Mickey.

            "content": "Perhaps only secondary to Raging Bull as the quintessential boxing movie, Rocky serves as not quite a bio-epic but rather what seems to be by today's standard the conventional under-dog story. It may not be original in that respect but it perfects the formula beyond any trite anchors which may have held it back. Thanks largely to a top-notch script and outstanding performance by Sylvester Stallone (let's not forget Burgess Meredith as Mick) this boxing story leaps beyond it's somewhat predictable outcome and envelopes you so deeply within its world that you can't help but become emotionally involved, the build-up towards the climatic fight between Rocky and Apollo is well worth it, and although you've seen this before, a no-body gets a shot at the big time and the whole movie is spent witnessing his growth, well yeah so what, Rocky makes it not only entertaining but gripping in certain moments, adding a nice dynamic between the somewhat blunt and obtrusive Rocky and the shy introverted Adrian. Theres more going on here than meets the eye in some respects, still it doesn't exactly break any formulas but rather delivers it so wonderfully, it's greatness can't help but be credited.\n\nYou see Rocky Balboa as a scrap in the beginning, he's old past his prime, washed up-in a sense, his potential has been wasted, or rather never realized. So what do you get with an aging fighter who's given the opportunity to prove that his prime wasn't wasted but still has yet to come? Rocky is given the chance to do this and ultimately it's a question of whether he can mentally. Beneath Rocky's unsophisticated brutish nature is a sympathetic character, and that's where the film is most relatable. We get to know Rocky throughout the movie up to the final fight and watch his growth through the development of other characters, by the end of the film everyones in Rocky's corner unanimously, because he is so representative of something much larger, the humble man rising to overcome all odds and take on the world. Yeah, it's somewhat cliche, and generic by all account but as you'll see from how well done the film is, it feels almost original, and that's thanks in large part to the films outstanding performances.\n\nMany movies would follow the formula of Rocky, few have executed it as well. It's the classic under-dog story with characters deep enough to keep you engaged. Burgess Meredith as the aging trainer Mick almost makes the movie worth it by himself. The scene where Mick confronts Rocky about becoming his trainer now that Rocky has a shot at the title, and Rocky's ensuing tirade may be one of the more poignant and well done scenes. You see every bit of frustration that Rocky's feeling, all his emotion comes full surface, because under his demeanor is someone sympathetic yet the fighter in him all also prevails. No one expects Rocky to win, Rocky's fight against Apollo is supposed to be a publicity stunt, Rocky's the only one who goes in thinking it's going to be a fight. That's all Rocky wants, to give Apollo a fight, to do something no ones done before and go the distance. It's well written and well acted but it also has the intangible qualities which make it great. The film is inspirational by all conventions but much like Rocky Balboa himself it's all heart. It works.",

Although nowadays boxing films are almost a clich\u00e9, Rocky still remains a classic because it was one of the first fight films to feature an underdog character. That to me is something that cannot be duplicated. No matter how many boxing films have come after Rocky, this film along with Raging Bull is still the standard boxing dramas, and the ones that are truly worth seeing. Rocky is a brilliant film that is a definite classic, and if you really want to watch the inspirational film, pick up this one. The film features a brilliant performance by Sylvester Stallone, who delivers as Rocky Balboa. Like I previously stated, this is the film to watch if you want a terrific sports drama. What makes Rocky so special is the fact that it was made when Sports dramas were minimalistic in the sense that they didn't really have them back then. Nowadays it seems that every year there's some sort of drama and 95% of time it's about boxing. Rocky is a true original, and no matter how many films have come after it trying to duplicate its formula, there can be only one, and it's Rocky. The story is terrific, the acting incredible and the directing is terrific. No wonder it has stood the test of time, and it's refreshing no matter how many times you've seen it, and no matter how many films try to duplicate its underdog story. If you want the classic original underdog, Rocky Balboa is his name.",

While the film opens with a boxing match, it is brief. From there on, viewers get insight into the life of the protagonist. We learn that Rocky Balboa is a working class man, a boxer with a lot of heart and potential who is held back by his status in life. He is a lone wolf in a cold dark world, and the story plays on this a lot. It is a slow film, but it really emphasizes the deep nature of its protagonist through this. It works to create a touching sentiment which really gives the film a lot of soul. Rocky is a classic because it is far from a shallow, it goes to many extents to ensure that its protagonist is likable and heroic in the best sense of the words. The film doesn't tell much of Rocky's past, but it captures his present and future very well by conveying the way the simple nature of the lower class man before developing the story more. We see Rocky change as his relationships progress, as his passion enlightens and as he is given once in a lifetime opportunity. The story is inspiring not just as a sports film but also because Rocky Balboa is a man triumphing over the limitations he is stuck with in life, mainly his lower class setting and the issues he has in connecting to people. Frankly, Rocky is a complicated character and the screenplay rises the common story motifs above its potential one-dimensionality to create a thoroughly touching tale. Sylvester Stallone's screenplay in Rocky is brilliant, the finest thing he has ever written. He redefines the sports underdog tale for a generation with his story of redemption and inspirational, full of strong characters and passion which is unmatched by nearly any film in cinema. Rocky is the original sports movie, the original underdog tale. It isn't flawless, but its inspiring legacy is undeniable. The characterisation of Rocky as a man who can take so much from the world but just keep going is an unforgettably optimistic view of life even in hard times, though it is not cheesy and does not turn the tale into an overly optimistic Hollywood movie. \nRocky gains a lot of passion from the firm directorial work of John G. Avildsen. With a passionate intention to inspire audiences, he puts his heart and soul into Sylvester Stallone's screenplay and takes it all the way to the end. He puts a lot of life into the film and ensures that the atmosphere is always perfect. Capturing a combination of inspiration and grit, Rocky feels like a tale of opportunity and redemption but also one of survival due to the harsh nature of Rocky's street life. There is so much passion in the film that is unforgettable, and the John G. Avildsen captures everything well. As well as capitalising on the street scenery of the film, Rocky has a great visual palette to it thanks to ideal lighting. Everything is filmed well and the cinematography skilfully emphasizes the facial expressions of the actors as they approach the material intensively. But more impressively, the cinematography captures the boxing choreography incredibly well which is then edited with power. The boxing scenes in Rocky are incredibly powerful, and though they are few, they leave unforgettable imagery with the viewer.\nBut perhaps the most unforgettable aspect of Rocky's styls is the musical score. Featuring some inspiring pieces, Rocky pefectly sets a gentle but inspiring mood for some scenes while it intensifies in others to really empower the rough nature of the boxing in the film. Yet it does not top there because the musical score gets thoroughly touching during some of its most gentle and character-oriented moments, so Rocky is able to go between grit, energy and sympathy very well in its atmosphere. The soundtrack to Rocky and it's iconic theme \"Gonna Fly Now\" are unforgettable.\nAnd to ensure a human touch, Rocky is flawlessly cast.\nSylvester Stallone's performance as Rocky is absolutely iconic. In the physical sense, Sylvester Stallone stands strong and handles the actual boxing choreography incredibly. He floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee, really stepping up to the challenge fearlessly well. But what is more impressive is the heart in his performance. Capturing the lower class and less educated nature of the character while also conveying his sense of grit and passionate spirit, Sylvester Stallone's breakthrough role is one which puts in mind a young Marlon Brando. He plays Rocky as a powerful fighter, but he puts more heart into the role than you would ever expect simply because he plays on the more subtle emotional elements of the character nicely during many scenes. One scene in Rocky depicts Sylvester Stallone delivering a soliloquy which is unforgettable due to the simplicity and gentle nature of the scene, as well as the fact that there is nothing to hide in the moment. It is all just Sylvester Stallone lying there and pouring his soul out for viewers to see. It is brilliant, thoroughly touching and the endeavour of the soul that Rocky has. Sylvester Stallone's performance in Rocky is his most deep to date and ties with his performance as John Rambo in First Blood as his all time greatest.\nBurgress Meredith is unforgettable as well. Capturing the rowdy nature of Micky Goldmill, Burgress Meredith is relentless with the harsh way that he throws his words at Rocky. He doesn't have to do anything but stare intensively and shout his anger out at Sylvester Stallone. The two share a powerful chemistry, and Burgress Meredith really comes off as a mentor by encouraging a sense of wisdom which surpasses the less than educated status of the character. Burgress Meredith finds the ideal balance and pursues his role with a sense of grit for the part, delivering a memorable performance.\nTalia Shire is also wonderful. At the beginning of the tale she is a thoroughly introverted person who hides everything, but she slowly comes out of her shell as the tale progresses. We see her put more life into the performance and develop a strong chemistry with Sylvester Stallone, supporting the story by reminding us that the protagonist has someone worth winnning for who is supporting him every step of the way. Talia Shire's gentle performance allows her to develop life into her character very well every step of the way, and she does it wonderfully which makes her impossible to dislike.\nBurt Young is also spot on. Keeping with the gritty nature of the film, Burt Young portrays Paulie Pennino is an uneducated and similarly gritty man in the spirit of his class. He captures the low status and ignorant nature of the character, even emphasizing his disrespect for his sister to reflect negatively on him while countering that with a strong chemistry with Sylvester Stallone. He is unlikable and yet likable at the same time, and that makes him an interesting character due to the way that he assits the characterizations of Rocky Balboa and Adrian Pennino in his own way.\nCarl Weathers is a perfect casting decision as Apollo Creed. Capturing the Muhammed Ali sense of the role, Carl Weathers remains an outspoken and determined boxer in the role while adding a sense of egotism as means of touching on the commercial status of the character as the champ. He plays a likable and yet cocky character, and when he steps into the ring his fighting abilities are amazing. Carl Weathers puts up a hell of a fight against Sylvester Stallone, always changing his style to fit the mood but having no problem coming off as strong willed and determined even in the face of his own ego.\n\nSo due to its undeniable sense of inspiring work from Sylvester Stallone's screenplay and leading performance, impressively gritty directorial work from John G. Avildsen, astounding soundtrack and powerful assortment of supporting actors, Rocky is an unforgettably inspiring and touching sports classic.",

Well, I wasn't expecting much from it, but it not blew my expectations away, it took my expectations to the woods and brutally beat the shit out of them like Jason Voorhees. With every hit in the final match I found myself cheering for Rocky. I knew it wouldn't make a difference whether I cheered or not, but it was so exciting I couldn't bear not to.\r\n\r\nThe acting is top notch from Sylvester Stallone as Rocky, Burt Young as Pauly, Carl Weathers as Apollo, and ESPECIALLY Burgess Merideth as Micky, who delivers some of the greatest lines of all time, such as \"You're gonna eat lightning, and you're gonna crap thunder!\"\r\n\r\nThe movie never really got stale to me, I thought all the character's rich personality kept things interesting, like when he was supposed to break a man's thumb for not paying anything back, but decided against it, which is interesting because most people just don't have the heart that Rocky does. Burt Young is a complete douchebag at first glance, but he gets better as the series goes on. Apollo Creed is actually a pretty cool antagonist in this film, and you can just tell how much he loves his home country. Burgess Meredith also shows a lot of enthusiasm in his role, and really, the only performance I didn't like was Talia Shire's. I don't know, there's something about Adrian I never liked. In fact I found her rather annoying in the sequels, particularly Rocky 4.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I could probably call this the greatest movie of all time with 100% honesty, but is it my favorite? Nah, in fact, there's another film in this series I like even more...",

It had all the makings of a good drama - performance-wise, music-wise, and of course ending-wise. But above all, it had two remarkable actors - Sylvester Stallone as the openly brash title hero, and Talia Shire as his introverted, shy girlfriend Adrian. These two really lighted up the screen with their character contradiction - the one with \"the body without brains\", and the other \"brains without the body\", to paraphrase their own words. However, I personally thought Rocky had a pretty evident defect throughout its duration: it seemed too fast in its pace. This applied especially to all those key points in it, including Rocky and Adrian's relationship, and Rocky agreeing to take on Mickey as his manager (just after he shouts furiously at him). Other than that, it was a greatly enjoyable experience, and one that I feel was one of the most inspiring movies I have ever seen. It's definitely a must for all sports film enthusiasts (and for any film fan, for that matter), and would have been even more perfect, were it not for its fast pace.",

I love the entire cast, but its Stallone who steals the show and the audience.

Winner of best picture in 1976, Sly's underdog-hero set the standard for future American Dream movies. Seeing Rocky is a cinematic experience filled with emotion, intense passion and heart. The film's possession of realism, superb dialogue and a phenomenal music score by Bill Conti, transformed the face of cinema. However, it is not the action scenes that make Rocky so effective. Rocky isn't about the story, it's about a hero. Sylvester Stallone's performance as the Italian Stallion is sheer magic. Rocky is an authentic and touching portrait of a loser who becomes a winner in the things that matter. This is Sly's movie as he slugs his way through a heartfelt performance and delivers some cracking punches, both literally and emotionally. It's sometimes hard to remember what a great film Rocky is because its reputation has been hurt by too many unnecessary sequels, but watch it again and you soon realise why you felt so inspired and touched by Stallone's classic masterpiece.",

The movie is a celebration of humanity,of the hardships of Life and that big chance ; that one big chance which life gives us. Bolstered by brimming performances from Stallone , Talia shire and Burt Young this movie  is a masterpiece no matter what. That apologetic and sympathetic look in Stallone's face or the very heart warming  inspirational advices of the coach, that is what makes this movie a must watch. Rocky is treated as a piece of slime, he isn't respected and he is treated with contempt anywhere he goes. He gets the chance of a life time when 'Apollo Creed' the heavy weight champion just for plain publicity gives an underdog rookie a chance of his lifetime to got to the title shot straight off. All of a sudden he becomes a hero out there  and people who treated him as a piece of slime actually goes on to start helping him out. He gets an amateur trainer who for several years has been waiting for such an opportunity,even the training sequences are great. Nobody else other than stallone in the industry could have actually done that role in a more better way. Direction by Ray windelstone is amazing,powerful and will make you stand up and clap at the end. The score by John Bon jovi is great, it is pleasing and a motivating kind of music. The movie is not just about sports or winning a game like most sports dramas, this one's about human emotions of an underdog who wishes to rise above what he could achieve to prove that he is something in this world,it's about his love for a shy girl and the movie is about unfulfilled lives. This movie is more than any Sports movie it is a celebration of humanity, a very inspiring and motivational tale for all the people. \r\n\r\nMy rating : A+",

And while the ending is kind of disappointing, it's to be expected and quite frankly it would have felt cheap had the ending been any different. So yeah, the movie has problems, these no denying that, and it certainly doesn't appeal to everyone's tastes, but I personally enjoyed it. Stallone makes a great role in this one, though he's romance with Adrian (Talia Shire) is kind of forced.

But, I confess, I did like it, didn't love it but appreciated the 70s vibe, the love story and the character of Rocky Balboa.\r\n\r\nBalboa (Stallone) is a boxer at the end of his career. He's a cool dude, a nice guy with muscles. When he's not boxing he's working for a loan shark, intimidating customers. When heavyweight champ, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) loses his opponent to injury, he suggests finding a local talent to put on a show for the crowd. If the challenger wins, he takes home the title as World Champion. As if!  Creed chooses the Italian Stallion, Balboa.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Rocky is getting all romantic with his friend's sister Adrian (Shire) who is a shy little thing. They go out on a very funny and awkward date, then Balboa makes his move and they're in love! Awwww. His focus then shifts to training: running, boxing and running, jogging, sprinting, punching large bags and carcasses, then more running, this time with a mean looking dog.\r\n\r\nThen it's fight time. In one corner, there's the humble Italian Stallion and in the other, the stars and stripes clad and cocky Creed. Who will be left standing?\r\n\r\nThis is a great 70s flick. The music, the bouffant hair, the dramatic scenes with zooms. The first half plods by while the second is over before you can blink. Rocky and Adrian have a sweet romance - one might say it is true love. That will get the ladies watching and the punching, bloody scenes will keep the men keen.\r\n\r\nI love a good rags to riches story. This is a film that ticks almost all of the Oscar boxes for me, but not quite. Perhaps because I'm not a huge fan of boxing. But it is a watchable film, so if you're in the mood, check it out!\r\n\r\n'Rocky' Trivia: \r\n\r\n* A mere $1 million\r\n* Stallone insisted he star in this film after selling the rights to producers, Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff.\r\n* It was shot in 28 days\r\n* Stallone wrote the script in 3 days ... but then it was rewritten 9 times.\r\n* The character of Rocky Balboa is actually named Robert Balboa!\r\n* Elvis wanted Stallone to bring him a copy of Rocky but Stallone was too scared of him so just sent the film.\r\n* Stallone's dad rings the bell at the beginning of the fight and his brother is seen as one of the street people singing.\r\n* When Gazzo (Joe Spinell) uses the inhaler it was not in the script, Spinell was actually having an asthma attack.\r\n* The biggest expense was makeup",

Stallone was the absolute perfect character for this movie and his love interest with the shy Talia Shire is easy to relate to and his \"Cinderella\" story makes your heart fill with joy and makes you want to stand up and cheer when he knocks Carl Weathers down and i found myself talking to the T.V. saying \"Get up Rock! Get up! You can do it!\" when he was knocked down in round 14. i was slightly irritated when the bell rang to end the fight, but i got over it when Talia Shire ran up on the ring at the end of the fight and hugged Rocky. the training scene with \"Gonna Fly Now\" will pump you up and make you wanna go headbutt a brick wall just to get rid of that excess adrenaline. Bill Conti did a phenomenal job with the music. John G. Avildsen and Sylvester Stallone did an unbelievable job with this movie and it is, in my opinion the greatest movie of all time; and ive seen the godfather. every time i watch this movie i get goose bumps and want to watch it again. Rocky is such a likeable character; like when he walks little Marie home and gives her a long talk or when he punches the discarded meat as part of training. so if you want to watch a movie where you hear the word 'bum' a lot and you want to stand up and cheer for The Italian Stallion as he takes on the best fighter in the world, then buy this movie and stop being a bum right now!",
