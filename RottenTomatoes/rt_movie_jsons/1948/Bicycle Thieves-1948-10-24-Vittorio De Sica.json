    "summary": "Unemployed Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) is elated when he finally finds work hanging posters around war-torn Rome. His wife, Maria (Lianella Carell), sells the family's bed linens to retrieve Antonio's bicycle from the pawnshop so he can take the job. However, disaster strikes when Antonio's bicycle is stolen, and his new job is doomed unless he can find the thief. With the help of his lively son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola), Antonio combs the city, growing increasingly desperate for justice.",

            "content": "The one thing that bothered me about the film was that I didn't feel like it wrapped itself up too well with an ending that should've included more angles from the rest of the movie with other characters (the old man, the wife, his friends, etc.). It only involved his son (with whom which a lot was explored well) and along with that, it was a powerful movie to watch with many parallels and solid significance. I really felt empathetic and cared for the main character and wished that I could travel back in time and into the movie to give him my own bike since his intentions were good throughout much of the movie, if not for all of it! Not my favorite Italian movie but still quality for the time!",

The grinding poverty of post WW2 Italy is presented starkly. This is not the tourist Rome of La Dolce Vita but the working-class Rome of anonymous housing estates and crowded buses. Yet the film is beautiful in the ordinary. These were non-professional actors, but the father and son were utterly convincing. The opening and closing shots show the theme of the individual and the crowd. Antonio is just one person in the mass of poverty, yet his story is remarkably individual. Despite the overt downbeat nature of the ending, I think the film ends on a subtly positive note via the relationship between the father and the son. The actor who played the part of the son Bruno was exceptional. The music is beautiful too.",

            "content": "\"Bicycle Thieves\" was one of the most widely acclaimed masterworks of Italian neorealist dramas, when at the time many critics believed the movement had passed. The film is composed of a simple, albeit powerfully emotional, story of a man who after selling off all the families bed sheets, gets his bicycling back from the local pawn shop. The bicycle is essential, as Italy at the time is impoverished and jobs are scarce as everyone tries to scrape out a mediocre existence. Everything is starting to look up as Antonio, our protagonist, secures his bicycle and is hired on to put up posters and bulletins around town. The first day on the job however ends in disaster as Antonio's bicycle is stolen and the rest of the film revolves around the attempted recovery of the bicycle. All the characters throughout the entirety of the film, no matter how brief their screen time is, has a story in their eyes and on their face. It's this sense of realism and everyday circumstances that add such a deep understanding of humanity and the human soul and make for a beautiful and thought provoking masterpiece! This is cinema in its truest and most pure and that is perfect!",

One could never accuse De Sica of insidious or pretentious symbolism; the film's depiction of concrete reality is as brutally clear as it is undeniably beautiful. We are swept up in the crises of the beleaguered protagonists precisely because their humanity is never in doubt, and we admire De Sica for wisely sidestepping the easy emotional payoffs that lesser filmmakers would quickly tease out of the material. Through the consistent application of such wisdom and artistic maturity, \"Bicycle Thieves\" stands as a monument to Italian neorealism, ever reminding us of the universal and timeless nature of the perpetual human struggle.",

The child Bruno is so earnest in his support of his papa. I hate to see the father grow so frustrated and upset that he lashes out at the undeserving family trying to help him.

The acting is great and one can feel the protagonist's despair as he tries to recover his stollen bike. The story gets an additional layer when we get to know the thief and his life. A man with an equal poor life, surrounded by perhaps equal amount of  hardship.  It is interesting to see how people stick around the thief, showing a clearly decadent common moral conduct. Stealing is justifiable among them and they are oblivious to the impact of that theft on that poor man's life. The toughness and roughness of the world, with no filter or interference: just like a documentary. Worth seeing, but perhaps not when you are in need of some fantasy.",

Add in the price for healthcare and childcare on top of transportation costs and way too many people are likely working for close to net zero. Sadly, but to De Sica's immense credit, I was pondering these issues in 2021 while watching his 1948 film in which he so clearly, and heartbreakingly, displays the universal theme of poverty and the effects it has on those afflicted by it.\n\nI love when a simple narrative can leave as deep an impression as this did and serves as proof that less can definitely result in more. I think this film would never have hit as hard emotionally had these themes been laid over a more complex plot, as the simplicity made it so much easier to relate and associate with the protagonist.\n\nThe cinematography was gorgeous and the city shots and many extras worked well to create an engaging setting and mood. Maggiorani is excellent in his ability to express emotion in his lead role but his son Bruno, played by Enzo Staiola, easily made the film for me and created the most memorable scene, aside from the ending.\n\nThis film was probably just heading for an 8 to 8.5/10 until that devastatingly beautiful conclusion that totally worked for me. This felt just as likely to be the most natural ending in Italy in 1948, as it would still unfortunately be in America, in 2021.",

There's this feeling of depression throughout, I really do get the feeling that this is post WWII. He is a lucky man though having such a cute wife during these hard times. Wait wtf?! His kid works at a little gas station instead of going to school? I thought the dad was dropping him off at school, oh shit. It must be devastating to have your bike stolen back then, especially if your bike is the reason you have a job. And even more so, in an economy where people can't find jobs. \n\nWhat a fucking creep that guy who was trying to buy Bruno, his son, a bell. I'm starting to feel bad for his son, he fell in the middle of the street and the dad didn't even notice. He's dragging him into his problem and now it's affecting him. Good thing Bruno is so head strong and a tough little guy. His desperation of finding his bike is so bad that it's disrupting a church mass and he doesn't give a damn. He's giving a hard time to a poor old man. This man is lucky to have such a good son, he didn't deserve to get smacked across the face like that. And the way his son just follows him around like a street dog. I feel so bad for him. His son was actually the one who kept saving his skin. Bruno was the one who kept getting his father out of trouble and the one who saved him from going to jail. If it wasn't for his son being there, this would have turned out to be a completely different movie with a different, maybe much darker ending.\n\nWhat's darkly ironic is that the bike that he stole, looks almost identical to the one he had. It's so sad that his son had to witness his father stoop that low and become a thief himself. Essentially becoming the thing that he was hunting down. \n\nA great commentary on social classes. Wow, well there ya go folks, he never found his bike. I'm kind of glad it ended the way it did with him not finding his bike. It makes it more real. Moral of the story is don't let desperation get the best of you and consume you, because it will bring out the worst in you. With that being said though, sometimes desperate times calls for desperate measures and you can't help your actions or feelings. Really well told story with an impactful message. I can see why this movie is regarded as an essential classic in cinema history. Not something I'd really watch for fun, it's more of a life lesson kind of movie. Which is why I wouldn't buy it on Criterion, instead just own it via download.",

            "content": "Bicycle Thieves is a neorealist film at its finest. It truly showcases existence in post WWII Italy and its struggles incredibly well. A film with a plot as simple as a man searching for his stolen bike can easily become a boring piece, but this film does a fantastic job and keeping the audience intrigued the entire time. It's themes are also very applicable to today: that in a world where everyone struggles to get by, the lengths taken to ensure survival might not be encouraged, but can be understood. There are no blatant good or evil characters, just humans that do what it takes to survive in this capitalist landscape. One can definitely view this movie through an anti-capitalist lens. It provides a genuine critique on the society in Italy at the time and how people were barely scraping by, sometimes having to go to different lengths just to ensure survival and to keep a home. It also showcases that no one is special, no one is above theft and everyone is struggling. Everyone has a family and needs to provide for them, and no one is the exception to the rule. Cinematographically, it was shot beautifully, especially in scenes involving car chases or bike chases, and it also doesn't refrain from shooting long, silent, awkward shots, like the final shot of the film. Ultimately, this movie uses these shots along with superb characterization of real people to create this tale of struggle and hardship, and proving up until the end that this world is unforgiving, and sometimes we have to do whatever it takes to survive, even if morally, it's looked down upon.",

I absolutely fell in love with every character, even the bad ones, but especially the little boy. My favorite part of the film isn't even within the film itself, it's the fact that almost none of the characters are played by actual actors. I think it is a real showcase of the director's ability, and an impressive one at that. If I hadn't been told before viewing it, there's no way I would have guessed. The non-actors in the movie also represent the time period and the tone of an Italian neorealist film. Post World War II films in Italy, represent an economically shattered and morally downward spiralling country. This film is no exeption. I know I'm not allowed to complain about the lack of a happy ending, but I felt a bit disappointed by the end of this film. For me it felt like the entire movie was me waiting to be let down. I didn't like the pessimistic view, however I acknowledge that that is just a factor in most Italian neorealism films. Despite the sadness, I foun the plot to be engaging and the acting incredible. I was very impressed by the family dynamics shown on screen. This film is beautiful and will touch your heart in a way you can't forget.",

            "content": "Despite it's seemingly poor quality for 1948, The Bicycle Thieves is a film that's great because of this quality. The essence of Italian neorealism is captured in this film and is why the poorer quality of audio and use of location filming is important for this film to even work in the first place. What better way to capture the Italian post war era than by filming real people in real places.\n\tThough the story is fake, Vittorio De Sica captures real people and cultural attitudes in Italy by utilizing neorealism. He used non-actors and filmed on location only. The audio was also recorded in post for this film because of limitations by filming in real Italian streets. Details like these were what made this film shine as a gold standard for Italian neorealism.\n\tTo compliment the usage of real locations and people, De Sica showcases a society that is all to relevant to citizens of Italy in the post-war era. The film follows an impoverished man that must procure a bicycle for his new job. During his first day on the job, his bike is stolen. He must now find the bicycle with his son tagging along. During their adventure, it's clear that he's not the only poor man around town. In fact, it's a city-wide issue that is shown through the masses of people that attempt to sell their good for what little money they can acquire for food that day.\n\tBecause this film was relevant for it's time, not too many of these kinds of films were produced to this level later on. That's what makes this film special.",

From the beginning of the film one is sucked in by the mise-en-scene of the film with it following a man and his son looking for a stolen bike that the man needs for his new job. Throughout the film, De Sica uses genius camera movement and cuts to really tell the story in a meaningful way that adds heaps of emotion to it all. The most powerful part of the film is the message where it is shown that the struggles of poverty and joblessness are felt by many and that it truly is a dog eat dog world. I recommend this film, but would have to say it is not for everyone.",

Bicycle Thieves a film that surprised me with how enjoyable this film was. In one scene in the film Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) and Maria (Lianella Carell) are visiting an old lady, Antonio leaves his bicycle next by the doorway and three kids are walk in front of the camera, building tension that Antonio is going to get his bicycle stolen, he asks one of the kids to watch the bicycle for him as he goes up stairs. The whole time we watch Antonio we get a nervous feeling in our gut that his bicycle won't be there when he gets back. Antonio goes back down to his Bicycle. His bicycle was still there, we get a feeling a relief for a little bit longer. Then when his bike finally gets stolen, we all feel the heartbreak he feels. After that the whole tone of the movie changes as we spend the rest of the time with Antonio and his son Bruno (Enzo Staiola) desperately look for the bike. In the end we see Antiono at his most desperate moment as he steals a bike and then gets caught and is let go surprisingly. In the last shots we see Antonio tearing up as Bruno stands by his side, knowing that their lives are heading towards hard times. This movie has an ending that makes you think, those are truly the best endings. This film still holds up to this day and shows how effective Neorealism was during the late forties in Italian films.",

            "content": "With a different view of poverty in Italy in the 1940s, Bicycle Thieves is a wonderfully made Italian neorealist film. This is a good film because it tells us a different type of story and has very interesting shots. Bicycle Thieves is about a man who is needs a job so he buys a bike. Soon after he buys it, the bike gets stollen. The rest of the story is about how him and his son try to get it back. In the end of the movie instead of finding the bike he tries to steals a bike. While he and his son are looking for the bike he tells his son that it is bad to steel and how he should never resort to steeling. Then later he goes and tries to steel a bike, his son sees this and gets very upset at him. This moment shows that when someone is poor and they need something to survive, sometimes the only way to get it is to betray your values. This film also has a lot of very well done camera angles and shots. In the beginning when he is getting his bike there is a shot where he looks in to the storage room and you can see all the piles of bedding. Another shot that I like is when they are walking along looking at a row of bikes checking them in case one of them is his, it cuts between their faces and the bikes. I like this because it show that they are getting very desperate to find it. In conclusion the unique story line and the great shots make this a wonderful film.",

            "content": "Italy, 1940's, a country riddled with poverty, each man waiting for a job, any job to open up. Money is hard to come by and opportunities are even rarer. This is the setting for the movie The Bicycle Thieves. From the start, the movie is as engaging as it is aesthetic. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie thanks to all the innovative approaches to filmmaking. The movie projects powerful themes that were pertinent to the time. The plot is also formulated in such a way to present the essence of Italian Neorealism.\n    On top of the setting, which is a war-torn Italy during the 1940s, the themes of the movie permeate throughout the story. The feeling of despair is seemingly the most prevalent when describing this movie. The main character Antonio Ricci, played by Lamberto Marggiorani, suffers an avalanche of misfortune from life. On the surface, the story is about Ricci's bicycle being stolen, but a couple of layers deeper lies the ultimate question of morality. Throughout the movie, Ricci's son Bruno, played by Enzo Staiola, follows him closely. Bruno is witness to the events that test his father's character. The film is full of poignant shots that tell a story through its composition. Most notably, when Ricci is leaving the group of people he accused of stealing his bicycle while his son trails behind him. That scene alone conveys a sense of being lost in one's thoughts. Ricci is clearly struggling to come to terms with his misfortune and as a result, he's slowly neglecting everything else in his life. This theme is repeated both in the story and the composition throughout the movie. It happens again when Ricci leaves his son to wait by the bridge. When a young man is heard drowning, Ricci runs back panicking. His son is still at the top of the stairs next to the bridge. In a wide shot, Bruno is seen alone sitting down, simply waiting for his father. The scene evokes such a feeling of loneliness and of course despair.\n      Some of the Italian Neorealism themes that are apparent in the movie strikes a chord with the audience, mostly because they are easily relatable. The movie starts out with a group of men struggling to get work. From the outset, it is clear that the economy is not great. The lack of a job brings with it so many other problems. This is the issue that haunts Ricci throughout the movie. He simply desires to have a job, and for that, he needs his bicycle. Along with struggling to find his bicycle in order to keep his job, he's slowly and subtly being tested by the misfortunes of life. His son Bruno is a constant reminder of the obligations he has in his life. The threat to his pride along with his sense of being a proper man and father is constantly attacked. This is the crux of the conflict. The underlying trouble doesn't seem to go away. His will to sacrifice everything is endemic in his actions at the end of the movie. \nIn conclusion, this movie is a wonderful example of what can be done with the right ideas in play. It's proof positive of the importance of the story to the success of the movie. It's such a great film because the audience can empathize with the characters from the start.",

            "content": "The movie Bicycle thieves was a very interesting situation that looks at a broader picture regarding wealth distribution and inequality in Italy. I think the intent of this movie is to show the working man's plight. It is very difficult at the time for Antonio to provide for his family because there are many barriers to employment. He finds a job but has to sell his sheets to pay for a bike, and that ends up getting stolen. I think what this movie is trying to show is that the injustice isn't Antonio getting his bike stolen, or Antonio trying to steal somebody else's bike, but the hierarchy they are all forced to live in that pits poor against poor while the wealthy prosper. The whole movie we are lead to believe that the thief is the villain of this movie but then we see Antonio try to do the same thing just so he can provide for his family which made me think that the original thief was probably just trying to provide for his family. What this movie does is show people who commit crimes to provide for their family are forced into these situations because of factors out of their control. It shows that the real injustice is that society allows poverty to exist to maintain a hierarchy. Overall, The Bicycle Thief made a very strong argument regarding class. It is society's fault when poor are pitted against poor as an expense of the very wealthiest consumption of resources.",

            "content": "Heartfelt and devastating.\n\nVittorio De Sica's Italian Neo-realist drama Bicycle Thieves (1948) is a poignantly moving picture about post-war Italy's general poverty and the desperation that fosters in mankind. De Sica's direction is a striking parable on the virtues of being honest. Bicycle Thieves is all about how far can a man be driven before he may resort to crime. People can only take so much of poverty and desperation with few employment opportunities or financial options. De Sica's direction is so compelling that Bicycle Thieves 89 minute run-time will feel like just a half hour. It's a brisk and honest film about how hard it was to gain employment and take care of your family in Italy at the time.\n\nAlessandro Cicognini music is a hypnotizing wonder full of romance, anxiety, panic, excitement. I love the way the music rises for the chase sequences and all the nervous feelings. Carlo Montuori is a fantastic cinematographer as Bicycle Thief with numerous wide shots of Rome to let you see if you can appreciate how difficult life was for Italians as WWII.\n\nLamberto Maggiorani is phenomenal as the leading man named Antonio Ricci. His tear-filled eyes and yearning are all apparent on Maggiorani's face. He is a highly sympathetic character as his environment yields little love and kindness. You feel terrible for the entire ordeal that Antonio undergoes. His face when he realizes that he must tell his wife that his bike was stolen or when he is deciding whether or not to steal a bike for himself are powerful moments within a genius performance. He delivers the role of a lifetime.\n\nI must mention the funny Italian child actor, Enzo Staiola, playing Antonio's son Bruno Ricci. He is eager to help his father as well as takes his father's scorn to heart. You really feel like you're watching a real boy trying to get by with his dad.\n\nLastly, I really enjoyed Lianella Carell as Maria Ricci. Her anguished looks at her family's poverty stricken situation are devastating to witness.\n\nIn short, Bicycle Thieves contemplates the value of life, fatherhood, friendship, poverty, employment, patriotism, and individuality.",

The best word I could use to describe the layout and aesthetic of the film is simplistic. It's filmed in black and white, uses non-professional actors, has no action scenes and was made decades before C.G.I. was even a dream. What the film does is strip everything to the bare bones, exposing the very nature of the human being and all its flaws and weaknesses. On the surface, it's a story about a man who has his bike stolen, and if he can't retrieve it he'll lose the job he so desperately needs to feed his family. But his quest to accomplish this turns out to be an allegory for the uncaring and selfish nature of humanity. His encounters with angry mobs, unscrupulous locals and unsympathetic authorities drive him to the brink of despair. It's a testament to the films legacy that the issues it raises are still just as relevant and important today as they were then, more half a century ago. It's rightly regarded as one of the most important and influential movies ever made, and its final scenes are some of the most emotionally affecting in the history of cinema.",

It may seem a bit clich\u00e9, but this movie is the finest example of \"says so much by saying so little\". Carlo Montuori's cinematography couldn't have been more expressive, and Lamberto Maggiorani couldn't have embodied his character better. Not to mention the sweet relationship between Antonio Ricci and his son, Bruno, that brought us some of the most heartbreaking and poignant moments in film, while granting other humorous moments that will put smile on your face involuntarily. Thanks in large part to Enzo Staiola's likable performance. A performance that reminded me of Giorgio Cantarini's performance in La Vita \u00e8 Bella, another Italian film that is influenced by Bicycle Thieves in terms of the father/son relationship.\n\nTruth be told, Vittorio De Sica's intimate direction is what took this movie to a higher level. A direction that took advantage of the simplicity of the story in the best possible way. You can't help putting yourself in the protagonist's shoes, and rooting for him, and his cute son, like you haven't done before. It's a direction that made the naivety of the situations you see the characters get through seem so genuine and authentic that you feel you've been a member of this poor and simple society all through your life.\n\nCesare Zavattini's Oscar nominated screenplay should be praised for balancing between the progress of the main plot adding many layers to it, and making it feel more complicated, while fleshing out the characters with no much dialogue. That being said, it's the movie's script that is flawed. there is timing inaccuracy, and plot holes that can be a tad bit infuriating.\n\nThe music by Alessandro Cicognini played a key role in keeping the tragic tone underneath most of the movie to use it later while reflecting the protagonist's misery.\n\nOverall, Ladri Di Biciclette is an honest, simple, and unpretentious portrait of the struggle for life and self-esteem that deserves every bit of recognition it gets. An Italian classic through and through!\n\n(9/10)",

This Italian Film is directed by \"Vittorio Di Sica\".  \n\nThis movie is a true Masterpiece. It is a masterpiece in film making, not just Italian movie making but it is a landmark movie in our cinema industry. The movie is about a man who has been unemployed for many months but finally gets a job of putting up posters. He & his family have been living in poverty & they are excited to know about this job. But the only requirement for this job is that he should have a \"bicycle\" for this job. The thing his wife does to get him a bicycle made me so emotional. But the bicycle gets stolen on the first day of the work. The journey of a father & a son roaming the streets of Rome to get the cycle back takes you through an emotional side of human nature. \n\nIn the end, I would like to say if you haven't seen the movie please go & see the movie. This is the one of the best movies you will ever see & will tell you about the real human nature that we see around us now. Lamberto Maggiorani & Enzo Staiola did such a magnificent work in the movie.\n\nHighly Recommended. ????",

            "content": "It is difficult to appreciate a story about a stolen bike in today's day and age.  After all, it seems that in a world of seemingly endless credit, how difficult is it to procure a $100 bicycle?  However, this common fixture in the modern world contrasts starkly with that of post-war Italy, where poverty and scarcity of goods were a reality.  My parents immigrated from Italy in 1951, so I speak from direct family experience.\n\nPutting the issue of a simple bike theft into perspective, this film must be appreciated for its ability to absorb the viewer into the plot and characters, despite how simple the premise may be.  I found myself totally absorbed, despite reminding myself that after all, this is all simply for a bike?  I put it in the context of how valuable a vehicle is to a family today, given that it is required to hold a job that is essential to putting food on a poor family's table.  And this, in an era before \"no money down\" and \u00f6ther modern credit enhancements designed to place valuable goods in the hands of insatiable consumers.\n\nThe film's protagonist is accompanied by his young son, who seems to represent his conscience.  It's a real pity that Lamberto Maggiorani never really found meaningful work as an actor again, and even lost his job.after this film, despite this film becoming so critically appraised globally.  What is worse, he only earned the equivalent of US$1,000 for this masterpiece.  Even Enzo Staiola, the young child actor, found his future as a math teacher rather than an actor despite his brilliant performance.\n\nThe film represents a crowning benchmark of neo-realist cinema.  Non-actors within a realistic plot.  This is about as far from Hollywood as one can get, and Italian cinema was the centre for neo-realism after World War 2.  \n\nI recommend this film for lovers, students and professionals of classic cinema.  This is not one for mass consumption, Hollywood, formulaic blockbuster aficionados.",

            "content": "The Bicycle Thief is not only a powerful cinematic representation of the struggles of working class Italians but also a compelling analysis of the relationship between father and son. The father of a family is typically the one to provide for a household but not in the case of the Bicycle Thief. Bruno, the son, is not in school. Instead, he has a job and must fend for himself. The real-world struggles Bruno is exposed to tarnish his innocence and force him into assuming the role of the breadwinner. Although the film depicts an adult-like Bruno, it is his true childish nature that ultimately saves his father from the harsh realities of his destructive behavior.\n\nFrom the beginning of the film, it is evident that Bruno takes on more responsibility than his father. In his first scene, Bruno is cleaning the bicycle, a task his father, Antonio, should be doing. When Antonio walks in, he says, \"Hurry up, Bruno\". Bruno modestly tells his father that it is difficult for him to clean the bicycle in the dark, implying that he has been up before sunrise working hard, which is unusual for a child his age. Immediately after this statement, Bruno walks over to the window and opens the shutters to let in the natural light. This enables him to finish his task and allows his father to get dressed. Furthermore, Bruno is the one who assumes responsibility for the baby. Antonio and Bruno are about to leave the room and go off to work, but Bruno suddenly stops and glances over at the restless infant squirming in bed. Like a responsible parent, he closes the shutters to make sure the baby can fall back asleep. \n\nJust as he cares for the bicycle and the baby, Bruno supports the family. Instead of going to school, Bruno works as a gasoline pump assistant. When Antonio's bike is stolen, he is ashamed to tell Bruno and acts childish by lying to Bruno about the whereabouts of the bicycle. Even worse, Antonio is now unable to work his job. Yet, Bruno still holds a steady job, and this helps to advance him further into the role of an adult, as he is now the provider for the family.\n\t\nAs mentioned earlier, Bruno holds more care and responsibility for the bicycle than his father. This is stressed again in the scene when Baiocco, Meniconi, Bagonghi, Antonio, and Bruno are gathered together at the Piazza Vittorio to look for the stolen bicycle. When Antonio is asked what the make of the bicycle is, it is Bruno who quickly responds thereby illustrating, unlike his father, that he understands how vital this bicycle is to the family's survival. \n\nIn addition to holding a job and caring for the bicycle and baby, Bruno protects his father. After Antonio and Bruno find the man who stole their bicycle, a ruckus breaks out. While the crowd is screaming at Antonio, Bruno runs to find the police to defend his father. At this point, Bruno's maturity is stronger than it is at any other point in the film. Because of this, he is effectively transitioned into an adult and has solidified his role of the father figure.\n\nWhile he has assumed the role of an adult throughout the film, the final scene reveals the true, childlike disposition of Bruno. After an angry crowd chases down Antonio after he steals a bicycle, he is hit, slapped, and scolded. Shortly after, Bruno identifies with his childish nature, runs to his father, and cries. The owner of the bicycle is about to send Antonio to the police station until he sees Bruno's heartbroken face and decides to let Antonio go. \n\nUnlike a stereotypical carefree childhood, the children of war-torn Italy had to take on adult responsibilities. In the Bicycle Thief, Bruno accepts the responsibility of a man providing financial and emotional support for his family. Caring for and protecting the family and its belongings, including a baby and a bicycle, Bruno functions as an adult; ironically, it is his true identity as a child that ultimately saves his father from facing punishment.",

            "content": "Italian Neorealism, otherwise known as the Golden Age of Italian Cinema, was a term coined for the Italian national film movement, like the French New Wave or German Expressionism, which dealt with the difficult economic and moral conditions of post-World War II from the perspective of the working class. But, Neorealism went further than just the aftermath of war; it got to the crux of the Italian psyche and characterised the changes to the conditions of everyday life. Vittorio De Sica\u00e2??s film, Bicycle Thieves, known in Italy as Ladri di Biciclette, had an enormous impact on world cinema for its honest depictions of post-war society, influence on future filmmakers and simple yet universal meaning, suggests Bicycle Thieves is an indelible film for every generation as its content relates to everyone, some more than others. Made only three years after the worst war in history, Bicycle Thieves is undeniably an indication of a post-war bitterness that infected many.\n \nBicycle Thieves follows the life of a poor father, Antonio Ricci, whose family, a wife and young son, are on the verge of becoming impoverished during post-World War II Rome. After attaining work and earning enough money to buy a bicycle to travel there, Antonio\u00e2??s bike is stolen and the film spends time searching with Antonio for his bicycle, without which he will be unable to work and in turn support his family. On this quest to retrieve his bicycle, Antonio bonds with his young son and comes to terms with the despondency the post-war strife instilled into people. Bicycle Thieves essentially utilises something so simplistic in a bicycle and through this emblem makes scathing indictments of post-war society.\n \nA typical aspect of Neorealism is the use of non-professional actors to add to the sense of underlying realism. Lamberto Maggiorani portrays Antonio Ricci, a blue-collar worker desperate for work to support his family. Maggiorani has the look and the appeal to pull off the protagonist. With an almost withered-looking face, eyes of intolerable desperation and a sense of universality to his general appearance, Antonio could be played by anyone because the post-war discord affected everyone... but Maggiorani is faultlessly brilliant. Enzo Staiola is Bruno Ricci, Antonio\u00e2??s son. Staiola\u00e2??s young appearance should not taking anything away from his acting as he stands side by side with Maggiorani for the entire film. Staiola\u00e2??s plucky performance serves the father-son relationship well for his perceptiveness proves that his character is as profound as Antonio. It is the script that allows Maggiorani and Staiola to thrive because by focusing on two characters and their quest, it becomes possible to immerse oneself completely in the story and mould an understanding of how the context of 1948 affected civilians.\n \nBicycle Thieves\u00e2?? lasting success lies in the fact that it is so simple in its representations of post-war society, yet the magnitude of these depictions is immense. Its simplicity, or ordinariness, comes in the form of the bicycle being used as a major plot point, white sheets are integral, the protagonists have lunch in a restaurant, then move on to a market, church and football stadium. Even the black and white footage heightens the sense of reality as it lays bare the city and characters for the audience to assess. These mundane elements are so integral to the film that as a collective their significance becomes amplified and they then take on a critiquing function towards society. The manner the regular locations, meanings behind scenes and the bare authenticity of the acting compliment each other emphasises the hopelessness of the society these characters inhabit as the mirror image of the actual society of many nations after the war.\n \nAlthough considered one of the greatest foreign films ever made, Bicycle Thieves is undoubtedly the greatest Italian film to be created, surpassing the likes of Life is Beautiful and La Dolce Vita with this title. Not only did Bicycle Thieves influence the filmmakers that have influenced the current crop of filmmakers, it has become a timeless film that is now utilised as a source for educating film. Nowadays, black and white flicks are ignored for being boring to watch and out of touch with society, as they lack the visually ecstatic blockbuster material needed to whip up a storm. But, because not much attention was paid to the visuals, everything else is rich with more depth than you could imagine. Bicycle Thieves is a classic in achieving the \u00e2??less is more\u00e2?? look because who would have thought that a man searching for his bicycle would have profound contextual connotations and a critical stance over the detriments of society. Many countries have their own films to represent the effects of war, with America it is more visibly dramatic and emotional, for Britain it is a gritty, war-torn land with strong individuals, but for Italians the straightforwardness of their depictions revealed the true face of a corroding society.\n \nThe Verdict:\n \nCreated only three years after the end of World War II, Bicycle Thieves is very much a symptom of the post-war struggles inflicted upon society, for its simplistic approach to such a complex condition renders it powerfully meaningful.\n \n\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??     9/10",

            "content": "Following the Italian Neo-realist film movement set by Luchino Visconti's \"Obsession,\" Vittorio De Sica's \"Bicycle Thieves\" has been the exception or most highlighted film among the other Italian Neo-realist films and is often used to define the movement itself--which is characterized by non-professional actors, actual locations in Rome, set among the collective individual during post-war Italy, etc. In the establishing shot, we see a bus driving down a road and in the peripheral background, we can see what looks like desolate land affected by the war. It is important to notice that De Sica simply focuses on the bus and tries to direct our attention away from the background. It is in this that De Sica puts us in the impoverished individual's P.O.V.--like how the average working class is accustomed to their residence, the camera acts the same way by being almost oblivious to its desolate surroundings. Our leading man is Antonio Ricci (played by the amateur Lamberto Maggiorani) who is given the job to stick movie posters around Rome, but the catch is that he needs a bicycle to get the job and does not have the lira to buy one. He and his wife, Maria (Lianella Carell), sell their linen bed sheets in order to get the money. In this memorable scene, we see the shopkeeper climb up levels of shelves filled with linen bed sheets in order to put Ricci and Maria's in among with the others, establishing the collective poverty. Ricci gets his bicycle immediately after selling the sheets, and is so excited to get his hands on it, he tugs it away from the manager before he can get the tag off. As Maria and Ricci ride home on the bicycle, they are much more optimistic and hopeful for their family's future; they have a son named Bruno (Enzo Staiola) and a small infant. Their happiness rests solely on the new bicycle, literally making it the physical embodiment of hope in a harsh society. And of course that hope is taken from them, sending Ricci and his son, Bruno, on a search that feels much longer than one exhausting afternoon. While on the search, Bruno and Ricci get rained on and rush to shelter. As they stand there, a foreign language family run into frame next to Bruno and Ricci. The foreigners start conversing with each other; Bruno and Ricci stuck in the middle of the strangers conversation under the downpour. It is in this scene that Ricci and Bruno's position in the world is artistically established which only adds to the charming subtleties and intimacies that \"Bicycle Thieves\" contemplates on. Further in the search, father-son drama is shown between Bruno and Ricci, which the film begins focusing on more significantly. In these scenes we are given subtle development of Ricci's, somewhat, bland character, revealing him when he's stressed, shocked, conscious, and when he's brought to his lowest point. Both major performances, Ricci and Bruno, are played intimately and, surprisingly, with professional subtlety by two unprofessional actors. In particular, Enzo Staiola gives an exceptionally empathetic child performance that is possibly the highlight of the film. \"Bicycle Thieves,\" unexpectedly, becomes a father-son tale, not only exploring the affects of poverty, but its affects on a family and, more significantly, on a father and a son",

Apparently the voice you hear of the leading man, the \"man without a label\" as the screenwriter calls him, is actually dubbed by a different actor. I could not distinguish this idea at all during my viewing, so it didn't break the illusion of the movie.\n\nThe movie may only capture the events a tight time-span (two days or less), but it does it marvelously. I'll admit there is not too much going on after the man's bike is stolen and he and his son walk around Rome trying to find it, but there is a wonderful scene that depicts the class struggle where the man and his son eat at a restaurant and the man explains the importance of the bike. The boy sees a wealthier kid enjoying the luxury of melted cheese on his sandwich whereas the two characters at the center of the story have to have basic sandwiches due to their shortcomings. It is a simple, yet powerful scene.\n\nThis film deals with harsh realities as the dad is unable to ever retrieve his bike - the boy who stole it probably having sold the parts before he could get to it. It is also such a powerful and shocking ending with what the protagonist decides to do, and with the kid holding his father's hand at the conclusion of the film, it is an action that shows they are now equals. They seem to be doomed to live in poverty, and the man has shown what it truly takes to survive in this dog eat dog world.",

It's filmed in black and white, uses non-professional actors, has no action scenes and was made decades before C.G.I. was even a dream. What the film does is strip everything to the bare bones, exposing the very nature of the human being and all its flaws and weaknesses. On the surface, it's a story about a man who has his bike stolen, and if he can't retrieve it he'll lose the job he so desperately needs to feed his family. But his quest to accomplish this turns out to be an allegory for the uncaring and selfish nature of humanity. His encounters with angry mobs, unscrupulous locals and unsympathetic authorities drive him to the brink of despair. It's a testament to the films legacy that the issues it raises are still just as relevant and important today as they were then, more half a century ago. It's rightly regarded as one of the most important and influential movies ever made, and its final scenes are some of the most emotionally affecting in the history of cinema.",

            "content": "Bicycle Thieves is an overwhelmingly real viewing experience. I don't know how else to put that really...it's a staple of the Italian Neorealism movement, which was characterized by \"stories set amongst the poor and the working class, filmed on location, frequently using non-professional actors\" and focused on the \"difficult economic and moral conditions of Italian post-World War II, representing changes in the Italian psyche and conditions of everyday life, including poverty, oppression, injustice and desperation.\"\n\nIt's an incredibly down-to-earth film and aims at being as realistic/relevant as it can be, and it succeeds. Almost 65 years later, I found myself sobbing at the heartbreaking closing scene, where a crowd of jobless and poor Italian men and women march the streets with tears in their eyes. The struggle of one man, searching for some economic stability in his life through the simplest of means - a bicycle - acts as a much larger political symbol (specifically the director's own Marxist beliefs, another staple of the Italian neorealist movement) relevant to the time yet still somehow relatable. It presents to you what happens one day in the life of the protagonist without ever really forcing you to feel what it wants you to feel (if that makes any sense whatsoever). It happens naturally and you find yourself becoming more and more invested in the well-being of the characters, despite never really knowing too much about them.\n\nA wonderfully emotional experience and a breathtakingly beautiful film!",

            "content": "If you were to rank the films that carry the greatest burden of expectation, Vittorio de Sica's \"Bicycle Thieves\" would certainly be near the top of the list. \n\nBut compared to others, such as the other two films to have topped Sight and Sound's famous critics poll--\"Citizen Kane\" and \"Vertigo\"-- \"Bicycle Thieves\" isn't really loaded with subtle visual metaphors, technical complexity, or weighty psychological depth; this is not the kind of movie you'll work to parse meaning from or wrestle to understand. \n\nRather, its virtues are more immediately gratifying: a stunningly honest slice-of-life tale with lyrical cinemetography and deliberate pacing (that some might call slow or even dull; for me, the lack of rising action only served to sharply contrast the increasing monotony of utter hopelessness). Quite simply, this movie broke my heart.\n\nEnzo Staiola's performance as Bruno is justly regarded as brilliant; easily the best turn from a young actor since Jackie Coogan in Chaplin's \"The Kid.\" Lamberto Maggiorani's performance, on the other hand, I find to be shockingly underrated-- even the most ardent lovers of the film will lament his stiff, nervous, unnatural acting, but I couldn't disagree more. His nervousness is pain, his eyes soulful and aching; the whole character presented as both a universal archetype and a specific, wounded man full of personality and inner life. It's an amazing, iconic performance.\n\nThis is a film that comes loaded with baggage; the kind that might make a viewer say \"Really? That's it?\" because it might appear to be a \"small\" movie. But its relative \"smallness\" is deceptive, only serving to prove that movies are only as big or small as their emotional potency or thematic breadth will allow. In that sense, it's a movie that is infinite and universal in its scope-- which means \"Bicycle Thieves\" just might be the biggest movie of them all.",

            "content": "Said to be one of the single greatest Italian films of all time, The Bicycle Thief sounded to me like a good chance to take another look at world cinema.\n\nAs with many films which fit the profile of adhering to a more classical style, coming from a foreign area of cinema and central to a different time in history. That meant that I found The Bicycle Thief to be a very slow film and that the effect it would have made upon its original release did not leave the same precise mark on me. I enjoyed The Bicycle Thief, but not precisely as much as everyone else did mainly because the slow pace of the film made the drama somewhat distant from me at times and left the effect of it all less consistent with me than it seems to be with everyone else. Also, I can't say that I was fully aware of the cultural relevance of the film due to not understanding too much about Italian culture outside of what films I had seen. Most Italian films I had learned about their culture came from Roberto Benigni's La Vita e Bella or Michael Radford's Il Postino: The Postman. Either way I didn't understand too much about the cultural meaning of the film and was only able to take it on for its personal value. I could be looking too much into it, but I felt like there was cultural significance to the film that I didn't understand as much as the people who lived through that time or live in Italy.\nThe Bicycle Thief nevertheless remained a touching film. The surface concept of it was very interesting because of the way that it depicted a bike being at the heart of so much. A bicycle is what the protagonist Antonio Ricci requires to raise money as a means of feeding his family, and it is what they pawn much of their possessions to raise money for. In short, the bicycle is what the family needs to survive. It maintains all of their hopes and dreams, and so when it is stolen in a moment of selfish crime, that is the future of an entire family being snatched out from under them. The Bicycle Thief is a film which challenges viewers to consider precisely how major the effect of committing a minor crime can be, and it does so with its bare basic concept on the surface but later makes it even better as it gets into an exploration of it. The thing which is beautiful about the film is its nihilism. It is never optimistic about the harsh reality of the world for the lower class victims of an unfair society, and it explains this by depicting the struggles of such people on a level of both class and emotional turmoil, the latter of which is explained through the relationship between Antonio Ricci and his son Bruno. The Bicycle Thief may explore its drama on a subtle level which may not be easy for every viewer to grasp, but those who can should truly be able to appreciate the heartfelt sentimental value of The Bicycle Thief. The story is an admirable one because once viewers get a feel and an understanding for the nihilistic melancholy of the film. The Bicycle Thief has a beautiful atmosphere to it which makes it a touching film if viewers can really embrace what is happening, so its gradually burning drama seems to end up being sensible.\nThe Bicycle Thief is a very old fashioned film because it maintains the same style of filmmaking that many films of the era did which proves to be the source of any of the flaws in the film, in particular the aforementioned slow pace of the film. But it also establishes a lot of positive aspects for the film such as beautiful cinematography which works well to capture the excellent production design and scenery of the film. It captures the large spectacle of the surroundings by showing the large world around the characters, and it does help to give viewers an understanding of everything that is happening. Everything in The Bicycle Thief looks and feels appropriate.\nAnd the acting in The Bicycle Thief is very strong as well.\nLamberto Maggiorani is spot on in the leading role in The Bicycle Thief. He is handed a great character as written by Vittorio De Sica and acts it out so organically with natural humanity and compelling sympathy. He is good at conveying the stress of a struggling lower class person as well as a father in The Bicycle Thief which is part of what establishes the touching edge of the material. Although it is his debut as an actor, Lamberto Maggiorani easily makes himself a compelling lead in The Bicycle Thief. A lot of the importance rests on how he establishes the father-son relationship that he shares with the character portrayed by Enzo Staiola as well as how he conveys the love that he maintains for his family and why he is fighting so hard to a simply bicycle, and it is just too admirable. First time actor Lamberto Maggiorani does an excellent job in The Bicycle Thief because he takes on the role of a determined and troubled father with easy passion, and it ties the heart of the story together really well.\nEnzo Staiola is also great in The Bicycle Thief. In his youth, he is able to handle the edge of the story really well and act alongside Lamberto Maggiorani very finely. He is thoroughly sympathetic and compelling in the role without challenge thanks to his natural juvenile charm, so he enhances the emotional qualities of the film.\n\nSo while The Bicycle Thief maintains the same slow pace you might expect from such an old film with a classical style, the touching story and detailed script combined with the passionate cast of the film make it a memorable and emotionally worthy experience as a film.",

I was starting to think that maybe these kinds of films aren't for me, but seeing Bicycle Thieves changed all that. I may not consider the film the masterpiece that the majority claim it to be, but it certainly is a powerful film and the best I have seen so far from The Golden Age of Italian Cinema.\n\nThere is nothing simpler than the plot of Bicycle Thieves, a man and his son searches and tries to claim back his stolen bicycle in order for him to continue working. The film makes up for this basic plot by placing heavy metaphors that enriches both the film's characters and setting. Whilst searching for the bicycle, we are treated to the poor living conditions of the many citizens that were affected the 2nd World War; families selling their linens in order to make money, relying on job opportunities to come to them rather than making one of their own, relying on spiritual guidance in order to predict the outcome of their problems, and the lack of morality in individuals in order to make ends meet are some of the few examples that this film was able to demonstrate that speaks genuinely to the conditions of that time. Director Vittorio De Sica could have simply added those elements in, in order to push the plot forward but he wanted the film to be much more than that, this film serves as a time capsule of a time that many have forgotten and letting the fortunate people see that no matter what your problem is now, there were people suffering much worse back then, as losing something as simple as a bicycle would define your entire life.\n\nThe film strives for authenticity and I truly admire that, but there are one or two scenes in this film, which I personally felt could have improved in its execution. I wanted these scenes to contain a bit more drama than what was served on screen as it would have allowed me to further gain a much deeper connection with its characters. These scenes were only found around the film's first half, as once it hits halfway, it started to roll faster and the impact was much larger.\n\nThe decision for De Sica and his cinematographer Carlo Montuori to shoot in the streets of Rome allows the film to capture that authenticity that a film set simply couldn't do. The film was created during a time where Italy was still suffering from the catastrophe that is World War 2, and the director has done a marvellous job in letting its audience feel immersed in the environment, seeing and feeling the crumbs that were left by the bombing of Rome. Showing the film in black and white amplifies the pain and suffering of both the low-working class citizens and the city itself, and if I saw this film during the time of its release, it would have been difficult for me to ever think that the city and its people would ever thrive like they used to.\n\nAlessandro Cicognini's score also captures the travesty of the film's setting, as many of its segments comes out sorrowful and lacking in any sense of hope, while some parts, mainly at the start of the film, show a sense of optimism that parallels with our protagonist's feelings. Cicognini's work may not be regarded as one of cinema's greatest best, at least for me, but it was powerful enough for me to gain an understanding of the film's atmosphere and the feelings of its characters.\n\nDe Sica's choice of utilizing non-professional actors was a smart decision as instead of having individuals pretend to be affected by the conditions of that environment, why not simply take men and women who are a living embodiment of post-World War 2 Rome. Lamberto Maggiorani and Enzo Staiola who plays the film's two central roles, performed wonderfully. They avoided adding any sense of melodrama in their performances and keeping the chemistry between the two of them feel authentic.\n\nVery few films could capture the authentic emotions and atmosphere that Bicycle Thieves was able to deliver; Vittoria De Sica\u00e2??s Bicycle Thieves is a treasure.",

            "content": "Now I can tick another acknowledged masterpiece off my watch-list, De Sica's timeless Neo-realism opus comprises of a non-professional cast, sternly portrays a grim reality of the post-WWII Italy, sets in a three-days span, Antonio (Maggiorani) is fortuitous enough to procure a job of pasting posters (Rita Hayworth's lionized poster of GILDA 1946) among the massive unemployed, but a bicycle is a prerequisite to secure the job, it is a luxury for his impoverished family, anyhow, they sell the bedsheets and get a bicycle, it seems that everything is going to be on the right track! \n\nA brief interlude happens when his wife Maria (Carell) detours to visit a seer to remunerate her prophecy, Antonio leaves his new bicycle downstairs and asks some kids playing around to keep an eye on it, then he goes upstairs to find out who is the mysterious woman Maria is visiting, it is an ingenious ploy to incite curiosities of whether the bicycle will be stolen or not, and forebodes the negligence later in the film, the bicycle is nicked in the first day of his work. \n\nInstead of going back home to be enveloped in Maria's whine and fault-finding, Antonio is a man of action, he contacts his friends for help and the next day, with his elder boy Bruno (Staiola), they roam around Rome and try to find the thief, which we all know is a long shot and it dooms to be a long day. From patrolling the recycling market to pursue a beggar who is in contact with the thief in the church, all the effort turns out to be fruitless, during the church scenes, there is trenchant allusion of religion's sanctimoniousness, it is no more than a relief station while justice is never an option for a non-believer. \n\nAntonio brings Bruno for a treat despite of all the frustrations, it is also a guilty compensation after his harsh behavior towards the innocent boy, the contrast between Bruno and a rich boy in the restaurant is glaringly affecting, it is when an idea comes to Antonio's mind, out of desperation, he resorts to the seer, to something he gives no credence, and after a bragging twaddle like \"you will only find it now or never\", ironically, right after he leaves the seer's building, the suspect is precisely walking in front of his eyes. Then things come to a maddening climax, without clear evidence and with the aid of a throng of protective neighbors, the thief amateurishly fakes a seizure to earn onlooker's compassion, even the policeman cannot help Antonio to arrest the miscreant. \n\nIn the last resort, Antonio commits the theft to a bicycle, but he is outrun by the masses chasing him and to his mortification, Bruno witnesses everything with sobbed eyes, pragmatically, he is let off the hook, at least the world shows some mercy in the end, the ending sees Antonio and Bruno walk along with the stream of people, the future is unbeknown to them. \n\nEnzo Staiola is naturally endearing as the precocious son to whom audiences will ceaselessly project their empathy, brilliantly cast, so it Lamberto Maggiorani, adheres to life but seethes with anxiety. Alessandro Cicognini's pensive score is sometimes obtrusive but consistently emotive, and Carlo Montuori's cinematography enriches the misery with visceral intensity by shedding light on the close-ups to indicate characters' inner states. \n\nThe film is a substantiated indictment for inequity which permeates the society ingrainedly, it doesn't extol the image of Italians after WII, but it never demonize them either, most of the people are from the struggled class, the moral ambiguity is a blockade to condemn them since life is not easy for any of them. First and foremost the film's sociological study on humanism enshrined itself as unsurpassable opus in the entire film history and its appeal is purely timeless.",

This one is absolutely a must watch for people who love film and is very much watchable. However, where this one struggles is that it undoubtedly can get quite boring at times and is very slow without question. In addition, while the melodrama is expected, it is a tad overbearing at times. Yet, in spite of those negatives, the story, while simple, is very interesting and while it serves as a background for everything else, it really helps tie everything together. Overall, I cannot rate this one higher because I did not enjoy it enough, but I certainly appreciate it regardless.",

            "content": "Vittorio De Sica' s 1948 film Ladri di Biciclette (The Bicycle Thieves) has generated enough acclaim in its life that it's hard to justify writing another review of it. Nonetheless, as an aspiring screenwriter, after I came across a 1950 NY Times article by Arthur Miller that praised the film for its simplicity, I though Ladri di Biciclette would be worth examining for the purposes of learning about simple filmmaking. How to make a great film based on a simple story with very few characters. Arthur Miller calls this one-track conflict of a film \"to be very close to a lyrical masterpiece.\"\n\n\n\nThe plot is simple: Jobs are scarce in Rome yet the protagonist Man fortuitously procures one. This job requires a bicycle which the Man also fortuitously procures. During the the Man's first day on the job his bicycle is stolen. The rest of the film focuses on his crusade to find the stolen bicycle and thereby remain employed.\n\nThere is a real aesthetic beauty as the Man and his Son tramp the streets, the camera follows, and the city dominates. Rome is so influential that characters lives, their interactions, and their relationships are molded and shaped by her. As the man follows clues to track down his bicycle he transverses what seems like the whole city. Moving from one Roman neighborhood to another, new scenes mean new characters, and new characters mean new conflicts.\n\nThere are many touching scenes between the Man and his Son, but one especially where we think the Son has been hurt. This scene reaffirms that the Man's true priorities are first and foremost with his family, but within seconds the Man is pulled right back into the chaos of the hunt for the bicycle. Throughout the entire film injustice reigns, paired with the utter simplicity of the film's production, Ladri di Biciclette is a truly remarkable achievement. An example of unadorned, simple cinema.\n\n\n\n\nThe plot is simple: Jobs are scarce in Rome yet the protagonist Man fortuitously procures one.

We see the life of a protagonist as a struggling head of family with a loving wife who bends over backwards to get the bicycle so he can get some work. The pressures of a husband and the wonderful bond portrayed between the father and son throughout the movie is simply to be watched and enjoyed. There are far too many subtle things , the simple admonishing of a son by the dad only to be petrified as he thinks the boy could be drowning in a river to the final scene when the little boy consoles his dad through a simple squeeze of the hand. The B&W makes the movie all the more surreal. Amazing cast and a must watch movie that reiterates the simply joys of a relationship that flowers through the hardships of life. Watch, enjoy and relive a wonderful classic.",

Neo-realism is more about milieu and theme than about style though because I really liked De Sica's visuals and pace (which weren't as boring or lenghty as Rossellini's or Antonioni's).\nWhat you get to see is heartbreaking. A young father of two who was unemployed for a long time finally gets a job for which he needs a bicycle though.\n\nSo he goes straight to the pawned shop where he brought his bicycle and trades it for his bed sheets. The next day, he starts as a bill poster, but half through his first day at work he has his elementary bicycle stolen.\n\nThe rest of the film shows how he tries to get it back, as he wanders the streets of Modena accompanied by his son Bruno. Like in real life, he looks after clues and hints without getting anywhere in his search. Everytime he gets closer to the thief, he loses him as he pursues.\n\nI was really emotionally invested throughout the film, lead actor Lamberto Maggioriani's face at the end of the film will haunt you for a while and you'll most definitely will be convinced that theft is bad.\n\nNow, let's speak about the social commentary part a bit. The struggle of this one poor man represents the struggle of all poor men and the dilemma of poor men taking from each other rather than from the rich (of course, stealing from the rich isn't very ethical either). Instead of class war post-war Italy's working class took on itself, and this is what De Sica tries to criticize I guess.",

            "content": "Foreign films particularly ones that were being made during the Golden Age of Hollywood are endlessly fascinating to me, I know a lot about my own culture but I'll never get over people who do themselves the disservice of not enjoying what other cultures have to offer by refusing to watch anything with subtitles. And one country whose movie industry will always be of special interest to me is Italy and more specifically the great Italian Masters of Neo-Realism the most underrated movement in terms of influence on movies today. But while the most famous Director from the movement is undeniably Federico Fellini he actually only had a few movies that fell in the neo realism category (notably I Vitelloni) his breakthrough '54 hit La Strada despite often being lumped in with the movement actually came after the movement had died down and to the experienced viewer shows Fellini's marked departure from his neo-realist roots. No the real masters of the movement were Roberto Rossellini with his masterpiece Open City and Vittorio De Sica with his The Bicycle Thief. Some would argue today the latter more so embodies the genre with its lack of named actors, endearingly rough street shots and bleak but insanely compelling story which functions as a clear outline for bigger ideas more than a strict or complex narrative. The movie definitely stands as an under appreciated classic, and a powerful document of war torn  Fascist Italy, a deceptively simple film that holds the mirror up to the society of its day. I guess the question today must be how well did it accomplish it? The legacies of Fascist Italy as well as the techniques of the highly innovative Italian Directors of the day have now been made clear so how does the movie stack up? Is it an over looked masterwork that deserves as much fame as any Hollywood piece from the time or is it just a historical footnote that belongs in textbooks only? Let's follow that old man and take a look.\n\nOur down on his luck hero is Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) a poverty stricken man in Mussolini's Italy struggling to find consistent work to support his wife (Lianella Carell) and growing family of two kids. The job requires he have a bike to transport some materials around town and he is forced to sell the last of his valuable house hold commodities to purchase one. As can be expected from the title things go wrong and his bike is stolen while he's on the job and suddenly he finds he has one day to retrieve the bike or else his job will be given to someone else. He sets out with his son Bruno (Enzo Staiola) and some helpful neighbors to track down the criminal who stole it but the journey will be a frustrating and occasionally dark one where Bruno and Antonio will see the darker side of human behavior both in others and by the end themselves. Not to mention as is in the nature of this kind of story, their victory by retrieving the bike is far from assured.\n\nI have to say I really enjoyed The Bicycle Thief, maybe I'm just a sucker for bleak Italian dramas of wandering lost poverty stricken souls going throughout the ravaged country and featuring sleek and incredibly modern directing but something about it really appeals to me. Its feels nice, long and meaty despite clocking in at an Hour and Thirty but in the best way possible. It's surprisingly true to life and yet really entertaining and compelling all the while making one of the most mature statements on poverty and crime the art form of movies ever has. It doesn't seek to point at the ills of society and say isn't this rotten? Aren't there such bad people in the world? It instead dares to present a world in which people aren't given much of a choice but to steal in order to survive, which is something a lot of movies today would not have the courage to assert. Even the most rotten characters the father and son encounter are portrayed with compassion and humanism redeemable if nothing else than because they are part of a community who watch out for one another for better or worse.  It's so simple and yet so impossibly bold in what it's trying to say both on a literal and symbolic level and matches any Hollywood Production for sharp production quality and certainly story. The performances aren't exactly revelatory but the fact he didn't use professional actors is readily apparent by their lack of studio good looks, and bearing that in mind they're perfectly adequate especially Maggiorani as Ricci though it's a little depressing to consider they may have been acting out a tweaked version of their lives.\n\nIf you can't tell I think The Bicycle Thieves completely holds up, and I also love that the title can be translated to either Thief or Thieves which is kind of hauntingly poetic for a title once you see the ending. There's a reason Fellini is Fellini and De Sica is someone only known to well versed art house crowds but for what he's trying to accomplish De Sica makes quite the stunning feat with Bicycle. It's one of those movies that hits every note so perfectly and functions as such a perfect mirror of the society that created it, years later it proves itself to be one of the most endearing statements in cinema. It's not one that's open to much interpretation, once you get it you get it and there's really not much you can get out of it beyond that but it has replay value in showing just how perfectly a film can get a message across a lot of politically charged movies today should take note of, point out what's wrong and have an open mind in exploring its roots but don't just start pointing fingers at other people or groups for what's wrong with society there's so many more factors than that.",

Along his journey to find his bicycle, he was accompanied by his son Bruno.\n\nAs a part of neo-realist movement, this movie really reflects the poor socio-economic conditions in Italy post-WWII and how it effects their people. One thing that you could notice and really is the overall theme of the movie is how bad the unemployment rate back then. I mean, it was post-fascist era. People really struggle economically that even a bicycle was valued highly in everyday life. Bicycle really was everything for someone like Ricci because it means he could get a job, and i supposed it was a story of thousands other Italians at that time.\n\nInteresting thing about the movie is that both the lead actor who plays ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) and his son Bruno (Enzo Staiola) was, instead of professional actors, literally snatched out of the street to be casted in order to give a certain credibility towards this movie and how it supposed to portray the struggle of everyday working men like ricci. As a new actors, i feel like they have a great chemistry. The best scenes out of this movie usually the one that involves the two of them and how they interact towards each other.\n\nWe could see at the end of the film that this movie was trying to send some kinda message that was very often found in any other italian neo-realist movies. It tried to set aside the idea of moral judgement in everyday life, because everybody must have certain reasons behind their conducts. In this case, people stole bicycle because they need to feed their family\u00e2\u00a6.i guess..?\n\nTo be perfectly honest i was expecting to be bored just by reading the movie summary. I mean, it\u00e2(TM)s a movie about a guy who tries to find his stolen bicylcle! a bicycle ! now that seems dull. But then again i didn\u00e2(TM)t know anything about neo-realist movie or even italian socio-economic conditions in that era before any of this. I wasn\u00e2(TM)t exactly jumping on and off out of my chair, but i did enjoy the movie. It is educational and moving. I would definitely recommend you to watch it, specially if you consider yourself a cinephile!",

The power of this theme comes from the consequences of desperation, specifically the dramatic loss of honor that seems so inevitably tied to it.  It's this universal emotion that allows Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves to remain so consistently effecting.  The story is simple, and not at all burdened with multiple dilemmas.  Just one: survive.  Survive for family, survive for honor, just survive.  Because this, more than anything else, is the point of existence.\n\nAntonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) is another gaunt face in the crowd of post-war Italy and one of those destitute souls who lines up every morning with the hope of gaining employment.  It doesn't matter what or where, these men have mouths to feed.  When Antonio's name is finally called and he's offered a position as a poster hanger, a position which requires the ownership of a bike, Antonio and his wife choose to sell their bed sheets rather than pass on the opportunity.  Getting this job should change everything for Antonio, and how readily he devotes himself to the work is heartbreaking.  This is not a man with any ambition other than to do something. On his first morning of work Antonio's bike is stolen suddenly and without warning, and for the remainder of the film he searches, with the help of his son Bruno (Enzo Staiola).  Rome becomes a maze, with rows and rows of black and white bicycles and men who can't be trusted.  Father and son walk for what feels like days and the search is barren.  Even when Antonio does find the thief a faceless legion of comrades jump to his defense and Antonio is forced to move on with nothing to show for his only real lead.  As he and Bruno walk away from their search, truly and finally broken, they come upon the sight of hundreds and hundreds of bicycles left unattended.  This is the most transcendent moment in the film, in which Antonio must look inward and determine if he can perpetrate the same crime that brought him to this lowest of places.  To say simply that Antonio must decide whether or not to steal a bicycle does nothing to express the weight of his decision, which is massive.  This moment expresses so beautifully the struggle of all men in hard situations.  Men who must determine their own worth and look hard at the things they're capable of doing.  And not only that, but the pain that comes in seeing your own child recognize your vulnerability, your potential for wickedness, this is purely devastating.  It's a natural conclusion to a film that never promises a happy ending.\n\nLamberto Maggiorani wasn't an actor.  He was a factory worker discovered by De Sica for this film.  The same is true for little Enzo Staiola, who was cast purely for his bouncing gait.  De Sica felt so strongly about the purity of reality he chose not to cast actors, a decision few would disagree with years later.  In the reality of this desperation the characters thrive and become universal.  And Antonio Ricci is not a purely altruistic character.  He can act selfishly, and his relationship with Bruno seems less father/son and more a misguided partnership, with Bruno the only scapegoat for Antonio's misplaced frustration.  These two make their way through De Sica's battered story with the grace of professional actors, but for all the shattered hope required of Antonio and his son, the unaffected performance of two newcomers makes all the sense in the world.\n\nAnd the world created by De Sica is claustrophobic and callous.  No one is on the side of the Ricci family, and being their own advocates is a terribly hopeless venture.  These streets go on for hours and the sneering faces seem endless, all betting on Antonio's failure.  What is remarkable is how thoroughly we buy into the desperation and accept it.  If occasionally we remind ourselves that the cause of all this strife is just a bike, it doesn't do anything to assuage the grief we feel at every wrong turn.  De Sica has taken something mundane and made it catastrophic, which speaks so strongly to the times.  We may be in a recession, but our fears aren't of starvation, they're of not having cable.  For these people, in this time, destitution was authentic, and the torment over a stolen bike wasn't a dramatization, but a severe reality.\n\nWhile the simplicity of the story is mostly elegant, it can give way to some rather monotonous scenes.  Often De Sica will approach a scene with the hope of building tension slowly and end up simply being repetitive, for example in the moment when Antonio finally tracks down his thief.  The young man is surrounded by neighbors, all of whom vouch for his innocence, and Antonio's only argument is more or less, \"I know it was him!\" The scene resonates immediately, because it becomes so quickly apparent that Antonio's accusation will get him nowhere.  But this continues for several minutes, and there's no more depth to the exchange than \"You did this!\" and \"No I didn't!\" The film contains an abundance of these exchanges, and after awhile they become less tense and more tedious.\n\nBicycle Thieves is one of those rare cases where I was lucky enough to view the film with absolutely no expectations.  I knew the title (which incidentally, I had wrong.  The Bicycle Thief is an Americanized version of the Italian Ladri di Biciclette which is in fact plural: Bicycle Thieves. An interesting discrepancy considering Antonio's personal character arch.) as well as the film's status as a \"classic.\"  For all I knew the film could have been a lighthearted comedy.  What makes this rare instance of having no expectation so special is that the film becomes a singular and self-contained experience.  Because I haven't seen a trailer, or read up on the plot, or even discussed the film with anyone, I form an opinion of this film that is stronger and truer for it's purity.  It's an exciting moment and one that seems, in these days where we have on-set cell phone pictures and teaser trailers a year and a half before the film's release, rarer and rarer.  It makes me excited to watch more classic films; films from different eras with different sensibilities and different goals.  Bicycle Thieves may not be the best film I ever see, but for me it will always retain the beauty of a moment when I experienced something entirely on my own terms.",

After all, I did enjoy it anyway.  It's anti-climatic, it's not a movie that makes you happy, and you may not say it's a good movie with the an up beat tone. However, that movie is not suppose to have any of these things.  It really gives people an idea of how bad life was for people in Italy after World War II.  Life was so hard, one bicycle alone could make a difference as to whether or no you had a job.  I thought it was smart to use a non-professional actor for this movie and instead hire someone from the actual working class in Italy because it really added to the realism (I also found it ironic that Lamberto Maggiorani was unable to get a job after this movie and wound up having to make a living through acting).  I like how this movie never really builds up climatically because that also adds to the realism.  In real life, sometimes you can try as hard as possible, but it winds up going nowhere.  One part that I thought that was odd was how Ricci did not get any witnesses' names and how he is not able to stop the thief that steals his bicycle, but he immediately gets caught trying to steal one himself.  However, to bash this movie for that reason alone would just be overly sensitive.  It may not be the kind of movie I normally watch, but for the kind of movie that it is, it is really good.",

The film comes from the neo-realist director Vittorio DeSica and stars Lamberto Maggiorani as Antonio Ricci, a down on his luck man who has no job in a post-war Italy. Fortunately, one day he finally has a job, but he must have a bike to do it. So, he gets it out of the shop after paying for its repairs by selling his bedsheets to have it. However, on his first day, he comes into bad luck when somebody steals his bike. Knowing that without it, it could put his family at risk financially, he sets out with his son, Bruno, to find it. The entire film is enjoyable to watch, however it does hit that occasional dull spot. What I really liked best in the film was the ending, in which it takes a realistic turn on how a film like this would end, rather than the sugar-coated happy ending. I highly recommend people to see this film, whether you're young or old. It's a film worth seeing.",

This film, much like De Sica's \"Umberto D.\" allows us to be so down to earth, but never let us inside the character's head. However, \"Bicycle Thieves\" brings us so much more down to earth, and the depths of poor society. Many modern films try to make a mixture and hope it turns into a masterwork, which there isn't anything wrong with that at all, but it only proves that the TRUE greatest films have already been made. The films (certain ones) back in the early years of cinema are the pure breeds. The ones that make strong realizations to their goal. \"The Bicycle Thieves\" is one of them, and certainly one of the greater ones. Note it certainly takes more understanding to fully grasp the greater elements of the film.\n   \n   Antonio Ricci, to me, feels equally as much as a symbol, and as a singular man. Antonio is constantly ignored and treated as an unimportant existence. But when he finally is the center of attention, he continues to mistreated and misunderstood. It's painfully truthful. He is just a simple human being. Also, Maggiorani has the perfect acting style, and face to perfectly pull off the role.\n   \n   I'm not sure how others feel, but I found this film to be consistently gorgeous. The foreground always stays on-track to the focus, but the background is where the beauty really is. The camera is truly is mastered. Probably the greatest and most meaningful scene is where Antonio thinks his son has drowned, only to find out it was somebody else. He turns around, and sees Bruno at the top of the stairs in that BEAUTIFUL shot. It's a very refreshing, and a brilliant moment of realization for Antonio. It was unnecessary, but that just makes it that much more admirable.\n   \n   Though the fact that this film is a masterpiece is no secret, it still surprises with how enduring the film is. It is on many greatest films lists, and is still recognized to this day The life of this film will not soon die out.",

When Ricci find's out what his wife is doing he goes up to see her, leaving his bicycle in the doorway and asking a young boy to watch it. My immediate reaction upon seeing this was that the bicycle would be stolen here, I thought to myself, \"how predictable\". But then, as Ricci and his wife walk back down the stairway and the doorway comes back into the frame, I see that the bicycle is still there. Then it dawned on me: The only reason I thought the bike might get stolen in the first place was because of the film's title, De Sicca had used the title of his film to make the scene suspenseful! It was at that moment that the film had me hooked.\r\nThe brilliance of Bicycle Thieves lies in its simple yet relatable story. Following the precepts of Italian neo-realist movement, began by Roberto Rossellini, De Sicca filmed it on location and used only untrained actors. The realistic tone of the film helps to ground it and make it more relatable. This is not a story about superhuman heroics, it doesn't feature any crime lords, fairy tale lands, or over the top violence. It's simply a story about a man who needs a bicycle to support his family and loses it. Yet it's so compelling. That's the power of cinema, and that's why I love Bicycle Thieves.",

It's a simple, perfect story that is gripping all the way through and beautiful to look at in every shot.\n\nIn post war Rome, a the patriarch of a poverty stricken family gets a job that requires a bicycle.  On the first day on the job, the bike is stolen and Dad and his 8 year old son Bruno try to look for the culprit, which is a needle in the haystack of Rome's mean streets.  On their search, they encounter homeless men in a church soup kitchen, a brothel, and a restaurant where the father and son are looked down on by snooty rich folks.  That's it.  \n\nThe complexity is contained in the father/son relationship, which is loving, but presented with no sentimentality.  The father is so obsessed with finding the bike, that he ignores his son, impatiently hits him, and comes dangerously  close to losing him numerous times.  He learns his lesson and reprioritizes in the end when his son becomes his savior and redeemer. \n\nThe roles are filled by non actors. De Sica gets terrific performances out of all of them, especially the little round faced son.  Though considered one of the landmarks of Italian neo-realism, this film does not feel like a  gritty documentary. The shots are superbly composed, the film uses dramatic camera moves, including dolly shots, as well as a staged rain storm. The movement of people through the film is seamless and organic, yet almost balletic.\n\nThe film is generous to all its characters, no one is a bad guy, they're all just rying to survive.   \n\n I don't think I could ever get sick of this film.  Its qualities have transcended the slightly Marxist intentions of its filmmakers and its setting to become something universal and timeless.   The new Criterion collection remaster looks spectacular and nothing less should be screened.  Enjoy.",

            "content": "Probably the most constantly used phrase to describe this film is that it's a pioneer of the Italian neo-realist movement. Bicycle Thieves is a great film. A man who is desperately struggling for work is finally offered a job. His bicycle is an essential piece of equipment in order to be given the job. Then, after a short while, as the title makes inevitable, his bicycle is stolen. He and his son roam around the city, searching for the key to his livelihood, and the ending is absolutely brilliant. It is pretty widely acknowledged how great this film is, but the only argument someone could possibly try to present this flm is that the ending is very abrupt. I however don't even think this is valid, as the whole idea of Italian Neo-Realism is to get rid of these unrealistic ideas of the film going out with a bang, and making the audience forget that life does simply go on.",

            "content": "Bicycle Thieves is very powerful, beginning with the first scene. Filmed as a contemporary movie in 1948, it opens with 100 men waiting anxiously to see if there is work for them that day. The atmosphere is bleak. The employer calls out ?Ricci!? and Antonio Ricci is the happiest man alive. The catch: the job requires a bicycle. Hoping he can think of a way to get bicycle out of the pawn shop, and refusing to wait another year for work, he tells the man that yes, he does have a bicycle and when can he start work?\r\n\r\nBy the time he gets home, he still has not figured out a way to come up with money to reclaim the bicycle. Distraught, he tells his wife Maria that he has a job, but can?t take it. She is a young, pretty woman aged by the enduring struggle to keep the family of four alive. She immediately begins to strip the sheets off the bed and wash them. Antonio and Maria bring them to a man who buys odd things people sell for food money. They get just enough money for the bicycle and get it out of hock. The despair vanishes and they merrily ride away.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Antonio is at his new job. He?s standing a few rungs up on a ladder hanging a poster of Rita Hayworth (such irony) with his bicycle next to him. Like lightning, a thief steals the bicycle. Charging after him, Antonio cannot catch him. NO! How can his luck take such a turn?!\r\n\r\nAntonio and his 9-year-old son Bruno (who steals the show) decide that all they can do is search the city for the bicycle or the thief. Success is just out of reach more than once and our emotions are on a rollercoaster along with the frightened pair.\r\n\r\nThis film is a classic example of the neorealist film movement popular at the time. Shooting was on location using little-known or non-actors and depicted the bitter reality of life in those days, making dramatic social/political comments. The poverty and desperation are underscored by the crowd of men begging for jobs day after day and the fact that people are selling their sheets to live. The beautiful soundtrack by Alessandro Cicognini, which won awards in Italy, was a great part of the success in making us care so much about these characters.\r\n\r\nBicycle Thieves won an Academy Award in 1949 for as the most outstanding foreign language film released in the United States during 1949. This film is not for everybody, but if you are familiar with or a fan of the director Vittorio de Sica, I recommend you see it and I give it a 9  1/2. If you?re reading this review that?s probably the case. Otherwise, I would suggest you skip it.",
