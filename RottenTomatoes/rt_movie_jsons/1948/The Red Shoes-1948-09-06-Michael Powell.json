            "content": "An All Time Classic. The highlight of this is the incredible cinematography which is amazingly shot, lavish, and filled with memorable sets and locales. The 20 minute Red Shoe dance sequence is one of the best scenes in any film I have ever seen. It is so imaginative, eye popping and visually stunning things I've ever seen. The music is phenomenal as well with incredible dancing to go along with it. The editing is masterfully done with creative transitions and especially the work in the 20 minute dance scene is amazing. The pacing is very well done also, the one knock is sometimes it can meander for a bit in the first half but it is without a question worth it to get to the dance sequence and the story after as well. A great and interesting plot. Everyone should give this a try.",

They don't make like this anymore. This also succeeded to depict psychaological drama and conflict in performing arts industry. It's old but definitely must watch.",

The Red Shoes is lavish in it's display of ballet and the characters within the world and remains one of the greatest films of dance in cinema.",

            "content": "It is somewhat curious how the mystique of red shoes works in popular myth but it is also interesting that it is always related to women almost in general.\n\nRed is fire, blood, heat, romance, passion, youth, beauty and emotion. But there is also danger and danger and even street signs represent a complete stop.\n\nDirectors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger used the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale \"The Red Shoes\" written in 1845 to make and retell the same story in 1948 in the film of the same name in ballet form and in the drama of the three main characters. .\n\nBoris Lermontov (the always excellent Anton Walbrook more than perfect in this film) is a hugely successful manager from a Classic Ballet Company with a passion for music and dance that expresses itself in his persona and eccentricities as well as a methodical and calculating man.\n\nIn the first performance of the Ballet Lermontov film we are introduced to the three central characters besides Boris. They are Vicky Page (the beautiful Moira Shearer, who studied ballet and appears here in her first film) and music student Julian Craster (Marius Goring) who leaves the performance believing that her music had been plagiarized by her teacher and author of the music of the piece. After the performance Boris is introduced to Vicky and Vicky invites her to one of his rehearsals.\n\nJulian then writes a letter to Lermontov telling the circumstances of the plagiarism of his composition. Even though he regrets having written the letter, he falls into the hands of Boris who challenges the young man to play something of his original authorship and, impressed, hires Julian to join his company as a repetiteur.\n\nAnd during the rehearsals that Julian discreetly approaches Vicky and Boris while watching Vicky dancing, he begins to think about a new ballet piece having as a prima ballerina Vicky and this piece will be The Red Shoes with music by Julian. With the resounding success of the new ballet the company further solidifies its prestige. Vicky secretly falls in love with Julian without Boris' knowledge.\n\nI think you can imagine what would happen when Boris discovered the romance unfolding behind his back. At this point the characters converge in secrets, plots and dangerous relationships that are always represented in the brilliant cinematography of Jack Cardiff that always highlights and expresses the color red during the film. Very few times in history have colors been used in such a participative way in a drama like this. The Technicolor process is super advanced and the camera in which this film was used was simply colossal and very heavy.\n\nBut the work that in this case has to be highlighted and the restoration team that in 2009 achieved what was perhaps impossible at the time to correct the defects of the original print and the 4K high resolution scan makes today we watch this movie with an infinite image superior even in relation to the time this film opened in theaters in 1948.\n\nTo return to the central story found in Christian Andersen's fable all these factors in which the character Vicky who wants to be famous and loves dance finds herself in an intrigue in which she will have to choose between the career she loves so much with Ballet and stay with Boris, or the love of her life and decide for Julian. In the fable, shoes are what they possess and seduce the afflicted young woman who cannot resist the temptation to wear and show off with such a seductive gift. So I would say that the film is about the main protagonist's stubbornness, her vanities and the illusion in which she thinks or assumes that she controls everything around her when in fact she is being manipulated and reacting against her will.\n\nAnd for us as an audience we can only live all these emotions through an absolutely wonderful film scripted in cinematography and music of supreme quality in a work of art in vibrant and intense Technicolor.",

What holds this film together so well despite its age is the perfect balance between good quality creative screen ballet (with a fantastic original score), and a powerful tragic plot, supported with very good performances. The technicolour also helps. The struggle between art and life brought me back to Thomas Mann, but what made this version so effective was seeing the fatal flaw behind  Lermontov unfold: the character who represents, and in the end enforces, the choice of sacrificing love to art, is moved by vanity, greed and jealousy (a memorable performance by Walbrook). Paradoxically, the genuine artist chooses life, and suffers for it.",

Oftentimes, this is due to narrative or character that is simply just too despondent or morose to bring up as a top contender on family movie night (Schindler's List, Sansho the Bailiff), but some just don't tickle your fancy; for me, The Red Shoes is one of the latter. The film seems to be a slightly improved version of The Great Ziegfeld, retaining some of its fundamental structural problems - immensely impressively choreographed dance setpieces form the core and most substantial scenes, while the story constructed around it just feels lackluster by comparison. The themes around art as suffering and its role in happiness feel only partially realized (Black Swan would do this in ballet far better) and much of the acting seems over-the-top in some of the supposedly climactic later scenes. Quite frankly, I don't care for it, but I can recognize the incredible technical accomplishment in its production. (3.5/5)",

            "content": "A picture about the magic of dance and filmmaking.\n\nMichael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's musical ballet drama The Red Shoes (1948) is an enchanting dreamscape of ballet imagery and saddening depictions of the lonely life of a performer. The Red Shoes is split in between dramatic scenes of conversations between artists and their directors, then there are the dance sequences that play out as straight ballet numbers with fascinating direction and editing. Powell and Pressburger adapt Hans Christian Anderson's fairytale into a surprisingly modern script of a woman in the entertainment industry conflicted over how to be successful.\n\nPowell's direction is pure cinema as he grips you with realistic human drama with a girl destined to dance, but who desires love as well. Powell's direction is stunningly beautiful and endlessly creative. I have no idea how he got so many extras, sets, and moving parts to come together to build such romantic clockwork for this feature film. Jack Cardiff's cinematography is brilliant with striking imagery and swift camera movement everywhere to keep up with the dances and conversations alike. Reginald Mills' editing is groundbreaking as he splices together all kinds of footage with every trick in the book to keep the momentum in order to keep The Red Shoes' 133 minute run-time a fast paced experience.\n\nHein Heckroth and Arthur Lawson's production design is complex and riveting as they craft magical fantasy sets in each scene. You never quite know where to look with their wonderfully mesmerizing set decorations. Brian Easdale's score is hypnotic as the main melody to The Red Shoes ballet chimes in, you are taken away to another world every time. Hein Heckroth's costumes are delightful and colorful with many variations so that you are constantly dazzled by the outfits in The Red Shoes. I adore George Blackler, Eric Carter, and Ernest Gasser's make-up for The Red Shoes. The face paint used for the leading lady is just striking and very pretty.\n\nMoira Shearer's lead actress performance as prima ballerina Victoria Page is the greatest dancing in any film. Her effortless ballet dancing is fast, intricate, and captivating. She bares her soul and gives herself to the delicate movements of the dance. She delivers unreal ballet dancing with such ladylike flourishes and frequent challenging moves, so that you will forget her in The Red Shoes. Her dramatic acting is as impressive in The Red Shoes as her breathtaking dancing.\n\nAdolf Wohlbrück captures the ultimate toxic male as Boris Lermontov. His stage presence is undeniable and every word bears a gravitas and sincerity. He makes you believe his character could be so cruel and unfeeling. All there is is dancing for Boris and Adolf Wohlbrück convinces you of his resolve. Marius Goring is fantastic as composer Julian Craster with his serious dedication to musical composition and conduction. He has a nice chemistry with Shearer. You can believe in their romance, but Goring also conveys how obsessed Craster is with his work, so much so, that Craster ignores Page's own career goals so that you might assert his own whims upon her. Craster is a kind and sympathetic character that reveals himself to be just as selfish as Lermontov.\n\nI really enjoyed Léonide Massine and Robert Helpmann as the tough dance choreographers and performers alongside Shearer. Their performances are as complex and intriguing in their own right.\n\nIn short, The Red Shoes is movie magic. The massive dance number in the middle goes on and on with endless creative choices and captives you every second. Look out for the full performance of The Red Shoes.",

First and foremost, all the musical numbers are purely elegant. The choreography is beautifully weaved out into the narration fluently. Along with that, it too is performed lethally with co ordination like mirrors not only to the fellow performers but to the background score too. Dipped entirely into the abstractness of the fame and unquenching thirst for the art, these \"red shoes\" puts you into the spot as the concept of the feature itself is the host that welcomes you with open arms.\n\nBut as far as storytelling is concerned, this slow pill is definitely effective as the final product, but as the procedure ages on screen, the sloppy writing fails to withhold the audience with its voice. The primary reason why the drama is left out dry and numb and fails to create the anticipated impact is due to its inability to project a wider range allegory. Since whenever it attempts to be poised, mellow and extra sweetening, the makers have its tactics right under their sleeves on demand. But when the storyline gets dark and dirty and it requires a bit ruggedness, the makers seems to hesitate and are afraid to get their hands dirty.\n\nUnfortunately, it also is short handed on performance, neither the lead cast nor the supporting ones are good enough to stand on merit. As much as plausible Shearer's talent as a dancer is, she fails to fabricate the affection and guilt expressively. Walbrook and Goring to falls under the same trap due to a non-effective portrayals especially at the peak of their moments. The Red Shoes is a symphony that can only be hymned to the razzle dazzle that Hollywood does on large scale, for the plot has very little skin in the game.",

All I had known about this movie before watching is that it's hailed as one of the best-looking movies ever, and I couldn't agree more. This movie was shot in three-strip Technicolor, and it doesn't just look good for its time, but it dazzles and mesmerizes as if it was shot this year! It is simply one of the most beautiful movies to date. \n\nThe Red Shoes is a visual carnival full with vibrant, and consistent colors that will easily captivate you as well as its characters. From the first scene I could see that the characters would be fully fleshed-out at the end of the movie. Powell and Pressburger's screenplay, who also directed the movie, gave our three main characters a lot of depth that they can be analyzed, while also balancing between them, and that by making them equally important to the main plot. Each one of the main characters has their own subplots, but I never felt there's a subplot that seems forced, or outbalance another. That wouldn't be achieved without the impeccable direction that walks a thin line between quirkiness and darkness. \n \nThe theatrical performances are completely intentional. They make me feel uneasy because the subject matter is so dark and serious. These contradictory moods made the movie painful and disturbing in its own way. Maybe in a way that kinda resembles dark comedies. You'll know that such decision is appropriate when the credits roll. You'll get a very agonizing and maddening feeling! \n\nAnton Walbrook delivered one of the best over-the-top performances ever as Boris Lermontov, a very complex, and compelling character that is hard to be understood.\nThe only hammy performance that I couldn't stand is Ludmilla Tchérina's. What a highly melodramatic! It's really unbearable and annoying. Between all the theatrical performances, this just feels off, and awkward.   \nMarius Goring and Moira Shearer gave fantastic and appealing  performances. \nGrischa, played by Leonide Massine, was such a very interesting character; he is the comic-relief, but it's a character that seems if it is came out of a literary work. It made me see all the other characters differently. I saw them as I saw Grischa; fictional literary characters, and it really made sense! Grischa was the key that made me see how Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger blur the barriers between cinema and literature, or theater, in a very smooth way. \n\nPowell and Pressburger proved that cinema is a real magic, and \"The Red Shoes\" ballet sequence is more than a fine example. I won't be exaggerate, even a little bit, if I said that this 15-min-long sequence is one of, if not the most enthralling and spellbinding sequences ever shot! 15 minutes of visual storytelling at its best. I was just hypnotized, and I wish it would never end. \n\nThe Red Shoes is also masterfully edited. In fact, the editing is one of the main reasons this movie is timeless. The switching between one scene to another is very slick and smooth; however, there are many continuity editing glaring errors. Despite how simple this issue seems, I found that it's so obvious, and quite annoying, that I can't avoid mentioning it. \n\nAll I can say is that The Red Shoes is an idiosyncratic piece of work that will never age.\n\n(9/10)",

What sets the film apart, however, is the actual production of the ballet, which directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger give us in a visually stunning extended sequence, using various film effects to enhance its dreamy feeling.  You don't have to be a lover of ballet to appreciate the artistic beauty of these scenes, and it's no wonder the film won Oscars for Best Art Direction and Best Score.  Shearer being asked to choose between a husband and a career may be a little maddening and sound familiar to women, but the demand is not from her husband, it's from her producer.  The ballet shoes that she puts on which promise worldwide fame are a bit of a Faustian bargain, with Walbrook's character Mephistopheles.

He's giving an opportunity to all these young people and seems to be a pretty wise person. The very flamboyant and French lead dancer coach is pretty funny. Very smart of Victoria to wear very short and tight leggings that show off her nice ass, and my what a wonderful and fit one it is. That'll definitely get her noticed. It's really cool seeing both Victoria and Julian's beginnings and struggles as they join Lermontov's production. Seeing how ambitious and passionate they are to make a name for themselves is quite inspiring. It's interesting how Lermontov keeps testing Victoria. Trying to see how much love, fire, and passion she has within her. Very clever how Lermontov has a slight white pastiness to the color of his face, signifying that he is somewhat dead inside, cold and heartless. What an unexpected turnaround! I wasn't expecting Lermontov to be the villain of the movie! What a cruel, nasty and petty man Lermontov becomes when he doesn't get Victoria. As if he would know what love really is. What Victoria and Julian have is real love. \n\nHoly shit man, the first stage play that they did of The Red Shoes was amazing! The way the choreography mirrors the dancers/ actors emotions is pure poetry. I actually started tearing up out of joy because of how beautiful and perfect it was lol. Not to mention the special effects. I was completely and utterly entranced by the performance. I mean it's literally magic happening right before your eyes. It's incredible how the play starts on stage and then transforms through various hypnotic and psychedelic set pieces, almost turning into a life-like dream. A truly magical and breathtaking experience watching it all unfold. This movie was way ahead of it's time with how experimental it is, especially with its special effects and set piece ideas. It's hard to believe that this movie came out in 1948!\n\nIt's crazy how The Red Shoes ballet ends up becoming Victoria's life, she ends up living it. Quite the hard hitting and dark ending. Lermontov was the one that pushed Victoria too far, he was the one that ended up ruining her dance career because of his jealousy and pettiness. In a way, Lermontov represents the shoemaker int he ballet. The one who entices, manipulates and ends up killing the girl in the end. I think it's brilliant how they made the ballet and their lives sort of mirror each other. I can't imagine how painful it must be to have to pick either love for someone or a love of art. It would literally break and tear apart anyone. That moment during the ending when Victoria is having a breakdown and is torn between who to pick was unexpectedly terrifying. It caught me off guard the horror movie elements that were used during the scene to emphasize how horrific the whole experience would feel if one were to be in her shoes - her red shoes that is. \n\nUndoubtedly one of the best movies ever made about having to choose between love and art. A movie about obsession, temptation and a love for art. Brilliantly written, wonderfully orchestrated and masterfully executed. It's no wonder that it's been cited as one of the best movies ever made by many film makers. Exquisite set pieces and gorgeous film locations fill the screen. Moira Sheerer was phenomenal in this movie both with her acting but even more so with her ballet dancing. She was magical to watch, like a unicorn flying majestically through the sky. All in all, this movie is a magical masterpiece and one that should be watched at least once before you die.",

But the director of the ballet believes that they must choose between their art and love. It's a story that might have some familiar elements, but what won't be familiar to most viewers is the way the entire movie stops in order to present an actual ballet. This sequence was so remarkable and engaging that I couldn't look away. The choreography and the overall performance of the dancers was top-notch, but what really blew me away was the choice the director made to shift back-and-forth from the reality of the ballet that is being performed to the fantasy of the story within that ballet. It helps us as viewers connect the dots in order to see that Victoria is actually living out the story of the ballet. It is a truly stunning performance, and even if you have no interest in the movie, I'd still recommend watching the ballet section.\n\nIt's worth noting that the way The Red Shoes was filmed is absolutely remarkable. They used a technique called 3-Strip Technicolor and it produces some of the most striking hues I've seen captured on film. The story does frustrate me at times, but I think that's only because I was so heartily invested in the characters. By the end, despite some foreshadowing that couldn't have been more obvious, I was still quite surprised with where the movie went. It was a really impactful film, and definitely holds up more than 65 years later. The acting was all great, I particularly loved Anton Walbrook. He offered such a bold characterization and really committed to every aspect of Lermontov's personality. I'm struggling to find anything that I can really complain about in The Red Shoes. It was a surprisingly delightful movie. I doubt I would revisit it with any regularity, because it isn't exactly the most joyous film, but I'd gladly experience it again because it was simply beautiful.",

The first time I watched it, I remember being enjoyed by it but I never could grasp why but during my subsequent viewing I started to understand it's appeal.\n\nThe Red Shoes is a fairy tale written by Hans Christian Andersen. The Red Shoes is a notable work from him but it is not as well known as The Little Mermaid. The story was adapted to the screen by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. Coming into this, one might think that we would be watching a tight adaptation of Andersen's story but instead the screenwriters have created something even better, a fairy tale come to life. The film plays like a tug of war of love and art, with our protagonist deciding which she must follow. Powell and Pressburger never allows the film to be biased, instead it keeps itself distant and let the audience decide for themselves on what decision our protagonist should have made. The film can be seen as two halves with the former being the rise of our protagonist and the creation of the titular ballet, while the latter explores the aftermath of this event; how the ballet has affected the three characters we are closely following. The film never truly dedicates itself to Victoria, instead the film shares itself with three characters; Victoria, Boris and Julian. Powell and Pressburger was able to introduce it's characters in the first few minutes of the film, as the film didn't require complex characters. It's complexity is already found on the demonstration of the titular ballet. Victoria Page is not the most interesting of characters, but the struggles that she suffers does allow us to sympathize for her. Julian Craster on the other hand was much more fun to watch as the film was able to shine a light on his dedication and his rise in the business. I think his story was much more effective and more easier to root for, given the circumstances that happens to him at the start of the film. Boris Lermontov was, I think, the most exciting to watch as he is a character that is very dedicated to his craft and I understood why, as he has seen so many talented people and his art be tarnished by love. The film successfully kept me feeling objective throughout, having I feel like Victoria and not knowing what to decide whether I should be following my heart or my passion.\n\nThe film was directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. Both have been known as a duo and rarely heard for one to be called out without the other being mentioned. Both have worked on some notable films, like Black Narcissus and Stairway To Heaven, but The Red Shoes is where I was first introduced to their craft. I classify The Red Shoes as an arthouse dance film but I never felt that the film ever reached to a point of pretension; but if it did, it had enough story for one to follow in order to be simply engaged by it. Powell and Pressburger has created something bold here, as the film shows the audience an entire performance, or at least a fleshed out one, of The Red Shoes ballet. Normally filmmakers when making a film like this would only really show segments of the performance and focus more on the human story behind it, but the directors have successfully made a film where it is necessary to see it, as the ballet has a deep connection to the story that is presented to us, and if this would not have been seen then this film wouldn't have come off as unique. The directors were able to tell a great human story but also allow us to see their vision of the Andersen's fairy tale. The film may take it's time in revealing and focusing on it's complication but that doesn't matter when the creation of the ballet is so engaging to watch. During the performance of The Red Shoes, the directors could have chosen an easier approach in just showing us the performance in the point of view of the audience but instead it takes a more intimate approach in having us be immersed in it's story and creating a hypnotic and dreamlike atmosphere.\n\nJack Cardiff is the film's cinematographer. Cardiff's vision for this film is to make it look like a painting. He used technicolor to it's fullest with shots being very saturated and display an array of colors. When you look at the film, one can't help but be drawn to the color of the shoes, or the orange of Victoria's hair. The locations that was chosen and used for the film, were very lush in it's beauty and this was to make the most of the technology. A part of the film that Cardiff made an impact is the performance of The Red Shoes. He was able to create something hypnotic and surreal in have us feel like we are experiencing the same emotions as the dancer, and also having us feel like we are part of the dance. The cinematography wouldn't have been as great if it didn't contain great choreography. Cardiff wants to shoot as much of the dance as possible in order for us to appreciate it's art and beauty and not just be something to be dismissed.\n\nBrian Easdale is the film's composer. His score for the film is excellent as it had me feeling engaged the whole way through, though I am not sure whether which are an original composition and which are borrowed. There were moments in the film where I didn't even realise that it was on, and there were some moments where I do realise it due to it being such a presence that I can't help but be admired by it. The musical piece that was used for the performance of The Red Shoes was definitely the highlight as both sight and sound seemingly blend together to create something that is hard to forget. The film's score is grand and beautiful, it uses an orchestra and rarely a moment where it feels stripped down. I think the directors and Easdale wanted this film to be a cinematic escapism rather than something grounded and simple.\n\nThe film mainly follows three characters and they are Victoria Page, Boris Lermontov and Julian Craster. Victoria is played by Moira Shearer, and The Red Shoes is her acting debut. Before the film, she was a ballet dancer which was needed for the role in order to make the performance believable. Shearer's acting isn't a standout but it is tolerable. There are a couple of moments where she delivers a line, feeling like she was reading out from something or when she tries to convey a certain emotion and it just comes off as melodramatic and campy. The other reason that her performance sticks out, is that the other actors that she is with during scenes are much more natural and experienced. Marius Goring as Julian was interesting to watch, as he was convincing in playing a young man with talent and is just eager to show and prove it to everybody. Anton Walbrook was amazing in this, he seems to be really in touch with his character and has some sort of connection with art the same way as his character does. Therefore we can see the passion in his performance.\n\nThe Red Shoes is definitely a classic, but it definitely had stiff competition. Hamlet was the winner of that year but honestly I felt this film was just as strong as Olivier's film. The Red Shoes has a great story, wonderful cinematography supported by it's mesmerizing choreography, and it has wonderful performances from it's actors. What more needs to be said but give this film a watch, even if you see ballet as a drag.",

The film can be seen as two halves with the former being the rise of our protagonist and the creation of the titular ballet, while the latter explores the aftermath of this event; how the ballet has affected the three characters we are closely following. The film never truly dedicates itself to Victoria, instead the film shares itself with three characters; Victoria, Boris and Julian. Powell and Pressburger was able to introduce it's characters in the first few minutes of the film, as the film didn't require complex characters. It's complexity is already found on the demonstration of the titular ballet. Victoria Page is not the most interesting of characters, but the struggles that she suffers does allow us to sympathize for her. Julian Craster on the other hand was much more fun to watch as the film was able to shine a light on his dedication and his rise in the business. I think his story was much more effective and more easier to root for, given the circumstances that happens to him at the start of the film. Boris Lermontov was, I think, the most exciting to watch as he is a character that is very dedicated to his craft and I understood why, as he has seen so many talented people and his art be tarnished by love. The film successfully kept me feeling objective throughout, having I feel like Victoria and not knowing what to decide whether I should be following my heart or my passion.\n\nThe film was directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. Both have been known as a duo and rarely heard for one to be called out without the other being mentioned. Both have worked on some notable films, like Black Narcissus and Stairway To Heaven, but The Red Shoes is where I was first introduced to their craft. I classify The Red Shoes as an arthouse dance film but I never felt that the film ever reached to a point of pretension; but if it did, it had enough story for one to follow in order to be simply engaged by it. Powell and Pressburger has created something bold here, as the film shows the audience an entire performance, or at least a fleshed out one, of The Red Shoes ballet. Normally filmmakers when making a film like this would only really show segments of the performance and focus more on the human story behind it, but the directors have successfully made a film where it is necessary to see it, as the ballet has a deep connection to the story that is presented to us, and if this would not have been seen then this film wouldn't have come off as unique. The directors were able to tell a great human story but also allow us to see their vision of the Andersen's fairy tale. The film may take it's time in revealing and focusing on it's complication but that doesn't matter when the creation of the ballet is so engaging to watch. During the performance of The Red Shoes, the directors could have chosen an easier approach in just showing us the performance in the point of view of the audience but instead it takes a more intimate approach in having us be immersed in it's story and creating a hypnotic and dreamlike atmosphere.\n\nJack Cardiff is the film's cinematographer. Cardiff's vision for this film is to make it look like a painting. He used technicolor to it's fullest with shots being very saturated and display an array of colors. When you look at the film, one can't help but be drawn to the color of the shoes, or the orange of Victoria's hair. The locations that was chosen and used for the film, were very lush in it's beauty and this was to make the most of the technology. A part of the film that Cardiff made an impact is the performance of The Red Shoes. He was able to create something hypnotic and surreal in have us feel like we are experiencing the same emotions as the dancer, and also having us feel like we are part of the dance. The cinematography wouldn't have been as great if it didn't contain great choreography. Cardiff wants to shoot as much of the dance as possible in order for us to appreciate it's art and beauty and not just be something to be dismissed.\n\nBrian Easdale is the film's composer. His score for the film is excellent as it had me feeling engaged the whole way through, though I am not sure whether which are an original composition and which are borrowed. There were moments in the film where I didn't even realise that it was on, and there were some moments where I do realise it due to it being such a presence that I can't help but be admired by it. The musical piece that was used for the performance of The Red Shoes was definitely the highlight as both sight and sound seemingly blend together to create something that is hard to forget. The film's score is grand and beautiful, it uses an orchestra and rarely a moment where it feels stripped down. I think the directors and Easdale wanted this film to be a cinematic escapism rather than something grounded and simple.\n\nThe film mainly follows three characters and they are Victoria Page, Boris Lermontov and Julian Craster. Victoria is played by Moira Shearer, and The Red Shoes is her acting debut. Before the film, she was a ballet dancer which was needed for the role in order to make the performance believable. Shearer's acting isn't a standout but it is tolerable. There are a couple of moments where she delivers a line, feeling like she was reading out from something or when she tries to convey a certain emotion and it just comes off as melodramatic and campy. The other reason that her performance sticks out, is that the other actors that she is with during scenes are much more natural and experienced. Marius Goring as Julian was interesting to watch, as he was convincing in playing a young man with talent and is just eager to show and prove it to everybody. Anton Walbrook was amazing in this, he seems to be really in touch with his character and has some sort of connection with art the same way as his character does. Therefore we can see the passion in his performance.\n\nThe Red Shoes is definitely a classic, but it definitely had stiff competition. Hamlet was the winner of that year but honestly I felt this film was just as strong as Olivier's film. The Red Shoes has a great story, wonderful cinematography supported by it's mesmerizing choreography, and it has wonderful performances from it's actors. What more needs to be said but give this film a watch, even if you see ballet as a drag.",

Should life be lived in pursuit of aesthetic beauty, or should we seek a more visceral experience in the arms of love? Bizarrely, watching it feels like actually going to see a ballet- with extended scenes from various ones, including the one in the title. It's a modern fairytale cleverly echoing the one of the title that obviously inspired Black Swan, but unlike that film this one firmly avoids camp, unintentional or otherwise, and is all the better for it. Moira Shearer is a convincing ballerina and once again Anton Walbrook shines as a man obsessed by his passion to the exclusion of everything else. Despite all this wonder, it's far from perfect, and I thought the ending a little silly, to be honest. I suppose it was a film of its time since now such notions of two high-profile careers being unable to coexist look curiously dated in a world of showbiz power couples. Overall though, it's very good and it's easy to see why this film is so critically praised and beloved of so many famous directors.",

Some of the blame is probably on me because I will admit a film about dancing isn't my first preference. The art direction is impressive but I felt more like an outsider rather than one who is entirely involved. I wasn't overwhelmed; to me the most impressive parts of the film are mere glimpses, close-up shots where the characters are in distress, those captivated me entirely. I liked the three leading actors: Moira Shearer, Anton Walbrook, and Marius Goring. Although I knew it was coming I had a greater interest in the last forty-five minutes because we reach a climax of the relationship between the three leading characters.

Through a harmony of visual and aural elements, the British filmmaking partners known as The Archers embrace ballet as an unlikely component in their cinema; and through their conception, one of the most beautiful and meaningful of all films, they affirm that all art exists on analogous terms. From The Red Shoes springs the spirit of art in both its narrative and technical composition, signifying Powell and Pressburger's desire to coordinate all cinematic devices to express creative unity in front of, and therefore behind, the camera...\r\n\r\nRead the full article:\r\nhttp://www.deepfocusreview.com/reviews/redshoes.asp",

Is it bad that I had not heard of it before I started reading the book? Probably. You should have seen my face when I saw that it was on Netflix UK! However, enough back story, onto the film.\n\n\"The Red Shoes\" is the story of a ballet company that is going to stage a production of \"The Red Shoes\" which is based on Hans Christian Anderson's story of the same name. The composer who is contracted to compose the score is a young man by the name of Julian Craster (played by Marius Goring) who was picked to write it after writing a letter to the director of the \"Lermontov Ballet Company\" Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) about his score being unlawfully used in another production called \"Hearts of Fire\" which was staged by the Lermontov's company. Lermontov asks an unknown dancer named Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) to play the lead in \"The Red Shoes\". \n\nAfter a tremendous opening night in Monte Carlo (which is one of the greatest pieces on cinematography I have ever seen) Vicky Page and Julian Craster become big stars and go on to perform and compose in many other performances put on by the Lermontov Ballet Company. However, when love gets in the way of their work, their work (as viewed by Lermontov) becomes sloppy and an unfortunate series of events begin to unfold. \n\nFor 1948, the special effects in this film nearly beat some effects I have seen in today's cinema, especially in \"The Red Shoes\" sequence. \n\nI give \"The Red Shoes\", 5 out of 5 stars because of its unique story line and use of effects when the technology was just starting out.",

I originally saw this because I liked Black Swan and because it's one of the favorites of my favorite directer. I was expecting something good but not a master piece. It was a great combination of story telling and eye candy. By eye candy I mean the ballet scene. It was stunning and beautiful to see. It was also one of the most entertaining scenes I have ever seen. You could literally get lost and you will believe you are dreaming. If that wasn't enough for you then their still is a great story to be told and told it is. From the great acting to the great body language it still would have been a treat if it lacked the amazing dance performances. The direction was a great one. Good camera angles and good choice of pace. Of course, all classics have great pace. That is why they tend to have higher ratings then today's films. The production values are okay. They could have been better but this is from the forties. This is in technicolor so maybe that's why I don't find the production values that great. Realizing that this is in technicolor only adds to the artistic feel of the film. It's called The Red Shoes, it gives it a colorful aspect. With all the great lines and scene set ups, this has a great script. I would love to read it but I don't think I would be able to find it anywhere. If you like artistic classics then you will literally fall in love with this one.",

Released in 1948 and made by the creative team of Powell and Pressburger (whose previous successes included The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp and Black Narcissus), it's one of those cinematic experiences that, more so than not, changes or even challenges the film landscape. Everything from the performances, design, color, lighting, and narrative themes are all meticulously crafted and even (dare I say) put Powell and Pressburger's previous works to shame. While the focus is primarily a seemingly innocuous and relatively straightforward look at the behind-the-scenes workings of a ballet troupe, it also contains one of film's great set pieces: a lush and beautifully artistic ballet of the original \"The Red Shoes\" story that, on-screen, mixes fantasy with reality in a surreal production that many consider to be the finest representation of ballet in film. I just simply cannot get over the film, and I fell for it immediately. It is so striking and so worth anyone's time to view. It's definitely one of my favorite films.",

The performance of \"The Red Shoes\" which serves as a centerpiece to the film is simply one of the most impressive sequences I've ever seen. This movie also has one of my favorite cuts of all time. After announcing she is engaged to the company, a dancer notices Boris has left and says to herself he is a cruel man. We then cut to a wide shot of Boris alone in a large dark room, framed by a moonlit window. It is a stunning moment to behold. The performances are for the most part subdued and cold,but if you match the tone and subject of the text enough that they are not a distraction. I particularly thought Walbrook, who played the producer, nailed a few of his more difficult scenes. The only real problem I had with the script was the ending, which felt forced and not truthful to the character of Victoria. Definitely a must for any die hard fans of lavish productions.",

The result is a beautifully made piece which is the Black Swan (2010) of it's day. It alienated audiences in the UK, but was a huge hit in America. It's proof that they certainly don't make them like they used to. It's a multi-layered story where rising dancer Victoria 'Vicky' Page (Moira Shearer), from a posh family, wants to dance for the Ballet Lermontov, led by Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook). But he is reluctant to give Page a chance, but he goes ahead and she's taught under the companies ballet choreographer Grisha Ljubov (LÃ (C)onide Massine). Page soon finds herself falling for Julian Craster (Marius Goring), a student who became orchestral coach for the company after meeting Lermontov. Craster has composed a new ballet called The Red Shoes, based on the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. Page is to be the lead in it, but she finds herself in a love triangle between Lermontov and Craster, and it leads to her going insane. It's a well made film, but for a film around 2 hours, it still feels insubstantial. You can see why directors like Scorsese, Spielberg and De Palma like this film and how it inspired them, and Shearer plays a good femme fatale, but it's quite cold by today's standards.",

Not a one of them even PROPOSES a solution to their troubles; thus, in the end, I didn't really care what happened to them.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI had a chance to see a 35mm screening of \"The Red Shoes\" again with my teenage daughter in January, 2012. She expressed similar sentiments but I found that I liked the movie a lot more on second viewing. I found the character's actions credible in trying to accomplish their goals through much of the film and some fairly subtle but clear and amusing reactions from some of the actors (who are mostly very, very good). \n\nI found myself watching for the moment where it turns and loses my buy-in to their situation. It actually occurs only minutes before the end and didn't bother me nearly so much this time as there wasn't really much time given for manning (or womanning) up and dealing with the problem constructively before  ... well, before tragedy leaves the issue moot.",

El verdadero alcance artÃ­stico de The Red Shoes estÃ¡ en los nÃºmeros musicales y de baile. La secuencia que incluye los nÃºmeros musicales del estreno de la obra, segÃºn se dice, tomÃ³ 6 semanas filmarlas. Dicha secuencia es de un lenguaje visual soberbio y extravagante, lleno de sofisticados efectos especiales fotogrÃ¡ficos (fotomontajes, sobreimpresiones, etc.), asÃ­ como una ediciÃ³n, maquillaje y vestuario magnÃ­ficos. La pelÃ­cula de hecho ganÃ³ un Oscar a âMejor DirecciÃ³n de Arteâ y âMejor MÃºsicaâ. Algo curioso es que, mientras algunos de los sets lucÃ­an baratos y nada dignos de premio alguno, es en los escenarios de la obra donde la pelÃ­cula tiene lo mejor en su diseÃ±o de producciÃ³n.

For if they were, I would be constantly clamoring, like the youths in the first part of the film, for front row seats. Also, and I know this sounds crazy, but it will change the way you look at color films. I felt like I was a child of the 60's who just got his paws on his first color television.

            "content": "An absolute awe-inspiring triumph. The Red Shoes is one of few films that genuinely obsesses over art as vocation, art as religion, and art as the purpose of life. It's a feast for the senses (the gorgeous cinematography, shot in technicolor by Jack Cardiff, the tremendous performances, punctuated by Anton Walbrook's Boris Lermontov, the outstanding dance choreography, and the exquisite, sweeping score by Brian Easdale). It's a film that's sprawling without feeling bloated, and majestic without losing its focus. Emeric Pressburger's story appears simple at first glance, but slowly unravels as a challenging study of the value and purpose of art, and of aestheticism as a creed. I've always respected the art of ballet, but never really took much of an interest in it. It's quite astonishing, then, that I was completely engrossed by the film's 15 minute performance of \"The Red Shoes.\" The artistry of the dancing, the brisk pace, the intense storytelling, the enrapturing backdrops (however superimposed they may have been), were all absolutely riveting. \n\nClearly The Red Shoes inspired Black Swan. I contend that the latter not only owes a debt to the former, Swan owes it's entire existence to this Archers masterpiece. Not only did Aronofsky lift many of his sequences and storyboards from this film, the thematic concerns, the Bergman-esque exploration of the meaning of art, is virtually identical. \n\nThroughout the years, the term \"melodrama\" has taken on a negative connotation (thanks Douglas Sirk), but The Red Shoes implores one to recognize that melodrama is extremely powerful if handled correctly. No wonder this film is held in such high esteem, not only as a British nature treasure, but as a classic of film itself. It's one of those rare gems that reminds you of why you love the cinema.",

            "content": "Michael Powell has a knack for telling stories in an incredible way. The Red Shoes was far ahead of its time. It was more like Black Swan than I expected. The film allows the audience to become invested in the characters before the heavy conflict takes place. Victoria Page wants to be a great dancer so she wants to be in Lermontov's productions. Julian wants to be a famous composer so he tries to get in with Lermontov as well. It takes a bit of luck to get past the first stage with Lermontov. But once they work their butts off they are finally given the chance to do The Red Shoes together, which is when they truly meet for the first time. Here is when the fairytale of The Red Shoes comes into play the most. Victoria is finally dancing for Lermontov, but as the story goes, once the girl puts on the red shoes she can't stop dancing. The shoes won't let her. The production of The Red Shoes was done incredibly well. Julian explains to Victoria that his music will capture her. One piece is supposed to be set in a ballroom, and once she hears it she will suddenly be in a ballroom. When Victoria takes the stage we are just as nervous as she is. But, just as Julian says, she is taken by the music, and so are we. The production obviously doesn't have everything that we see. Perhaps he was inspired by surrealist filmmakers? Either way, this was absolutely incredible. The entire dance doesn't feel out of place simply because of the explanation by Julian in the previous scene. The scene also plays out as a cut between what was happening before and what comes after. We understand Victoria's love for dancing and how much it fuels her life. We understand that Lermontov doesn't accept when a woman loves a man instead of focusing on dance. So when he discovers the new love we know what's about to happen. But just like The Red Shoes, we know that Victoria Page can never truly stop dancing. \n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nThis is even the cause of her death. I interpret her going over the edge as the shoes not letting her stop, just like in the fairytale. The last dance with the spotlight following nobody is devastating. Lermontov says that he does this because that's what she would have wanted. Or was it? Lermontov was a selfish man. He couldn't let her be in love with the composer and have him write amazing music. He claims that Julian and Victoria were both slipping, but I think it was just jealousy. Lermontov has dedicated his life to dance and he wants his dancers to do the same. So the last dance with the spotlight following nobody is him deciding her fate once again. But as Victoria says to Julian right before he dies, she wants the shoes off. She's done dancing, and she was done when she went running out the door. Maybe life is about art, but life is also about love. She was not ready to give up love. The shoes wanted to keep dancing, but she was tired of it. This is just like how Nina follows the story of Swan Lake in the film, but The Red Shoes happens to follow the fairytale much closer. Incredible film with beautiful visuals and incredible writing.",
