    "summary": "In this classic adventure film, two rough-and-tumble wanderers, Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and Curtin (Tim Holt), meet up with a veteran prospector, Howard (Walter Huston), in Mexico and head into the Sierra Madre mountains to find gold. Although they discover treasure, they also find plenty of trouble, not only from ruthless bandits lurking in the dangerous Mexican wilderness but from their own insecurities and greed, which threaten to bring conflict at any moment.",

I can listen to the radio show version or watch the movie in the background every few years and once in a while when invited to a screening on someone's new home theater sytem I ask for this title and it's never let me down.",

This film have three characters that are all put into the position of greed. One is forever tainted, the second is mixed, while the third is pure of heart. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is such a fantastic film. The musical score composed by Max Steiner is excellent and intense at times. The acting performances by Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston, and Tim Holt are extremely incredible. The cinematography by Ted D. McCord was pretty nuanced especially the scene when Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) sleeps by the campfire as the fire rises symbolizes that he is forever corrupt. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is overall a fantastic and artistic film that gives people so much to think about.",

I feel like the characters in this movie aren't necessarily good people, and it keeps their every move interesting. That being said, it also makes it hard to root for anyone. I think it is an interesting movie but I never felt like any of the characters really deserved to win, but also I think that is the point the movie is going for. I was also very impressed by the technical elements of this movie. For a movie made in the 40s, it still holds up well and the action and adventure feel completely believable with minimal dated effects or filmmaking style choices. Overall, it is a movie with strong themes and interesting characters, with an adventure that has some merits but isn't always completely engaging because I didn't feel as invested in it as I should have.",

A draggy, disjointed plot ... are we to believe an proto-environmentalist Howard could convince Dobbs to remedy the mountain's scars as they sat on a $105,000 treasure (that's over $1.6 million in 2022) ... and Dobbs would immediately morph from sullen pain-in-the-ass to happy, eager beaver?\n\nAnd are we to suppose that Curtin, a totally broke bum, will pop up in Dallas to bring endless joy to a young widow who doesn't know him from Adam?  How about the nameless rich American in stereotypical white tropical suit who grub-staked Dobbs, just to make him go away?  Howard going off with the locals and leaving his share behind?  With Dobbs?  Laugh uproriously at a lost fortune?  Gimme a break!\n\nThis entire film succumbs to endless foreshadowing, cheesy fight scenes, child-level moralizing, and a disjointed, chaotic \"plot.\"\n\nWe love Bogart.  Why so many love \"Sierra Madre\" relies on celebrity worship and fawning over a supposed \"golden age\" in cinema.\n\nLook at any distinguished actors filmography, and you'll always find forgotten failures.

            "content": "Trust is a commodity.  So this is about two broke and down-on-their-luck Americans (Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt) in Mexico.  Money is tight, so they decide to go all in and gamble on an old prospector (Walter Huston) to find them some gold in the middle of nowhere.  As luck may have it, they find a lucrative spot.  However, when a fortune is on the line, nothing is simple.  I've always been aware of this movie's existence, but I had never taken the time before now.  All I knew about it is that many regard it as a classic, and there is that iconic line about badges.  I don't have all that much experience with the library of Humphrey Bogart other than Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon, so I figured that now was the time to rectify that.  Well, let me say that the consensus is absolutely correct.  Now perhaps it was just me not knowing what to expect, but the thing I enjoyed most about this is how this movie kept evolving.  It kept me on my toes, and I could never pinpoint how this story would unfold next.  This starts with two men who do not have any money, so when they finally get to a point where they may have a chance at having means, you can understand why they are grasping at it so tightly.  What I was not expecting this to morph into was the paranoia-fest that it becomes, and that is where this is just brilliant.  I mean really, it may not outdo it, but this rivals The Thing in how much suspicion is being passed around this group of three, and right at the center of it all is Bogart who is the shiftiest of the lot.  All three men can dish it as much as they can take it, and there isn't a weak performance in the bunch.  This could have easily fallen apart if there was, but because they all rise to the occasion, we got ourselves a film that will stand the test of time.  There aren't that many Westerns that take place in Mexico out there, and it's hard for me to imagine one that does it better than The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.  They never let you forget how treacherous and unforgiving the terrain is, not even for a minute.  Every character in this is always covered in sweat, sand, and grime, and that only adds to the atmosphere that is masterfully built.  This story is all about greed and mistrust, and everyone here nailed it.",

A morality play that touches on honor, betrayal, and greed, among other things, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is thrilling to watch, despite the fact that it hasn't aged particularly well.

            "content": "John Huston's classic adventure drama with a its dark strain of sardonic humor remains relevant as a timeless depiction of man's avarice and our obsession with the battle between good and evil. Additionally, from the 2020 lens of inclusion, here we have refreshing story in places unknown that uses Spanish speaking actors in a number of larger roles - impressive. That's part of the appeal of this picture, the grandness of the journey we go on, both outside and in. The surprise of what lays beyond the comfort of the known, and in what is likely Bogart's most powerful performance, he takes us there to the edge of sanity. While the style and presentation is a bit theatrical, the surprise in the psychological turns - as written and seen - is still satisfying. And then the ending is a monumental quencher, morally perhaps, but cinematically, surely. There is no question after seeing films like There Will Be Blood and No Country For Old Men, that this film has served as inspiration for many, and will continue to do so for years to come. When it comes to acting, Walter Huston's depiction of the older prospector is indelible. His fast talking, wise cracking, wise to the world, whirlwind of a mensch, is pure pleasure - even when you can barely understand him! The film moves at breakneck speed until it doesn't have to, at which point we fall into the spell of darkness, the inner workings of the character's hearts and minds. You can see why Huston was a natural director in this time period, creating dynamic visual palettes without eschewing what today may feel theatrical, but coming from the 1930s, felt natural. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre remains a great film and a worthwhile blockbuster hit.",

            "content": "Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston, and Tim Holt are three guys who are down on their luck and turn to prospecting for gold in a rugged part of Mexico known for its bandits.  You can practically feel the heat and sweat through the screen, and Bogart's face is covered in grime for most of the movie.  He turns in a brilliant performance, and it's right from the beginning, when he splashes water in a kid's face for harassing him about buying a lottery ticket.   \n\nWalter Huston, directed by his son John, is fantastic as well, as the experienced old man who can scale hills like a goat, and who knows human nature after having seen men around gold over his lifetime.  Bogart and Holt's characters seem so reasonable, but his words at the beginning are an omen.  The way John Huston tells the story, though, is far from simple.  Bogart's evolution through the film is intense and yet nuanced.  It could easily have become a caricature, but didn't.\n\nI had a few small criticisms, though they didn't stop me from enjoying the film.  It seemed to me that the gunfight scenes fell into old clichés, and the music was too intrusive at times.  Also, the scene of the white man reviving the native boy, much to a crowd's appreciation as if he were a savior, seems like an overdone Caucasian fantasy to me.  \n\nOn the other hand, the tight shots on the natives, as well as the frequent use of untranslated Spanish throughout the film, were fantastic.  I also loved how it was shot on location in Mexico, as that really translated in the cinematic experience.  The dialogue throughout the film is great, and it's of course famous for its line from the leader of the bandits (Alfonso Bedoya), who says \"Badges?  We ain't got no badges.  We don't need no badges!  I don't have to show you any stinkin' badges!\"  \n\nI really enjoyed some rather stark events that were rather shocking, but what really made the film for me was its commentary on humanity.  We see the inevitability of fighting over wealth play out in several ways.  We see greed become so strong that paranoia grows like a cancer in the soul.  And we see the enlightened reaction to it all, borne from having become wise with age, and that is, to understand your fellow man and laugh at life's misfortunes.",

Bogart is Dobbs and he and his friend Curtin, are two low life's that are laying around Tampico. Dobbs begs fellow Americans for money so he can get a decent meal. They get scammed out of money and have to fight and scrap to make by. They finally get a break when they get some money and decide to try their luck as gold prospectors.\n\nThey enlist Howard (Huston) to take them and help them find gold\nAs they begin to search for gold they become quite successful and start dreaming of how much to take and what they will do with all the money. They decide to split up the gold dust as they find it and each of them hides it in a separate place. When Curtin accidentally stumbles upon Dobb's hiding place Dobbs begins to lose trust in his fellow partners. They still manage to stick together as they fight off rebels, and bandits. There are some great scenes of comradely between the men, and there are many scenes of tension and darkness where I believed any one of them could have been killed. Eventually Dobb's greed and paranoia gets the best of him as he attempts to kill Curtin in cold blood while Howard is off praised for helping some natives.\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre is slow drama that gradually unfolds to those who are patient. The characters start off innocent, and you root for them to find fortune. The film depicts what can happen to a man when stricken by greed. Hobbs starts as a good man, but his transition to darkness is the film's best attribute. Huston and Holt are excellent side characters and you feel for them as they try and curtail the wrath and envy of Dobbs. They each share the burden trying to do the right thing despite Dobb's constant objections. Although none of them are completely innocent as they almost decide to kill a man in cold blood to protect their find, they all eventually get what they deserve. Great direction and great performances drive this picture in what has a pretty straight forward story. Treasure of the Sierra Madre runs a little long, but it has quite a payoff and is a great drama/adventure. \n\n-3.18.2017",

            "content": "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a brilliant film for many reasons.  It's a beautifully looking film shot on location in Mexico, a true testament to the greatness that was Humphrey Bogart, and most of all, it's an unsettling tale of what greed can do to your soul.  Out of all the characters in the movie, there are only a few that appear to have good intentions.  But even those people, are fueled by greed or rage at some point or another.  All of them go through fascinating journeys of either self-discovery or self-betrayal.  Although it's a film that takes its time with its characters and story, there isn't a moment where I felt the film's pace needed to be picked up.  That was just simply the way films were told back in the 40's.  You're always in it for the long haul with these characters, even when there doesn't seem to be much left to the main character's souls.\n\nIf I had to go through Bogart's career of award worthy performances (surprisingly, he was only nominated 3 times), his turn as Dobbs may be my favorite performance of his, and yes that includes The African Queen.  There's something to be said about him moving away from his usual gloomy and somber characters to one that completely jumps off the rails.  But it fits in with the increasingly unhinged tone of the film, so Bogart would get my vote.  He, along with John Huston's directing are why this is one of the most interesting pieces of cinema from the 40's.  It's one of the rare films with mostly unlikable characters that actually works.  That deserves some props.\n\n8.5/10",

Now I know where that line comes from-We don't need no stinkin badges-haha.",

So they go out seeking their fortune and with a little time and a lot of hard labor they are able to find the riches they seek. The only problem is they have to work together and trust one another, and greed has a strangely powerful ability to corrupt a man's mind. Of the movies I've seen I think this might be the finest performance I have ever seen from Humphrey Bogart. The way he portrays such a lovable rogue at the beginning, and then the slow descent into madness is played so remarkably well. In less capable hands I think you could look at the Dobbs from the beginning of the film and the one at the end as 2 completely different characters, but Bogart excels at showing the gradual slide in such a way that you almost feel pity for him later in the movie. The whole story in this movie takes some time to get going, there is a lot of character development stuff at the beginning that establishes the kind of guys they are so it can feel like things are dragging. But once the gold enters the equation the story is excellent. Some credit also has to go to the hair, makeup, and costume departments. Bogart's outward appearance seems to perfectly match the inward decline of his sanity, to the point where he almost looks like a wild animal by the end.\n\nI could see some people having issues with this movie. It's not the Bogie they might be expecting. He's supposed to be the hero in movies, but that falls apart here. But thankfully they do give you someone to root for in Tim Holt. His portrayal of Curtin has an edge to it, but you are given a moment where you come to find that he's going to be honorable. Of course that doesn't mean everything will turn out perfectly for him, but I've already spoiled enough of the movie, so I won't go into that. This movie is also very quotable, including the famous \"badges\" line that has been imitated more times than can be counted. That very encounter with the banditos is a unique one as well. I find it a strange contrast that they are so afraid for their lives and yet the ones they consider a threat are smiling happily at them. It seems like every scene in Treasure of the Sierra Madre is perfectly scripted. I am constantly impressed with how excellent writing was back then. They could say so much with only a few sentences, and get away with some innuendo without having to resort to coarse language. This is a good movie with some truly amazing performances that elevate the film to another level. I give it my highest recommendation to all who are interested that haven't seen it.",

Enthralling, not at all predictable and incredibly engaging.  You are lead on a continuous, unflagging, adventure, where you care what happens to the characters, but have no idea how things will turn out. \n\nHumphrey Bogart didn't get an Oscar nomination for his performance, but he deserved one.  For once he isn't necessarily a good guy, and his portrayal of Dobbs' descent into paranoia and madness are incredible to behold.  Superb performance by Bogart, and possibly his best.  Only Casablanca, and maybe The Caine Mutiny, comes close, I think.\n\nGood support from Tim Holt and Walter Huston.

The new Revolutionary government of Mexico is sending out the new Federal Police force to round up the bandits and execute them without trial when caught.  This underlying corruption of the Mexican Government has extended to today, bandits have turned into drug smugglers and the Mexican Police take bribes to allow the drug smuggling and Mexican National government has to use the Army to fight the drug smugglers.  In 1925 Mexicans and Americans could cross the border freely.  Humphrey Bogart plays an American who gets trapped in Mexico without any money to get home.  They don't explain how he got there but there was a recession in the U.S.A after the First World War.  There may have been many single men who went to Mexico to seek their fortune but fell on hard times once they got there.  The first time I heard of this movie was when Robert Blake was promoting his TV show Beretta on the Johnny Carson show.  They show the clip of him with Humphrey Bogart.

Those of you who know Humphrey Bogart as Hollywood's original charmer, you will not forget how he breaks this role in a dramatic way.

I loved the performances in this film, especially Humphrey Bogart's (probably will end up being my favourite from him; his portrayal of the paranoid, and ultimately repulsive/maniacal Fred Dobbs was just glorious to watch), and Director John Huston's father, Walter Huston, as the wisehead Howard. The junior Huston's direction & scriptwriting was very well crafted; nothing felt contrived, and he did wonderfully in pacing the story -- which I found both funny and sardonic. His cameo appearances at the beginning of the film will also go down as one of my favourites from a director (\"Can you help a fellow American down on his luck?'' -- hehe). Oh, I've read that P.T. Anderson was inspired by this film when he wrote ''There Will Be Blood,'' and I think I found a distinct comparison: there is an absence of women in both films (and I'm sure there are more, especially thematically, for example: how greed morally corrupts, and all that jazz). All in all, I really enjoyed this movie; it truly lives up to its reputation of being an American classic, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it as yet!",

It is a mesmerizing and utterly convincing performance, matched by his two on-screen partners - the quiet and sensible Curtin (Tim Holt), and the savvy, no-nonsense veteran prospector (Walter Huston, fantastic).

However, when they finally strike it rich they find it is not all it is cracked up to be . The situation escalates and they become paranoid of each other. Finally, Bogart's character Dobbs is pushed over the edge and commits a malicious act out of desperation. Seemingly as an act of karma, he meets with another form of justice.

Dobbs.  The film uses the backdrop of prospecting for gold in the mountains as a way to examine the character of men, and what they can be driven to do. Bogart's Dobbs is one of classic tragic figures in the history of film. A must see, which clearly became the template for hundreds of later films. Essential.",

            "content": "Having had his day as an idolized star and romantic leading man, Humphrey Bogart came to a crossroads in his career and decided to get down to the serious business of acting. For eighteen years it had usually been Bogart playing Bogart in various shadings, but once \"Bogey\" was gone, in his place was an older and far less romantic figure, one who found new challenges and was able to meet most of them successfully. This new phase of his continued growth began with a story of three men in search of gold, and ended up being the finest performance of his career.\n\nAlthough The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is indisputably one of Bogart's best films, it was co-star Walter Huston who won an Academy Award as did the movie's director and scenarist, the brilliant John Huston. Based on a novel by the mysterious B. Traven, the film told a riveting tale which explored the degenerative effects of encroaching greed, distrust, and hatred on three prospectors who team up to search for gold in Mexico. Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs is an amazingly complex creation whose slow disintegration into paranoia was brilliantly managed on Huston. He is a born loser with no potential for change in sight. Suspicious, unfeeling, savage, and easily corruptible, he seems clearly destined for a tragic fate almost from our first glimpse of him.\n\nHowever, it is the director's father, Walter Huston, who literally stole the picture as Howard, a wise old toothless codger who knew all along what would happen and took it all in stride, kicking up his heels and having a marvelous time. Life can't surprise him any more. He's already had successes and failures enough for one lifetime. Like a faithful dog, he's along for the thrill of the hunt, and should there be another pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, well, that's just a bonus.\n\nIt is mainly the interaction of these three men from their first meeting and uneasy partnership through their final confrontation that made The Treasure of the Sierra Madre an everlasting classic and one of Warner Brothers' triumphs of the forties...",

So no surprises or deep insights there.  The pace was incredibly slow and how many times did we have to see John Huston giving a silver dollar to Humphrey Bogart? Once please. I knew what was going to happen 30 minutes before it did and I am not a movie seer.  I admit the line \"we don't need no stinking badges\" is iconic and one that I've used gleefully.

Like all the best movies of its era, it's very well done in every aspect of its execution.\n\nThe movie follows a couple of down-on-their-luck guys (Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt) in Mexico in the 1920s who team up with a goofy old prospector (Walter Huston) to try to find gold. The movie is all about the tensions leading up to their quest for gold as well as the tensions resulting from their finding it. It's a classic story, and only makes a false step in a plot development involving the old prospector becoming a hero to a Mexican town, which seems both totally out of nowhere and vaguely racist. Still, though, it's a totally classic story.\n\nHumphrey Bogart gives one of his most effective performances here (saying a lot), and certainly the darkest one that I've seen. Bogart was always playing the tough but secretly sentimental hero, but not here. Here he's not really a hero, just the character the movie happens to follow. He's greedy and paranoid, and the movie follows his descent as these problems grow worse. Bogart looks progressively more ragged over the course of the movie, to match his deteriorating mental state. This part, for me, proves Bogart had more range than some people might be willing to give him credit for. Walter Huston, who won an Oscar as the prospector, is great, giving his character a wry sense of humor and detachment. He's one of those great scene-stealing characters. Tim Holt is a good straight man for the other two characters.\n\nApparently, as I learned, this was the first big budget Hollywood feature to be shot entirely on location, not sets (only a couple of re-shoots were done on sets). The movie makes a lot out of its locations - the characters are almost never indoors, and we feel their isolation in the wilderness as they're out prospecting. John Huston won a best director Oscar for it, beating out Olivier for Hamlet. It's that classic old Hollywood style of being visually interesting without being obtrusive. Overall, it's just a perfectly put-together movie.",

This is, without a doubt, one of the most influential adventure movies ever made (especially on the Indiana Jones series, though it's not the only influence on those). \n\nThe film concerns a couple of down and out drifters in Tampico, Mexico who join up with a wily old man to go out on a treasure hunt for gold in order to better themselves, but encounter many troubles along the way such as the elements, bandits, and most dangerous of all, themselves. This is a wonderful study of greed and paranoia, but despite the heavy and dark themes, it's done in a very light and entertaining fashion, even though it is a morality tale. \n\nShot almost entirly on location, this has some great cinematography and everything just looks fantastic, no matter how ugly things get. Max Steiner's score likewise enhances the mood and makes the already epic adventure even more so. If not for it's cautionary message, I'd say this film would be quite great at inspiring people to go out on their own adventures. \n\nAll of the above are great, but it's the acting that really seals the deal for me. Humphrey Bogart, great guy that he is, really shines in a change of pace role as the disreputable antihero Dobbs who gets increasingly paranoid and dangerous as the film progresses. Tim Holt is really good as his likeable companion Holt, but the real scene stealer is director John Huston's own father Walter as the old timer Howard who, despite predicting that toruble would ensue, goes along anyway, showing that you're never too old for an adventure. All these guys are great, but Huston was the won who walked away with an Oscar for his efforts, and he deserved it too. He's just a joy to watch.\n\nWatching this today, the film might not seem as fresh and amazing, but it is quite watchable and avery entertaining. I really dug it though, and think it holds up quite well.  Definitely give this one a shot. It's one of the greats.",

Based upon the same novel by the highly elusive and mysterious German author B. Traven, the terrific movie adaptation of THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE blends together  in a sense elements  the of adventure film with a dark observation Human Nature, especially the films core focus upon the darkest side of humanity , greed.  John Huston directed Tim Holt, his father Walter Huston (in his Oscar winning role) and the iconic Humphrey Bogart in what can be said as their greatest performances of their carriers as actors, in an unquestionable masterpiece .In the fourth review instalment of my fortnight long look at the films of Humphrey Bogart, it fills me with great pleasure to be talking about one of my new found Favourite films. THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE is today's film of Bogart that I'm taking a look at, reviewing. \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUMPHREY BOGART FORTNIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nDay Four: John Huston's THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE [1948]: Not long after the outbreak of the Second World War director John Huston was drafted into The U.S Army Signal Corps were he made several War films which were too controversial for wartime audiences to be shown. In the meantime the middle Humphrey Bogart during the War time became a huge superstar and box office favourite with classics like CASABLANCA and his on-screen -off screen romance with Lauren Bacall.  After the war Huston returned to Warner Brothers whom had been planning to adapt into a film but due complications and delays like trying to tell a story with a downbeat ending, trying to even secure the rights from the Mysterious Traven and the war had prevented it. Huston in 1946 headed for Mexico on location scouting were in the Bamer Hotel in Mexico City , Huston meet not with Traven but a man called Hal Corves who claimed to represent the author as an Attorney.\r\n\r\nWhat Huston did after securing the rights to the novel did something unheard of in Hollywood at the time; he was to shoot parts of the film on location in Mexico. At that time in 1947 it was unheard of to produce a film outside of the Studios grounds. When the shooting of the film began all throughout the production Corves, Traven's agent was present on the set of the film were the popular theory that Hal Corves was in fact B Traven began on set were the production team constantly asked Corves if he was Traven, who would franticly answer no to the question. But whatever the case with that theory, the production of the film that had worried Warner Brothers Studio for the sear cost involved boldly proclaimed in its trailers for the film that it was one of the best films that it had made. When the film hit screens the critical response (and the response from the Academy Awards) was hugely positive even though due to the films dark story and lack of romance turned off the Audiences. But thankfully today the film has since been crowed as a one of the greatest films of all time.  \r\n\r\n \r\nTHE PLOTLINE\r\n\r\nSet in Tampico, Mexico in the 1920's a down and out middle aged American Beggar called Fred. C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) tries to get by as a foreigner in a different land. When he befriends a young fellow American Beggar called Curtin (Tim Holt), the pair after being conned into working on an Oil Rig without being paid for their labour wind up in a flop house. In the home they come across and old Gold Prospector called Howard (Walter Huston) who speaks about mining for Gold all over the world and what it can do to men's souls. Fred and Curtin eventually mange to put together an expedition after the pair beat up the crooked Oil Rig Boss and winning the lottery, Fred, Curtin and Howard join forces and go in the search for gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains. \r\n\r\n \r\nIn the Mountains the group start to come across all sorts of problems when the group strike gold. The group face the possibility of losing their claim if they are ever found out , the constant risk of being attacked by Bandit's who will kill just for anything, and the high risk of the group being torn apart by paranoia. When Dobbs is nearly killed after a shaft collapses on him, he starts to become increasingly paranoid of Howard and Curtain taking his claim. One day in the local town while getting supplies Curtain comes across an American Prospector called Cody (Bruce Bennett) who quickly figures out what Curtain is up to in the mountains. After being followed back to the campsite, the group's situation change when Cody shows up and explains how they only have three choices. \r\n\r\n \r\nWhen the group decide to kill him a group of Bandits lead by outlaw that the group saw attacking their train on the way into the Mountains nicknamed Gold Hat (Alfonso Bedoya) arrive in the camp. After Dobbs confronts the Bandits which results in a gun battle which results in Cody being killed. When the federal Troops chase off the Bandits and after reading a letter from Cody's widowed wife, both Howard and Curtain start to change their attitudes about the amount of gold they need. Upon leaving the mountains after the gold vein start to run out Howard leaves the group to help a tribe of Native Indians, Curtain and the insane with greed and paranoia Dobbs are left alone with the loot. The young Curtain soon learns about the worst enemy of all, Human Nature at the hands of the paranoid Dobbs.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTHE ACTING, DIRECTION AND SCRIPTING \r\n\r\nThe acting from the main focus of this review series, Humphrey Bogart in this film is just stunning, absolutely stunning and powerful. After years of being typecast as a diabolical gangster  in numerous films in the 1930's and then as the romantic hero who learns the importance of the course he is fighting for, it's no wonder why the Studio bosses freaked when they saw a dirty Bogart in tattered clothes and as a totally horrible character. Bogart gave one hell of a performance as Fred. C. Dobbs and it's just UNTHINKABLE he never received an Academy Award nomination at least for his performance. Bogart's Dobbs starts the film as a character worthy of the audiences' pity for his state, before being shocked and terrified at his slip into madness at the hands of his increasing paranoia and greed. But that's what makes this Bogart performance so brilliant that it tops all of his iconic roles like Rick Bane, Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe in one show stopping performance. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith the performance by Walter Huston whom won an Oscar for his role in this film as Howard, well it's that good that even Bogart was honoured he lost scenes to him in this film. Walter Huston's performance as Howard has since become a pop-culture cliché of an old timer prospector, but what isn't cliché about his performance is how good it is. Although I'm disappointed that the academy never gave Bogart a nomination for his performance, at least the academy got it right with Walter Huston's performance.  He and Tim Holt's performance as Curtain onscreen portrayal of their characters are just brilliant. With the performances by the likes of Bruce Bennett as Cody and Alfonso Bedoya as Gold Hat (whose infamous Stinking Badges line has became a famous part of this film) the same can be said, all round terrific performances.\r\n\r\nJohn Huston's direction and screenplay adaptation of the novel by B. Traven believe it or not won both the academy awards for Direction and Best adapted screenplay. For the first time in the history of the academy awards both a Father and Son won awards on the same night. If fact Huston said that the best moments of his life was working with his father and the night he won the Oscar for his performance in this film. Huston in both the director's chair and writers chair resulted in Oscar gold and hell the direction and scripting was Oscar worthy. Huston's direction is notable for its simple instructions that he gave to his actors that made them understand their characters if they were struggling. In fact the DVD documentary brought up how Bruce Bennett was struggling to grasp the key scene were Cody meets Dobbs, Curtin and Howard, Huston apparently gave Bennett a simple sentence that helped him grasp his character.\r\n\r\nOverall Thoughts: After viewing films like this, THE MALTESE FALCON [1941], Huston's next film KEY LARGO [1948] and THE AFRICAN QUEEN [1951] Huston as a writer director, there is a good reason why he has become one of my new Favourite movie directors for the simple reason he managed to bring out brilliant performances from his actors. As a whole THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE is without a doubt one of the best films I have seen just recently which is why I'm giving it 100% percent.",

            "content": "\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" makes a good John Huston direction. Three broke men (Huston, Bogart, Holt) are dying to get some money. When offered to get a job to collect gold from the mountains, and when they eagerly accept, they dont know what they're getting into-- jealousy, greed, hallucinations, et cetera. Eventually, this job will get the better of them. This is a masterpiece from Huston-- I've never been disappointed with his movies, and this one was definitely far from it. Humphrey Bogart is absolutely superb in his role, and outdoes the entire cast by a landslide. It's fun to see him play the rough and tough characters like in \"The African Queen\", considering he was always casted in the film-noir tough guy roles. His greedy, drunken behavior seems entirely real, and his doomed fate is just because of it, and yet Huston's father was the one that won the Oscar. Oh, and did I mention Bogie wasn't nominated? Jesus, what's wrong with the Academy?? I felt Huston captured the essence of the setting, and though much was filmed on location, the scenes that are made on the studio set, its almost like he did as much as he could to make it look real. It's nice to see such good film-making, because today there's so few memorable films. This is awesome. Recommended",

In the beginning Howard explains that gold changes a man. At first he will say \"let's go for $10,000 and stop\" but when he gets it he will want $25,000, then $50,000, then $100,000. Dobbs says that would never happen to him. He just wants enough money to live. He trusts his buddy Curtin with everything. When they decide to go in on the trip he says he will pay for it all, no problems now that he has the winning ticket for $200. The gem of the film is Bogie's transformation as the trip goes further. We find out he's not quite as tough as he makes himself out to be. Same goes for Curtin. But when they find the treasure they are ready to work their butts off for the money, but Dobbs starts to question Curtin and Howard's integrity. The beginning of the film is filled with comedy, and as it goes further there is more of a tense feeling in the air. You really see how crazy Dobbs has gone when Cody follows Curtin back from town and he decides right away that the best way to get rid of him is to kill him. John Huston created a masterpiece. Again, not able to show everything he wants to with the violence, but still getting his point across, Huston creates an exciting western. Howard is hilarious with his laugh. He is the most human of them all, while Curtin is the saint-like character, and Dobbs delves into the evil side. Loved every second of it.",

There, the biggest threat to their endeavor turns out to be, not thieves or rattlesnakes, but the effect of gold on man's moral sense.\r\n\r\nThis movie has the grit and environmental scenery (beautifully photographed) of a true western, including cantina brawls, gunfights, Indians, horse-riding banditos, and the thematic appeal of hardscrabble men forging a way through an untamed land. But Huston's epic is determinedly unforgiving, Hobbesian, and wry, with deeply amoralistic inclinations that belie the romanticism of the classic genre.\r\n\r\nBogart's Fred C. Dobbs may be an unforgettably despicable and weak fellow, whom greed drives to madness and destruction, but his kinder, gentler companions (Holt, and a perfect Walter Huston in a bull's-eye performance) are obviously closer to his reptilian shortcomings than we are comfortable to admit, once things get down and dirty in the middle of nowhere. At the end of the adventure, the surviving men can but laugh at the cosmic joke of their misfortunes and lost treasure. But no irony is necessary as they relate their shameless plans for the future, founded in dishonesty and incredible hubris. As they depart each other, spun out on the senseless wind like their briefly-held gold, one can almost see John Huston winking sardonically.\r\n\r\nThe message may be terribly cynical, but rings fairly true, and anyway the ride into and through this dusty, old masterpiece is worth every moment.",

Bogart displays a portrait of a clearly unsettled and insecure man plagued by the voices in his head, while Walter Huston (the director's dad) is just magic as a knee-slapping, yee-hawing jack-in-the-box who convincingly sees the up-side of everything.

After working a long job for an American who promises to pay Dobbs and his new friend Curtin (Tim Holt) an honest wage, the man reneges on his promise. Dobbs and Curtin find this man and assault him in an attempt to get what's coming to them, what they feel they have earned fair and square. Director John Huston uses these opening moments brilliantly to set up the men's sense of justice in order to show just how much it would be perverted later in the film. \nHuston's exceptional 1948 film, is not the adventure picture that the title suggests, but a harrowing and brutally realistic parable regarding human greed. \nEven before Dobbs becomes enchanted by gold, Huston gives the audience subtle hints about man's penchant for short term material gain. As Dobbs roams around the town looking for a meal, he asks the same man for a handout 3 times in one day. When the stranger (played by the director) confronts him about this, Dobbs genuinely seems surprised and apologizes by saying that he just only looked at the man's hands and the money he gave him. While his blind greed isn't in the forefront of his conscious yet, it is certainly shaping his actions. \nWhen Dobbs & Curtin's fates collides with veteran prospector Howard (Walter Huston), they venture into the mountains to find their fortune.\nIn one particularly amazing scene which Huston uses to illuminate the powerful hold that this gold is starting have on these men, all three men awake in the middle of the night at different times and end up all following each other for fear of being robbed. Avarice turns completely rational actions into subversive. This is also seen when a seemingly well intentioned man approaches the prospectors with nothing in mind but a warm fire and good company. Before he can get a word out he is vilified and perceived as only a threat.\nHuston's camera isn't flashy because he has faith in the power of this story. He manages to get such good performances out of these actors that it made me forget about my previous distaste for Bogart. Huston's characters remain characters when in a story such as this, they could have easily become caricatures. There is still a sense of humanity in Dobbs all through his descent into madness. He isn't over the top and you find yourself at times sympathizing with this man who is obviously becoming unhinged before your eyes.  \nHuston also pulls off some well executed shots. After Dobbs has made enemies with a fellow prospector and a horrific act takes place, he attempts to fall asleep in front of the campfire. The shot is framed so it appears as though the flames were leaping up and engulfing Dobbs and the audience gets a brief glimpse into the personal hell that he is going through. \nWhile I could sit here and discuss every scene of this film, I don't want to give too much away. Huston has crafted an exquisite film and one of the best studies of human greed & the malleability of man's moral compass that I have ever seen.",

            "content": "One of the high watermarks in cinema, a place in the IMDB Top 100 and winner of three Oscars, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is not the subtlest of movies but it does move at a tremendous pace and is full of great acting and shooting.  The film came only two years after John Huston's film Let There Be Light, a rarely seen documentary about the after-effects of war on soldiers and TOSM is a much lighter but no less interesting film.  The story begins with Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and Curtin (Tim Holt) who are down on their luck men who are looking for money.  they meet an old man, Howard (Walter Huston) who plants the seed of gold in their head and it is not long after this that the three prospectors go off is search of the big find that will secure their financial future forever.  After this, the film settles down into a heist movie structure with the plans for 'capture' of the gold followed by paranoia and distrust of the other partners as they discuss how the gold should be split.  Howard has seen what the prospect of money does to men and admits he has gained and lost a fortune of gold over his lifetime.  In this sense, the film is a parable of Hollywood and the making of movies itself whereby effort and toil is invested only for the end product to rely on other means to be successful or a failure.  The power of Walter Huston's portrayal of this seemingly wise old man arrives at his intersection of prophet and prospector, a man who will jump about wildly at the sight of gold but who will tell of the dangers the gold may bring.  His reaction at the end of the film to one of these two outcomes is remarkable but entirely predictable.  The film works best when the three leads are together and watching their separate fortunes unroll.  Bogart is in excitingly mad form and Holt's calm Curtin is a perfect balance to the other characters.  Huston's direction is economical but some of the other characters in the film do not add to the film as much as the central characters.  Some say this is Huston's best (he won his only two Oscar's on this film and directed his father to the Best Supporting Actor role two years before his death) but I prefer his smaller films Fat City and Wise Blood.  a master director however and one which nearly every one of his films is worth watching.",
