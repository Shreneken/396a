Hiding the body in a chest upon which they then arrange a buffet dinner, the pair welcome their guests, including the victim's oblivious fiancée (Joan Chandler) and the college professor (James Stewart) whose lectures inadvertently inspired the killing.",

The whole thing taking place in one location through one continuous shot is an incredible feat. For the camerawork alone its a classic but the acting and great pacing put this in a everyone must see once category.",

Kudos to him for presenting a closeted gay couple in 1948, but their murder plot is even more hamhanded than Leopold and Loeb, on whom the film is based. Impossible to suspend disbelief here. Also his \"invisible wipes\" are an interesting experiment but unnecessary, as experts have pointed out.",

Plenty of literal \"loose ends\" here, too; they strangle the \"guest of honor\" with multiple knots around the neck, yet the titled murder weapon dangles from the makeshift casket / slash / buffet table and is easily withdrawn.  Stewart's suspicion is far too easily aroused, too.  OK, David isn't in attendance, at least not visibly, but would that cause a normal person to subject the hosts to the Third Degree?  As for Hitchcock's attempts to outdo Orson Wells in the long take department, it simply draws attention to itself without adding anything to the story.",

            "content": "Outside of the expected films like Psycho and Rear Window, Hitchcock has been a blindspot to me, despite my obsession with the krimini and giallo films that owe a debt to his work. Let's change that!\n\nBased on the 1929 play of the same name by Patrick Hamilton, this movie was adapted by Hume Cronyn — yes, the actor and husband of Jessica Tandy — with a screenplay by Arthur Laurents.\n\nAfter Lifeboat, this is the second in a series of Hitchcock's films that take place in limited settings. Plus, it takes place in real time and appears to be a series of single takes that are covered by some really clever editing by William Ziegler (who also worked on Strangers on a Train and Spellbound for Hitchcock).\n\nBrandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger) want to prove their intelligence by staging the perfect murder. And to do so, they don't just theoretically discuss it. No, instead, they strangle their old classmate David Kentley (Dick Hogan), hide his body in their apartment and then invite their friends over for a dinner party.\n\nThis whole scheme came from discussions they had back in college with their housemaster Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) about Nietzsche's Übermensch and De Quincey's theory that murder is a way of showing one's superiority over others. Yes, the same opium-loving De Quincey whose writing inspired Suspiria, Inferno and Mother of Tears. So he's a guest to take part in their artwork, as it were, as are several former classmates, friends and even the dead man's father.\n\nThe claustrophobia of this movie comes from not only the killers being unable to deal with the impact of their crime — it's one thing to calmly discuss a murder in the classroom and its another to actually get your hands dirty — as well as the fact that there's a dead body in a trunk the entire time that people are making merry.\n\nIf you're looking for a movie that pushes the limits of what could be done at the time, Rope is it. That's totally not claustrophobic, as Hitchcock was pushing for something that hadn't been done on film before. The long unbroken shots — which frustrated Stewart, who claimed that the experiment was worth taking but didn't work — were unlike anything in standard moviemaking at the time. And it led to really technical things needing to happen, as the entire set was on rollers and could silently be moved as parts come in and out of the scene. What you aren't seeing is a huge crew that were constantly moving heavy furniture and the huge Technicolor camera so as they wouldn't be seen on camera, as well as multiple sound and camera people so that everything could remain in constant motion.\n\nKeep that in mind as you watch the acting in this movie, as there was also a series of cues that the talent had to follow as well as actually act in the movie. Of course, this also led to plenty of issues on set, as there was an incident when the camera dolly ran over and broke a cameraman's foot. In order to keep filming, he was gagged and dragged off the set. That take is in the movie.\n\nBeyond that, this is shot on a stage with a gigantic cyclorama as the background — the largest one ever made — which had models of the New York skyline, as well as working chimneys and lights, a sunset that was artificially created as the movie's runtime moves along and even spun glass clouds that could change position and shape.\n\nHitchcock even shot a prequel to the film in the trailer, showing the world outside the apartment, showing that he implicitly understood how to sell one of his movies by telling the audience that this would be the last time that they'd see David Kentley alive.\n\nThis movie was pretty controversial at the time, as the implied relationship between the leads led it to be banned in some cities. Keep in mind that this movie is less than a century old when you complain out how people are so sensitive. This is where we've come from and it wasn't all that long ago.\n\nThis movie was unavailable for three decades because its rights were bought back by Hitchcock and left as part of his legacy to his daughter Patricia. The other four lost films were Rear Window, The Man Who Knew Too Much, The Trouble with Harry and Vertigo. They were finally re-released in theaters in 1984 after thirty-five years of not being seen. Again, we live in a different world where everything is available; it was not always this way.",

Hitchcock's often overlooked masterpiece sees two college intellectuals decide to murder a fellow student just to prove they can commit the perfect crime.

Hitchcock backs up his claim that conversations in a thriller should take place as if there was a bomb under the table at all times, and Rope is a brilliant example of this. It's influence can still be seen now, in films like Buried (2010) or Phone Booth (2003, RIP Joel Schumacher), and that's just off the top of my head. And obviously, James Stewart is brilliant.",

In Rope he is drunk on his artistic freedom. The attempt at \"one-shot\" filming and progression in real time adds to the claustrophobic suspense of the story. Although it is also a bit distracting in itself, it's amazing to imagine the level of skill required to perform the 10 minute cutless scenes Hitchcock demanded - as that was the length of film housed in the gigantic technicolour cameras that you can imagine moving throughout the set as actors and set pieces moved around them in a technical modern dance. It's a testament to Hitchcock's (and the actor's) talent that even though you never see violence or blood and you know nearly exactly what happened and who done it that there can be any suspense at all. I love that viewers are simply thrown in seemingly mid-action and expected to keep up. The performances are wonderful and you can see why this was the start of a productive and phenomenal relationship between Hitchcock and James Stewart. Rope actually eludes to that same stifling tension that makes Rear Window my favourite of his films.",

The acting feels less compelling all around, and Jimmy Stewart seems miscast for the role, particularly in the earlier scenes.

Hitchcock shot this film in several long cuts and made it appear as though the entire film was shot in one take. Not to mention this was also Hitchcocks first film in color as well. The movie opens with two young men Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger) murdering an old classmate of theirs named David Kentley (Dick Hogan). The two strangle David with some rope and hide his body in a chest. The two of them think they are superior and doing this as sort of research and therefore have done the perfect murder. They end up covering the chest up and along with their maid Mrs Wilson (Edith Evanson) begin preparing for a dinner party where they've invited David's parents, David's fiancee Janet (Joan Chandler), Kenneth (Douglas Dick) Janet's ex boyfriend and David's aunt Mrs. Atwater (Constance Collier). Lastly, Brandon and Phillip's old prep school housemaster Rupert Cadell (James Stewart).The idea of being superior branch from a conversation the two young men had with Rubert during school and sort of triggered the idea in them. Brandon even believes that Rupert would approve of what they've done. Throughout the night two two men try and go along with the dinner party, but it all starts to get to Phillip and soon enough Rupert begins suspecting something's going on. So, this is definitely the best of the Hitchcock film's i've seen so far during this little marathon I'm doing (so far). It's incredibly well acted, I enjoyed the concept of the single shot, and truthfully it's kinda a creepy premise. Two guys kill someone, stash the body, serve cheese and crackers where his body is and they invite the dead guys family all as a sort of big F**K you? Creepy indeed. This is the first James Stewart film that he collaborated with Hitchcock on and while he famously didn't enjoy this film since he believed he was miscast I think he's perfect here. The movie flows and is the perfect length (only an hour twenty) and I would recommend giving this one a look!",

And the energy wears off due to its inessential and frankly dull detour that it takes in order to fill the content up till the real times goes off that ticks on the back off the screen. And even though the ticking bomb goes off quite early to keep the audience tangled in its if-i-must \"rope\". But it still isn't out of its self-created damp surface. The concept itself is a double edge sword. Since both the crime and the investigation of it taken place on screen with live time screenplay the audience finds itself waiting for the writers to achieve their closure that starts to feel like a homework after a while.\n\nThe adapted screenplay is from a play which explains the continuity and the flow of the film that is played smartly by the camera work and cinematography in here. The side characters are unfortunately undercooked and are explored only on surface only where the actors are handed over a post it note showing their characteristics which they have managed to hold on to throughout the course. The backstory of the professor and his students who throws the party does help a lot on connecting the dots.\n\nStewart as the analyser and resolver of the drama is the best support that the two lead actors can aspire for. Grander gets a more unimpressive role to portray hence fails to overpower Dall on his scenes. Whilst Dall is the creator of all, the real convincer, the schemer that tries to bind it all no matter how much it scatters.

Good acting and good plot and dialogue is all you need to make a perfect movie. And a good director. Hitchcock has grasped my interest now, his camera work and skill really show in this one, it feels as if it's all in one take. \"Rope\" is meant to have some homosexual undertones, and I can say it quite does so.

Eleven years later, Richard Fleischer's Compulsion would rip the same two Nietzsche-driven cold blooded joy killers as an excuse for Orson Welles to one up James Stewart's moral monologue. The result was much less satisfying, with Welles playing a far more predictable, dimensionless character. Stewart is less about moral preaching for the audience, more about a man having a moral breakdown before our eyes. He delights in the same macabre humor as his killing friends, a voracious appetite for constant suspicion, deducing what's at the heart of any given matter, the underlying motive behind all things. His cynicism is exactly what Brandon is looking for after murdering his friend David, forcing the brute Phillip into the mix, who hates all this. Brandon is in this for the thrill, for getting close to being caught, but just getting by. His idea of a sick joke is to have a party gathering David's friends, leaving everyone wondering where David is... right in the room, buried, dead. Hitchcock never cuts from this room, the camera tracing every bit of action, all in real time. Hitchcock made a career of suspense, but he didn't resort to the same formulas, always on the lookout for a new way to keep an audience gripped. Should they or shouldn't they know? What are the ramifications of either scenario? In Rope, we know everything, it's all deduction ala Colombo. The question is: will they get away with it? The other question is that if James Stewart has an appreciation for the kind of thrill these boys are into, will he share in helping them cover the crime? Or will he have his own arc? Hitchcock literally has us hanging at the end of a rope to find out.",

            "content": "Suspenseful to the end!\n\nAlfred Hitchcock develops his uniquely tense directorial style with his 1948 film Rope. It is an enclosed movie all shot in one apartment set. This setting leaves the viewer feeling claustrophobic and uneasy. Rope opens up on a murder, then the rest of the film is figuring out how these murderers will get away with it or not. I find Rope to be an interesting twist on the crime genre.\n\nIn regards to Rope's suspense, much of the atmosphere is built up with the lack of cuts. Everything is designed to look like we are watching these events in real time. We watch an entire dinner party take place during Rope. The suspicions and the clueless alike are present. Rope drags a bit towards the end, but the beginning and middle are tremendously nerve racking.\n\nRope features an intriguing cast. James Stewart is excellent as the ever observant professor. The main characters are Brandon and Phillip. John Dall plays the suave and charming sociopath Brandon. His cocky coolness is unnerving unto itself. He is quite eerie. Then, the uncertain and frantic Phillip is portrayed by the stressed out Farley Granger. The rest of the cast is mostly forgettable as they do not get many lines of dialogue. The main three men are enjoyable at least.\n\nThe main flaw to Rope is not it's short running time, but its slow pace. It is so meandering to the end, it may turn off some viewers. I found Rope to be engaging until the finale as it feels more like a slow burn. The suspense is palpable, but it may leave a few audience members bored at times. The lack of cuts to simulate a continuous take may also make Rope feel longer than its meager run time.\n\nOverall, Rope is a fascinating take on the suspense drama genre. The mystery is unique in that we already know who killed the victim, but we get to witness the audacious cover-up instead. Rope is nice to a single watch, but I'm not sure I will return to it frequently. Hitchcock was clearly experimenting and trying new things with Rope.",

Utilizing the camera and having such fluidity from scene to scene, all while maintaining the tension and suspense was so interesting to me to watch. It truly felt like no beat was missed throughout the whole film. One scene in particular that stood out was in the beginning of the film, just after Brandon and Phillip kill David, the rope that was used to kill him is still hanging out of the chest, looming. Brandon and Phillip are both moving into and out of the foreground of the shot, cleaning up for the party later that night. The rope is constantly in frame and in focus, the shadow over the rest of the film and night. That moment is such a great setup for later when Brandon gives David's dad the books, and chooses to tie them together with the same rope that he killed his son with. The pacing especially was fantastic. The film never moved too fast or too slow, always just right. One particular example that I enjoyed was when Mrs. Wilson was taking care of everything in the dining room, and cleaning up dinner from the chest. The shot stays on her, never moving, as she takes care of each item in the dining room and the sitting room. The tension slowly but surely builds, and she almost opens the lid of the chest, but is stopped just in time by Brandon.",

James Stewarts character throughout the run-time concludes that something unusual was occurring. Watching him investigate was tense.\nWhen I was watching it, The characters took me in from the beginning. Their development made some fairly believable chemistry. It was all brought together perfectly with the swift and smart dialogue.\n\nCinematography: 8.5/10\nEditing: 10/10\nActing: 10/10\nSet design: 9/10\nEntertainment value: 9.99/10\n\nOver all, Rope was yet another masterpiece made by the one and only Alfred Hitchcock. It was a unique piece of art and without a doubt, a memorable one. 5/5 stars",

            "content": "One of the dilemmas which confronts any film reviewer is how much attention to pay to a director's opinions about their own films. A director's opinion of their work can change drastically over time and very seldom lines up with critical or popular opinion. \nRobert Altman went so far in an interview with The Onion to say that \"you tend to love your least successful children the most\", arguing that he felt more affection for his much-maligned Popeye than films like MASH, Nashville and Short Cuts which had been universally embraced.\n\nWe find ourselves in this position when approaching Rope, Alfred Hitchcock's first film since his escape from the clutches of uber-producer David O. Selznick. Coming just before his rich run of form in the 1950s, it finds him in a wildly experimental mood, with long takes, small sets and the action playing out in real time. Hitchcock was less than satisfied with the finished film (calling it \"an experiment that didn't work out\"), it made little money in its day and remains somewhat overlooked in retrospectives. All of which is a shame - because it's a tense and terrifying masterpiece, and one of his very best films.\n\nEven if you don't quite go along with this assessment, there can be no denying Rope's interest from a technical perspective. This was the first time that Hitchcock had used long, uninterrupted takes; he eschews much of the conventional editing language of Hollywood, filming in ten-minute takes and finding clever ways to hide the joins (panning behind people's backs or past items of furniture, for instance). The walls of the set were on rollers and stagehands had to constantly move the furniture around as the actors performed to make room for the large Technicolor camera. Such was Hitchcock's commitment to the technique that he had a camera operator gagged to stop his screams being caught on film after his foot was broken during a dolly shot.\n\nGiven that Hitchcock had earned his reputation through his impressive coverage and editing decisions, you would naturally expect that discarding these techniques would lead to the scales falling from the eyes of the audience. While the setting and character names are changed, the film is structurally very faithful to Patrick Hamilton's 1929 stage play. Both are essentially chamber pieces with little or no scope for taking the audience outside to broaden things out (as in the film version of The Odd Couple). Hitchcock famously disliked filmed versions of theatre productions, branding them \"photographs of people talking\", which makes his  creative decisions here seem all the more curious.\n\nThe great miracle of Rope is that it is incredibly cinematic. It's an immensely claustrophobic work, every bit as pressurised and intimidating as Roman Polanski's apartment trilogy. Hitchcock's carefully chosen camera movements remove any stagey quality from the piece, turning the audience from a passive, disinterested spectator into a helpless, mesmerised observer. Just as in Rear Window, our part in the drama is established from the outset - we are given no means of escape, and yet as much as we wish to leave we cannot look away.\n\nIn an interview with the AFI in the 1960s, Hitchcock talked about his method of creating tension, citing the example of having a bomb under a table and detailing how to put an audience through the mill and provide relief. In Rope the 'bomb' is present from the beginning, and the small amount of dramatic irony it provides slowly builds until both characters and audience are at breaking point. Hitchcock keeps reminding us of the chest wherein the body lies, and we become wound like a tight spring in fear that it will be discovered. In the sequence where Mrs Wilson keeps moving back and forth from it, our heart is our mouth that she will find out what is inside.\n\nAside from being masterfully executed (no pun intended), Rope is also a deeply subversive work in this regard. We know that Brandon and Phillip are guilty as hell right from the start, but as the film winds on we find ourselves perversely growing to like them; we almost admire them for both the audacity of their scheme and their sheer nerve of covering it up in such a way. The film presents us with fantastically dark dialogue and amoral, black-hearted characters who wouldn't seem out of place in Heathers, mixing psychological thriller with black comedy to astonishing effect.\n\nThe dialogue in Rope is absolutely brazen about its subject matter. It gives us characters from respectable, well-mannered backgrounds and have them wax lyrical about murder and Aryan principles without any hint of self-consciousness. It's like The Tell-Tale Heart re-imagined as a dinner party, pointing forward in equal measure to Anthony Shaffer's Sleuth and Moira Buffini's Dinner. Brandon relishes the attention and sees the situation as a welcome challenge; he talks about planning a death in order to deflect suspicion and lampshade the crime he has committed. Amongst his indulgence, Phillip's torment and remorse gradually break through, as the mask slips on both his own guilt and the hypocrisy of the society he inhabits. \n\nRope is also extremely effective in its deconstruction of academia - specifically how ideas which appear to have merit on paper become monstrous when acted upon. Jimmy Stewart's character is like the evil flip-side of his character in Mr Smith Goes to Washington: both are principled, educated men who want the best for society, but their notices of justice and their bases for law and order are very different. Stewart uses philosophy to justify murder as an abstract concept and argues the benefits which such an approach could bring to society. At the end of the film he is confronted with the endpoint of his intellectual labours; a broken man, he leans back on the traditional morality he claimed to have surpassed and calls the police.\n\nRope is also interesting for its approach to true crime. The play was inspired by the infamous Leopold and Leob case which rocked America in the 1920s and centred around the notion of two young men attempting to commit the perfect crime. The case has inspired a range of subsequent films, which have all taken different approaches; where Compulsion focussed on the court case and the public outcry, this is closer in tone to Tom Kalin's Swoon, insofar as it is interested in the mental state and relationship between the two young murderers.\n\nThe sexual politics of Rope are a real bone of contention. The film is a product of more conservative times, when homosexuality was still a major social taboo (and a crime), and Hitchcock was always more interested in how to present a given story than he was in the story itself. The film never argues that Brandon and Phillip were driven to kill David because of their (implied) homosexuality, or that their sexual preferences clouded their moral judgement. On the other hand, given how daring the rest of the film is, one might argue that it should have been as upfront with this aspect as it is with everything else: is denying that something could exist just as offensive as presenting it as a negative stereotype?\n\nThe film's main defence in this regard would be that it isn't all that interested in sexuality, of any description. Like The Vanishing four decades after it, it's a broader study about the amount of evil people are capable of committing, as well as how said evil is rationalised to excuse or justify it, and what the consequences are for the innocent parties. You can read into some of the imagery if you please - seeing the chest as 'the closet' into which Stewart's straight character peers - but the drama is not dependent on you forming an opinion on this matter one way or another.\n\nRope is a terrific film which deserves to be ranked alongside Rear Window and Vertigo as one of Hitchcock's finest works. He wrings every last drop of tension out of a very self-contained, self-limiting premise, ably assisted by a trio of great performances from John Dall, Farley Grainger and Jimmy Stewart. Whatever one's feelings on its sexual politics (or lack thereof), there can be little denying its effectiveness as a thriller, which even 70 years on can leave an audience with shredded nerves and shattered hearts.",

            "content": "The way Rope is presented feels a lot like a stage play. Hitchcock tried to give the illusion of one continuous shot for the entire film, so it all takes place in one room and only involves a handful of people talking with one another for an hour and a half. I was concerned for some of that time that it was going to get boring, but most of the slow part is in the early scenes as people are arriving and being introduced.\n\nOnce the film gets rolling there is a palpable rising tension that permeates every conversation. Philip becomes more tense, Brandon becomes more careless, and Rupert becomes more suspicious. This elevates the dialogue in such a way that almost every word spoken has a double meaning. I love any scene in a film where people are saying one thing but you can sense they are actually talking about something else, and this movie is loaded with that stuff.\n\nOf course the king of delivering these lines with depth and meaning is the great Jimmy Stewart. There are no words for how superb he is in Rope. I could not get enough of watching his mind work, and the way his tone would change based on his inner thoughts. John Dall and Farley Granger did a great job with their parts as the killers, but when Stewart goes to work I was simply in awe. I'll admit the rest of the cast I found largely forgettable, but in most of the scenes their characters are just pawns being manipulated by these 3 key players.\n\nThen there is the genius of Hitchcock himself. While there were some odd choices made with the camera (I suspect most of those were ways of concealing cuts between takes) most of the time he knows perfectly what to show you and what to hide. There's one scene, and I think anyone who has seen this film will know which scene I'm referencing, where an entire conversation is going on off-camera. I barely heard a word of the conversation because Hitchcock keeps the camera fixated so that we feel every tension-filled second as it seems the murder is about to be discovered.\n\nRope is a film that made me feel thrills the way that few films can manage. My body was all tight and anxious, not because of explosive action or cheap jump scares, but simply because of a well-crafted story and good camerawork. I'll admit it did take me a little time to become fully invested in the story, but once I bought in I could not look away. I'm anxious to watch Rope again and see if it can affect me as well as it did this first time. If it is that effective on a re-watch, then my rating for it might go even higher. A truly superb masterpiece!",

The plot revolves around two young men who strangle their 'inferior' classmate, hide his body in their apartment, and invite his friends and family over for a dinner party as a means to prove the perfection of their crime. Rope is essentially Hitchcock's attempt to bring stage and screen together, with the film consisting of one location and multiple long takes cleverly edited together to appear as one shot. While that basically makes the film one big technical experiment, Hitchcock pulls it off masterfully - with some truly brilliant camerawork, gripping performances, and suspense that starts building from the opening shot and doesn't let up for 80 minutes. Having the whole thing unfold in real time allows the audience to witness every second of manipulation the two murderers inflict upon their guests, and the cat and mouse game that follows. John Dall and Farley Granger are terrific as the two killers, with Dall as the manipulative and unpredictable sociopath, and Granger the nervous wreck who could crack at any moment. James Stewart (in his first Hitchcock role) plays the two men's college professor who suspects something is wrong and may have unwillingly set their murderous plot into action. Almost 70 years later and Rope remains a timeless classic that still grabs your complete attention from the opening frame, and will rightly be remembered as one of Hitchcock's best, and most daring, films.",

            "content": "Phenomenal camera work and another classic character portrayal by Jimmy Stewart are the two main factors that make this film passable.  True to form Hitchcock slips in the \"reverse Bond scene\" where the good guy explains to the bad guy how the main crime did/could have gone down (as opposed to the James Bond bad guy explaining his entire plot for world domination before actually attempting to kill 007).  A similar scene was done in Dial M for Murder.  \n\nYet I found myself unable to get past the one major (and, to me) glaring plot-hole in this film: there is no plausible reason for Rupert (Stewart) to automatically assume that his college buddies had nefariously done something to the lone missing party guest.  AH attempts to explain this away by repeating (often) how Rupert has a mind that works similar to Brandon's and especially Phillip's.  But the explanation just doesn't hold water for me.  Were I to attend a dinner party, and someone that is perpetually on time was a no-show, it would take ALOT MORE for me to conclude that my friends had kidnapped/murdered said guest than the fact that I knew the hosts to be curious and mischevious.  \n\nRegardless, a fun, quick film with exquisite camera work and a heavy sense of paranoia and trepidation certainly keeps the viewer's attention for the duration.  I wouldn't dispute someone that held this movie in higher esteem based on the script, but for me, as I said, that plot-hole completely engulfed my digestion of this film.  (And as a final aside, I wonder if the 80 minutes would have been more satisfying as is, were we never to see the murder take place in the opening frame.  In other words, have this movie, but leave it up to the viewer to debate whether or not a crime actually was committed at all by Phillip and Brandon, or whether Rupert was just overly paranoid and out of line.  Until the penultimate scene of course.  And fear not, this is no spoiler, for the murder is quite literally the first thing you see in this film after the opening credits.....Dear me, apologies for this rant, apparently I had a decent amount to say about Rope!)",

They want to celebrate their perfectly executed plan by having a dinner party with David's father (Cedric Hardwicke), his Aunt (Constance Collier), his girlfriend, Janet (Joan Chandler), Janet's ex, Kenneth (Douglas Dick), and their former tutor, Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) as their guests. Brandon is convinced that no one will suspect that they murdered David for the sake of experimenting, and it would be great to have his body hidden there while his relatives and close friends dine next to it. Phillip on the other hand is a nervous wreck and thinks that inviting Rupert is a terrible idea and that they are going a bit too far with everything.     \n\nOf course the first thing that comes up when talking about Rope is the way that Hitchcock decided to film it as if it were one continuos take. The film is actually shot in 10 long takes, and the audience can easily spot those moments (it isn't subtle as in Birdman) but for a film made in 1948 it was a feat to pull off. This is by far Hitchcock's most theatrical film and shooting the scenes as if they were taking place in real time was a way for him to approach the material in a different way. He had to build the suspense without relying on the score or parallel action scenes. Rope has a very exciting climax, but it is very predictable for audiences today. It is also a very wordy film, but Hitchcock never misses an opportunity to include his morbid sense of humor. I love James Stewart, but in this film his character has several flaws, one being the way he rationalizes murder at first during a conversation with the rest of the guests and later the character seems to take a 180 degree turn. I still have to give Hitchcock a lot of credit for trying something new with Rope and continuing to innovate in his films. \n\nBeside the experimental element of Rope there is a strong underlying homosexual vibe between the two murderers although it is never referenced directly by anyone. They are going to travel together to the country and they use that as an excuse to invite their friends for a farewell party. The performances are all strong in this film and it is by far the most stagey film in Hitchcock's career. He may have just been playing with the concept, but there is no doubt that he also inspired future filmmakers to do the same. Rope is another rich legacy from Hitchcock. The performances in the film are solid and Farley Granger plays a very different character from the one he went on to play in Strangers on a Train. James Stewart was obviously the star at the moment, but he doesn't appear until almost thirty minutes into the film. His screen presence does elevate the film once he arrives at the home. John Dall plays the main villain very well, but it was his only collaboration with Hitchcock. I'd probably rank Rope around the middle of Hitchcock's filmography, but it sure was ahead of its time.\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

At less than 90 minutes long this still struggles to fill what little it has to say, much of which is centred around two friends who commit \"the perfect murder\". The glaring problem here is that the perfect murder is one that involves both the killing and disposal of the victim without any incriminating evidence upon the killers at all, so the very idea of strangling someone (not a spoiler as it happens within the first five minutes) then putting the corpse inside chest could only be considered perfect by a couple of idiots. There is some interest involving the ethics of the state power over the lives of the masses, but overall I found it hard to care about anyone or indeed anything.

            "content": "\"Rope,\" directed by Alfred Hitchcock might not be one of his well-known films, but I recommended it to any fan of the film master of horror. The film starts off with a murder, \"what else,\" but what makes this film worth watching is not the suspense of \"who killed who,\" but rather how one tries to prove the justification of murder. Now don't get me wrong there is no justification for any type of murder, but what keeps this film shinning is the personal growth of a college professor played brilliantly by James Stewart who once preached that the \"act of killing\" can be justified if you kill the right person for the right reason. Tragically two of his students played perfectly by Farley Granger and John Dall take this to heart and kill a fellow friend they think is not that worthy of living. They then invite his friends, family and the professor for a feast that literally is placed over the dead body as the dinner party worries and wonders where and why their loved never showed up to the party. As good as the acting is, the story written by Arthur Laurents, Hume Cronyn, and Ben Hecht are just as compelling with drama. I know it doesn't sound much like a plot, and true there is not much action (it was released in 1948) but believe it or not I guarantee you that once you start this film you will be hooked right away. On a side note, Hitchcock uses a camera technique I haven't seen done before or since by filming the whole picture in one take, or shot. He did however have to change rolls every fifteen minutes because they didn't have digital cameras back in 1948. So if you are ever in the mood for a thought proving suspense thriller a little different then all the fast pace computer generated films of today (not that all of them are bad) check out Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rope.\" If you have seen it before watch it again. I have seen it many times. You won't be disappointed by the \"master of suspense.\"",

Last year's Gravity had a great tracking shot that lasted more than 10 minutes at the beginning and some other long shots here and there; well, Rope is mostly and essentially one long tracking shot. The camera cuts to another angle at times, but quickly gets back into the long shots, thus creating a really in-depth experience, making us feel we are really there. Also, the cuts are only when really necessary, another great technique from Hitchcock, who knew about timing. Running only some mere 80 minutes, this film is an easy-going, assuring its re-watching value and giving you more opportunities to admire it.\r\n\r\nTechnically low on sight, the film is nevertheless huge outside of the camera. Moving the set during the shots surely wasn't easy, and at the end you can't help but admire it. The background   subtly changes from broad daylight to night and even the clouds move! Too sad it wasn't a big hit back then, cause it surely deserved to be it. Rope delivers exactly how Hitchcock intended it, therefore remarking himself once more as one of cinema's great directors.",

            "content": "Alfred Hitchcock has always crafted superb films, his sense of style, the way he mounts the tension, terror and thrills is unmatched by any director that has ever stepped behind the camera. With Rope he crafts a stunning, flawless thriller that is a genre classic and is elevated by stunning performances by its lead actors. Hitchcock's direction is brilliant, and he yet again cements his reputation as one of the finest directors that has ever lived. Rope is a classic picture, one that definitely needs to be seen by genre fans, and it's a film that steadily builds up the tension, in order for the viewer to really get into the story and not turn away. Thrillers like this are hard to tope, and Rope is a flawless picture that ranks as vintage Hitchcock. With James Stewart as a lead, Hitchcock always managed to get the most with each of his performance, and having seen a few of Stewart's performances, Rope stands out, and he delivers a perfect performance, and he was one of the finest actor of the era. Rope is a short film, but it makes the most of it due to its story, which is constantly enthralling and is edge of your seat material. The pacing is effective as well and even if it's a short picture, it gets to the point, and it's very entertaining. Hitchcock was a master, and Rope is one of his finest thrillers. If you're a fan of this genre, then this is a definite must watch. With emphasis on tension, and effective storytelling, Rope is one of the finest thrillers that has ever been committed to film.",

The reason I enjoyed this film is because it lays bare the fallacies of nihilistic thinking and philosophy, and that there are some philosophies that really bring no good to the world, regardless of their logical ends. Of course the film is well-liked because scene changes happened with the backs of actors and other things and it's also admirable that the whole movie takes place in one connected room, but I still think that the philosophical questions of the film are what make it worth seeing. I wasn't really a fan of how the movie mostly just monologues at the audience the whole time though, and it was off-putting in a way that didn't benefit the film in my opinion. Basic takeaways from the film though: you can't just eliminate everything in your way, men and women are not means to an end, and people have intrinsic worth even if they aren't as bright or clever as you are.",

After killing the friend, they place him in a chest and host a party, serving food on top of the closed chest and inviting the friends father, partner and even their former teacher. What we see is a masterclass in suspense and also an experimental one shot type film. Many shots are held for minutes on end, the set actually having walls on wheels to make it easier for camera's to move in and out. The film is apparently partly based on a real life assassination that used something taken from a Hitchcock film, the director feeling guilty for the murder just like the teacher feels guilty that his theories have lead to the murder in the film.",

There are only four cuts that are not hidden in the entire film.  The film is also Hitchcock's first film to be shot in color, and his first featuring James Stewart.  The story itself involves two young men who murder their friend, hide him in a large chest, and then invite his parents, his girlfriend, and his girlfriend's former boyfriend over just to prove they can get away with murder, because they believe themselves superior.  The smuggest of the two also invites their former teacher and mentor who planted the sick idea in his head with his casual ideas about murder.  The other boy becomes shaky almost immediately after the deed is done and slowly gets drunker and more rattled as the night goes on.  It is a really entertaining piece of filmmaking, with themes that are very Hitchcock with unique camerawork to keep you interested from beginning to end.  It was a really great film to experience.",

            "content": "Yeah, perhaps I've joked a touch too much about how lazy Alfred Hitchcock film titles got to be, but wow, this is kind of dull, at least because it doesn't have the guts to advertise that rope as a noose. I mean, simple strangulation with a rope suffices in this film, but don't have someone on the poster holding a straight piece of rope, just so you can tease us with the idea of figuring out a way to make rope exciting. Well, that poster can't be promising too much excitement if it's promoting James Stewart, because as awesome as he was, it's always been a little tough to take that voice seriously. All that being said, this film still promises some audacious storytelling moves, and boy does it deliver, on... being structured to seem like only a few extended shots for about 80 minutes. ...Well, not even Hitchcock's big cinematographic trick is all that thrilling in this film, or at least that one isn't, because this was also Hitchcock's first Technicolor project, and it sure did deliver on color. I mean, the film is so colorful that it has homosexual subtext, although that might just be Jimmy Stewart's natural flamboyance. Again, it's not especially easy to take the man seriously, but hey, this film is still more intriguing than the marketers might lead you to believe, at least up to a point.\n\nA real-time simulation that is very much set \"in the moment\" in a number of ways, this film doesn't exactly take the time to slow down and really flesh out the depths of its narrative, making it difficult to get invested into the characters through all of their questionable traits, no matter how much the film forces in attempts at compensation for development shortcomings with awkwardly incorporated expository dialogue. These crowbarred occasions in exposition reflect a lack of subtlety that is further reflected within the drama, because on top of featuring somewhat unlikable traits, this film's characters take some histrionic actions, some of which are major, as though they were trying to bloat the drama's bite beyond its conceptual boundaries. As you can imagine, this film's narrative is mighty minimalist, intentionally mixing in aimless with a conflict of a pair of murderers simply working to cover their tracks to thoroughly that, before too long, the conflict is lost in the midst of borderline nonsense, which is executed well enough to be fairly intriguing, but just so lacking in weight as a story concept. There are natural shortcomings to this film's questionably drawn narrative idea, as well as to this film's questionable storytelling style choice, for although I give a lot of respect to the uniqueness and genuine effectiveness of this film's stylistic move of simulating featuring only five cuts, the fly-on-the-wall storytelling of this film gets to be awkward before too long, especially when the film incorporates unmasked cuts that distance as something of a reflection of stylistic laziness. Inconsistencies in style all but aggravate in their betraying audacious ideas, yet there's still not enough editing dynamicity to prevent a sense of aimlessness to the real-time storytelling idea to kick in something fierce, and it doesn't help that Arthur Laurents and an uncredited Ben Hecht plague their screenplay with repetitious draggy spells that tend to feel too superfluous to be bought as anything more than excess. Interpreting a paper-thin story concept into a final product that runs a mere 80 minutes, this film may need its excess, but it still gets to be too overdrawn for its own good, even for what it is as a narratively thin and stylistically questionable affair that was never to go all that far in the long run. The final product is ultimately pretty firmly secured as underwhelming, but it would have fallen deeper if it wasn't so inspired in so many places, maybe not to where it compels all that much, but certainly to where it adequately engages, especially aesthetically.\n\nAs you can imagine, filming is a very, very important element in this particular film by Alfred Hitchcock, - a man who was always well-known for his special plays on visual style - and it is given quite the special treatment, with Joseph A. Valentine and William V. Skall delivering on Technicolor cinematography that bounces color lushly, with some subtle grain that fits the griminess of this drama, and immerses you about as much as the tracking shot filming style that, while often aimless, is well-framed enough and smooth enough to draw you into the environment. The fly-on-the-wall style of the film is questionable when it comes to substance, but in terms of style, it's remarkable as technical achievement that immerses you in Hitchcock's world pretty deeply, and truly immerses you in substance when Hitchcock backs inspiration in style with inspiration in storytelling. Possibly driven more by style than substance, as well as blandly thoughtful, Hitchcock's direction is questionable in plenty of places, but even outside of style, it excels, at least at times, placing enough realization to its thoughtful storytelling to keep the slow spells from devolving too far into blandness, and make the more subtle dramatic touches biting. Subtlety is limited by a histrionic script, which also limits plenty of other areas in substance that Hitchcock's directorial highlights could have milked for all their worth, yet there's enough inspiration to Hitchcock's efforts to engage enough to firmly secure the final product as decent, far away from the mediocrity that it could have slipped into. The film's story concept is simply too thin for comfort, and yet, decency wouldn't be secured so firmly if there wasn't still plenty of intrigue to this subject matter regarding intellectuals' interactions and harboring of dark secrets, often genuinely brought to life by a script that, despite its underdevelopment, histrionics and dragging, has enough snap to its dialogue to sustain a degree of entertainment value, and perhaps even richen what extensive characterization there is. Of course, what brings about as much life to characterization as it can is, of course, the acting, which is pretty strong across the board, especially with the leads, with James Stewart and John Dall being particularly charismatic, while Farely Granger steals the show, capturing the subtle dramatic layers and consistent degree of overwhelmed emotional intensity that define the anxiety of a man guilty over and in fear of being caught for a sickening deed. When Granger really shines, he powers some of the film's most effective moments, of which there are, of course, only so many in this aimless affair, although that isn't to say that there isn't enough technical and narrative inspiration to keep you going, at least about as much as the shortcomings will allow you to.\n\nOnce the knot has slipped, expository shortcomings, histrionics, questionable aspects to story and style concepts, and limp pacing leave the final product to tumble into underwhelmingness, but through an excellent visual style, relatively effective direction, some sharp writing moments, and strong performances, Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rope\" pulls through as a decent and often effective experimental thriller, at least for what it is.\n\n2.5/5 - Fair",

My personal favourite of his films is Psycho(1960) and I certainly feel that this film is better than North By Northwest(1959). The main thing I liked about this film is the strong dialogue. Once you go past the first half an hour, every single dialogue that comes at you wou;ld have a strong sense and they are not just mere dialogues. The only problem that I felt with this film is that in the beginning itself they show a murder committed by the hero's. They do it because they believe that murder is only meant for superior beings. That's acceptable, but the film maker never tells you why this particular victim was selected. That's a fault for sure. Other than this, Rope is a film with a good social commentary. The two main leads are my favourite in this film, Brandon is the strong one who does not fear about the coincidences of his actions(murder in fact) and I feel that I am more like Phillip. Phillip is always confused, and his lack of guts leads to the murder being caught open. I feel that i am more like Phillip because if I commit a murder and if I am put in such a situation, then I would definitely fail to save my neck.",

            "content": "An excellent Hitchcock adaptation of a screenplay.  The acting and the characters are all well told.  The film was specifically meant for an American audience, but it was not very successful.  Part of the issue, I suspect, is that the audience sees the murder occur at the beginning, so there is no sense of mystery.  Everyone knows, given the code standards, how such a film will conclude.  The suspense is still there for anyone who enjoys plays in terms of trying to figure out when it will all unravel.  \n\nTwo male friends decide to commit a murder.  The leader of the two is intent on following through based on his own fascination with Nietzsche and murder as a possible form of art.  The superior individuals should overpower the inferior.  Part of the plan is to host a party as a farewell since the two are headed to the countryside together.  As the guests arrive, the dynamics between the characters are exploited and the main characters must try to hold their own together without breaking down.  \n\nHitchcock decided to film the movie as if it was all one continuous shot with only one camera.  The camera moves through the set along with the action.  To achieve this effect, as the camera moves it ends with the shot of someone's back and starts up again as it moves away and around.  It was Hitchcock's first film in color.  The view of the window overlooking the tall buildings of the city is a great prop.  The lighting outside darkens as the evening progresses and the flashing neon lights come into the apartment.  It was a great set up to watch develop.  One of the famous scenes happens as the characters continue to talk but the camera stays behind the actors where none of them is visible and focuses on the maid who cleans up the chest and is about to put books away into the chest where the body of the victim lies.\n\nSomething that crossed my mind, but I ignored, was the possibility that the two characters were lovers.  The screenwriter asserted this point and it was fascinating to reconsider the entire relationship between the two main characters as well as their plans to take a trip to a country home.  The screenwriter felt that this film was the most effective film in providing two homosexual characters a deserved storyline.  It is fascinating to think in those terms and see how effective the whole film is underneath the initial layers.  \n\nA great Hitchcock drama that includes great dialogue for fans of stage plays.  This was the first and last time that anyone tried to shoot a movie and make it seem like it was just one long shot; that is one of the reasons why this film stands out.  Stewart and all the other actors deliver great performances.  The main character reminded me of Ben Affleck for some reason.",

Some aspects of the film seem to play out as a blue print for Rear Window. Not only do we have detective Jimmy Stewart in an apartment, but in addition the window scenery in this was superb! I do love Stewart with Hitchcock they always make a great team, but this time I couldn't take Stewart as a character, but instead just the actor. The true star here was John Dall as Brandon, he made himself an arrogant and cocky prick, rather brilliantly. This didn't have the full suspense I expect from Hitch, since this felt obvious, but it is wonderful in technicals.\n3 stars++",

They experiment the thrill of the murder and justify their behaviour by classifying human beings as superior and inferiors. According to them superiors can do away with inferiors any way they like. They excell themselves when they throw a party after the killing took place hiding the body in the furniture in front of the room! A very intelligent former teacher joins the party and realises that something is wrong. Very wrong!\n\nI think this film would be better left as a play as it was originally. The adaptation is not excellent. The acting by John Dall and James Stewart are extraordinary.So is Farley Granger whom we will see again in Hitchcock's \"Strangers on a Train\".\n\nThe film is shot totaly in studio in the big saloon of the house with a wonderful artificial view of the city behind. The city lights glow as time passes by. Hitchcock shoots all the scenes in one take but due to technical problems of the era he cannot move from one scene to another after a given duration. He solves this problem by moving the camera to one actor's back thus momentarily dimming the view and then moving to next shooting scene.\n\nThe philosophical aspect of the film needs to be mentioned also. The importance of a human life is emphasised on and some arguments have been made leading up to Hitler's or Nietzsche's views. The inferior/superior human classification has been made through out history for political purposes mostly. The killers' claim to be superior beings is thwarted by their unaware philosophical mentor.\n\nTo summarise, not the best from the best. I would not watch it again especially.",

This time around, two friends strangle their classmate, hide his body in their apartment, and then proceed to invite his family, friends, and former teacher to prove to themselves that they committed the \"perfect murder.\" One thing I heard about this film way before actually watching it was that it was edited to appear as if it was filmed in a single take. While I had my reservations about this in BIRDMAN, where it often felt like a gimmick, it felt more natural here. As this was based on a stage play, the constantly roving camera helped it from feeling \"stagey.\" I also found the central conceit (at least to the two friends) of murder being an intellectually superior act quite interesting, and the way in which James Stewart's Rupert plays off of this was rather brilliant (as they were his theories to begin with). In general, I found the performances to be solid, although not spectacular (save from James Stewart, who is always a pleasure to watch). Hitchcock did an excellent job of staging the action and slowly building the tension regarding the big elephant in the middle of the room, so to speak. On a completely random side note, John Dall (who played Brandon) and Ben Affleck look a lot alike, to the point where kept on picturing the latter in a remake (which they should never do, by the way). Overall, I didn't find this as exciting as the last two Hitchcock films I watched (SABOTEUR and SHADOW OF A DOUBT), but it had a well-executed story and a solid technical construction.",

Apelando al suspenso como elemento estructural, la película toma como punto de partida un asesinato para ir generando más y más tensión en torno a la resolución (¿descubrirán a los asesinos o estos se saldrán con la suya?). \"El privilegio para unos pocos\" es una metáfora de la relación lúdica entre 2 personajes que cometen un crimen, varios personajes que no lo saben, y el espectador entre medio, como siempre, siendo testigo ocular de todo lo que sucede (y sucedió), todos testigos privilegiados de un hecho poco cotidiano. Así como Poe nos habla sobre la fuerza de la conciencia en El Corazón Delator, Hitchcock se sale con la suya explorando el territorio de la conciencia y el remordimiento en la sociedad de posguerra. El exceso de cálculo en la puesta en escena (técnicamente, la película es avanzada para la época, utilizando planos secuencia del largo de los rollos de película), le imprime una temporalidad real al total de la película, pero esto no aporta un salto cualitativo en comparación a una narración \"con cortes\".",

It's an 80 minute experience that feels longer than it is, and Hitchcock shot the film in a really interesting fashion. Hitchcock only used about ten takes throughout the whole film (if the trivia proves accurate), ranging from four to ten minutes. This fashion makes you feel like you're watching a play because of the one set, and the editing and how it looks like the film's just all ongoing. \n\nThe performances are pretty good from the majority of the cast, their performances feel genuine and not like they're in it for the money, John Dall and Farley Granger did a good job, and James Stewart stands out the most, though, with a really great performance. \n\nThe film could have been better paced, it isn't perfect but it's enjoyable. I caught it on TV, and it was an interesting experience, but if I saw it at a store I'm not sure if I'd buy the film, as I'm not sure if I'd be apt to experience this flick again anytime soon. \n\nThe film also stars Edith Evanson, Douglas Dick, Cedric Hardwicke, Joan Chandler, and Constance Collier (who I wish could have gotten strangled, she was so irritating, in the case that I am thinking of the correct annoying character).\n\nHitchcock really does deliver us an entertaining experience, with the way that he films the thing making it, and the performance given by Stewart, the most memorable aspects of the film.",

            "content": "You got to give Alfred Hitchcock credit for one aspect regarding his first Technicolor feature Rope (1948) and that is the honorable attempt at trying something different in terms of telling his story. With Rope, he tries to film the entire picture as if it were one seamlessly continuous take. Although I can clearly tell when the film may have been edited through close-ups of the backs of the character's suits, I at least respect what he's trying to attempt and that ambition alone is one of the best parts of this picture. The rest of Rope however, if you really think about it, is pretty boring especially by Hitchcock standards. \n\nWe start Rope with, no surprise, a murder which is committed by two college students. One of them (John Dall) has complete confidence that they have committed the perfect crime, the other (Farley Granger) does not and becomes rather nervous. Other than the fact that they've committed a crime, why is Granger so nervous? Because Dall had the very head-strong idea to invite the victim's family, their friends, and a detective (James Stewart) over for a dinner party to basically make sure their crime is basically untraceable. Yeah, no wonder Granger is so nervous. One might be so wise as to say this is a very unwise idea and that this effectively proves why pride is a sin in a scenario like this. \n\nAs you can probably tell, the story of Rope, while efficiently told at a running time of less than an hour and a half, is not really that interesting or groundbreaking. Hitchcock has basically told this type of story many times before and there's no real twists to this one to really make it stand out. Because there's no surprises, you can easily predict where the plot will go and you'd probably be right. \n\nThe characters in this film are also pretty lame with the exception of James Stewart since he recognizes how unpleasant this dinner party seems to be. There's nothing really wrong with these people, but I just don't find much in these characters that make them very memorable. They all just deliver whatever lines they have to say and just get off screen as soon as possible. Some of the conversations the characters have are relatively pointless, there's one conversation where they're talking about movie stars that immediately becomes distracting. \n\nOnce again, the only aspects about Rope that seem to work are its underlying ambition to make everything on screen feel like it's happening in real-time and James Stewart's performance. Aside from that, there isn't much here that will truly satisfy fans of Alfred Hitchcock. Maybe if its story had more plot turns or drama, I would be more impressed with the style Hitchcock was trying to go for here. As it is, Rope is an experiment that tries something new, but ultimately seldom delivers on its early promise.",

Based on a Patrick Hamilton's 1929 stage play, the film depicts two college friends executing a perfect murder and throwing a party to celebrate the morbid deed!\n\nRope focuses on Brandon (John Dall) and Philip (Farley Granger), two college chums sharing a New York apartment and a rather unhealthy superiority complex. To further stir up the setting, the two are most evidently a couple with Brandon being the more dominant in their relationship. Their superiority complex and obviously unhealthy relationship manifest in them murdering one of their \"inferior\" college friend, David Kentley for thrills. To celebrate their crime and to further prop up their egos', Brandon and Philip throw a party for their friends with David's body is tucked in a chest at the center of the party! Everything goes according to plan until Philip and Brandon's old school teacher, Rupert Cadell (James Stewart), start to suspect something is very wrong with the setting. \n\nRope is a catching mystery film and directed close to perfection which shows in a fact that the film is intense and interesting even if it takes place at a single setting. I however could not totally buy into the character setting of Rope: Brandon's lack of emotions and superior intellect fits the description of a psychopathic murderer, but Philip's panicky and submissive characteristic do not. That unless on interprets that Brandon's more dominant personality forces Philip to commit murder in the first place..? \n\nThe film is unique and thought invoking for sure, but for me Philip's unfitting characteristics for murderer  and some of the odd discussions during the party put me off slightly, resulting in a slightly lower than usual score for Alfred Hitchcock films.",

But the act itself is not enough for Brandon.

As the night wears on, dinner guest and old schoolmaster Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) becomes increasingly suspicious about Davidâ(TM)s whereabouts. â~Ropeâ(TM) attempts to capture the essence of the stage â\" shot on 10 reels edited together to give it the appearance of one take, entirely based in one room, and backdrop and lighting changes used to communicate the impression of the evening passing. However, it fails to capture the excitement of a live performance that only theatre can provide â\" they are very different media and unfortunately â~Ropeâ(TM) feels slightly shallow in its attempts to recreate the stage experience. The â~single takeâ(TM) approach does feel a bit like a gimmick â\" with the obvious cuts between reels creating a degree of distance from the drama. The impact that can be gained from close ups and a variety of angles is a loss as well, giving the film a very level tone throughout. Itâ(TM)s a fantastic set-up that could have been invested with a much higher degree of suspense if it hadnâ(TM)t constrained itself to the single shot, single room set up. Thatâ(TM)s not to say that â~Ropeâ(TM) is a failure as a piece of cinema. With some fantastically tense segments and outstanding performances it more than deserves a watch. John Dall is particularly memorable as the slippery, twisted Brandon, and Jimmy Stewart is solid in the â~good guyâ(TM) role. With its brief running time we donâ(TM)t get a chance to really delve into the boysâ(TM) characters and to fully understand their motivation â\" the Nietzschean concept of a âSupermanâ?, and the idea of intellectual superiority are briefly discussed â\" but this may be intentional as motive may be cloudy in their own minds as is often the case when young men commit violent crime for nothing more than a thrill. In the original theatre production Brandon and Philip (as well as Rupert) are all overtly gay â\" but this had to be watered down for 1940â~s Hollywood tastes (even removing uses of the word â~darlingâ(TM)) â\" and you canâ(TM)t help but think that if this subtext couldâ(TM)ve been played to slightly more the picture would have a great deal more depth as well as intrigue. Hitchcock described it himself as an âexperimentâ? and it deserves to be regarded as such â\" but it still remains a watchable thriller with some truly memorable scenes.",

            "content": "What Rope proves about Alfred Hitchcock, probably more than any of his other films prior to his classics like Vertigo and Psycho, is that he was truly a filmmaker ahead of his time. This taut, claustrophobic thriller may be one of his more underappreciated films, falling between his time working under Selznick, and his boon from the mid-50's onward. \n\nRope focuses on two college friends and a murder they commit right before they host a dinner party for friends of the murdered young man. The film takes place solely in their apartment and sees their dinner guests, consisting of the murdered man's girlfriend, father, aunt, former best friend, and their old boarding schoolmaster (Jimmy Stewart), drift in and out of the apartment. Hitchcock weaves together approximately 95% of the film's action in one seamless take, focussing on the movement in the room, for example, while the audience overhears a conversation. For 1948, this technique is certainly avant-garde and a clear preview to the likes of Robert Altman and David Mamet. \nHitchcock had already proved his ability to create a great thriller with films like The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes, Rebecca, Spellbound, and Notorious. But it is his artistic freedom with this picture and using the tension of the setting that really makes Rope a standout. He masterfully alludes the homosexual bond between the murders with great relish. The highlight of this allusion being right at the beginning after the murder is committed and the dialogue afterwards sounding like post-coital awkwardness (After Brandon turns the lights on, his partner-in-crime says \"No, leave them off\"). Being the late-1940s, it is shocking that such overt expressions of homosexuality got by unchecked. Thankfully, it did. And the film is better because of it as it adds sexual tension to the already claustrophobic and nerve-wracking situation presented.\n\nBased on a play, Hitch does the right thing in making the setting very much like a theatrical production and it adds to the tenseness. The audience is aware that the body is right there in the chest the entire time. With the guests all sitting around it talking philosophically about death, murder, and superiority within the human race, it adds a darkly comic element to the film. But when the maid starts clearing off the table, your heart starts racing as you think that the maid will stumble upon it blowing the whole macabre display wide open. Yet, it is the professor (a great Jimmy Stewart) who starts piecing things together and questioning the purpose of the dinner party.\n\nThe professor, unwittingly, had an influence on the boys to commit the murder. Part of his theory is that creatures, including man, are justified in killing each other to weed out the weak, a sort of social-Darwinist view on murder. When he finds out that his theories have been put into practice, he comes to grips with the effect of his ideas if they are put into practice.\n\nRope, then, is more than just a thriller. It is, in fact, a deep and layered film that only someone like Hitchcock could pull off in the 1940s. He cobbles together a tense, taut, and philosophic movie that also entertains and keeps the audience captivated. It's further of what everyone already knew about Hitchcock: he truly is the master of suspense.",

            "content": "\"Rope\" may not be the best story of all time, but it is darn impressive.  Hitchcock manipulates the screen into a stage with this film that creates the illusion of a single take.  Special effects and camera tricks have no place in this film as the story is told from a single camera angle taking place in an apartment.  \"Rope\" is unlike any other film that you will ever see.  It is amazing how much suspense develops without ever leaving the room.  This film is all about good acting.  Like \"Twelve Angry Men,\" the film's energy relies on the delivery of lines and subtle acting gestures.  John Dall's stutter is nothing short of genius, while Phillip Morgan's shifting eyes continually remind us of his guilt and paranoia at hosting this dinner party with a dead body in the room.  The subtlety of Jimmy Stewart picking up the wrong hat to solve the mystery is perfection, as no action is out of place in this film.  It is such a typical party, but so much more is going on.  Joan Chandler is lovely as Janet, the sweet but spunky fiancee, but my favorite character is definitely the flighty Mrs. Atwater.  Constance Collier brings the perfect amount of charm and confusion to the role.  The film is slow at times, often times using one-on-one dialogue to give the other actors a moment to rest before the long and uncut scene continues, but it still manages to tell this philosophical murder story in a room filled with people.  It must have been a sight to see, actors navigating over wires, walls moving in and out, and a crew constantly manipulating the set in a madly choreographed dance, all while the camera continued to roll.  Even though the film uses a single set, the skyline in the background is incredible with a sky that progresses from afternoon to night, clouds that move and change shape eight times throughout the film, and chimneys with smoke rising from them.  It also provides some symbolism as their master plan progresses from pure excitement to being caught, with the blinking light from the sign outside eventually illuminating them in red.  The film only allows for a few of Hitchcock's cool visuals, like when the door swings open and we see Dall dropping the rope into the drawer, but you can feel his hand on every inch of the film as his signature dark tone looms over the entire film.  Some might refer to this single take illusion as a gimmick, but it is just another testament to Hitchcock being one of the most innovative directors in the history of cinema.",

            "content": "Alfred Hitchcock's, \"Rope,\" is one of the more interesting films I have seen. It deals with the theory of the superhuman. Meaning \"what if\" people had the right to eliminate beings they believe to be inferior to them. How we could become a super species if these weaker strings no longer existed. Another theme the film deals with is the value of the human life. Who really has the power to judge, who lives and who doesn't. The film handles these themes with great care and real opens up discussion.\n\n            Directing is really where the film shines. Alfred Hitchcock gives away exactly what happens and who does it, but creates tension with characters and the fear of being discovered. He created a very real environment with real characters. The film progresses naturally and the editing is the highlight of the directing. There are only so many edits and the ones that are there are incredibly hard to notice. A lot of the shots are done in one take and it is credit to the director and actors to be patient and not losing character or flow because one mess up could have caused them to start over again. One scene flows into the other so seamlessly and adds to the feeling of actually being in the apartment with the characters.\n\n            Acting is fantastic and the characters are great with a lot of depth. The main characters are Rupert (Stewart), Philip (Granger), and Brandon (Dall). Rupert is the suspicious former teacher of Philip and Brandon. He suspects something is wrong and begins to snoop around. Stewart plays the character with class and a level of sophistication. Philip is the nervous wreck, who fears of being discovered for their crime. Granger is good as the character, he's nervous and his body language only adds to the character. The highlight of the film is Brandon, very smooth and intellectual, who believes he is a genius beyond compare. Dall is the character, he fast talking and sly. A lot of double play in what he says and knowing he is a murderer, he's very likable. The rest of the cast is great at what they do.\n\n            Overall, \"Rope\" is a great movie with fleshed out characters and wonderful writing. The characters are interesting and the acting is superb. The director adds the right amount of drama and tension to each scene and the editing immerses the audience into the event that is unfolding. The film also has incredible depth opening up discussion for future viewing. I give the film a very strong 4.5/5, strong characters enhanced with great direction, acting, and script.\n\n                                                                                   \"Fetch Status\"",

However, its remarkable unconventionality in the sense of play-like editing technique and the way its storyline is build should be sufficient enough to make it worth a view. I've always been amazed by Hitchcock's ability to render the element of suspense in such a jaw-dropping manner, that even when the viewer is fully aware that the dead body is lying in the piano for the whole time, he is still feeling the mysterious aura and experiences it along with the characters. Even though even James Stewart wasn't very fond of the movie himself, I still think that everyone, who wants to know the true Hitchcock, has to watch Rope.
