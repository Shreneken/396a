    "summary": "This classic film noir by John Huston stars Humphrey Bogart as World War II vet Frank McCloud. Visiting Key Largo to pay his respects to the family of his late war buddy, McCloud attempts to comfort his comrade's widow, Nora (Lauren Bacall), and father, James Temple (Lionel Barrymore), who operate a hotel. But McCloud realizes that mobsters, led by the infamous Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), are staying in the hotel. When the criminals take over the establishment, conflict is inevitable.",

            "content": "Fine, taught drama with superlative performances by Bogart, Robinson, and Bacall, along with able support from Barrymore and a sad, soulful Trevor.  Having the story unfold primarily within the confines of the hotel with the specter of a brewing hurricane merely adds to the feeling of suspense, with the inevitable climax uplifting and satisfying.  The tension and crisp dialogue between Robinson and Bogart is of particular interest as it magnifies the talent to these superb actors.",

            "content": "Recollections of Humphrey Bogart's legacy conjure up memories of some of the finest classics that cinema has ever offered; we thus tend to expect the highest caliber of material when exploring a Bogart work with a devoted fan base. In the case of \"Key Largo,\" I couldn't help feeling sorely let down, even though it may be unfair to expect every film to match the brilliance of a Casablanca or Sierra Madre. While admittedly partial to the chamber piece concept and the confined setting, \"Key Largo\" rolls out lengthy passages that feel shockingly uninspired, allocating an exhausting amount of time to the self-important pontifications of its tiresomely one-dimensional villain. While stylized and exaggerated noir-ish mannerisms can be expected to come with the territory and commonly exude their own kind of charm, they work to the film's disadvantage here, undermining the kind of palpable tension this material would require to function at the necessary height of suspense. Even the film's subtle commentary on the nature of heroics feels haphazardly developed, leaving us with an experience that bores us with its crude simplicity and unexceptional theatrics. While \"Key Largo\" boasts a strong cast and a winsome setting, it ultimately fails to deliver at the level of its content, and we are left frustrated and confused by its preceding acclaim.",

Claire Trevor won an Oscar for her role as a rather neurotic alcoholic, and I think that she adds depth so that the story does not devolve into just Bogey, the baddies, and Bacall being there as a love interest and not much else (though she is at least marginally more active in reality). The other characters themselves do not entirely excite in the way that one would hope, and some of the shift in Bacall and Bogart's performances seem sudden and poorly written. This is just a small gripe, though, in what is undoubtedly a worthy entry in any list of good \"films noirs\".",

            "content": "Key Largo is unique among the Bogart noirs in just how little it decides to focus on Bogart himself - once introduced, Robinson's Rocco becomes the focal point of the film, and that's not a complaint. Rocco's cruelty paired with his insecurities make him a great villain in this film, as his initial confidence is gradually eroded with the increasing intensity of the hurricane, and his mounting desperation gradually causes him to grasp at straws. While not perfectly executed, the gradually increasing tension from conflict in a single, confined location is a great premise and is still compellingly done here, though the film fizzles once it decides to abandon the Largo Hotel, plodding through a relatively predictable and low-energy finale after setting up the mortal stakes so well earlier on. Bacall's role is also strangely unimportant, seeming to fulfill the role of the romantic sideline as a formulaic formality rather than a vital component; Trevor is much more entertaining as the remorseful daydrunk wife of a gangster.

Nice to see Lionel Barrymore too, looking his age unfortunately. Maybe the wheelchair was necessary, I hope not. A taut claustrophobic story that drops you in the  action and offers you the choices and compromises the various characters have to make during the long hours. But its Robinson's film. His last great film before losing his edge. He's so entertaining and so 'right' in the part. If you had to be menaced by an old time gangster I bet  you'd choose Johnny Rocco. And as with the ending of Shane there's a nostalgia even a  sadness in his performance at his age for a way of life soon to be gone forever for the character and for the actor. Win or lose Johnny Rocco is doomed. We're all glad that Bogart triumphs in the end of course. He had to win but I always felt that, pragmatic though it was for him to do so,  it was just a little cold-blooded for him to shoot Edward G down from cover.",

Score by Max Steiner.\n\nBogart and Bacall's final film together may very well have been their best effort, though it's one tough call to make. Classic film noir with powerhouse cast, great b&w cinematography, outstanding screenplay by Huston and Richard Brooks, plus a superb musical score. Oscar winner Best Supporting Actress, Claire Trevor nails it as Robinson's alcoholic \"retiring\" moll. Lauren Bacall's dramatic performance as widow of WW2 soldier is a stand-out. Her emotional, understated, 'plain Jane' look (for one of the most beautiful women ever) in this role, she is at her best.\n\nEdward G. Robinson as the notorious gangster Johnny Rocco is equally unforgettable in probably one of his finest roles. Bogart and Robinson are terrific as adversaries. Bogie stars as Frank McCloud, a soldier who comes to Key Largo to visit slain friends family while vicious, fugitive gangster and crew are there with hurricane brewing. With an exciting climax on boat bound for Cuba.\n\nCrusty Lionel Barrymore plays a rather crusty Lionel Barrymore, and one who takes no... (blank).. from anyone. It is genuinely one of those films in which everything comes together in perfect succession. Great photography, outstanding atmosphere. A true classic. 10/10",

            "content": "Key Largo is a film noir piece set in the Florida Keys where Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) arrives to visit the family of a fellow soldier that died during the war (Lionel Berrymore and Lauren Bacall). Problems arise when the gangster Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson) has holed up the hotel run by the family, waiting to sneak back into the country after being deported. Add into this the hurricane that will be making a direct hit on the south Florida island.\n\n\nWhenever you get John Huston and Humphrey Bogart together you're going to get something special and Key Largo isn't any different. The film has a deep noir feel, yet it transplants itself from the typical locale of seedy neighborhoods of the inner cities to what was a more quiet area that becomes isolated even further by the hurricane hitting. Bogart is the reluctant hero, beaten down by the war and the post war world that wanders into this situation by accident. He's not looking for trouble, but is prepared to deal with it if necessary. There is an attraction between McCloud and Nora (Bacall, the groomless fiancé), but nothing really comes to fruition due to the situation they're in, giving us believably that wasn't seen in films of this era. There's too much going on for this people to become romantic. Other circumstances may allow it, but not this set. Of course, Edward G. Robinson playing an egocentric gangster is his calling card. He's great in the role and plays it over the top when needed, but still has the ability to tone it down when the situation requires.\n\n\nKey Largo is a movie that builds onto itself, with a kind of snowball effect that compounds itself as the film goes on. There is a sense of claustrophobia when the film begins, that opens up as the film rolls on right along as Johnny Rocco loses control of the situation. And yes, the hurricane represents a huge character in the film is the boss over all that it surveys. Huston plays this card, but doesn't over play it, a great move by a master. Key largo is one for the ages, a great noir piece that paces great with wonderful acting. A testament to all of those involved in the film.",

            "content": "What's so great about Film-noir's is that they thrust the audience into uncomfortable and alienating situations.  While Key Largo is in most ways a lighter noir, it still creates a great amount dread and ominous situations, all a tribute to John Huston's wonderful direction here.  \n\nKey Largo re-teamed Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall for the 4th and final time and it is yet another gem in their resumes.  Lionel Barrymore, Edward G. Robinson, and Claire Trevor round out a tremendously talented cast.  It helps that Key Largo is based on a play which gives the actors plenty of room to thrive in this crime drama film noir.  Trevor won the Oscar for supporting actress and she's incredible, but Barrymore never fails to amaze me in a wheelchair.  Between this, You Can't Take it With You, and It's a Wonderful Life, he has gave me some of the most enjoyable movie experiences, so thank you Mr. Barrymore.\n\nThe film delves into a man's (Bogart) post World War II trip to his friends hotel when they are stranded with a bunch of gangsters during a hurricane.  The premise itself thrives as a stage production by it also manages to give us an engaging and thrilling cinematic experience as well.  I love how there is never any real assurance from the writing or direction that this film will be a happy ending, which makes it such a great noir.  A hurricane and a bunch of gangsters?  The only actor qualified for such circumstances has to be the one and only Humphrey Bogart.\n\nIn all seriousness, Key Largo is a really good film.  With a setting that sticks to the confinement of the hotel for 90% of the film, I can't speak highly enough of the directing and acting.  It's difficult to make an action film with plenty of vivacious settings to be engaging for 90 minutes but Key Largo manages to it with one hotel, that's impressive.  The character arcs of both Robinson's Johnny Rocco and Bogart's Frank Mcloud are interestingly paralleled.  Both have nowhere to go or fit in and they both plenty of desires and hopes.  To me, the scenes between both of them were the most fascinating.  So overall, Key Largo is a classic.  It gives you everything you want from a noir standpoint, while also creating a solid crime thriller in the process.\n\n+Direction\n\n+Barrymore always steals the show\n\n+Noir elements\n\n8.7/10",

            "content": "There has been countless number of films based on the premise of innocent people being held hostage by a group of desperate criminals. Typically the genre most frequently trying to use this concept is horror although its best application produced one of the best film noir movies ever made, 'Key Largo'. Arguably one of the most powerful forces driving its box office during its initial release as stated in time, the appearance of the tabloid worthy couple of 40s, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, the sheer power contained in the script, stylistic direction and intense performances sure that this film will continue as the timeless classic. Warner Bros. has been continuing their 'Warner Archive Collection', reinvigorating movies such as this with a high definition remastering and released on Blu-ray. In this instance, 'Key Largo' has shared its release date with another Bogart/Bacall powerhouse, 'The Big Sleep'. Or both from certainly stand on their own merits and demand to be in any serious collection, watching the two together will provide a double feature that is enormously entertaining. From a historical perspective of the time of this films production Bogart had already married his mistress, Lauren Bacall, and this is the fourth and final film he made with her. Written and directed by one of the most powerfully creative been in the art cinema, John Huston, this movie stands as a lasting testament to how this man was able to elicit the best performances possible and even some of the most talented actors in film. With a cast as star-studded as this film, Huston demonstrated his rare ability to keep individual egos in check it still produce performances that would synergistically combine some of the most emotionally powerful scenes ever committed to film.\n\nFrank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) has recently concluded his military service coming achieve the rank of Major and is looking forward to returning home. First he had to discharge a lamentable but honorable duty, visit the family of a friend and subordinate, George Temple, who gave his life during the campaign in Italy. Frank arrives in the family owned hotel Key Largo Florida where he meets George's widow, Nora (Lauren Bacall) and his father, James (Lionel Barrymore), the owner of the hotel. His past the tourist season and there is a severe hurricane predicted to hit the area. The hotel has only six guests remaining; the stylish Toots (Harry Lewis), ill-mannered Curly (Thomas Gomez), stoic (William Haade), subservient Angel (Dan Seymour) and the attractive are clearly alcoholic young woman Gaye Dawn (Claire Trevor). The sixth member of the group remains mysteriously in his room never venturing out. Frank is not interested in engaging the men in conversation rather race of the opportunity when he can speak to Nora and James alone. He tells them stories of the bravery that George exhibited are close to became as friends under such conditions. Because of that Frank was able to recant minute details of his friend's wife and father-in-law. Nora mentions that George's letters frequently mentioned Frank in adaptable light and she becomes noticeably attracted to him.\n\nAs the storm draws closer the local sheriff, Ben Wade (Monte Blue), and his deputy, Clyde Sawyer (John Rodney) stops by to inform the temples that the pair of small time criminals, the Osceola brothers, has escaped custody. They are members of the local Seminole Indian tribe and James promises to use his influence with them to expedite their capture. Soon after the sheriff leaves the Seminoles arrives seeking shelter from the storm. The fugitive brothers are among them. Soon afterwards the men who had been staying at the hotel pull out their guns and hold Frank Nora and James hostage. As the situation intensifies the identity of the mysterious sixth man is revealed, violent crime boss, Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson). The savagery of this character is clearly depicted many with hosted drink from Gaye forcing him to sing if she wants it. After singing a song a cappella Johnny with hosted drink stating the performance was substandard humiliating public comments on her lack of talent and aging looks. In the scene that could only be as effective as it was with such incredible talent occurs when Frank pours himself a drink and gives one to Gaye. She eagerly accepted turning to him to say \"thank you fella\". Johnny steps in and viciously begins to slap Frank reminding him that he said she does not get a drink. Without reacting to the physical abuse Frank simply turns to the woman and replies, \"you're welcome.\" One of the trademark aspects of Humphrey Bogart's immeasurable talent is to portray a man who can exhibit exceptional strength under duress. Mr. Robinson had built much of his career portraying characters that were unrelentingly vicious and cruel. The see the two men in a scene that's a remarkably demonstrates these aspects of their abilities is certainly one of the highlights of the film but this movie has a chain did cinematic status by having a plethora of such moments.\n\nI never had the opportunity to see the play by Maxwell Anderson performed on stage. I'm certain it would be a fascinating experience. Many plays adapted to screenplays failed to capture the intimacy the stage affords the story. That is certainly not the case here. Co-authoring the screenplay with John Huston is Richard Brooks, Oscar-winning writer was provided Scripture such notable classics as 'Elmer Gantry', 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' and 'In Cold Blood'. Most of his scripts have one thing in common depicting people and ordinarily stressful situations. When combined with the incomparable John Huston the result is a film but not one scene is wasted, every moment is filled with subtleties brought to life by the nuanced performances of some of the screens greatest actors. The central theme may be the class retrieving a modest heroic man and a megalomaniac criminal but underlying it all this is such a contest of wills pales in comparison to the indomitable force of nature as a hurricane which is bearing down on their location. This adds to the ever-increasing sense of claustrophobia impose not only by the limitations of the hotel by the ever worsening weather.\n\nThere's efficiency to the script that packs an incredible amount incredible amount of character development and exposition in every page of dialogue. In lesser hands then the co-authors the story would have undoubtedly meandered only to collapse in on itself. This is where the triple threat known as John Huston saves the day. He is an experienced actor of unparalleled ability she is able to tap into as he writes his scripts. As a director he knows best how to connect with the actors enabling them to translate the written word into a mesmerizing performance. When you have an actor of such status as Lionel Barrymore the results are fated to be incredible. Mr. Barrymore was largely confined to a wheelchair in his hand severely crippled by arthritis. Several scenes he is challenging his actual physical agony into his performance utilizing his own personal suffering to enhance the portrayal of his character. This is simply put a movie that help to define film noir is one of the most popular genres of its time.",

The film is intimate and simple: sullen characters are stuck inside a creaky hotel during a storm, whilst Edward G. Robinson chomps cigars and breaks faces with words. Huston positions his stars and stories wisely, and squeezes every last drop of anxiety out of this sweaty scenario.\nClaire Trevor bagged the 1948 Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her turn as Robinson's drink-deprived moll. But it's Robinson who really steals the show, running rings around a handicapped Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, and dishing out grimaces that'd cause cage fighters to recoil and weep.\nKey Largo is some of Huston's finest and most atmospheric work; a tense crossover flick not easily forgotten.",

The movie is very compact, and feels like it is merely a stage play captured on camera. Almost every scene takes place on one of 2 sets, and most of the film is built around verbal sparring rather than physical action. As a result I felt the film was a bit uninteresting, because I never felt much escalation in tension. However, what holds it together and kept me engaged was the acting performances. Surprisingly the 2 biggest names, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, offered the mildest performances. It was really Edward G. Robinson as the perfect image of a 1940s gangster, Lionel Barrymore as the big-talking old man, and Claire Trevor as the alcoholic gun moll that stole the show. I particularly liked how this film played with the concepts of what makes up real strength, by showing scenes where the guys with the guns are not the strongest individuals in the room. If they had played with that more, and even used that in the final climax I think this could have been an even more effective film. Instead they added a strange side plot about the Native Americans that lived in that region, which I didn't feel worked all that well in combination with the rest of the story. I can see why Key Largo was a classic that resonated with 40s audiences, but aside from some solid acting, I would say this is a film that doesn't really stand the test of time.",

This film is, in every sense, an ensemble piece, and it is the picture's ensemble cast which, sixty-five years after its release, make it worth remembering.\nThere's Edward G. Robinson as the brash, boisterous expatriate gangster Johnny Rocco. His performance slowly reveals a man yearning for a time bygone. Lionel Barrymore is the infirm but nonetheless crusty hotel owner James Temple, who is overcome with venom when Rocco takes the hotel's inhabitants hostage. Claire Trevor is the alcoholic moll whose best days are well past, symbolic of Johnny Rocco's own decline.  \nHolding this group together are the aforementioned star couple, from whom director John Huston coaxes brilliantly subtle performances that avoid any potential for scenery-chewing. \nSo subtle is Bogart's performance that it is easy enough to overlook the sophistication of Frank McCloud's story. McCloud is a disillusioned vet who pays a visit to James Temple, and his daughter, respectively the father and widow of a fallen soldier whose bravery he had admired. Unlike so many other American memories of the Second World War that are proud and triumphant, this story more accurately portrays the feelings of a generation of young men returning home from the greatest conflict the world has ever known.",

            "content": "\"Give him a drink. Give him a drink. GIVE HIM A DRINK!\"\r\n\r\nBy the late 1940's director John Huston was on a roll. He scored two huge hits, The Maltese Falcon and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and won some Oscars. His 1948 film, however, Key Largo, despite it's huge cast, was a box-office disappointment, but nowadays, it's viewed as a classic. What do I think? Well, Key Largo is pretty entertaining and is a John Huston film worth watching.\r\n\r\nWar leader Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart), bitter over his time in WWII, heads to the island of Key Largo, and stops at the island's run-down hotel to pay respects to owner Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall), whose husband (and McCloud's friend) was killed in the war. He soon discovers that the hotel is taken over by gangsters, led by the notorious Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), who intends to make a comeback after a time of exile. While a heavy hurricane is brewing outside, Rocco intends to use money brought by a mobster contact in order to make his comeback as a gangster. McCloud, despite being bitter about the war, realizes Rocco to be a monster and has to man up in order to defeat him.\r\n\r\nAlso, Lionel Barrymore plays James Temple, father-in-law of Nora Temple, Claire Trevor plays Gaye Dawn, an alcohol addict who's also mistress of Rocco, John Rodney plays Sawyer, a police deputy who's caught in Rocco's situation, and Marc Lawrence plays Ziggy, Rocco's contact.\r\n\r\nJohn Huston is a talented director, but has made some misfires, such as Moby Dick. Here, he delivers. Key Largo is a very suspenseful and thrilling film. To start off, the casting is brilliant. Humphrey Bogart is smart and well-cast as McCloud, the bitter war veteran, Lauren Bacall is attractive and sassy as the hotel owner (she and Bogart wee married in real life at this point), Lionel Barrymore is chilling and amazing as the wheelchair-bound father-in-law, Claire Trevor is fun and disturbing as the alcohol addict (the scene where she sings \"Moanin' Low\" just to get more drunk is brilliant), and Edward G. Robinson is perfect in the role as Johnny Rocco. If you've seen him in the gangster film Little Caesar, then you know how menacing he can be in these roles. Here, he's brilliant. Johnny Rocco is just a catchy name.\r\n\r\nThe suspense in Key Largo is brilliant. The hurricane scene is chilling, Robinson's Rocco threatens to kill, and the climatic scene with Bogart and Robinson on a boat is suspense at its finest. The score, composed by Max Steiner, adds tension to the already suspenseful scenes.\r\n\r\nWith all this praise, you'd think I'd give this 100%, right? Wrong. There were a few flaws I had with the film. First, Rocco's sidekicks were bland and poorly developed. One, Toots, was so annoying in his laughs that I kept thinking that Rocco should go solo. Another, the pacing was a little slow in places. The beginning scenes with Bogart and Bacall were a little dull to watch, although their chemistry was great. I also didn't get the subplot about police chasing after \"Indian criminals\"? Seriously, what was that all about? Except for a key scene involving Rocco's terror, the Indian subplot had literally nothing to do with the film and was distracting from the main plot, which was much more suspenseful.\r\n\r\nDespite the film's occasional slow pacing and annoying subplots, Key Largo is a brilliantly suspenseful film and is a Huston film worth watching, with brilliant acting, especially from Bogart and Robinson, and some suspenseful thrills.\r\n\r\n\"I bet Prohibition will be back in 2 or 3 years.\"\r\nYeah like that happened.",

The hurricane adds in an extra tension, as the guy in charge is now scared that the hurricane could kill him. Each of the main characters has depth and it makes it all the more intriguing.

            "content": "John Huston's KEY LARGO [1948]: Not long after the brilliant triple Oscar winning film THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE hit the box office in 1948, the film did poorly despite the extremely positive feedback from critics & the limited audience that saw it. The star of that film Humphrey Bogart even remarked that THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE had \"An intelligent script, beautifully directed-something different-and the public turned a cold shoulder on it\", for Bogart's close Friend and favorite director John Huston who's big Hollywood comeback after World War Two depended on the success of the film, despite becoming a critically acclaimed director needed to produce a film that would bring in dollars at the box office. So adapting Maxwell Anderson's 1939 Broadway Play KEY LARGO to the big screen, having the Bogart & Lauren Bacall romance on-screen for the fourth and final time, having the legendary Edward G. Robinson starring as a villainous Gangster and under the scripting and direction of Huston, KEY LARGO the 1948 film was a box-office success. \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUMPHREY BOGART FORTNIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nDay Five: John Huston's KEY LARGO [1948]: As a hurricane swells on the Florida Keys isle of Key Largo outside a hotel were an intense situation swells between the hostages and captors, the simple but effective Film-Noir thriller KEY LARGO holds up well over 63 years after it was released. Having the iconic Bogart play a hero reluctant to stand up for a cause until later on in the film, having Bacall playing the strong spirited love interest and having Edward. G. Robinson playing a diabolical gangster, this Bogart starring and John Huston directed feature might not be on par with the likes of THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE [1948] or THE MALTESE FALCON [1941]. However it's striking and effective atmosphere, brilliant performances and stunning direction and cinema-photography makes this thriller a must see film starring Bogart. In the fifth instalment of my Humphrey Bogart marathon I'm taking a look at brilliant KEY LARGO today.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLOTLINE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen ex- U.S Army Major and World War Two Veteran Frank Mc Cloud (Bogart) passes through the Florida Keys he stops on the Isle of Key Largo to visit the family of a heroic solider he was once commanding officer of. Arriving at the Largo Hotel to meet the owner and father of the dead solider, the shady guests for some reason try to get him to leave. When Frank tells the guest why he is there, they tell inform him of were Mr Temple (Lionel Barrymore) and his daughter-in-law Nora (Lauren Bacall) are. After meeting with the pair about their heroic relative, Frank decides to leave but upon the instance of the pair, Frank becomes a guest of the hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the shady guests that previously troubled Frank try to act friendly towards him (even though Frank doesn't trust them). When the warning for a Hurricane that will soon bare down on The Keys comes to light, Frank, Nora and the disabled Mr Temple get ready for the storm when the phone rings. It turns out to be the police that are inquiring about the fugitives on the run, the shady guest turn out to be gangsters, the group become hostages. When the top and notorious gangster Johnny Rocco (Robinson), the leader of the crooks comes out of his hotel room the situation becomes really intense when the hurricane hits the Isle. Frank after seeing the brutal treatment of most of the hostages must overcome his doubts about being brave to save the day. \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACTING, SCRIPTING, DIRECTION, & THE CINEMA-PHOTOGRAPHY\r\n  \r\nThe performances in this film are just brilliant, and after all the entire plot demanded a strong cast to make the scenario work onscreen. Bogart who had played many reluctant heroes in numerous films gave a very good performance as the reluctant Frank McCloud. And after all as the focus of this review marathon Bogart might be the centre of attention, however the performance by Edward. G. Robinson is on par with Bogart. In fact Bogart had starred in close to four of Robinson's films by the time the two starred onscreen in this film for the last time. Robinson much like James Cagney became iconic for their numerous performances as gangster characters. Robinson gave another great performance in a role he became known for as a crooked Gangster. Bacall who had played many of the strong female romantic leads, especially in three of her previous roles alongside her husband Bogart gave another fine performance alongside her husband. The one notable thing amongst this great cast was that actress Claire Trevor who played Rocco's alcoholic and depressed lover Gaye Dawn won the best supporting Oscar for her role in this film, and all I can say is that she deserved it.\r\n\r\nJohn Huston who co-wrote the screenplay to the film and directed the film was an iconic director in the Film-Noir style. Huston's direction of the cast and the use of claustrophobic black and white close ups in several intense scenes really helps to build the atmosphere and of course that brilliant tension alongside the casts terrific performances makes this film a good thrill ride. \r\n\r\nThe sign of a very good or great film is how well it works onscreen, Huston's adaptation of a stage play despite the story's enclosed setting works well onscreen. Overall KEY LARGO is one hell of a good John Huston directed and Bogart, Bacall & Robinson starring film that still holds up against the test of time. My rating for this classic film is a solid 80%.",

There are some incredibly jarring closeups of Robinson during a monologue in which his face is being shaved.  This is the most memorable scene in the entire film even though it probably wasn't intended to be.  \n\nJust like he did in The Maltese Falcon, John Huston uses his homeland better than any other filmmaker of his generation.  This time we see the unfair eye the rest of the country had of soldiers from the war.  Frank McCloud (Bogart) never asked to be seen as a hero and only wishes to continue his life, but not one character in this film lets him forget what he did, even though they have no idea what that exactly is.",

            "content": "Tensions escalate as the lives of several people are threatened in a hotel in Florida at the break of an angry hurricane. The people (including a veteran played by Humphrey Bogart) have no choice but the stomach the demands the notorious Johnny Rocco has for them. Frank McCloud, the veteran, only came to the hotel to pay respects to his friends old girlfriend (Lauren Bacall) and was caught at a bad time. In addition, the gangster and his crew also hold the hotel manager (Lionel Barrymore) hostage and at gunpoint; waiting for their gangster friends to arrive with money for an exchange. I wish I could say this was a film that had an impressive all-star cast and left me on the edge of my seat with sharp performances and sheer thrills, but it isn't. Quite honestly, the film has't aged very well, and when you look at the disclaimer the film heeds in the trailer (suitable for adults only!) you can't help but chuckle. \n\nThat's not to say the chemistry between Bogart, Bacall, and Robinson were bad, but they certainly weren't their greatest performances. This is Edward G. Robinson in ANOTHER gangster role he was \"born\" to play. A stout, but mean mobster with a gun and Cuban cigar. Bogart was no exception. While he maintained convincing composure under stress and at gunpoint he almost seemed a little too relaxed. Whether that be due to the fact that he was with his lover, Bacall, or because the mere idea of them being onscreen together would get him a hefty paycheck, I don't know. There were a few good scenes with Bogart and that natural tough-guy attitude he always bestows. In one scene he has Robinson shitting his pants for fear of the hurricane hitting fast. Of course, this was just a way to stall to try and call the police and let the Indians in from outside. When the storm does pass they simply walk right in and exchange a few dirty words and puzzled looks. It's quite comical, and I don't know what John Huston was going for. \n\nThere is no final showdown or face off between the good guy and bad guy; just Bogart leaning over from the roof of a boat picking off Robinson's men like a coward. All Robinson has to do is look up and the movie would've taken a completely different tone. But of course, good triumphs over evil and when Bogart comes back safely we realize what we just saw of Bogart shooting at Robinson's men is closer to Ernest Hemingway's \"To Have and Have Not\" then the actual film was. \n\n\"Key Largo\" has got some entertaining dialogue and moments between characters, and there is so much build up to the climax but no payoff. I was underwhelmed at the action that DID happen and cared less for the romance between Bogie and Bacall. Looking back at this film now it's easy to see how it was just another Hollywood ploy for getting the two star-crossed lovers on screen for fans to go wild. Is it entertainment? Yes. Does it make money? Yes. Is it very good? No. And not even impressive for John Huston.   I wouldn't trade a cent of my money to see go to the island of Key Largo with a cast of characters who prove to me they're nothing more than an insatiable bore.",

He is great here and brings real menace but also a complete character to the proceedings.

The story is from a different time and I guess it required less development to explain the protagonists actions.  That said, the strength of this film lies in the performances of it's actors and the direction of Huston.  Edward G Robinson is outstanding as Johnny Rocco.  His performance is a forerunner to the role Cagney would later play as Cody Jarrett in White Heat.  Robinson infuses his performance with nastiness yet at the same time shows a deep vulnerability, a weakness psychologically for Rocco.  Lionel Barrymore is good as the father, Bacall is solid and Claire Trevor is damn good as well.  Bogart is remarkable to me in that as an actor he gets so much out of doing so little.  In fact one thing that stood out from all these actors is what their faces do and say with so little.  As for Huston, again quality work and I particularly like that you really start seeing a departure from classical Hollywood cinematography and shot composition.  If the so try had been stronger this would have been one of those classics that we always talk about.",

Then, to cap it off, they had amazingly talented actors who owned their roles.\r\n\r\nI've seen a handful of Bogart's films, and his low key portrayal of the wandering war hero Frank McCloud appears to be out of the ordinary for him.  No problem for one of the old masters, though.  Edward G. Robinson is bigger than life as Johnny Rocco, and his henchmen, despite their lesser roles, are right there with him.  It was early in the career of Lauren Bacall, but Largo shows off her mysterious looks.  Lionel Barrymore tops it all off as the hotel's proprietor.    \r\n\r\nThe themes are obvious, and there are few true surprises.  A raw lesson in true courage shines through in end, overshadowing the multiple tragedies within the film.  Somehow, as dark as it gets, Key Largo gives us hope that good always eventually prevails over evil, as long as we are willing to accept painful losses along the way.",

Frank has travelled to the Florida Keys to visit the widow of a friend from his unit played by Lauren Bacall who runs a small hotel with her wheelchair bound father-in-law played by Lionel Barrymore (Mr. Potter from It's a Wonderful Life). Unfortunately, a notorious gangster Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), along with his men, and the prototypical gangster moll (Claire Trevor in an Oscar winning performance) have also stopped at the hotel. The final complication is a powerful hurricane which is bearing down on the area.\r\n\r\nThe performances alone from Bogart, Bacall, Robinson, Trevor and Barrymore make this a film worthy of attention. The role's may be typecast with Bogart and Bacall playing recognizable roles that also find them in love, Edward G. Robinson playing a gangster and Lionel Barrymore playing the somewhat cantankerous old man but these performers are wonderful in their roles. But it is Claire Trevor as the alcoholic and abused Gaye Dawn who gives perhaps the most impressive performance in a role that could easily be expected to have been secondary. The film is directed with considerable flair by John Huston.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on a play by noted playwright Maxwell Anderson but takes considerable liberties with its source material, the ending is actually taken from another Bogart and Bacall pairing \"To Have and Have Not\" which was not used in that film and was provided to Huston by that films director Howard Hawks.\r\n\r\nThis film was the fourth and final pairing of Bogart and Bacall on screen and this is unfortunate because the interaction between the two which is perhaps heightened by their real life love affair is always effective.\r\n\r\nTypical of the era the film was made entirely on the Warner Brothers back lot but this certainly didn't affect the impact of the film for me.",

McCloud served in the war with Mr. Temple's son, and while passing through the area, has stopped to pay his respects to the family.  Meanwhile, the local police are on a manhunt for some indians who have escaped from the local jail (even though they're only serving a 30 day sentence).  By the time the thugs reveal themselves to be the gang of exiled mob boss Johnny Rocco, and ready to hold the hotel hostage, it's time for the hurricane to hit and all hell to break loose.  Key Largo is packed with intensity, both manmade and that made by mother nature.  Lauren Becall plays Nora like a wounded bird, wanting to believe in the good of man but willing to scratch the eyes out of any evil-doer that threatens her.  She absolutely worships strength in her men.  Bogart's McCloud is a survivor, but it's a constant struggle to follow his mind and not his heart.  There's a moment when he's branded a coward by the room, and while his words say he'd rather be a live coward than a dead hero, his eyes tell the story of a man who'd like nothing better than to prove everyone wrong.  And that's really where the bulk of this movie's strength lies, in performances and the use of non-verbal communication to tell a story far more subtle than the surface suggests.  That sublety doesn't extend to Edward G. Robinson's performance, however, as he chews the scenery in his role as the charmingly ruthless and vicious mob boss.  In one scene, he tortures Gaye, an old flame of his, with memories of a singing career she once had before booze took over her life and ruined her voice.  He offers her a drink in exchange for a song, gently chiding her into singing although she is clearly tortured by the prospect.  As she sings, the camera pans around around the room to the faces of the uncomfortable audience being held captive by Rocco.  After the ackward performance, Rocco disgustedly denies her a drink, considering her like some lowly animal.  It's quite a scene and quite a good movie.  In fact, I'd say it was nearly flawless.",

Robinson was annoying; the rest were great though.  Bacall also lacked screen time.  Bogart's character is typical of the ones he plays (Harry Morgan, Rick Blaine, etc.) as someone reluctant to do the right thing although his principles are always on the side of good.  Interesting story but it could have been fleshed out a bit more.",

            "content": "[color=Cyan]After the second World War, former army major Frank McCloud decides to visit the family of a soldier and friend who fought and died bravely in his battalion.  The boy's father, Mr. Temple, owns a run-down hotel on the island of Key Largo, which the soldier's widow helps him run.  Despite the hotel being closed, McCloud notices that there are several interesting guests, from the drunken Ms. Gaye Dawn to the inquisitive Curly to the watchful Toots and the unseen \"Mr. Brown\".  These guests offered a fair amount of money that Mr. Temple couldn't turn down and thus earned their stay.  Eventually, Mr. Brown is revealed to be outlawed gangster Johnny Rocco, who has set up camp briefly at the Hotel Largo to complete a deal he has made with a fellow gangster, but a storm is on the way, and things begin to turn south for all involved.[/color]\n [center][img]http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b89/RetroAnglophile/Random%20Movie%20Pics/KeyLargo001.jpg[/img]\n [/center]\n[color=Cyan] Based upon the play under the same title, [i]Key Largo[/i] is a wonderful film noir, but without the messiness of most in the genre.  It's easy to see the play bleed through on film because of the small scale of the film - it takes place all in one building, and relatively all within a short time span of ten hours - or one night.  And it is this simplicity of place, time, cast and its obvious line between good and evil, that makes [i]Key Largo[/i] so enjoyable.  [i]Key Largo[/i] also does a good job that no man, no matter how powerful or how many hired gunmen he has, he is always powerless against the forces of nature.  Normally tough and ruthless, Rocco is brought to his knees as the hurricane rolls across the old hotel, threatening the lives of everyone.[/color]\n \n[color=Cyan] The acting is top notch, and you forget that gentle Mr. Temple is played by the same man who played evil Mr. Potter in the Christmas classic, [i]It's a Wonderful Life[/i] - Lionel Barrymore.  Lauren Bacall stars as the widow Temple, who has a rather obvious lust toward McCloud.  Bacall stars with her husband, Humphrey Bogart (the two married in 1945, with a 25 year age gap between the two).  Despite all the great movies Bogart was in, it is very hard for me to enjoy Bogart himself, simply because I don't think he's that great.  Why would I, of all people, slam such an acclaimed classic actor?  Well, for the simple fact that Bogart only has one character, and it is impossible to see him as his character - the man is always just Bogart.[/color]\n \n[color=Cyan] I do highly recommend [i]Key Largo[/i].  I would put it in the top five on Bogart films, because despite the references to prohibition, WWII, and gangsters, its plot and characters hold up well over time, creating an enjoyable plot to prove its worth in the test of time.[/color]",
