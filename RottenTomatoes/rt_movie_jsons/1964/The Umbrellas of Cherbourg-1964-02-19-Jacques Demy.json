    "summary": "Geneviève (Catherine Deneuve), a beautiful young Frenchwoman who works at a small-town boutique selling umbrellas, falls for dashing mechanic Guy (Nino Castelnuovo). Their brief romance is interrupted when Guy is drafted to serve in the Algerian War. Though pregnant by Guy, Geneviève marries an older businessman, Roland (Marc Michel), and begins to move on with her life. Throughout the musical film, all the characters' dialogue is conveyed through song.",

At its heart, it is sad love story that is very French in its tone and themes.  This was my first musical that had absolutely no dialogue, but somehow it works. Apparently, it was the inspiration behind La La Land. Recommended.",

            "content": "\"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\" dialog is entirely rendered in clear French singsong by every cast member. Young Catherine Deneuve portrays a lovesick teen who appears in nearly every scene, summer and winter, coiffed with hair bows and wearing a beautiful wardrobe. She and her grasping mother run a small umbrella boutique on a little side street.  The vibrant color palette of the film throbs with jarring wallpaper patterns which often match clothing - hot Mexican pinks and French medium blues and Matisse-hot-reds-and-pinks and green stripes with pulsing polka dots and blue-green-fuscia floral patterns. Meanwhile the beau works in a greasy jazz-loud auto repair shop with a demanding clientele.  \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\" is not for everyone and I think there could have been at least some spoken dialog as in \"West Side Story,\" also a 1960s musical.  At least two familiar melodies are sung in \"Umbrellas of Cherbourg\" - \"If It Takes Forever I Will Wait For You\" and \"See What Happens.\"",

The background music does amplify a bit the emotional intensity of the movie, directing one's sensitivity to the scene. Sometimes a bit uncalled for; it's never too much, although all scenes have a hint of melodramatic tone.  In fact every scene has a flavor of an impressionist painting. Even if we have experienced  and heard all stories before, this one is so carefully executed that everything acquires a different gravitas. You've heard it before, but now do listen. You've seen it before, but now do look.  Catherine Deneuve and Nico Castelbueno are adorable in this movie.",

But watching the trailer for this, I thought it might be one of the occasional exceptions to the rule. And it was somewhat.\nI still found a good bit of it overly cloying, precious, and even monotonous at times, even for its average run length.\nBut, I did find the ladies' singing impressive, especially Denueve's. She's one of the great treasures of cinema history. What I also had as much of an issue with were plot holes, most of all the one involving the letters. I know he was in the hospital for some time, but he could still write her. He mentions letter not being answered by Genevieve. But he also says her last letter had strange answers/responses to his questions. Seemed too confusing and unresolved for me. \nThere were some predictable plot lines, too, like Guy and Madeline getting together. And why were Guy and Genevieve so in love? They just were, apparently, which was enough for Demy. 2.7 stars",

The film gets more realistic as it goes. At the time, being unwed and having a baby out of wedlock was a much bigger deal and I'm sure women not working as much played a part. In the end, both characters go on to live a decent enough life and accept what has happened, but without their true love.

            "content": "I've been meaning to dive into Demy's filmography since hearing he had a huge impact on Chazelle's La La Land, with this one being singled out as the primary influence, that's not to mention it's often cited as Demy's chef-d'œuvre. Infused by jazz melodies as well as thumping percussion for an added flair, featuring eye-candy pastel-coloured set and costume design on full display, and cycling through seasons in a way thematically suggestive, Chazelle's musical is definitely not far removed from this one although each has its own approach to its distinct story. What grabbed my attention the most is how Demy progressively jettisons the fantastical, iridescent world in favour of an otherwise grounded one. From the opening sequence of an aerial view of raindrops pitter-pattering on cobble stones and the titular umbrellas, to the bold, bright colours, to the constant singing, Demy muster all technical tools, congregating to lend a lulling effect that sent me into a delightful stupor, and to kaleidoscopically play up the emotional union and jovial state of Geneviève and Guy who're enamored with each other.\n\nCherbourg is almost presented in pink, before giving to brown-ish and blue hues to emote Geneviève's feelings of forlorn and sadness respectively, and fuchsia and red to suggest warning and uncertainty, when Guy leaves to Algeria due to his conscription, leaving Geneviène facing a tough decision that threatens their relationship. Even colours brimming with joy at first, such as yellow, gradually wane and pale, giving way to some of their dull and faint derived shades. All these create melancholic undertones along the way that ground the film in reality while portending its bittersweet ending where there isn't a dry eye to be found. But The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a film of the of vicissitudes of life and how one has to resign to fate so long as latching onto hope becomes more and more difficult, and it's more than just a matter of counting the days.\n\nThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg is also of teenage love and recklessness, and it's here in particular where it sets itself apart from the rest with its sense of verisimilitude. \"People only die of love in movies,\" said Geneviène's mother who neither believes in love at a young age nor love at first sight. She's pragmatic and even cynical, and maybe that's her main impetus for wanting her daughter to get married to the wealthy jewellery merchant. Yet, her happiness at seeing her blear-eyed daughter a bit cheered up when handed a letter from her lover is real and indicative of a true motherly affection. Make no mistake, this is far from the flawless film I was expecting. The editing is a bit clunky, which shows most in the continuity of music. It also took me a while to adjust to the dialogue, entirely being recited and sung, but soon I started to appreciate the unconventional lyricism of it all. A visual and emotional stunner that's not to be missed by all the fools who dream and lovers of musicals in general.",

Those concerns quickly melted away as this film progressed as I realized that this was a one of a kind film.  In fact it is quite magical.  The sets and costume design, along with the setting creates a truly unique and wonderous film about timing and acting on ones love.  The world creates when we can love and sometimes love isn't enough.  The final scene is one of the most magical and sad ones that I've ever seen.  This should not be missed.",

I really hope the whole fucking movie isn't like this. I mean can't they just talk normally without singing? That's seems really silly to me. Like why'd they have to make a musical out of the whole damn thing? Why not just segments like Sound of Music? Catherine Deneuve is so pretty. Her performance was one of a kind.\n\nI feel like I would've liked the movie a lot more if they weren't singing all the goddamn time lol. The story itself is good, it's interesting and somewhat sad and dark with themes like having to go off to war and leaving the girl you love behind and not knowing what to do expecting a child and the father not being around. It is impressive though that they had that much music to go along for the whole movie. And that score at the very end of the movie with all the strings was so hauntingly beautiful. It definitely captured the feeling of heartbreak and loss of not being able to be with your true lover but also being able to move on (because one must move on). This is like one of the saddest and most depressing musicals I've ever seen lmao. Goddamn that was a sad story. At least they were each able to move on even though they're probably still hurting inside forever. Moral of the story here is: fuck war. They break people, split people apart, kill people. I don't know if I'd watch it again even though I liked it and I was thoroughly entertained. It's just too heartbreaking and sad and they sing the whole damn time lol. Other than that, I thought the story impacted me on a deep level.",

I rented it mainly because I had heard the music used in a skating routine and had also been told that the movie was wonderful. The music is beautiful, but that's about all this film has going for it. First thing you should know when watching this movie; there is NO spoken dialogue. It's ALL in song. You get used to it after a while, but it gives the movie a \"cheesy\" feel. Plus it's annoying! The storyline is predictable; boy and girl are in love; boy is drafted for two years and the girl says she'll wait for him. The scenery in \"Umbrellas\" didn't strike me as \"beautiful and breathtaking\" as everyone says. It just looks like cheap (and very bright) movie sets. This film would have been SO much better if it were a \"normal\" movie, with spoken words instead of the constant singing. Yes, it was filmed in 1964, but it LOOKS like it. I like movies with a more \"timeless\" appeal, even if it's apparent that they are from another era. If they had to have singing in this film, they should have made it a real musical, on the lines of \"My Fair Lady\". where there is both singing and speaking.",

Since I am relegated to reading the English captions, it wasn't hard to imagine this film without the music. The dialogue is never interrupted with any heart rending arias or other show-stopping songs. I wanted to get a sense of whether it was worth watching without the music. Maybe that's dumb - perhaps it's an essential thread that cannot be pulled out. But I think there was much more indeed. \nCatherine Deneuve is adorable as Genevieve, a 17 year old shop clerk in her mother's store, selling umbrellas. It's a real store, by the way; 13 Rue De Port, Cherbourg. She's in love with Guy (Nino Castelnuovo). Her mother is in bad financial straits, and Guy gets his draft notice for Algeria (the movie is set in 1957). The shop is rescued by Roland Cassard, who is always referred to by his full name. He eventually expresses his desire to marry Genevieve while Guy is still overseas. Emoting ensues.\nJacques Demy is known for his vibrant color choices, and I can't help but wonder if this film (1964) helped create the full color style of the 1960s, or just reflected it. For instance, the shop has pink wallpaper with thin green vertical stripes. In the flat that Genevieve shares with her mother, the wallpaper is the same, but the colors reversed. Their bold outfits clash outrageously with the other wallpapers. Guy's room is decorated in painfully bright deep blue, and he has a toy Esso station, in addition an two oil tanker models on the mantle, reflecting his job at a service station (that's what we used to call gas stations, kids. They did more than pump gas and sell Red Bull). \nThe war for Algerian independence, which ended in 1962, and Vietnam before that, were open wounds in France in 1964. I'm trying to imagine a similar American musical made in 1977 about Vietnam. It doesn't work. Americans no longer have the artistic capacity to transform national trauma into a whimsical artifice. But this isn't film confection, despite how it looks and sounds. That's the point. Demy layered those absurd elements over an otherwise bittersweet melodrama. I can't say why. \nHow much did Esso pay for all the product placement?",

Sadly, this movie did not work for me. The story is kind of depressing, and it is not all that original. The young lovers who must decide if their love can stand the test of time and distance, is a really old story structure (and frankly not one of my favorites.) I simply wasnt enjoying the way things unfolded, and I knew what it was all leading to long before the ending arrived. The one chance this movie had to elevate itself above its story is the fact that it was a musical, which I should love. Unfortunately, I cannot fathom why this was musical. There werent memorable or distinctive melodies. The dialogue wasnt lyrical to my ear at all. As far as that goes, Im willing to accept that something might have been lost in translation since theyre singing in French, but it felt so clunky. It almost came across like Jacques Demy just wrote a script intending it to be spoken, and then told the actors to make up a tune so they could sing their lines, and then figured out some orchestration to go with it later. Nothing clicked to make this feel like a musical, and after awhile I stopped even thinking of it that way and simply read the subtitles in my head as if they were spoken. I wouldnt say that The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a bad or unappealing film, but it was completely ineffective for me. But I must admit, Demy has an eye for gorgeous visuals, so if nothing else at least I was able to enjoy the fact that this is a beautiful movie to look at.",

The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a beautiful and melodramatic take on a French romance in musical form.   \n\nJust as it was the case with La La Land, I have a feeling this film will get better on repeated viewings.  With every word sung, and in a different language, sometimes it's difficult to follow what is being said and what the emotional intentions are of each word.  Watching romances in another language is always a fascinating experiment.  On one hand, you could say that the language doesn't ultimately matter because what is meant is often shown through facial expressions.  But at the same time, not being familiar with the native language can make it difficult to understand the exact tone of each spoken word.  After all, how do we really know how well the actors can act if you aren't familiar to their language?\n\nWith all that said, there's no escaping the beauty to The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.  Jacques Demy crafted this story in such a unique way, through imagery and framing devices.  Catherine Deneuve and Nino Castelnuovo resemble last year's Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone by being an honest and charismatic couple that you can root for.  Just the pure emotion that both of them pour into their characters is admiring.  Only, I wish we did get to see a little more of them doing things together, instead of just gush over each other through song after song.\n\nGetting lost in the music, colorful imagery, and dreamy sequences are probably why this film became so popular, and further inspired La La Land.  Although nothing really compares to the latter, 'Umbrellas' works on other levels because it's a contained, quiet, and sincere love story told through beautifully arranged musical numbers.  This is one for the ages.\n\n8.6/10",

Unabashedly romantic it's not simplistic. Much is made of the Deneuve debut; but in the story it's Madeleine (Ellen Farner) who is every good man's secret hope & desire, in character & beauty. Legrand's very familiar score hardly seems amenable to lyrics. But tho' repetitious at times, it does seem to work.\n\n\"La La Land's\" Chazelle says this film was a significant influence on him & it's pretty easy to see, including the is-it-a-happy-ending, or not storyline. Yet, \"Umbrellas\" is purer sugar. There are similarities in production & costume design, too. Speaking of costumes: \"Umbrellas\" styles seem timeless.\n\nAdmittedly not for most Trumplicans, the others who stick with it will be rewarded. Timothy's Review just below seems right-on ...",

A film that for all its reliance on the clichés of the Hollywood musical, surprises with its take on a pair of young lovers who learn that life is a bit more complicated than it all appears at first, and love doesnt conquer all.  While not everyone involved is a great singer, the music more than makes up for it.",

It's the lofty goal of throwing an audience into a world where life sings, and making them believe and be enchanted without a moment to catch their breath.\n\nThank you, Mr. Demy.

Sadly there is no dancing, but an incredibly moving story, songs that became American hits (Watch What Happens, I Will Wait For You) despite being sung in French in the film and an ending that still hits me right in the gut. European cinema in the 60's really figured out how to use color and Cherbourg is a prime example of this.",

The music is wonderful with I Will Wait for You being such a fantastic theme and the colors are vivid and extremely bright and those two factors made this movie such an interesting experience. It is a great example of a film that manages to transcend its familiar storyline and typical plot points with its refreshing approach - this time in the form of a musical and in its heartbreaking, immensely beautiful ending. The tone struggled at times, but the acting pair hair is so pretty and the film is such a moving visual as well as auditory experience and it's ultimately quite unforgettable.",

            "content": "I'm not very strong on classical music generally, or opera specifically. I don't really enjoy listening to grand opera, so I've never made much of a study of it.\n\nMy understanding of opera is that it's far more about the music, and the libretti are usually lame and cumbersome. The best illustration of this I've ever heard, which I read years ago in an essay on Slate.com, is the first line of the famous aria \"La Donna e Mobile\" from Rigoletto (You've heard it. Search for a version on YouTube if you need your memory refreshed). \n\nThe first line of the aria is the title, and it means \"The woman is fickle.\" The stressed syllables of the line are \"La\" and the first syllable of the word \"mobile.\" The writer of the essay noted \"The worst Tin Pan Alley hack wouldn't give so much weight to the definite article because he'd know it was the most insignificant word in the line. But Verdi? He couldn't give a hoot.\"\n\nThis is not an anomaly. The canon of grand opera is filled with banal, silly, poorly written lyrics. On top of this, most opera companies cast their roles based on the quality of the singers, and consequently, the acting is usually abysmal. Seriously, what's the attraction here? I would sign on to an argument that the American musical and Gilbert and Sullivan operettas are far superior art forms to grand opera.\n\nAll of this came to mind watching The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, which was a big sensation when it came out in 1964, winning the Grand Prix at Cannes, making Catherine Deneuve an international star and making Michel Legrand a major figure in popular music. It was a pretty audacious project, attempting to tell an entire story in music, with no spoken dialogue whatsoever. The only problem is, as far as I could tell, it failed every challenge this difficult task presented. It's not good drama, it's not good musical theater, and it's not even good opera, with its lower lyrical and acting standards.\n\nFirst of all, the story is simple and uninteresting - a couple of kids fall in love, and then they're disappointed by events, and then they move on. That's really literally all that happens. There are no great stakes to anyone's setbacks, everyone has a nice back-up plan, and it really couldn't be less moving or more banal.\n\nThe actors were all overdubbed by other singers, but the other singers weren't all that great. They hit the notes, but that's really all you could say for them. There is about one good melody in the whole movie, and it is redundantly played over and over, with little variation of interest. The performances are blandly unpassionate; the line \"I'll die if you leave\" is sung with about the same emotion and passion as \"Sit down and have some tea\" - that is to say, hardly any at all. The entire script would get an F from an Intro to Playwrighting course. There are no subtexts or foreshadowing or levels to the libretto at all. It's just a series of events that are exactly what they seem to be, and the only interesting thing about them is that they're sung - and not terribly well.\n\nThis was the best movie in the world in 1964, according to the Cannes jury? This wasn't even the best musical in 1964, because that was the year My Fair Lady came out. I mean, jeez, contrast and compare! Lerner and Loewe's score crushes Legrand and Jacques Demy's score in every way imaginable. But even without that, take the music out of My Fair Lady, and you've still got Pygmalion. Take the music out of Umbrellas of Cherbourg, and you've got a 2-page scenario of the dullest love story ever told.\n\nIn fact, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg wasn't even the best European musical of 1964, because that was the year A Hard Day's Night was released.",
