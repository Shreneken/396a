    "summary": "In this beloved musical, pompous phonetics professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) is so sure of his abilities that he takes it upon himself to transform a Cockney working-class girl into someone who can pass for a cultured member of high society. His subject turns out to be the lovely Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn), who agrees to speech lessons to improve her job prospects. Higgins and Eliza clash, then form an unlikely bond -- one that is threatened by an aristocratic suitor (Jeremy Brett).",

The acting by Rex Harrison is very charming and arrogant making for a very memorable performance along with a very charming and extremely well acted supporting cast. But without a doubt it is Audrey Hepburn who takes it to the next level and adds a level of sophistication, wit, and charm that makes the acting phenomenal and elevates the performances of everyone around her. Her & Rex Harrison have a very unique bubbly chemistry throughout the whole film that is largely responsible for the distinct charm of this film. The cinematography is always full of colors, epic scale, and charm. The editing and pacing are excellent feeling very modern and fast paced which is incredible as this never feels like a 3 hour film. The songs are across the board range from very good to outstanding with not  dud in the bunch. Every song is extremely well sung and the musical score is arguably besides Hepburn the best thing in the film as it oozes charm and sophistication. The plot is well done also, in the hands of a lesser cast and less skilled director this would never have been as excellent as it is. Without a doubt this is a All Time Classic. You don't even have to like musicals to enjoy watching this...It's That Good. One of my Favorite Musicals of All Time.",

            "content": "My Fair Lady, loosely based on George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalian was a film I saw recently, and I absolutely loved it, and I am 17. It wasn't just the acting, but also the overall look of the film and the music. Mind you, I saw the restored version.\n\nThe film looks exquisite, with stunning sets and truly luscious costumes. A prime example is the ballroom scene. Audrey Hepburn's dresses were also a marvel to look at. This was also helped by the superb cinematography, and the detailed direction, provided by George Cukor. The scene at the racetrack was one of my personal favourite scenes from the film. Oh, and the choreography is fabulous.\n\nThe script is witty and acerbic, with excellent scenes with the social commentary. The story is simple, but is well told, and fits the lengthy running time perfectly.\n\nThe music by Frederick Loewe is just outstanding. Asides from the costumes, the songs are ones that you hear once and never forget. Songs like I Could Have danced All Night, With a Little bit of Luck, Just You wait, Why Can't A Woman Be More Like A Man? and Wouldn't it be Loverly linger long into the memory, and are a joy to the ear. I loved the incidental music at the beginning, then again I am the sort of person who is raised on classical music, and appreciates music for what it is.\n\nThe performances also added a lot to the film; Rex Harrison was just superb as the cynical, misanthropic Professor Henry Higgins, who transforms Eliza Doolittle to the woman she is at the end of the film. The Belgian actress Audrey Hepburn is perfectly enchanting as Eliza, and Marnie Nixon provides her singing voice beautifully.(yes she was dubbed, and Audrey Hepburn is not a slut) There is solid support from Stanley Holloway and Gladys Cooper, and watch out for Sherlock Holmes actor Jeremy Brett as Freddy.\n\nIn conclusion, a truly beautiful film, that deserved all the praise it got, it is an amazing film, that is misunderstood. It is also a perfect treat for around Easter time. Honestly, for those who think it is the worst movie ever made, see something like Home Alone 4, the only film I can think of that deserves a minus rating, that's how terrible that film is. My Fair Lady gets a 10/10 from me, Bethany Cox.",

            "content": "A miserable sexist is mean to Audrey Hepburn for 3 hours.\n\nDirector George Cukor's romance musical drama My Fair Lady (1964) is perhaps the strangest production to ever come out of Hollywood. Casting actress Audrey Hepburn as the lead in a musical when she cannot sing, so they overdub her with the heavenly vocals of Marni Nixon. It's very distracting, especially when the rest of the cast cannot sing to save their lives at all. Also, Cukor's direction is all about this massive spectacle with little genuine emotion. He works well for polite society and comedy about the English language, but much of the humor is not funny as My Fair Lady is brutally mean-spirited, sexist in nature, and not romantic at all. \n\nWriter Alan Jay Lerner gave us multiple sexist songs about hating women, cruelly making fun of the poor, propping up traditional English values and grammar at the xenophobic expense of other languages and cultures. Cukor should have had the film follow Audrey Hepburn, not Rex Harrison's raving, misogynist linguist. It feels like a complete misfire.\n\nAudrey Hepburn saves My Fair Lady with her charming performance as a Cockney accented flower girl, who just wants a decent life that's not prostitution. She's so naturally beautiful and pleasant, but even her accent gets obnoxious. Why is everyone yelling nearly every line? Producers Jack L. Warner and James C. Katz should have cast a singer as the lead and a younger man as the professor. Hepburn was always getting cast opposite these old, fastidious men that are so unlikable. Rex Harrison can be funny here, but he's hardly handsome, charming, romantic, or nice. His character is never anything but a selfish, narcissist to the bitter end. Harrison's lead is never actually kind or loving. It's all harsh critiques and cruel jests at her expense. My Fair Lady is certainly not a romantic musical.\n\nEditor William H. Ziegler should have just cut out the entire father sideplots and much of the cruel torture and teachings. Why is My Fair Lady, which is supposed to be a romantic comedy, a whopping 3 hours of excess and ridicule? It's 170 minutes! I thought it was ending at the Intermission, but there was another 110 minutes left! Who cares about Harry Stradling Sr.'s pretty cinematography as the camera rarely lingers on Audrey Hepburn's lovely visage, as we're constantly following the ever complaining and rude Rex Harrison. Harrison was fantastic in Night Train to Munich, but in My Fair Lady he's easy to hate. I hate all of the side characters down to the last. Only Audrey is a nice person.\n\nCecil Beaton's production design is pretty for Harrison's cozy abode and his mother's lovely house. The street sets suck and look like a cheap play production. Gene Allen should have leaned into realism for his art direction instead of the more play-like sequences. George James Hopkins' set decoration has all these cool props and stylish furniture that looks lavish. Composer Frederick Loewe's score is absolutely lovely, but the song lyrics leave much to be desired. There's like 3 great musical songs here and the rest are the drunkard father boasting about hitting up his daughter for booze money or the sexist professor bragging about his language knowledge or belittling women. \n\nCecil Beaton's dazzling costumes create these brilliant dresses for Audrey Hepburn like her breathtaking white lace embroidered sundress for the garden party or the white ballroom gown for the Queen's high society ball. I found Audrey so cute in the final pink sundress. Gordon Bau's make-up makes Audrey even more adorable. What a movie to waste Audrey Hepburn of all actresses.",

I thought the movie had a fair story and commentary and it was actually my first time seeing a movie with Audrey Hepburn. It is easy to see why she was an icon of her time as most of the charisma in the movie is due to her committed performance.

If one recognizes that this is a quasi-sanitized version of Shaw's intent it becomes much more palatable as they sort of rush the reconciliation at the end anyway. What we're left with are some incredible acting performances and costumes along with some pretty catchy songs, though the setting of most of them doesn't leave much room for impressive choreography. I happen to like the plot regardless of the ending and found myself enraptured by Audrey, as this was the first movie I'd seen her in, so I'm giving this a high score mostly for my viewing experience rather than comparing its merits to its peers!",

Perhaps it's the lack of flashy choreography to distract me from the obvious sets, as though it was based off of a play or something.

Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) is a misogynistic linguistics tutor who uses the terribly cockney-accented flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) to sculpt a sophisticated, upper-class lady. She eventually grows understandably unhappy and calls out on him for taking advantage of her. George Bernard Shaw appropriated the Pygmalion myth and crafted it as a witty satire of high and low social classes in Victorian England. Despite the disapproval of Shaw and after his death, the play was turned into a musical on Broadway in 1956 with music and lyrics created by Frederick Loewe and Alan Jay Lerner. Eight years later, Warner Brothers bought the rights to the musical, recruited George Cukor to direct, casted one half of the original two starlets of the Broadway show and released one of their great films. The songs are terrific, with each one having a distinct rhythm, from waltz in \"Show Me\" to an upbeat tango in \"The Rain in Spain\" to formal march in \"Just You Wait\". The meek, but feisty Hepburn compliments greatly with stubborn, but flawed Harrison. I admire her for determination and prowess to get her point across as well as fight against her mistreatment. As far as I'm concerned My Fair Lady is probably the best musical based on a Greek fable ever made.\n\n(5 Dovers with Bloomin' Arses out of 5)",

My Fair Lady proves that this isn't so, taking a well-developed and touching but objectively dry (the narrative hinges on speech therapy and isn't exactly comedy-dense) piece of original material such as Pygmalion and transforming it completely. The musical accompaniment is not always integrated to the greatest degree, but is pervasively raucous and joyous; both the songs and dialogue are given life through excellent performances by Hepburn, Harrison, and an underrated Holloway.

She is much better when she is the lady and holds morals over Professor Higgins. The second part of the film is more interesting than the first part. Eliza not knowing her place in the world, like Frankenstein's monster. Higgins is a horrible person not understanding of people and their feelings. He takes all the credit for turning Eliza into a lady but still treats her like dirt. I hated his character and during the film his attitude did grate. Stanley Holloway is the stand out as he has the morals and honesty. He is funny and sounds natural. Rex Harrison won the best actor and I am convinced he didn't deserve it. He plays the arrogant, pompous and manipulative character with gusto, but he is so unlikable and at times very one dimensional. It's a nice contrast from Professor Higgins very dark brown old house to his mothers very white and modern house. Higgins is out of touch and can not see it. Eliza is the blossoming flower who deserves to be treated with respect, The ending disappointed me as Eliza is back in  his house. The last line where are my slippers just seems wrong compared to the last 30 minutes.",

            "content": "Don't waste your time with this dull, overlong mess of a movie musical that features a truly wretched lead performance. If you want a good Best Picture winning musical watch The Sound of Music (1965) or Gigi (1958) both of which feature some fantastic songs and compelling lead performances. I spent two hours and fifty minutes of my life watching this film and I don't feel like I took anything away from it other than the costumes and a fear of watching any other Audrey Hepburn film. The 1960s were a strange time for musicals as we got the classics Oliver! (1968) and Sweet Charity (1969) but both this film and West Side Story (1961) are overrated and lacking in the most important element of a great musical, the songs!\n\nSpeech therapist Henry Higgins, Rex Harrison, is a pompous man who takes on a cockney girl who sells flowers, Eliza Doolittle, Audrey Hepburn, as a client to win a bet that he would be able to train any women to become a high society figure. The two initially have disagreements but Eliza develops remarkably quickly and is able to speak with a perfect, posh accent as he takes her to a decadent social event. She attracts the attention of the wealthy Freddy Eynsford Hill, Jeremy Brett, but she has already fallen in love with Higgins. When he succeeds in winning the bet Eliza is shocked by how poorly he treats her and leaves to return to her old life but Higgins begins to feel a yearning for her.\n\nAs much as the film was flawed it was really Hepburn's performance that sunk the whole affair as she is simply awful as the cockney flower girl. Her accent is terrible as I never convinced that she was anything other than the eloquent movie star that she is and her overacting throughout, a staple of the musical genre, was not charming but instead irritating. She couldn't sing, dance or act in this role and she pales in comparison to even Natalie Wood who could at least play a role. She and Rex Harrison have very little chemistry and he is not a charming leading man and it seems rather odd that he would be the object of her affection. Neither of them were giving even passable performances and that made it very difficult to watch them for nearly three hours.\n\nI had issues with the length of The Sound of Music too but Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer both give great performances in their roles and have a beautiful chemistry that is utterly compelling. The other big issue with this film is the lack of catchy songs and the fact that they didn't progress the plot along in any way. Lerner and Lowe are no Rodgers and Hammerstein as their songs were the weakest part of the otherwise delightful Gigi and here they don't produce any songs of note. \"I Could Have Danced All Night\" quickly becomes tiresome and \"On the Street Where You Live\" is repetitive not to mention the fact that Harrison can't even sing. I wanted to be humming along with the music and I wanted to have some earworms stuck in my head all day but no, there was no \"So Long, Farewell\" or \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" to keep me happy.\n\nThe costumes are gorgeous and they were the only part of the film deserving of an Academy Award as the inimitable Cecil Beaton earned the Costume Design, Color Award for his efforts. The gowns that Hepburn gets to wear only make her look beautiful, if that were possible, and the entire party at the racecourse are wearing gorgeous costumes, we get to marvel over them for a few minutes. Even Marry Poppins (1964) wasn't enough to overcome Beaton's exceptional abilities.\n\nWhen considering the 1964 Best Picture race I know it is a controversial opinion that of the films nominated, Becket (1964) was the most deserving of the win. It was the better film released that year and I just don't understand why people love Dr. Strangelove (1964) so much. All four other films nominated are more worthy of your time than this silly piece of piffle that doesn't even manage to be entertaining.",

Audrey Hepburn is most believable when she completes her transformation, because she struggles to maintain a convincing cockney accent, often sounding like a cartoon character on vacation in London, but she commits herself to the premise, and both her remarkable beauty and emotional range is on full display. But for me, Rex Harrison is the one who steals the show. I've always been a fan of the charismatic, witty jerk in the world of cinema, and in Henry Higgins, Rex gives us one of the finest. I laughed almost every time he spoke, especially when he's spouting upper-class insults and despairing of our heroines struggles to enunciate. He's an insufferably condescending snob, but his scathing delivery and top-notch timing makes every second he spends on screen a riot. The 3rd act feels like the longest, since we must have the inevitable comedown which plagues most movies in which the leads fall in love. But when the film is good, it's great, and when it's great, it's incredible. A treat for the eyes, the ears and the heart, My Fair Lady might have its missteps, but every foot it puts right will fill you with joy.",

            "content": "I love the music in My Fair Lady.  While I've only seen the movie a few times, I could sing most of the songs word for word because I enjoy listening to them again and again.  The musical is a fun interpretation Pygmalion, with gorgeous visuals including some of the best costumes I've ever seen.  One of the things I quite like is how they show the tedious repetition it takes to train Eliza's voice.  The shocking immediacy of her transformation feels a little too convenient, but it is a classic trope for musicals where something happens all at once in order to coincide with a musical number.  Perhaps the most unusual thing, watching this movie as an adult, is the relationship between Eliza and Professor Higgins.  It's blatantly clear, now that I'm old enough to understand, that Higgins is not interested in her romantically or sexually.  Surprisingly, she seems to indicate that her feelings aren't really romantic or sexual either.  Yet somehow they have this strange bond where they want to be with one another.  In a way, it feels like a hostage who is suffering from the Stockholm Syndrome.  Their relationship is so fascinating that I desperately wish the movie continued so I could see how things look after the bet and their argument has been resolved.\n\nAudrey Hepburn was a controversial casting at the time, particularly because the role was made famous by Julie Andrews on stage, and it seems even more egregious because the songs were not in Hepburn's range so she was dubbed.  But I think her performance is not bad, although her whining and crying when the Professor basically tortures her is kind of painful to the ears.  Rex Harrison is perfect as the emotionless, uncaring, and rude Professor Higgins.  I can't ask for more from that role.  The other actors were all fine, but there is one other character I have to discuss and that is Alfred Doolittle (Eliza's father.)  While Stanley Holloway does a fine job with the character, this is where the movie should have been cut.  His storyline is so needless in the film, and feels like pointless fluff that works in a stage play, but should be excised when adapted.  There's really no reason this film should be almost 3 hours long with an intermission, because the primary story is so simple and could be resolved in a reasonable amount of time.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy singing \"Get Me To The Church On Time\" as much as the other songs, but nowadays that would be a deleted scene on the Blu-Ray.  I like My Fair Lady, and I'm sure I'll watch it again some time, but I think there are places it could be improved and I certainly don't see it as the best picture of 1964.",

            "content": "This film isn't as mean as its concept may make it out to be, this film always seemed to be on at Christmas time whilst I was growing up and while I watched it with my family a number of times I never really saw the whole thing. You read about its concept and it does sound frightfully mean, like Henry Higgins forced Eliza to act differently, when indeed the opposite is true.  He does randomly say that he could change her in 6 months and while at that point it did seem rather odd to say that, it was an offhand remark as he wasn't even serious about it. However, it is Eliza that actually confronts Henry and takes him up on his offer, and while she doesn't really agree to what Higgins has offered, with Mrs. Pearce taking her up the stairs, she could have left any time she wanted to, as Higgins constantly reminds her. \n\nI also find the character of Henry Higgins to not be a misogynist but that of a misanthrope, I thought this after the film but reading someone else's review that agreed with this sentiment, it is nice to know that I'm not alone. True, he might seem cruel to Eliza the most but that is just because he is spending most of his time with her, as the film's concept clearly suggests. His dialogue, while being hugely memorable, is also self parody, he talks about how a woman should act but everything he sings about is everything he has done, he says that if he would be with a woman he would end up being selfish and tyrannical but that is what he is anyway. He has a song about being nice but even that isn't what one might associate with being nice. At one point Eliza thinks he is about to hit her but I didn't see it that way; he just very abruptly took the ring back. I did find myself agreeing with his sentiments about staying alone though, not for the reasons about the women but just to be alone and philosophise. In Eliza's song about Henry, even though it is all in her head, I did find it playful the way Henry reacted to being shot and it is all in good fun. He even says at one point that he treats everyone the same way, and we see that right from the first song and he even yells for his mother at the end, it's not like his dialogue is about women being in the kitchen or anything! \n\n1964 was certainly a good year for films and while the competition certainly was high; this does have the feel of a big Oscar winner. I really enjoyed the acting in this film, Rex Harrison, who could probably do this in his sleep at this point, was a great lead and did an excellent job and he really did carry things well, he had a great introduction and I found him quite funny as well and it is surprising to see that he didn't win the BAFTA. His first song is a perfect introduction to his character even if it might seem mean for him to do what he does. Audrey Hepburn was fantastic and as cute as ever, but with the fact that she was unfairly judged because she wasn't Andrews as well as the fact that she was dubbed, those are the reasons I think she was ignored for an Oscar. I think they made the right choice with her though, besides being an excellent actress anyway, my younger sister saw a really nice black and white picture of Hepburn looking up to her right and smiling in the scene where she meets Higgins for the first time and she said that it looked like Mary Poppins, so Hepburn seems like the best choice possible. Before she spoke what I thought she was going to say when she was knocked over was, 'look what you gone and did'. I really liked her when she was the flowergirl and it's crazy to think that nobody would marry her! She's adorable.  Stanley Holloway was a great addition and I really liked his songs, even if they did go on a bit, his character might have been a bit mean, considering what he did with \u00a35, but he was great and I'm glad he came back later in the film. His voice seemingly changed a little when he met Higgins but this film shows how his life has been 'ruined' by meeting Higgins and I don't think his storyline could be called misogynistic when he wants to get married. Also, for his first song I expected to hear the line, 'with a bit of luck, get drunk', that song has its clear end but does keep on going a little bit, which is nice but very clear in the soundtrack. When I saw that this film was nominated for Best Supporting Actress I thought it might be for Mona Washbourne because I don't really see what Gladys Cooper did to be considered up for an Oscar, she was good, but an Oscar nomination? It is a bit odd to not see Julie Andrews here though, considering Harrison was in the film and there are a few reasons why she wasn't chosen, like, 'she doesn't have screen presence', really? She was in Mary Poppins that year and she won an Oscar as well, so that's something. But true to form, Harrison won an award for the original and the film and neither of the actresses did. \n\nI really was drawn into this world very quickly and the film did make me smile; I was tapping my feet to the songs and they were very memorable, even if one of them, when they come home from the first big event, did seem to not really be about anything at all. They were just singing about how much of a great job they did and that was it. Which, in that song, I find it hard to believe that Pickering ignored her, as Eliza said, he was nice to her and indeed he was, he was nice throughout the entire film but just for that song he ignores her and looks like he will interact with her only to not. The first song was odd though, the rhythm of it seemed a little off with the musical accompaniment, I do like the song but I still noticed that. While the film looks beautiful and is a very excellent production, I could tell it was a set; very early on whilst everyone is out in the town all the voices had an echo and the cinematography seemed to be very claustrophobic but that was done to show no sky because when we are shown a sky, it doesn't even look like it existed. And there were some odd things, like, sometimes during songs, at the end, character's mouths didn't seem to move and when characters say, 'ho ho ho', it was so obvious their mouths were going, 'ha ha ha'. I didn't really understand why all those character froze at the start and that would be annoying if you were holding something over your head but then it just goes on, I thought there would at least be a musical number. There was also some weird editing in the first scene, Eliza talks and it cuts really quite fast after she spoke. Or how all the megaphones turn off when one of Higgins' songs has finished or how he can hear Eliza screaming about the bath when the door is closed but then opens it and closes it and he can't hear it anymore. And if the people on the phone weren't already suspicious, the line, 'what she does here is our affairs' doesn't sound much better.\n\nI thought the dubbing was okay, besides what I already mentioned it isn't really that noticeable and apparently they were going to dub Harrison as well! At one point nearing the end when she got angry she sounded like her old self for just one word and I wondered if that was going to play out in the storyline but it didn't and later on when she is singing with Freddie it happens again. And when she goes back to her old place I thought she would join in with the loverly song. \n\nIt was funny how they sing right at the middle of the night when Eliza gets things right for the first time, they were singing loudly at 3am in the morning. True, the transformation of her dialect happened a tad too quickly because of course she is told something genuinely nice by Higgins but that always seems to happen in any spoof of this but just because she can say a few sentences doesn't really mean she learned a whole new way of talking. I think more time should have been devoted to when Higgins realizes he finally likes her because it happened a bit too quickly. They say at one point after the racetrack scene that she wasn't ready for the next ballroom event but they skimmed over that part quite quickly and Eliza didn't have to learn how to walk properly, she already could. I thought something would go wrong there when that were person looked like they were going to figure out what was going on and Henry's look on his face looked like he didn't understand what was going on and was about to let it happen but he saved it quite nicely.\n\nI know Higgins seemed to only care about winning the bet but he seemed to forget about his offer of finding her a job but it makes sense that he didn't understand why she was upset. It makes sense for the story as to why everyone just seemingly forgot about her, as the bet was won, but it did feel a little odd. I guess the film does give of a theme of being happy with yourself and I guess it is kind of mean to change Eliza like that, regardless if you were to forget about them or not. Still, if you want to think strictly logical about this, it's not like she was being mistreated or anything, as Higgins says, nobody was mean to her and she could have left whenever she wanted, she had everything paid for and was taken to places she never could have dreamed of. It was weird to hear the line about Higgins putting himself through all that work when Eliza was there in that room doing all the alphabet work. I thought she would use the vowels in her song because she began with making the sound of a vowel and I thought that Higgins would see her singing beautifully but that didn't happen. \n\nThe part at the racetrack was pretty funny, the part where they all slowly move their binoculars up and then down was oddly amusing and Eliza spoke about much more than the weather and how someone was. I think we all knew she was going to lose it, but it was funny to see someone faint from that. He talks about the way she speaks as; 'new small talk' but later on Higgins said 'bolted' and I thought that was pretty funny.\n\nI thought Freddie's character was quite pointless, he makes sense for the story but gets forgotten about quickly, he also slowed the film down when he got his song at around and 1hr and 40, did he really wait outside the house for that long? I also thought Higgins would call Eliza a fair lady at one point but just calls her attractive, which is still nice. \n\nThere was a point whilst watching this that I had to get something but I really didn't want to. I was so engaged in what I was watching that I didn't want to leave, and I found it funny how I quoted one of Higgins' lines and then proceeded to say something that Eliza would say and I found that rather funny. I questioned why this film was nearly 3 hours before I watched it just because it seemed strange to see this film be so long but after watching it, it made sense. This is a great mounted production and it really holds up, it is an excellent engaging film and you go on a grand journey. I thought it was going to have a different kind of ending but then it all works itself out, even if that person coming back seemed to happen fast. I also hope that Harrison said that Hepburn was his favourite after they performed the stage show a second time or else that'd have been awkward and it was good he congratulated Andrews as well that night. While awarding 'Dr. Strangelove' would have been the daring choice and the choice I would have personally gone with just because of how much I adore that film, I mean, even seeing Sellers on screen for the part where they announce the actors really sold how excellent that performance was. It isn't hard to see why they chose this and I love the film too, and, hey, it's twice the length of 'Dr. Strangelove' as well, so it has the 'epic' factor going for it too. With excellent acting, storytelling, musical numbers and overall effort, it isn't hard to see why this remains a classic and is an excellent adaptation. And I really love the posters for this film, the pink one especially. How rare is it to see the stage play and the film of a stage play both be held up in such high regard? Although the consensus for this film really does not say that much about the film at all, 'My Fair Lady', is an absolute classic and an absolute wonder of a film.",

            "content": "Lerner and Loewe tried to turn Gigi into a proper Frenchwoman, and now they're trying to turn some Cockney gal into a proper Englishwoman, so they seemed to be as into formal gals as George Cukor was into glamorous gals, though not exactly to be attracted to. Cukor saw the birth of a star, and now he's back with \"A Proper Lady is Born\", and if that's not good enough news for you, well, it's even longer! Seriously though, sorry, Cukor, but in 1964, Billy Taylor beat you to an adaptation of \"My Fair Lady\", although your interpretation quickly drove the \"My Fair Lady Loves Jazz\" album into obscurity. I better remember this film if it's going to take three hours to try and burn into my brain, so it's a good thing that these songs are so catchy, because this isn't exactly a complex epic. Well, this story at least feels kind of thin, because it's so much less convoluted than this film's origin as an adaptation of a musical that is an adaptation of a film that is an adaptation of a play, although we can at least take comfort in the fact that this chain of adaptations is still less confusing than the original property's title, \"Pygmalion\". For the record, that title is referring to the Pygmalion effect, which states that the greater the challenge, the greater the reactive performance is, although I may only know that because my watching this film and, well, looking into jazz deeply enough to know about Billy Taylor's \"A Proper Lady is Born\" reflect that I have a lot of time on my hands to look up inconsequential stuff. So yeah, \"A Proper Lady is Born\" is plenty decent and all, but it's no more compelling than \"A Star is Born\", even in concept.\r\n\r\nThe film does so many things well, to where it might have achieved the reward value of such epic musicals of its time as \"The Sound of Music\", or \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" (Forget \"West Side Story\"! I just had to get that out), or of the delightful \"Gigi\", but what challenges it right away is the natural shortcomings to its simple premise of good-hearted street trash receiving an education on formality for the potential of a more respectable, better life, because as interesting as this story is, it's thin, like certain areas of the characterization which needs to carry plenty of depth to make up for the lack of depth to make up for the lack of depth to the plot. Well, the leading Eliza Doolittle character is very layered, albeit not entirely convincingly, but certain more so than her peers, particularly Doolittle's random romantic admirer, and the thin Henry Higgins character whose background is slim, and whose gradual exposition comes much too late to feel the humanity within the often, maybe mostly unlikable role, which still isn't too much more obnoxious than the extremes in either grating informality and pompous class which exacerbate subtlety issues. Frankly, I don't know how much subtlety there is at any point in this melodrama, as its plot is driven by histrionics, and its script is heavy-handed, particularly with fluffier aspects of humor and lively set piece drawing which have become dated and just had to have always been some prominent degree of cheesy. I suppose there's no way around some prominent degree of cheese if this film is going to be celebratory of musical theatrics, forcing in more than a few numbers which are plenty entertaining, but not always, for there are some lyrical shortcomings, formulaic touches and draggings in a few numbers which remind you of just how expendable the musical aspects of the film are. Honestly, I'll take them, for their liveliness does a better job of coloring up the storytelling than the excess narrative material, because with all of my going on about how inconsequential this story concept kind of is, the final product still flirts with a whopping runtime of three hours which is simply not reasonable, reached at a brisk directorial pace, and with script that goes aimlessly bloated. The film kicks off with a hook, and it's not long before momentum settles too much for the final product to transcend underwhelmingness, because as fun and aesthetically competent as this epic of a glamorous musical is, it's too thin, too unsubtle and, of course, too blasted long to truly reward. Nevertheless, the final product entertains thoroughly enough to hold one's patience, and prove aesthetically solid.\r\n\r\nAs celebratory of musical style as this film is, its visual style is one of the most outstanding aspects, for Harry Stradling's Oscar-winning cinematography plays with lighting in a manner which ranges from handsomely heavy in its coloration, to crisply dreamy, and with a scope which all but justifies the length of an epic through a fine balance between sweep and intimacy which immerses you into Edwardian England, with a great deal of help from Gene Allen's, Cecil Beaton's and Malcolm C. Bert's outstandingly diverse and, with the help of Beaton's and Michael Neuwirth's costume designs, lavish art direction. The film looks plenty grand, and, of course, it also sounds plenty grand, with Andr\u00e9 Previn delivering on a formulaic, but either sweeping or tender, and consistently lovely score which keeps musical liveliness up in between the musical numbers by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, more than a few of which are simply forced and exhaustingly overlong, with a couple feeling under-inspired and conventional, only to be far outweighed by thoroughly catchy, near-symphonically well-orchestrated tunes whose being backed by often simple, but always somewhat energetic choreography make some genuinely memorable and very fun cinematic theatrics. The film is a beauty, both visually and musically, and I wish the substance was up to par with the style, although the style is still so solid that it carries the film a fair distance, at least before it loses a good bit of momentum that George Cukor never really allows to fall all that much. As director, Cukor can get overstylized, and rarely puts all that much of an effort into making up for scripting shortcomings through thoughtful storytelling, but it's as if Cukor has a better understanding of what kind of film this is than Lerner and George Bernard Shaw, as writers, keeping pacing smooth and pacing lively in order to establish an entertainment value and charm which endears throughout this film's challenging course. The onscreen charmers also do a better job with their duties than the writing, which draws thin characters who are hard to buy into and even rather obnoxious, if not unlikable, yet are, in fact, endearing, thanks to the thorough grounded charm of Wilfrid Hyde-White and Rex Harrison, and to the theatrical, if cheesily overdramatic charm of the lovely Audrey Hepburn. The performers entertain and charm about as much as Cukor does, and it helps that Lerner and Shaw are never terribly flat with their writing material for the onscreen and offscreen talents, bloating the film's structure and thinning developmental depth, to where engagement value gradually slips, but keeping consistent with witty dialogue and plenty of amusing comic set pieces which, at the very least, hold the potential to entertain. The film stands to hold more potential in other areas, but when it comes to that potential for fun, it is thoroughly fulfilled by solid style, lively storytelling and colorful performers, who hold your attention, even if they can't firmly secure your investment.\r\n\r\nWhen the rain finally passes over Spain, the natural shortcomings of this thin story go too intensely stressed by thin characterization, obnoxious aspects, serious subtlety issues, cheesy spots, some forced musical numbers, and, of course, an excessive length to transcend underwhelmingness, but your patience ought to be secured firmly enough by beautiful cinematography and art direction, grand score work and musical numbers, lively directorial storytelling, charming performances, and clever, if overblown writing to make George Cukor's \"My Fair Lady\" a fun affair of limited consequence and great excess.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

Very few musicals have impressed me with their ability to establish a setting; the one that is most deserving of praise is The Sound of Music. My Fair Lady is a film that is definitely limited in its scope, utilizing sets rather than locations in order to save money. I completely empathise the film's inability to film in locations and use a large cast as studios wouldn't be too comfortable spending too much of their money on one film. Luckily, My Fair Lady's setting isn't as much of a bothersome as compared to Oliver!, that film featured sets that felt too claustrophobic and lacking in any sense of reality, I was too aware that I was watching something artificial. Overall I was content with what the set designers have done for this film. I do want to mention that the costume designers in this film did a top notch job, especially for Miss Hepburn who looks ravishing in that iconic outfit when she was at the races.\n\nThe most important part of the musical is its songs, as it would be pointless of telling the story in this medium if the only aspect of it that is unique fails to create any sense of effect, if this is so then might as well craft the story into a traditional film. Not all of My Fair Lady's musical numbers work, as some felt a little lacklustre in its execution. The film's songs were able to emphasise the film's themes and flesh out a bit more of character's personalities; some were delivered in a upbeat and optimistic fashion but features lyrics that are quite depressing and pathetic, almost to the point of losing all sympathy towards the character, and I do speak all of this in a positive tone. The most memorable of numbers include \"Wouldn't It Be Lovely\", \"With a Little Bit of Luck\", \"The Rain in Spain\", and of course \"Get Me to the Church on Time\".\n\nMy Fair Lady features wonderful performances from both Audrey Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle and Rex Harrison as Henry Higgins. They both demonstrated great chemistry with one another and able to show the personalities of their characters without ever reaching near to the point of intolerable. It was wonderful to see Hepburn in a role like this, where I get to see a side of her that is not commonly found in her other films; also putting on an accent which I felt was appropriate given the standards of that time. It is too bad that it wasn't Hepburn's voice that I heard singing, instead it was by the wonderful Marni Nixon. She delivered such a powerful presence with her singing, with most moments edging out Harrison's performance. Later on in the film though, we do get to see Hepburn do what she does best, being fabulous. Rex Harrison was an arsehole in this film, and he performed it very well. It reached to a point where I actually felt hatred inside me, but since this is the film's intention, I see this as a favourable aspect in his performance. All in all it was a delight to watch these actors play their colourful roles without any hint of restraint.\n\nMy Fair Lady may not be the most acclaimed musical of all time but it does have its constructive attributes that makes it an important film and something that I would encourage everyone to see.

            "content": "Although musicals aren't easy at please me, due to the amount of Academy Awards given to My Fair Lady, it sounded like it was worth a viewing.\n\nMy Fair Lady isn't exactly my kind of film because it is a music with the premise about essentially an extreme makeover with romantic undertones, and none of those are of any interest to me. I mean, a musical film involving a love story and giving someone an \"extreme makeover\" are all of little interest to me, but the simple fact that My Fair Lady was so critically acclaimed convinced me to keep on watching.\nThe social commentary in My Fair Lady is good. The way that the upper class characters automatically they assume to be superior and feel that they must teach the \"inferior\" to act like them is a theme that reflects mainly into the real world. Although the film is a rather cheesy and glamourous musical which skips over this theme, many of the scenes where it puts comedic emphasis on the nature of Eliza Doolittle in comparison to her upper class surrounders reveal a cultural difference. The entire film is about how society is more likely to expect someone to change than it is to accept who they are, so in its own clever way My Fair Lady is actually a pretty deep film. It just feels rather shallow because it is a corny and cheesy romantic story which is full of glamourous imagery. It embodies the style of classical musicals and therefore its appeal is not as relevant today which meant that I was easily able to pick out a lot of flaws in it. Overall, I enjoyed My Fair Lady. I did not enjoy it for its story which was cheap and unappealing tale despite some of its underlying depth, and I did not find the music to be that catchy either, but it was a good film.\nMy Fair Lady has to battle age as difficultly as a lot of musical films, and considering that this one is a prime example of the cheesy nature of the genre, it is understandable if its appeal would have sunk today. But if you look closely at the film, you can see how it serves as an allegory for society's tendency for wanting to change people against their own better judgement. It asks the question of what education is in comparison simply to glamourisation, as in what is intelligence in comparison to class. The fact that the character Eliza Doolittle was seen as a person who needed to be changed serves as both an example of how someone can seriously change when they set their mind to it, but also the fact that she shouldn't have to simply to fit in with the crowd of upper class snobs who essentially treat her with disrespect simply for being different. I was surprised just how deep My Fair Lady ended up being under the surface, and so it proves to maintain the same meaningful values and virtues that came from its original source material, Pygmalion. Although My Fair Lady is a shallow and glamourised musical, it does have some meaningful subject matter which makes it a worthy viewing.\nAnd in terms of stylishness, My Fair Lady is built on a glamourous production design and costumes which establish the time period of the film very nicely and make it feel genuine. The scenery is also beautiful, and it is captured with very nice cinematography which is smooth and allows the audience to view a lot of the lush design of the film, so the glamourous visuals in My Fair lady are effective as well.\nAnd to match it all is a very talented cast.\nI struggled to notice Audrey Hepburn in her role at first because her voice articulation and appearance is so different to the usual level of sophistication that she brings to films. And she is befitting to the role excellently. As the titular Lady, Audrey Hepburn manages to inject an organic charm into the role which makes her a very sympathetic figure, and although her singing voice had to be dubbed, her lip-syncing is near perfect. Audrey Hepburn is a very charming lead presence in My Fair Lady, and so it is easy for many viewers to find themselves \"accustomed to her face\" as Rex Harrison would sing.\nRex Harrison is also terrific. Singing with an excellent voice, Rex Harrison manages to portray a stereotypical upper-class ponce very well. He has a certain sense of egotism to him which makes him a bit of a stuck up person, but the fact is that it is difficult not to sympathise for him simply because Rex Harrison's natural comedic charisma is infectious. His dedication to his role and to the script is very strong, and he never sinks out of character or stops until the end of his performance which has him carrying it to the end. Rex Harrison is great in My Fair Lady, and the complexity in his chemistry with Audrey Hepburn suggests that the two critically acclaimed actors are learning from each other in the experience of making the film, and it just makes it all the more better.\nStanley Holloway was also great as Alfred P. Doolittle and Gladys Cooper was a nice tough in her supporting role as Mrs. Higgins, so the entire cast in My Fair Lady makes a firm and effective effort.\n\nSo although My Fair Lady has had to battle age and remains an example of Hollywood musicals during the most popular age with all the shallow glitz and glam that made it a popular genre, the story in My Fair Lady is actually fairly meaningful underneath all of its great visual elements and the cast is very dedicated to the piece so it is a mostly entertaining film which does raise some valid points in the minds of viewers who are able to think deeply into what it is saying about society.",

I would have liked to see Julie Andrews in this role on stage, but Audrey Hepburn does a fantastic job. Besides if she did this movie she couldn't play Mary Poppins! (And could we really picture anybody else playing her?) Rex Harrison does a great job as Professor Henry Higgins, hillairously misanthropic. His character would generally be  called a mysgonist, but he's more of a misanthrope as he clearly says \"The question is not weather I treat you rudely, but weather you've ever seen me treat anyone else better.\", and it's true. He's quite often rude to Colnel Pickering and Eliza's father too. The film is quite funny particularly in the scenes of vocal lessons and Eliza swallows a marble. (Higgins:What's the matter? Eliza:I swallowed one! Higgins:Oh it doesn't matter. I have plenty more open your mouth!)The songs (save You Did It perhaps)are wonderful. You Did It is minorly annoying, but I can't take away even half a point from this movie, I love it that much. My Fair Lady is a joyous feel good musical for the whole family.",

            "content": "I wish I could have seen Julie Andrews in action. I much prefer her Eliza Doolittle in the cast recordings of stage musical My Fair Lady over those recordings of not Audrey Hepburn, Eliza Doolittle in the film version, but rather Marni Nixon. This is not uncommon in film versions of musicals, where the actor and the singer are not always the same person. That's fine though, because the songs still tower over everything else. This is in part thanks to composer Frederick Loewe, but also to the performers (who probably agree that they can act better than they sing) and even to the choreographer. The scene of British yuppies watching the horse race made me want to smack sense into the calm manners of each upper-class man. For a length of near three hours, the film plays through quickly. That may be because it is a hoot to watch Eliza Doolittle come of age, watching a horse race while maintaining her upper-class persona and meeting the queen of England.\n\nI may criticize the story itself. I like the realism of how a taste of wealth is difficult for one to abstain from. If any of the Doolittles were already of the high class, an audience would likely see them as greedy bastards. But because the Doolittles are at the bottom of the barrel, the audience may instead see them as humans who are doing what is rational. However, Eliza fails us as a hero by the end of the story. Unlike Pygmalion, the source material for My Fair Lady, Eliza stays with the verbally and emotionally abuse linguistics professor, Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison), even though she beautifully tears him apart and storms off not ten minutes before. The ongoing verbal abuse between Doolittle and Higgins is mighty juicy, even when one thinks they should get along with one another. My Fair Lady won't be a classic in my movie list, but I see myself wanting to watch this more than once.",

The conception of rhetoric and its relationship to identity are thoroughly explored.  By changing Eliza's language does Higgins change who she is?  Is that form of education robbing her of her independence and identity?  Is that even what we mean by \"education?\" Should language be changed to fit societal norms?  The film and play poses these questions and answers very few.\nAudrey Hepburn is delightful as always, and Rex Harrison is the perfect conceited intellectual.  The love plot is charming and made me smile more than once.  The only problem I had with the film's performances is Harrison's singing.  He more spoke his words in rhythm than sang them, but after a while, this delivery grew on me.\n*Spoiler Alert*\nI wish the story ended differently.  There wasn't enough humility on the part of the love-vanquished Professor Higgins, and the final shot of Eliza getting his slippers made me think that neither of these characters learned enough.\nOverall, this film is very good, a fine representation of its source material.",

            "content": "\"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain!\"\r\n\r\nIt has been viewed as one of the greatest musical based on stage musicals of all-time. It delighted audiences 50 years ago and still does today. It won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, beating out Dr. Strangelove, Zorba the Greek, Becket, and Mary Poppins, which is one of my all-time favorite musicals. But is My Fair Lady better than Mary Poppins and deserved to win the Best Picture award? Well, you'll find out at the end of the review.\r\n\r\nAudrey Hepburn plays Eliza Doolittle, a poor flower girl with a cockney accent who's accused by Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) of being a disgrace to society. He tells colleague Colonel Pickering (Wilfred Hyde-White) that he could transform her into a proper lady in six months. Doolittle accepts, and the idea turns into a bet and the training proves harder than Doolittle ever anticipated.\r\n\r\nMy Fair Lady also stars Stanley Holloway as Alfred Doolittle, Eliza's poor and heavily drunken cockney father, Gladys Cooper as Mrs. Higgins, a very wise mother of Henry, and Jeremy Brett plays Freddie, a serviceman who goes gaga after Eliza's looks.\r\n\r\nTo start off, My Fair Lady is an excellent musical. The story about a woman learning to speak proper English might sound a bit disturbing, and sometimes creepy, but the end result is highly entertaining. \r\n\r\nNormally I don't speak highly of the wardrobe department, cause I don't care too much for clothes anyhow, but My Fair Lady's costume designs are some of the best costumes I've seen in a film. Hepburn's fancy dresses, other women's snazzy clothing, the tuxes in Harrison and others, the entire scene at the races was a sight to behold. The costume department also wowed me during the ball sequence. I generally don't go into costumes that much, but with something like My Fair Lady, it's hard to resist.\r\n\r\nNow, the casting. Rex Harrison was fantastic as Professor Higgins. He did the role in the play as well, and he delights in his witty personality and sometimes rude humor. The character is actually a sick, twisted, and sometimes disturbing character, with his attitude towards women and his intentions after his experiment.  But in the hands of Rex Harrison, you kind of like the guy. He's funny, he's witty, and his screen presence was fun. That's probably why he won the Oscar for his role. The other actor who was previously in the play was Stanley Holloway as Eliza's father. Like Harrison, Holloway steals the picture in his scenes, and makes for some entertaining numbers, which I'll get too in a minute. Gladys Cooper was memorable as Higgins' mom, and I also enjoyed Jeremy Brett as Freddy the serviceman. \r\n\r\nBut what about Audrey Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle? Well, that's a tough question, and kind of needs a whole paragraph to talk about her. In the Broadway play, Julie Andrews did the role, but when it came time to the film, the producers wanted a more well-known actress for the part, so Hepburn was cast. But there's one problem: she couldn't sing. While Hepburn recorded some songs during production, in the end, her singing voice was dubbed by Marni Nixon, also known for dubbing Natalie Wood in West Side Story. Because of this, Andrews fans cried foul, and due to this outrage, Hepburn was snubbed from the Academy and the Oscar for Best Actress went to, you guessed it, Julie Andrews for her role in Mary Poppins. Yes, Andrews deserved that award, but Hepburn should have at least gotten a nomination. Yes, I know her singing voice was dubbed, but dubbing doesn't bother me. On the DVD, there's a feature showing the Hepburn recordings of the songs, and she was literally awful. My belief is that is someone can't sing in a musical, they should be dubbed, and Nixon's dubbing was perfect. I actually find Nixon's voice as strong as Andrews's. As for Hepburn as Doolittle, she was great. Her cockney accent was astounding (which is something I can't imagine Julie Andrews doing), and her charms were fantastic. When I think of Hepburn, I think of her in Charade and in this. When I think of Julie Andrews, I think of Mary Poppins and Sound of Music. The case is closed.\r\n\r\nSince My Fair Lady is a musical, you have to talk about the songs, and they were mostly outstanding. Rex Harrison leads the opening number \"Why Can't the English\", and it delivers in the humor and Harrison's presence. The dubbed Hepburn then sings \"Wouldn't it be Loverly\", and it was outstanding. Even when reviewing this, I can't get it out of my head. Harrison then performs \"I'm an Ordinary Man\", and it's memorable for him. Stanley Holloway then performs the very catchy \"With a Little Bit of Luck\", which can relate to just about anybody. Hepburn, who actually sings in the beginning and end of this, performs \"Just You Wait\", and it actually was a song where Hepburn could sing, cause of the accents and all. Dubbed Hepburn then sings \"The Rain in Spain\", and delivers in the vocals, along with the most famous number \"I Could Have Danced All Night.\" A chorus performs \"Poor Professor Higgins\" and \"Ascot Gavotte\", and they were OK. Not great but OK. Jeremy Brett, whose voice was also dubbed, sings \"On the Street Where You Live\", and it's wonderful to hear. Wilfred Hyde-White and Harrison then perform \"You Did It\", and it's definitely the worst song in the film. Hyde-White couldn't sing, and his voice should have been dubbed. Harrison was OK, but the song seemed like filler and should have been cut. Nixon, the dubbed Hepburn, then sings \"Show Me\", and it's fantastic and memorable. Holloway then sings the very memorable and my favorite song from the film \"Get Me to the Church on Time\". Nixon then sings \"Without You\", and wows. And finally, Harrison performs the closing number \"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face\", which closes the film on a high note.\r\n\r\nIs My Fair Lady an essential Best Picture winner? Maybe, but I like Mary Poppins a little more. Is the negative reaction to Hepburn worth it cause her singing voice was dubbed? No, cause Hepburn couldn't sing and the dubbing was necessary. Did Hepburn do the role great? Yes. She was the best thing in it. Is the film worth watching? Well, despite the fact that Mary Poppins is the better film, but by half a point, My Fair Lady is a memorable and outstanding musical, with incredible acting performances, great songs, and stunning costumes. If you watch it just to have a good time, then you'll probably love it as much as I did.",

The chemistry between Hepburn, wonderful as usual, and Harrison who gets to play the character he played so many times on the stage on the screen, is superb. The soundtrack marvellous. Cukor is often underrated as a master of a certain glamorous kind of cinema, but in this film his direction is superb, as he portrays the big lavish halls of formal parties to the decadent and poor streets of London in the most theatrical of ways. The costumes and art directions are splendid, and only occasionally is the pace slowed down by the musical numbers, perhaps too many, but the score is very memorable.",

That doesn't mean that she can't make a bad film on occasion, but her charms do help any movie.\r\n\r\nThis Best Picture Academy Award winner from 1964 is one of the better musicals I've seen, despite the fact that Audrey lip synched all her songs and Rex Harrison does his famous talk-singing.  The reason I like it is because the non musical moments work so well and are highly satisfying.  The film is long, but I'd rather sit through a long good movie than a short bad one any day.\r\n\r\nThe whole cast is good, but again it is Audrey that makes it truly a special film and is one of her most iconic roles.\r\n\r\nBased on the play \"Pygmalion\", the film follows Eliza Doolittle (Hepburn).  She is an uncouthe cockney girl when she meets Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison).  He sees something in her and vows that he can turn her into aproper lady within six months.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/Zeppo1/MyFairLady_zps9580b363.jpg[/IMG]",

He takes Eliza Doolittle (Hepburn) and begins to train her, not as a person but as an experiment. Eliza eventually gets fed up with this treatment but at the same time also wants to become sophisticated. With Harrison's help she does become that person and is no longer a subject to be experimented with. Putting together a good cast, plot, and songs, this film is quite good.",

So here's my review for My Fair Lady.\r\n\r\nPlot: The film starts out introducing Professor Henry Higgins who believes that a person's accent and tone is what determines a person's part in society. When he meets Eliza - a flower seller from the slums who as a strong Cockney accent - he decides to make a project out of her by proving that within 6 months, he can make her speak 'properly' worthy of her passing as a duchess. So Higgins gives Eliza speaking lessons with his new friend Colonel Pickering.\r\n\r\nThis was just a nice movie to me. It's not bad or anything, I mean it has a good story and some likable characters. And while I don't love the entire soundtrack, it does have some songs that are memorable like Wouldn't it be Lovely, With a Little Bit of Luck, and I Could Have Danced All Night, along with some I haven't heard before that I thought were good too such as Show Me, and Get Me to the Church on Time. The characters were also well acted, most notably Audrey Hepburn with how she displayed how much Eliza changes in this movie and Stanley Holloway with being the comedy relief as Alfred. But ultimately, I think the musical itself is just nice. It's not bad or spectacular, but it's more like musicals like White Christmas were they can be enjoyable, but not one of my favorites.\r\n\r\nAnd that's my review for My Fair Lady. It's a nice film that was well done for the most part, but it is not a musical film that I consider to be particularly memorable",

I saw some of the singing performances of Audrey that were dubbed and she is, in fact, sub-par on that point. Would Julie sing better than Audrey? Absolutely. Would she act better than Audrey? I'm not sure she would. This is the first movie I saw with Audrey, and I thought she's a spectacular actress, but I already saw many things with Julie Andrews and, although she's a good actress, I'm not sure the trade-off would be favorable. Past that point, I'm impressed of how much I liked this movie, because musicals usually are boring and extremely cheesy, but this one is very interesting and none of the musical performances were able to annoy me. The plot is interesting, the acting and singing is amazing. I noticed some editing flaws (at least I guess they're flaws, I don't know much about this), but otherwise the movie was perfect and the 3 hours flew by.",

The story based on Shaw's Pygmalion has been transformed with Lerner and Loewe's brilliant score and libretto. A Professor of linguistics has a bet that he can pass off a poor street girl as a society \"Lady\" only to fall in love with her. Directed by brilliant Hollywood director George Cukor, sumptuous Art Direction from Cecil Beaton and music supervised by Andr\u00e9 Previn this is probably the last of the big Musicals (made by Warner Brothers not MGM). The only reason for four and a half stars and not 5  is Audrey Hepburn. She is miscast in this version and unfortunately Julie Andrews who was in the West End and Broadway productions was waived aside in favour of Hepburn who's star was on the ascendent at this time. However this was made the same year as Mary Poppins and Andrews won the Academy Award for that role and Hepburn went away  empty handed.  If you can find it playing on the big screen try to catch it in its 70mm version which is a real treat. The film has recently been restored and the sound and vision is truly stunning.",

For one, it's nearly three hours long, which is about an hour too long.  Second, the early part of the film languishes from Hepburn trying to unconvincingly pull off a dirty, profane woman when the production never \"messes\" her up enough for the character.  Third, the direction by Cukor feels entirely ripped off from the stage instead of giving the production a motion picture feel.  Fourth, and here's the big one, the idea of a man \"creating\" a woman and that woman coming back to him is morally suspect.  Harrison is pompus as Henry Higgins, so much so to make him unlikeable.  Hepburn's Eliza Doolittle is game, but she is hamstrung by a character who doesn't know which way to go.  I expected more from this group.",

My Fairy Lady shows a perfectly delightful tale about one woman's struggle to adapt to a higher society and learn how to speak proper English. The whole farce is truly laughable. And there is a great amount of romance that comes with it. Audrey Hepburn will always be remembered as the clumsy, yet really lovable and pretty flower girl, who is gradually becoming a great lady. The songs are splendid and catchy, just as the style of the characters is indisputable.",

Hearing the same singing voice coming from Natalie Wood and Audrey Hepburn is just weird. That said, My Fair Lady is a classic musical, and it deserves the status. The songs are memorable, the leads are likable, and there's a sense of spectacle to the whole affair that just screams 'Broadway'. I'm always a bit leery of old musicals because of the excessiveness exhibited by many of them. Here, outside of Alfie Dolittle's draggy song-and-dance numbers, there doesn't seem to be a lot of excess material. And Rex Harrison is probably the ONLY actor who can play Henry Higgins and make him come off as lovable, not just a snotty asshole. It's a bit upsetting that Audrey Hepburn's real singing voice isn't on display, but the songs are all so well-dubbed, it's hard to tell unless you know going in. While I'd argue against Oliver and Sound of Music being considered 'classics', My Fair Lady actually does deserve most of the praise heaped upon it.\n\nJust don't watch it in the same block as West Side Story.",
