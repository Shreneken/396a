When a regiment of Mexican soldiers bearing gold intended to pay for new weapons is waylaid by the Rojo brothers, the stranger inserts himself into the middle of the long-simmering battle, selling false information to both sides for his own benefit.",

Clint Eastwood and his presence on the screen coupled with Ennio Morricone's brilliantly beautiful music is classic cinematic perfection. I feel like this had to be one of the most violent movies at the time it came out since Clint Eastwood got beat up and tortured so much in one scene, which takes guts to show in a Hollywood/American culture at a time when movies were supposed to be more pleasant and less risk-taking. This is one of the first westerns I've ever watched and it only got better from here!",

The only real problem is the pacing which is good still but it takes its time with scenes and doesn't really have the epic scale of Leone's later works to justify it sometimes. This could've probably had 5-10 minutes cut off certain scenes. Besides that this is masterfully edited, acted, shot with an incredible music score. This film is full of mood and style. Ramon is an excellent menacing, ruthless and memorable villain. The story very much is very witty and is similar to that of The Sting. Anyone should give this a watch once.",

It averages out to an overall passable but forgettable experience.\n\nBy far the best part of this movie is the music. It's worth watching for the soundtrack alone. The costume and set designs are also really solid. Clint Eastwood's performance is charming and charismatic, making him hard not to root for.\n\nHowever, the audio dubbing is TERRIBLE. Not just the dialogue, but all of the sound effects sound awkward and unrealistic. It's mostly this reason that the film has no sense of immersion. The voice acting is generally stiff as well. On top of that, the stunt acting is mostly mediocre but sometimes laughably bad. Finally, the fact that virtually the entire cast is Italian people in brownface doing awful Mexican accents made this film difficult to watch for me.\n\nAlso, the entire story relies on Clint Eastwood being basically infallible while everyone around him is a complete imbecile. There's no sense of tension; every scene ends with the protagonist either executing a ridiculous plan or just shooting everyone because he's apparently that good of a shot. None of the character motives are ever very clear.\n\nIt's culturally relevant and the music is bomb, but other than that it's objectively just not that good of a movie.",

Easwtood does, of course, play the very sly and laidback man with no name, although his character is referred to briefly as 'Joe'. Some scenes are rather slow paced and thus may put off some but the confrontation/fight scenes are, obviously, the opposite - there's a real frenetic energy which energised me while watching.\n\nI liked that it has a more budget feel to it - that its clearly not a Hollywood film, featuring characters of different ethnicities/nationalities, the visually grainier feel to the shots and so on. Also the very bright red blood used didn't seem esp. realistic but I suppose there is a certain charm to that somehow.\n\nI can understand the appeal of this film, its one of those whereby characters can say more in their moments of silence, via their facial expressions than by dialogue, so suffice to say I'd certainly recommend this film to fans of Westerns, more specifically Spaghetti Westerns (if you haven't seen it already).",

The good?  It's the debut of Clint Eastwood's \u2018Man With No Name' character, a steely-eyed killer with a clear moral compass.  The cinematography is generally excellent, giving a true feel for what it must have felt like in the Old West. As well, Ennio Morricone's score is catchy and effective.  The bad?  The dubbing is absolutely horrendous, and it's not helped at all by the wooden acting and corny dialogue.  The ugly?  The plot is often impossible to follow, implausible and ludicrous throughout.

That said, that is not down-grading A Fistful of Dollars in any way, it is still a truly great film. As with all Leone's it is incredibly well made, the scenery is epic and looks gorgeous and the extreme close ups really helps to enhance the unrelenting violence. Ennio Morricone's score is wonderful with its minimalist style really fitting with the movie. The story is both elegiac which helps to give that feel of mystery to the Man with No Name's character and thrilling with the violence and the camera work. Leone's direction is as ever superb, as is the acting. Clint Eastwood became an international superstar and you can see why, he oozes charisma and his idea to make The Man with No Name mysterious with minimal dialogue proved to be a great one. Of the supporting cast, Gian Maria Volonte is especially impressive, as Ramon he snarls very convincingly. All in all, a great film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

He gets great support from the rest of the cast, particularly Gian Maria Volonte as the villainous Ramon.  Behind the camera, Sergio Leone crafted a western that reset the genre, complete with anti-heroes and shady values (Eastwood's Joe is not exactly a pure hero).  It is matched by a nicely twisty plot along with some epic shootouts.  All in all, a classic western through and through, and Eastwood & Leone were just getting started.",

Would there be any point today to assess Michael Jordan's performance with the Bulls in the 1990s, since it is now basically unanimously agreed he is the best to ever play the game?\n\nWhile Eastwood would likely be the MVP for most here, I'm giving it to Ennio Morricone whose score was instantly recognizable and somehow created a nostalgic feeling in me while watching a movie I had never seen.",

That got me stoked to catch up on what I always hear celebrated as a classic, but good lord, Fistful of Dollars is tough to watch. It has its moments of humor and Clint Eastwood cool, but it has a paper-thin story and just way too much absurdity for me to overcome suspension of disbelief. There's very little tension or suspense, just ridiculous and repetitive montages of bloodless shootings with guys grabbing their backs and falling over. For the most part it's nicely shot, but the day-for-night  scenes and poor dubbing just makes it all seem farcical. It's weirdly paced and drags in a way that the significantly longer Once Upon A Time... does not.  In the latter, character and plot are slowly revealed in a way that keeps one invested. Here we have a nameless dude with a barely-hinted-at traumatic back story carrying the narrative weight, and I just didn't care. The Morricone score is iconic and might account for the indelible imprint this film has made on the culture, but it just feels like this is a case where the reputation far exceeds the reality. I kept looking for a way to watch it at 1.5x speed but I guess that's not an option on Amazon. I toughed it out till the end, hoping for redemption, but it just got stupider and stupider. Was this intended as a satire? It's so over the top and illogical that's the only reading that makes sense, but I think people do really take this seriously.

            "content": "An unnamed stranger (Clint Eastwood) arrives at the little town of San Miguel, on the Mexico\u2013United States border. Silvanito, the town's innkeeper, tells the Stranger about a feud between two smuggler families vying to gain control of the town: the Rojo brothers, Don Miguel, Esteban and Ram\u00f3n (Gian Maria Volont\u00e9) and that of the town sheriff, John Baxter (Wolfgang Lukschy), his matriarchal wife Consuelo and their son Antonio. The Stranger decides to play each family against the other in order to make money, and proves his speed and accuracy with his gun to both sides by shooting with ease the four men who insulted him as he entered town. The Stranger seizes his opportunity when he sees the Rojos massacre a detachment of Mexican soldiers who were escorting a chest of gold that they had planned to exchange for a shipment of new rifles. He takes two of the dead bodies to a nearby cemetery and sells information to both sides, saying that two Mexican soldiers survived the attack. Both sides race to the cemetery; the Baxters to get the \"survivors\" to testify against the Rojos, and the Rojos to silence them. The factions engage in a gunfight, with Ram\u00f3n managing to \"kill\" the \"survivors\" and Esteban capturing Antonio Baxter. While the Rojos and the Baxters are fighting, the Stranger searches the Rojo hacienda for the gold. While he is searching he accidentally knocks out a woman, Marisol. He takes her to the Baxters, who, in turn, arrange to return her to the Rojos in exchange for Antonio. During the exchange, Marisol's son, Jes\u00fas, runs towards her, followed by her husband, Julio. While the family embraces, Ram\u00f3n orders one of his men, Rubio, to kill her husband as he has already told him to leave town. Silvanito attempts to protect the family with a shotgun with the Stranger backing him up. Neither Ram\u00f3n nor any of his men attempt to challenge the Stranger, knowing that he is too fast on the draw...\n\nPromoting \"A Fistful of Dollars\" was difficult, because no major distributor wanted to take a chance on a faux-Western and an unknown director. The film ended up being released in Italy on 12 September 1964, which was typically the worst month for sales. The film was shunned by the Italian critics, who gave it extremely negative reviews. Some American critics felt differently from their Italian counterparts, with Variety praising it as having \"a James Bondian vigor and tongue-in-cheek approach that was sure to capture both sophisticates and average cinema patrons\". Despite the negative reviews from Italian critics, at a grassroots level, its popularity spread and over the film's theatrical release, it grossed $4 million in Italy, about three billion lire, more than any other Italian film up to that point. The release of the film was delayed in the United States, because distributors feared being sued by Kurosawa. As a result, it was not shown in American cinemas until January 1967. Upon the film's American release in 1967, both Philip French and Bosley Crowther were unimpressed with the film itself. Critic Philip French of The Observer stated: \"The calculated sadism of the film would be offensive were it not for the neutralising laughter aroused by the ludicrousness of the whole exercise. If one didn't know the actual provenance of the film, one would guess that it was a private movie made by a group of rich European Western fans at a dude ranch... A Fistful of Dollars looks awful, has a flat dead soundtrack, and is totally devoid of human feeling.\" Bosley Crowther of The New York Times treated the film not as pastiche, but as camp-parody, stating that nearly every Western cliche could be found in this \"egregiously synthetic but engrossingly morbid, violent film\". He went on to patronize Eastwood's performance, stating: \"He is simply another fabrication of a personality, half cowboy and half gangster, going through the ritualistic postures and exercises of each... He is a morbid, amusing, campy fraud\".\n\nThis classic Sergio Leone 1964 Spaghetti Western has all the trademarks from the director that started a whole new look and feel of the western genre. The film, an international co-production between Italy, West Germany, and Spain, was filmed on a low budget (reported to be $200,000), and Eastwood was paid $15,000 for his role. Released in Italy in 1964 and then in the United States in 1967, it initiated the popularity of the Spaghetti Western genre. It was followed by For a \"Few Dollars More\" and \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", also starring Eastwood. Collectively, the films are known as the \"Dollars Trilogy\", or the \"Man with No Name Trilogy\". All three films were later released in sequence in the United States in 1967, catapulting Eastwood into stardom. The film has been identified as an unofficial remake of the Akira Kurosawa film Yojimbo (1961), which resulted in a successful lawsuit by Toho, Yojimbo's production company. \"A Fistful of Dollars\" was at first intended by Leone to reinvent the western genre in Italy. In his opinion, the American westerns of the mid- to late-1950s had become stagnant, overly preachy and not believable. Despite the fact that even Hollywood began to gear down production of such films, Leone knew that there was still a significant market in Europe for westerns. He observed that Italian audiences laughed at the stock conventions of both American westerns and the pastiche work of Italian directors working behind pseudonyms. His approach was to take the grammar of Italian film and to transpose it into a western setting. Clint Eastwood was instrumental in creating the Man with No Name's distinctive visual style as well. And Clint Eastwood truly personify the character with hardly any dialogue (which was Eastwood\u00b4s idea to cut down the dialogue) and I love the closeup structure in the film and the rotoscope title design. And adding to that we get beautiful visuals, great action and stand offs and proper western atmosphere. And Ennio Morricone\u00b4s soundtrack really sets the bar for how a western should sound like. \n\nTrivia: Clint Eastwood's trademark squint was caused by the combination of the sun and high-wattage arc lamps on the set. This has been described as the first \"spaghetti western\", but when this movie was made, there had already been about twenty-five such westerns produced in Italy. This was, however, the first to receive a major international release.",

            "content": "The world's introduction to Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone!\n\nDirector Sergio Leone splashes into the dirty desert world of Westerns with A Fistful of Dollars (1964). \n\nLeone clearly had a lower budget as the whole film takes place on one big town set alongside the surrounding mountains. The props look cheaper and the music repeats the theme a lot. The main theme is cool with a distinctive whistle whenever Clint Eastwood enters a scene. These are not complaints because you get to focus in on the action and dialogue instead of the background.  Leone makes the most of his little set by defining the Western film genre forevermore!\n\nUnfortunately, the dubbing is bad for certain characters. There is an ungodly annoying boy whose dubber is too old and too obnoxious to have gotten the part, but I ignore him. Hearing Eastwood's natural voice is nice at least. The dubbing is the only real issue I have with A Fistful of Dollars and the delivery is still wonderful for a majority of the cast.\n\nLeone's direction is killer from the get go as he introduces Eastwood with a legendary close-up of his face as Clint tilts his hat up to reveal his deadshot eyes. Leone captures a sense of dread in town with numerous warnings of death in this tale of gaining wealth, stealing money, saving families, rescuing women, and liberating a town. It's all classic hero tropes directed with Leone's lush style of gritty realism and sweat beaten brows.\n\nNotably, A Fistful of Dollars was the first time most people saw Clint Eastwood act. He enters the Western genre young, handsome, and earnest. His acting is already iconic and mature here. Eastwood uses his intense piercing eyes to glare at his enemies, observe deadly situations, and build tension during a gun duel. He speaks with his unique gravel like voice out of the corner of his mouth for a cool and masculine effect. Eastwood makes you believe his nameless hero is an untouchable gunfighter from the first draw. Clint Eastwood is thoughtful, masculine, heroic, kindly, and cool as he defines the quiet Western hero from this point on within A Fistful of Dollars.\n\nI must mention how cool his outfit is in A Fistful of Dollars. Clint Eastwood dons a cowboy hat, blue collared shirt, black jeans, wool jacket, and a killer poncho for the total Western hero fashion guide. All this complete with cowboy boots and spurs alongside Eastwood's gun holster and pistol. He looks cooler than literally any other Western hero as far as I'm concerned.\n\nMarianne Koch is pretty as Marisol, a captive woman stolen from her husband and son. She doesn't do much, but when she looks at the screen or Eastwood, she entrances you immediately. You feel so sorry for her character just by a few looks of her sad eyes. Similarly, you feel awful for the matriarch of the Baxter family Consuelo Baxter, played by the mysterious and lovely Margarita Lozano.\n\nFurthermore, Jose Calvo is awesome as the middle aged bar owner that befriends Clint. He is informative, funny, sweet, and cool as he helps Eastwood defend his home. Any time he is on screen, you are drawn to his warm character Silvanito. Likewise, I love the elderly undertaker Piripero, played by the giddy and delightful Joseph Egger, that also befriends Clint's nameless wanderer. They are the two best characters besides Clint's protagonist.\n\nGian Maria Volonte is outstanding as the cruel and devious Ramon Rojo. His villainous charisma is iconic as he kidnaps Marisol, murders dozens of men, and mercilessly beats on Clint Eastwood. You revel in the moment Clint bests him in their final quick draw duel. Leone directs their last encounter so perfectly. Volonte's shocked face seeing Clint alive, Clint appearing out of the smoke, Clint's metal plate trick, Clint's rapid fire pistol draw, and the pistol versus rifle debate. Leone was a master of directing and the last 15 minutes of A Fistful of Dollars is as genius as any sequence in any Western.",

I'm not exaggerating or anything; but A Fistful of Dollars really has some of the most inventive, and some of the coolest, camerawork and editing scenes I've seen in a Western film.\n\nI haven't seen Kurosawa's Yojimbo yet; but I really liked the story of this film. It's a story full of surprises, and twist and turns that kept me quite engaged and engrossed most of the time. While the movie has its slow parts, and the plot doesn't evolve very smoothly; it gets messy and muddled halfway through, A Fistful of Dollars's story never loses its track. The movie also feels somewhat heavy-handed at times, largely because the dialogue gets clumsy and overly expository at moments.\n\nI could have never imagined any actor who can be perfectly fit for this role as Clint Eastwood. He is as charismatic, bad-ass and tough as ever as the central character, Joe, and this was quite important, since this movie has this kind of story that focuses primarily on one protagonist (this is my favorite kind, btw).\n\nOverall, Per un pugno di dollari is yet another great Leone Western that makes me excited to keep exploring his small but very solid filmography.\n\n(8/10)",

The characters are well written and well acted and are also really good protagonists and antagonists. The action is amazing from the guns to the angles. The music is also so amazing conducted by Ennio Morricone. Over all I give it a 8/10",

I feel that this is wrong as A Fistful actually contains a far more menacing performance by the brilliant Gian Marie Volonte as Rojos Ramos than El Indio which he portrayed in the 2nd film. It\u00e2(TM)s a strange travesty as the character of the middle brother was played by a sensual ease by the charismatic actor. Even the scene of his introduction where he mercifully guns down the soldier battalion is shocking. What a character- an equal of Eastwood's Joe. Any other actor perhaps would have faltered. The film also contains the shocking gunning own of the Baxter's which is quite visceral. A fistful of Dollars is taunt and has a great flow. I totally get the appeal of the 2nd and 3rd film in the series(especially when you count the presence of Van Cleef and Wallach) but this film is unjustly overlooked. What a great film and what an introduction of the iconic cool The Man with No Name.(Masterpiece in my opinion).",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood was not director Sergio Leone's first choice for the 'Man with No Name' role, but he's excellent, and a huge part of why this film is successful.  He has the look of a rattlesnake in Leone's tight shots, exudes confidence and is tough, and yet he's also wryly playful.  His best lines occur early on, when he calls out four men for trying to intimidate him by shooting at his mule when he rode into town.  He says, \"I don't think it's nice, you laughin'. You see, my mule don't like people laughing. He gets the crazy idea you're laughin' at him. Now if you apologize, like I know you're going to, I might convince him that you really didn't mean it.\"  It's easy to see why this film and the rest of the Spaghetti Western films which shortly followed established Eastwood as a star.  His poncho and thin black cigars are also iconic.\n\nLeone's direction is also strong.  He creates a gritty, dark mood in this film, combines those tight shots on his actors with wide panoramas, and makes great use Ennio Morricone's music.  The film was shot in Spain and has some gorgeous shots early on, but I would have loved to have seen more of them.  The dialogue was clearly dubbed in afterwards, and except for Eastwood, is sometimes hard to understand.  Jos\u00e9 Calvo is good as the innkeeper who befriends Eastwood, but John Wells (Gian Maria Volont\u00e8) as the main villain is just average.  I was not happy that Leone had pirated Kurosawa's film Yojimbo (1961) to make this one, but tried to keep it out of my mind.  It's an entertaining movie, the birth of a great collaboration between Eastwood and Leone, and seems to have been influential to the entire genre, and for all that it's worth watching.",

As much as simple the plot goes, the weaving of the whole structure goes dull in its first act, as it grows obvious. It is rich on technical aspects like sound effects, background score and editing. Sergio Leone is no short on execution and has probably improved on his skills as it keeps the audience engaged and doesn't unnecessarily chews off the character's perspective. Clint Eastwood holds on to its role and delivers the expectations and doesn't require any support at all. There are few action packed sequences and whistle-blowing dialogues that can only come out of a fanboy's perspective and this is the key that makes the feature stand alone in its franchise. The choreography too has improved a lot and so has the meddling of the emotions among the characters that is done well within shorter runtime of almost 100 minutes that helps factor in on its favor. Firstful Of Dollars is more than a handful and even though its reach for something more colossal that its potential fails in here, it still grasps a whole lot of popcorn fun in here.",

The traditional \"western movie soundtrack\" style originated from Ennio Morricone's beautiful and haunting work, the \"silent bounty hunter\" type character that is so prevalent in westerns originated from The Man With No Name, who speaks with his guns instead of his hands. This movie has no fluff. Everything is straight to the point, and the action is fast paced, but the fight scenes are long. Nothing feels out of place, with the exception of a few dubbed over voices for characters portrayed by non English speakers, but that goes to show that a multi-lingual cast can still play cohesively in a movie when it is put together by a master like Leone.\nThis is a movie that should not be missed by ANYONE.",

You can see why Kurosawa and co. successfully sued to get a part of the profits - Clint Eastwood effectively takes over the Toshiro Mifune character, albeit transplanted to the West (although Yojimbo clearly borrowed from the western genre too).  Of course, Eastwood brings his own unique iconography (lots of squinting) to the part just as Mifune had earlier (lots of scratching) - both were larger than life (and went on to play the same character in one or more sequels).  Leone uses the widescreen gloriously and the Spanish terrain is a good stand in for the Mexican setting.  The plot famously sees the Man/Samurai arriving in a lawless town and playing two rival gangs off against each other until both are dead and he can ride away with all of their money.  He's tough, cool, and in some ways more moral than the rest.  The bad get what's coming to them and the innocent and vulnerable are set free, all to the magnificent sounds of Ennio Morricone.  I still can't remember if I'd seen this before (or one or both of its sequels), so there is something about the blur of characters here (aside from Eastwood, of course, and Gian Maria Volont\u00e8 as Ramon) that makes it difficult to stick.  For my money, I prefer Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) or Akira Kurosawa, for that matter.  Still, you can't deny the trailblazing effect of Leone's trilogy and Eastwood's dogged longevity.",

It feels extremely long at only 100 minutes (which is obviously inherent to the genre), with several superfluous sequences involving characters rambling off unnecessary exposition and a tedious back-and-forth narrative that takes far too long to corral the two competing families into the climactic showdown, dragging out the proceedings in a way that never feels compelling.

It has the trademarks and quirks of a Bond movie, but has it's own uniqueness to it. Sergio has fun modifying the Hollywood clich\u00e9s known during the movies contemporary time. You think something's going happen, it does, but in a completely different manor than you expected. The plot is as exciting as Ennio Morricone's score. Eastwood's subtle, Max Rockatansky/James Bond/Indiana Jones performance is iconic, yet has it's own quirkiness to it.

Eastwood is not the kind of actor that smells like a SAG meeting or a thespian conference.  Rather, he possesses enviable tenacity, scowling as if he'd prefer to be angrily smoking on a dimly-lit street corner in Detroit, or somewhere dirtier.  \n\tWhen he makes his first appearance in \"A Fistful of Dollars,\" I felt an uncontrollable urge to loudly ask \"who is that?\", despite being completely aware of his momentous career.  Wearing a weathered cowboy hat, an armor-like poncho, a ten-day beard, and a hardened grimace, he looks considerably iconic.  Eastwood remains nameless for the remainder of the film (most movie buffs refer to him simply as \"The Man With No Name\"), but he doesn't need a title to define him.  He is a presence.\n\t\"A Fistful of Dollars\" familiarized the world with the magnetism of Clint Eastwood, but it also popularized the spaghetti western (one could instead refer to it as the Italian western, but that would be too politically correct), a now much-lampooned sub-genre that slapped the Hollywood western in the face and smacked some sense into its overtly bright and patriotic adventures.  A gaga assembly line of close-ups, uncomfortable silences, sweat, and gunfights, the spaghetti western laughed at Roy Rogers and Randolph Scott hard.  Riding into the sunset or wrangling an unruly horse were now stale, predictable.  The spaghetti western pushed the Old West into the borders of Mexico and made sure to prove that violent sadism can be just as brilliantly conceived as a long-tracking shot in a healthily budgeted Hollywood thriller.\n\tThe Man With No Name is billed as an anti-hero, a gunfighter almost as villainous as the said-villains but ultimately too clever to be marked as a stock rival.  In \"A Fistful of Dollars,\" he finds himself in San Miguel, a tiny border town that is caught in the feud between two powerful families wanting to gain control of the territory.  The Man With No Name sees opportunity among the bitter rivalry; by countering the families against each other, he would thereby receive the monetary benefits of the soon-to-be massacred parties.  \n\tTruth be told, there are no nice people in \"A Fistful of Dollars.\" They are all so obsessed with furthering their own statuses that any sort of morality has been dead and gone for years, guns and money currently serving as the only forms of life's importance.  Many have rendered the film as being a tepid exercise in arty bloodshed, but that would only be true if it had the same Technicolor innocence as a Roy Rogers or Randolph Scott movie (there those names are again!).  I have always asked myself two questions when it comes to movie violence: (1) Does the violence feel out of place, not matched by the tone of previous scenes? (2) Do you leave the theater so disturbed by the carnage that it serves as the only thing you remember about the film a year later?\n\tUltimately, these are probably stupid questions to ask, as they do not directly apply to \"A Fistful of Dollars.\" It creates and lives in its own universe.  You aren't entirely sure what year it takes place in, where San Miguel actually sits, and how these characters became so outrageously handy when it comes to gunplay.  Violence is a part of the equilibrium.  In San Miguel, the kill-or-be-killed philosophy is shown in its truest form.  No pistol parties would be as harmful as banning breathing.\n\tSergio Leone is as inventive as Alfred Hitchcock or Steven Spielberg, but because he, along with his films, attract only a small demographic of people, his popularity wanes down to that of a cult filmmaker.  For someone who promoted a new genre and perfected it single-handedly, he deserves much more credit.  As his first hugely influential film, \"A Fistful of Dollars\" doesn't have the same unbearably tense patience of his spaghetti masterpiece, \"Once Upon a Time in West,\" but it is so outwardly daring that you can still feel the aftershocks of the groundbreaking waves it made back in 1964.  His style has been imitated time and time again, but still intact is that original underlying feeling that no one has done this before.  It is a provocative and flashy work that walks alone on a dusty path in the desert of cinema.  \n\tWith its flaws in mind, saying Leone was finding his footing wouldn't be entirely accurate.  In \"A Fistful of Dollars,\" you see him trying something unheard of with much luster, and it's immediately apparent that a snowball effect will ensue: The more movies Leone makes, the better they will get.  Though he only directed a total of seven, they all contain enough personality to bolster the projects of director who has made hundreds of movies.  \"A Fistful of Dollars\" is certainly one of them.",

The atmosphere is superb. Time flies and this is nothing but enjoyable. Guns, punchlines, horses, ricocheting bullets, girls and bad guys - it got it all. It may seem a bit over the top, even clicheful, but it takes it to the maximum limit and it all works out brilliantly. It never feel overdone or stupid, just perfectly timed and entertaining - I want more horse chasing scenes in today's movies. Fancy cars don't got anything on horses in 100 km/h.\n\nThere are also several camera treats here, they are well placed and capture scenes from great angles. Stylistic stuff. The first from Sergio Leone's trilogy about \"The Man with No Name\" and I believe it the first true \"Spaghetti Western\" as well and a remake of Kurosawa's \"Yojimbo\", a director I haven seen anything of yet. I'm really looking forward to the next two, but I'm afraid that they can't be as good with increased playtimes. Sure they can, but right now, it seem hard to top this.\nThat final scene is flawless and a perfect ending for a very good film.\n\n9.5 out of 10 caskets.",

            "content": "A Fistful of Dollars is a story about a small Western town that is being terrorized by 2 gangs. Then a quiet stranger wanders into town, and he manages to pit these 2 organizations against one another in hopes that he can profit from it. The most interesting aspect of this film was that Clint Eastwood did not play a traditional white-hat type of character. He wasn't particularly altruistic, he just wanted a paycheck. That actually gave his character some depth, and kept me guessing as to when he would reach a breaking point and decide that a job was going a bit too far for him. The biggest issue I had with the film was the audio. Apparently the actors were all talking in multiple different languages and they just dubbed in all the lines. Even Eastwood, who is speaking English, doesn't totally line up his lips to the words so it's clear they used ADR for him too. It is an awkward experience watching the unsynched dialogue, and I think some of the acting performances suffer because I'm not even sure they are actually saying the words that are being put in their mouth. That's the biggest hurdle to enjoying A Fistful of Dollars. Once I got past that, it was a very good film.\n\nThere are 2 things I think we all can admit that Sergio Leone is the master of in his spaghetti-westerns. First of all the music. It has this unique style that mixes a number of sounds you don't often find in film scores, which have now become synonymous with Westerns. It just fits so perfectly and it is used brilliantly throughout the film. But the bigger one is the fact that Sergio Leone is the master of the stand-off. That final sequence where Eastwood comes face-to-face with his enemies is so intense. Even though it had been spoiled for me by Back to the Future 2, there were still some surprising moments in the end. That is the kind of satisfying conclusion that the audience craves. We see the anti-hero going mano-a-mano against the villian and only one of them will be able to walk away. That whole sequence alone is probably better than most action movies I've seen this year. The movie did drag at a few points getting there, but once you hit that moment it's all been worth the wait. I can't wait to explore the other movies in Leone's Man-With-No-Name Trilogy, because I imagine he only got better. For Western fans A Fistful of Dollars is a must-see.",

The juxtaposition of the town in the landscape makes for a very dismal and miserable place where there exists no prosperity or joy for the residents but the constant reminder of death and brutality at the hands of those who control power. Thus one resides to being docile and making the care necessities of life the priority.\n\nAlong comes the cynical rogue gunslinger who'd do anything to get rich even going to the point of inciting a war between two rivaling factions. He has adapted himself to the this tough world and has mastered the trades to flourish within it. He's apathetic but his actions reveals that he once had a good human heart. Clint Eastwood plays the character with roughness akin to a razor blade scraping a rock. He's never deterred and his own rules and conviction which inadvertently causes a chain of events that results in a bloody massacre. He's not someone who we root for, because his motives are unclear and always has a sinister, in addition to a indifferent, connotation.\n\nThe film is anything but triumphant, because in the end the actions of the protagonist never changes the direction of the cruel world he inhabits but he merely exists to propagate it. Although whenever he sees a glimpse of real human feeling of love trickling through the hard layer of misery and despair, he knows it's a rare thing and he does everything to make it escape before it vanishes. He cannot feel love, because his heart's gone too cold and he cannot change the grim world because that's the only place where he knows how to live. He just straddles along in his horse waiting for his next fix of violence and gold.",

Eastwood makes himself a mercenary for hire, first to the Mexican family, The Rojo's, who control the town's liquor, but then switches to the other side, The Baxter's, who control the town's firearms.\nEastwood is superb as the mystery man with little to no honour or morality, a man who can speak entire sentences without having any dialogue through his facial expressions alone.\nThough A Fistful Of Dollars is nowhere near as good as The Good, The Bad & The Ugly, it does make a great first installment to a classic trilogy of films.",

The idea of a western film can be easy to do on paper, but delivery and direction is the most important part of any movie. A Fistful of Dollars perfectly captures the western feel while having a great atmosphere of the dark and grittiness. This is when the grit was actually good and had things to back it up as these were the times bodies dropped like flies. Clint Eastwood as the unknown traveling cowboy is one of the best characters in the genre because of how much he does. The man sees that there is a town in danger because of a power struggle between two groups as the government cannot do anything as even they get slaughtered by the rouges. The film also explores into a nice sense of humor at little bits that really gets you to feel how everyone feels, again creating the western atmosphere correctly. I even love how the overall set up for this film works out, it makes you wonder what is going to happen. There are many scenes that make you wonder what is happening and seeing things end one at a time easily fulfills the plot with a great pace. The best part to a good build up though is the suspense and when things start firing it keeps getting more and more suspenseful. A masterful film, and even saying that doesn't fully honor A Fistful of Dollars. It easily stands up to the test of time and easily keeps Clint Eastwood as the western icon.",

With a smartly written, acted and directed story you\ncan't help but watch this and enjoy it and take in the sights of this\nwonderfully set movie. I enjoyed all of it and for those who enjoy\nwesterns I couldn't recommend this more as a piece. I felt it was a an\nExcellent and Great film and below is why I felt that about it, and so\nmany other people did too.\n\nThe story as I say is smart and well thought out, and with some great\ncharacters and parallel families, it just makes for one big and fun\nwestern, oh and with some bloody violence too. I guess to say this is\nfun is the wrong word and although it is hugely enjoyable the story is\ndark and makes for drama at some points, but then goes into some good\nold gun shoot outs(including the old extremely loud gunshots we got in\nclassic western films). Finally we get a character who guides us\nthrough a slow plot but he does it so well it seems even faster.\n\nClint Eastwood in the main role without a name is superb and his\nmenacing voice coupled with his great performance makes for an\ninteresting acting role indeed. I loved the supporting cast and even\nthough no one stands out anywhere near Eastwood, they still do a great\njob and do what all supporting casts should do even today in film.\nFinally on the acting it is strong, for some films like this they don't\nall do well but in this you feel everyone does what there meant to do\nall the way through.\n\nDirector Sergio Leone does his job here every well and if it wasn't for\nthe other films in the Man With No Name series then this would be his\nfinest by far. He also had a hand in writing this as well and with a\nmassive writing team we got a great script that when put together with\nthe film is just superb. I liked the chase scenes, gun scenes and\nanything in the beautiful landscape and for when this was made the\nquality of the stunts and deaths are great and they don't seem cheesy\nat all which can happen so often in films of this era.\n\nI felt criticism wise that although it warrants very very little, the\nstory could be seen as over dramatic and too much cheesy lines and\nviolence that doesn't fit in with the more quiet scenes. I don't feel\nthey affected it and weren't cheesy etc but that is what could be said\nabout the film. As I have said before I think you have to form your own\nopinion if you like it or not as I couldn't really find much to\ncriticise this about really.\n\nI would Recommend this to those who enjoy a good western film or those\nwho like a good bit of action but it also being drama and tense moments\nwhere a shoot-out could happen any second. I believe many will enjoy\nthis as the story is thick with smartly written lines and I said about\nthe tense shoot-outs, well they are every tense and in a sense you\ncould describe this film as a thriller film because sometimes your\nheart can beat faster when the more quiet stand off's are around.\n\nOverall I give it a high 8/10 and it is a Great and Excellent film and a firm\none of that. I think some will like this film even more than I do,\nwhere as some I believe will dislike it, but the only way to find out\nis to watch it, because the film is classic cinema using one of if not\nthe most famous western star of all time in Clint Eastwood. Finally I\nwill say this is a must for all cinema lovers as it is truly a cinema\nclassic and to say this is in the series that includes \"The Good The\nBad And The Ugly\" it really is a great series of films, just excellent.",

It's the first in the series, and as much as I haven't gotten into the series till now, A Fistful of Dollars makes it challenging for me to watch A Few Dollars More, because this regarded 'classic' didn't necessarily blow me away. It's a solid western, featuring Clint (never fails), but as I have heard, lays the template for the next films where Leone really begins to take his form as an epic storyteller.\n\nClint Eastwood is the man with no name, who decides to stay around a bad town, where the only money that comes through is for booze and guns. It's small town, run by two gangs, the Baxters and the Rohos. When a small town like this one has two bosses, it never goes well. The Man is warned to leave unless he wants to be shot dead, but he sees a fair opportunity to make a few dollars. He approaches both gangs offering his work, but not for cheap. Both gangs get interested in him, and let him help with their objective. What both groups don't know, is that The Man is playing both sides, trying to take advantage of everyone for his gain. Everybody's packin' heat, but The Man is confident he'll come away with the last laugh.\n\nIt is an iconic movie, but I feel like it is the stepping stone in this series. It's a legendary series, one of the biggest in cinematic history, but 'A Fistful' kind of feels like a bit of a prologue to what could possibly be two much more enthralling entries. I haven't seen the other two, but from what I've heard from some people, is that the whole thing really picks up with a Few Dollars More and The Good, The Bad, The Ugly. That being said, it isn't necessarily a bad thing. I like to think that great series are built like this. A first movie that doesn't really wow, but leaves room for it later. There are a lot of series where the original movie can blow you away, but leaves nothing for the sequels that come off as lackluster. I feel it's the exact opposite here, where the trilogy will only get more entertaining with each passage. Still, A Fistful of Dollars is an entertaining movie.\n\nA couple things bothered me. One, it may have been a bit too short. If we saw a little bit more interaction between Clint and the two gangs, showing his fake dedication and watching it grow, only to come down to an even greater finale, I think that would have worked well. Maybe this isn't the case, but I still think that the finale here is a great one. The movie really does slow sometimes, but it's a couple of different iconic scenes in here that make the whole movie a bit more badass. Clint Eastwood is badass per usual, but not really as much as I'm used to. It was like a reserved badassery, but maybe that's the nature of his character. When it comes to cons, the acting is pretty B-Level (not surprising to me really), and the dubs for some of the characters (who I presume are speaking italian) are pretty shotty. It's still a solid western, that has atleast captured some of my interest to check out the next one.\n\nA Fistful of Dollars acts as a stepping stone for the rest of the 'Dollars Trilogy'. While expecting more, it's still a solid spaghetti western with some memorable scenes.",

I'm not big into old Westerns, so I don't have a lot of experience in saying what's a good Western and what's not, but I can confidently say this movie, really the entire trilogy, should be watched at least once.  \nEastwood is so smooth as the gunfighter, so charismatic, it's easy to see how the character is one of Hollywood's most recognizable icons.  He is the alpha definition of the lone good guy anti-hero from which other great characters, including Han Solo, were born.\nThe plot is such a recognizable plot now.  Skilled fighter breezes into a town ruled by feuding gangs, then plays the system where the gangs devour themselves while he walks away a little richer (in spirit?).  It's almost like this is how Romeo & Juliet should play out instead of the way it did.  And since the plot is borrowed from Yojimbo, it bears noting again the genius of Akria Kurosawa who directed that and Seven Samurai.  The stories are masterpieces.  They're so easy and simple to comprehend, and lend themselves to nearly any time and situation, much like many of Shakespeare's plays.  It takes a genius to create a template for a tale that speaks to a basic, understood element of the human condition.  In this case, the nature of the hero, even one who doesn't want to seem comfortable with the role.",

            "content": "Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns are my transition to Western films in general. They were the first Western films that I truly appreciated. After Leone's trilogy, this led me to other western films like The Magnificent Seven and 3:10 To Yuma. A Fistful of Dollars was the first of the trilogy and in my opinion is the weakest out of the three.\r\n\r\nThe film was written by a couple of writers, one of which includes Sergio Leone. This is the area of the film that I felt was the weakest as simple the plot may be, it lacks a strong build up to the memorable and exciting climax. The characters aren't as interesting in this film in comparison to the subsequent films, an example of poorly written characters in this film are The Baxters. They feel two dimensional and plain. I did enjoy the banter between Clint Eastwood and Jose Calvo. The dialogue in this film feels a lot more cheesier than the other films, most of it is good but there are moments that feels cringe-worthy. It is definitely a big risk in creating a protagonist with no background, it can be hard to empathise with but at the same time it allows the audience to become curious of the character and allows him to become unpredictable. The film's plot showcases the protagonist's greed and it's aftermath.\r\n\r\nThe film's biggest strength is Leone's direction. Leone wanted to create something different from other westerns and focused on building tension between events making it much more effective. Leone has created something patient and at times quiet, in particular the first few minutes of the film. The film is definitely limited by it's budget, with the setting feeling plain and lifeless.\r\n\r\nMassimo Dallamano is the cinematographer of this film, and also for the next film. Dallamano and Leone has focused on using close ups and at times they are extreme. These shots are commonly found on iconic moments of the film, like the climax or the switch in the middle of the film. The film's overall look feels much more grittier, this may be due to budget constraints or the filmmakers are not as confident with their shots in comparison to the subsequent films. There is a particular scene, which I thought was beautifully done and the scene was the first time we see Eastwood uses his gun, having the camera placed low and shooting it on the point of view of the gun.\r\n\r\nOne of the most memorable aspect of this film is the score. Ennio Morricone has created something that sticks with you and have you thinking of his score when you ever think of a Western situation. The beautiful sound of the guitar as it plays Eastwood out and that whistle that sticks with you throughout the film. The score is definitely influenced from the previous released Western films in that era but makes it his own. The score doesn't try to sound complicated or innovative but rather stripping it down, which fits the protagonist of the film.\r\n\r\nEastwood definitely stands out in this film, as his character and his portrayal of it is the main reason people are so hooked to this film. Eastwood has created a character that makes the audience wonder and at times idolise as he never seems to get corrupted by the cliche things found in Westerns, aside from money of course. The other stand out in this film is Gian Maria Volonte playing the film's antagonist and Jose Calvo as Silvanito. Volonte creates a villain that doesn't feel over the top and times look really cool and slick, while Calvo plays as the comic relief supported by the banter between him and Eastwood.\r\n\r\nThis film may not be perfect in my eyes, while other praise it. It definitely is an important film for me as it introduced me to a genre of film that I never thought I would appreciate. A Fistful of Dollars sets up the style and genre that is found on Leone's next few films.",

Another positive here was definitely the action sequences as well as the build-up of the conflict. Both really hooked you in and left you wanting more, while providing thrill after thrill.\n\nDespite those positives, there are some definite negatives. One of the biggest ones would be the shootouts actually, as when somebody gets shot, it looks extremely fake. Now, watching this in 2014 and comparing it to films of today is unfair, but regardless, even with the 1960's technology available to them, I really wish that he at least looked somewhat realistic and not just completely acted. Another would be the dubbing. For when this film came out, it is impressive, but at times, it was painfully noticeable and really hampered my enjoyment of the film. \n\nHowever, aside from these two things, I really enjoyed this one. It is a great way to kick off the \"Man With No Name\" trilogy and serves as a strong introduction to Clint Eastwood's character and, really, Sergio Leone's style.",

The story is about \"Joe\" or simply, the Man with No Name, as he takes on a war in a forgotten little town that is run by death and misery. It is up to \"Joe\" to end this war and bring peace and happiness to the town as it once was. I can't express my happiness of how this film turned out. It has been MANY years since its release and still stands out. The performances are just stunning especially from the legendary, Clint Eastwood, who delivers a badass mysterious bounty hunter/killer. The movie IS pretty long, but that didn't stop me from having fun with this movie. Seriously, this movie is THAT old and yet it never kept me bored. The gun battles are well done and the setting is just perfect. The final fight scene is probably the most badass and most recognizable scenes to date. Having Back to the Future parody this scene and yet it is still pretty badass. No matter how old this film is, it still holds very well and it gave one iconic actor his most iconic role yet. I got nothing else to say about A Fistful, but it is just a pure badass western..........go see it.",

It's extreme closeups weren't something seen in westerns often, especially American westerns. The fantastic and quick editing gives it that style I talked about.

He keeps it cool though, the coolest yet.  Like Leone's other works, the film has plenty of style with an epic and violent tone.  The visual quality is good and the audio is post synchronized, which presents the same issues as it did in the 1966 finale/prequel.  Ennio Morricone's score is beautiful, yet an order of magnitude smaller than his work on \"TGTBaTU\" or \"Once Upon a Time in the West.\"  I would say that the moments of greatness manage to justify the plethora of similar films that would follow.

He is one of the greatest characters i have ever seen along with 'the godfather'.\nThe film itself is an amazing watch it rejuvantes the western genre, Joe wearing the Poncho with his cigar and squinting eyes and rugged beard and an amazing confidence which i admire.\nThe score is very recognisable and works so well, they use it awful lot but it makes the character seem more powerful.\nOne of my favourite parts of the film is when Joe walks upto the four cowboys who think they can mock anyone. Joe with his head tilted downwards lifts his hat up and asks them to apologize very calmly and shoots all four of them so quickly and this is when i see his true power.\nThe film is directed by Sergio Leone and the film was known as a spaghetti western made in Italy and differed from the classic western with cowboys and Indians this one involves the mexican Outlaws and A lone ranger. Although some cliches exsit with a typical damsel in distress and the guns and clothing. Theres also typical stereotypes including the bad guys being bad, the towns people remain scared and hidden.\nJoe is like a middle man in this film, he intends on flushing out the bad guys out, like most westerns the woman in distress is saved by Joe valiantly.\nJoe really does walkaway with 'a fistful of Dollars' by tricking the good guys and the bad but has to endure torture and little blood on his hands.\nClints persona in this film carried on during his time as an actor and is such a true actor and makes me jelous of his presence.\nCinemotagraphy the film uses cliched super zoom shots showing emotion, Joes squinting eyes is enough to disturb any man. Long shots and for for the shoot showing shadows of the midday sun is nothing new but Sergio films has some of the actors flaws which show the film was set in europe. With some actors voices being pretty poor as they are italians playing mexicans can be spotted especially the little boy when he cries 'mama'.\nOverall the film is an amazingly crafted film flourishing the talents of Clint Eastwood and is worth the watch.",
