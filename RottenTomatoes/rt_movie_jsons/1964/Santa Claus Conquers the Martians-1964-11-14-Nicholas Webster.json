    "summary": "Martian ruler Kimar (Leonard Hicks) is upset that the children of Mars are lazy and under the influence of too much pop culture from Earth. They are obsessed with the planet's television programs and don't want to do much of anything. In an attempt to get the kids peppy again, Kimar orders the kidnapping of Santa Claus (John Call), hoping that the jolly old toymaker will know how to cheer the children up again. But two Earth children are also nabbed, and this complicates things for Kimar.",

            "content": "In almost all ways I can think of, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is a pretty terrible film.  Now, there are numerous good things I can say, at the very least:  There is some creativity behind the concept, the way that Santa is treated as semi-magic and semi-believably realistic is a neat approach (like how negative people can become optimistic simply by being near him long enough, like some kind of Joy Radiation), the acting by the adults is adequate, and I like how the main Martian character actually treats Santa and the kids with a sincere respect and compassion is genuinely nice.  However, the movie makes way too many miscalculations, as well as fails on a number of fundamental levels, to be enjoyable (outside of the MST3K treatment).  Perhaps the most glaringly obvious flaw is that over 90% of the movie takes place in a spaceship, or on Mars, meaning that there's nothing like snow, carolers, Christmas decorations or trees, and even any Christmas music (despite most of it being Public Domain by the time this film was made); this is further hampered by the fact that there is primary Plot Thread in the latter half about making gifts, but all of these gifts are shown on their own (without any packaging/bows/wrapping paper).  This results in a Christmas movie with virtually no Christmas visuals whatsoever, outside of the presence of Santa that is.  Worse, the film then drops most of the previous Plot Threads and instead turns into a Social Commentary of the negatives of Mass Production due to Industrial Efficiency, and not in any meaningful way, like pollution or the replacement of workers with automation; instead it just goes with some Old-Man Logic (for lack of a better term) of \"Things not made by hand just aren't the same,\" despite nothing involving the automation itself actually causing any problems, such as easily-broken toys.  But perhaps worst of all, the movie has an almost invisible Tone; for the most part I can't tell if it's trying to be a Fantasy/Sci-Fi, a simplistic Children's film, an outright Comedy/Dramedy or what, but then it ends with a climax that is purely played for laughs, and in the most loud and in-your-face way imaginable.  Seriously, it literally ends with a group of alien warriors (literally there to commit murder!!) getting defeated by a ton of bouncy-balls, squirt-guns and bursts of confetti!  Now, half of the blame can also be placed at the feet of the writing and directing as well, which just makes this Climax clash in Tone from the rest of the movie, and attempts to make this funny, but instead just makes it loud, obnoxious, jarring and, I'll say it again: LOUD!  This might be the most headache-inducing climax I can recall, capping off what was a work of Low-Tier Mediocrity with unquestionably the worst part of the movie, capped off with an equally loud ending song (repeated from the opening) that just left me exhausted after watching.  It's a Christmas movie, so by virtue of this classification you're supposed to feel SOMETHING else, such as joy, enthusiasm or a sense of wonder, but no, this movie just made me feel drained.  Sad, as the entire movie is bad, but the first two Acts were at least watchable, only to be capped off by a genuinely awful crescendo.  Ah well - at last the MST3K episode is pretty great.",

For starters, this film was so painful to watch, it felt like I watched the movie for three dreadful hours. Speaking of painful, the acting was beyond bad that this film came off as genuinely painful. The writing is also painful because the story of aliens capturing Santa to bring Christmas to their planet after discovering Earth is outright ridiculous all because if sentient lifeforms actually found the planet Earth for the first time in 4.5 billion years, I personally doubt they would be interested in the planet's holiday traditions. Horrible costumes that look like they were homemade as an arts and crafts project for some kid's elementary school. The makeup was also bad since the people behind this film just took a stereotypical Martian look and put it on the actors. Awful music as well especially since the opening song is annoying, high-pitched, and even sounds actually distorted and like it was recorded by a really old or low-functioning camera. What was also dreadful was the phony special effects and fake fighting. It was neither special nor effective. Santa Claus Conquers the Martians has failures all across the board: annoying music, wooden acting, cheap costumes, lazy writing, pathetic makeup, phony visuals, fake fighting, and cheesy art direction. Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is nothing more than a hunk of coal.",

The set up has Martians from mars with green paint on their faces questioning why their own children look so unhappy, so they devise a plan to kidnap Santa Claus from the planet earth.  And by the time they get to earth, they bump into a couple of kids and informed them that the real Santa lives in the North Pole which is exactly where they went taking along with them are the 2 children, since they had just found out their real intentions and don't like the idea of the real Santa being kidnapped.  The two kids unsuccessfully did make attempts to warn him, but was later captured by a fake looking robot which is obviously a guy wearing a fake looking robot suit sent by the Martians themselves- also their is also a guy wearing a fake looking polar bear suit who walks with his hands and knees. To say anymore would be pointless, but the thing is that I have no idea how I was able to watch this all the way through without cringing as opposed to some big budgeted movies.  And I guess it's because I've used to see my fair share of movies similar to this one during my younger years which it wouldn't take much to entertain me, meaning that low budget production costs is sometimes not a requirement to watch some of these movies intended for kids going into pre-school. Let's see, their was \"Electric Company\", Mister Rogers\" to \"Sesame Street\" which it wouldn't take much to get children entertained when people are wearing fake looking costumes and bad makeup. I don't hate this since it's demographic is clearly obvious, but at the same time I don't like it either. \r\n\r\n2 out of 4 stars",

            "content": "This is a classic example of a bad movie. \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" does everything wrong that concerns film production. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is terrible, and more importantly, the special effects are terrible. Yet it's enjoyably cheesy. When you watch it for the first time, you can't help but laugh at what is going on in the film. Oh, it's bad all right, but rest assured, you can get a chuckle here and there. \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" is a bad movie, but it is definitely worth viewing.\n\nThe story is that the children of Mars have become depressed and have not experienced any fun whatsoever. So the Martians come to Earth and kidnap Santa Claus to bring joy and laughter back to the planet. That's pretty much it.\n\n\"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" is just as silly and stupid as it may seem. The story is executed poorly. Santa Claus does not conquer the Martians, he only brings joy and happiness to the planet. The dialogue is terrible as it sounds like the actors are forcing it out of their mouths. Oh the acting; it's as bland and awful as it can get. There is no effort or amount of seriousness into the movie from the actors. There's even a moment at the beginning of the film where you can clearly tell that there is someone inside a polar bear and a robot suit.\n\nSpeaking of the special effects, everything looks fake. Take the aforementioned robot and polar bear; they are so cheap, it looks like you can see the actor inside the suit. Yes, this movie was made on a low budget, but come on, at least put some effort into the production. In fact, most of the costumes look like they were bought at a custume store. The use of stock footage is cliched and the actual effects look like they were made out of cardboard. \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" is a notoriously bad movie.\n\nYet it's friggin' hilarious! This is one of those movies you just need to see to believe, and laugh at the absurdity of it all.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" is bad, but you will still get a laugh for what it's worth.",

            "content": "A curiously bad film that tries to be sweet and heartwarming. Of course, it is really an incompetent mess of a production that has very few redeeming characteristics.\r\n\r\nBut, the one redeeming characteristic that I really want to start with is, believe it or not, the actor who plays Santa Claus himself. He is played by the relatively competent John Call. It's a shame he never really became anything. I'm pretty sure that this film annihilated his career, but I feel like he could have made a decent living portraying Santa Claus for the rest of his life. Sure, that would have been a terrible life, but he already did this film. After that, there's not really a long ways down.\r\n\r\nBut besides that one actor, every other aspect of this movie is just an embarrassment. The sets look stupid, the makeup effects are dreadful, and the actors are annoying as hell. One such character is Dropo who is so incredibly irritating that I'm surprised the other Martians didn't push him into the vacuum of space on their way to the planet Earth.\r\n\r\nNow the plot of this movie makes about as much sense as the title does. No, this is not a movie in which Santa Claus gears up his machine guns and starts slaughtering evil Martian invaders. Instead, the Martians take Santa to Mars and force--erm, politely ask--him to make every Martian toys for Christmas. It's not much of a plot, but, then again, this isn't much of a movie. It's tedious and dragging and doesn't keep consistent with what's going on in the story, but, hell, I have to admit it tries. The fact that the audience can even *tell* that it's trying to be heartwarming must mean something.\r\n\r\nHere's my question with a movie like this: how does a person sit down a typewriter, write out this film, and genuinely expects it to be a good film? How does that even happen? How can they possibly write out scenario after scenario of Santa Claus talking to Martians and expects it to be worth anything more than an hour's worth of laughs by some college kids with nothing else better to do on a Monday night? This is a movie that feels like the product of an empty stomach and a producer who just couldn't possibly know any better. I can't hate this film, of course. But I do dislike it very much.\r\n\r\nI'm sure nothing I say is going to sway people one way or the other with this film. People who want to see just how bad a bad film can be and then laugh at it are going to see it. People who will never touch this film with a ten-foot pole are still going to stay away from it. Which do I recommend? Well, it is worth the laugh to see it, especially since it costs next to nothing to find a copy of it (a friend of mine was able to buy the film for a dime). At the same time, though, it doesn't really add anything to one's understanding of bad filmmaking. Everything about it just kind of hits the \"basic incompetence\" mark. I mean, yes, everything about it is DREADFULLY incompetent, but there's nothing about this film that really stands out. Probably its worst quality, in fact, is the way it seems to pass through one part of the audience's brain and out the next without ever hitting home with anything. It can be incredibly annoying, but that's only half the time. The rest of the film is either comically bad or simply stupid, and neither is really grounds for labeling this catastrophe as one of the absolute worst films ever made. But, yeah, it still definitely sucks and isn't entertaining in the least.\r\n1/10",

It's so incredibly inept and lame, yet you can see it, plain as day: They were utterly sincere!

It has a happy ending, that's two positives. It's really very inoffensive, that's three positives. \r\n\r\nIn fact, it's risen above how bad it is to become a really enjoyable thing to watch at the sheer awfulness. In other words, it really does have some of the Christmas spirit in it: It will make you laugh, or at least you'll be able to fall asleep on Christmas Eve watching it, with visions of really creepy guys in green suits and bad makeup dancing in your head.\r\n\r\nI give it 10% because it's 100% better than a zero for comic relief.

The rest of the movie feels so disjointed it's no wonder IMDB lists this as the only movie written by the 2 writers of this masterpiece and one of the 50 worst movies ever made.\nMartian children who watch Earth TV (?) are upset that they have no Santa.  Their wise elder has foreseen this and says Christmas must come to Mars.  So of course, Martians kidnap Santa.  Boredom ensues.\nThere didn't feel to be any cohesiveness with the story as it sort of goes from one plot point to another, to another, clumsily.  \n\nNote the same scene stock footage of the Air Force in Dr. Strangelove was used in this movie.",

I was hoping to see a movie where Santa goes and beats down on a few little green men. Turns out martian children are addicted to Earth's TV shows that contain Santa Claus. So what do the martian parents do? Head to Earth and kidnap the fat, red suited, jolly man. These green aliens snatch up two kids to lead them to Santa Claus. You know those cheesy robot outfits that are basically a silver box with painted tubes for limbs? Yea, there is one of those there too. CLASSIC! So Santa's fat rear is kidnapped and taken to Mars where Santa meets the Mar's children and starts laughing and keeps laughing till the kids do the same. A very odd scene. Upon further investigation, Santa finds out that the martians have no intention on letting him leave. Damn aliens, go get your own obese white guy. Apparently some of the martians try to do away with Santa, thinking it is making their people soft with toys and not weapons. Santa uses the power of \"holly jolly yuletide goodness\" and beats the martians. At the very end of the credits is a sing along with the theme. I think the punishment for singing this in public is 3 lashing. Goofy and far fetched movie. Not a must see but a good one to run in the background at a Christmas party, just to see the faces of the guests.",

This is a kids movie which looks like it was made by a bunch of kids using their allowance and lunch money to fund it. This is like a junior high audio visual production of the worst idea ever. Santa Claus is captured by Martians who need him to make their kids happy, but soon hear that Santa Claus may be a threat to Martian life. How? I don't know and neither does this movie? Like Plan 9 From Outer Space, this movie edits stock footaged in between bad actors walking around cheap seats. Maybe with the quick wit of MST3K, this movie may have been enjoyable as a way to waste 90 minutes, but this is terrible. There is a scene involving a polar bear that has to be scened to be believed. It's just a guy in a bear suit and a cheap bear suit at that.",
