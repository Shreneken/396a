Both Shirley Eaton and Tania Mallet, who played the Masterson sisters, and Lois Maxwell, who played Miss Moneypenny, were exceptionally attractive. Gert Frobe's portrayal of Goldfinger was appropriately sinister. The Oddjob character was a little startling and superfluous, as well as a sign of the destruction to come in the following movies.",

            "content": "A dazzling spy thriller with sizzling ladies alongside James Bond in one of his finest films!\n\nDirector Guy Hamilton, of Funeral in Berlin, Evil Under the Sun, and Remo Williams fame, starts off his directing run of James Bond pictures with his daring and slick espionage thriller Goldfinger (1964). Hamilton brings exciting gunfights, scary encounters with Oddjob, jaw-dropping ladies, creative espionage to test James Bond's spy skills. I found Goldfinger as thrilling, funny, and sexy as when I first saw it as a kid. Goldfinger is one of the greatest Bond films for sure.\n\nProducers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were right to keep Sean Connery on as James Bond since he perfectly embodies the character. I like that they gave Guy Hamilton a chance after Terence Young's two excellent opening Bond films. Hamilton gives even more fun and a moodier espionage vibe to his direction. Editor Peter R. Hunt's cuts are quick and sleek, giving Goldfinger energy and a brisk pace for a fast 110 minutes. Cinematographer Ted Moore has creative wide shots for Pussy Galore's plane flights and Bond's car chases. I like seeing all the perspectives of the gas bombs dropping to Bond fending off Goldfinger's fearsome henchman and chauffeur Oddjob. I adore Ted Moore's iconic framing of his close-up shot that introduces us to Honor Blackman's ethereal Pussy Galore. She really looks like Bond is in a dream. Goldfinger is magnificent.\n\nJames Bond author Ian Fleming came up with a brilliant supervillain with the mad Auric Goldfinger. His scheme to radiate and devalue the gold within Fort Knox is creative and clever for a novel concept. It's all about Goldfinger's own gold being increased in value and hurting American currency value on behalf of Auric Goldfinger's the Communist Chinese allies. Fleming creates crafty and edgy ideas from killing off the Bond girl to Bond getting captured and used by Goldfinger for his fiendish plot. Screenwriters Richard Maibaum, Berkely Mather, and Paul Dehn create witty one liners for Bond to spout to taunt his enemies, while also writing romantic dialogue for when Bond is being a cad towards Pussy Galore or the other Bond girls here..\n\nSean Connery continues to astonish and delight as English secret agent James Bond. Connery is the ideal James Bond. Connery kills it for the intricate action choreography, charming flirtations with Pussy Galore, and hilarious insults to Gert Fr\u00f6be's massive Bond villain Goldfinger. Fr\u00f6be's Goldfinger is entertaining as the amiable Goldfinger as he gives Bond every chance to escape and thwart his evil plot. His clear hatred of Bond is shown in his smears and scowls. I love his legendary line, \"No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!\" that's delivered with a menacing cavalier glee. Goldfinger is overly confident in his convoluted plan to attack Fort Knox in a brazen move by a fearsome foe. Alongside Harold Sakata's deliriously fun toadie Oddjob, Goldfinger brings on the evil. His imposing stature and neat hat throws always entertain me whenever Oddjob smirks or strikes out against Bond.\n\nHonor Blackman is so dreamy and flirty as Goldfinger's unforgettable Bond girl Pussy Galore. She's captivating as a villainess, stern as James Bond's love interest, and skilled as an ace pilot. She's drop dead gorgeous with a voluptuous figure, lovely translucent blue eyes, cute golden locks, an elegant English accent, and a sheer confidence most Bong girls could never quite compare. Honor Blackman remains one of the prettiest and coolest Bond girls as her enchanting Pussy Galore. \n\nShirley Eaton is breathtaking as the sultry Bond girl Jill Masterson in her black bikini against her pale white skin. Her playful flirting with Bond is fun and it's still shocking seeing her stunning figure all painted in glossy gold. Tania Mallet is so pretty and charming as Tania Masterson with her sniper rifle, fast driving, and all black jumpsuit. Bernard Lee is funny as the dry British humored MI6 chief M. Lois Maxwell is the perfect Miss Moneypenny with her cute flirting with Sean Connery's Bond. Desmond Llewelyn is even funnier as MI6's equipment head, who gives Bond a tricked out Aston Martin luxury car with the works and a few neat tracking gadgets. Cec Linder is nice as CIA agent Felix Leiter, who aids Bond on his golden quest. Margaret Nolan gets a sweet cameo as the blonde Bond girl Dink in a bikini massaging Bond by a pool. Mai Ling must be mentioned as the sultry Asian stewardess Mei-Lei, who Pussy Galore orders to spy on Bond in a humorous sequence.\n\nProduction designer Ken Adam's sets are all magnificent with lavish estates and bases of Goldfinger's, but I'm especially pleased by Goldfinger's moving lounge where he shows his fellow crooks his maps and plans to knock off Fort Knox. Freda Pearson's 60's furniture is all warm in color and still stylish for its era. Art direction from Peter Murton, Maurice Pelling, and Michael White create elaborate bases of operation for Goldfinger and luxury planes for Pussy Galore to fly.\n\nComposer John Barry provides Goldfinger with a lush sound score that soothes you with his sensual melodies, and gives you a rush of adrenaline for his exuberant rushes of notes. Shirley Bassey sets the standard for powerful vocal performances for James Bond themes for the foreseeable future with her outstanding singing on \"Goldfinger.\" She has a rich voice to match Auric Goldfinger's finer tastes. John Barry's orchestration for the song is equally lush and befitting a lavish Rick Ross rap beat, like only fans with expensive taste could truly appreciate. What a fantastic Bond theme. It's so extravagant and bombastic with an eerie undertone. Sound designers Gordon K. McCallum and Dudley Messenger provide rushes of air when Oddjob throws his hat to massive car explosion noises and more for Goldfinger.\n\nMake-up artists Paul Rabiger and Basil Newall give each lady a stunning glow with cute blush and incredible volume for their hair. Pussy Galore's black jumpsuit in her plane to her chic purple pants suit are all so sexy and flattering on Honor Blackman. Oddjob and Bond's tuxedos from Anthony Sinclair are fitted and stylish, while Goldfinger's German aesthetic suits are fitting for his actor's Germanic heritage and style.\n\nOverall, Goldfinger is a blast and as interesting and dynamic as James Bond movies can muster.",

The iconic Aston Martin appears for the first time here, and with the car, the amazing gadgets. Also, this is the film where the 007 franchise enters definitively into the sci-fi territory. Goldfinger, the villain, has almost the same personality as Bond: they have the same sense of humour, they're both seductive (each in their own way) and they're both very intelligent. Compared to Dr No and Red Grant, Goldfinger is Bond's hardest opponent. His plan is as ingenious as Spectre's one in \"From Russia with Love\". Ms Galore (I'm sure if I write her first name my review will be banned) is another great Bondgirl: she is important for the plot, is the hardest one to seduce and has a strong personality. Oh, and I can't forget about Oddjob, the Korean mute henchman: he's at the same time funny and imposing, and surely the last guy you'd want to face. Furthermore, I think this is the first film that shows the villain's plan in execution, and the ending couldn't be more... James Bond!",

            "content": "It took until the third installment of the Ian Fleming-based James Bond spy movie franchise for its identity to crystallize. Following on the successful heels of Dr. No and From Russia with Love- both directed by Terence Young, Sean Connery's early mentor for the urbane leading role - Goldfinger marked a significant upgrade in production values that would make everything about the franchise iconic. Budgeted at more than the cost of the first two films combined, Goldfinger launched the ritual of beginning each subsequent Bond film with a stand-alone mission sequence for the fictional British MI6 agent, known by his code number 007, to show off his stuff. Other customs follow. An assignment meeting with British Secret Service head M allows for the otherwise autonomous Mr. Bond to have his feathers clipped while being informed of his latest mission. A little office flirtation with M's secretary Ms. Moneypenny segues into a meeting with resident gadget master Q, who gets Bond up to speed on the state-of-the-art devices that the audience can expect to see employed throughout the movie. From here on, female characters would be sexier and more dangerous, yet also more likely to die. Exotic set pieces would be epic in scale. The series' signature nuanced tone, straddling dualities such as dry humor and outrageous danger, would be more pronounced. Goldfinger is practically the template for the modern action blockbuster, yet still it's impossible to hate. In fact, it's deucedly hard not to love, simply because everything it does, it does so much better than its inheritors. A handful of other Bond flicks qualify as more \"serious\" suspense, and one (Skyfall) even borders on flawless. But Goldfinger will always be the best, for the same reason the Beatles will always be the best rock act and Peanuts will always be the best American comic strip: It's a phenomenon that defines its category.",

As much as I love Dr.No and From Russia with Love, I think Goldfinger is a serious contender for the best Bond film ever.\n\nFor me Goldfinger is the slickest of the Bond films in terms of how the stunts are performed and how the story is told. The story mayn't be the most exciting of all the Bonds, but it is still very gripping. The direction is sly, the cinematography is stylish, the locations are stunning and I can never get enough of the theme song sung by Shirley Bassey.\n\nThe script is sophisticated and humorous, while James Bond is still his suave and charismatic self, Pussy Galore is fabulously sexy and Auric Goldfinger himself ties with Blofeld as the best Bond villain, and a deliciously bizarre one he is too, being obsessed with gold and everything.\n\nOther than the theme song and Goldfinger, the action is what makes this film. I love the gadget designs which are wonderfully over-the-top, while my favourite scenes include Shirley Eaton's legendary gold-plated death, the duel with the bowler-hatted sidekick Oddjob and the midair showdown between Bond and Goldfinger.\n\nThe acting is superb. Sean Connery gives his best performance as the character of Bond, although Connery is the master of suavity and charisma he is even more suave and charismatic here. Honor Blackman is sexy and enthusiastic as Pussy Galore, while Gert Frobe is amazing as Goldfinger. Overall, a golden treasure and a serious contender for the best ever Bond. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The CIA has to come in and help him out in the end, he depressurizes a plane, and gets his butt handed to him in a fistfight with Odd Job. But these are far from complaints, and the movie still grandiose, exciting and nicely self-aware. There's beautiful Alps scenery, great comic book sets, the smokin' Honor Blackman, and it's got one of the really standout opening themes of the series. On top of that, there's the DB-5, which pretty much set the standard for spy cars for the past half century (and they don't come any sweeter).

Just his movement alone is so effortless. Otherwise, I don't really understand why this is a lot of people's favourite Sean Connery 007 outing, It's like his 4th best one lol.

            "content": "You know how when sometimes you watch a movie and you're like, \"I've seen that a thousand times.\" Well, chances are, that thing you've seen so often probably came from this third installment in the James Bond franchise. That's right, in this movie we're given super cool car with all the spy trimmings, the lethal bowler hat, and the tuxedo underneath the wetsuit.\n\nIf Dr. No was a detective story, and From Russia with Love was a action movie, then this movie, Goldfinger, is not only a spy movie as we know them today, but the one that spawned all the rest of the spy movies to come. \n\nNow, I didn't see the word Goldfinger written on any document or doorway in the film except in the title cards, so I was wrong about that in my previous podcast, but the other James Bond staples still held true, from the gun barrel to the opening action scene, and so on. \n\nAnd this opening action scene really does pull me right into the movie much more than the previous two movies did. Seeing the assassin's reflection in the girl's eyeball, tossing the electrical fan in the bathtub \u2014 which we'll see foreshadows another death that we'll get to \u2014 this is the stuff I sign up for when turning on a spy movie. And then it gets even better after the opening credits. \n\nI love how Bond is spying on the Gin game that Goldfinger is playing, making him loose. But let's talk about Goldfinger for a moment. I admit I was disappointed to see that he was just a bumbling rich old man who clearly wasn't going to be any physical match for Bond, but we'll talk about if his mind was a match for Bond. \n\nOf course Bond bangs the blonde working for Goldfinger, but I've got say, with as disposable as these girls are, I can't buy that he's at all that upset when he finds her dead golden body on the bed \u2014 it just doesn't seem like a believable motivation for him to go after Goldfinger. But let's talk about her dying by suffocation. I really don't think that's a thing, like your body can't suffocate because your skin can't breathe. Jim Carrey survived all the makeup from the Grinch, and Eddie Murphy as the Klumps. I'm just not buying that dead any more than I buy that Bond is emotionally disturbed by her murder. \n\nBut who presumably killed her? Goldfinger's henchman, Oddball. That's the bowler hat guy! Disney parodies this a lot, and the most stark reference that kept standing out to me was when Mr. Potato Head used his hat to stop the sliding doors from closing in Toy Story 2. But this is the kind of thing you see so often that you never stop to think about where it originated from, and it was right here. \n\nAnd let's not forget, James Bond has been showing himself as a hat tosser as well, as he makes it a habit to toss his hat on the rack whenever he's in Pennymoney's waiting room. \n\nAnd I'm so happy to finally be taken into Q Branch for the first time. And I'm even happier to be shown just how badass his car is! From the ejector button to the rotating license plate, this is all incredibly fun stuff! Now, I've always wanted a green Jurassic Park jeep, you know the ones where they drive on the tour that the T-rex destroys, but this movie gets me dangerously close to wanting a DB5 even more, especially after the car chase we see later on. \n\nI do love the golfing scene. It's nothing really you have to think about, it's just all set up as a joke, where Bond gets the best of Goldfinger, which will further fuel Goldfinger's vendetta against Bond. And this is where Oddball shows us his lethal talent with his hat, and I buy it, especially since Oddball never says a word in the whole movie. He's just all brute and threat, and I love it. I am, however, disappointed that he doesn't actually chop anyone's head off later like he demonstrated with that statue. But I do appreciate that the threat is there. \n\nAnd then we get a car chase scene, which isn't the big one quite yet, but it does feature the tire-stabbing hubcaps, and Bond meets the sister of the girl who was gilded at the beginning. And then once he picks her up, another more exciting car chase ensues, and this really does kick ass and we get to see the DB5 in all its glorious action, from releasing the blinding gas to spraying liquid, to ejecting his passenger \u2014 the only thing it didn't do was lift itself up on stilts for the oncoming car to pass underneath. Still, the Batmobile has nothing on this incredible. car. \n\nBut as incredible as it is, Bond still gets captured because of a trick mirror. And he finds himself in Goldfinger's laboratory, strapped to a table, with a lethal laser beam pointed at him. Now this scene was incredibly suspenseful! I kept trying to figure out how he was going to get out of this situation, and I just couldn't. I even love how indifferent Goldfinger was to him dying. Bond would try to negotiate, and Goldfinger just carried on with his scientists in idle chitchat. I could even go so far as to say that this is one of the greatest suspense scenes out there.\n\nLuckily he's saved by remembering two words: Operation Grand Slam. And Bond plays it smart. Are you willing to take that chance that 008 knows as much as I do? He'll replace me on the field and you won't know who he is. \n\nNow, Bond may have gotten out of this situation, but it's very odd that he spends literally the rest of the movie in captivity, AND he struggles to bag the next woman he meets. You'd think a woman named Pussy Galore would be more than happy to show him her \u2014 well, she eventually does, but it takes more work than Bond is used to exerting. \n\nOn that note, is his penis just made of super hero juice of some sort? If I have one ding against this franchise, it's that his magic Weiner seems to get him out of any situation so long as his hands aren't shackled so he can drop his pants. \n\nMaybe that's part of the charm of James Bond, I don't know. But to me, I see it as a crutch for the movies to fall on in when there's no other way for him to fight. It's funny enough though, that's it's not ruinous. \n\nBut you know what's NOT charming? That this movie's exotic location is Kentucky. That's where I live now, and let me tell you, there's nothing exotic about this place beyond the few grass fields they show. And then they make it look even trashier by showing us dumpy main streets and lots of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Sure there's a couple of horses and mint julep on the front porch, but if they're going to Kentucky, why not have a scene on steam boat or something to give it a little more appeal? \n\nBut we're in Kentucky to break into Fort Knox so that Goldfinger can get his hands on all the gold. And let's remember, Bond is still in captivity, which is really shocking. He's merely reactionary for most of this movie, which I guess isn't much different from Marty McFly in the Back to the Future movies, I suppose, but I expect James Bond to be the man to really steer events. \n\nRegardless of all of this, I'm still having loads of fun. He attacks his jail guard, Goldfinger transforms his speakeasy into a conference room, which really freaks out his money guys, there's lots of fun to be had here. I'm liking the humor, I'm liking Felix and his partner trying to keep up with Bond, but it's almost heartbreaking to see Bond's car smashed into a cube, as cool as that was to watch. \n\nAnd I know I've lightly complained about Bond being held captive throughout the rest of this movie, but it was fun wondering how in the world he was going to save the day, but Bond did break out of his cuffs just long enough to beat Oddball in a callback to when he tossed the electric fan in the bathtub at the beginning, because he really was no match for Oddball. And I did think it was funny that he had no hat throwing skills when it really mattered. \n\nAnd I found it interesting that it wasn't actually him who saved the day be turning the bomb off, it was somebody else.\n\nGoldfinger getting sucked out of the plane was just a little too cartoony to me, just as it was cartoony in Alien, but I go with it. I only wish they would make those windows just a little bit bigger so it'd be easier for me to buy into it. \n\nAnd just like the previous Bond movies it ends with Bond banging it out with the Bond girl, and the movie's over. \n\nNow let's rate this movie. This one's easy for me to rate. Is it a better movie than Dr. No and From Russia with Love? It's better than Dr. No, but From Russia with Love is still a finer, more sophisticated film. If I may make a contemporary comparison, if From Russia with Love is Captain America: Winter Soldier, then Goldfinger is Guardians of the Galaxy. It's sillier, and not to be taken seriously, and it involves really no brain power. But, it's more fun. And that's what I want in my movies, that's how I judge them. How much fun they are often determines the rewatch ability factory. And of all the Bond movies I'd re-watch that I've reviewed so far, it would be this one hands down. So I putting Goldfnger on my list at number 3. \n\nThat keeps Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri at the number one spot, and nothing yet at 2. Then From Russia with Love at 4, Dr. No at 5, nothing at 6. Bill and Ted Face the Music is at 7, Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is at 8, and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is at 9, and the worst movie of the bunch is Freaky, at number 10. Keep in mind that as I do these episodes, the scale will grow and change, so it will grow from 1-10 to 1-20 and so on. \n\nYou can find me on YouTube, just type in Should You Watch It?

A lot of the decisions made by the plot and the characters in the film are just downright illogical, Bond spends way more time playing around and trying to get laid then he does spying, and even his gadgets (like the ejector seat) were kind of lame. But, this is still a movie of firsts for the franchise, and did set the groundwork for following bond films, with better gadgets, iconic one-liners, and more action. I'll give it a pass because of the era in which this was made, but the fact that Bond almost pathologically controls and then (sometimes with force) sleeps with every single woman he sees is frightfully obvious, and really hard to ignore if you're used to watching modern films. Worth watching if you're a fan of the Bond series, but doesn't hold up well as an individual film. For a true bond classic, I'd recommend Goldeneye.",

Something I didn't understand though was why all of Goldfinger's employees wore this crappy uniform and were all Asian. Also James Bond forced himself on Pussy Galore in this film. There are definitely some writing issues in this film. The cinematography and visual effects were decent, and the soundtrack was excellent. The cover song is one of the best in the franchise.

But, although I know this is sacrilege to some, these Bond films are much better appreciated at Christmas time, with the family, or just found on TV one Sunday afternoon, or at someone else's house as an alternative to making conversation, or when I'll from work when a modern film wound make you feel worse. \n\nThese movies, particularly Connery era Bond, and particularly Goldfinger, with the beginnings and trappings of the Bond tropes, are good movies, but best viewed under the right context, and at the right time. \n\nBonus opening credits review: The first and perhaps the greatest Bond theme. There's simple and effective layering of images, is it teasing what's to come? There's a cool moment where a revolving spy number plate is superimposed over a woman's mouth which is quite an iconic image. And I mean, there's lots of gold, so there's that.",

He sees what this character is and how to portray it on screen to its best. And with finesse like his, the content subverts the flaws or inadequacies of the plotline and embraces the super-ness of the characters in this sketchy world. Finally, after two long chapters, the finest quality of this franchise, i.e. its antagonist, is magnified to an almost parallel role in this chapter. And carrying the title and the fear of his name, the snidy villain to Connery is perpetually playing a long tennis game with him.\n\nAn ace for an ace and a set for a set, if Sean Connery has gadgets in his pocket, Gert Frobe has a contingency plan in his mind, to every reply he has a counter argument that desimmates Connery's view for a whole act. Even in its last act, he never, mind you, never for a split second accepts his lose, at its most vulnerable point, he throws an equally challenging punch to our Martini-consumer host. One of the primary reason how the sense of urgency is kept alive throughout this two hours of journey, is the bluffs of Connery and Frobe's that are called out up front.\n\nAnd with almost an entire film, Connery spending under Frobe's shade, his cloaking or more accurately stripping of the revisited character has made to be \"out of touch\", in fact, he doesn't even get to say his name, \"Bond, James..\". The director Guy Hamilton brings less verbal sparrings in the script this time, which to be frankly seems like of barely twenty pages. Relying completely upon complex and witty physical sequences like an escape from a prison to stalling while shaving, these quiet moments on screen haunts us for the rest of the film, with not a monsterous face but a Goldfinger.",

In the movie, Bond sets out to thwart the gold-obsessed, international jeweler/smuggler Auric Goldfinger and his devious \"Operation Grand Slam\".  The plan?  Plant a dirty bomb at the U.S Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, irradiate most of the world's gold supply, and artificially hyper-inflate the value of his own gold.  After introducing us to the plot, the film is comprised mainly of Bond's espionage and sabotage of the plan, culminating in a final show-down with Goldfinger 10,000 feet in the air aboard his private jet.  Besides being wildly entertaining, the film also became a time a pioneer for the espionage movie genre, spawning many imitators in the years that followed.",

It's sad because as spy movies, THEY'RE GOOD but that mentality of how females should be treated (sleep/love me or DIE) that these movies are projecting shows this movie's age. Pussy Galore by herself was an excellent character (she trained 5 bombshells how to work as a unit and fly planes and she was a kick-ass pilot herself).

It still holds up now, at least most of the time. The writing and the attitude towards women is questionable at best and reprehensible at worst. Imagine if in a film nowadays a man forced himself onto a woman and romantic music started playing. There would be justifiable outrage, and it really marks the film out as a product of its time. The effects are also pretty laughable, as is the decision to artificially enhance the speed of cars chases by filming it in fast motion. Also, and I'm not sure whether this was intentional, but Bond is more of an observer in this film than a participant. Most of his time is spent as Goldfinger's prisoner, powerless to stop him. He could be easily disposed of course, but Bond Villain has to Bond Villain.

And I feel confident in saying I can see why.\n\nFirst of all, I thought the pacing, special effects, and villains were all improved in this film than in \"Dr. No\". This movie doesn't feel like it drags as often as the latter, thanks to the engaging script that offers plenty of surprises with the plot of the film and the villains and characters. The action scenes were also very entertaining. The filmmakers amped up the excitement scale with larger environments and some tense moments involving a bowler hat (even though some green screen effects looked obvious).\n\nMy favorite elements of this movie were the main villain, Goldfinger, and his henchman, Oddjob. Immediately when Goldfinger is introduced, he is shown to have hidden vices: he's cheating in a card game. And despite Oddjob's silence, he is a deadly opponent, with a cool hat-weapon ready to fire.\n\n*spoilers*\nThe one sequence that I thought was kind of convenient is near the end, when Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) turns good after Bond supposedly \"tames\" her (to understate things). I found it convenient because I don't think a woman would save a man after being in her situation, but on the other hand, in the franchise, Bond is shown to have enough charm over women to get what he wants, even if at their cost (like the woman painted in gold at the beginning).\n*end of spoilers*\n\nSo despite its somewhat flimsy ending, \"Goldfinger\" is still a very well-crafted thrill-ride with great action sequences, and great performances and characters.\n8/10",

Following on the successful heels of Dr. No and From Russia with Love- both directed by Terence Young, Sean Connery's early mentor for the urbane leading role - Goldfinger marked a significant upgrade in production values that would make everything about the franchise iconic.\nBudgeted at more than the cost of the first two films combined, Goldfinger launched the ritual of beginning each subsequent Bond film with a stand-alone mission sequence for the fictional British MI6 agent, known by his code number 007, to show off his stuff. Other customs follow. An assignment meeting with British Secret Service head M allows for the otherwise autonomous Mr. Bond to have his feathers clipped while being informed of his latest mission. A little office flirtation with M's secretary Ms. Moneypenny segues into a meeting with resident gadget master Q, who gets Bond up to speed on the state-of-the-art devices that the audience can expect to see employed throughout the movie. From here on, female characters would be sexier and more dangerous, yet also more likely to die. Exotic set pieces would be epic in scale. The series' signature nuanced tone, straddling dualities such as dry humor and outrageous danger, would be more pronounced.\nGoldfinger is practically the template for the modern action blockbuster, yet still it's impossible to hate. In fact, it's deucedly hard not to love, simply because everything it does, it does so much better than its inheritors. A handful of other Bond flicks qualify as more \"serious\" suspense, and one (Skyfall) even borders on flawless. But Goldfinger will always be the best, for the same reason the Beatles will always be the best rock act and Peanuts will always be the best American comic strip: It's a phenomenon that defines its category.",

It solidifies the successful formula and acts as the foundation that carries the series through the next fifty years. The Golfinger character is an iconic greedy villain with a bold plan to spike the cost of gold by blowing up Fort Knox. His henchman, Odd Job, has super strength and provides the needed physical opposition to complement such a thinking villain. Brining Bond to the United States for this adventure was a brilliant marketing move that greatly expanded the fan base of the franchise. Under Guy Hamilton's direction, this movie is a spectacle. It is more expensive and flexes a bigger in concept than the previous two movies. With stimulating global locations and sleek sexy interior set designs, this movie looks fantastic. There is incredible creativity with an abundance of forward-thinking gadgetry in this movie. Q's gadgets are one of the most important aspects differentiating Bond from other action movies. Some of the technology may seem dated, but if you remind yourself that it is set in 1964, you will appreciate the innovation that captivated audiences at the time. Sean Connery is in his peak here. He is funny, smart, charming, and convincingly tough with the action and fighting. Connery's physical movements, fashion, facial expressions, and attitude become a part of the character. It even influenced the way Ian Flemming's novels. All subsequent actors to play the role will face the comparison to Connery's performance in this movie. Female supporting roles played by Honor Blackman, Shirley Eaton, and Tania Mallet are memorable as well. This is the quintessential Bond movie; it is one of the most successful and probably the best all-around of the series. It captures its time beautifully and shaped action movies in general for years to come.",

            "content": "The third Bond film has been hailed by many critics as the Bondiest one of all, therefore ultimately the best in the series.  Unfortunately, they're wrong, and the movie is among the dullest of the Sean Connery 007s.  Why, you may ask?  So many reasons; but before we get to that, I'll roughly sketch out the plot. \n\nAfter a pre-intro credit sequence (the sequence being a particularly memorable highlight in the film), Bond finds himself in Miami spying on a gold dealer named Goldfinger, a brilliant criminal mastermind, and the movie's chief antagonist.  Bond finds Goldfinger poolside at a posh hotel where he's inexplicably cheating at gin rummy with the help of a telephoto lens wielding assistant (did I mention it's a sexy girl?) in a nearby hotel room who is feeding him his opponents cards via radio earpiece. Bond goes upstairs, and sexes her over to his side, and then is knocked out by Korean enforcer, and cheapest character in Goldeneye deathmatch, Oddjob.  When he wakes up, the girl he sexed earlier is dead and covered in gold paint.  Oops.\n\nThe film then transports Bond to merry ol' England, where he beats him at golf, then scenic Switzerland, where he discovers one of Goldfinger's evil plans, then on a private plane flown by Pussy Galore, the first of many ridiculously named Bond girls, and then finally to ... uh... rural Kentucky.  Yeah.  It's here that 007 learns the true nature of Goldfinger's devious plan: detonating an atomic device in Fort Knox, irradiating the US gold supply, and increasing his personal net worth in doing so. \n\nNow let's get to the meat of why this movie is dull as hell when it comes to Bond films.  First, there's an unnecessary long golf match, which is supposed to show how cunning Bond is, but was much more effective in the novel than it is on screen.  Secondly, after being put up against villains like Dr. No, Donald \"Red\" Grant, and the mysterious Number 1, being put up against an overweight ginger obsessed with Gold and his stocky Korean stereotype is a bit over the line.  The characters in general are simultaneously unbelievable and kitschy, but the plot attempts to take itself seriously, creating a continual contradiction that leaves the audience wondering if they should be laughing, or held in suspense.  This is visually supplemented by moments where footage of on-location filming is intercut with clearly green screened shots where there is absolutely no fathomable rationale for it to be occurring.      \n \nA good example of this is Goldfinger's harebrained scheme for getting his atomic device into Fort Knox: having Pussy Galore fly above the compound with five planes and release a nerve gas over the area killing all the guards, completely ignoring the fact that this wouldn't affect anyone inside a building, the amount of dispersion that would occur in the attempt, the concept of gas masks, and the difficult to factor conditions like wind, humidity and precipitation.  The way that Bond outwits Goldfinger's scheme is even more ridiculous and puts the movie into the over-the-top camp department of cinema, which is absurd and, considering it's the final act of the film, feels almost intellectually offensive to the viewer. \n \nBut if you can suspend your disbelief throughout all of that, you still have to wonder how a brilliant criminal mastermind like Goldfinger is actually a bumbling con artist that can't beat Bond in even the simplest of attempts.  It makes you really start to question how he got to be so powerful in the first place, and how nearly every female agent he has in his employ is so quick to turn on him when a dashing British agent comes along offering nothing but a one night stand in exchange to their presumably high-salary position. \n\nNearly half of the film takes place in Kentucky, since this is where the meat and potatoes of the plot is taking place, and boy, oh boy, is it a fucking snore.  Rather than cavorting in high class hotels, high roller casinos, and high alcohol bars, Bond has to stay on a ranch in rural southern America not doing much of anything.  There is possibly no place in the entire franchise where the character is more out of his element, and it clashes so severely with the mythos that you're left simultaneously scratching your head and wondering when it will all just end.   \n\nTL;DR - 5/10 \nInconsistent, dull, intellectually bankrupt.  Goldfinger has good moments, but they're peppered into a movie that is ultimately a chore to get through.  Unlike previous installments in the series, which had lower budgets, this movie relies on hat tips to fans and doesn't attempt to create a movie that stands well on its own two feet.  Much of this movie's success has to be based on nostalgia, and the established status that it already has, but if you go back to watch it now, grab an energy drink, cause it's a total slog.",

Ironically, it bares noting from the get-go that this was the first 007 flick to use the line \"A martini...shaken, not stirred\" as a calling card for the suavest and deadliest of superspies. Dr. No and From Russia with Love established the brand but Goldfinger put all of the elements to their most brilliant effect and gives all future 4-Star Bond chapters a run for their Moneypenny. \n\nIn this, the quintessential 007 film, James Bond (Connery) uncovers a plot to contaminate the Fort Knox gold reserve while investigating a gold magnate's (Gert Frobe) smuggling empire. \n\nThough his spyware started a slippery slope into camp from this film on (inflating dart in Live and Let Die; the invisible car in Die Another Day), the geeky gadgets keep up the cheeky cheer in this outing, Bond's seagull-hat disguise, Oddjob's (himself, one of the great series henchmen) steel-rimmed hat, and Goldfinger's laser among the best. Also, Q's laboratory first gets walked through, the Aston Martin first gets driven, and a pre-title action sequence first kicks off a new spy adventure (Robert Shaw choking out a foot solider wearing a Bond mask in From Russia with Love just doesn't count). Of all of the early films and their lasting effect on pop culture, Goldfinger uses all of the tricks in Bond's exploding briefcase to the most well-rounded heights. The tone, humor, casting, and action sequences fire on all cylinders in a perfect full circle of crazy cool entertainment. Future Bond movies would boast better examples of each of these elements but the 3rd film uses them consistently well and its riff-worthiness in the Internet age only speaks volumes as to its longevity and ability to kill audiences. \n\nBottom line: Midas Touche",

Yes Bond may have already firmly established himself in 2 previous outings but for some Goldfinger is the quintessential Bond movie and although I believe it to be a brilliant piece of cinema, for me it has never, even having watched it many times through my life, been what everyone hypes it up to be. Is that to say its bad, of course not. Goldfinger goes bold, it goes large, it gets the ball rolling thick and fast. While Bond is on, what he believe to be, holiday to Miami, he bumps into his old friend Felix Lieter, who asks him to observe a potential threat to national security Auric Goldfinger, soon however Bond finds himself biting off more than he can chew, as people around him start dying and he himself soon falls victim to Goldfingers grand plot. Goldfinger starts us off with some completely redundant mission, that never feels important or interesting, more convieniant and from then on minor gripes just continue throughout. I'll get the positive out of the way, Goldfinger is the first Bond movie to have a Bond theme, sung blisteringly by Shirley Bassie, it has turned the action, for that decade, up to 11 and has really upped the comedy value. Bond is now lighter than before with jokes aplenty, some brilliant, some not so much and completely hilarious over the top villain shenanigans. Bond himself is utterly fantastic, its clear as day now that Connery is relishing in every moment he gets to be Bond and he chews the screen up every chance he gets. The film also includes some wonderfully quirky characters, in the form of Pussy Galour, yes you read that right and Oddjob, they are iconic and extremely memorable. What the film does have, however is just everything that became preposterous about the franchise. A villain who although, always seems to be miles ahead of Bond, still decides to keep him alive and a decoration to his plan because... Well, just because. Goldfinger explains his operation to Bond, which proves to be detrimental as one might expect, in what the franchise is now ripped to shreds for, the old tell the good guy the plot before killing him, in such a way that he will escape. What adds more insult to injury is that Bond vanishes for a large chunk of this movie, deciding to pull the focus onto Goldfinger, a character who is so well written but so poorly acted by Gert Frobe. Goldfinger feels like a comedy bad guy and it sadly diffuses any tension that should be there, especially when Bond is being duped at every turn. Luckily the threat comes in the shape of Oddjob, if not emotionally but physically. I also have a huge gripe with the over abundance of screen work done on this film. There are huge segments where its so frighteningly clear that actors are having a conversation, in a studio, in front of a screen. I can excuse this during a car chase, I cant when you background is a group of people sun bathing, it cannot be that hard to achieve, you must have filmed it at some point, why not film the entire scene there instead. Maybe its down to time but its seriously noticable and hilariously criminal. The film does survive however and as the entity it is, is a hugely fun and bombastic experience, its not perfect and it lacks the tension that the first 2 films have. Although it is a welcome change to have more memorable characters and set pieces and having Bond go bold once in a while is not a bad thing, you cant help but feel this film opened up a huge can of worms. Essential yes, hugely overrated, hell yes.",

There's gadgets, an awesome theme song, car chases, fight scenes, tons of ladies and a villain with a crazy right hand man. Sean Connery returns in the third James Bond film this time going after a man named Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe). Goldfinger has a master plan to rob the US Gold Deposits at Fort Knox and it's up to 007 and his own cunningness to save the day. The movie is still dated compared to today's standards and some may find it cheesy with its numerous quips and puns, but man is it still an entertaining film. The film is less than two hours long and it may come off as a bit of a slow down in pacing half way through the film, but for me what works is Goldfinger himself. We have a villain that isn't like a typical villain. Yes, he eventually is taken down, but he is ruthless and is actually very intelligent. Why explain your master plan to your arch nemesis when you can just shoot a laser at him. Genius stuff. Overall, a great 007 film to check out!",

Considered by most to be the quintessential Bond film, \"Goldfinger'' is one of the greatest classic action films ever made.

Goldfinger's plan soon unfolds, and Bond must save the day again. \n\nSean Connery was the first actor to play Bond, and boy is he fantastic. His performance was charming and full of charisma. You can tell he really loves playing Bond. I was also surprised how great Gert Forbe was as the villain. He was intelligent, sophisticated, and silver tongued. \n\nThe production on this film is extremely impressive. This was made back in the sixties when there was no such thing as CGI. That means allot of great practical effects. The set pieces, gadgets, and action scenes in this film are top notch. The car chases alone were phenomenal. Every gadget was cool and stylized, and the stunts and fight scenes were very thrilling. I was also impressed with the camera work, but what stood out the most was the script. This is a very well written movie. It's incredibly smart, and it has brilliant dialogue. \n\n\"Goldfinger'' is the  quintessential Bond film, widely considered to be the very best one.

I know he can escape danger, but there's a difference between having swag, and trying to get every girl in bed, including your assassins and enemies. Come to think of it, Bond doesn't really have much character outside of the 'swag' idea. However he does have his moments and it's always enjoyable to see a person outsmart his enemies instead of outfight them. I also like how Bond keeps on getting into trouble, especially how he had so many failed escape attempts: that does bring some realism (unlike that other Bond film when he took on the entire North Korean army singlehanded). I do not remember the girls AT ALL. One was named Pussy, oh haha. One was painted in gold, ok... One screws everything up. The point i'm making is that they all are so similar to each other and have almost no personality that I just don't care for them. Where this movie shines is in its villains; Goldfinger and Oddjob. Gold is very intelligent but his temper and brutality makes him dangerously unpredictable. Oddjob's muteness and indestructibility makes him mysterious and really intimidating. Overall this film feels more like a superhero story than a spy movie, with Bond basically playing the role of Batman but with fewer bat-weapons. I don't know why this film is so famous though, I think it's overrated, at least by today's standards. Still good, but definitely not the Citizen Kane of action, or even spy movies.",

Not in a million years, I daresay. Hiring a German actor (Fr\u00f6be) to play the kingpin Goldfinger with his Cantonese-babbling henchmen and a Korean muscleman Oddjob (Sakata), the film's premise is not only politically incorrect and logically peculiar. \nread rest of my review on my blog: http://wp.me/p1eXom-1qj",

A fun\nwith that also packs a punch, Bond goes through a story with big\nvillains with monster like henchman and with everything sparkling In\ngold, what else you could you want from a Bond movie, I felt this film\nwas a safely very good and here below is why I felt that.\n\nThe Story is fast and fun and with big things going on and a very\ndramatic but action packed story, the plot is fun and brings you really\ninto the story. I loved the pace and where Bond goes and who he meets\nwith some spectacular sets and parts where it may be slightly slower\nbut then suddenly it speeds up and. Finally with the plot it has a good\namount of thrilling parts, with the beginning and end being that, with\nthe middle of the plot sandwich being Bond figuring out what is going\non, great stuff.\n\nConnery does well in the lead role again and firmly brings out what we\nwant to see from Bond, and with his gadgets and such to help, Connery\nisn't left without any help in his third outing to entertain us. I\nliked the villain Auric Goldfinger but it has to be said most of his\nshots when he is being his ever evil self involve Oddjob his devout\nhenchman who's hat throwing skills make his of the most memorable\npeople from this film if not of any film in the Bond series. Honor\nBlackman as the Bond girl I didn't feel was massively good but she\ncarries Bond along well and make a different Bond girl than most of\nthem we see.\n\nThe script was good and contributes highly to Connery's great one\nliners he dishes out al through the movie. I loved the gadgets involved\nand is one of the Bond's that is actually good with the use of gadgets,\nfor example like his Aston Martin with the revolving license plate and\nit's great gun's + more, you can't ask for much more in that\ndepartment. Finally technical wise, it feels very well done as a\nproduction and although some films around the time has shabby and dim\nlit sets, Bond's sets are great big ones and even one of the more\nhumble Bond's.\n\nThe film isn't without criticism, it has it's parts where it drags just\na little, but to be fair to the film the good parts basically make up\nfor the parts where it maybe slightly misses the mark. I also felt the\nstory is kind of ridiculous and that although most critics and audience\nalike like the film, many I feel would have to admit that the story Is\nkind of far fetched for even a Bond Movie, can't damn it for it's wacky\nideas though.\n\nBond fans should fall in love with this and probably already are with\nstereotypical Bond all the way through this, and with ease. Those who\nenjoy the three genres Bond is, Action, Adventure and Crime will not\ndispleased by this as it also represents them in a good way with the\nvillain being a good criminal, Bond fights a lot and with that he goes\nto a lot of different places also.\n\nI give this a low 8/10 meaning it is safely very good, I will disagree with\nthose who think it is a GREAT film but nevertheless I can see why they\nfeel that way about this. Connery really brings Bond to life here and\nwith thrill and a suave personality that just makes you want to see\nthem all, by far this is Connerys best and wouldn't be surprised if you\nthought this was THE best Bond film of the entire film series.",

There's definitely a healthy dose of the 1960s at play here, from the fashions on display to the attitudes of those wearing them, but in almost every single instance that results in a stronger, more vibrant cast. Despite their appallingly silly names, Oddjob, Pussy Galore and even Goldfinger himself are thoroughly deep, interesting, remarkable characters with a lot going on beneath the surface. The exploration of each villain's unique nooks and crannies, paired with an intensely curvy, unpredictable plot and the unmistakable presence of Bond himself, provides more fuel than any film could reasonably require. Quick in wit and in pace, it covers a lot of ground with admirable efficiency, leaves us with two fistfuls of memorable moments, and raises the stakes to staggering heights.

But what must we do with a strong female character in a Bond movie? We must throw her into a pile of hay and force ourselves on her until the power of Connery's penis enlightens her to the error of her ways. Fuck this movie. Fuck it right in the face. And you can take your \"context is everything, and it was a different time and relax, it's all in good fun\" and shove it right up your ass. Your glorious golden ass.",

This film features the famous Aston Martin with machine guns, ejector seat and bullet proof glass, as well as stellar performances from Sean Connery, Honor Blackman and Gert Frobe as Goldfinger. \n\n What I wasn't expecting was the in-your-face misogyny of this film. In one particularly offensive scene, Bond meets with his American colleague at a high end Miami resort, dismissing his latest sexual conquest with a smack on the backside, telling her there will be \"man talk\" that she could surely not grasp. \n\n Then there's Pussy Galore, a name lampooned by Mike Myers as Ivana Humpalot and Alotta Fagina in the Austin Powers films. I don't think film viewers would appreciate a male bond villain named Huge Cock or Big Dick, so I'm left dumbfounded by this naming stupidity, which carries on with future films such as Octopussy.\n\n This is where most Bond films lose my support. There's tongue-in-cheek sexual humour, which I understand, but what I see in Goldfinger is the blatant on screen objectification of women. For example, Pussy Galore is a committed villain, and business partner to Goldfinger - until having sex (once) with Bond. Apparently, 'uncloaking his dagger' changed Pussy Galore into an honest woman.",

Although there are still a lot that would instead name its follow-up, 'Goldfinger'.  I consider myself part of this group, because even when I was just a little boy, and only really liked James Bond because it was \"in\" to like him, I always felt that 'Goldfinger' had something else which was special.  Being now a knowledgeable enthusiast towards the entire franchise, I know that this one was really the first to contain both conflicting elements of an engaging thriller, and a camp comic-strip of silly stunts, sarky catchphrases, and dumb but beautiful girls who were still of an era when shooing away a woman, saying \"man talk\", and spanking her, would not have gotten you a broken nose.  Megalomaniacs were still convincing villains, and talking your nemesis to death instead of just shooting him was still considered an appropriate practice - but hey, I still think that this film was one of the most compelling of all the Bond films.  Not only is the Fort Knox plan surprisingly swallowable, but the pacing between action sequences is just as exciting as the rest.  Even the trusty CIA associate, Felix Leiter, is given something to do in this one.  'Goldfinger' is rightfully considered one of the very best in the extensively variable collection of Bond films.  A definite must-see for any fan.",

            "content": "Legendary movie moments continue in this 3rd chapter of the James Bond franchise. In particular there are 2 still frames that would become as famous as anything that had come before: a girl painted gold, and a giant laser threatening to slice Bond in half. There isn't a ton of new character development for the leads in this film, they stick with the well-known characterizations from the first 2. The big difference here is that everything is cranked up to be bigger and bolder. In fact I heard that this film had a budget larger than Dr. No and From Russia with Love combined. I'm not sure whether that's a good thing, because bigger isn't always better.\n\nConnery is still great, although he seems to be too tightly embracing the humor here. There are so many moments should be serious and intense, yet Connery almost seems to be chuckling under his breath at the absurdity of it all. Mercifully they opted for English-speaking Bond girls here, so they avoided the annoyance of rough dubbing. Or did they? No, now they decide to cast a German as their villain, so he must be dubbed and my annoyance continues. Thankfully Oddjob remains silent so there is no concern about dubbing there. The cast is good, aside from that minor quibble. It helps that the person providing the voice for Goldfinger is so emotive. Despite my upcoming complaint about the laser scene, Goldfinger's delivery of the line \"No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!\" is one of the best by any Bond villain in history.\n\nMy beef with this chapter of Bond is the fact that it is here they begin to succumb to the unrealistic. In the first 2 films some unlikely yet plausible things happen, but in Goldfinger we are basically asked to enter the realm of the fantastical. Car ejector seats, lasers to kill instead of a simple shot to the head, a razor-sharp hat that can slice marble, it all just extends my suspension of disbelief to its breaking point. The villains are seemingly morons now, \"Hey, he ducked his head down, I better go in that cell to see where he went.\" Bond seems to have a magical power in his *ahem* lips to reform women and turn them to his side. I like my heroes doing the improbable to win the day, but not the impossible. While Goldfinger is indeed a fun film, it falls short for me because it pushed the boundaries too far.",

Bond has to go through his most intense situations yet, such as an encounter with Goldfinger's pilot Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman), witnessing a woman covered in gold paint, and avoiding a deadly laser.\r\n\r\nOther stars in this film include Bernard Lee returning as M, Lois Maxwell returning as Moneypenny, Desmond Llewellyn returning as Q, Cec Linder appearing this time as CIA agent Felix Leiter, and Harold Sakata starring as Oddjobs, Goldfinger's henchman with a deadly boulder hat.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, this is Connery's best outing as Bond, in my opinion. After taking a step backwards with From Russia With Love, Goldfinger showcases Bond as we all know him. It also shows Bond using his most famous line for the first time- \"A martini. Shaken not stirred.\", and features 007 using more gadgets, in this film, we see an Ashton Martin with machine guns, and a mini tracker placed inside a person's shoe.\r\n\r\nThe action is an upgrade over From Russia With Love, and Goldfinger is one of Bond's best villains. Who could forget his line \"No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!\"? It's classic. Pussy Galore is a well-made character, and is probably one of the best Bond girls.\r\n\r\nMany of the action sequences are awesome, from the raid at Fort Knox, the opening pre-credits scene involving a bomb blast at a chemical plant, and Bond in action with his Ashton Martin. \r\n\r\nWith Goldfinger, 007 became a household name and became a legendary classic. For those who haven't seen it, you're in for a treat.\r\n\r\nThe end of my review for Goldfinger. But I will be back for my review for Thunderball, Connery's next outing as 007.",

            "content": "Here's the third James Bond movie, Goldfinger.\n\nPlot: After destroying a drug laboratory, James Bond is assigned to observe a bullion dealer named Auric Goldfinger. He starts by starting a relationship with one of his employees, Jill. But when Goldfinger find out, he has her killed by having his assistant Oddjob cover her in paint which kills her by 'epidermal suffocation'. Later Bond and the British Intelligence learn that his true plan is to smuggle gold internationally, so Bond has to find out how and - you guessed it - stop him.\n\nThis is another great film of James Bond. While it stops focusing on SPECTRE, it give us a new and rather unique villain and an also interesting sidekick. Oddjob especially I've more or less have been familiar with before because of the video game Nightfire where I learned about his special weapon, but apparently during the end of this movie, he ended up giving us a little more of what makes him quite the person for Bond to go up against. As for Goldfinger himself, he has especially been ranked # 49 in AFI's 100 Heroes and Villains list. And while I'm not totally sure I understand why he's such a great villain, especially considering what his master plan more or less turned out to be, I still can tell what makes him so popular. Despite whatever issues I have with his plan, it was still rather unique for someone whole has a love for gold and what he intends to do with it. Though honestly I would've liked to have seen more of him having Oddjob killing people with gold paint. I just thought that was fairly creative and I wished that I saw more of that. As for everything else, the story and action were very well done and the story especially seemed to have a big impact on the series as a whole. How that's the case, I\"m not completely sure, but obviously that's something that I'll find out about as I go further into these films. Also this is the film where we are given that laser scene. In other words, if you are wondering how so many TV shows especially have been making a big cliche out of a villain trying to dispose of a secret agent or other kind of hero by strapping them to a table and firing a laser that's working its way trying to kill the hero, this is the film that started it all. Other impacts this film made are the classic line \"A martini shaken not stirred\"  (which I think was more or less already said in the first movie by Dr. No, but I guess the way Bond said it worked well enough to make it a thing) and also the song Goldfinger which has become a very memorable song that they even played in the last Academy Awards.\n\nAnd that's y review for Goldfinger. It have us very memorable villains, great action and story, and a classical quote and song that makes it one of the best Bond film to apparently a lot of people.",

A classic shot of Shirley Eaton's gold painted body lying on the bed. Gert Frobe as the powerful Auric Goldfinger and Harold Sakata as the mute, bowler hat throwing Oddjob were brilliant. And Honor Blackman as the sexy Pussy Galore was also brilliant. I love the Aston Martin DB5 car that Sean Connery drives that's got almost everything from built-in machine guns, oil-slick, smoke screen, and a passenger ejector seat. I love how this movie takes place in the US at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Allthough, they shot the movie the U.K. It's awesome to know that this was the 1st movie that Pierce Brosnan saw when he was eleven years old and would later become James Bond himself. Goldfinger is without a doubt a James Bond action classic!",

No doubt that the film will go down in history as the film that defined the character of 007. Sean Connery's brilliant performance established the character's smooth persona. The opening fight scene alone is one of the most satisfying action scenes in all of James Bond's films, aptly ended with Connery uttering the hilarious pun, \"Shocking.\" Not to mention that Goldfinger marked the first time Bond orders his iconic drink \"shaken not stirred.\" \nUnfortunately, the film looks quite dated. The misogynist undertones in the way Bond controls women as well as the ridiculously sexist names like Pussy Galore come off today as too objectifying to overlook. The action scenes are cringe worthy, and the plot seems rather flat when compared to Bond's latest adventures. \nThat's not to detract from the fact that Goldfinger is required viewing for any Bond fan. This is the film that established the character as we have come to know it. It's also interesting to watch this film to see how far we've come since its release, both for the better and for the worse.",

Cars exploding before the even crash for example. When Bond seduces a girl, they literally role around in hay. Yuck yuck.\n\nBut I felt the bad guy was more a mastermind than really evil. Odd Job was fun, but seemed to not do much in the mid section there.\n\nThe woman were a huge problem too. They were all gorgeous for sure, but their development was awful. The sisters are both in and out of the film before you can even blink, and Pussy Galore is basically a hired female thug, but we never really understand her motivations in the end.\n\nThe final plane stuff was pretty awful too...when the plane is flying you can see the wires for one. Awful.\n\nTheme song is great. A five star movie was there, they just needed to polish a few things up.",

Of course, if for nothing else, this is one of the most parodied Bond films of the modern era, so I highly recommend it to all gen x/yers!  :)",

            "content": "\"Goldfinger\" Review:\nProbably the most famous of the classic James Bond films, Goldfinger has the perfect combination of over the top action and true peril and drama that makes this Bond outing one of the best ever made.\n\nThe third in the Sean Connery era, \"Goldfinger\" follows 007 tracking down multi-billionaire Auric Goldfinger who is plotting to radiate all the gold in Fort Knox to make him more wealthy. Along the way, Bond has to keep himself alive while made captive by the beautiful henchwoman Pussy Galore, as well as flirt with her in usual Bond fashion.\n\nThere's reason behind why this Bond film is the famous out of all the films. It not only coins his most associated catch phrase (\"Shaken, not stirred.\"), but also has the most famous Bond girl death (poor Jill getting painted in gold) and arguably the most famous henchman with Oddjob. The plot is suitably ridiculous, but the way they treat it makes you truly get invested in the action and actually believe the credibility of the plan. Goldfinger is a wonderfully unpleasant character and Bond is fantastic as usual. Pussy Galore, despite having a terrible name, is enjoyable as a Bond girl who's just as tough as she is gorgeous. \n\nA brilliant film, definitely a great starter film for any new Bond fan and a great film for long time fans as well. Definitely a must see if you haven't seen it already. (Real rating: 94%)",

The movie influence is a dark and unforgettable villain, Gert Fr\u00f6be do an magnificent work as Goldfinger; the 1st bad-ass Bond girl, a very good effort by Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore; the magnificent use of gadgets and an action scenes that make the establish a difference from other action films. Also the smart and a well adapted screenplay brings a series of influential scenes and dialogues: the girl bathed in gold paint, when Goldfinger threatens 007 with a laser beam when he was gagged, the chase with Bond's car and his lots of gadgets, the scene of the plane plummeting, the magnificent phrase \"A martini. Shaken, not stirred\", the sexy song of Shirley Bassey, among others. Guy Hamilton direction of \"Goldfinger\" is as perfect as \"A martini. Shaken, not stirred\".",

This is my review of Goldfinger. The story is about James Bond who has to prevent a gold smuggler known as Goldfinger from robbing Fort Knox but he is surrounded by henchmen including the sexy Pussy Galore and some guy named Oddjob who kills with his hats. In order to stop Goldfinger, Bond has to survive several situations including a huge deadly laser. Goldfinger is more sexier than the first two films and the clue was given right at the end of From Russia With Love, the second James Bond movie. The girls are hot as usual, the baddies are bad as usual and Sean Connery as James Bond is amazing as usual I think the only reason this movie has got a 96% as usual just like the first two movies is because the remaining four percent aren't fans of the franchise. If that is so, why don't you all fuck off and fuck yourself instead of hating on a beloved movie? Anyway Goldfinger gets a 9.8/10.",

Sure there were some amazing moments, but a lot of the movie was gimmicky and cheesy.  I mean, really, there was a long heated game of golf.  Serious movies that feature golf are not good.  It's like a rule, or something.\n\nGoldfinger follows Bond (Connery) as he follows bullion dealer Auric Goldfinger (Fr\u00f6be) in an attempt to determine how Goldfinger is smuggling gold internationally.  This involves playing golf and cards - played in a manner that really make Bond look like a jackass - screwing women, and the like.  Eventually Bond determines that Goldfinger is planning on robbing Fort Knox and must stop him.  Along the way Bond screws some women and people are killed with a hat.  Yes, a hat.\n\nOkay, so the awesome moments of this movie include when Shirley Eaton is killed by having her body covered in gold - this isn't a huge spoiler because it's basically the poster image for this movie.  The gold chick you see in everything Goldfinger related?  Yeah, that's Shirley Eaton.  There's also the gadgets, which for the most part are pretty cool, and Goldfinger tells Bond that he wants him to die, while pointing a laser at his crotch.  That moment is, in my opinion, probably the single most iconic moment of a James Bond film.  Sure there's \"Bond, James Bond\" and \"Shaken, not stirred\" but they're more catch phrases that you hear in most, if not all, of the films.  \"I expect you to die\" is just so iconic of this film, this series, this genre... it sent chills up my spine when it happened.\n\nDespite that, however, the film was actually rather boring.  It was slow, and despite only running for 2 hours seemed to last forever.  I found that I really just didn't care about this movie.  I spent most of it hoping that it would be over soon and disappointed to see that it wasn't.  Maybe a combination of the heat and school related stress are getting to me, because any reviews that I've read of Goldfinger say that it's a great movie, I just found it uninteresting.  It wasn't a bad movie it just... didn't captivate me.\n\nhttp://ishreviews.blogspot.ca/2012/08/goldfinger-1964.html",

            "content": "This is when James Bond really became James Bond.  When we think of 007 we think of cars with cool gadgets, and cheesy villains.  Sean Connery was the best Bond after Daniel Craig and this was the best film he did, and the best in the whole series after Skyfall, and Casino Royale.  The first two in the series Dr. No, and From Russia With Love were great, but not as great as this, because they were slower, and they didn't have all the gadgets that make the stereotypical 007 film that we love.  They had them, but not as much as this film did.  All the James Bond films are cheesy, but some of them are too cheesy.  This one was cheesy enough for it to be funny and entertaining, but not so much that the film couldn't be taken seriously at all.  That is why this is my favorite of the old ones.  What is good about Sean Connery is that he is like the Cary Grant of the 60's in the Bond films.  He sounds like him and was similar in personality to him.  He had the same leading man presence that Grant had too.  Which was perfect for a 60's Bond film.\n\nJames Bond (Sean Connery) is ordered by his superior M to go to Miami Beach to observe Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fr\u00f6be), a bullion dealer that is staying at the same hotel.  After bond catches Goldfinger cheating at gin rummy, and stops him he consummates the relationship with the employee he used to blackmail Goldfinger into losing.  He is knocked out by Goldfingers servant Oddjob (Harold Sakata)he wakes up and finds her dead covered in gold paint.  After he learns what Goldfinger's true mission is he arranges to meet Goldfinger and play golf with him.  He beats Goldfinger, and then follows him to Switzerland determined to find out how he smuggles Gold internationally.\n\nThis film gets parodied a lot in Austin Powers films.  OddJob's famous thing in this film is that he throws his hat and it breaks a statue.  In the first Austin Powers there is a guy who throws a shoe.  The 3rd Austin Powers film was called \"Goldmember\" which was a parody to the title of this film.  The Bond films have had a huge effect on the film industry, and the fact that they get parodied so often shows that.  This film is one of the most important films in the series, and it is one of the greatest films of all time.  It is the one Bond film in the book \"1001 movies you must see before you die.\"\n\nThis is a great movie that is fun, funny, and cheasy.  You can make fun of it without ruining it, which makes Bond films so special.  Also because this is only the third film it was still original and new.  After a while it got ruined because it became the same thing over and over again.  I liked this one because it felt so original at first.  The other Bond films were mostly decent, but they weren't as good until Daniel Craig came around and reinvented 007 and made it better.  This is a great classic overall.",

It has been for sometime now clear to me that this is far from one of the best entries, at least for me that is.  I do think the film is fine until Bond gets captured and then it just goes down hill,  Barry still gives us utter class and cue's like Odd Job's Pressing Engagement are toe tapping Bond brilliance but the Kentucky sequences really drag, Bond captured for most of the second half of the film does not equate to thrilling, one of the tags this film regularly earns\n\nConnery is on form although for me he hit his peak with the previous film, we get Q here for the first time actually referenced here as the character, although also previously in FRWL, he is just referred to as the equipment officer.   The Aston Martin makes it's debut, plenty of the tick the box moments that would go on to define James Bond films for decades to come.\n\nGert Frobe is a memorable villain in the title role.  Honour Blackman's Pussy Galore might be one of the most memorable Bond girls but she's far from the most attractive, I think Sick boy in Trainspotting said it best, \"that name is a compete f******* misnomer  I wouldn't touch her with yours\".  Cec Linder is a terrible Felix Leiter and just seems like some Bond lackey,  It feels like the second half completely undoes all the work the fine first half has done, the climax on board the plane is incredibly underwhelming and just silly.\n\nGoldfinger for me is like Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band, the Beatles have done much better work but it's regarded their most iconic and by that rationale also seen as their best, this for me is this film, the general public and critics hold it up on  a pedestal as a watermark of quality but despite it having some of the best moments and most memorable, it has a whole leaves allot to be desired but still continues to be called the best film in the series, I wonder if some of the people who make this claim just say it as it seems the right thing to do.",

In this film, Bond enters the fray with a clever Godfingerom that is going to make a bomb in Fort Knox - the treasury of the United States, where all the gold reserves in order to wreak havoc in the economy, and to become a master of the world. And in the early tapes of the 007 successfully combines intense development of the action (the final scene, when Bond stops the counter explosive device numbers 007, can be considered a classic - then this trick with minimal modifications used a million times in different movies in all parts of the world), a witty dialogue and a touch of irony to the authors portray.\n\nIt is difficult to understand why such \"non-serious\" picture perceived in the USSR too seriously and even hostile, considering reactionary bourgeois or even biased anti-Soviet. But after all the style of James Bond tape is like a comic, that is, speaking in Russian, with a book with amusing pictures. We should also mention the great game of Sean Connery, the first performer of the role of the famous British agent - his James Bond, of course, is inimitable and unique. And the music of John Barry (especially the treated main theme Monty Norman, which has long been called simply \"James Bond\") became the hallmark of the movie series, or \"James Bond\". Interestingly, in a similar definition of the newly formed loop unwittingly emphasizes just the mythology of its main character, who in the modern world as it took the place of archetypal characters in \"The Iliad\" and \"Odyssey.\"",

Goldfinger is one of the few Bond films to effectively capture and combine the gritty spy elements of the novels with the flashy, larger-than-life elements that have become a staple of the film series.  The fantastic and light-hearted elements win out in the end, but it's a good balance.  I have always preferred the darker, more plausible nature of the books, but the appeal of the films goes far beyond that, and it's an important reason why the Bond legacy has lasted as long as it has.  The film itself throws everything it has at the audience, immersing the viewer in the exciting, colorful, and dangerous world of 007.  Gert Frobe plays a delightfully menacing Auric Goldfinger, and Honor Blackman's Pussy Galore is one of the most memorable Bond girls in history, even if it's strictly because of the name.  Oddjob's brute physicality makes him a formidable henchman, but we never get to see him unleash his full bad self.  Other iconic Bond moments are introduced, including the first appearance of Q branch and the Aston Martin DB5 with \"a few optional extras\".  Connery's Bond is almost perfect, even if he lacks some of the bad-ass characteristics of the previous entry.  Still, he's only guy in the world who can pull off his spy outfit to reveal a perfectly pressed tuxedo underneath.",
