U.S. Air Force General Jack Ripper goes completely insane, and sends his bomber wing to destroy the U.S.S.R.

I personally think there isn't enough of these two stars on television, I really don't. I noticed a young James Earl Jones too, and the camera-work and direction were both excellent.

He isn't even named or pictured in the cast list! You wouldn't know he was in the movie. It's an outrage. The scenes that have stuck most chillingly in my memory for 55 years are the stark, single-light up-from-below shots of him puffing on a cigar, calmly explaining that he has set off the nuclear end of the world because of the Communist plot of fluoridation. His name in the cast list is a half-century overdue.",

            "content": "This film features a lot of dry wit and is a good piece of political satire. I liked how the various people, representing different aspects of the US (the military etc.) and other nationalities, are put together in close quarters in the war room, which inevitably lead to some clashes. This isn't the sort of film that offers lots of immediate laughs but I appreciated the quirky characters and there are certainly some rather amusing pieces of dialogue, one famous quote being 'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here, this is the war room!'. \n\nI found the phone calls made by various officials particularly amusing. One conversation features an official arguing with the person on the other end of the line that 'I'm capable of being just as sorry as you are' and consequently going off in a huff. There is a pointed sense of immaturity portrayed in the way that such people communicate with one another, which makes you think about the potential childishness, the one up-man ship aspect of war and of political confrontation generally I suppose. I found it somehow amusing that one of the characters kept referring to the Russians as the 'Ruskies'.\n\nI liked the various characters played by Peter Sellers. His characters are, unsurprisingly, quite comical in tone and have an edge of caricature about them. The film has a serious theme (the threat of nuclear war) and it does well at making us think what could happen. It has some distinctly comic moments within the script but it also poses some important questions, makes the viewer see the somewhat sinister side of megalomania and its certainly decent as a piece of thought provoking cinema. The fact its filmed in black and white is also quite well judged, I feel, as it gives it an almost timeless feel to it. The film dates from the mid 1960s, when most films were shot in colour as standard and given the very modern danger that was an all out nuclear war, at the time this film was made and initially released, its perhaps ironic that its shown in a normally quite dated way but it does give it a timeless feel somehow.\n\nThe plot is a bit meandering and it won't appeal to everyone but I'm glad I've seen it twice now as I feel I appreciate it more now and the first time I saw it, I really wasn't in the mood for this type of film (political satire) and indeed I stopped watching after half an hour or so. Given I saw the drama show Catch 20 recently, I could see some similarities and perhaps better understand where its coming from.\n\nI would recommend this to people in the mood for such a film, not an all out laugh a minute comedy or a light and easy watch as such and not for people hoping for constant fast paced action or war scenes but otherwise its a cult classic that I'd say is worth a watch.",

It is almost impossible to believe that Dr. Strangelove came from the same director as it tells most of its story though sharp satirical dialogue. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, humanity causes its own destruction through its intelligence. In Dr. Strangelove it's caused through humanity's incompetence.

I've probably said it in every Kubrick review I've written, but he is simply the master; pair him with Peter Sellers and they can't possibly make a bad movie. Sellers, like usual, plays multiple characters: A British RAF officer at the Air Force Base, the US President, and the titular, Dr. Strangelove. The phenomenal plot is a funny (and frightening) pretzel. A paranoid Air Force commander (Sterling Hayden) sends a signal to all B52 bombers to nuke their targets in the USSR because he's convinced the Soviets are attempting to \"pollute our precious bodily fluids\". However, the Soviets have created a \"Doomsday Machine\" that will automatically be triggered if any of the targets are hit. Therefore, the Americans and Soviets must work together to stop American planes from reaching their targets and ending the world. Who to root for messes with you. Major T.J. \"King\" Kong (Slim Pickens) and his crew are heroically attempting to carry out their mission, which, if successful, will end human life on Earth. Brig. Gen. Ripper's (Hayden) stoic concerns about his bodily fluids and Group Captain Mandrake (Sellers) seeming to riff off the cuff with him were my favorite scenes. But the film is filled with dry one-liners \u2014 \"You'll have to answer to the Coca-Cola company,\" \"Gentlemen! You can't fight in here! This is the War Room!\" \u2014 and iconic visuals. The most notable and parodied scene would be Slim Pickens riding the nuke like a bucking bronco, waving his cowboy hat in the air. Although Sellers is excellent throughout, I think George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson had the best performance. My only gripe with the film concerns Dr. Strangelove himself, that being, he's the iconic, titular character and barely in the thing. He delivers the famous final line, \"Mein Fuhrer, I can walk!\" as he rises from his wheelchair. I had thought he was so excited about being a part of the\u2026 re-population process \u2014 10 women to every man \u2014 but had also read it has been analyzed to mean that Dr. Strangelove, a former Nazi, was so thrilled with the re-emergence of a nascent fascist state in the new world order, but I think that's projection. Dr. Strangelove isn't for everyone, and it definitely must've hit differently in the mid-60s, when nuclear holocaust was a VERY real threat, but it's still one of the best satires and black comedies around.",

Kubrick was drawn to the ironies of how viewers could root for the crew of a B-52 to simultaneously succeed and fail, and also energized with the possibility of juggling three separate story lines at once. Dr. Strangelove keeps the nightmare scenario in which a American general goes nuts and decides to unilaterally start a nuclear war based on the book Red Alert and a lot of the other key plot points from the book. It's a fairly accurate yet overexaggerated  showcase of how a single delusional scenario could cause a ruckus across the world, and how human error can undo all the sophisticated technology the military can provide.

Why wouldn't anybody at the base have long since determined that General Ripper was crazy?

And it was very hard to believe that a nuclear bomber plane could be located, shot at, and damaged, but still be able to fly all the way to its target without further interference. (When Gary Powers' U-2 spy plane was detected by the Soviet air defense force in May 1960, they threw everything they had available at it until it was brought down.)\n\nA few laughs-\"Don't fight, this is the War Room!\" and such, but overall hardly a good movie.",

A fictional tale of the world on the brink of annihilation; the death of all living things by nuclear war, all because of a man's obsession of \"bodily fluids.\" This film feels so weird in Stanley Kubrick's filmography, which itself is a slew of ambitious, curious achievements. Having Kubrick make a comedy is odd right off the bat because he never made a comedy before or after. But this one is very distinctive, a political satire on the maddening mechanics that ran the Cold War. Like Kubrick's other films, this is visually unique and precise, probably the most visually stylized comedy of them all. But the brilliance in all its absurdity is how frighteningly accurate it was suppose to be. There was a huge likelihood that this kind of catastrophe could have occurred in the 1960s and with the relentless moronic political climate that going on at this very second, that possibility remains and it is nerve-wrecking to say the least. In the war room, the idiocy is revealed in all kinds of facets. \n\nDespite the brilliance in Kubrick's premise, I don't wholeheartedly appreciate this film's principles as a comedy. It is a pitch-black comedy right down to a T; it is completely offbeat but I didn't find all too funny. I think it is that sterile, dry coldness that is present in almost all Kubrick's films. But there are moments where I found myself very amused (particularly one scene with an American Soldier named Bat Guano) and its really the principle performances that first and foremost make the comedy work. George C. Scott seems like the master of scene-chewing (literally chewing gum in nearly every scene) and I could listen to him running amok all day. Of the three plot-treads, the scenes on the bomber plane were the least humorous. There is a certain repetitiveness to those scenes, which I think was intended. Adding to the building suspense and docu-style photography, there is the \"Ants go marching\" music constantly scoring those scenes, it presents the American bombers as an relentless force, determined to see their mission to the end. What better man to lead this flight to \"Valhalla\" character actor Slim Pickens as the cowboy pilot Captain Kong, which is just priceless. \n\nPerhaps the most memorable aspect of the film is Peter Seller's three separate performances and the comedic sensibilities here are perfect fit for the actor's style. Each of his performances are very distinct; over the top yet somehow understated. There is Captain Mandrake, a second in command trying to keep his \"British\" cool and make sense of the farces at play. President Muffley as the mediating American leader constantly frustrated by all the incompetence. And there is Dr. Strangelove, a narcotic German scientist who is possibly trying to bring back the Nazis ways after the impending doomsday. This is easily Peter Seller's best work. Overall, I am admire 'Dr. Strangelove' more for Kubrick's vision than its satirical comedy. This is not a ordinary farce, it is unconventional and fascinating. The suspense of the comedy is great, the performances are terrific and Kubrick's eye for detail remains astonishing. it is cool to know how this film was a crucial touchstone in Kubrick's career that would allow him to grow as a filmmaker outside of the studio system and create more outstanding work like \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", \"Full Metal Jacket\" and \"The Shining.\"",

But Dr. Strangelove is both a biting, incredibly prescient satire as well as an effective comedy at the surface level. The commentaries on modern society, military culture, machismo and sexuality, paranoia, and self-preservation are comprehensive and sharp. The comedy ranges from subtle to borderline ZAZ-esque (love the miniature Bible/Russian Phrases combination). The performances are pitch-perfect (which has as much to do with Kubrick's control, see Scott's reluctance to perform parodically) and Sellers multi-role work is amazing. Quite plainly, both the greatest film made by Kubrick, and the greatest political comedy ever made. (5/5)",

Kubrik masterfully brought that reality to life for me. So, while the film's gags are wholly outdated, the film's darkest joke, that nuclear war could begin at any moment because of nationalism, propaganda, inept leadership, pride, mistrust, and confusion hit very hard.\n\nWhile the jokes that might have eased the tension of the film's seriousness half a century ago don't work any more, the film is still every bit as relevant, scary, and strange as it was then.

Not exactly funny stuff at first glance but Kubrick's writing and directing make Dr. Strangelove a very entertaining and hilarious watch. Unfortunately, I found some sub-plots far more funny than others as the scenes in the rogue plane weren't filled with as much humor as the war room or the assault on the military base. Of course there are three main actors who are very entertaining to laugh at while in this situation that could mean the end of civilization. Peter Sellers (portraying three parts), George C. Scott as Gen. Turgidson, and Sterling Hayden as Gen. Ripper are all fantastic. The laughs hinge largely on their performances and they are busting out funny lines per se, but they remain unintentionally hilarious (at least portrayed that way, but Kubrick knew what he was doing). Once again, I particularly liked the scenes with Scott and 2 of Sellers' 3 characters, my favorite being Dr. Strangelove himself. I have to deduct points for its inconsistency though, as I found myself wanting more content of Scott yelling, Sellers talking to the Soviet leader via phone, and Dr. Strangelove trying to hold back his Nazi salutes rather than the dullness of the bomber scenes. Overall, Kubrick shows he is able to tackle any genre with meticulous, planned out thoughts that translate to a quality film.",

I still can't believe the different looks he pulled off (reminds me of Tilda in Suspiria).  There wasn't a dull moment and the imagery was fantastic esp'ly considering it was made 55 years ago (!!!!!!).  This movie was made for that time period (the Cold War) but strangely it's very applicable today too; and feels ahead of it's time.

            "content": "Aaah, why didn't I get this film? I wish I did, I really do, it's considered one of his best and one of the funniest films of all time but it didn't affect me in the same way it did most audiences. Most likely I am just not sophisticated enough to understand it's intelligent political satire and Kubrick is just working on another level. I will try to breakdown why and how I did not understand it and how I recognized points that I was meant to laugh at but just couldn't.\n\nThe film concerns the fallout from General Jack D. Ripper, Sterling Hayden, choosing to launch a nuclear attack on Russia without warning his military superiors or the Government. The majority of the film is then spent with the President, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, Dr. Strangelove, all Peter Sellers, and General Buck Turgidson, George C. Scott, as they attempt to stop those on the aircraft holding the nuclear weapons from deploying them. Onboard the aircraft Major T.J Kong struggles to make a decision with the mixed signals he is receiving leading to a supposedly darkly hilarious final shot.                                                     \n\nFirstly I have to admit that I have a problem with the film's star Peter Sellers. I have never found his slapstick style particularly funny in films like Only Two Can Play (1962) and his \"I'm a comedic actor giving a dramatic performance\" role in Being There (1979) just irked me. I think he is awful in the eponymous role of Dr. Strangelove, his German accent and failure to keep in his Nazi tendencies didn't elicit any laughter from me and it all seemed like something you would find on Whose Line Is It Anyway?. His American accent as the President slips to reveal that he is British, he is perfectly acceptable in this role but not particularly funny and after the shock of him playing multiple roles wears off we spend an awful lot of time with a performer that I feel no particular affection for. This is considered his signature film though and his portrayal of Dr. Strangelove with his reflective glasses is highly praised.\n\nGeorge C. Scott is an actor whose performances I have enjoyed in Petulia (1968) and Jane Eyre (1970) but here he gives a performance reminiscent of Brad Pitt in Inglourious Basterds (2009), this film probably inspired Pitt, another performance that I think is just bad acting instead of being an entertaining pastiche. His relationship with his secretary could have created some interesting comedic material but it all felt like the same old tired jokes about unprofessionalism and two immature dummies being in a relationship. The character makes the crucial mistake that drives plot but he never feels like the center of the film as we spend so much of our time with an array of Peter Sellers characters and Slim Pickens, who is giving one of the few good performances in the film.\n\nSlapstick humor is meant to be the primary source of laughter throughout with Sellers' struggling to hold himself back from performing a Nazi salute and the various political figures in the war room having physical scraps over the conflict at hand. Maybe this killed at the time with this style of comedy being more popular with mainstream audiences but with my modern comedic sensibilities I found it very difficult to enjoy a style of comedy I saw as outdated and it failed to make me crack up the way it did my Father, who was alive and well in the 1960s and appreciates modern slapstick like Dumb and Dumber (1994).\n\nI would not recommend this film but it's part of the Kubrick filmography so it is considered a classic no matter what it's actual quality is. I know that this emotionally affected many audiences and is seen as intellectually brilliant by most critics.

Stanley Kubrick (and writer Terry Southern) took a nuclear panic thriller and turned it into a comic satire \u00e2\" but the underlying reality of \u00e2our life with the bomb\u00e2? keeps terror and dread and sadness and shock only barely at bay; the comedy is a fig leaf on our existential horror.  The plot is straightforward:  General Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden) goes off his rocker and orders a nuclear strike on the USSR from the wing of B-52 bombers flying just two hours from their targets.  Although Group Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellers), an RAF officer serving as his executive officer tries to talk him out of it, he just gets nonsense about fluoridisation and precious bodily fluids in return. When General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott), Commander of the Joint Chiefs, finds out, he heads to the War Room to confer with President Merkin Muffley (also Peter Sellers).  In the meantime, we focus on one plane, piloted by Major \u00e2King\u00e2? Kong (Slim Perkins) that is steadily making its way to the target. In fact, once Attack Code R has been triggered they can\u00e2(TM)t be contacted (except with a special code) and can\u00e2(TM)t turn back.  You can see the lines of the thriller plot here:  Muffley calls in the Soviet Ambassador and gets the Premier on the line but they soon discover that the Russians have invented a Doomsday Machine that will automatically trigger in the event of an attack and shroud the world in radiation for 93 years.  Muffley\u00e2(TM)s advisor Dr Strangelove (a former Nazi, also played by Peter Sellers) offers not so reassuring advice about living underground (and developing a new world order).  It\u00e2(TM)s all played for laughs, broad ones.  Who can forget that shot of Slim Pickens riding the bomb like a bucking bronco to its destination and the final shots of mushroom clouds played off to the strains of \u00e2We\u00e2(TM)ll Meet Again\u00e2?? It\u00e2(TM)s all so pitch perfect and sadly, it can never become dated.  I guess we\u00e2(TM)ll have to laugh to keep from crying (now it\u00e2(TM)s anyone\u00e2(TM)s guess whether global warming or nuclear destruction will get us first!).",

            "content": "The funniest movie about the Cold War you'll ever watch!\n\nStanley Kubrick tried his hand at a dark comedy with Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) with hilarious results. This movie is filled with military nonsense jargon and political hyperbole that kept me constantly laughing.\n\nKubrick's direction is immaculate as ever with his long steady panning shots as characters walk towards the camera or down a hall. While his few close ups reveal astonishment or fear, the majority of Dr. Strangelove is shot with far wide shots and aerial viewpoints to demonstrate the enormity and insanity of the situation when you step back and look at it all. Kubrick uses many clever tricks to keep all three roles of Peter Sellers off screen from one another with very effective results. His experimental and sleek style made Kubrick's films a pleasure to watch and Dr. Strangelove is no exception.\n\nThe script from Kubrick is stuffed with the manic reactions and hysteria that nationalism brews in a sweet drink to choke on while you giggle away. Dr. Strangelove takes on nationalism, pride, command, stupidity, rank, power, and consequence with a grim sense of humor and an explosive finale. You have to see it to believe it.\n\nThe acting within Dr. Strangelove is even more fun than the silly script. Peter Sellers plays 3 separate men with 3 unique accents, namely: English, American, and German. Sellers brilliantly portrays Group Captain Lionel Mandrake as a shy, stuffy, and cowardly man of meek will and ridiculously calm demeanor giving his poor situation. Sellers mastered the art of pretending to be relaxed. while his character goes through some impressive mental gymnastics trying to reason with a madman. It's absolutely delightful to watch Sellers as Mandrake. Similarly, Sellers plays fictional American President Merkin Muffley as stern, thoughtful, and fastidious to the point of hilarity. His overly hurt tone is so funny to listen as he tries to comprehend the situation at hand. Lastly, Dr. Strangelove is Sellers going nuts as an ex-Nazi scientist with a lisp and an uncontrollable fascist hand. It's as funny as it sounds. Sellers makes the movie, but he is joined in good company.\n\nSpeaking of which, George C. Scott gives the funniest performance of his otherwise serious acting career. He displays fervent warmongering and manic desperation as he chews gum and give advice. Scott is so passionate and hysteric, his acting is all the more believable. He is probably my favorite role in Dr. Strangelove as Scott is essentially parodying his most character type in his other films as the commanding angry commander. George C. Scott is just hilarious as General Buck Turgidson.\n\nFinally, I must mention the furious insanity and raving lunacy in the very funny role from Sterling Hayden as Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper. Hayden starts out calm and collected issuing his mad orders with a presence of total confidence. As Dr. Strangelove goes on, Hayden perfectly demonstrates Ripper's obsession with conspiracy and paranoia over Communists with a nervous haze and a vigorous zeal. His speeches are both concerning and hilarious. He just keeps on ranting about Communists with such passion and fervor with no basis in anything he says that Dr. Strangelove just keeps getting funnier as you watch.\n\nThe madness will get to you eventually as Dr. Strangelove is one of the few comedies that is not only amusing, but also a brilliant display of filmmaking from Kubrick. Give it a watch if you can get your hands on The Criterion Collection restoration.",

The first in this series is the Stanley Kubrick classic Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.\nWhat initially strikes me on revisiting Dr Strangelove is that it's hard to believe that this is a Stanley Kubrick film , it differs so dramatically from anything else in his repertoire. Another clear sign of it's quality is that even though this film was originally released in 1964 it is as relevant today more than ever before. Given our current global political climate, stately satire from either the past or present now largely resembles reality and this film is no exception. The lampooning of the world leaders in this movie could be taken from the CCTV footage of a G8 Summit! \nOf course, the brilliance of Peter Sellers in multiple roles makes the whole thing tick but credit has to also be given to a superb supporting cast including George C. Scott and Slim Pickens who enable the wonderful script to come to life. \nIt's a movie that requires repeated viewing such is the large volume of comedy and it's subtly that many gags could be missed first time around.\nAll in all, a clever, relevant, funny and scary in equal measure movie that is well worth another look.\nBona fide classic",

            "content": "Stanley Kubrick is one of my favorite directors. I love how long and fruitful his career was, and how even though he wasn't perfect, he was self-reflexive. He had a vision for what movies could do and be, and made it his life mission to bring that to life. However, he didn't let his one-track mind get in the way of his reason. Rather than becoming a relic of the past, his vision grew and changed, and therefore, stayed relevant through his life and ours. I'm going to review a few of his movies in the coming weeks and I hope you join me for the ride.\n \nI'm starting with Dr. Strangelove. I've heard of the name \"Strangelove\" before, but thought it was a James Bond movie. But after learning it was a Kubrick film, and a highly regarded classic, I knew I had to check it out. The general gist of the film is that it is a satire of cold war paranoia and competition with the \"Russkies.\" To be honest, after seeing it, I wasn't blown away. It was funny and Peter Sellers was amazing in all three of his roles. For the time, it was one of the best satires of the cold war ever made (as seen by the raving review in The NY Times). It really shows the ridiculousness of our bureaucracy and incompetence of our military. I think it still holds up today, as we still have a very odd relationship with Russia, but the B52 bomber scenes are okay at best. It's the war room scenes and the scenes with Peter Sellers as Mandrake, and Jack Dr. Ripper (portrayed by Sterling Hayden), which really make it laughable and where the comedy and satire really shine through.\n \nThe plot is that Jack Ripper (we'll get the meanings of the names later), is a rogue military officer at the Burpleson Air Force Base. He initiates the B52 bombers (that are in the sky 24 hours a day around the article circle) to bomb Russia and heat up the cold war. He believes that the Russians are poisoning the U.S. water supplies because one time his sperm did not have its \"essence.\" Basically, the fragility of his masculinity set him off. The bombers are off to attack Russia and Ripper takes his base off the grid, to his executive officer Mandrake's dismay and fear (seeing that Ripper is out of his mind), and the war room scenes begin. The three main characters that are important in these scenes are - the president, Merkin Muffley, Buck Turgidson (Chief Army Officer to the Presient), and Dr. Strangelove (a former Nazi scientist who is now helping the U.S. design their bombs etc.). Strangelove changed his name from Merkwuerdigichliebe, once he became a citizen. It's up to these three to try to decide what to do about Ripper. In the meantime, Mandrake is trying to get the code from Ripper that can stop the planes, but Ripper refuses and holds Mandrake hostage. The President then calls in another army base close to Burpleson to get Ripper. Ripper and his men are unable to fight them off and Ripper commits suicide because he wouldn't be able to stand the torture they'd use on him to get the code. Mandrake, now free, finds the code and gives it to the President. The war room officials stop all the bombers (with the help from the Russian President Kissoff), except for one plane which ends up bombing the Russians and setting off their unstoppable doomsday device. The film ends with the song \"We'll meet again\" and a montage of mushroom clouds.\n \nLet's start with the music. There are only three songs in the whole film, two of which really stand out to me. One is the, \"the ants to marching two by two, hoorah, hoorah.\" This song only plays during the B52 scenes. To me, it's signaling that the soldiers are just ants or pawns in the War Room's eyes, but at the same time, they're the ones that cause the most destruction. Not only because of their pilot's blood thirstiness and \"commie\" hating attitude, but because of the incompetence of the politicians and generals controlling them. Not to mention, the Russian's doomsday device, which was only instituted because of their fear of the U.S. and the arms race. In the end, all fingers point back to the U.S.'s bureaucratic incompetence. It's hilariously dark. Next is the song, \"We'll meet again.\" This plays at the very end, right after Dr. Strangelove, who's wheel chair bound, realizes he can walk again. He declares, \"Mein Fuherer, I can walk!\" then the world ends. Before this, Strangelove was talking about how they could create mine shafts to store a population of U.S. citizens so they can continue the human race. \"We'll meet again\" refers to the fact that maybe the humans will rise again. Or, it could mean that the U.S. and the Russians will meet again if they both create mine shafts. Right before the doomsday device goes off, Gen. Turgidson is complaining about the \"mine shaft gap\" and the mine shaft race. Here, the comedy lies in their obsession with the cold war. The Americans are so paranoid about the Russians that they don't understand that the world is ending and where they're going, the arms race, space race, mine shaft race, won't matter.\n \nThe cinematography of course, is beautiful. I love the lighting, and the sets. The war room looks exactly what a \"war room\" would look like. I love the angles that Kubrick uses for the audience to see the power of the speakers. Whenever someone in the war room is anxious or trying to get their point of view across, the camera is angled looking up to show that they're in power. It also is there to make them look jarring, we can see the sweat on their face, the veins in their eyes, and spit coming out of their mouth when they talk. Dr. Strangelove is always shown with a zoomed in lens, his head in the center of the screen. Instead of us watching him, he's watching us. In addition, the title is great. I love how long it is and how it shows that this film will be a comedy. Originally, it was supposed to be a drama, but Kubrick rightly thought that the best way to get across cold war paranoia would be comedy. The film isn't laugh out loud funny, but it's not meant to be. It's supposed to make you think, and smile to yourself at how perverse it is.\n \nNow let's talk about the characters and their names. First, there's Peter Sellers who plays three characters in the film - Mandrake, Ripper's commanding officer, The President, Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove (previously known as Merkwuerdigichliebe, which in German means cherished fate). Seller is brilliant in all his roles. His delivery and accents are incredible, he just blends into everyone he plays. My favorite is of him as the president. I especially love how he talks with the Russian president like they're like little kids in a fight. \"I'm more sorry, you can't be more sorry than I am, well in that case, I'm sorry too.\" \"Of course, I like to talk to you, of course this is a friendly call,\" he says while breaking the news to Russia that their B52 bombers are there to destroy their country. As Mandrake, he's serious and brave. He's not cowardly for not wanting to fight alongside Ripper, he's smart in that he knows he shouldn't, for he needs to figure out the code to save the U.S. and the world. And though he does, his tries are futile. This can be seen not only at the ending, but with the fact that when he tries to call the president he doesn't have enough change no matter how many different types of calls he tries (collect, station to station, etc.). Eventually, he asks someone to shoot the coca cola machine. The guy shoots it but before he does he says, \"you're going to be in big trouble with the coca cola company.\" But we should talk about his performance as Dr. Strangelove, the Fuherer loving, Hitler Heiling, maniacal ex-Nazi, with a robotic arm with a mind of it's own trying to kill him. He's perhaps the smartest one in the room, but also the craziest. He and Turgidson is where the comedy comes from in these scenes. Strangelove, because he was a Nazi, and Turgidson, because he's an America loving blind patriot. They both do a great job at portraying their stereotypes.\n \nHere are some of the meanings of the names (as an English major, I eat this stuff up). Jack Ripper, the one who causes this whole mess sounds like Jack the Ripper, the serial killer in London. The Burpelson Air Force Base where he works, has the word burp in it (which I guess was funny at the time). Then there's Mandrake, a root or herb used to promote fertility (which Ripper seems to lack). Merkin Muffley, the president, is named after two slangs for \"female\" genitals. Showing that the U.S. \"lacks balls,\" but too much testosterone isn't good either, as seen with Turgidson and the pilot (nick named \"King Kong\") of the B52 bomber, who wants to go ahead and kill everything. Strangelove, is self-explanatory. He has a strange love, or a perverted love with wanting the world to end, and also with Hitler. I don't know too much about this, but I wonder if Dr. Strangelove was playing off Werner von Braun, the Nazi scientist the U.S. stole during the final days of the war in Europe. He helped start NASA and the Apollo program within it.\n \nThe only woman in the film is real life playboy model, Tracy Reed. We see her in the magazine being looked at by a male pilot and later with Turgidson in the exact same position as she was in the magazine, lying on her belly. She has one scene, but is only there to show how virile Turgidson is. Sexual undertones in the film can be seen throughout. Not only with the phallic imagery (from cigars to fuel engine tubes), but with the idea of the mine shafts (1 man to every 10 women to repopulate the earth), and Ripper's precious \"bodily fluids/essence.\" The one person of color in the film is a very young James Earl Jones. He plays one of the crew members in the main B52 bomber. Both Reed and Jones aren't given many lines or much to work with, they play their parts as tokens and that's about it. Neither of them are stereotypes though, or used for laughs, which is good, they're just basic supporting characters.\n \nLastly, Kubrick gives a lot of juxta positioning with peace and war. For example, \"peace is our profession\" is the logo of Burpleson Air Force Base. This sign can be seen when the two air forces (Burpleson vs. the one that the president sent to get Ripper) are killing each other because they each see each other as the enemy. Another darkly comedic scene caused by miscommunication, technology doing its job too well, and bureaucracy. There's also talk of the \"peace race\" to end the cold war. This is said by Russian Ambassador, who is also in the war room with them. He says that the Russians built the doomsday device because they couldn't keep up with the \"space race, arms race, and the peace race.\" The peace race and arms race being the same thing. The Russian Ambassador is the one who sends the codes to set off the doomsday device after hearing Strangelove's plan about the mineshafts because he knows the cold war will never end if they don't destroy the world, an extremely grim, but also very real outcome of the cold war. All the weapons on both sides function like they're supposed to, it's the human greed and competiveness that gets the best of the technology.\n \nAll in all, I give the film a 7/10. If you're into cold war satire and history, you'll like it just fine. But to me, the film is slow, and the comedy, though great and with a beautiful pay off, isn't enough to save it from aging.",

            "content": "Every time you see a great film, you find new things in it. Viewing Stanley Kubrick's \"Dr. Strangelove\" for perhaps the 10th time, I discovered what George C. Scott does with his face. His performance is the funniest thing in the movie--better even than the inspired triple performance by Peter Sellers or the nutjob general played by Sterling Hayden--but this time I found myself paying special attention to the tics and twitches, the grimaces and eyebrow archings, the sardonic smiles and gum-chewing, and I enjoyed the way Scott approached the role as a duet for voice and facial expression.\n\nThat can be dangerous for an actor. Directors often ask actors to underplay closer shots, because too much facial movement translates into mugging or overacting. Billy Wilder once asked Jack Lemmon for \"a little less\" so many takes in a row that Lemmon finally exploded: \"Whaddya want! Nothing?\" Lemmon recalls that Wilder raised his eyes to heaven: \"Please God!\" Kubrick, whose attention to the smallest detail in every frame was obsessive, would have been aware of George C. Scott's facial gymnastics, and yet he endorsed them, and when you watch \"Strangelove\" you can see why.\n\nScott's work is hidden in plain view. His face here is so plastic and mobile it reminds you of Jerry Lewis or Jim Carrey (in completely different kinds of movies). Yet you don't consciously notice his expressions because Scott sells them with the energy and conviction of his performance. He means what he says so urgently that the expressions accompany his dialogue instead of distracting from it. Consider the scene where his character, Gen. Buck Turgidson, is informing the president that it is quite likely a B-52 bomber will be able to fly under Russian radar and deliver its payload even though the entire Soviet air force knows where the plane is headed. \"He can barrel in that baby so low!\" Scott says, with his arms spread wide like wings, and his head shaking in admiration at how good his pilots are--so good one of them is about to bring an end to civilization.\n\nAnother actor, waving his arms around, might look absurd. Scott embodies the body language so completely that it simply plays as drama (and comedy). In another scene, scurrying around the War Room, he slips, falls to a knee, rights himself, and carries on. Kubrick the perfectionist left the unplanned slip in the film, because Scott made it seem convincing, and not an accident.\n\n\"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964) is filled with great comic performances, and just as well, because there's so little else in the movie apart from faces, bodies and words. Kubrick shot it on four principal locations (an office, the perimeter of an Air Force base, the \"War Room,\" and the interior of a B-52 bomber). His special effects are competent but not dazzling (we are obviously looking at model planes over Russia). The War Room, one of the most memorable of movie interiors, was created by Ken Adam out of a circular desk, a ring of lights, some back-projected maps, and darkness. The headquarters of Gen. Jack D. Ripper, the haywire Air Force general, is just a room with some office furniture in it.\n\nYet out of these rudimentary physical props and a brilliant screenplay (which Kubrick and Terry Southern based on a novel by Peter George), Kubrick made what is arguably the best political satire of the century, a film that pulled the rug out from under the Cold War by arguing that if a \"nuclear deterrent\" destroys all life on Earth, it is hard to say exactly what it has deterred.\n\n\"Dr. Strangelove's\" humor is generated by a basic comic principle: People trying to be funny are never as funny as people trying to be serious and failing. The laughs have to seem forced on unwilling characters by the logic of events. A man wearing a funny hat is not funny. But a man who doesn't know he's wearing a funny hat ... ah, now you've got something.\n\nThe characters in \"Dr. Strangelove'' do not know their hats are funny. The film begins with Gen. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) fondling a phallic cigar while launching an unauthorized nuclear strike against Russia. He has become convinced that the commies are poisoning \"the purity and essence of our natural fluids\" by adding fluoride to the water supply. (Younger viewers may not know that in the 1950s this was a widespread belief.) Ripper's nuclear strike, his cigar technique and his concern for his \"precious bodily fluids\" are so entwined that they inspire unmistakable masturbatory associations.\n\nThe only man standing between Ripper and nuclear holocaust is a British liaison, Group Captain Mandrake (Sellers), who listens with disbelief to Rippers' rantings. Meanwhile, Ripper's coded message goes out to airborne B-52s to launch an attack against Russia. A horrified President Muffley (Sellers again) convenes his advisers in the War Room and is informed by Turgidson, bit by reluctant bit, of the enormity of the situation: The bombers are on the way, they cannot be recalled, Gen. Ripper cannot be reached, and so on. Eventually, Muffley calls the Russian premiere to confess everything (\"Dimitri, we have a little problem ... \").\n\nOther major players include the sinister strategist Dr. Strangelove (Sellers a third time), a character whose German accent now evokes Henry Kissinger, although in 1964 nuclear think-tanker Herman Kahn was the likely target. Strangelove's black-gloved right hand is an unruly weapon with a will of its own, springing into Nazi salutes and trying to throttle Strangelove to death. Action in the War Room and on the Air Force base is intercut with the B-52 cockpit, ruled by Major T.J. \"King\" Kong (Slim Pickens); when he's told by his radio man that the order to attack has come through, he tells them, \"No horsin' around on the airplane!\"\n\nMajor Kong was intended to be Sellers' fourth role, but he was uncertain about the cowboy accent. Pickens, a character actor from westerns, was brought in by Kubrick, who reportedly didn't tell him the film was a comedy. Pickens' patriotic speeches to his crew (and his promises of promotion and medals) are counterpoint to the desperate American efforts to recall the flight.\n\nI've always thought the movie ends on an unsure note. After the first nuclear blast, Kubrick cuts back to the War Room, where Strangelove muses that deep mines could be used to shelter survivors, whose descendants could return to the surface in 90 years (Turgidson is intrigued by the 10-to-1 ratio of women to men). Then the film abruptly ends in its famous montage of many mushroom clouds, while Vera Lynn sings \"We'll Meet Again.\"\n\nIt seems to me there should be no more dialogue after the first blast; Strangelove's survival strategy could be moved up to just before Slim Pickens' famous bareback ride to oblivion. I realize there would be a time lapse while Russian missiles responded to the attack, but I think the film would be more effective if the original blast brought an end to all further story developments. (Kubrick originally planned to end the film with a pie fight, and a table laden with pies can be seen in the background of the War Room, but he wisely realized that his purpose was satire, not slapstick.)\n\n\"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) are Kubrick's masterpieces. The two films share a common theme: Man designs machinery that functions with perfect logic to bring about a disastrous outcome. The U.S. nuclear deterrent and the Russian \"doomsday machine\" function exactly as they are intended, and destroy life on earth. The computer HAL 9000 serves the space mission by attacking the astronauts.\n\nStanley Kubrick himself was a perfectionist who went to obsessive lengths in order to get everything in his films to work just right. He owned his own cameras and sound and editing equipment. He often made dozens of takes of the same shot. He was known to telephone projectionists to complain about out-of-focus screenings. Are his two best films a nudge in his own ribs?",

The main highlight of the cast is Peter Sellers, who is unrecognizable between his three roles of Dr. Strangelove, Pres.Muffley & Cap. Mandrake, giving each a distinct performance & look.  Whether it's Dr. Strangelove's eccentric fights with his mechanical arm or Pres. Muffley's hilarious phone call to the Soviet Prime Minister, it is truly the finest work of one of the greatest comedic actors in history.  That's not to say the rest of the cast doesn't shine, particularly George C. Scott's hilarious turn as Gen. Turgidson, who over-the-top acting & brilliant facial expressions manage to steal every scene he's in.  Behind the camera, Stanley Kubrick crafts a hilarious satire that mostly plays it straight, thankfully since the idea of 'deterrence' is so ridiculous if you think about it (as Dr. Strangelove says, \"What is the point of a doomsday device if you don't tell anyone about it?\").  It does apply some classic spoof elements, from character names (one general is named Jack D. Ripper) to arguments over mundane things when the apocalypse is about to happen (a soldier objecting to breaking a Coca-Cola machine because it's private property is prime example).  Overall, one of the funniest movies ever made since it lives up to the title, as you can will only find yourself laughing at the concept of nuclear armageddon.",

Dr. Strangelove is downright hilarious while also making a strong statement about the dangers of nuclear weapons. I love movies like this where most of the cast plays it straight, and allows the great script to provide the comedy. In fact, aside from some physical comedy from Peter Sellers, everyone behaves as if this is a serious drama. The cast is off-the-charts with awesome actors. I could go through and compliment each and every one, but let's just say they are all marvelous. Sellers obviously deserves a little extra credit because he plays 3 different characters with such skill that I never even thought about whether it would be better with separate actors in the roles. Some of the aerial footage looked extremely artificial, probably because of the limited techniques they had available to them at that time, but it's a pretty minor quibble in an excellent film. Perhaps my favorite aspect of Dr. Strangelove is how it constantly offers a ray of hope, as if everything might get fixed. Then, once your hopes are high, it pulls the rug out from under you and a series of mistakes keep things escalating. Perhaps my biggest complaint about this film is that it's not long enough. I know that's crazy, but I was having such a good time that I wanted the fun to continue and there were a few characters who needed a little more screen-time to completely flesh out their part in the story. However, this is a superb film that takes a stand, but also has enough humor to entertain people who don't care at all about that standpoint. Highly recommended!",

And while this movie doesn't have a whole lot of characters, it still has a few that we can find enjoyment in. Peter Sellars is really good in this movie as he takes on the hard job of playing three very different characters in the movie, but out of all of them, I must say that Dr. Strangelove was the weirdest of them and the proud Englisman Lionel Mandrake was the most enjoyable one of them.

Loaded with timeless characters, jokes, and images, the film is equal parts hilarious and frightening. Classic performances abound, the film is perhaps best remembered for Peter Sellers' totally gonzo work as three different characters. But there's a ton more to love. The dialogue is all-time great stuff, the pacing is brilliant, and the camerawork is amazing.\n\nWhen the deranged (and bodily fluid-obsessed) General Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden) orders his 30 or so pilots to attack the Soviet Union with nuclear weapons, all hell breaks loose. The General blockades himself in his office with a British Captain Mandrake (Sellers) and orders the men on his base to kill anyone that tries to get past them. So President Merkin Muffley (Sellers, again), General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott), and the film's titular brilliant-but-mad scientist (Sellers), as well as a few other dozen military and political minds, gather in the war room to discuss how to proceed. On their to-do list: Order a full-on invasion of Ripper's base to extract the abort codes from him, weigh the pros and cons of actually letting the men drop their bombs, and inform the Soviet Premier that the apocalypse is approaching rapidly from 30 different directions. While on the horn with Premier Kisov, the President gets some startling news. The Soviets have just activated their doomsday machine. In order to deter a nuclear attack, this machine will trigger a global nuclear disaster should a device detonate over Soviet soil. So the problem becomes exponentially larger at the exact moment when the men trying to solve it begin losing their minds.\n\nSidney Lumet tackled a similar subject matter in Fail-Safe, but he did so as a deadly serious drama. Only someone as audacious as Kubrick would find humor in the potential end of the world, and he does so through a host of characters who are simply bananas. Scott's Turgidson is maniacal. To him, everyone is a potential commie spy, and everything that's said is a potential weapon for said spies to use against America. The President is a bit of a weasel (and apparently was inspired by Governor Adlai Stevenson). Ripper is pure Sterling Hayden-super-intimidating, but completely out of his mind.\n\nThen, there's Strangelove, who's in another stratosphere of crazy. He's a former Nazi, who loves the idea of a nuclear holocaust. He's supposedly brilliant, but he also has Dr. No hands and no real control over his bodily functions. I have no idea where the idea for this guy came from, but there's a reason he's so memorable: He's a one-of-a-kind individual.\n\nIt's hard to discuss much else about the film without getting into spoilers, but suffice it to say, I absolutely adore Dr. Strangelove. The situations in which these characters find themselves are just spectacular. The war room is crazy, Slim Pickins riding the warhead is awesome, and Peter Sellers, Peter Sellers, Peter Sellers. Yeah, this is a great one.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/dr-strangelove-review/",

I hate stating this, because Stanley Kubrick is my favourite film-maker of all time and this is regarded as one of his greatest works.  However, to me, Kubrick creates art, not simply films.  This film is not art.  I believe that critics' group-think has been good to this film's legacy.  For example, music critics have long raved at how great The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds album is.  Yet, I do not hear it's innovation or superiority over the rest of the Beach Boys discography...and likely they don't either!\n\nThere is so much more to Kubrick's legacy of masterpiece film-making than this silly film that is not that funny or groundbreaking.  Don't believe the hype!",

Dr. Strangelove is an interesting study of the middle man's view of higher politics and in even the most desperate of times, they will be selfish and self-serving.

What few nuclear weapons left after arms negotiations might be used, but the cataclysmic holocaust designed to reduce a population artificially inflated by government policy is inevitable. Similar arms negotiations between the world powers in the 1930's didn't stop WW II, no they created WW II. Most of the world leaders and their puppet spokesmen are champing at the bit for  whole sale violent carnage to start, what is inhibiting their desires is the fear that the limited nuclear exchange considered, or rather advoctaed, by some military leaders will lead to a months long nuclear war that will leave too much of a mess behind for them to satisfy their power lust.\nIt isn't war that Mr Kubrick makes fun of, it is war with nuclear weapons, as evidenced by Dr Strangelove's final speech on the conditions necessary for survival. One saving grace of the film is that it is titled \"..how I\" not how we stopped worrying. When Mr. Kubrick's movie was released, and for decades after, no one was in the least worried about nuclear warfare occurring. So recanting a bit, Mr Kubrick's title is a bit of a lie, since he's more worried that a more limited version of WW III won't occur so he has been instructed to resort to fear mongering to drum up support for the new, nuclear free WW III. Sounds like a line from a Coke commercial.",

Peter Sellers' triple performance as Mandrake, the President, and the titular Dr. Strangelove are so distinct and committed that you forget it's the same man and just see three different people. George C. Scott is also funny as a crazy military general and has some gut-busting lines. The effects are a bit dated and can be considered a legitimate problem with the film but I consider it to be one more comedic layer to the movie with those goofy effects. I will also admit that certain scenes in the aircraft with the insane bomber pilot go on a bit too long, therefore slowing the pace a little. Never the less, those are small complaints, the movie is still exceptionally written and very well realized. The production design is beautiful at times with Kubrick's signature attention to detail, and the movie is just a blast to watch while being perfectly short, sweet, and to the point. Dr. Strangelove is \"PIMP!!!\"",

            "content": "\"Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room.\"\n\nThis is only my third Stanley Kubrick film, but so far it's my favorite. I can't imagine how funny this film must have been when it came out in the mid 60's during the height of the Cold War, because more than 50 years later this black and white comedy continues to resonate in today's modern political world. It's sharp, it's smart, it's dark, but above all it's funny. It seems after so many decades that we haven't learned a thing about the sharp ironies presented here through each character and situation because the story continues to be relatable. The script is hilarious and the delivery from each actor is perfect, with several characters standing out. Peter Sellers does an amazing job playing three very different characters, but I was especially a fan of George C. Scott's portrayal of Gen. Buck. The scenes in the War Room were by far my favorite in the movie, but almost everything worked to perfection in this sharp and tightly written satire. The effects are a bit over the top but I think it simply adds to the overall craziness of the movie. I know I still have a lot of catching up with Kubrick films, but I don't see how his other films will top this one, at least entertaining wise. Satires can become a bit heavy handed after its initial first half, but this film maintains the laughs throughout its entire runtime. I'm surprised that I found this political comedy hilarious considering I'm not into politics at all, but I found it impossible not to watch it with a smile on my face. Is there a better political satire than Dr. Strangelove? I doubt it or at least I haven't come across one yet. What makes this film so relevant is that we are laughing at a nuclear threat in a time when the fear was very eminent.  \n \nIn the opening scenes we are introduced to General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), who is giving his pilots secret orders to bomb the Soviet Union. Jack has gone mad and is overstepping his authority after discovering a loophole which allows him to order the attack without having to ask for permission from the US government. He has cut off all communication with the pilots so no one can stop his insane plan. Jack is convinced the communists are poisoning the world and he must stop them. When the President, Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) is informed of the General's plan he immediately calls his advisors to the War Room in order to try to put an end to Jack's madness. His advisor, General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott), informs the President how Jack was able to overstep his authority and in a hilarious scene through the big board shows the location of every plane as they are approaching the Soviet Union. Against Buck's advice, the President decides to invite Russian Ambassador Alexei de Sadeski (Peter Bull) to the War Room in order to discuss what is happening and to prove he isn't responsible for the attacks. Among the men in the room there is also Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers), a former Nazi scientist who is a specialist when it comes to nuclear weapons. The interactions between these characters and their efforts to stop Jack's plan in order to avoid the world's anihilation becomes the focal point of the film. \n\nPeter Sellers delivers outstanding work here playing the President, Dr. Strangelove, and Lionel Mandrake, who is Jack's right hand man and the only one who thinks he can stop him from executing his plan. He delivers three very distinctive characters and I honestly didn't recognize it was the same actor. George C. Scott is the standout however in his overly dramatic and serious delivery. His character was the one I laughed the most at. The things he says in such a serious tone are absolutely hilarious. I don't know how much of the lines were improvised or how much of it was actually scripted from Peter George's book, Red Alert, but all I can say is that every line was executed perfectly by these actors. This is one of those films that has trascended its time and continues to make audiences laugh around the globe.   \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

Ripper decides to launch an attack to the USSR, thus beginning nuclear warfare. \nLet's go back to 1964. Due to the John F. Kennedy assassination and the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Cold War was at its peak causing paranoia all around the world, so it didn't seem appropriate to make a comedy about it but Kubrick dared to do it and the result was both controversial and masterful. \"Dr Strangelove\" is a film that has everything a masterpiece requires: A well written script, some iconic imagery, clever and hilarious dialog, impeccable acting with the best being the unpredictably funny Peter Sellers in three different and well established characters (it makes you wish Sellers have played more characters), and George C. Scott in one of the most hilarious performances I\u00b4ve seen (even if he hated it); memorable and ironically named characters, it is both hilarious and quite suspenseful (just look at Dr Strangelove himself as the definitive proof), the black comedy is flawless, a fast pace that's all about buildup, numerous themes that are executed with subtlety, and once again Kubrick proves why he gained his legendary status, with his jaw dropping cinematography, perfect use of music, masterful use of lighting, and perfectionism on every little detail. It must be said that like with every Kubrick film, this needs to be seen more than once in order to fully appreciate its greatness. \n\"Dr Strangle or How Learn to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\" is a hilarious, unforgettable and daring black comedy that proves that Kubrick can make anything, despite how controversial the subject matter is. I will say that this is undeniably one of Kubrick\u00b4s best films (undeniably in his top 3). A film that will not harm \"the purity of your precious bodily fluids\".",

I can't help but wonder what it must have been like to see this film within context of the era it was released. \n\nAs the concept of \"A Cold War\" is once again present, this dated film remains full of relevance. Even though it is all told within the confines of the early 1960's -- one can almost imagine this sort of terrifying interplay going on far below the surface of The White House. \n\nGeorge C. Scott is brilliant, but this is Peter Sellers' movie. His is a masterful demonstration of the power of a gifted comedic actor. Each character he plays is distinctively unique and works on multiple levels. \n\nKubrick's style was really starting to emerge here. Gilbert Taylor yet again shows us his versatility as a Cinematographer. He captures the sets, reactions and vibe in perfect mastery to the actors involved.\n\nThis film was briefly available from Sony on Blu-Ray but it was a fairly sloppy transfer.

            "content": "This political satire is more than anyone can expect. Two global army powers in a nuclear conflict, and \"Dr.Strangelove\" show the most tense side, with a lot of black humor.\n\nStanley Kubrick directed, produced and wrote this masterpiece in the smartest way possible, and everything resulted well, because every scene, every dialogue and every important moment are perfect. Despite the last mentioned the rythm sometimes is a few uneven and boring, so the picture lost a little its sense.\n\nThe film is set during the cold war and tells the story of how a group of planes of the United States Air Force under the orders of General Jack D. Ripper pretend to bomb the Soviet Union, when the American President Merkin Muffley is informed about the mission he wants to communicate with the pilots so that they should abort the mission, but Ripper cut the communications and close the military base, leaving him and Captain Lionel Mandrake inside.\n\nThe picture take place in three main locations: the B-52 with a bombom inside and four American soldiers, the General Ripper's office and the \"War Room\" with the big board. It feels like there were a few places to that the protagonists developed but agains that it's easier to follow the plot.\n\nThe performances are excellent like in every Kubrick's film; Peter Sellers played three wonderful roles on screen, the British captain Lionel Mandrake, the president Merkin Muffley and the ex-Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove. George C. Scott also made an exceptional performance like the jingoist general Buck Turgidson. It's important to say that absolutely all the actors are pretty convincing in their roles.\n\nThe cinematography of Gilbert Taylor is just ok, with good framings and nothing of hand-camera the texture of the image sometimes fails, however the camera focuses properly in general shots, without annoying approaches. The edition of Anthony Harvey is very good, the scenes of the airplane with the onces of the War Room are interspersed in a very nice way and easy to see for the viewer.\n\nThis movie is a classic with a lot of immortal quotes in cinema history like \"Gentleman you can't fight here! this  is the War Room!\" or \"Mein Fuhrer... I can walk!\", so my personal advise is that you sit down for 94 minutes, stop worrying and love the bomb!",

            "content": "Out of one of the most tense times in U.S. history came one of the more crude and witty satires on the U.S. approach and policies. The film was a spoof of the entire American special forces, and their protocols. Dr. Strangelove was a witty satire of the paranoia towards communism, the overly complex emergency protocols, and the U.S. special forces leadership. It was also most likely a film that would predict the future culture of America. In the mid 1960's, when Dr. Strangelove came out, respect for the government was paramount to the masses, this trust would be violated just a few years later with the war of Vietnam. Looking at that maybe it's best to say Dr. Strangelove was slightly ahead of it's time, and maybe it even helped shape the future cultures opinions. Either way the irreverence that Dr. Strangelove showed towards the U.S. politicians and special forces was at the time, controversial, mostly because the most accepted idea was that these people and institutions were off limits. The film was brimming with irony, most likely symbolizing that Kubrick felt the cold war, and paranoia had an ironic air to it. The film seems to reinforce that Kubrick thought the whole situation was ridiculous, and the irony of the hysteria wasn't lost on Kubrick either. There are examples of this littered throughout the film, and Kubrick obviously found something funny about it all, it's easy to look back and laugh, but at the time this film was bold, because it was as scary as it was funny to those watching it. As was mentioned earlier the film's cornerstone is the ironic humor, for example the ironic scoring. Kubrick was a master of using music to further his movie, especially in 2001: A Space Odyssey, but in this instance the music was an extension of Kubrick's opinions. Used brilliantly the music had a peaceful scariness, as soft melodic music plays over bomb carriers flying through the sky. Another element Kubrick wouldn't shy away from, especially with irony, was the overly masculine posturing of both countries. Irony was also used to satirize the U.S. leadership, often showing the irony of the special forces. Good examples of this are the poster reading \"Peace is our Profession\", or Slim Picken's talking about promotions as they unknowingly go rogue, or the most famous quote of the film \"Gentlemen you can't fight here, this is the war room.\" All of these are great examples of the overly militarized society that we were living in, something Kubrick must have hated. Coming at a time of change for the country, and possibly helping that change happen Kubrick boldly satirized one of the most respected organizations in the United States with reckless abandon. However, maybe in doing so gave the country exactly what it needed, a vehicle to laugh and poke fun at how ridiculous the countries were acting. Considering the opinions of culture towards the military, and other satirized organizations, it seems obvious that Dr. Strangelove was drastically ahead of it's time.",

Everything, though, is memorable in this unique event in the history of American cinema. Gentlemen, you can't fight in here; this is the war room!",

But a man who doesn't know he's wearing a funny hat ... ah, now you've got something. \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) are Kubrick's masterpieces.

The U.S. nuclear deterrent and the Russian \"doomsday machine\" function exactly as they are intended, and destroy life on earth. The computer HAL 9000 serves the space mission by attacking the astronauts. Stanley Kubrick himself was a perfectionist who went to obsessive lengths in order to get everything in his films to work just right. He owned his own cameras and sound and editing equipment. He often made dozens of takes of the same shot. He was known to telephone projectionists to complain about out-of-focus screenings. Are his two best films a nudge in his own ribs?",

Yet, in more recent years, this idea of nuclear war is starting to become a reality. But what could happen if this idea was parodied? Enter the 1964 comedy \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\" from director Stanley Kubrick. Long title aside, this movie offers a very comical outlook by taking a very serious subject matter, and poking fun at it. \"Dr. Strangelove\" is full of dark humor that is still an amazing experience and worth watching to see how something like this would have been made in today's modern age of political struggle.\n\nThe plot is just one crazy moment after another. An army commander goes mad over the fact that the Russians (then called the Soviets) are infiltrating our preciously bodily fluids. So, what does he do? Start a nuclear war, of course! Then, a B-52 plane gets the message, and is ordered to attack Russia, while carrying two nuclear missiles. But the plane's main target holds a doomsday machine, which will cause enough radiation that will encircle the Earth for over 100 years. The president and his staff members try to stop this attack from happening. And the only person that can offer the most logic in the room is a former Nazi.\n\n\"Dr. Strangelove\" is a dark political comedy full of creativity. Even though the movie is loosely based on a book, the story is crazy enough to be treated as a serious drama. Yet it pokes fun at the stupidity of the human race and their approach to scientific advancements. The patriotic general (George C. Scott) trying to creative the worst resources available, the cowboy riding a missile to his demise, one cannot help but crack a smile at the stupidity of these characters. Everything else that goes on in the movie is perfect. Stanley Kubrick's direction is superb as usual, giving the film more of a visual experience than anything else. The acting is incredible, even from our main leads of Scott and Peter Sellers, who, by the way, plays three roles, including the title character. The movie is beautifully shot in black and white, making the cinematography really stand out. Even the sets, including the infamous \"war room\", are designed so spectacularly that one has to wonder how everything was accomplished. With this film, it feels like there is nothing negative to say about it at all.\n\nWell, the concept of nuclear war, while still relevant today, has pretty much died down when trying to make a comedy about the subject in question.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\" is a fantastic comedy from a time when nuclear war actually seemed threatening. Now, it's pushed off to the side and nobody really cares for it anymore. Thankfully, we have this movie to lighten our spirits.",

The technology of the Hydrogen bomb.\nWhen Soviet Union and the United States were in the midst of competition to achieve total global super power, Stanley Kubrick combined all these elements into a downright hilarious laugh riot.\nThe most serious situations can be well converted into a satire. Kubrick provides life to this idea as the Russians in a desperate attempt to ward of enemy strikes after losing the space race, the arms competition and the peace competition, creates the Doomsday Machine which shall annihilate life on earth if a nuclear attack is made on the Soviet soil. A delusional colonel's false theories of accusation against the Russians, which is actually a cause of his own dysfunction, leads to supposed string of impending nuclear attacks on the Soviet Union by the United States. The President and his pentagon honchos are helpless as the presidents faulty policy has given the colonel an upper hand as the launched bombers cannot be called back. The crisis and frustrated war room drama turns into carnival of black comedy.  \nDr. Strangelove surely stands superior to every comedy movie till date. While providing laughs, at the same time Kubrick has also brought in elements of social morality - the power of capitalism over the government, faulty policies from political bigshots, delusion over self dysfunction. Dr. Strangelove also explores how an attempt in the development of a foolproof system cannot be achieved as certain minor errors can drastically threaten the national security.\nStanley Kubrick, with a keen eye on profound projections of literature has once again adapted them with his stamp of brilliance. \nPeter Sellers takes the reigns of three equally hilarious roles as the American President Merkin Muffley, Captain Lionel Mandrake of the British RAF and the ex-Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove with his superb comic performance. \n\nKubrick's best work till date and a classic which stands firm rooted in the history of film making.",

It is set at the height of the cold war, Where america has B-52 bombers flying close by Russia as a strategy to help prevent/retaliate nuclear war. One day Mad man Jack. D. Ripper, loses his marbles and deecides to take matters into his own hands, issuing an order for the planes to strike primary and secondry targets without the permission of the president, this of course leading to a culmination of continually spiraling events which could lead to a plot called the doomsday device created by the russians could destroy all life on planet earth if the nukes are not stopped. It is, without a doubt dark, satirical, comedy genius at its finest and who better to lead the film itself in 3 major roles, than Peter Sellers. Sellers almost steals the entire show, had it not been for some storming supporting performances by the rest of the cast. Visually you can still see Kubrick trying to find his footing, but the images he creates are still wonderful, especially the iconic war room and the bed room of a war chief whos having a relationship with his secretary. Its of its time for sure, however the themes and issues can still be relatable and funny even more so in this day an age. Whacky, pitch black and full of quirks, this is a film that just keeps on delivering to the end.",

Kubrick's ear for comedy proves as accurate as his eye for cinematography, with Dr. Strangelove providing laugh-out-loud situations and performances in a picture still as funny today as it ever was - let alone (at its heart) ultimately as frightening in its possibilities.",

This black and white, satirical giant is a monument to both Kubrick's attention to visual detail as it is to the undeniable quality of the performances that he was able to reap from his actors. The dark and tense backdrop of this gigantic cold war blunder is effective, and yet despite its urgency and intensity, the plethora of comedic elements that are abundant throughout the film tend to outshine the darker reality of the events that are taking place in each scene, which makes the film work even better as a black comedy for the ages. The characters, particularly those played by Peter Sellers and George C. Scott are intoxicating in their energy and delivery. Dr.Strangelove is both hilarious, and scathingly intelligent in its depiction of international diplomacy and of the inevitability of man to error, and in this case, error over and over and over.",

            "content": "The 1950's were a time of paranoia. It was the decade when the communist threat loomed over every American.  It was a time of black listing and finger pointing. To make matters worse, Americans lived in constant fear of a possible nuclear holocaust. People futilely built fallout shelters in their backyards and school children learned the useless duck and cover technique.  Out of this paranoia came films like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Red Planet Mars. These films reflected the palpable fears that pervaded American society.  They dealt with the issues of invasion and the possibility of destruction of life with a serious tone and reinforced the distress that the country faced. When Dr. Strangelove came along in 1964 the threats of communist invasion and nuclear war were still very real, but audiences were growing weary of the same message delivered in the same solemn style. In the film the military and political leaders of our country are made to look like buffoons. The threat of total, global destruction does not come in the form of a foreign invader or communist plot but from the very people sworn to defend against such things. Sterling Hayden's character General Jack D. Ripper is the embodiment of the cold war fears of the 1950's. He rants throughout the film about the communist plot to poison his \"essence\" through the fluoridation of water. The character's deadpan delivery of his paranoid theories serves as a critique of people like Senator Joseph McCarthy. Ripper chomps on his phallic cigar, a symbol to represent the male dominated military, as he calmly orders a massive preemptive strike against Russia. The audience cannot help but laugh at such an asinine character and at the same time shiver at the eerily accurate satire. George C. Scott's character General Buck Turgidson is also comically obtuse. When asked if he thinks that the bomber that slipped by the Russian attack will be able to deliver its payload he proudly confirms, \"...he can barrel that baby in so low...\" He says this with a smile on his face and his arms spread wide emulating the plane. Again, we laugh at one of the ridiculous idiots that populate the film. At the same time we recoil at the thought of a General happy that his men can efficiently deliver the bomb that will end the world. Also laughable but frightening is how pleased he seems about the \"...no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops.\"\nDr. Strangelove was a landmark political satire that appealed to those who were fed up with the outmoded thinking of the previous decade. It captured the new attitude of the younger generation who would go on to protest the war in Vietnam and demand change. The film rejects the anxieties of the previous generation and does so in a hip fashion that would become synonymous with the new Hollywood.",

My hypothesis is that a comedy should first start as a drama. Then you look for moments where there could be outside-perspective humour, without destructing any of the drama within the context of the story. However Dr. Strangelove was conceived and developed, the 1964 Stanley Kubrick-directed film flawlessly sets itself up as a harrowing, apocalyptic Cold War thriller, only to lighten up by deforming into a relentlessly funny take on the circumstances. You need not be politically fluent or active to understand the satire, or plain silliness, of the story in its smaller elements. The \"Peace is Our Profession\" signs present in a speech about destroying the commies were the first indicator I saw that this was tongue-in-cheek. Matters get much darker, thus more hilarious, after Plan R (bombing the hell out of Soviet Russia) is established. Our cast includes Peter Sellers as a mediator-like U.S. president, Peter Sellers as a loyal, but rational executive military officer, Peter Sellers as the ex-Nazi weapons expert Dr. Strangelove, George C. Scott as a commie-fearing military ambassador, and Sterling Hayden as the similarly war-hungry general responsible for the entire conflict. The shockingly ridiculous script, as greatly written as it is, is brought to its highest peak on screen, grouped with the actors' fiery-in-their-dedication performances, Kubrick's unique specificity of the spatial relationship between action and the camera, and the occasional ironically-uplifting score.",

J. Kong and Peter Bull as Sovjet ambassador Alexei. This is a constantly comical endeavor, but with a serious political message, it portrays fictional top politicians, scientists and military officers of the US in childish arguments over an absurd situation brought on by their own paranoid and aggressive political thinking.

            "content": "Dr. Strangelove is what is often considered the Godfather of satires and black comedies, and although this isn't Kubrick's masterpiece in my opinion, it's hard to deny how much fun I had with this one. What's probably the riskiest, boldest thing about this film is the fact that Kubrick actually released this during the Cold War. Considering this film is a black war comedy satirizing our decisions during the war, and it was a statement on what was seen at the time as a deadly threat, it must have been the subject of controversy at the time, but it must've also shined light on how ironic and ridiculous the war really was. Dr. Strangelove is offbeat and weird in one of the best ways possible, although lots of the humor is subtle and you may have to \"read between the lines\" in order to really understand the significance of the humor and find it to be a thought-provoking film. That being said, Dr. Strangelove is still absurd and ridiculous enough to be a crazily hilarious dark humor on its own. I must admit that I still can't get myself to love this film, and although I can't get myself to call it \"overrated\" either, I feel like some of the humor didn't quite work for me and went over my head. Even then, Dr. Strangelove still deserves its reputation as a classic, intelligent war film. \n\nDr. Strangelove concerns the utterly bonkers General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) who decides to issue his planes on \"Plan R\", instructing the aircrafts to commence a nuclear war on the Soviet Union. While the planes are heading towards the Soviet Union, the ineffective yet well-intentioned president (Peter Sellers) has a discussion with his other men as well as a Russian ambassador (Peter Bull) in the Pentagon's War Room, and they learn that a \"doomsday device\" in the Soviet Union will detonate should any nuclear attack strike the country. What's interesting was the fact that the story was actually intended to be a serious Cold War thriller based off of the novel known as \"Red Alert\", but Kubrick felt like the idea would work better as a flat-out black comedy. What's even more interesting is the fact that audiences laughed at Kubrick's exposing of their own fear, a nuclear threat, despite the fact that the scenario of a nuclear strike could happen any second during the time. Other roles include General Buck (George C. Scott), Major T.J Kong (Slim Pickens), and Colonel \"Bat\" Guano (Keenan Wynn) as well as two other roles by Peter Sellers, including Lionel Mandrake, a British officer, and (of course), the ex-Nazi Dr. Strangelove. \n\nYes, you heard that right- Peter Sellers plays a total of three roles in this movie, and all of them are top-notch. What I found to be a little disappointing was the fact that Dr. Strangelove himself only had a screen time of about ten minutes, yet he sticks in memory well because of his silly accent and slapstick. I feel like most of the laughs really come from the more deadpan scenes. Apart from his role of Dr. Strangelove, he also plays the president, and what I found to be quite fascinating was the fact that at times, both the president and Strangelove were having a conversation with each other in the War Room. However, since there can't be two Peter Sellers, the filmmakers used a quite clever way in order to make the two characters played by one actor have a discussion. The roles played by Peter are very diverse and comparing the three, it's near-impossible to know that they're all played by the same person at first glance. My favorite role by him, other than Dr. Strangelove, was the bumbling role of officer Lionel Mandrake, and his conversations with Sterling Hayden's General Jack D. Ripper were hysterical. Practically every role has their moments of great.\n\nOne problem I had with the movie was the fact that flight sequences involving Major T.J. Kong and the planes heading towards the Soviet Union played in between the War Room sequences, and I was a little annoyed by the unnecessary flight details. I was a little frustrated at the start because I really didn't find myself loving the experience until the War Room was introduced. Some of the jokes really didn't work for me and went over my head, and although I still laughed quite a bit throughout the movie, many people may not see the funny side of nuclear annihilation. These few, but glaring flaws were clearly made up by the enduring and amazingly written script, with some of the best lines I've heard from a war movie. A few lines that come to mind are \"Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room\" and \"Mein Fuhrer! I can walk!\". The writing is endlessly quotable and not only is it funny, but it's actually quite thought provoking. The script exposes the weaknesses of the safeguards of a nuclear war, and considering it was released only a year before the Cuban Missile Crisis, the movie must've been very controversial, building up not only lots of fear but odd laughter for audiences.\n\nDr. Strangelove is an unbelievably brave take on the Cold War that is oddly stupidly and smartly humorous at the same time, using silly slapstick in order to surprisingly bring up extremely good points about the Cold War. It's a certainly dark film, and not all the humor will appeal to every audience, but if you can appreciate and play along with it you're more than likely going to have fun with this movie. As I said, even though I can't say this movie is \"overrated\", I can't quite get myself to love it at the same level as everyone else, but it's certainly an enduring war film. Who knew that Kubrick could tackle dark humor so well? Not only is this film hysterical and absurd, but it's also well-researched, thought-provoking, and very smart when it comes to raising a devastating question. The ending is also incredibly pessimistic and ironic. Dr. Strangelove as a whole is not one of the best Kubrick films, but it's still purely genius and although it has its fair share of flaws, the tightly-written, darkly-funny script and the fantastic acting more than make up for them. Dr. Strangelove has clearly stood the test of time, and it's still amusing even by today's standards.",

            "content": "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is a black comedy that satirizes the Cold War scare. Directed and co-written by Stanley Kubrick, Kubrick wrote a fictional story that takes place during the Cold War when the world is on the brink of nuclear annihilation (and ends up being so). There are three major Cold War ideologies that Kubrick mocks in the film Dr. Strangelove. These ideologies are mutually assured destruction, crackpot realism, and the Red Scare. \n      \n      The biggest ideology that Kubrick satirizes was the concept of mutually assured destruction. The idea is that two sides with nuclear weapons have the potential to completely annihilate each other and thus bringing the world to an end if one spark were to ignite. In other words, if one side was to attack another nation with nuclear weapons, it was inevitable that that other nation would retaliate. \n      \n      There are a few scenes or objects in Dr. Strangelove that satirize the idea of mutually assured destruction. The first to occur is when General Jack Ripper initiates Plan R, which orders his B-52s to drop atomic bombs on the Soviet Union. This action leaves us with the anticipation of whether the planes can be stopped or if they can drop the bombs and trigger the destruction of the earth. Because the film ends with a B-52 dropping the bomb and the end result of the world being completely blown up, the planes' order represents the idea of mutually assured destruction. The order represents the inevitability of  this idea because once the attack/order is made, it is inevitable for a counter-attack to occur and will quickly lead to world destruction. Another scene that satirizes mutually assured destruction is when Dr. Strangelove explains the function of the doomsday machine. Dr. Strangelove describes the doomsday machine as a weapon that is triggered automatically through a complex computer system. It is impossible to un-trigger and it also rules out human meddling by decision making. The doomsday machine is another example of mutually assured destruction because once the American attack was made, it results in the inevitability of the doomsday machine to trigger. The machine reflects the human thought process when it comes to nuclear war. When Dr. Strangelove says that it rules out human meddling by decision making, it is a reflection of how humans also do this because they rule out the future of mankind just for the sake of attacking back. Also, the idea of the impossibility of the machine to be un-triggered also reveals that once human attacks are made, there is no stopping of the nuclear war. \n      \n      Another ideology that is mocked was crackpot realism. Crackpot realism was the idea that the U.S.'s best shot at survival during the Cold War was preemptive strikes. Some other principles in crackpot realism was that the U.S. couldn't chance being attacked by the Soviet Union first, there was a huge missile gap that was in favor of the U.S. and it should be taken advantage of, and the U.S. would win with only a few million casualties. Ultimately, crackpot realism was the justification of the bomb. This ideology is attributed to Curtis LeMay, a U.S. Air Force general, who believed in these principles. He believed that this was how the U.S. should have handled its situation with the Soviet Union. This sounds very much like the character General Buck Turgidson in Dr. Strangelove. They both were U.S. generals and they share the principles of crackpot realism. In one scene in the War Room, Turgidson gives a piece of his mind to President Merkin Muffley when it comes to what Muffley should do. Tugidson recommends that the President order all-out coordinated attacks against the Soviet Union's airfields and military, \"catching 'em with their pants down.\" He also mentions that they could destroy 90% of the Soviet's nuclear capabilities. He tries to convince the President that there is nothing to worry about because the U.S. has a huge advantage over the Soviet Union in terms of how many nukes the U.S. has. Following that, he tries to justify the mass murders by comparing the 150 million Soviet deaths to the no more than 10-20 million American casualties; \"Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed.\" It's safe to say that General Buck Turgidson matches the characteristics of General Curtis LeMay and crackpot realism.\n      \n      The final major Cold War ideology that is satirized in Dr. Strangelove was the Red Scare in the 1950s. The Red Scare was basically the fear of communism in the United States. It primarily focused on foreign communists infiltrating the U.S. government. General Jack Ripper's theory of communist infiltration correlates with the Red Scare. Ripper's theory is that commies are infiltrating and tainting our \"precious bodily fluids\" without us knowing it. He claims that the most dangerous commie plot was fluoridation, which he describes as the process of commies tainting our water, juice, and other liquids with foreign substances. It is because of his wild theory that results in him ordering Plan R. His theory ultimately makes him go crazy. Part of this may be because of what was going on in the world when he discovered his theory in 1946 (\"during the physical act of love.\") In 1946, communist tension was getting tight around the world; the Chinese Civil War was going on at that time. Also, it could be because of everything that had happened since then. For example, the events of the success of Joe 1 in 1949, the rise of communist China in 1950, the containment policy in North Korea, and McCarthyism all could have attributed to Ripper's paranoia. Although, the film does not explain the effects of this \"fluoridation,\" we can interpret Ripper's paranoia as a parallel to the Red Scare phenomenon.\n\n      If one can find the satirical jokes/situations in Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, he or she would certainly hail it as a brilliant film. It implements a black humor style of film to satirize the nuclear scare. Genius! Dr. Strangelove will always be one of the greatest satires of all time.",

All I can say is I'm truly amazed that such a simple story could be so memorable and amazing to watch every time.  Stanley Kubrick, to me at least, is one of the greatest directors of all time, and Dr. Strangelove proves that in the biggest way possible.  In only a hour and a half Kubrick delivers a masterpiece and film that defines the Cold War and American cinema.  Dr. Strangelove's story is simplistic, yet full of energy, emotion, and enjoyment.  Following primarily three arcs that work extremely well together and are connected perfectly,  Kubrick spares no time telling the story and putting dark comedy that works on a situation that at the time, and even today, was very serious. \n\nOn the subject of acting, Strangelove hits a grand slam. No matter how big or small there role each actor or actress delivers a great performance.  However, all of them fail in comparison to Peter Sellers.  Sellers plays three roles here, all of which are easily the most memorable.  Playing both a RAF group captain, the president, and Dr. Strangelove himself, his performance is easily the most memorable; especially as Strangelove.  \n\nThe writing from Kubrick, Southern, and George is simply nothing short of extraordinary.  The dialogue produced is easily magnificent and believable for each character and situation.  The same can also be said for Kubrick's direction; marvelous.  The reason why Strangelove worked so well is that Kubrick put his all into it and produced one of the greatest satires of all time.\n\nDr. Strangelove Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is amazing simply because it makes a relatively simple story full of energy and makes it work so well to the point it becomes one of the greatest films produced.  Whether you like Kubrick, Cold War era films, or film in general, Dr. Strangelove will leave a lasting memory of perfection.",

Kubrick uses the ridiculousness of the characters to highlight the absurdity of war but you never get the impression that what is occuring is so far off the mark that it couldn't actually happen. Sellers is brilliant in his three roles and actually plays it straight for two of them (Mandrake and The President) which makes his performances all the more powerful. The film actually flags a bit when he's not involved and it's a shame that he never got to play Major Kong too as the scenes in the bomber, whilst realistic, are a little dull. Kubrick's decision to cut the custard pie fight at the end may have been wise in order to keep the cutting edge of the film but it means that the whole thing feels a little unfinished. Maybe, however, that is the point and the audience is left to feel the consequences. It's not the most 'immediate' Kubrick film I've seen and I think I'll have to see it again to fully appreciate it but there's no doubting its impact.",

            "content": "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb- 9.5/10\r\n\r\n'' It Should be noted that none of the characters portrayed in this movie are meant to represent any real persons living or dead'' - These are the starting ''warning'' quotes of Dr Strangelove, but after witnessing a haunting  and thought-provoking  movie such as Dr Strangelove filled with some really eccentric but almost realistic  characters , you can't help but wonder whether these quotes are completely true or not. Dr Strangelove is haunting, gripping, mind-boggling right from the starting sequences and benefits from a really multi-talented star-cast superbly portraying some really eccentric and indifferent characters which are quite mind-boggling too, a really controversial  and hard-hitting story which is quite gripping and makes you wonder whether the movie is  really based on  fiction or facts and which benefits from really eccentric characters and some cheeky Dark Humour, Dr Strangelove is a movie which stays with you for many a long time after watching it and makes you continuously wonder about it and is presented perfectly by the astounding Stanley Kubrick who makes yet another controversial and mind-boggling movie, this time  about the dark-side of War and what the desperation and greediness of people surrounding this war can do, he makes another real gem in Dr Stangelove which is quite easily one of the most unique and perfect movies drama-war movies shown about how the effects of it can get to people.\r\n\r\nThe Story which is based on the novel ''Red Alert'' written by Peter George is revolving around the time of the Cold War, and it starts by showing an insane and sadistic Brig. Gen. Jack Ripper ( Sterling Hayden)  who tries to start a nuclear holocaust by ordering his air-force troops to go and bomb U.S.A's rivals and in Jack's opinion communist rivals Russia, and after finding out about this insane act a room( called the War Room) full of politicians and other army generals  try to stop that air force and call them back as soon as possible. But that is'nt possible as Gen. Jack has locked himself in a room with Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake( Peter Sellers) and is determined on not giving up the code to call the air-force back and makes it difficult for the officials to stop this preposterous act. But the President of the United States( Peter Sellers Again) tries to make peace with the Russian President and tells him to gun down the air-force sent to destroy them, but after being happy that everything will be alright, he discovers  about this world-destroying bomb made by the Russian Intelligence which is automatic and will go off if the nuclear bombs strike Russia, and he  along with his co-team of another mad Gen. Buck Turgidson, Russian Ambassador( Peter Bulll) and a Dr Strangelove( AND its Sellers again) are now absolutely madly trying to somehow stop this complete world-threatening disaster from happening.\r\n\r\nNow I've seen many a movie where there are many influencial and attention-demanding characters but there are so many of them in this movie that it's almost impossible to look from one to another. Dr Strangelove does'nt have a lead-hero of sorts most simply because it's not that kind-of a movie, but one of the most unique and astounding parts of this movie is that Peter Sellers has 3 different roles in the same movie! He comes into the fray right at the start of the film as the country-devotee, hyper-excited and full of tension Group Capt Lionel Mandrake who after realizing what a terrible mistake he had done, tries to make things right by demanding the code which could call of the air-force but gets himself locked in the same room as the insane Gen.Jack Ripper and things get really tensed and difficult for him then. The 2nd character he portrays is the tensed and frantic President of the U.S.A who is extremely tensed about the insane thing done by Jack Ripper and tries to keep calm and somehow call of this air-force whose acts could lead to world-destruction. The final character is the mysterious and eccentric Dr Strangelove who is the constructor of most weapons of the U.S.A and he helps the President in dealing with the situation.  Now first of all its quite unbelievable for one man to portray 3 characters in the SAME movie, and Sellers has to change his acting, his outlook and his voice for all these 3 characters and does it so well that sometimes it's difficult to figure out that it's the same guy portraying 3 completely different men whom each have a personality of there own, so full credits to Sellers for perfectly portraying these 3 difficult characters ever so well. It would be a bit disrespectful to call the remaining cast as ''supportive'' because some of them have done as good as Sellers, specially starting with George C.Scott who portrays the loud-mouth, eccentric and country-loving General Buck Turgidson and he portrays this indifferent and eccentric character ever so perfectly with the superbly timed dialogues and great face-expression with tinges of dark humour, I really loved his acting and his character is another of many-a characters in this movie which will be remembered for a long time! Sterling Hayden also did a sublime job as the insane and sadistic Brig. Gen Jack Ripper( name suits the character perfectly) who wants to watch the world burn and his acting with a cigar on his mouth through-out the movie with his same expression and rebellious and out-spoken manner was extremely well-portrayed and his sequences with Sellers are quite astounding and they both do so well that it's impossible to concentrate on one person. Now All these characters are some of the most unique, eccentric and indifferent characters I've ever seen in movies and as many of them are mainly based on Army official/politicians, you can't help but wonder the realistic nature in them and also wonder whether they're were anyone such as them during the gruesome wars. All in all the ensemble cast have done a magnificent job which is quite certain in a Kubrick movie and he again shows his immense talent by choosing a considerably inexperienced cast apart from a few and has made all of them portray their characters to the fullest.\r\n\r\nStanley Kubrick is reknown to make controversial movies and he really did'nt care of what people think of him or his movies as well. He made many of his movies on social-evil and the evil in our society which are ignored by the general mass and wants to put to light some controversial stories and characters which other director's/ filmmakers would'nt dare to even try to portray. He Is hated by some and beloved by many for that kind of attitude and his tremendous film-making skills are again shown in another unique and thought-provoking drama-war movie in Dr Strangelove. He has used his dark humour in the movie quite cheekily which can be understood if one watches it really carefully and although they are funny, it almost leaves you a bit ashamed at laughing at the humour. Now As I mentioned above, his usage of inexperienced and relatively un-known actors are again shown superbly in this movie as each and every one of the cast has done a splendid job in portraying each roles, and most of the characters are really difficult to portray because of their unique and indifferent manner, and credit to Kubrick for making his actors act these characters so very wonderfully, but his usage of Peter Sellers in 3 different roles is absolutely outstanding in which the way he perfectly used him to perfectly portray 3 absolutely different characters ever so well .  Now this story which he has chosen to make a movie from is also controversial and is quite bold of him to make this movie, as well as direct it and write the screen-play for it as well. The Story does'nt have any action sequence or sort of things like that but that enthralling atmosphere of what's going to happen to those bombs are ever so gripping and absorbs you into the movie. The Movie is'nt dragged at any point either and is quite short and built up very well,  superbly presented and explained, and it's also a little difficult to completely understand in the first viewing because of this fast-paced manner. I can now see why Kubrick is this popular and beloved by many film lovers, he makes his  movies with such ease and grace by taking active part in every department of the film, and in turns makes movies which are beloved by mostly all audiences with inner-meanings which keep you wondering for a long time after watching it. Dr Strangelove is another one of the all time best war based drama movies which is presented so easily, without any war scenes or nothing of that sort but only a room filled with some men, but only with that Kubrick has earned my love for him and his movies and is quite easily one of my all-time favourite directors.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow The Screen-play which is written by the multi-talented Kubrick himself has some really cheeky and superbly written conversations presented in a movie and the dialogues specially delivered from Sellers, Hayden and Scott are quite eccentric and out- of the ordinary but these dialogues by these characters really make you wonder about whether all of the movie is fiction or not. The Movie Might be in black and white but that does'nt deny the really great and convincing Cinematography in the movie and cinematographer Gilbert Taylor has done a really great job with the tricky cinematography in the movie. The Art Direction and Costume Design in the movie are top class in the movie, especially the costume design of Peter Sellers in the different roles really came to my attention and the art Direction and costume design team also deserve their credits for such lovely work as well.\r\n\r\nThe Music is quite exemplary as the background score in the tensed and thrilling sequences are really well delivered with the beating of the drums and music which really compliment well with any kind-of  war movie of that kind and music director Laurie Johnson also deserves a lot of applause for delivering such fitting and excellent background music which never tend to disappoint one in any Kubrick Movie.\r\n\r\nDr Strangelove may be controversial in many ways but even with a   controversial manner, it still amazes me with its thought-provoking and haunting background and although it is fully based on fiction, at the end you really wonder if there was something like the things shown in the movie in the real world, and I think Dr Strangelove should be seen by a-many because it is enthralling, gripping and really thought-provoking manner  with some sublime acting and unique characters and Kubrick has made another gem in his collection of movies which will be remembered for a long long time and Dr Strangelove is one of the best war-drama movies of all time with an inner meaning which leaves you wondering.",

Now, US \"President Merkin Muffley\" (Peter Sellers) has to try to recall the bombers as he learns that the Soviets have a \"Doomsday Machine\" which will destroy all life on the surface of the Earth that, as a safeguard, cannot be turned off. \r\n\r\nIf you ask me, this movie is not very funny. I probably chuckled at a couple of jokes, but that was it. \r\n\r\nOne thing that makes this movie worth seeing is the cinematography. There are very unique camera angles that directors of today would probably not even think of. This is one of the nicely shot movies I have seen. Even the use of shadow in some scenes were interesting. \r\n\r\nIt might be the because of the technology available at the time of the production of this film, but the special effects were not that great. It was pretty obvious that they used an early version of green screen. It was also obvious that at least one scene taking place in the cockpit that the view seen through the windshields was actually on a screen. \r\n\r\nThere are also some good performances from the main cast, especially from George C. Scott and, in three different roles, Peter Sellers. Out of all the performances, Sellers is the one to see in all three roles he plays, which includes the title character. Thanks to makeup, it helped him establish three drastically different characters. At one point, when one of his characters first appears, I didn't even realize it was him. \r\n\r\nYes, this is a classic, but as all black comedies are, this movie is not for everybody. It is still worth seeing, but I would not put it in your Top 10 \"Must See\" List. I would suggest seeing it on television, either on a cable movie channel or on On Demand.",

Under the cold war backdrop, a rogue nuclear attack to Soviet Union commenced by a fervid anti-communist USA general, which would (irrevocably) launch a doomsday machine (a Soviet Union's ultimate self-destructive nuclear contraption), and would annihilate all the human beings on the earth. It may sounds ridiculous and far-fetched by the mass, Kubrick's masterful endeavor has overcome the detached accessibility of the warfare lingoes and the exclusivity of the decision-makers' political impasse to implement a stranger-than-fiction satire which grants a considerable closeness to its audience with ease.  \n\nRunning within 100 minutes, the film slickly unreels its storyline with great force of dark humor which imbues parodic and even cartoonish idiosyncrasies to the permeating machismo in the air.  Peter Sellers' three-faceted versatility, George C. Scott's Communism-slamming extravaganza and Sterling Hayden's trigger-happy paranoia plus Slim Pickens' cowboy hat, the ensemble cast owns their respective frantic glory within a compacted steak of time, umpteen gags and mockeries can be savored ad infinitum, Sellers'British accent (as Group Captain) when confronting Sterling's General Rippers is unimpeachably spontaneous, Keenan Wynn's coca-cola joke is pertinently deadpan serious and Sterling's conspiracy theory about water fluoridation and the fearful deprivation of life essence during a sexual intercourse (the man just cannot face his natural aging mechanism of the body) are plainly golden ideas, outlandish but vividly rib-tickling, and astringently self-reflective.\n\nKubrick's trademark set design which would prevail in his later color features has not  fully exploited this black-and-white war farce, and the (not-too-obvious) misogyny and chauvinism overtone does impede the sensitive nerves a bit, nevertheless, it is not my favorite Kubrick's film, but it is an outstanding comedy which I presume can stay untainted by numerous re-watches, for me the first round is more than gratifying and since my generally inert resistance towards war-related films, a second round may take some time despite of its overall peerlessness.",

One of the obvious highlights of this film would have to be Peter Seller's performances as three distinct characters. George C. Scott also delivers a very respectable performance as a general advising the president. Then, there is Slim Pickens who is often remembered for the famous bomb riding scene.

Thanks to his trademark perfectionist attitude, he was able to capture every shot perfectly in black and white, utilized cut scenes of actors giving over-the-top performances (a hilarious George C. Scott), and got the best performance ever out of the genius Peter Sellers.  One of my favorite movies of all time, and Kubrick's greatest film in my opinion.",

But, I guess I can review it well I can, Its a satire that takes place at war that takes place in Three different places at the same time:\n\n1. Peter Sellers plays some sort of General. He is that screw up kind of character who has to fight some enemies. There is a joke about a Coca-Cola machine not working which is hilarious.\n\n2. Slim PIckens plays \"King Kong\" who is a pilot with a bunch of nukes in his plane. James Earl Jones also stars in this part where he is in the plane also. In one scene, King Kong rides a nuke that is falling and he explodes with it. Its genius. \n\n3. The Best and most Shocking Part. The President and A Ex-Nazi Dr. Strangelove try to figure out where the doomsday device is and who has it. I will not ruin anything about the ending of the movie, but I will say there is a funny scene where one of them are getting into a fight and one of the people in the room says \"Gentlemen, There is No Fighting In The War Room.\" \n\nIts a great black and white satire on war that was a risky move back when the cuba missle crisis was on going. Kubrick's Strangelove is a movie that should not be missed for movie buffs.\n\n96/100 A",

This dark comedy is shot entirely in black and white with terrific production design. Astutely, Kubrick focuses on the actual nuclear event in itself, thus removing the issues of foreign politics. The films message simply put its this; man is not at the mercey of machines,but it in fact it's just the opposite.

George C. Scott is hilarious as Gen. Buck Turgidson, who tries to reason with the president that attacking the Soviets might not be such a bad idea. Classic film-making at it's very best with Kubrick at the top of his game.
