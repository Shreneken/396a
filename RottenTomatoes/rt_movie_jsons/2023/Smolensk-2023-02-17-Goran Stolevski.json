Written and directed by Goran Stolevski, it's a film informed by his growing up gay and Serbian in Melbourne. The film is set in two time periods, each one taking place in only a handful of days. The first period is 1999. High schooler Ebony has woken up drunk on a beach after a big night out. She calls her friend and dance partner Kol to help and pick her up. He enlists the help of her older brother Adam to drive across the city to find her. The thirty minute or so conversation in the car is a near perfect scene of conversation and understanding, just beautifully observed. We discover eventually that Adam is gay and that Kol more than likely is, something he hides from his conservative Serbian family. Over the next day they get to know each better. Fast forward to 2010 and both men are returning to Melbourne to attend Ebony's wedding. We then find out where their lives have taken them. The wedding is the perfect place to go visit regrets and misfortune. This is a beautiful film. So tender and honest. A film about knowing yourself and showing yourself. A film about relationships and missed opportunities. Thom Green and Elias Anton are wonderful in the lead roles. A small Australian classic.",

            "content": "\"Of An Age\" is the story of a burgeoning relationship between two men, but it's not an in-your-face political statement about gay relationships.  In fact, because of the film's intense focus on that moment of total infatuation where only two people exist in the world, gender is almost incidental.\nMacedonian-born Aussie Writer/Director Goren Stolevski's second film centers on a single day in 1999 when Adam (Thom Green) and Kol (Elias Anton) meet.  Kol receives a frantic call from his ballroom dance partner Ebony.  She's slept off the consequences of a long night on an unknown beach.  The only way Kol can retrieve her and make the Dance Finals is to beg Ebony's brother, Adam, for a ride.  While traveling in a car together, Kol and Adam start with banter and a tentative discussion of literature and philosophy.  But the conversation and the sense of connection quickly turn into something much deeper.\nAdam and Kol are both charismatic and appealing.  Anton is an awkward seventeen, enthralled by the mature man who's at least four years older and much more worldly-wise.  While Kol is still struggling with defining himself in a conservative household of Macedonian emigrants, Adam seems to have it all figured out.  In fact, Adam is leaving the next day to begin his graduate studies in South America.  So theirs is a relationship killed by circumstance before it can ever develop.\nA brief Act Two reintroduces the two characters in 2010 at Ebony's wedding.  It's a powerful postscript to their earlier encounter.  While incidentally noting that the world has changed dramatically in the intervening eleven years, there's a painful wistfulness shared by Kol and Adam that's simply heartbreaking.\nCinematographer Matthew Chuang (\"Blue Bayou\") uses an in-your-face camera technique that inserts us into the thoughts and feelings of these appealing characters.  At times, however, the sense of intimacy and immediacy feels almost claustrophobic.\nWhat's missing here is actual character development.  While the sense of connection between Adam and Kol is extremely powerful, the story suffers because they are such obvious stereotypes.  Adam is older, wiser and more jaded.  In many ways, we understand Kol solely in terms of his confusion, awkwardness and naivet\u00e9.  This reduces the emotional impact of the film, though only slightly.\nAt the end of the day, this is a film with universal appeal.  Everyone will recognize the tension, exhilaration and obsession of first love.  Some will leave the theater grieving that they did not end up with the love of their lives.  The rest of us will walk away with an even deeper appreciation for what we have.",

I'm not quite sure I understand them completely.\n\nThe acting is OK, minus the female lead, she is all over the place ridiculous with her acting, and I believe it's the script that made it so terrible, to watch her on the screen.\n\nThe two lead males, do not have real chemistry or connection like they should, and the emotions you do not get the emotions from the film like you should. The intimacy scene is just not even intimate. It's kind of there and done. So the entire thing is very confusing. I thought I was going to get a story about these individuals, but I ended up getting a fake love story. \n\nUltimately, the movie is more of a streaming film instead of a theatrical release, but at the end of the day, it's also one of those films that you can just go never mind I don't need to add that to my watchlist. I don't recommend it to be honest with you.",
