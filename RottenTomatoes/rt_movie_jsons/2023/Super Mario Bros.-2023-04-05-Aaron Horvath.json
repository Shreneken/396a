This movie is the equivalent of a nostalgic movie and really does a great job capturing the main antagonist. \nGreat movie, a good 5 in a half star ;)",

            "content": "In 1993 I watched the Super Mario Bros movie with Bob Hoskins completely dumbfounded. I was a child, and a lover of Nintendo's Mario Games, and this Hollywood movie seemed to borrow more from 1989's Batman or Blade Runner rather than the colorful world of the iconic video game.\n\nFast forward 30 years later, I sat watching the credits of the new Super Mario Bros movie, surrounded by teenagers, wondering \"Why didn't we get this movie when I was a kid?\"\n\nThere is no denying that Super Mario Bros (2023) is a love letter to the original Nintendo franchise and its generation of fans. Whether you grew up playing the original Super Mario Bros, Super Mario World, Mario 64 or the endless roster of games that are enjoyed by children today, the movie seems to have callbacks for everyone. Even Mario's original arcade rival, Donkey Kong, appears in a standout scene - barrels and all!\n\nFor those who know nothing about Mario, the premise is simple: Mario and his brother Luigi are plumbers from Brooklyn who get sucked into a world full of mushrooms, ruled by Princess Peach, who must face the evil King Bowser, who plans to force the Princess' hand into marriage. In other words, it's the same premise as any of the games.\n\nIf there's a moral to the story, it's to never give up. In a scene where Mario must train to do battle, he continues to fail over and over again. If he fails, he goes back to the beginning and must start over. It's a very meta call-back to the actual game where the player fails a level time and time again only to get better and better and finally achieve victory.\n\nIf you're expecting high level cinema or something deeper beyond that, you won't find it here. Though honestly I question anyone to expect that from a Nintendo / Illumination crossover. It's still bright and colorful, has \"adorable\" characters (as the film self-proclaims) and is filled with fast-paced action. It's a fine film for parents to take their kids to and will certainly hit that nostalgia button for gamers of all ages.",

Every character was done super well too no pun intended, and I for one can't wait for a sequel to see who joins the cast next.

This movie is amazing, stargazing, colorful, and I can go on and on about this movie. First of all, the animation is fabulous for it being illumination, the people who made\u2026 hop. Although illumination made some bad and bland movies in its time, this movie had a good animation with colorful bright skies in the mushroom kingdom, the fiery scenery in Bowser's Castle, the icy plains of the penguin's kingdom (I don't remember the band of the kingdom, I think it's just called Ice Land), and the light, calm way the movie started with Mario & Luigi's nice, peaceful hometown Brooklyn. It was a good way to keep me entertained. Lastly, all the references make it so fun for the people who remember the old classic 1980s-1990s games. For example, the beginning of the movie, after Bowser gets the star. The movie pops up to the Plumbing commercial they made, but the lyrics from the first 10 seconds is the theme from The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! The girl in the plumbing commercial in the beginning saying \"Thank you, Super Mario Bros! It seems like the only thing you haven't drained is my bank account..??!?!\" Is Princess Peach also from The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! The cast is also perfect, Chris Pratt was actually not bad for being Mario, and same thing for Seth Rogen as being Donkey Kong. Don't listen to what other people say about it. Give it a try.",

I think Charlie Day was perfect for voicing the role of Luigi and every character that ended up being voices their real life actor for perfectly into the roles I went into this movie expecting little to nothing on how good it was going to be but it was entertaining and I highly recommend this to any adult or teenager that has or still plays that Mario Games.

It's one of the best animated films I've seen in a long while, and it's a simple movie, and that's okay. We don't need or want a big complicated plot for Mario, just a movie that cares about the audience and the source material.",

I enjoyed every single moment of this action-packed, family film and I must say that I give both Nintendo and Illumination all the credit from taking this spectacular initiative for finally introducing a movie that has actually broken many barriers and boundaries in our globalized society despite what the critics deemed it to be.\n\nI absolutely love everything about this movie from the awesome characters, the iconic video game soundtracks, all the way to the brilliant cast that was presented in this movie. The storyline of this movie definitely meet the requirements of the Super Mario gaming concepts that the world is familiar with and adores so much. It may not be classified as an Academy Award winning movie yet it is, without a doubt, a movie that people of all ages have enjoyed on a regular basis especially those who truly comprehend and appreciate the Super Mario Legacy. Furthermore, this movie has opened up the eyes of the entire world thus convincing billions of fans what Super Mario has to offer and how much joy Mario has given around the globe.\n\nIn conclusion, I consider myself to be very lucky and proud to be a part of this glorious moment in my timeline where this movie has finally come into existence and that Mario has always continued to become a major impact on people's lives and the popularity of Mario will always continue to grow. I sincerely hope that this move will continue to flourish and that The Box Office will recognize this film as one of the greats; not only in terms of it's revenue but of a very high standard of cinematography. I am keeping my fingers crossed expecting this movie to make at least $1Billion.\n\nWAY TO GO MARIO!!! WAHOOO!!!",

The music is such an important part of the Mario experience, and it's likely that the movie will use these tunes to great effect. A score that's faithful to the games, but also fresh and updated for a modern audience, could be a great addition to the movie.\n\nReferences: 9/10 - Another exciting aspect of the Mario movie is the potential for references to the games and other media in the Mario universe. Fans are hoping for Easter eggs, nods, and cameos that will make them feel nostalgic and rewarded for their dedication to the franchise. However, there's a risk of going overboard with references and relying too heavily on fan service. It's a fine balance that the movie will have to strike.\n\nVisuals: 10/10 - It was really surprising  to know this was a illumination movie. Compared to the studios more mediocre movies, this one was a breath of fresh air. It was a nice breakaway from the boring despicable me-esk visuals. This movie could be the start of a illumination golden era!\n\nPlot: 7/10 - This is perhaps the biggest unknown when it comes to the Mario movie. While we know that the movie will feature Mario and his friends on an adventure, we don't yet know what that adventure will entail. There's a risk of a plot that's too thin or too reliant on action and spectacle, without enough heart or character development. However, with the right writers and directors on board, the Mario movie could surprise us with a clever and engaging story that stays true to the spirit of the games.\n\nOverall, I think that this movie was generally a great watch for any generation ( especially for those who grew up with mario). However, i think it does have its problems. Such as a more predictable plot but that is mostly espected from a kids movie. Overall a 4/5  super stars.",

It's nostalgic, yet fresh, super fun and sweet, the music was re orchestrated beautifully and perfectly placed\u2026 it was simply pure entertainment. No agendas, no politics, just a fantastic family movie that paid homage to characters beloved by generations without overindulgent fan service or totally destroying the source. It was so balanced and respectful. I will be honest, cinema has been terrible the last few years, so I had my reservations, but it honestly was fantastic. This is what family films should be made of!",

There are a staggering amount of Easter eggs to be found but the minuscule boost in serotonin could not save this movie from feeling mediocre. I watched the movie on a weekend packed with families and their children. The theatre was quiet. I can't tell if the kids were just so engaged they could not react or that the movie just missed on the jokes. But ultimately I came walking away wondering who this movie was for. It didn't seem to hit with the kids that you think an illumination movie would hit, but its also does not hold up as a film that adults would enjoy past the nostalgia or Easter eggs. However with those critiques aside the animation was great everything looked amazing, the dialogue was way better than expected. The Bowser line from the trailer on Universal Canada's Youtube \"I've finally found it, now who's gonna stop me\" is taken out and replaced with something else and the Mario line \"Mushroom Kingdom here we come\" was removed entirely. \n\nThis is definitely worth supporting as there is probably going to be a Mario Cinematic Universe, but if you are one of those people that don't like theatres then wait until the movie comes to streaming platforms. I would love to see how they improve down the line. Here's hoping it improves as well or better than the Marvel Cinematic Universe or we get that one outstanding film like a Spiderverse.",

Other positives to note is that I did chuckle a few times but most of the funny bits are in the trailer. I also thought they gave Mario and the rest of the characters a passable origin story without using up too much time. Now for the negatives. I think they could have included more jokes, or improved on the ones they had. The story was as simple as you can make it. I wish they were a little more creative with the ending. My main gripe is the inclusion of pop songs in a friggin NINTENDO movie! Nintendo has an amazing catalogue of songs to use, just stick with that. We don't need another movie with an AC/DC song in it. The voice acting was passable but not amazing either. Literally anyone could replace them and it would be ok. Overall, its a kids movie, and it shows. I just wish the director could make it more entertaining for adults as well. I would love a Luigi's mansion movie or other Spin-offs.

They were on the edge of their seats sometimes, huddled in the back of them other times.  A few times they were cheering, and they got a lot of the humor as well.  From my perspective the nostalgia was done very well, not too little or much, and the movie was executed very well also, particularly given that there isn't a lot to the base Mario story.  Bowser was terrifying and powerful, but also funny and creepily sentimental.  It's a very faithful adaptation while still making for a good, well paced movie experience.  And I'll be honest (mild possible spoilers ahead), I actually teared up at a couple of points, such as when the song Holding Out For a Hero plays, or when there is a flashback of baby Mario saving baby Luigi from being bullied.  I was NOT expecting to tear up.  Very well done Nintendo and Illumination.",

She really enjoyed it. My laughter clued her in that it was not a scary movie but a silly game with ridiculous characters. Great soundtrack. And of course, Jack Black. \nI had forgotten how much I liked Mario and Luigi 30 odd years ago. \nNo video game knowledge is necessary to enjoy this.

The cast was awful, the plot was everywhere, the humor was confusing and many times I felt really lost, similar to the humor in Schindler's List, my LEAST favorite comedy. The dialogue was way too wordy and I found myself constantly having to ask Siri what many of the words even meant! How embarrassing for the writers LOL! The only redeemable quality of this movie is Anya-Taylor Joys sexy performance as Princess Peach. Her voice is fire. Her cadence erotic. I found myself completely erect multiple different times during this movie, maybe it was the Cialis I took before, or maybe it was just the way Anya says whatever she says during the movie. With that said, this thing was Rotten!!! Peace and Love!!",

If there is a sequel (As they left us on a cliffhanger) please make it longer than this movie. By the way why is Charles Manirent in the cast like what?

Such screen time is needed to bring to the plot important components of the video game franchise, which are neglected by controversial choices for a film that should be centered on the brothers Mario and Luigi. Despite this, the characterization of the characters, in general, provides a competent extrapolation of the few inputs that the games' stories provided us, as well as the use of the chosen power-ups, and both the visual aspects and the soundtrack delight fans of the duo of the most famous plumbers in the world.",

If you are a Nintendo fan, and you have a heart, then I recommend this movie wholeheartedly!",

Movement was smooth and when paired with the visuals created a vibrant spectacle that is a must watch from an animation stand point. \n\nFrom an acting stand point surprisingly the things I was ready to nit pick and had severe worries with were not present. Each character is stuck to with severe intensity with some changes being made. The changes do not take from the movie or characters who are very well portrayed keeping to the source material. I am willing to admit that I had a rant about peach being portrayed as a bad ass when I watched the trailer. It simply was not true and the portrayal was marvellous.

(Except the Luma star, he was making me feel uncomfortable.)\n\u2022Great Soundtrack\n\u2022The dog fight was funny.\n\u2022The beginning of Mario's Fight with DK and when Mario turned into a cat during the fight were funny.\n\u2022The Post-Credits was a nice surprise.\n\u2022So surprised to see many Nintendo References in this movie. (Punch Out, Kid Icarus, Jumpman, etc.)\n\u2022Very surprised to see a bunch of cameos in this movie.\n\u2022Bowser playing the piano and singing was great.\n\nNeutral Points\n\u2022The Voices weren't the best nor the worst I would think of them as Decent.\n\nCons\n\u2022It felt like the movie was going too fast.\n\u2022The appearances of Mario and Luigis' family was mediocre.\n\u2022There should have been more Luigi Action. (I mean he was able to fit through the bars to slip out and climb up the chains.)\n\nFinal Response\nOverall, this was a Great Movie and I can't wait for the sequel. But they're could have been a few thing to improve on. This deserves a 4/5.",

It is easily a perfect family movie and the references to other Nintendo franchises were done incredibly well and appeal to Nintendo fans of all shapes and sizes. The fact that this movie has a 59% right now from critics is genuinely criminal however there are definitely some things wrong with it. First of all Take on me was an odd choice as a song and was easily the worst part of the entire movie which is honestly a compliment considering it's really the only thing I can think of that wasn't done very well. Some people don't like the voice actors\u2026 I don't know what those people want all of the  voice actors were really good except for cranky kong for some reason. Some critics say that the movie has a thin plot and to a certain extent I guess they are right but it's got about the same depth of plot as your average Disney movie which is to say that it's not insanely complex or anything like that, it's definitely pretty straightforward and linear but I think that for their target audience it definitely had the right amount of plot. Other critics might say that it was fast paced, these critics are also right and I agree with them but I think that is it weren't so fast paced it would've been a lot harder to fit so much into the film, also maybe it's just me but I kind of enjoyed it being so fast paced but I think that this is a pretty valid objection. I think that critics simply come in expecting some insanely awesome film which will change your thinking after you watch it, the Mario Movie is a lot things but that is not one of them. If you are expecting a fun family movie with tons of Nintendo references than boy are you in the right place! In other words if you are asking yourself if the Mario Movie is worth your time you're asking the wrong question, you should be asking if you are worth the Mario Movie's time.",

Then that's it. This movie is for you. And you are going to have a blast! Mario is the most recognized video game face and stepping up to the plate to make his movie is a big ask, but I'm glad Illumination lived up to it.

Yes, I will admit, Bowser's song, 'Peaches.', was funny, even though he was so hard to like as a character. The movie made quite a few references to the older games, Super Mario Run and even the T-shaped run from Super Mario Odyssey, when fighting Bowser. Of course, the most noticeable one was the karts. I loved the part where Luigi saves Mario. It shook me. Luigi was always said to be dragged down with Mario or living in Mario's shadow.\n\n\nOverall, the movie was impeccable with the design and animation (Rainbow Road was amazingly done), and the characters were engaging the whole time.",

They don't take any time to flesh out the worlds or characters or their development and relationships but simply go from point A to B while including as many references from the video games as possible.

This mixture between the real thing and the 2d video game is a very big and pleasant plus.\n\nThen we will move on to a fictional world, which will bring with it, in addition to a good load of memories, a large amount of adventure and action. Here, the story leaves the everyday behind and we find ourselves with adventure and more adventure, with little context, since the context is provided by the video game, it is nice to see how the characters, antagonists and main challenges of Donkey Kong and Mario, little by little are fitting into history; With pleasant surprise we see how some characters are given another meaning, an example of this: 'the princess', who little fulfills her role as a damsel in distress to become a strong and valuable character BUT, preserving all her feminine, sweet and pleasant. The main Bad guy is not so typical either, he's a love-struck bad guy and SOMETIMES kind of cute.\n\nThe ending also follows the same formula, satisfying, beautiful, with a lot of action, mixing the real world with the video game, yes, all this in a good-natured, calm environment suitable for all audiences, without being childish, however for some reason it is rated PG (with parental guidance) however I think it is more than suitable for all audiences.\n\nRating\n-Idea 8/10\n- Story 7/10\n- Script 6/10\n- Characters 7/10\n- Effects 7/10\n- Entertaining 8/10\n\nAge PG (For all ages with parental supervision)",

You can tell the team behind the movie put a lot of care and effort into crafting it. So many easter eggs pop up that it's impossible to notice all of them in one sitting. Stop reading and go, go, go see the movie!",

The story moves from one scene to the next but it is a movie where the stakes were low as is so it didn't trouble me much. I don't get the funk of putting generic songs like \"Holding out for a Hero\" or \"Take On Me\" during parts where you can simply replace it with a song from one of the games. Those parts, when the songs came up, did make me cringe and just sink into my seat. When watching a movie called The Super Mario Bros., they had to emphasize the whole brothers' shtick because Luigi was very underused and forgotten. It didn't help that Mario got more screentime than his brother which upset me.\nOther than that just a silly Mario movie and definitely better than the one from the 90s.",

It includes a perfect balance of fan service by cleverly working many elements from the Mario universe into nearly every scene which most gamers will be familiar with, but I think anyone can enjoy. The pacing is kept tight to the runtime which I appreciate, so in my opinion the plot is just as deep as it needs to be.",

The very first video game i got introduced was the super mario 64, on my first video game console which is the nintendo 64.   I got to see almost all the characters: mario, luigi, princess toadstool (Peach), king koopa (Bowser), the entire koopa army from gombas to spike koopas to even kamek (the magikoopa).   In the DK (Donkey Kong) scene, I would have never thought that they actually put the DK 64 Rap on the fighting sense of mario vs DK.   (Honestly that was pretty neat).   but in the end of the movie, thats where it actually hit me, while i am enjoying the movie, i felt the movie taught me a lesson.   (To never give up on your dreams, no matter if everyone is against you.   Still just don't give up).   But honestly I hope there will be a sequel to this movie.   its definitely worth the time watching it.",
