Just the right kind of film to unwind with at the end of the day. Also, it's interesting how director Ashima Chibber has used all the Bollywood masala without letting it overpower the film. It has the stars, the songs and the one-liners that make you want to clap and whistle, but its feet remain firmly on the ground throughout as you follow the protagonist Debika Chatterjee in the fight of her life against a powerful foreign nation that thinks it can squash her like a fly. The dramatic maze into which Devika is plunged, the sense of claustrophobia, of the walls closing in around you, the hunt for the kids, the chase at one point, which I don't want to give away here, are all portrayed really well with a restraint that is unlike any Bollywood film, without being any less impactful. The acting is great. Rani Mukerji clearly gave everything to the role both as an actor and as a proud Bengali mom. She is fantastic. Also impressive is the way Anirban Bhattacharya managed to rise above all the cliches of his role of a bad husband to deliver a totally believable and even sympathetic rendition of man stuck in a bizarre situation trying to save whatever he can in his limited way, and sadly failing. Best of all were the evil social workers, played by Estonian actresses, who managed to steal the scene every time with their spiteful looks and sinister sideways glances that said it all! Hope we get to see a lot more of those two and their witch-like boss, also Estonian, in Indian cinema!",
