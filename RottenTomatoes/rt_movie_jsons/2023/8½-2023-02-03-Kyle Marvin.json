The ensemble cast is amazing as they make you feel everything the character feels they at every point in the movie. If you like romcom sports movies then this movie is a must see in my opinion.",

            "content": "I did some minor research and yes, three out of the four actresses of 80 for Brady are indeed in their 80s, with Rita Moreno in her 90s, so there is some truth in advertising still. Speaking of that, this geriatric comedy is about everything you would expect from its very basic premise. Inspired by a true story, four lifelong friends (Moreno, Jane Fonda, Sally Field, Lily Tomlin) are diehard New England Patriots fans and more so fans of the team's famous quarterback, Mr. Tom Brady (playing himself). They're determined to make one last big trip to support their team at the 2017 Super Bowl, as Tomlin is afraid she doesn't have much time left. What follows is standard road trip hi-jinks and celebrity cameos the likes of which from Billy Porter and Guy Fieri and Patton Oswalt. Most of the jokes are mild and easily telegraphed, and the formula hews very close to other studio entries in the \"old people still got it\" ensemble comedy subgenre (Last Vegas, Book Club, The Bucket List, Going in Style, Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, Calendar Girls, etc.). The target audience is looking for something nice and reassuring with familiar faces. To that end, 80 for Brady mostly succeeds, but for anyone else outside it's older demographic, it will be a middling and hokey comedy. I laughed out loud at the assertion that the Pats comeback from a 28-3 deficit versus the Atlanta Falcons was the result of one very determined, yet also obsessive to the point of hallucinating, elderly fan giving Brady a special pep talk that motivated him to try harder at winning. The movie isn't meant to elicit big laughs, more pleasant smiles, and to that end it's agreeably inoffensive right down to its predictability and easy conclusions. Entirely skippable if you're under the age of 50.\n\nNate's Grade: C",

            "content": "It's often pretty cringe and the presence of Tom Brady does nothing to help that, but overall the light and breezy entertainment value of 80 for Brady is tough to entirely deny. Thanks to some of my (everyone's really) favorite elder statesmen Tomlin and Field, the mostly weightless story is given a bit of life and some much needed heart. It is, to be completely honest, pretty touching at times but that mileage may vary dependent on your patience for sports metaphors for real life hardships. It has a couple of laughs courtesy of a few good comedic performances from Ron Funches and Jimmy O. Yang (Jian Yang from Silicon Valley) but overall is more on the \"this is wholesome\" side of things and is not very funny. So, I guess if you like football, you like a couple of these actresses, and you want to spend 100 minutes in wholesomeville, then you could do a lot worse than 80 for Brady.",

The storyline was so predictable, even if you have never heard of the \"Actual Events\" that this was based on. I'd never heard about this team of elderly Tom Brady fans but, already knew the outcome of the game and this left for no edge of seat surprise ending. I'd wished they would have added a bit more fantasy to the storyline and gave it more of an adventure feeling. Even the chili eating contest was a boring part of the movie. Well that's all I have to say about this. In all actuality all anyone would need to do is Google Super Bowl LI and you could skip the movie all together.

The plot is predictable and lacks any depth or complexity. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, and the acting is mediocre.\n\nThe only saving grace of this movie is its star-studded cast, which includes Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, Rita Moreno, and Sally Field. However, even their talent can't save this train wreck of a movie.\n\nThe cinematography is unremarkable, and the direction lacks any flair or creativity. The film's attempts at humour fall flat, and the so-called emotional moments are contrived and forced.\n\nIn conclusion, \"80 for Brady\" is a complete waste of time. Look elsewhere if you're looking for a heartwarming movie about friendship and aging. I give this movie a 3 out of 10 and recommend you stay far away from it.",

You can NEVER go wrong with Lili Tomlin and Jane Fonda and then adding to the DYNAMIC DUO was Sally Field and Rita Moreno. The chemistry was so excellent between them. The story was absolutely great. Acting was FANTASTIC and Lili Tomlin was the BEST. Hope she gets nominated for Best Actress next year. You never see movies targeting a much older audience as in this case over 80. It was so pure, genuine, fun, funny, relaxing and comforting movie. A big pleasure to be watching this on the big screen where they belong. Please if you haven't watched it, please do.

And Sally Field will have that young girl look forever. She is always a joy to watch (Not Without My Daughter, Forrest Gump are personal favorites). While this is clearly a Tom Brady vanity project (he was producer) & the game footage was amazing, he would be best suited to making his next career chapter one in sports broadcasting or commercials. The true story this movie was based on is heart warming, While it definitely wasn't a waste of time & I was glad to see it (on discount night) with friends, my recommendation is to wait for it to come to cable.",

My life is bookended with Jane Fonda sports comedies.  And in between I ran into her once as she came out of an elevator outside of my office in the State Capitol Building in Sacto.  I've looked at life from both sides now, and still somehow,.. she's still annoying.  Not Fonda Jane.  Nor the 3 others.  This movie is like watching the harpies on 'The VIEW'.

And then to see Brady telling the Tomlin character thank you for her encouraging words...admitting that many people think he's the fighter, the one who never gives up, the hero...and in his words in the movie, Tomlin is the real hero the real fighter...and, I believe, he is really speaking to his mother here.\n\nSo many funny scenes....so many touching scenes. Great casting with Sally Fields as the statistician, Fonda as the flirt, seeing Moreno dancing, and Tomlin, screwy but serious as well. I highly recomment the film. Just a true delight. \nPS: if you don't like Brady, go anyway. The movie is mainly about these four amazing women playing the four women who really did this! Special treat: photo of the real four women shown at the end in the credits!",

Despite me not being the target audience for this movie, it had a lot of jokes that even I was laughing at. Obviously this movie has a ton of flaws but this was just something to shut your brain off. I think most of the budget went to the cast and all of the cameos because there were a few scenes that looked like the production value of a Nickelodeon episode. Also the acting wasn't the best at points and the writing was meh. Overall, if you're a sports fan or the target audience, you'll find this movie enjoyable. Obviously this isn't peak cinema but you'll have a fun time.",

            "content": "When I find that rare movie that appeals to the boomer generation I can't peel off to the movie theatre fast enough. 80 For Brady starring Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Rita Moreno, and Sally Field promised to be just what I was looking for – as well as the popcorn and diet fountain Coke. My husband even agreed to go with my girlfriend and me because it was about football.\n\nPerhaps because I know so little about football other than it is a brutally violent game involving little more than run and fall down, over and over and over again, I didn't know what to expect. With those four leading ladies, and inspired by a true story, how could it not guarantee an afternoon of fun and laughs?\n\nThe premise is the four \"old\" ladies are huge football fans and in particular, are huge fans of the gorgeous Tom Brady. So far, so good. When they cannot afford tickets to attend the Super Bowl they enter a contest for free tickets. Of course, they win (sort of) and proceed to lose those precious tickets at the pre-game tailgate party. High jinks ensue and they change the course of football history.\n\nI must tell you upfront that I had to revise this review because I thought my first draft was too harsh. 80 For Brady is a light comedy with a stellar cast and some good laughs. The majority of people who see it love it. I did not.\n\nThis old boomer broad thought 80 For Brady was a total waste of time and talent. It was a stupid movie with weak, trite writing and ridiculously clichéd sight gags. There is practically nothing about the movie that I liked. Even the wigs were horrendous.\n\nKudos to Sally Field who was the best of the four leading ladies with her honest-to-goodness real-life hair and real-life face. Fonda, Tomlin, and Moreno's closeups were all shot in soft focus to look like they were about thirty years old and it was just ridiculous.\n\nNone of the three ladies (including Tomlin, surprisingly) could move her upper lip because it had been so shot full of Botox and fillers. It was disturbing to watch. They are supposed to be women in their eighties—Fonda and Tomlin are in fact in their eighties; Moreno is in her nineties, and Field, the baby, is in her seventies for heaven's sake!\n\n\nThe movie could and should have been better than it is.\nIf you have not seen the movie, you might really enjoy it. For those who have already seen it and thoroughly enjoyed it, congratulations. I did not. What did you think? My husband enjoyed it because it was about football; my girlfriend wasn't crazy about it either. Even the popcorn was too salty.\n\nThe End.",

I really did not expect it to be as entertaining as it was — I genuinely had a smile on my face the whole way through! Seeing these legendary actresses come together in one film and prove they've still got it was such a delight! I loved seeing them all on the big screen again! Rita Moreno and Sally Field were my obvious favourites, but you can't deny the talents of Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin! Sure, the story and everything else was far from perfect — it's certainly not a critical darling — but this movie was exactly what it needed to be. It's full of heart, full of all the warm feelings that come with a good friendship so I can't complain! Yes, it was cheesy, yes, it definitely stretched its premise a little too far… but I had a genuinely good time with it! This lightweight comedy is a win, whether you are a fan of Tom Brady or not!

            "content": "80 for Brady is a perfect movie to watch with a best friend, family member and sports fan. What I love about this movie is that it successfully connects the importance of being courageous, while trusting those closest to you to overcome your biggest obstacles in both sports and in life. Also, what else would you expect from Tom Brady (producer), but an inspiring movie about the power of attitude and belief to pull off miracles.\n\nThe story follows four best friends, Lou (Lily Tomlin), Trish (Jane Fonda), Betty (Sally Field) and Maura (Rita Moreno) who, for 16 straight years, loyally followed Tom Brady's career. After watching the Patriots' 2017 AFC Playoff win, Lou asks her friends to join her for an unforgettable adventure - \"Let's go to the Super Bowl LI.\" \nThe movie is hilarious with scenes of dancing, funny sports superstitions and includes live action and original sound from the Super Bowl LI experience.  Several scenes include live audio of player commentary on the field that you've likely never heard before. One of my favorite scenes is when Lou finally has the chance to talk to Tom Brady in an emotional speech, which inspires us to never give up.  The game brings us back to the greatest comeback, both in Patriots history, and in Tom Brady's incredible sports career. The love of football connects us as Americans and the true story of four loyal women, who followed Tom's career for 16 years to finally make it to the Super Bowl, is inspiring for us all – even if you're not a Tom Brady fan. To see Lou, Trish, Betty and Maura having a great time attending exclusive parties, dancing with Gugu's (Billy Porter) dance crew, eating in Guy Fieri's spicy hot wing contest and gambling with high rollers really brings one hilarious scene to another. This film shows that both your age and life challenges can't stop you if you believe you've still got it. I can't wait to have the chance to go to a Super Bowl myself someday with my best friends and family. What an adventure. \n\nThe message of the movie is about the importance of friendship and courage to overcome obstacles and embrace the unknown together. The film reminds us to trust in our loved ones; never let fear stop us; and live life to the fullest. \n\nI give 80 For Brady 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

You can see that they had loads of fun working together, so its a delight to enjoy the magic of their bond. How wonderful to have gotten them together for this curtain call on their tremendous and memorable careers!!!",

There is little doubt that the names of Tomlin, Fonda, Moreno and Field will bring back smiles and memories of prior performance that will generate interest and ticket sales appeal. Adding the name of Tom Brady may have had a little more appeal before the luster of personal and football losses clouded his winning persona to the masses. The title of the movie may be the most revealing commentary on who the target audience just might be. It is of interest knowing that Tom Brady's response, when asked if he felt any connection to working with his female cast was, \"They are working hard and they love it so good for them\". The fact that Brady has chosen to retire at age 45 pales in comparison to his still working cast whose ages range from 71 to 91. One may wonder if Mr. Brady may have had a few more years left in his equally brilliant career? This is a GOOD movie. The more senior the audience the more enjoyment will be experienced. The story line becomes secondary to the lives being shared on the big screen. Friendships, loss and dreams yet to be fulfilled will have you smiling and anticipating a future to be enjoyed. Feel good movies may not be exciting but they do provide a respite from a film industry that today exists for special effects, kill em all and super heroes. Grab a friend, or just like the movie, 3 or 4, and share the smiles and laughter that have always been the best parts of true friendships.\nRating: A - A - A -B = Aging Ain't All Bad",

The last 45 minutes are just fantastic. Just to see Brady, Gronk, Amendola and Edelmann reunited....just WOW. Just to relive the SuperBowl with the Pats down 28 to 3 in the 3rd and making a miraculous comeback. Really, really exciting. All 4 actresses did a great job. I found myself laughing quite a bit. Kudos to the changing shirts scene....I forgot all about that and it made me laugh. Good all around job and perfect movie for this time of year..with the SuperBowl right around the corner. BIG THUMBS UP!!!!!!",
