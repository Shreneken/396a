It was pretty to look at, was mis-paced, and generally a dull 2 hours. Incredible how this is being reviewed right now. Nothing special to see here, and this director is clearly in need of excellent producer assistance to anything worth watching. I was underwhelmed by every technical element of this story, which at times seemed to almost patronize the dumb cows it imagines the modern audience to be with giant text overlays explaining what certain acronyms and jingoisms mean, but not all of them.

I'm not sure why people just don't flop to the theaters to support him. \n\nBut this movie is very well written, very well, directed, and Guy. Ritchie definitely deserves Oscar nominations from this film, that's how great I think this film is. \n\nLittle man loved every moment of the film that he didn't budge an inch, he was so glued to the screen and watching this film, and when he got out, he told me how much he loved it. \n\nI highly recommend check in this film out in theaters.",

            "content": "As the two-decade-long war in Afghanistan relentlessly raged on, the US military hired scores of locals to serve as interpreters in the conflict against the Taliban, a risky proposition for these Afghan nationals, given that they were seen by their countrymen as traitors. In exchange for their services, however, they were promised a hefty reward \u2013 visas to emigrate to America for themselves and their families. Nevertheless, this promise often came with undisclosed strings, particularly lengthy delays for issuing the documents, leaving the interpreters in the lurch as they anxiously awaited their flight to freedom. Their story is the subject of \"Guy Ritchie's The Covenant,\" an amalgamation of the interpreters' wartime experiences told through the tale of a heroic translator, Ahmed (Dar Salim), who rescues his commanding officer, Sgt. John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal), under perilous conditions but who is subsequently forced into hiding after his story receives widespread attention and makes him a highly valued Taliban target. When Sgt. Kinley is safely at home and hears what happened to his colleague, he vows to return to Afghanistan to secure refuge for the man who saved his life. Movies about extricating those trapped behind enemy lines are common in the annals of filmdom, and this offering is very much cut from the same cloth (save for the venue), so there's not much that really differentiates it from comparable offerings. However, the film's superbly executed second half \u2013 a far cry better than its overlong, sometimes-tedious first hour \u2013 helps to make up for this. The back end also features far better writing than what's found in the trite, corny war movie dialogue of the opening act. And it helps that the picture has a superb score and is beautifully shot. It's just unfortunate that the two halves of this release aren't on par with one another, as that would have made for a much better film, even with a narrative as fundamentally formulaic as this one. I must admit that I'm always somewhat skeptical about movies that have an individual's name at the beginning of the title (makes me think the studio/distributor is trying too hard to sell it, based on the individual's reputation than the quality of the work at hand), and I suppose I should have maintained more of that skepticism where this film is concerned. While \"The Covenant\" is far from a bad picture, it certainly could have been better (or at least better balanced), and then it wouldn't have had to rely on the director's name at the top of the marquee to coax viewers into the theater.",

The reality of getting interpreters safe lives in the impossible world of government burocracy which is clearly not what the interpreters are led to believe. I feel though that the movie is soft on that topic even though it feels like it will take that step forward and call out the government for its lack of accountability. (Spoiler alert) The protagonist finds a way and is owed enough favors to get things done but that's not how things are in the real world . I think what the movie does a good job of is continue to highlight the fact that there is a debt to be paid and small or large, sacrifices were made by locals to help with the mission success of the US (the big picture). My opinion, interpreters and their families should be moved to US housing to protect them while the paperwork takes place. This is written by a veteran and my reality is , a brother is a brother regardless of circumstance.",

            "content": "The Covenant is a gripping and gritty action thriller that showcases Guy Ritchie's signature style of fast-paced storytelling, witty dialogue, and stylish visuals. The film stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Sergeant John Kinley, a U.S. Army soldier who recruits and befriends Ahmed (Dar Salim), an Afghan interpreter with a personal vendetta against the Taliban. When their platoon is ambushed in the desert, Ahmed saves Kinley's life by dragging him through the mountains, evading the enemy. Years later, Kinley learns that Ahmed is still in danger and decides to go back to Afghanistan to rescue him, defying his superiors and risking his own life.\n\n\"The film is a thrilling ride that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats with its intense and suspenseful action sequences and emotional stakes. It also explores the themes of friendship, loyalty, courage, and sacrifice in the context of war and its aftermath. The film does not shy away from depicting the harsh realities of war and its impact on both soldiers and civilians, but injects some humor and humanity into the dark situations.\"\n\n\n\"The film's strong performances by the lead actors, who have great chemistry and charisma on screen, elevate its emotional impact. Gyllenhaal delivers a nuanced and compelling portrayal of Kinley, a soldier grappling with PTSD and survivor's guilt while exhibiting compassion and determination. Salim is equally impressive as Ahmed, a complex and conflicted character who finds hope and courage in his friendship with Kinley despite having lost everything to the war. Additionally, the supporting cast does a solid job, particularly Alexander Ludwig as Kinley's rival Sergeant O'Brady, Antony Starr as Kinley's former friend Eddie Parker, and Emily Beecham as Kinley's wife Caroline. The impressive cinematography by Ed Wild captures the stunning landscapes of Spain, which double as Afghanistan, and the gritty urban settings of the U.S., while the dynamic score by Christopher Benstead blends traditional Afghan music with modern electronic beats to create a fitting soundtrack for the film.\"\n\nThe Covenant is a well-made and entertaining action thriller that showcases Guy Ritchie's skills as a filmmaker and storyteller. The film offers a thrilling and emotional journey for its characters and its audience, with some memorable scenes and performances. The film may not be very original or profound in its depiction of war and its consequences, but it is still an engaging and enjoyable watch for fans of the genre.",

Guy Richie films it smartly with excellent use of drone cameras and the moments of peril feel very real.  The tension is very real and Jake Gyllenhaal is terrific as the lead.  His Afghan co-star is very, very believable and carries the film equally.  For lighter moments the soldier to soldier banter plays well to decrease tension but sets a good stage for a surprise battle that is just around the corner.  This film is reminiscent of Lone Survivor from the battlefields.",

And the last quote on the last scene is just heartbreaking, but very true. Many lost their life. Others are living in a cave. All for what? The US of A. Great (eye roll). But the movie targets and hits good point! Felt like it was only like a 40 minute movie there was so much anticipation and eagerness.",

Kinda of a over colored, action shot, intense music type of movie. Story plot is great, and a lot of intense moments that seem a little unrealistic. Almost as if a call of duty mission was made into a movie. Wait until it comes out on your tv. Go watch the Nike air movie instead",
