But the truth of what they did is concealed from subsequent generations. More than 100 years later, Elizabeth Williams (Maggie Grace), whose family lives in Antonio Bay, returns just as a statue in tribute to the founders is to be unveiled. When a mysterious fog rolls in, Elizabeth and her boyfriend (Tom Welling) soon discover it has vengeful supernatural powers.",

The direction gives you exactly what you expect without ever really pulling you in. It's serviceable as a film but lacking on anything resembling horror.",

This uninspired remake has a bigger focus on the backstory of how the town of Antonio Bay was founded, but none of what made The Fog (1980) great. It's unfortunately another boring example of why you don't need to remake a film that is already good or has achieved a cult-like fandom. \n\nThere was a clear opportunity at the end of the original to continue the story, but sadly Wainwright was tasked with directing a regurgitated and embellished version of the original. I wanted to like it because Carpenter produced while Debra Hill updated the story, but why was it made at all?\n\nMaggie Grace is a poor substitute for Jamie Lee Curtis as Elizabeth.",

This fell victim to over complicating something as simple as lethal fog, which is probably why the original works so well - it didn't over complicate it.  Also, there's just something better about horror when it's happening to dirty looking old people with bad haircuts and shitty cars.  Oh, they gave us pointless flashbacks instead.  This is just The Fog in name only.  At least watch the original before this, so you can see the difference for yourself.",

I, honestly, don't think it's quite that awful but I fully understand the dislike this has. For me, it wastes a good concept.\n\nI actually don't mind the special effects, sure they aren't anything amazing but I never really felt let down by them; the only times it bothered me, in truth, was when there's a huge bundle of fog. For the \"natives\", though, I thought they looked fairly neat.\n\nThe film definitely goes on for too long, while the ending is terrible. Acting wise I think it's OK. Tom Welling (Nick) and Maggie Grace (Elizabeth) are passable, the rest of the cast give pretty lame performances granted.\n\nBad, but not *that* bad in my opinion. Remakes always tend to make people more annoyed, especially when they've seen the original. I haven't, so I guess that plays a part.",

Now I can't compare this to the original since I haven't seen that, but you could still distinguish this from being an abomination when compared to most horror flicks.\n\nThis film already had lost points with me being that it's a horror remake. I despise remakes. This was no different. This was not scary and the story isn't suspenseful. Hell, I'm watching an episode of the kid's series Goosebumps and I'm sh**tting my pants compared to this. \n\nAlso the characters are annoying. I've noticed of late that I'm drawn to stories that have interesting characters rather than a compelling story. Everyone though is a walking stereotype with nothing in their brain. They make stupid decisions, some are sexualized, and I don't care for any of them. it also didn't help that the acting was bad for a horror film (I don't know how much that says about the horror film).\n\nThis movie just seemed like another lazy remake of a better (supposedly) horror film trying to grab your wallet. From the CGI to the story and everything in between \"The Fog\" is pretty lackluster.",

There's nothing surprising in the film and there's very few actual scares throughout it; it's mostly a story of scorned lepers coming back for revenge against the descendents of those who wronged them, albeit in ghostly form.

Certainly not one of Carpenter's best, but definitely not his worst. With that being said, did we really need a remake to a film that was already classified as some-what mediocre? I finally caught this film to see what all the fuss was about. This does more than not doing justice to Carpenter's original. It flat out insults it. I hate how most modern day horror remakes try to go deeper into the story of a film that had such a basic premise. This film tries way too hard to be edgier than the original (kind of hard to do since it's PG-13) by exploring the history of the ghostly murderers. What results is a terrible story with barely anything interesting to redeem it. The pacing in this film is awful. Most of the film is incredibly slow and by the time some action finally does happen, there's only about 10-15 minutes left in the movie. The actors ranged from average to annoying. I absolutely couldn't stand one character, Spooner, because he was trying so hard to be \"hip\" and \"cool\" for the younger audience. The effects for this film were also pretty bad. It may seem like I'm a bit disjointed in this review, but that's because there's so much wrong with this film that it's hard for me to transition between everything. This film is all around stupid and completely pointless. The ending to this has to be one of the worst I've ever seen in horror movie history. Please, for the love of god, avoid this film like the plague. It had an interesting first 2 minutes, but everything afterwards was just bad, stupid, and a pitiful excuse for a horror movie.",

            "content": "The Fog remake of 2005 might be the worst horror remake out there and that is saying a great deal.  There are dozens of bad horror remakes out there like the remake of Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Prom Night, Psycho, etc., but at least they had some degree of effort put into them.  Those remakes, as bad as they are, at least tried to do something different and to be entertaining, but this film has almost nothing going for it.  The Fog is a classic horror film, as well as one of my favorite horror movies of all time, and I am saddened that they treated it so poorly with the remake.  This movie has almost no good actors, no good performances, no scares, no suspense, no atmosphere, and no entertainment value.\nThe story is pretty much the same as the original.  100 years ago a group of leopards came to the town of Antonio Bay, California to set up a colony.  However, the townspeople tricked them into crashing their ship and drowning.  Now these leopards have returned to get their revenge aided by a supernatural fog.\nWhere do I begin describing what is wrong with this film.  The film has no good characters and hardly any good casting save two.  Tom Welling and Maggie Grace are in this film.  I am a fan of Tom Welling through Smallville and Maggie Grace through Lost and, honestly, they're the only saving grace, but neither of them is given anything to do and the script does not let them show off their acting talent at all.  All the other characters are basic horror film stereotypes like the token comic-relief black guy.  Most of these characters are just here to be used as cannon fodder.  The original film had interesting characters with great actors playing them, while this has nothing.\nThe worst thing about this film is that it is ungodly boring.  The original film had a great atmosphere, but there is no atmosphere to speak of here.  It is not even remotely scary.  I kept waiting for a scary moment but it never came even at the end.  The score was nothing, while the score in the original is very memorable.  The ghosts are not remotely scary, mainly because they are all bad CGI.  The CG in this film is some of the worst I have seen.  Even the fog is CGI.  In the original the ghosts were all silhouettes and done all practically.  Everything was done with practical effects, while here everything is horrible CGI.\nThe messed up the story really bad as well.  First of all we are told that the leopards were killed in 1880, but in the present time we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of Antonio Bay even though the film clearly takes place in 2005.  So the makers of the film cannot even tell time right.  The ghost's motivations are really weird as well.  We assume they came back for revenge like in the original, but it does not seem like it.  At the end of the film the head ghost (spoiler) turns Maggie Grace into a ghost then they all leave (spoiler end).  So the ghosts did not even get their revenge.  The ending makes absolutely no sense.\nOverall, this film is complete garbage and a spit in the face to the original.  Skip it at all costs and just watch the original.  I would recommend any horror remake over this honestly.",

Not only is the cast bad but also the writing is even worse than the original. There is no attempt to add depth to these characters; many of them are intentionally annoying. The original made you care a little bit about all of the characters, where as this movie wrongfully intends the audience to cheer the murderous fog on. Perhaps the biggest disappointment is how the new high budget special effects are wasted. John Carpenter understood how to use lights, music, and camera work to set an ominous mood and built suspense very well in the original, it was actually the strong point of the movie. Rupert Wainwright has more tools at his disposal but fails time after time to generate suspense, which can build into a stronger form of scare. This was a disaster; it misses the mark in every way. I hoped that this could right some of the problems with the story, but it only made everything worse. Steer clear of this and just watch the original instead.",

            "content": "This is my review of The Fog (2005). I won't be telling the story much because I will be making a lot of comparisons instead of actually telling a proper review. While the original The Fog (1980) was creatively edgy, darkly spooky, the music was scary as shit and one of John Carpenter's most classical pieces of work amongst Halloween, The Thing (1982) and Escape From New York even though John said himself this was his least favourite work because he had to do so many cuts and re-shoots of the film; even though, it was still a great ghost story and one of the best. Now we get this horribly stupid, lousily written, lazily directed annoying soundtrack and dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb wasted talent of actors and actresses. Not many people liked nor even watched the original movie and even though they did, they weren't a big fan of it and turned the film into a cult classic. This film however, deserves all the hatred it needs and for my god, I don't think the director has even seen the original. He just skimmed past certain scenes and thought he can recreate it without any sense of talent. Furthermore, whilst the original was a R rated professional horror movie, this basterd director was trying to aim for a teen horror film- FUCK YOU...Whoever you are! Even the poster looks fucking retarded! It just looks like a ghost version of Ghostface: You see, you keep making me bitch about how bad this movie is over and over again. How could you make a remake of a scary ghost movie so scarily unscary? And the ending was just awfully lame to finish off. I want to punch this director in the face for creating such trash. Selma Blair from the two Hellboy movies is wasted in this movies and Maggie Grace who has been in a lot of shitty movies over the years can add this to her damn list even though she was the only good thing about this movie and her shower scene. This remake is so bad that even Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes horror remakes that he produces with his company are better than this horrendousness. The Fog (2005) gets a I-don't-give-a-fuck/10. It's been ages since I gave that rating. What a disgrace this movie was!",

Not to say that the original was really scary, it wasn't, but it had great atmosphere and more importantly was for an older audience.\n\nYep you guessed it, this overly long remake is a PG-13 cert...oh good grief. The plot is of course nothing terribly scary, an old spooky sea yarn, but at least try for some genuine thrills and a creepy atmosphere. All you get is a pretty blonde boring teen screaming a lot, a token black guy, long drawn out effects which don't add anything and worse fog effects than the original!\n\nSome of the effects are nice admittedly but they aren't really needed, its like the plot, it just delves way too deep and goes on too long when it doesn't have to. A typical effect that shows the over the top nature of the production is the tsunami looking wave of fog that approaches the 'Seagrass'.\n\nDespite the plot being too long it still manages to not make a huge amount of sense right at the end. The ghost effects at the end are also laughable. A complete and utter mistake for all involved, could have been decent if made correctly but it wasn't.
