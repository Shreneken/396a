    "summary": "In the year 2055, greedy entrepreneur Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) makes a fortune with his company, Time Safari Inc., which allows millionaires to travel back to the prehistoric era to hunt dinosaurs. Strict regulations are in place so that the present is not altered. But, during one time-travel safari, a hunter steps on a butterfly and unleashes a drastic ripple effect through time. Now researcher Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) must travel back to prevent the source of the disruption.",

            "content": "A good sci-fi movie but with some flaws -- This was a decent sci-fi movie, and I've seen quite a few time travel shows. (Small spoiler here) You have time tourists who are warned that the slightest interruption in the past can cause a cascade of disastrous repercussions in the future. Here, the changes in the evolution of nature don't come immediately but instead through a series of time waves. The acting and special effects were good too.\n\nThis is certainly better than the effect in Ray Bradbury's original story \"A Sound of Thunder\", where stepping on a butterfly 65 million years ago only caused a change in the outcome of a Presidential election. Now that's too much of a stretch.\n\nMy main problem with the movie, as a scientist, is that the movie completely overlooks the mass extinction of the dinosaurs. Any interference with the evolutionary time line the travelers made during the age of the dinosaurs would have been greatly impacted by their mass extinction around 65 million years ago. However, no mention is made in the movie of the effect the mass extinction could have had on ripple effect caused by the killing of the butterfly.",

            "content": "This movie is so horrendous it makes me want to gouge my eyes out with a corroded fork. The movie  A Sound of Thunder has special effects that look like child's play compared to any other sci-fi movie. This move puts the story to shame. \n\nA Sound of Thunder was released in 2005 and was directed by Peter Hyams. The actors of this dreadful film are Catherine McCormack as Dr.Rand, Edward Burns as Travis Ryer, Wilfried Hochholdinger as Dr. Lucas, and David Oyelowo as Marcus Payne.David Oyelowo was also in the movies  Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes , Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway, and Gringo (2018) and more a lot more movies. A Sound of Thunder has a good concept but it was how they made it.\n\nA Sound of Thunder is about a company that takes people into the past via time travel and one of the time jumps something goes wrong and they don't notice until a while after they get back from the trip into the past. Travis tries to find a way to fix it.\n\nA Sound of Thunder's best moment and the only good one is when Jenny is taken by a serpent and the only reason it is good is due to the fact that the serpent looks like gyarados. The special  effects are all so cheesy it hurts to look at. The only way to fix this move is to scrap it and start over again. \n\nI would not recommend A Sound of Thunder to any one even if they read the story no one shoud have to watch this. I wouldn't even wish this upon the person i hate the most in the world.",

            "content": "Many people say \"Read the book before you watch the movie\" well if it was in regards to this story and movie i would tell you \"Read the story and burn every copy of the movie\". The fact that the movie almost never even made it to the big screen should throw up a few red flags to anyone actually looking for good coherent movie to watch.But if you can stomach two dimensional characters and almost every cliche inside of a dinosaur adventure movie you can think of be my guest.\n\t\"A Sound of Thunder\" the movie directed by Peter Hyams. With a budget of 80 million dollars beautifully shown by the horrendous special effects. Released in 2005. Main actors including Edward Burns,Catherine McCormack,and Ben kingsley who must have lost a bet and this was the consequence. \n\tMany people think this is a \"bad movie thats fun to watch\" and i agree its a bad movie but \"fun to watch' is extremely debatable. My brain was going 100 miles per hour trying to figure out what was actually happening. Almost nothing is explained properly and i honestly don't even think the writers really knew what they were doing as when you ask Dr.Rand what shes talking about she just uses big words to rush past the topic and everything goes over your head. Another thing is multiple weak story lines. I think in an attempt to make the movie more interesting they really just made it worse. Its like they tried to shove to many big ideas into one movie. They have so many cliches in this movie to like the whole corrupt business, stolen idea,and don't forget your classic genius ex-marine whos really just in it for the research. If they were trying to make it less like the book they did exactly that in the most terrible way. If i was Bradburry i would've taken back the rights and not even let them associate this movie with the book none the less let them name it after the book. \n\tLets start with our main character Travis Ryer.The classic adventure movie main character. Hes the head of the crew and is always there to shoot something or call out a random fact. Hes also just in it so he can research the dinosaurs.Then we have Dr.Rand who really thought of the whole \"jenny\" thing who is like Siri but better? Were introduced to this lovely character when shes screaming like a mad man in one of the first scenes because Hattons going to ruin the world and stole her idea blah blah blah etc. Shes the one who really is like the mastermind behind everything. Hatton is the corrupt business owner who runs the whole time safari thing. In the rest of the crew we have a doctor, a mechanic person and a camera woman.Id take the time to go over them but you wont have to worry about them. Without focusing on the after thought storylines the story comes down to this. Two men take a safari with the crew back to the dinosaur ages and step on a butterfly therefore changing the future. The rest of the movie is the crew trying to fix that immeasurable mistake with time traveling. \n\tI think one of the only things that this movie got right was the idea that wildlife and nature would be thriving without the current evolution of humans. With every time wave we see nature getting more unpredictable and vicious but whos to argue thats wrong? I mean were some of the animals and weird plant killers vines a little out there yeah of course but the idea behind it isn't really that hard to fathom. I also appreciate how the writers tried coming up with an evolution for humans but i think it was a total hit and miss. I mean when you think of evolution you think of that one weird photo with the chimpanzees slowly turning into a human but then we magically turn into fish people? Im no scientist but that doesn't add up. I honestly think the outcome would have been better if Travis had failed to time travel correctly and save the current evolution of humanity. I mean without all of the people going insane and everyone trying to shoot anything that moved that world would have been doing magnificently without the pesky little humans. \n\tWether your reading this review after you watch the movie to understand that your eyes were not lying to you and the movie truly was that bad or to see if you should watch the movie ill leave you with a little piece of advice. Grab some tylenol for the incoming headache that is \"A Sound of Thunder\" the movie.",

            "content": "A Sound of Thunder by Ray Bradbury is an amazingly well written short story. Yet the film…. It's like the Jar Jar Binks of movie history. Horribly, Stupidly, Annoyingly...Funny? With the right sense of humor and standards of course. \n\n           The short story is about a company for wealthy people to go back in time and hunt a dinosaur that was already meant to die minutes after so it would not mess up the timeline. The short story holds suspense through the entire thing. It even ends in suspense. There is no real relief. In the film, they stretched out the story and added in some hilariously unreasonable and unneeded details.\n\n              This film is hilarious..ly bad. But, if not taken too seriously, this film is amazing. To take a short story and stretch it into a 2 hour film, it was very well done especially with a limited budget. The green screen and graphics were pretty bad, but what do you expect? This film sat on the shelf for far too long. It was very enjoyable and had a very cool story line. To the realistic issues (animals like lions going extinct and the serious issues in messing with time), to the obvious plot holes and fictional creatures.\n\n              There is some cheesy comedy that you can't help but laugh at. If you walk into this film expecting graphics that would actually be available in 2055, you will not take any pleasure in watching this film. It gets to the point where there are SO many plot holes, unreasonable creatures, venomous vine thorns, and time waves that wreak havoc on the entire city, that you just have to sit back and laugh and the epic horribleness. \n\t\tI would give this movie 3 1/2 stars for the unreasonable, yet hilarious events. I would suggest this movie to a friend if they were having a bad day or if I just wanted to mess with them. Definitely not a person who takes everything, especially films, seriously. There are definitely worse movies out there. I'll cut this one some slack.",

            "content": "The movie, A Sound of Thunder by Ray Bradbury is a terrible movie. From the editing to the dialogue, it was a pitiful attempt and sorry excuse for a movie. In this review you will find out why it is a terrible movie.\n\tThe movie is, A Sound of Thunder is directed by Peter Hyams and came out in 2005. The studio, Franchise Pictures Crusader Entertainment Baldwin Entertainment Group Etic Films Forge QI Quality International. The main characters Travis Ryer (Edward Burns), Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack), Jenny Krase (Jemima Rooper), Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley), and Dr Lucas (Wilfried Hochholdinger). The movie is about a time travel machine being used for a hunting safari, and how it can affect the future drastically.\n\tThe basic plot of the movie is that Charles Hatton is a money greedy man and tricked Travis Ryer into a contract so that he must bring people on these time travel hunting parties. Sonia Rand tells them that if they continue they will cause discourse in time. Well eventually they do end up messing up and they have to try to go back in time to intercept the hunting party. \n\tA big moment in this movie that really threw me off and kind of ruined the movie for me is the bad logic behind the movie. They always go back in time to the same spot to hunt the same dino, but never meet the other hunting parties. But at the end of the movie he can stumble into their hunting party and save the day. It makes zero sense and it was kind of frustrating to watch. If the movie was consistent it would have been a lot better, just tying up those loose ends with a little dialogue would improve the movie quality drastically. If they would have taken out that excruciatingly terrible scene of the sewer monster (Which I think was a Pokémon?) and that horrible CPR attempt, they could have had a 10 minute segment near the beginning of the movie where they are explaining the time travel to the buyers and tie up all the loose ends. The movie was terrible and it had a lot of wasted potential. \n\tI do not recommend this movie to anyone unless they want to see a fine example of a waste of $80,000,000. I may sound harsh here but I think a 14 year old with 80 million dollars and Power Director could make a better movie than this studio did. All of the monsters looked like copy pasted models with bad editing. A lot of great movies came out in 2005 and this was just not one of them. Even if they didn't have the funding for good CGI the dialogue and logic was atrocious. Here is an example, Sonia says that humans would be the last affected by the time waves because we are the last to evolve, which is not true at all. I learned in 9th grade that everything is constantly evolving and the script writers must have missed that day in school. If you decide to watch this movie after this review don't expect anything special. I wonder what Ray Bradbury thought of this horrendous movie. Use the 2 hours of your life to work on something important or watch something else.",

            "content": "\"A Sound of Thunder\": smart premise, dumb movie. It's 2055 and humanity has perfected and commercialized time travel. For a significant fee, the wealthy get to hunt dinosaurs courtesy of Time Safari Inc. The trips are set under very specific rules to avoid altering history. The hunters are brought along with a team to the past, where they find an Allosaurus (a large, meat-eating dinosaur similar to the Tyrannosaurus). As it wanders in a tar pit, moments away from certain death at the hands of a volcanic eruption the team emerges from a portal. Using frozen nitrogen bullets, they kill the animal, tape the whole thing as a souvenir and return to the present. They travel on an invisible floating path (Sort of like a force field) to ensure that they do not disturb anything else because even the smallest change in the past could have titanic consequences in the future! On one such excursion, something goes wrong. The weapon held by the lead member, Travis (Edward Burns) malfunctions and in a panic, the two businessmen being escorted by the employees of Time Safari are left unattended for a few moments. Travis manages to get the weapon working again, kills the dinosaur and everyone makes it back to the present. Travis notices a day later that the present as we know it is changing. When he asks the inventor of the time machine software, Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) about it, she tells him that the only explanation for the changes and the malfunctioning computer at Time Safari is that someone has made a change in the past. The alterations are small at first but within a couple of days we've got a new species of deadly plants engulfing skyscrapers, cities being torn apart, swarms of killer insects, packs of carnivorous dinosaur descendants attacking humanity and it's only a matter of time before the human race as we know it ceases to exist completely. The team at Time Safari, along with Sonia must find a way to return to that fateful trip that went wrong and prevent whatever changed everything from happening.\nWhen you hear about the premise of the movie, it actually sounds pretty awesome. We've got a dinosaur safari, time travel, killer bugs, killer plants and some pretty high stakes. What could go wrong? The biggest flaw with the film is that it's nowhere near as intelligent as it should be and is riddled with scientific errors. There are many theories on how time travel should work but from the premise, you can tell which one this story is going with. Time travel is possible and furthermore, you can alter the past and the present without blowing up the universe or accidentally erasing yourself from history. Unfortunately, this movie plays so fast and loose with its own rules that it becomes an incomprehensible mess. Towards the middle of the movie, we learn that Time Safari actually escorts its customers to the same Allosaurus every time. Makes sense, because how many dinosaurs about to die by volcanic eruption are there really? But wait, that doesn't make any sense. Think about it. If customer A shoots down the dinosaur, then customer B would have to arrive earlier to ensure he/she can arrive before the dinosaur dies. But that would change the present because customer A would find itself in the presence of a very dead dinosaur when it arrived in the first place. If it's possible to kill the same animal over and over without affecting history, how is it possible that this one trip actually changed anything? On a side note, how lame is it that when you go back in time and shoot down a dinosaur, you're shooting down the exact same one as everybody else, under the exact same circumstances as everybody else?\nLet's move on from that moment of nonsense. Let's just say \"ok, they made a mistake, just ignore that one\". But the movie is filled with events and plot elements that make no sense. Let's say you find yourself in this situation where time is being altered.  Maybe what you would do is... travel back in time a couple of days before the trip that went wrong and prevent the whole incident from happening by making sure those guns work ok, or maybe leave yourself a note? That would be the smart thing to do, but it's not what they do in this movie! This is nonscience-fiction! Our team of geniuses decide that to change the past, they need to go back to the exact moment where things went wrong, observe it and then fix it. Seems to me that it would be way easier to just not go on the initial problematic trip than to go back in time, way back to the time of dinosaurs and risk accidentally erasing something important from history. To further demonstrate how stupid this movie is, look at the way that the changes appear in the present. When the changes happen, it's described as a \"time wave\", it's a wave of changes, ripples in history that affect each other. These changes increase in severity as more and more of these small modifications pile up and affect the flora and fauna of Earth. Humanity is suddenly stuck in a world it doesn't understand because of something that was altered in the past. We're told that humans are the last species to be affected because \"We're the last species to evolve\". Did the writer even understand how evolution works? Living things do not have a predetermined \"final evolution\" like in Pokémon. Each generation is constantly adapting to its environment as climates and food supplies change. Successful species procreate while natural selection eliminates mutations that create undesirable or inefficient designs. You can never know how something is going to evolve, it just sort of happens. Maybe if the reason we are not immediately, physically affected was that we were the cause of the change that would make sense, but this explanation just makes anyone who knows anything about biology want to dash their head against the wall. Towards the end of the film, we actually do see humanity change into something completely different from what we're used to, but it just goes on to create further problems with the plot. If humanity evolved into a race of fish-like creatures, wouldn't our civilization be... underwater instead of on land with the same cars and buildings we have now? I guess the ripples in time only affected history in a way that we still got every single development in human the past (otherwise, you know we probably wouldn't have invented the time machine in the first place).\nAside from the mistakes in science, it just isn't very cleverly set up as a story. It's the kind of film where when the whole world is coming to an end, this team of experts never think of contacting the police or the army for some help. Despite the fact that our heroes are being attacked by a flock of bat monsters and may hold the entire future of the human race in their hands, they just decide to take this mission on by themselves. This team of experts who are in no way qualified to handle the kind of action they find themselves in just decide to go gung-ho and explore the city on their own to save the universe. They're not even clever enough to carry weapons with them at all times. It's a movie where things often happen not because they make logical sense, but because the plot demands it. We get a scene were we see a woman get eaten alive by these carnivorous bugs (which never appear in the movie again). Seeing this, Travis and Sonia jump out of her apartment window, landing in a tree. This tree is as tall as a skyscraper though and the two of them must have been at least on the 10th floor. How did Travis, who initiated the jump know that the time wave that just passed was going to conveniently place a tree branch there and that they weren't going to fall to their deaths? How did later in the film, that sea monster know to break through the glass just at the right moment so it could snap up a secondary character in a dramatic fashion? How convenient is it that the hard drive powering the time machine also happens to be compatible with the particle accelerator used at the university nearby and that they can turn this particle accelerator into a time portal?\nOn top of all these problems, the special effects for this movie are terrible. You can give a lot of slack to a movie with a low budget if it's really smart or if it's older, but this train wreck was made in 2005 and the special effects look like they're from a cheap documentary about dinosaurs that aired on TV during the 90's. Right from the beginning of the movie you see the Allosaurus emerge through a forest of trees, which fall over like dry, wooden sticks without a single leaf on them. Even worse, this clip of the Allosaurus is repeated again whenever the team travel back in time so if you thought it looked bad once, here it is again, and again! In the present, the cars look needlessly futuristic. More like shoes or tissue boxes with wheels than vehicles and as our characters talk on the sidewalk, not a single one of them slows down, stops or drops off a passenger. Not only does it look cheap, but the movie is unimaginative. The \"Time Wave\" mentioned earlier is literally a wave that encircles the glove and makes changes to the environment. The way we are introduced to this time wave is completely nonsensical by the way. Sonia tells him to look out the widow and he sees it pass through the city. Apparently she has psychic powers that allowed her to know this was coming and no one noticed this enormous time-distortion passing by during the previous 24 hours. Why do the changes happen every 24 hours by the way? Do chronological anomalies work 9-5 jobs like humans do?\nThe story is filled with clichéd characters. Ben Kingsley (one again in a terrible film) plays an amoral businessman, who delights his clients with talks that would make snake-oil salesmen blush. While he is able to charge pretty much anything he wants for these trips, he is still looking to cut costs and corners... at the expense of all of humanity! Meanwhile, Sonia is the scientist that mourns her invention being used for commercial uses. Don't they see that tampering with time will eventually result in death to us all?! Maybe people would take her more seriously if she hadn't wasted countless hours programming the time machine's computer with a sassy attitude. Our main character Travis is incredibly bland. We get a few scenes early on when he tells the audience and Sonia what he's all about but quickly degenerates into a typical action hero. Everyone else, forget about them, they're about as animated as the dead Allosaurus.\nIt's a movie where humanity is unable to fight off a race of carnivorous baboon-like dinosaur descendants. These animals are not any more intelligent than you standard lion or other large carnivore but when the stuff hits the fan here, it hits it so hard the whole world forgets everything it knows and devolves (not literally) into cavemen. It's a movie that looks bad from the beginning but gets worse and worse as it goes along. In a way, it's a perfect analogy for itself. A small mistake in the beginning of the production, a single person who didn't understand the intent and ideas behind the original short story stepped in the wrong spot and created these waves of problems, which only increase as the story goes by. It would be a terrific bad movie if it wasn't for the fact that it's extremely boring to watch. You just want it to go full throttle into idiocy and become a bad action movie with killer baboon-dinosaurs but it insists on trying to have some brains. If the concept interests you, just read the short story or even watch that old Simpsons Halloween special where Homer has a time-travelling toaster. \"A Sound of Thunder\" wants to be an action-packed adventure science-fiction movie with a brain, but it's simply a bad movie.
