Definitely worth it (and strangely, an appropriate Christmas movie).",

C.R.A.Z.Y is a really affective film as it was one of the only films I've ever seen to make me really think about my own crazy existence and what life really means. Life is too love and to celebrate our indifferences. The outfits and nostalgic soundtrack are all exceedingly impressive, as are the performances and sequences set to music. Sometimes C.R.A.Z.Y is tounge-in-cheek, sometimes its heartbreaking and sometimes its surrealistic, however what can't be denied is this relatively unknown and genreless epic is quite fantastic.",

            "content": "I wasn't expecting this level of ambition. Not only do we see Zachary's story of self-discovery unfold from his birth to his mid 20s, we also see the evolution of his family and the surrounding culture from the 50s through the 70s. \n\nUnexpectedly, the movie so accurately captures the horror and humiliation a child often goes through while suffering from nocturnal enuresis, or \"bedwetting,\" when we see Zach get outed by kids at summer camp. By avoiding sleepovers, I managed to successfully keep my bedwetting known only to my immediate family, but that is where I was also shamed by my step-mother and step-brothers who lectured and teased me about being either too lazy or too chicken to go upstairs to the bathroom. My father, more nurturing in his approach but still lacking understanding, also believed it was voluntary. When I was five, a couple of years before my step-family came into the picture, he started paying me $5 for every night that I didn't wet the bed, inadvertently seeding my humiliation and confusion over whether I could fix myself if I really wanted to and why it it was that I subconsciously chose not to. Unlike 0.5-1% of adults out there and all people in the LGBT community, my developmental abnormality abruptly came to an end at age 13, confirming that assigning neurosis to my condition was absurd. Fortunately, kids are now blessed with the internet to educate themselves and even their families. \n\nThe message both me and Zachary learned is the same: do not trust people with your differences, exposing yourself will only result in further isolation and loneliness. This lesson is more acutely relevant for Zach, because he was also born with a more polarizing and permanent sexual difference that his father and society also believes are chosen behaviors, and he doesn't want to be outed again. \n\nMy biggest criticism with the film is that it seems confused and possibly ignorant about the main character's identity. When Zach is a young boy, he shows strong signs of \"gender identity disorder,\" where he only wants a baby stroller for Christmas and he dresses up in his mother's clothes, puts on makeup, and acts like a mother to his infant brother. In the next timeline transition, immediately after his summer camp bedwetting trauma, this desire and behavior disappears entirely and never returns in the film, including when we see him alone. Instead, he becomes hardened and aggressive with a strong counterculture fashion sense and discovering an attraction to men. It's as if another writer took over and switched out Zach's brain, or at least the transgendered part.",

C.R.A.Z.Y. does merit all the praise. This film pulled me right in until I was feeling like a member of the Beaulieu family. Something that completely boggles my mind... How did they get the rights to all the music? The Stones, Pink Floyd, David Bowie?  The artists must have really wanted to have their music associated with the film. Just one of those big mysteries. C.R.A.Z.Y. has some very important things to say about family and acceptance.",

The older brother is a tough guy, drug dealing player that bangs chicks and rides motorcycles.  The younger brother is softer, in touch with his feelings, is confused about his sexuality, and needs his brother to protect him from bullies.  As the brothers grow up, life becomes complicated as the younger brother starts understanding his direction in life.\n\n\"Try to trust your feelings.  You can feel things others can't.\"\n\nJean-Marc Vallee, director of Loser Love, The Young Victoria, and the upcoming Demolition and Dallas Buyers Club, delivers C.R.A.Z.Y.  The storyline for this picture is very well written and contains wonderful characters and a great script.  The acting is excellent and the cast includes Michel Cote, Marc-Andre Grondin, Danielle Proulx, Emile Vallee, and Pierre-Luc Brillant. \n\n\"That's it.  Go kill yourself.\"\n\nI heard about this film about 7 or 8 years ago from a coworker who saw it at a film festival.  I honestly never thought I would get a chance to see it...but there it was on Netflix.  I thought this film was awesome.  The character development and portrayals were right on point.  I strongly recommend seeing this film and would place it in the same light as Stand by Me and other great coming of age pictures.\n\n\"All I can say is that I got a surplus of male hormones.\"\n\nGrade: A",
