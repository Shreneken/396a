There's a bit TOO many characters, and too many subplots that leave most of the characters insights and stories underwritten. I would have loved to see more of Sandra Bullock's character and what makes her tick, and a bit more of a conclusive arc with the Matt Dillon story. But what I did see had it's racial tensions, it's violence and it's neverending cycle to keep me interested in this story though. Is it good? Yeah. But again, this aint no Brokeback Mountain.",

In reality, Crash has more value than any Oscarbait since 2004 in terms of \"solving the racism\" theme. Partially, of course, because Crash doesn't pretend it has answers or spend a bizarre amount of time moralizing. What's more important is that movies like Crash can not be made in today's environment. The unapologetic racism and insults would not fly in today's PC media sphere. Sure, it's overall message is as sappy as they come. The eternal woe that people cry about when it comes to race relations. If only we could place ourselves in each other's shoes. The movie, however, refuses to single out anyone in particular, and all the characters do indeed go through some kind of change. It is up to the viewers to decide whether it is fitting or even redeemed anyone of anything. \nThe plot itself is a spaghetti of interconnectedness. It's full of set-ups and pay-offs. Some you can see a mile away. Some come as a genuine surprise. Several are silly in the matter of their presentation, for example Pena's one with the blanket. Apparently, filmmakers were proud of it enough to put the scene on the poster, but it's really laughably bad, from pacing to acting. Some of the characters feel left out, not getting enough screen time. Thandiwe Newton overacts in almost every scene.",

The interwoven storylines and intriguing characters keep things interesting for a while, but the whole thing is so heavy-handed (practically all of the scenes either start or end with a racial conflict of some sort) and pedantic (virtually every scene preaches the same message – races need to understand and respect each other) that it eventually becomes a pretty significant chore to slog through its never-ending repetitiveness. While there are a handful of decent performances from the all-star cast, most of the film is sabotaged by the trite and predictable dialogue and the embarrassing performance of Matt Dillon as a racist police officer.  How this won the Oscar for best picture remains a baffling mystery almost twenty years later.",

It may not have aged as well as expected, and not in the ways we may expect. There's no denying we still live in racially charged times. But co-writer/director Paul Haggis crafted a fascinating exploration of racism and bigotry in the City of Angels, the ways we can pre-judge each other and sometimes fail to see each other as human. The film is a plea for empathy, and while it may lack more nuance and complexity, it still finds ways to move us. A big part of that is the cast. All the players--save for a lightweight Brendan Fraser--are terrific. Standouts include Thandiwe Newton, Terrence Howard, and a volcanic Matt Dillon. So while it may not have been the best picture of 2005, it certainly was a provocative and emotional drama that got people talking.",

It also views racism from an individual's perspective, not so much from a systemic perspective which I think is a key piece mostly absent here.

Two black car jackers who use their race as an excuse to act stupidly. A pair of seemingly racist police officers, one embracing this and the other pushing it deep down. A black cop with a drugged out mother who blames him for the criminal nature of his brother. An East Asain man being run down in the streets and left for dead. A disconnected Persian man who differences clash with an hispanic handyman. All these walks of life with their stories intertwined in such an incredible way just going to show that even in a city as vast as that we're all bound to crash into one another. \n\nSet in the backdrop of a justice system plagued by a racist ideology behind closed doors and a usual unspoken but very real fact of the matter. Even those who don't project racism so obviously are still usually so blinded it comes off subconsciously. A beautiful piece of cinematography backed by an even stronger soundtrack that fits well. This film also has a tremendous ensemble  cast that flows together very well. This film displays racial differences without reservation and very bluntly.

            "content": "Paul Haggis' two-hour episodic film shocked everyone at the 2006 Academy Awards when it won the top prize for Best Picture against the more highly rated Brokeback Mountain. Since that controversy, the thriller hasn't aged too well and is considered the biggest mistake in Academy history. Over the course of 48 hours, Crash follows fifteen residents of the US metropolis Los Angeles who have different social statuses. But they all have one thing in common: they are perpetrators and victims of widespread xenophobia, institutional racism and sexual assault.\n\nAs ambivalent as the film's plot may be, its broad-based ensemble is convincing all along the line. Each of the fifteen actors has his or her own story, which is told over many longer and shorter sequences. Particularly ambiguous is that of Matt Dillon's character Sergeant John Ryan. Actually a cold-blooded racist and obvious woman-molester, in private he is a son who cares for his sick father. He is aware of his cruelty and it seems as if he doesn't know any other way to help himself. The same is true of Ryan Phillippe as Officer Tom Hanson, a young police officer who at first doesn't understand his partner's actions towards black-skinned people before becoming prejudiced against this group himself. Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton, as an elite black couple, show what a traumatic event can do to you. They are seen in the most upsetting and volatile scenes, acting with great emotion and visible desperation. Chris Bridges and Don Cheadle are seen in very different roles, one keeping his head above water with criminal activities, while the other is a detective struggling with white supremacy in his profession and additional family problems. Although they never meet directly, the two have more in common than one might think. Michael Pena is protective as a family man struggling to make ends meet as a handyman in wealthy households and is the highlight of the film in one particular scene. Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser are an upper-class couple who, in all their self-absorption, experience moral lessons.  \n\nFirst of all, it has to be said that Paul Haggis has good intentions with this film. He wants to present people with a realistic picture of the social situation in the USA, in which racism is clearly at the forefront, especially in connection with police violence. Other serious issues such as xenophobia, sexism and crime are also very much in focus. It doesn't read badly on paper, it just fails in its realisation. Without Haggi's handsome direction and the film's beautiful imagery, Crash would only be a below-average film. Some scenes are problematic and morally indefensible in the slightest. People are portrayed in a good light even though they don't deserve it. In addition, there is a lack of realism, which is an absolute necessity in a film with this theme. A stringing together of events in which all the characters at once demonstrate a connection? It may do justice to an episodic film, but that doesn't really add up to anything. Crash is a pretentious film that, despite a good premise and a fitting ensemble, has misconstrued its aim.",

Sergeant John Ryan (Matt Dillon) and his partner Officer Tom Hansen (Ryan Phillippe) pull over an SUV being driven by director Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton), who was performing fellatio on him. After an intoxicated Christine mouths off to Ryan, he subjects the couple to a body search. Ryan molests Christine in front of her husband and Hansen, who watches in disgust. Ryan releases them with a warning after Cameron apologizes. In the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter hit a Korean man while passing a parked van, dump him in front of a hospital, and drive away. Daniel's next call is to replace a lock at Farhad's shop, but when Daniel warns Farhad that the real problem is the door, Farhad won't listen. The next day, Farhad finds that his store has been wrecked and defaced with graffiti. Waters, while having sex with Ria, gets a phone call from his mother with dementia which leads to an argument about Ria's ethnicity. Waters later visits his mother, who asks him to find his missing younger brother. Ryan comes across a car accident and as he crawls into the overturned vehicle, he finds Christine trapped. Although she resists frantically at first, with the help of his partner and spectators, Ryan pulls the terrified Christine out just as her car bursts into flames. Anthony and Peter carjack another Navigator, which happens to be Cameron's. Only after opening the door do they realize that Cameron is black. Police officers arrive on the scene and a chase ends with Cameron and Anthony in Cameron's car on a dead end residential street. Hansen is one of the pursuing officers and, out of guilt for the part he played in the assault of Cameron's wife, vouches for Cameron to be let off with a warning. Cameron expresses shame toward Anthony for his criminal lifestyle and drops him off near a bus stop...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"A raw and unsettling morality piece on modern angst and urban disconnect, Crash examines the dangers of bigotry and xenophobia in the lives of interconnected Angelenos.\" Roger Ebert gave the film 4/4 stars and described it as \"a movie of intense fascination\", listing it as the best film of 2005. The film also ranks at #460 in Empire's 2008 poll of the \"500 Greatest Films of All Time\". Some later reviews of Crash have been less favorable. Cultural critic Ta-Nehisi Coates criticized the film as shallow and \"unthinking,\" naming Crash \"the worst film of the decade.\" The film has been critiqued for depicting the Persian shopkeeper as a \"deranged, paranoid individual who is only redeemed by what he believes is a mystical act of God.\" The film has also been criticized for using multicultural and sentimentalist imagery to cover over material and \"historically sedimented inequalities\" that continue to affect different racial groups in Los Angeles. In 2010, the Independent Film & Television Alliance selected Crash as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years. The film can be used as an example of the so-called 'network narrative', a non-linear way of storytelling that highlights the contingency of life and values the structure of society over the individual. The disconnect and conflicts portrayed in the film are highlighted by its unusual structure and present the possibility of the portrayed racism and bigotry being a result of structural behaviour that partially neglects the individual perspective and creates an abstract scale.\n\nPaul Haggis \"Crash\" from 2004 which he produced, directed, and co-wrote has a great character palette intertwining within the story and it´s still such a blow to the stomach when watching it. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the directing, screenplay, performances (particularly from Dillon), but earned polarized responses for its depiction and portrayal of race relations. The film earned several accolades and nominations. Dillon was particularly praised for his performance and received Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor. Additionally, the cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. The film received six Academy Award nominations, and controversially won three for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Film Editing at the 78th Academy Awards. It was also nominated for nine BAFTA awards, and won two, for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Thandie Newton. It´s strong, gripping, emotional, thoughtworthy and difficult. We get great acting, great direction and a great ensemble cast with Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Ludacris, Terrence Howard, Thandie Newton and Ryan Phillipe. There´s also a beautiful character development as they all go through a personal metamorphosis landing in a common conclusion which succeeds at being both cathartic and unsettling as someone else wrote at IMDB. I love this film.",

            "content": "Crash is another one of those movies that interweaves separate stories that have one or more settings, center on multiple themes, and explore invisible links between individuals. Most of the themes explore racism, crime, social interactions, and redemption. One story involves a Hispanic door handle repairman Daniel (Michael Peña) whose customer Farhad (Shaun Toub) has gone on a vengeful grudge against him when his shop has been vandalized and burgled. Another story, Jean (Sandra Bullock) and Rick (Brendan Fraser) file a report of their car being jacked by two criminals Anthony (Ludacris) and Peter (Larenz Tate) and become increasingly fearful of their lives. Yet another story, Peter's brother Detective Graham (Don Cheadle) and his partner Ria (Jennifer Esposito) investigate a hate crime involving a police officer who supposedly killed a black man. Still another thread, Officer John Ryan (Matt Dillon) searches for redemption as he rescues a woman Christine (Thandie Newton) from a burning car, that same woman whom he violated in front of her husband, a TV director Cameron (Terrence Howard), during interrogation the other night. Despite the brilliant match-cut editing, the terrific performances (particularly from Newton, Dillon, and Toub), and audacity to portray different angles of racism, the dialogue is hit-and-miss, ranging from clever to preachy and pretentious and, as mentioned before, the story structure is not unique, especially compared to other films like Intolerance, W.R. Mysteries of the Organism, and, most akin, Magnolia and Short Cuts. I wish Farhad wouldn't refer to every action around him to be an evil omen or Michael's daughter to be an ‘angel'. I know each story has to have a redemptive epiphany, but this child prophecy imagery is too cliched and sentimental and makes the writing more pretentious. For all its sins, Crash is still a decent brooding depiction of Los Angeles, but I've seen much better, more powerful and better written. \n\n(3 ½ Invisibility Cloaks out of 5)",

A few of the individual storylines do carry some impact, but others have such a boldfaced lack of both nuance and power as to drag the entire project down the tubes. How this was ever considered a piece of serious filmmaking, I'll never guess; it's an interesting premise that was ultimately assembled with a great cast and high production values but the script and feel of a student film trying to be edgy for its own sake.

Five minutes into this film I realized that all criticisms I had read were valid and in my attempt to watch every Best Picture winner I have realized that several terrible films have been rewarded. This is not one of the worst because it contains good performances, can be emotionally engaging at times and was entertaining in how bad it was but it isn't a film that I'd recommend for the reasons that the filmmakers clearly wanted me too. Brokeback Mountain (2005) was robbed of a Best Picture win and although 2005 was a dark year for cinema that are many, many films more deserving of the award than this.\n\nUsing the very popular mid-2000s plot device of having disparate lives brought together by tragic circumstances with an overarching theme of racism going both ways? African Americans Anthony, Ludacris, and his friend Peter, Larenz Tate, decide to steal the car of wealthy white Americans Jean, Sandra Bullock, and District Attorney Rick, Brendan Fraser. Racist police officer John, Matt Dillon, sexually assaults Christine, Thandie Newton, after pulling her and her husband Cameron, Terrence Howard, over on bogus charges. He is sympathetic however because his father faces an illness that may be prostate cancer and an African-American social worker Shaniqua, Loretta Devine, refuses to help him. Hispanic- American Daniel, Michael PeÃ±a, is employed by Persian shop owner Farhad, Shaun Toub, to fix his locks but when a breakdown in communication occurs Farhad blames Daniel when a robbery occurs later. Detective Graham, Don Cheadle, can be seen investigating a seemingly unrelated crime throughout that turns out to be connected to Officer Tom, Ryan Phillipe.\n\nThe dialogue that the actors are asked to spout in this is ridiculous as we hear Sandra Bullock give a speech in which she says \"Amigo\" and \"Homie\" with no self-awareness as the film tells us that this is deadly serious. The amount of times that white people, living in the very multicultural Los Angeles, spout on about how bad black people are to black people is simply ridiculous. Yes, blatant racism is still a problem but in 2004 you would expect more subtle forms of racism to have a bigger effect on the day to day lives of African Americans. The film attempts to say that reverse racism exists and that because we don't know that a racist cop is facing taking care of his dying father but nobody feels at all real so the moments of emotional poignancy do not work. I found myself laughing at what were meant to be the most affecting scenes in the film because everything on screen felt so utterly misjudged I couldn't even take the prospect of a child being shot and killed seriously.\n\nThe bright spots of the film were the performances, Howard, Newton, Dillon and even Phillipe do a great job and if they were present in a better film then I could have properly appreciated their work. The cinematography makes gestures at trying to capture both the beauty and the rough atmosphere of Los Angeles but having recently seen Heat (1995) and Mulholland Drive (2001) I was underwhelmed. The film ends up not really capturing anything accurately as we jump from the expensive mansion that Bullock and Fraser inhabit to one of the many nondescript cars that Tate and Ludacris steal. Considering what a hot button issue racism was in 2004 and still is today I would have hoped that some part of this film could provide an accurate, detailed depiction of the contemporary issues that people of different races face in interacting with one another.\n\nI don't understand how this movie fooled everyone in 2004/2005 because respected critics like Roger Ebert and Christy Lemire didn't seem able to understand how ridiculous this film's approach to racism was. At least Driving Miss Daisy (1989) treated Morgan Freeman's character with respect and the dialogue that Tandy received allowed her to deliver lines that didn't sound patently absurd. This is not up there with The Life of Emile Zola (1937) beating Make Way for Tomorrow (1937) in 1938 but Brokeback Mountain (2005) is an objectively better film than this.",

It was said this was a film that made us seriously look at who we were really were on the inside, challenging our internal perceptions.\n\nThe story follows several characters throughout a disturbing group of events all involving racially charged situations. We get everything from a racist perverted cop, a clean young self-righteous cop, yuppie victims of a break in, a mixed race couple in which one is racist against the others race, and a few more. The actors do a very good job but fall victim to an overloaded film. It is hard to find time to care for any of these characters plights when there is no time to really get to know them. The best example is when there is an attempt to make us sympathize with the racist cop. We have seen several instances of his disgusting behavior and that is it when suddenly we get a sob story about his father. While this is not a bad concept it is meaningless in this film because we know nothing of this character except that he is a jerk and the sudden family story seems cheap and fake. It is especially cheap when this story is the one and only time we see this personal weakness. Most the other stories follow suit making the film a series of cheap and emotionless shock spots.\n\nThis leads into the greatest flaw with this film. I have lived in many different places in the USA. Blatant racism is not an issue in this country and wasnâ(TM)t when this film was made.  The most common form of racism in this country, aside from diminished expectations, is subtle assumptions people make.  Black people all play basketball.  All Asians are good at math.  All white people are wealthy suburbanites.  All Hispanics are Mexican who arrived yesterday.  These things donâ(TM)t make us see people as good or bad but are just foolish assumptions.\n\nCrash wished to confront people with its multiple stories. The failure comes in that each situation is over the top. Each story presents us with a situation which easily disgusts us and makes us see how clearly wrong the act is. As I listened to others after the movie had ended most were saying how they could never imagine being like the characters they had just seen. It is too easy for the average person to walk away from this film saying \"Wow, I am so glad I am not like that\" because the average person is not like that.\n\nCrash needed to follow two specific people involved in a confrontation of the subtle issues each of us face not the extremes that shock us. The shock must come from the realization that I am just like this person who I have learned holds things they never knew.\n\nCrash is a failure and cheap stylized social commentary. It is sad that so many hold this film as a great commentary on racism. If anything this film continues to allow people to ignore what they might be holding close and hidden.",

Sadly, the end result didn't come out so good. The first big flaw in the movie is that basically all the characters are one-dimensional. No one has any nuance, and you realize within seconds of meeting them whether they are \"good\" or \"bad\". Perhaps the best example of this is Sandra Bullock, who plays a horrendous woman that no one would want to interact with at any time from the first moment she opens her mouth. There's very little progression in the story for any of the characters either. Sure, they endure difficult events, but almost no one is actually changed in any significant way. At best we see people are forced to confront their own prejudice, but each individual story cuts off as soon as they reach that point of clarity and we don't see any after effects or growth. This is the part of Crash that bothered me the most, it didn't seem to have a point. I mean, is the point that racism still exists in 2004 L.A.? As if anyone doesn't know that. Perhaps the point is that everybody is racist in some ways, and every race is discriminated against by someone? If that were the case we'd need more authentic characters we could relate to in order to see our own prejudices thrown in our faces. Also, the movie doesn't suggest a way of healing or moving past our prejudices, it just portrays racism as a natural phenomenon that cycles around and will never end. Crash even botches the most powerful moments by obviously foreshadowing them for us, so I wasn't impacted emotionally. It's a bad film made by misguided people who somehow made their point in a way that the Academy appreciated, but I did not.",

In this review, I will not be talking about the Oscar, but the film itself. In my opinion, I don't think crash is a terrible movie, but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, and I am going to explain why. \"Crash, a film about racial equality told thru multiple different people with their own racial problems in Los Angeles, is a incredibly descent movie, despite its Oscar baiting topic. The movie is filled with fantastic, beautiful, and incredible performances from the star studded class. Despite the actors not having a whole lot to work with, they still turn out great performances. I especially mind those of Sandra Bullock, who plays a white rich woman, and Matt Dillion, who plays a racist cop. Despite the actors not having a whole lot to work with, they still deliver fantastic performances, doing their best to make the characters feel real. I also mind \"Crash\" beautiful and intense scenes. There are a handful that stand out. Those scenes are composed of perfect editing, beautiful chorography, and fantastic writing from Paul Haggis's Screenplay in order to make a dramatic scene twice as dramatic and intense. But the thing that stands out to me, is the films message at the end. Despite all of the challenges the characters have went thru, the film delivers a ending message that is memorable, mature and realistic. And a good film must always have a great message towards it, and \"Crash\" message, is great. However, every film is not without its critism, and Crash is a film worthy of critism. For starters, the films characters mostly rely on their racial equality to the Carrie the film out, and their racial equality is an incredibly cartoonish and steypytical Hollywood look at race, rather it being immigration, African American steyotrypes, or even the characters economical class. The film could of done something different with the characters race, but instead comes off in a typical Hollywood offensive delevry. Another thing about the film that really piss me off, is how those perfect scenes I mention that perfect because of its editing, chorography, timing, patients, acting, music and most importantly writing, are then butchered up at the end of the scene to give us a satisfying ending, the audiences wont have to worry about, and instead feel better about our self's. This is incredibly stupid, because your wasting your time on perfect team work, and end it with a pointless meaning. Instead of making it memorable, the filmmakers instead make it pointless and meaningless, even if it well make the film incredibly sad. If you want to do something memorable, look at the ending of Do the Right Thing. So at the end of the day, Crash is a Okay movie that I recommended you go see. The film has great acting, descent writing, and memorable scenes. However, I still give it a mix review and a 2.5/5 stars.",

            "content": "\"Look at me. You embarrass me. You embarrass yourself.\"\n\nAnd I thought Nightcrawler put me off L.A....Jesus...\n\nSo Crash opened up very rocky I must say. As an introduction for characters, Crash literally crashes. Don't expect anyone with a clear good side apart from perhaps Michael Pena. It's difficult to open your film like this, and still pull it back to make a solidly dramatic movie.\n\nDramatic moments in Crash happen at well paced times. Just as one finishes it allows you a breather to move onto the next one, a twist ant turn that will contradict your emotions and contradict your mindset towards a community standard. It's quite clear that there is a blatant underlying message of how racism isn't black and white but is infectiously universal. And how even though how prejudiced and how much pain you think you are in. Guess what? You can cause some pretty lengthy pain as well. And this is where Crash shines like gold. Some truly gulping scenes that I have no intention of talking about, go check them out for yourself.\n\nActing and cinematography was structured well. Nothing overly special, but the actors did their jobs well. Particularly from Michael Pena (Once again). He did quite bizarrely have no prejudices, and that may come under influence from his daughter. But if the film perhaps wanted to make an excuse, I would've liked to have seen a little more detail rather than following Sandra Bullocks story in the film. Yes, the same message was set for her but it seemed rushed and choppy. An almost laughable resolution which is disappointing.\n\nCrash leaves some things unsolved, perhaps some things are missing which needed to be added. But it delivers a harsh yet truthful message on racism and other hints of issues in the U.S.A such as healthcare and firearms policies. A relatively heart-pounding feat which gets better as it progresses.\n\nB\n\n70/100",

So I watched it, and I still don't know if it deserves the award.  The movie is not bad. But the directing is not the thing I will remember first. Neither the actors role - even if I enjoyed the work of few of them, such as Sandra Bullock or Don Cheadle who did the job even if they have limited screen time. I think the main problem is the number of characters. I couldn't attach to any of them but for a scene in which they are hurt or where they change their minds. \nTheir are several great moments which made me help the film during the time of the scene : the moment whith the exploding car is great, as the final scene with Sandra Bullock or the touching moments with the character portrayed by Michael Pena and his little daughter. \nThese moments make me enjoy the movie. But there are too many details that made that I can do more than appreciate this film ; I can't say it is or will be a classic, but if I can't say it deserves the awards it received, I will not make a scandal for it. This is not a great movie, but at least it is a good one in many moments. It would just have been a bit better if they would have give a larger place some figures, instead of mixing all their destinies together - but it is the goal of the screenplay and of this film, so I can't really blame them for it.",

The only real highlight of Crash's narrative is the way it intertwines the different plot lines into one cohesive narrative, and even that feels too compact for a story set in the sprawling city of Los Angeles. The ensemble cast is completely wasted, and nobody gives a truly worthwhile performance, which is odd considering the amount of talent involved. The technical aspects are fine, but even those are vanilla at best (the beauty of Mark Isham's musical score is lost through its recurring and overly dramatic usage.)

There are several moments in the film when its subject matter is laid bare and leaves you questioning just how deep-seated racism is, and that we could potentially be, by our very natures, discriminatory towards those different to ourselves. The film would succeed if this were true of the rest of the movie. Unfortunately the audience is subjected to broad characterisation, blatant stereotypes and situations that beat them mercilessly over the head with a club bearing the inscription 'RACISM IS WRONG!' For all its good intentions, Crash is depressingly shallow and artificial. I really hate to flog a dead horse, but I have to side with the many, many people who claimed that the film robbed the far more deserving Brokeback Mountain, a movie far richer, more complex and emotionally earnest, of the Best Picture Oscar. Having seen both films, I can safely say they're not even in the same league.

It starts off well by giving ample focus on the urban disconnect and the ever existing racism, but towards it has no real substantial ending and many of the stories are either pointless like Sandra Bullock's and Brendan Fraser or too preachy. The best stories in the film are that of Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton and Ryan Phillippe where each of these actors provide commendable performances. What pisses me of is the fact that Sandra Bullock is given top billing only because she is an A-list actor, not because of the importance of her role here. The film begins with a good and realistic depiction of the disconnected LA city and the racist tendencies, but it ends up satisfying all the racial groups in America(whites, blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, Chinese and all the rest) without that realistic touch (take for eg how Sandra Bullock's story ends). It is for the same reason that the film won the Oscar because it satisfies all communities by it's pseudo preachy approach. It's well filmed however with fine cinematography and editing.",

But i feel like some were put in there for serious reasons and others as a joke. Like the first seen with the asian women who got in a car crash and they were mimicking her accent and implying that all asian drivers are bad drivers. That was bad scene i feel it was only put in there for amusement and an eye opening scene was the scene where they pulled over the black couple even though that wasn't the car they were looking for and the police officers harassed them. Another scene was when the couple was getting their locks changed and the wife insisted that they get  the locks changed again because she thought the man who was changing her locks was a gang member and was gonna sell their key to someone so they could rob them she thought this because he was hispanic with tattoos. These scenes brought up a lot of issues that are a real problem in today's society. But over all i think crash helped people see the racism that is around us everyday and see how wrong it is that people of different races are being treated this way. It also showed people how they could be racist without even trying to be or how some stereotypes are completely racist. This is very good film on the topic of racism a believe it served its purpose completely. But this movie is going against racism by showing different situations with racism and how they are resolved or how they play out.",

Crash upholds racial stereotypes because they showed that no matter how a person may look or talk, those assumptions about people are not always true and can actually surprise you. People just assume that a Latino person is Mexican or that a Middle Eastern person is of a certain religion or from a certain country, when that is not always true. A person that is presumed to be a Mexican because he is Latino doesn't mean that is where he is from, where he could actually be Puerto Rican, Colombian, or Brazilian.  I personally liked the movie because I liked how realistic and how believable it came off, like situations like the ones depicted in the film could easily realistically occur. I also liked that the movie wasn't all totally serious and had some lighter points and some bits with humor as well.",

            "content": "\"Crash\" is the best movie of 2004! It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, although many critics though it was in fact the worst movie they have ever seen. In the course of 24 hours, a handful of disparate people's life intertwined as they deal with tense race obstacles. Paul Haggis's \"Crash\" hurts the dialogue on race a lot more than it helps the dialogue on race because the movie makes people think about it and to think about racism in the real world and where they stand on the situation. At the end of the movie, everyone that has survived the 24 hours learned a very powerful lesson on race and is a better person for that. \n             I think that the movie \"Crash\"  hurts the dialogue on race because more harm was done by the individuals than they did good. Robert Jensen and Robert Wosnitzer wrote to opednews.com  \"The problem is that the film can't move beyond the concept of tolerance, and tolerance is not the soution to America's race problem.\" I agree with their point on how the film can't move beyond the concept of tolerance because in the scene where Officer John Ryan molested Christine Thayer, Officer Ryan's partner, Officer Hansen didn't report the crime he witnessed, instead he tolerated it and let it slide. This scene supports my opinion because Officer Hansen saw his policeman partner Officer Ryan breaking the law as he fondle Christine and didn't report it back to the chief, instead he tolerated it and asked the police chief for a single man squad car. I would love to see how the movie would have played out if Officer Hansen would have just told Lt.Dixon that Officer John Ryan molested an innocent woman. Maybe some character(s) would still be alive at the end of the movie.\n          \"Crash\" shows the way we all leap to conclusions based on race. This statement said by Robert Ebert counters my opinion. His statement counters my opinion because he is saying that by watching \"Crash\" it shows the way we are quick on the trigger to the stereotyping gun. I think his statement is in fault because my whole time watching the film I never once stereotyped one person. In the scene where Officer Hansen picked up Peter Waters, mostly everyone watching the film assumed that Peter had a gun because he is portrayed as a \"thug\" I on the other hand assumed he was reaching for the St. Christopher statue. If Officer Hansen would have waited at least five more seconds then he wouldn't have killed Peter Waters. Officer Hansen was in fault to begin with because hitchhiking in California is illegal and he should have pulled over to pick him up.\n              \"Crash\" has multiple scenes where someone tries to make up for something racist that they have done, but fell short of compensating the other race. Robert  Jensen and Robert Wosnitzer suggested \"Isn't some attempt at an honest treatment of the complexity of the issue better than nothing?\" I disagree with Robert Jensen and Robert Wosnitzer's opinion as it counters mine because no one can be \"cleared\" or \"forgiven\" of their racist remarks or action. I think racism can not be made up for and should stick with you for the rest of your life. In the movie where Officer John Malley came to the rescue of Christine Thayer the irony was so bad you could practically taste it. The movie portrayed this scene as if Officer John Malley was cleared of his wrong doings for when he sexually assaulted Christine Thayer. Racism can not be made up for, especially if that kind of racism also involves molesting a woman of color. I think it would be better to have little to no compensation than to try to make up for something racist you said or did because it might just insult the person even more.\n             Ultimately, I believe that the movie \"Crash\" was one of the best movies I have ever seen and I am very surprised that I haven't even heard of this movie before, until we viewed it in class. \"Crash\" touches and many different sides of racism and I could see how some might get offended and think it's the worst movie that was ever made. My opinion is that Paul Haggis's \"Crash\" hurts the overall dialogue on race because the movie touches on many perspectives and conflicts of race that leaves the viewer to ask themselves questions such as \"Why did he do that?\" or \"What would happen this this didn't occur?\". This huge debate on race has a larger impact on society because it makes people think and it might even make them change their views on racism to make everyone's lives a lot more easier.",

While I must applaud the acting by the whole cast to make their character's seem beleivable and realistic what lets the entire film down is that only once did I ever feel any care or connection to the characters and the one time I did was with a very minor character. Without adding in spoliers I feel like Crash just wants to be too smart and too ground breaking for its time. I see the merit in having the range of character's each with their own personal problems that eventually all collide but I wish the aftermath would have been more expanded and indepth to truly show just how effective this crash had been on possibly changing their rascit points of views. This could of added the needed emotional punch to a story that really is in a scramble at trying to find where it should go next and it is this that turns Crash's story into a disjointed mess with very little continuity even after the film was suppose to intergrate all the stories into oen. What I did enjoy though was the dialogue and how each character has a definite select motivation and perspective on life, even if some were underutilised or had very litte overall effect on the story, or lack of. Crash is by no means an awful film but the audience should not be tricked into beleiving it is as intelligent or likeable than it tries to be, but instead focus on the merit of its acting, characters and fine use of sets.",

            "content": "The first time I saw Crash was a week ago in my Social Issues in Film FYE class. My teacher told us to pay close attention to how the characters related to each other and try to find the deeper meaning in the film. The actors and directors did an amazing job.  They delivered a film that was transparent and hardcore, yet relevant and thought provoking.  By the end of the movie, I was completely blown away.  I did not expect to be so impressed by this film.  Surprisingly, it left me pondering my own personal views on several cultural and social issues.  I went back to my dorm that day a watched it over and over again.  The three things I look for when critiquing a film is a good story line, believable characters, and sensible plot execution. \nThe story line of \"Crash is about the collision of races, cultures, and classes.\" (Lisa Schwarzbaum, 2005). The pileup begins almost immediately when two young black men are walking in an upscale white part of Los Angeles and talking about the perception of young black men in upscale white town. Then carjacks a Lincoln Navigator that happens to belong to the L.A. district attorney and his rich-bitch wife and Bam!, that's four people linked and unmasked, in all their ugliest prejudices and most shameful fears, by the fate of one SUV which will eventually have everything, to do with the fate of another Navigator, owned by a rich black TV director and his wife and stopped for inspection by a racist white cop and his partner .When they got pulled over the cop touch the man's wife inappropriately in front of his very eyes. This atomically catches my attention at how in the film, Crash's main white characters are depicted in comfortable positions, both socially and economically. Then in another scene , the television executive producer who tells Black producer Cameron Thayer (Terence Howard)  to make one of his actors speak \"more black\" because that character was \"supposed to be the dumb one.\"  In the movie most of the minority characters were portrayed as socially powerless. \"The film Crash was directed by Paul Haggis, he does a good job at showing how most people feel prejudice and resentment against members of other groups, and observes the consequences of those feelings.\"(Roger Ebert, 2005) This I can completely agree with this because the director, didn't hold back when showing the audience the true reality behind the social issue of racism\nFor me, believing in the characters helps me gain a better understanding of the film.  Whether the characters are A-list or under budget actors / actress the way they express their emotions on camera plays a major role in creating a great film. The actors and actress in this are amazing from Sandra Bullock, Ludacris Jennifer Esposito, William Fichtner and many others. Their emotions poured out through the screen, I could feel everything they felt, whether it was anger, disappointment, shame, happiness,  sadness , although I couldn't fully relate to everything presented in the film , I  could easily put myself in their shoes , all from the way they made everything feel so realistic .The characters themselves function symbolically. For example, one thing that happens, again and again, is that peoples' assumptions prevent them from seeing the actual person standing before them. An Iranian is thought to be an Arab, although the Iranians are really Persian. Both the Iranian and the white wife of the district attorney believe a Mexican-American locksmith is a gang member and a crook; however he is a family man.\" No matter how hard some of the characters try to disprove their own racial stereotype, in some way or form it becomes inevitable that they must live out the stereotype to exist in the society they live in. \" (Justin Aptaker, 2012) The characters find themselves not only stereotyping others but also living up to their stereotypes The movie Crash is unique because instead of showing characters at their best, like most popular movies do, the characters are instead stressed out and pushed to their own emotional limits.\nIf the film gets my critical and perceptive juices flowing, then it generally works for me. I want the film to leave me with something to think about. This film constantly keeps you on your toes and at the edge of your seat. There is always a twist. Everyone's life stories tie into one another rand you watch at how their actions influences not only their life but someone's life. The film sets a tone of how reality truly is this and that these things really happened. The characters in the film took me on a ride of crazy emotions, yet it managed teaches me to realize that it is never too late to redeem one's self and change. In the film there is a lack of acceptance of other cultures and unwillingness to understand why individuals are the way they are. Crash demonstrates this throughout the film through every character. This is the part of the film that made me pounder on the deeper meanings and the main point the director was trying translate.\nUltimately, I believe anyone seeing it is likely to be moved to have a little more sympathy for people not like themselves. \"Crash\" exceeded my expectations it had a relevant story line, believable characters and a thought provoking message. The movie contained hurt, coldness and cruelty, but it still leaves you feeling hopeful. In the end, the movie conveys the importance of respecting individuality, and realizing we share similar fears and hopes. You may have to look hard to see it, but \"Crash\" is a film about making personal progress in the midst of unexpected pain.",

The story follows several characters whose lives cross by racial differences in Los Angeles. The main themes of racism, cultural differences in modern day life and relationships are portrayed very strong and carry a powerful message that people can't discriminate a person by his or her color, sex and religious believes. 'Crash' won three Academy Awards in  2006, including Best Picture. Good performances by a large cast ensemble:  Sandra Bullock (Speed), Matt Dillon (There's Something About Mary), Don Cheadle (Swordfish), Brendan Fraser (The Mummy Trilogy),  Lucradis (2 Fast, 2 Furious), Thandie Newton (Mission: Impossible 2) and Ryan Philippe (Cruel Intensions).  Stop thinking black and white...\n\nOn a night out District Attorney Rick Cabot (Fraser) and his pampered wife Jean (Bullock) get carjacked by two black man (one of them played by Lucradis). When returning home Jean demands that the locks are changed by a white man and not Hispanic locksmith Daniel Ruiz.\n\nLAPD officer John Ryan (Dillon) and his rookie partner Tom Hansen (Philippe) are on patrol and pull over a car that is similar to the one stolen from the Cabots. In it are TV director Cameron Thayer and his wife Christine (Newton), who was giving him oral sex.  Hansen is shocked to see how his partner transforms into a racist asshole who molests Christine while he is searching her. \n\nPersian shop owner Farhad has asked locksmith Daniel Ruiz to repare the lock on the door. Already been robbed, he and his daughter bought a handgun to protect themselves. \n\nBlack  detective Waters (Cheadle) has to investigate a deadly gun fire between a white undercover agent and a black victim.

            "content": "The movie Crash is about the daily struggle against prejudice and racism in America. It starts off with several seemingly unrelated stories, which ultimately converge into a single crash after much deliberation. Although the clash may appear coincidental and even contrite at first, at a deeper level, the movie seems to suggest that there is no absolute coincidence, that the black guy shot in a car could as well be your lost brother, that the police officer teasing you in the last moment could as well be your savior, and that the person who insists on justice could as well be a murderer. None of the accidents should be surprising, since they are simply manifestations of the historical racism and cultural prejudice of America on a daily basis. Yet what really distinguishes Crash from other conventional movies that portray racism is the reconciliation part at the epilogue. Indeed, certain people may appear offensive upon first glance, yet the life stories behind them could be so sympathetic as well. All it needs to understand a person more holistically is to go a layer deeper, beyond what his deeds may suggest. Above everything, Crash is about contradiction, contradiction between people's surface and their hidden nature, between what a man has done and what he will do, between what things seem and what they actually are. At the end, the movie suggests that because people do change over time, racial stereotypes and even personal characterization can't always apply, yet love and compassion, the beauty of humanity, shall always persist and find their way in darkness.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the movie depicts racism mostly in the lights of average Americans, one scene particularly mesmerizing is when the wretched Chinese are released from the car by the black fellow. On the one hand, this scene greatly resembles the enfranchisement of black men in the 19th century, the only difference being Abraham Lincoln is a black man this time. From a historical perspective, this ending points out the continuum of oppression and liberation in America, and how much progress America has made and unmade since the Declaration of Independence. On the other hand, when the trafficked Chinese step outside of the car, they look isolated, dismantled and lost. Yet the reason for their deliria is not just the fact that they don't mentally belong here. The reality is that the world immediately in front of them is so stereotypically diverse and grotesquely prosperous that it elicits fear. In the 21st century, what America really needs is to not only solve the domestic issues of racism, but also accommodate immigrants against any form of nativism.\r\n\r\n***Sorry for being a little bit preachy I guess***",

Racism is definitely a problem in America (and the world), but all this film seems to have to contribute to that discussion is that it's bad. To make matters worse, every single character in the film is a stereotype. And there's also too many characters to begin with. You learn a little bit about them and their lives, but the running time didn't really allow for a deeper examination of these people and why they are the way they are. All of the performances were good, to be sure, but it was all in service of a heavy-handed script that approaches the issue of racism in the most skin-deep way possible. Despite the film's title, implying a certain degree of chance in one's encounters, every moment in the film felt calculated and calibrated for maximum emotional impact in a way that undermines the seriousness of the issues it wanted to address. At the end, no one really learns anything and, as an audience member, I was left wondering what the point was exactly. From a technical standpoint, though, the film is fairly solid. The movie is about, and (presumably) shot in, LA and the filmmakers did a good job of capturing it on film, especially in the night time. The cinematography was actually kind of beautiful, in contrast to the ugliness of the characters. I'll even give credit to the score for being relatively toned down, letting the rigged emotional stakes of the film stand out that much more. When all is said and done, I'm also left wondering how in the world this shallow nonsense ever won Best Picture. Although well-made and well-acted, it just seems like the Academy gave themselves a pat on the back for even acknowledging that racism exists.

It's never one that I've watched leisurely and I think that's a fantastic thing. Watching this movie critically from the very first time allowed me to really think while watching it and connect with several characters on a deep level. This movie is fantastically directed most of all and on one of the times watching it, I was totally focused on the directing of it. There are so many slight background images or lighting choices that if you really pay close attention and see you will notice add so so much to the film. Every single shot of this film is so intricate and so thought out to bring the story to life for just about anyone who watches it regardless of who you are or where you've been. I feel like no matter what your stance is on the subjects presented in this film, you can find at least a piece of you self in one or more of these characters, that in one film alone were all brought to life so vividly. I just want to mention that some of the my favourite performances personally were Sandra Bullock in her role as Jean Cabot. She makes her character so detestable in the beginning but becomes so vulnerable and allows the audience to see the awakening and growth that occurs. Don Cheadle also did a fantastic job bringing his character to life. Loretta Devine was a very small but very well executed role that brought a lot to the story. Thandie Newton gave an excellent performance in her role and really made me think and feel throughout the film. Ludacris played a very important role in the film because while, like all the characters, he had a story to tell and a way of thinking to observe, he made comic relief possible in an otherwise very heavy film. Ryan Phillippe was enjoyable in the film as someone that at first presents himself in one way but we later learn has his flaws as well. Ashlynn Sanchez also did a great job as the piece of innocence in the film. All the actors did a great job and I wish I had the time to comment on them all but I would simply recommend watching for yourself and taking the chance to connect with each character as they experience their lives and learn their lessons. A fantastic film!",

Set in LA and starring a wealth of well known actors, it follows the lives of several different individuals, with various backgrounds, lifestyles, and more importantly, ethnicities. At first, watching the scenes flip from one story to the next was very frustrating with it becoming hard to grasp any fluency with the concept, other than the fact that black people were being treated as the aggressive race, with little respect shown for them. However, as the individuals began interlinking with one another's lives, and how one persons actions would shape another's, the clever approach this film had actually pieced together was somewhat entertaining. Clearly intent on portraying messages with regards to race equality in today's society, the events soon lead one to wondering whether people can all be judged on appearance or first impressions. Whom we perceive to be the good cop and bad cop are soon brought into debate quite literally in the scenarios the director has placed onto our screens in this finely staged spectacle. I feel I could pick up things that would have initially bypassed me on a repeat watch as the only problem is that it feels a bit patchy in the beginning with just a gangland style culture being aired for our entertainment. It's credit to the writer that several different chapters all intertwine at various stages, provoking a change in direction for our thoughts. I'll admit to still being somewhat confused as to the purpose of some of the characters but to think I'd be so keen to watch this again after the slow start I endured was definitely surprising.",

The effect was humorless, condescending and contrived - like they were working off a checklist. As a result of the vast ensemble cast, there's no opportunity for any character to develop or connect with the audience. It leaves the film soulless and the viewer unsympathetic. I felt like I was being lectured with the aid of a collection of props and hypotheticals. At no point could I accept it as real. I must make comparison to Spike Lee, who makes great films about race and oppression without the complicated pretension and with a lot more soul.",

I liked the way that is shows racism on multiple levels in a way that no-one from any racial background is spared completely and there are no strictly \"good\" and \"bad\" characters - just flawed perspectives. And it  emphasises extremely well the danger of stereotyping anyone - especially ourselves. But the best thing about the script in this movie is that it doesn't always do what you expect and successfully gives the viewer some genuine unpredictable surprises.

Well, it's still not enough to ruin this film.\n\nThis one packs an emotional punch, several in fact and it's because of how daring it is- it's uncompromising and by all means, emotionally brutal. It hammers it's point so hard that it doesn't even reflect on it really as it doesn't need to- it knows you'll be thinking about it after it's all said and done.  The thing that makes this great are the stories- several great moments all of which are memorable and poignantly beautiful. It all easily makes up for the harsh tone and shows the passion that went in to it. The vision behind it  is more than admirable- this is a script that wants to be remembered and it succeeds. \n\nIt avoids clichés too- it's harsh and gritty tone may be nasty but it somehow makes this more believable- I think that's where it succeeds over films like Traffic, which is often seen as it's superior- I prefer Crash though. I acknowledge that it has more faults but it achieves a boldness that films rarely accomplish these days.\n\nI highly recommend you watch this one as even if you don't like it- you'll still be glad you've seen it and you'll remember for it's guts as much as for whatever you  may dislike about it.",

Si bien dentro del genero de las peliculas con historias conectadas Crash es de las buenas, teniendo ellas algun sentido (piensen en Babel como conexion sin sentido), lo cierto es que ninguna de las historias es capaz de atraparte completamente. El ejemplo mas claro son las cosas que le pasan a Matt Dillon, el capitan que abusa primero de una mujer negra, para luego ayudarla circunstancialmente en un accidente. Ahora bien, cuando te muestran tus problemas en la casa con su padre y el seguro social, ¿conmueve a alguien? A mi juicio no, y es principalmente porque ningun personaje esta muy trabajado.

There are some stand-out performances, particularly Dillon, Newton, and Cheadle. Of course there were some slightly off-putting performances as well (e.g. Bullock and Fraser). The script is decent enough and does a fine job threading together the interwoven storylines. But ultimately the film fails because of its ham-handed approach and hyper moral awareness.

Even though there are deep topics at the center of the film, the characters portrayed are very identifiable, and it's interesting to see how feelings change about certain characters over the course of the film. What 'Crash' really excels at is its ability to introduce thought-provoking questions that stay with you long after watching the plot unfold onscreen. To add to things, there are no issues with pacing, and the film easily keeps your attention, which is something a lot of dramas have trouble with in this day and age.

There's no doubt that racism exists in the world today but I hardly think people in real life would be that obvious about it out in the open. Then I got to thinking, I'm sure there are people like this in the world, people who are so blinded by hate to just say it out in the open. There are also quite a lot of coincidences in this film and I don't like them in films because I think its just a lame way to get out of a scenario but in this film they not only work but they are necessary and I did like them, they served some tension sometimes as well. This movie is quite a spectacle to see, any number of things could have gone wrong but it did not and it surprisingly all comes together in a neat little package that really gets under your skin and stays there for a good while. It also has an amazing ensemble cast with Matt Dillon stealing the show. The scene in which his character saves another is one of the most memorable things I've ever seen and the scene with Michael Pena and his daughter talking about the fairy is one of the most touching scenes I've ever seen- he needs more credit then he gets. It was a hard year for the Oscars but they probably picked this because of the scope of the piece, this cannot have been an easy movie to pull off but then if you look at it that way, Ang Lee won for best directing, but again, they had their reasons. \n\nGreat movie.

The film is very dramatic and very deep it brings out emotions from the audience by experiencing the troubles that these characters go through within the film. The film's ending was also notably great as it wrapped up all the main story lines but at the same time shows the hypo criticism that some characters show regarding discrimination as whether we mean to or not it happens from us all.

As tensÃµes raciais nÃ£o afligem apenas os Estados Unidos, tÃ£o pouco se resumem Ã  dicotomia branco/negro. O Brasil Ã (C), inclusive, um paÃ­s cuja caracterÃ­stica marcante Ã (C) a mistura Ã (C)tnica.\nO senso comum diz que o preconceito no Brasil Ã (C) velado, ou seja, que ele nÃ£o Ã (C) direto e violento. Nas escolas, crianÃ§as sÃ£o educadas a dizer ânegrosâ? ou âafrodescendentesâ?, mas nunca âpretosâ?. No espaÃ§o pÃºblico, as pessoas tendem a se distanciar de um negro e preferir a companhia de um branco por lhe representar menos ameaÃ§a â\" associa-se o negro e o mulato Ã  criminalidade, ao roubo, ao assassinato, ao trÃ¡fico. A discriminaÃ§Ã£o racial, por classe social e por deficiÃªncia fÃ­sica, por exemplo, sÃ£o proibidas por lei, mas nos edifÃ­cios existem elevadores sociais e de serviÃ§os. As estruturas dentro da sociedade reforÃ§am a exclusÃ£o.\nâCrash â\" No Limiteâ? mostra a intolerÃ¢ncia racial de forma velada e descarada, mas nÃ£o condena ou vitimiza as personagens. O longa-metragem anula o maniqueÃ­smo bom/mau nas diversas situaÃ§Ãµes da trama a que sÃ£o submetidas as personagens ao realizarem aÃ§Ãµes condenÃ¡veis ao senso comum, mas os âredimeâ? em seguida ao mostrar situaÃ§Ãµes em que essas mesmas pessoas agem de forma, segundo a moral, positiva. A trama apresenta as personagens como seres humanos, por sua natureza contraditÃ³rios: o âbemâ? e o âmalâ?, sob a Ã³tica da moral das sociedades ocidentais, convivendo em um mesmo indivÃ­duo.\nTomemos como exemplo o policial, que era gentil e carinhoso com o pai, mas ao mesmo tempo era racista. Ele se envolve em uma cena de âredenÃ§Ã£oâ? mais adiante do filme, quando reencontra uma cidadÃ£ negra que havia molestado previamente e salva a vida dela. Ou ainda, a esposa do coreano atropelado que lucra com o trÃ¡fico de escravos tailandeses enquanto Ã (C) amorosa com o marido; a mulher rica que maltrata seus empregados, mas tambÃ (C)m tem sua cena de redenÃ§Ã£o mais adiante ao abraÃ§ar a empregada hispÃ¢nica e confidenciar a ela que era sua Ãºnica amiga.\nO diferente durante todo o filme Ã (C) encarado com receio ou descaso, seja a famÃ­lia de iranianos, o coreano atropelado ou a detetive de El Salvador. A cena final do filme Ã (C), nesse sentido, interessante: ela recupera a libertaÃ§Ã£o dos escravos negros ao construir uma situaÃ§Ã£o em que um ladrÃ£o de automÃ³veis negro liberta escravos tailandeses em Chinatown, um bairro chinÃªs de Los Angeles, e entrega uma pequena quantia de dinheiro para que eles sobrevivam sozinhos. Dadas as condiÃ§Ãµes, Ã (C) provÃ¡vel que a situaÃ§Ã£o negra se repita para esses tailandeses: alheios Ã quela realidade, esses ex-escravos nÃ£o terÃ£o condiÃ§Ãµes de se inserir na sociedade, sem trabalho, sem moradia, sem conhecimento da cultura local. SÃ£o pessoas que serÃ£o excluÃ­das do sistema, que viverÃ£o na marginalidade.\nA trama gira em torno de vÃ¡rios personagens paralelamente, que se relacionam de alguma forma em um espaÃ§o de 36 horas na cidade de Los Angeles. As histÃ³rias se entrelaÃ§am, aludindo Ã  teoria dos Seis Graus de SeparaÃ§Ã£o â\" em atÃ (C) seis conexÃµes, uma pessoa pode se ligar a qualquer outra no mundo.\nLeia a review em: http://cibridismo.wordpress.com/2010/08/15/crash-no-limite-2004-uma-analise-critica/",

But now I have and here's my review for Crash.\r\n\r\nPlot: The film is set with all these stories that kind of mash together. They're mostly about a Persian shop owner who can't read English but his daughter does, a detective who is looking for his missing brother, two African Americans who carjack a district attorney and his wife, a hispanic locksmith who is trying to make his 6 year old daughter feel safe, a police man who molests an african american's wife while he and his partner pulls them over, and his partner who wants to transfer from him because of it. During the events of the film all these people are facing all these problems; mostly problems with racism.\r\n\r\nOkay that's not too much of an explained plot, but I think that's the best way to explain what the movie is generally about with all of these characters to focus on. Anyway, this was a very nice movie. It was beautifully acted, some of the stories were really emotional, it did give a good message that - while it could've over done it somewhat as some critics have felt - I think was something that we should still keep in mind even today. But what really makes this a good movie was some of the scenes during the second half of this film. I won't tell what happens of coarse but these scene are just...so darn powerful. You will get scared, you might cry, you might manage to to be happy at the end of one particular scene, they're just...just...wow. \r\n\r\nActors/Characters:\r\nSandra Bullock/Jean: Okay so I guess I was wrong in the sense that she didn't entirely turn out to be a spectacular actress until The Blind Side. Sandra Bullock wasn't in this movie a whole lot but she did a great job as Jean whenever she was.\r\nMichael Pena/Daniel: I think he gave out the best performance in the entire movie. I mean what happened to his character a little close to the very end was powerful and how the performed it was just perfect. Nuff said really.\r\n\r\nAnd that's my review for Crash. It's a powerful movie with brilliant acting and some of the most powerful and emotional scenes you'll probably have ever seen in your whole life.",

            "content": "Crash, directed and written by Paul Haggis, is one of those films whose reputation (or disrepute) is far bigger than the film itself. If the film had never won the Best Picture Oscar in 2006 (over Brokeback Mountain, which everyone considered a 100% certain winner), it would have been quickly forgotten. But ever since the visibly surprised Jack Nicholson announced it as the winner, many people have denounced it as the worst film of the decade and the worst film to ever win the award. Even in 2010s they still keep reminding us what a self-indulgent, pseudo-profound and sentimental piece of crap it was.\n \nCrash has numerous storylines and characters, all surrounding the subject of racism. During 36 hours, various people in Los Angeles, including a black cop, an Iranian shopkeeper, a Hispanic locksmith, two black carjackers and a wealthy district attorney and his ever-querulous wife among others, get in touch with multiculturalism, xenophobia and their own prejudices.\n \nI do acknowledge the flaws of Crash, which are many. One thing it was particularly criticized for was being preachy. It isn't that all the time, but it has moments when you feel like the message is shoved down your throat. Some of the dialogue is very heavy-handed and exaggerated and some plot points forced. And sometimes it slips to sentimentality and even feels like a soap opera.\n\nBut Crash is not a bad film. In fact, it's pretty damn good. Why? Because no matter how many faults you find from it, no matter how self-important, soapy and sentimental it may be, it does provoke thoughts and feelings. It drills deep down to the nature of prejudices, and bravely tackles on the prevalence and everyday nature of racism. It may not be a politically correct film. It deals with questions of racism directly and straight out, forcing the viewers also to ponder their own attitude towards different people.\n\nAnd what Haggis really succeeds at is creating character portraits. He refuses to make any of them a stereotype or a caricature. You learn to care about the characters and their fates, no matter how unpleasant some of them may seem at first. For example, Matt Dillon's character, a policeman John Ryan, is at first shown as a racist prick, as he sexually harasses Thandie Newton's character and forces her husband to watch, but later we see him feeling anguish over his sick father, and we understand why he did such an obscene thing. The two carjackers are at first shown as one-dimensional, stereotypical hoppers, but the other one of them is apparently religious, and the other one has a surprise for us at the very end of the film. There isn't a clear protagonist in the film, and some of the characters get less screen time than others, but we can still clearly understand who they are and what their lives are like.\n\nThe film is quite cynical in demonstrating peoples' attitude towards strangers, indicating that they're always suspecting the worst about each other. But it also believes in an individual's ability to change. Many critics have asserted that the film uses an overly complex story and large character gallery to deliver a simplistic message (\"racism is bad\"), but there is much more below the surface; the film paints a very complex picture about human nature.\n\nSome of the characters and situations where they learn something feel awkward; like the Iranian shopkeeper, who is mostly shown as an incredulous, hysterical, impolite freak, who learns to be more confiding and peaceful only after accidentally shooting a little girl. And it's very hard to believe that Ryan and his partner, would end up meeting the couple that Ryan embarrassed the next day in their respective situations. But these unconvincing scenes have such dramatic tension that you don't pay attention to their improbability.\n\nThe film is also well shot by J. Michael Muro, but the true star here is the editor Hughes Winborne, who carries the story (or stories) on so fluently that you aren't confused at any point. The transitions from one story to another are completely seamless, and we always get to spend the right amount of time with one character before going on to the next. Mark Isham's score is also impressive; sometimes it's frustratingly underlining but mostly very beautiful.\n\nThe performances of Crash range from terrific to plain silly. The best performances come from Matt Dillon (who also received an Oscar nomination), who is truly spooky as Ryan, who has problems to control his own prejudices, and Don Cheadle, who is very convincing as a cop looking for his criminal brother. Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton are also really good as the black couple. Keith David has only a brief role, but delivers a nice, smooth performance as a police lieutenant. Chris Bridges, better known as the rapper Ludacris, is also pretty good, while you could expect him to be absolutely terrible, as musicians who become actors often are.\n\nHowever, there are some weaker performances as well. Sandra Bullock is still not convincing, even though she's clearly trying to find a new dimension from herself as an actor. Ryan Phillippe is too inexpressive in his role as Ryan's partner, and Brendan Fraser is totally wooden. But Bullock's and Fraser's characters are some of the most irrelevant of the film, so it's obvious they can't get much out of them. They are also the characters you care about the least.\n\nOverall Crash is a film that deserves to be seen and thought about. Sure it has flaws and isn't a masterpiece that will stick in your mind forever, but it's a solid, well written, well directed and mostly well acted drama. Did it deserve to win the Best Picture Oscar or not? Who knows, moreover, who cares? The awards are a side issue. Haggis has made the film with good intentions, hoping to make people think and discuss the subject matter, and even if you find the end result clumsy, it's always better to have a story with at least some thought in it than a story left untold, right? I like Crash. I think it's a good film. And I'm not ashamed to admit it.",

Those intimate details and the \"seemingly\" random, sometimes violent interactions of the main players, oddly draw the audience in closer, created a sense of connectedness and community where one doesn't appear to exist.   \n\nCrash is a cautiously optimistic film and an uplifting film without the traditional high fructose Hollywood corn syrup.  Yes, there are a few implausible moments, but they aren't Indiana Jones Nuke The Fridge moments, they are purposeful and meaningful.\n\nCatch it if you haven't, it might change your karma, pun intended.",

The acting is pretty solid overall but then there's the rest.\n\nI don't know if it's because I don't have enough insight in the american everyday life but I never clocked into it. The beginning part of the movie, when different examples of racism is thrown in my face as if that's the whole picture is nothing I buy. \n\nBut then again - I'm from Sweden and to me the SEXIST cop versus the woman (NOT black woman...) seemed far more interesting.\n\nAnd the movie is in way over it's head which is brilliantly shown when the Ludacris character steals a van full of illegal Asian immigrants...what?! The two black criminals (Ludacris' + someone) seems fit more in a not-so-funny comedy...\n\nThe absolute ending is really something I don't like. Is the Ludacris character a good guy for not selling the Asian immigrants but just releasing them on the street?\n\nSome stories, and this one is packed with them, doesn't get a proper ending. Some things are in your face and some is so wage that I waited for an explanation or some clue that never came along. \n\nBut the one thing that this movie does wrong is that the connections aren't strong enough to tie the film together and since there are so many of them I can't feel strongly for one pretty much any one of them. Which is sad. This is especially true for the police murder investigation story that when it flashes by I've forgotten most and the ending to it seemed kinda fine so that's sad to.\n\nOne good idea is one of the stories that doesn't get closure and is introduced way to late. The other cop shooting a guy...\n\nDisappointing. Go watch any of the Alejandro González Iñárritu movies and see what one of these type movies really should be like.",

Brokeback Mountain (***) had won numerous awards that year, including the Best Director Oscar for Ang Lee but I think Crash (****)- which was little known at the time - rightfully won the big prize.\n\nBrokeback Mountain was very scenic and featured a very appropriate soundtrack, transporting viewers back to Wyoming in the 1960s. The film carried the positive message that love isnâ(TM)t limited by gender or race but a far deeper emotion. But although the film was enjoyable, it had only one major theme and I think there is a lack of depth to the picture. Crash is far more multi-dimensional. The fact that it was seen by far few people doesnâ(TM)t limit the style and substance that it shoes.\n\nCrash talks about racial prejudice and the relationships between members of different ethnic groups. The stories of various African-Americans, W.A.S.P.s, Red-Necks, Persians, Cambodians, and Hispanics become intertwined during a forty-eight hour period and every interaction - even between family members - is coloured by racism. Nobody is totally good or bad and hardly anybody gets what they deserve; human relations are a lot like the many car accidents which occur on the streets of Los Angeles.\n\nFirst impressions are inevitably wrong (and itâ(TM)s not always the situation where they guy who seems to be bad turns out to be good but seemingly innocent victims are revealed to be slightly more malevolent than they first appear). In a scene between Graham Waters, a detective played by Don Cheadle, and Flanagan, a member of the District Attorneyâ(TM)s office, it is understood that they may get a situation wrong but they need to start criminal proceedings because the court of public opinion is already underway.\n\nThe screenplay is tragic at times, uplifting at others; there are insightful moments and humourous ones. By showing all the sides of a situation, the film shows how everyoneâ(TM)s perspective differs. At the end of the film, despite everything that happened - and continues to happen everyday - business continues as usual and humans continue to interact with each other.

I have to say i was prepared for a terrible movie because most of the people who have been telling me to watch it wear rocca wear, have large hoop earrings or frequently sport sweatpants with words of phrases on the butt (not knocking any of those fashionable styles just saying thats it's not my cup of tea neither are the movies that those particular individuals watch). So anyway after months and months of being hounded by everyone to watch it, i decided to put it in (my dad rented it and i found it in the den, i would never pay for a movie with ludacris in it) Anyway i popped it in before work the other day and watched it. I couldn't help but feel as if i was watching traffic, or 21 grams again. not that it had any similar plot similarities just by the way the story was told. well i finished the movie and just wished i never watched it. Yea, over lapping story lines are pretty cool and i get the whole story but i don't really care about it. i though the movie would have been much better if sandra bulloch died after falling down the stairs and the little hispanic girl got owned by the persian guy just because i was way done with watching this movie at the time and just wanted to get in the shower and get ready for work. I thought that the casting could have been a little better \"the Chead\" was excellent as the detective and i would have left him in as the lead character. even ludacris was actually really good and it is really hard to say it but he was. my second favorite character actually next to \"the chead\" (Don Cheadle if you're slow) Oh and i like the lock smith a lot and totally called the invisible cape deal because i love calling it. Bottom line is that \"Crash\" wasn't for me, it was ok but simply not for me. Sandra Bulloch and Brendan Frasier sucked btw. all and all i give it 61 out of 100 points despite all its award nominations. I just didn't like it. My newest must watch movie is now \"History of Violence\" Pass crash at the video store and movei towards the H section. this movie was absolutely flawless. check it out. I will write a review soon.\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nBut yea really not into the whole tons of stuff going on at once, everyone is connected, type story line.\nThese are all just traffic, babel, magnolia, 21 grams and any other movie like that just again. I was bored with whoever did it first. Next time at least maybe throw some Kevin Bacon on it.",

            "content": "I was looking forward to my long-delayed viewing of Paul Haggis' Crash. I thought it would provide me with an experience along the lines of when I watched Falling Down, a breathtaking portrayal of societal arrogance, where I was riveted and infuriated for much of the film. Instead, Crash is a by-the-numbers film about America being a melting pot of racists, waiting to be set off in a cliche set up, and appears to be more of a stock lecture instead of a truly eye-opening film.\n\nI must give respect and well-earned shock to the film for winning Best Picture, over critic/fan favorite, Brokeback Mountain. Its win was probably one of the biggest stuns next to when Annie Hall bested Star Wars in 1977, or when Forrest Gump stomped both Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption for the same title in 1994. Crash is definitely an interesting piece, setting its sights on the controversial nature of racism and its victims and alarmists, but manages to plod along in its runtime, rarely reaching heights of admirable status, and manages to be questionably exploitative and, dare I say, racist in itself.\n\nThe film follows numerous characters in a forty-eight hour period in Los Angeles where they are met with racial confrontations, have their personal outlooks and insights tested, and eventually, have their stories intertwined with one another in some way, shape or form, connected by the central focus; a car crash. Such characters are a black LAPD officer (Don Cheadle) who is long estranged from his mother, a white District Attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his spoiled-rotten wife (Sandra Bullock) whose car was hijacked by two young black men (Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges and Larenz Tate), a racist white police officer (Matt Dillon), who molests a black woman (Thandie Newton) right in front of her husband (Terrence Howard), a Hispanic locksmith (Michael Pena) trying to keep his family business straight, an uptight Persian immigrant (Shaun Toub), and an optimistic cop (Ryan Phillippe), who works with Matt Dillon's character.\n\nRight off the bat, there are far too many underdeveloped characters here. The way we are greeted with them is awkward, too fast, and lacks much substance. In an ordinary anthology film with intertwining characters, take Adam Rifkin's criminally underrated and near-perfect film, LOOK for example, we spend enough time to get to know the characters, form opinions about them, and actually become intrigued and somewhat astonished at how they meet and engage with one another. Crash breathlessly tries to juggle a dozen loose stories and find creative ways for them to connect with each other that it doesn't have time to adapt its subjects into believable people. It's almost encouraging its own problem by stereotyping its characters.\n\nThe film portrays all of its characters as on-the-edge racists triggered by a fairly mild, forgivable, and misunderstood circumstance where every conclusion is jumped to and nobody is smart enough to think something over before acting. Perhaps Crash is trying to show us that that, specifically, is the problem, but it is gone about in such a ham-fisted, heavy-handed way that we know what the film is trying to say, but we simply don't care and are tired of being talked down to for close to two hours.\n\nWith that being said, it must too be stated that all the actors here do a wonderful job at, at least, trying to create versatile, believable characters, although few succeed. Sandra Bullock is the standout here, simply giving it her all and showing us true character-acting versatility in not only her role-choices, but her creative and involved performances. Ludacris isn't as outgunned as I thought he'd be, Don Cheadle does exceptional work, Matt Dillon is great here, and so is the rest of the cast. But inevitably, I'm reminded of the one-dimensional characters they play and the truly vacuous background that plagues each and every one of them. A quick look at other reviewers scattered across the internet show that their shallowness has neglected people to notice the good acting behind them.\n\nThe film concludes with one of the lamest, most uncreative Hollywood endings in a blue moon, showing us easily the most schmaltzy, conventional, unbelievable, cringe-inducing ending a film about racism could possible give us. Even with dedicated performances from a barrage of different talents, Crash connects their characters' stories in such a contrived and facile way it's distracting, is plagued by levels of sheer incredulity, and occupies an end scene of complete and total folderol. As a whole, it plays like a heavy-handed lecture by a representative of the \"Why Can't We All Just Get Along?\" committee.\n\nStarring: Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, Larenz Tate, Shaun Toub, and Michael Peña. Directed by: Paul Haggis.",

Some argue that everything that occurs in this movie is too much of a coincidence, but you know what? The level of emotion that Crash reaches is so staggering to the point where you shouldn't even be caring about those minor setbacks, and if you do, you need to let off some steam.
