The film, which was directed by Hayao Miyazaki and was made by Studio Ghibli, is about Sophie, a young girl who is cursed by a witch and becomes an elderly woman. Sophie, who is determined to overcome the curse, finds sanctuary in the wizard Howl's mobile castle, where she meets a variety of magical beings and sets off on a quest for understanding herself.\n\nWith each frame painstakingly designed to create a rich and detailed universe that is both visually appealing and immersive, the animation in \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is astounding. The characters are also masterfully created, and each one has a distinct personality that gives the narrative depth and complexity. \n\nAlso, the voice acting is outstanding, with Billy Crystal, Christian Bale, Jean Simmons, and Emily Mortimer giving memorable performances that bring their characters to life. \n\nEven if the movie's premise occasionally seems confusing, it is ultimately a touching story about the strength of love, acceptance, and self-belief. The film also addresses issues of greed, violence, and the value of environmental preservation, making it a challenging and socially important work of art.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is a must-see movie for anyone who enjoys beautiful animation, lovable characters, and an interesting and inventive plot. It is a genuine animation cinematic masterpiece that will charm and enthrall viewers of all ages.",

            "content": "Howl's moving castle was my favorite movie so far.it is a well-known Japanese classic 2D animation by Studio Ghibli. It is one of the great movies directed by Hayao Miyazaki, adapted from Diana Wynne Jones's novel. It has all his classic Miyazaki style with amazing animation, rich world-building, a great storyline, and character development. \nAn animated fantasy film about a fictional kingdom where there are witches and wizards exist and there was a war between two kingdoms. The story was about Sophie, a young hat maker and the eldest daughter of the family who has taken care of her father's store. She was cursed by a witch who visited her shops, turning her into an elderly woman. She later met Howl and ended up staying with him, getting caught ups in his fighting.\nHaving experienced the film. I have to admit that the animation was amazing as always. A detailed 2D animation and bright color backgrounds are gorgeous. The visual style is also unique and has an interesting concept. It was creating a magical and stunning atmosphere though out the story. We can see how the characters feel and how smooth the animation like the hair and effects in the story, especially magic, and food. It was so detailed and looked really delicious, as expected of Ghibli studio.\nThe story overall was fun, even though, it is a story adapted from a novel but it did not disappoint me at all. This film is so imaginative and delightful. It was well written. However, people who have never read an original novel before might be confused with the film's plot. It took me to watch it two to three times until I could understand the plot and concept of the story. It is pretty hard to notice Sophie's power like how she switches between being behind an elder and a teenage girl. The identity of the scarecrow has few scenes and was not mentioned much in the story, including the story about the cause that create the war between the two kingdoms.\nThe topics that were mentioned the most in the story are probably the characters. The characters are wonderful. It was so well written that each one has his or her own personality and their own character development. Sophie is a shy young girl, working as a milliner in her family's hat shop. She has the ability to make what she says come true without knowing it. The fact that her appearance changes according to her confidence. That is why sometimes we can see her returning to being a young woman during the story. We would see How she becomes younger as she has more self-esteem during the story and how she helps Howl with her power. This was not very well described in the film so many people might be confused.\nNext, wizard Howl with a nice character design. A handsome wizard who caught and made a contract with a falling star named Calcifer. He is my favorite character. According to the original novel, he has a flamboyant, dramatic, and cowardly personality. He was also kind and generous that he allowed Sophie to live with him and help her. We can see how he change during the story, being more honest with himself and opening up to other.",

The characters weren't anything I was interested in and they all blended together for me and didn't stand out. This Miyazaki film, this is going to have plenty of incredible filmmaking aspects. The animation is obviously very good and the soundtrack is amazing as well. Also, there are a lot of themes that are executed very well.

Sure, it has great visuals, the art is amazing, and the character developments are good.\nBut Howl... ohh no. How is he so overrated?! I don't like him at all. He's not even hot! Sure, he has some nice looks, but beauty comes from the inside and he has nothing of that. I like his bird form tho, but other than that... nope. \nI gave him a chance, but after his quote: \"I see no point in living if I can't be beautiful.\" Nope. So pathetic. So, so, so pathetic. -_-\nAnd Sophie... I thought she knew better. But as soon as Howl rescued her from these guards, she fell over him. I liked her, especially as her old self, but her choosing him... ah, nope. She'd be better off with that scarecrow/prince for sure. He at least truly loves her and is cute too!\nMy favorite character would be Calcifer though. Cute! And adorable. And funny at the same time! His jokes are the best and his relationship with Sophie, oh my xD\nAnd, even though the Witch of Waste annoyed me several times, I think I still kinda like her. When she lost her magic, she was hilarious. Though when she grabbed Howl's heart, that was a bit pathetic again, but I still like her... I don't even know why, but at least she has character, instead of Howl.\nOh, yeah, and Markl was the best too! I just wonder where he comes from and how he ended up in the Castle. We barely know anything from him, except that he's practicing to be a wizard, but other than that... I need his background story! \n\nHowl x Sophie is probably one of the worst love stories I've ever seen. They sure wanted to have that beauty and the beast vibe, and it was kinda like that, except that the beast was pathetic here.\nOverall the movie was great, except I really don't like Howl.",

Despite this, I still think this is just an okay movie, and the weakest Studio Ghibli film I have seen so far. However, this isn't saying much since I still have a lot more movies from them I have yet to see. The story is very slow-paced and isn't always that interesting, despite some very fascinating visuals.

This song is remade a bit differently in the film in different scense, to understand that this song has many emotions sewed into it. A lot of the scenes have these bits of music that can make us feel the suspense and the fear lurking around the corner. Another good song used in this film was one called Salimans Spell, you can feel the villain character come to life and like i said, the danger they have to offer.",

It creates a rush of emotions that engages you and adds a magical feel to the film. The one song that stood out, in particular, was \"Merry-Go-Round of Life\" by Joe Hisaishi, which is played multiple times throughout the film, with some scenes having a soft, quieter version of the song, and others having a loud, dramatic version. The song is so powerful, evoking sadness and joy at the same time.  The movie would not be the same without it.\n\n\tI would definitely recommend this movie. Although anime is not my favorite genre of film, this movie was one of the best I've seen. The soundtrack was incredible, along with an engaging plot that included so many different themes like adventure, action, romance, comedy, fantasy, and drama. I love how beautifully the film was animated, and it was incredibly detailed. The whole aspect of the moving castle was so interesting, and the amount of detail in the house was mind-blowing. I would give it 4 out of 5 stars, because although it was great, there were a few scenes that left me wondering, along with the ending not being my favorite. Nevertheless, I will still be recommending this movie to many people.",

I admit I haven't read the book by Diana Wynne Jones, but this film is so imaginative and delightful I doubt I would have cared if it was unfaithful to the book or not. The animation here is amazing, the backgrounds are gorgeous and the colours so bright. Plus the castle itself was a wonder to behold. The visual style here also has a certain elegance about it, and the atmosphere the visuals create is somewhat meticulous. I also have to mention the score, it was absolutely stunning. Beautiful, magical and poignant themes that caressed my ears, like a Mozart opera would. The characters are engaging and are beautifully voiced by a terrific voice cast. Christian Bale's(not a stranger to voice work, he voiced Thomas in Disney's Pocahontas as well) seductive and silky voice brings vain wizard Howl to vivid life, and Sophie is a very lovable and beautiful character, whether in her younger form or her older form. Her younger form is sensitively voiced by Emily Mortimer and her older self is voiced by the late Jean Simmons with real sincerity. The Witch of the Waste is a character consumed by jealousy, so much so it results in Sophie's transformation from a young 18 year old girl to a pensioner. This character is perfectly voiced by screen legend Lauren Bacall. Billy Crystal is a joy to behold as Calcifer, one of my favourite characters in the film, and Turniphead was very intriguing as well. The story is a sweet, timeless imaginative one, not the best written one by all means, but it did touch me a lot. Did I notice anything wrong? Yes, but these flaws are minor compared to the overall beauty of the film. The final third is a little too rushed, and the ending is a little over-surreal. But overall, Howl's Moving Castle is an enchanting and delightful work from Miyazaki. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Maybe something was lost in translation but the plot was just terrible. I could go on and on about the awful plot but I'll just pick a couple things that really stuck out. First off, the ending is outrageously stupid. Basically this witch takes Howl's heart and won't give it back and all the characters crash and nearly die while everyone pleads with her to give it back. Then like 10 minutes later Sophie returns to the witch and says she would like the heart back and the witch (now with nothing to lose because they've all crashed anyways and didn't die) gives it back because Sophie \"really wants it\".. WHAT?! Then Sophie kisses a scarecrow, GROSS? But that somehow turns the scarecrow into a person, and then the guy claims he's the missing prince from the next town over, which hasn't been a prominent story line throughout the film at all. Also Howl seems to fall in love with a 90 year old woman who occasionally changes back to a 20 year old, with no indication of what changes her back and forth and no indication that she'll stay 20 in the future, so essentially he's throwing away his future for a woman who could very well be 90 moving forward. Do not waste your time watching this movie, it was truly awful.",

The motely crew that works together in this story each have their role to play. They learn the importance of compassion from the presence of the main character, Sophie who is depicted very well between her different ages. The film has an obvious anti-war message that is present throughout the film. From the dehumanization of participants of war to destruction of the beauty in the world, that message is reflected in many ways. Sophie's compassion for others works well with this message to show the power of love over hate and the good it can bring to the world. Her character is celebrated for her compassion while also shown to be a fun-loving woman that is very motherly by nature. The only cracks in the film can be seen with the character Howl and not having a complete understanding of who he really is. He is shown to be a very magical being with great importance to the world he is in, yet I can't get a full understanding of who he is even after they try to tack on some backstory near the end of the film. There is a lot of interesting visuals, and the moving castle is obviously the biggest piece of that. I love how they made the castle feel like its own character even with another character being the one giving it life. It is a lively movie with a good message that is good for most to take in.",

            "content": "Amazingly magical story, beautiful animation, compelling characters with compelling relationships. Truly a world I want to live in. SLIGHT SPOILERS, but I absolutely have to touch on the depiction of Sophie's kindness and compassion as not only one of her best, most valuable traits, but also as traits she actively employs, and that benefit her and others. Kindness and compassion are traits that in your classical, and disney, fairy tale, are often attributed to female leads, and seen as their most worthy (though maybe only real) traits. Let's take Disney's Cinderella as an example, while treated awfully by her step mother and step siblings, she never loses her ability to be kind or takes out her frustration on other people or creatures, even her awful step-family. While I believe that this is an incredibly virtuosos trait and something to be admired, Cinderella holds very little agency in her own story. Sophie has similar traits of kindness and compassion, but the way she chooses to act on those traits actively shapes the story. For example, her kindness to turnip head earns her a helpful ally and in the end helps turnip head in an even more powerful way. And obviously her love for Howl has a powerful and direct effect. You can see the way her kind actions spiral outward and positively effect the lives of those around her. I just think it's a beautiful take on a character who posses very traditionally feminine qualities, while still having agency and those qualities being a part of that. Having love in your heart will save you from the crushing burden of having to feel in this world and blah blah blah I love this movie.\n\nAnyways, people I'd fuck in this movie:\nHowl: Who wouldn't lmao! Fun and dramatic, he'd make me feel sexy. Also I bet he's into pegging :)\nSophie's Mother: After the honey moon phase ends with her new, wealthy husband, she might find herself alone most of the time and unfulfilled. And there I'll be, young, sweet and easily enamored, ready to be her illicit little pool boy love affair or whatever rich housewives do.",

Howl and Sophie are the perfect pair where they know each other's strengths and weakness and work together off of those. Not only does this movie have fantastic characters but it also has an amazing score.

I admit I haven't read the book by Diana Wynne Jones, but this film is so imaginative and delightful I doubt I would have cared if it was unfaithful to the book or not. The animation here is amazing, the backgrounds are gorgeous and the colours so bright. Plus the castle itself was a wonder to behold. The visual style here also has a certain elegance about it, and the atmosphere the visuals create is somewhat meticulous. I also have to mention the score, it was absolutely stunning. Beautiful, magical and poignant themes that caressed my ears, like a Mozart opera would. The characters are engaging and are beautifully voiced by a terrific voice cast. Christian Bale's(not a stranger to voice work, he voiced Thomas in Disney's Pocahontas as well) seductive and silky voice brings vain wizard Howl to vivid life, and Sophie is a very lovable and beautiful character, whether in her younger form or her older form. Her younger form is sensitively voiced by Emily Mortimer and her older self is voiced by the late Jean Simmons with real sincerity. The Witch of the Waste is a character consumed by jealousy, so much so it results in Sophie's transformation from a young 18 year old girl to a pensioner. This character is perfectly voiced by screen legend Lauren Bacall. Billy Crystal is a joy to behold as Calcifer, one of my favourite characters in the film, and Turniphead was very intriguing as well. The story is a sweet, timeless imaginative one, not the best written one by all means, but it did touch me a lot. Did I notice anything wrong? Yes, but these flaws are minor compared to the overall beauty of the film. The final third is a little too rushed, and the ending is a little over-surreal. But overall, Howl's Moving Castle is an enchanting and delightful work from Miyazaki. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "The animated film, Howl's Moving Castle, is the best Hayao Miyazaki film to begin your Studio Ghibli binge. Am I biased because it was my first Miyazaki film? Yes, but with good reasons. The film is able to tackle serious topics like the effects of war on civilian life and the journey to self-love and acceptance while still being enjoyable for all ages.\n\nHayao Miyazaki portrays war as pointless and harmful in Howl's Moving Castle through the film's coloring and dialogue.  A prime example regarding color is observing how our main character, Sophie's, hometown is shown to be surrounded by lush green valleys, a clear blue sky, and bright colors from the townspeople's dresses and suits.  However, as the battling airships and bombs reach the town, the once serene landscape is congested with dark grays and black due to the smoke from the fires that have destroyed all of the empty shops and homes.  The stark contrast between the two scenes highlights how war disturbs not only the peace of the land but the lives of innocent people who are supposed to be protected by their leaders.  Regarding dialogue, \"Let's put an end to this foolish war,\" is the last we hear from the main antagonist, Madame Suliman, who was the one to first instigate the war.  Foolish war. Just those two words coming from Madam Suliman, one who's in a high royal position, call attention to Miyazaki's stance on how real-world leaders are aware of the dangers they put their citizens through when going to war, but simply do not care.  Overall, the transition from light to dark tones, and the chilling dialogue allow us to see the destruction a meaningless fight can bring to innocent people.\n\nAdditionally, Howl's Moving Castle depicts the journey to self-love and acceptance so beautifully through the appearance of Sophie throughout the film.  When Sophie is first introduced, she is perceived as simple and plain, evident through her solid, dark blue dress and plain sun hat.  Compared to the other women in town, Sophie goes on to describe herself as not beautiful like her sister or mother.  However, once Sophie is hexed by the selfish Witch of the Waste and appears as an old woman, she begins her journey to self-love.  As Sophie spends more time with Howl, every time she is confident and authentic without self-doubt, such as when she admits her love for Howl, Sophie transforms back into her youthful self.  Sophie's changing appearance symbolizes how while the journey to self-love may bring obstacles, the outcome brings out one's best self.  Watching Sophie grow into herself until she is wearing a yellow dress that signifies happiness and youth is always magical and touching every time I watch.\n\nOverall, I can not recommend this film enough to anyone at any age.  Howl's Moving Castle is suspenseful, romantic, adventurous, humorous, and heartwarming through and through.",

Suddenly, it becomes my favorite movie of all time.\nThis movie is a fantasy Japanese movie directed by Hayao Miyazaki, a famous writer and director. It was filmed based on the book that also named Howl's moving castle by a British writer, Diana Wynne Jones. Then, finally released as a film on September 5, 2004. The story talks about a girl named Sophie who was cursed by the witch and met Howl, a wizard. The movie perfectly narrated their adventures that it could make you feel like you are really in part of the situation. The animation in the movie was incredibly good, especially the scenario of the grassland and cities that look like paintings. Moreover, it is interesting to notice the different background stories of each character in the movie. Furthermore, it was impressive to watch the adventures of them and ended up with a happy ending scene. I personally like the background music named \"Merry go round of life\", it was a beautiful music that calmed my mind every time I listened to it.\n\nIt's a good movie to watch with your family on weekends together. And I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends.\n\nIf you like the movie that talks about magic, fantasy and love. This movie is definitely for you!",

Now she accompanied Howl and his moving castle and they went through a journey to help each other during the midst of a war. \n\nWhat I liked about the movie was the stunning visuals. The color and dynamic objects burst life into the movie. However, among the spectacle lied the changes in the two main characters who matured and changed their outlooks on life. \n\nThe main female character, Sophie, got turned into an old woman, and this sudden leap transformed her character to becoming more confident. This reflects the theme of old age. Miyazaki showed that being old is not bad. Instead, it makes a person more mature, confident, and compassionate. \n\nThe main male character, Howl, also matured as he remembered his identity and understood responsibility. \n\nAn obvious theme is the anti-war sentiment. The visual, with its glorious spectacle, also showed the ugly side of war where bombs destroyed houses and people. This is a strong over-arching theme. \n\nMy main problem with the movie was its fairly fast pace. As the beautiful visuals assaulted my eyes, there were a lot of things going on, and I got a bit confused on couple of scenes. \n\nOverall, a beautiful fantasy with complex characters. 8/10",

The story of Howl's moving castle is mysterious and incredible. It is an illustration of the magical world that provides various stunning scenery. The production of this anime is perfect, the motion is smooth and clean. The anime covers color theory which could bring us to the wonderful world of Howl's moving castle. However, Howl's moving castle is not a realistic story. The story also presents the gap of the society which becomes a great war in animation and especially teaches me about self-worth. The one main character of Howl's moving castle, Sofia has a problem with being a confident person. There are various causes in her life. This point of a story became my inspiration for doing something. If you are going to watch Howl's moving castle, I hope this could be your inspiration either. One more thing which made Howl's moving castle the best animation is the soundtrack which has beautiful music notes such as \u2018Merry Go Round of Life', the perfect match included in the anime made the perfection and complete the magical world on the screen with the aesthetic orchestra band.\n \nHowl's moving castle animation is inspired from the original novel. For who has read the book before. There are no worries because the anime adopt some parts of the novel's story. It might be because Ghibli studio adjusted the story for kid content.\n\nIf you plan to watch Howl's moving castle, I hope you enjoy this extraordinary animation.",

I will start by stating that this is not an awf movie; the visuals are dynamic and captivating, the music is soothing and raises one's soul, and it is clear that a lot of work went into this adaptation. That said, there are some very noticeable flaws which ruin the film in a few ways. Most importantly, the story is weak and lacks a good structure; i know that this is based off of a book, and while i have not read the original version, I feel it is safe to say that a few major storyline were reduced or cut, based on the films' rushed demeanor. The plot has a few odd moments to it which do not make any sense; for instance(spoilers) there is one scene where the main character travels back in time, and does essentially nothing to change the plot. The scene doesn't add anything that we already do not know, and it seems like filler to me. In some scenes, characters just appear out of nowhere, or change their personalities too quickly; heck, at the end, the evil witch who cursed the protagonist is suddenly nice and makes friends with their victm, out of nowhere! Compared to ghibli's other films, this one ua certainly flawed. However, I still would recommend it due to the pure wonder and artistic majestry behind this film.",

I have seen Howl's Moving Castle a dozen times and I only fall in love with Miyazaki's genuinely moving masterpiece more with each viewing. Howl's Moving Castle remains my personal favorite film from Studio Ghibli and the master of anime direction: Hayao Miyazaki. Please allow yourself some joy in this dark and miserable world. Watch Howl's Moving Castle for a timeless romance.\n\nMiyazaki's direction lets you believe in true love and caring relationships with his movie magic. I like seeing Miyazaki's love of flying and airships again with Howl's walking on air, flying around as a bird, attacking a floating airship, and Howl's flying castle. Howl's Moving Castle is such an enchanting story about romance and war that you want to watch this movie with a loved one. I hope you cherish this lovely film as I do. I think I can feel the wind in my hair during the finale like Sophie and Howl. Miyazaki's style is so evocative, you cannot help but get carried away on this magical adventure. Howl's Moving Castle may be my favorite movie ever, honestly.\n\nEmily Mortimer sounds adorable as the voice of Young Sophie for The English Dub of Howl's Moving Castle. Her charming British accent and ethereal sweetness provide a warmth and heart for Howl. Christian Bale is phenomenally expressive as the dour and flirtatious Wizard Howl. He captures Howl's playful flirting and easy nonchalance as well as Howl's dramatic mood swings. Mortimer and Bale have this wondrous chemistry as Sophie and Howl. I wish they did more voice acting in the future.\n\nJean Simmons is hilarious as the quirky old Granny Sophie under a curse from Lauren Bacall's outrageous Witch of the Waste. Billy Crystal always puts a smile on my face as the ever complaining fire demon Calcifer. Josh Hutcherson's youthful voice for Markl is very fun. Blythe Danner is excellent as the stern and commanding sorceress Suliman. Jena Malone puts on this hilariously bubbly voice as Lettie that I just adore. Honestly, the English voices are a real draw for Howl's Moving Castle. Each of these stars adds a delightful presence and serious gravitas.\n\nMiyazaki's script is all about matters of the heart, whether that is why we fight, choose the path of the pacifist, how we fall in love, what we admire in our loved ones, and how do we find confidence in ourselves. I appreciate Miyazaki's hatred of senseless warfare and general pacifism is still at play here. His clear worship of flying is as endearing as his wondrous vision of a world wherein magic is commonplace.\n\nDianna Wynne Jones' novel is brought to life by Hayao Miyazaki with pure euphoric charm. Jones' story about a girl who is cursed as an old maid, literally, only to fall for her savior Wizard Howl. It's nice to see Howl and Sophie flirt in strange, silly, and endearing ways. I cry while watching Howl's Moving Castle's tender romance and sorrowful encounters. I find it captivating and moving. \n\nStudio Ghibli's hand drawn animation has never moved with such realistic fluidity or expressed so deep emotional imagery in glorious colors. Ghibli's animation is astonishing with breathtaking magical transformation from Howl as a handsome man to a vicious bird, the shapeshifting henchmen blobs, and of course, Howl's moving castle walking around itself. Atsushi Okui's cinematography has all these stunning wide shots of Howl's valley or the bluest anime skies. His ultra close-up shots for Sophie and Howl really add a charming grace and emotion.\n\nYoji Takeshige and Noboru Yoshida's art direction is fascinating with Howl's dark leaps into the night to ward off flying invaders or gentle walks through the air with Howl and Sophie holding hands. Katsuya Kondo and Kitarou Kousaka's visual effects are magic themselves with bursts of light and sparkles for Calcifer's flames, shooting stars grasped in Howl's hands, and any number of magical spells that Howl casts throughout Howl's Moving Castle.\n\nTakeshi Seyama's editing is wonderful brisk with quick cuts from place to place with Howl's magical transportation door to the quiet serenity of Howl's private valley of flowers and fields for Sophie. Howl's Moving Castle is the fastest paced 120 minutes of cinema you'll ever see. I must mention that Howl's Moving Castle contains my favorite Joe Hisaishi score. His piano theme with symphonic swells of loving orchestration are the most romantic theme songs. Hisaishi's music has stayed in my mind and heart forever. I often find myself humming along to his theme for Howl's Moving Castle.\n\nIn all, Hayao Miyazaki proves he is the greatest anime director of all time after directing the marvelous romantic feature Howl's Moving Castle.",

I listened to the English dubbing and wouldn't have cast Christian Bale as Howl. Furthermore, the soundtrack was very repetitive (one tune repeated for the entire film), which was annoying after a while. I just don't get the appeal compared to Disney/Pixar or DreamWorks films.

Oh God, I love the characters of this movie.

The overall motivation of Sophie is odd. You think she would be invested in trying to break her curse, and moving forward to those ends, but she does little towards that goal. Markl plays little actual role in the conflicts, only acting as a weak foil to explain things to our protagonist. The ending feels rushed, and a little bit too clean, with the wars suddenly stopping at Suleiman's whims, after numerous cities have already been bombed and destroyed. \n\nMaybe it is taken for granted that a girl like Sophie is supposed to be obedient and serene according to society. Sophie developing her own voice and wisdom seems a subtle point.",

The animation can, for the most part, claim to be from Ghibli's A team, though there are a few shots where the CG elements can't quite replicate the authenticity of classic animation, usually in some aspect of excessively smooth motion. The film can be a but too overt for its own good at times, and the plot can get somewhat dense in the later stages, but the characters, the setting, the aesthetic, and the wonder are objectively grand. Calcifer and Turnip-Head must be among the greatest supporting characters in the Ghibli canon, even if the latter's fate is somewhat contrived. I love the treatment of age here, as a necesary eventuality that can be enjoyed if understood, not something to be feared. If there is a substantial fault in the story, it's the classic Miyazaki shortcoming: despite exploring such touching themes, everything ends with a bow on top (did he just 'solve war'?). (4.5/5)",

Howl's land of witches and wizards, steam-powered societies and shadowy machinations, calls back to several preceding chapters in the Studio Ghibli catalog, while still standing firm as its own original story.\n\nThe first hour is particularly good, setting the stage with the director's usual doses of playful imagination and enchanting personality. We've got magic doorways, talking flames, witches' curses, fantastic flying machines, ticker-tape military parades and, of course, gigantic palaces propelled by mechanical chicken legs. Ghibli always profits from these long establishing shots, having mastered the art of breathing life into a world and watching it blossom, and the opening act is stuffed with so much of it that I couldn't have wiped the smile from my lips if I'd tried.\n\nIt falls into a bit of a rut after that, struggling to stretch an airy premise into something larger and more meaningful. There's depth to the story, but much of it remains unrevealed as the plot meanders and stumbles its way to a hazy finale. The animation is great, as expected, with colorful characters and alluring scenarios to spare, but Howl grows lost after that initial sheen wears off.",

Of course, it helps that everything's simply incredible to look at from an animation standpoint and it's Miyazaki's vision for this that ultimately carries everything to its beautiful fruition. So much of the runtime was filled with the following examples of internal questioning. \"Wow, I wonder what that was about?\" \"Huh, I wonder what that guy's deal is?\" \"Interesting, I wonder why that's like that in this world?\" Did all of these questions end up getting answered in the end?

The landscapes, the castle moving, the protagonist's dress and her hair. And one of my favorite scenes is breakfast. (How could a movie have made me feel hungry?).\nThe characters are very charismatic and well built. Calcifer is a very comical character with very few scenes, but he does not lose his importance in the story. What to talk about Howl? He is a very important character too and we see a little bit about his personality before becoming attached to the protagonist, and his personality after her. Rather ambitious and narcissistic to become someone who cares about others.\nThen we have our protagonist named Sofia. She is humble and sweet, but she has, between the lines, a low self-esteem that is almost invisible. He is naturally a person who would help anyone, even if they were your enemy. She is a very realistic character, in which she treats her problems with caution and with her heart.\nOnce again Studio Ghibli shows once again that it does not feel obliged to provide details about the world of its film.

Neither its fantastical story, its visual splendor, nor its understated yet funny humour hold a candle to its subtext. Howl's Moving Castle's weight lies on What's beyond its story. It's actually a meditation on age and love. Miyazaki allows you here to see the world through the eyes of an adult who longs to be young again while conveying a plethora of lessons by his visual storytelling, which is here at its finest regarding practicality, but this is not the case regarding creativity.\n\nThe film also has tons of pacing issues, most noticeably in the first hurried 15 minutes and the rushed denouement. It also never fully settles into its storytelling technique. I wouldn't have minded the self-indulgent dreamy-like narration (well, not so much), nor this of the your typical sweet fairly tale one. But the mix of both made everything feels quite messy instead of flowing like a hallucinatory dream or an intriguing fantastical adventure story.\n\nIndeed, these issues had me confused a little bit. But the unprecedented practical visual storytelling I've mentioned above undeniably compensates for that. As the film proceeds, I find myself understand almost every obscure detail without being explained. That's mostly, if not entirely, due to Miyazaki's unmatched ability to tell a story relying on visual symbolism that remarkably keeps paying off till the last second.\n\nOverall, Howl's Moving Castle is the least Hayao Miyazaki film I've enjoyed so far. But that should by no means indicate that it isn't an exceptional work that's as light-hearted and delightful as it's though-provoking and heartwarming.\n\n(7.5/10)",

The plot is complex but not at all difficult to follow. The world built is the best world built in a Ghibli movie and it may have something to do with the moments when characters are not advancing the plot and just interacting in the world. There is a very smooth transition from the early mystical aspect of the movie to the more intimate ending of the movie. The plot, while there, is not very important to the story. The characters do not usually act as if they have a goal in mind but instead are wandering in a direction that is the end of the movie. Lastly the name is fitting to the movie, I love how much of a role the castle itself plays in the film. It always seems to be interesting in every scene and frequently reveal something new about itself.",

I'll be honest. I've encountered some (cough - completely insane - cough) people who don't like this movie. I think this has to do with the straight-up absolute bizarreness of some of the characters and plot. But that's what I love about it.\n\nThe wizard Howl swoops into Sophie's life with all the bravado and flamboyancy of a true hero, setting the humdrum motion of her predictable life into chaos. As she sets off for the first time, seeking to break a witch's curse, timid Sophie comes head to head with many strange people, from demons to witches, and even a turnip-headed scarecrow. Each with powers and secrets beyond her wildest expectations.\n\nThe way each character talks can be weird and explain-y about their inner thoughts or reactions. But, on top of adding to the quirky, funny nature of the movie, there's something about this that ties in with one of the underlying themes that I love so much - the changing language (and magic) of Sophie's own voice.\n\nSophie starts out as quiet and dowdy, but as she breaks off on this adventure, her voice slowly grows louder, becoming hilariously witty, and even finding ways to manifest itself in the world around it: \"I said move!\" she demands of an unbudging plane, crashed into the mouth of Howl's castle. With one kick she suddenly sends it shooting out.\n\nHowl's Moving Castle is so strangely out of this world. Yet somehow in its full hearted awkwardness and frankness about human nature, it feels familiar and close to home. Often, like Sophie, I find that I am the last one to see my own strength. But maybe, also like Sophie, in the least expected way I might have what it takes to be the only hero truly needed in saving myself.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/howls-moving-castle, and was written by Ella Russell.

There are questions left unanswered; especially with the villains.

(minor spoiler warining) The 'royal witch' for little to no reason just suddenly leaves the protagonists alone and declares peace: despite having no character growth at all. At least the former witch had her own character arch.\n\nI will say that the best thing about this film is it's portrayal of magic; magic is done with subtly, brightness, beauty, joy or emotion, symbolism and is normally depicted slowly enough so that the audience can actually see the spell working. This is how you depict magic right.",

She starts out as a shy insecure girl, and over time she gains more confidence, especially when she's an old woman who's willing to boss around the other members of Howl's Moving Castle. Most of the characters are very likeable and engaging. Howl's character is very engaging and you could see his struggles, like how much he struggles to transition from a flying creature to a human, or how much he doesn't want to go to war so tries to avoid going. However very little detail is actually given about Howl's background, we no very little about his childhood and he always seems to be a mystery.\n\nThe plot is ambitious and well done, even if it's a bit unwieldy at times. The main plot is that Sophie wants to break the curse that makes her old, although the movie is so much more than that. This is a movie ultimately about compassion, love, and the stupidity of war (this is a very anti-war film). The film shows these very well especially through's Sophie's actions helping a former enemy, and the anti-war theme is shown clearly throughout, like seeing the refugees from war leave their home, or seeing entire cities up in flames. While Sophie and Howl get to know each other over time and become closer. However the story's main \"problem\" seems to be unclear at times, and the scenes sometimes seem almost irrelevant to one another and don't transition very well. There's one scene where Sophie is trying to help Howl do one thing, then during the final part of the movie she's focussing on something entirely different. \n\nThe animation was brilliant, one of the best I've ever seen. Every scene is full of detail, like the outdoors scenes or inside the moving castle, like even the detail in all the furniture is stunning. \n\nThe music is very good as well, especially the main theme where the piano and violin perfectly captures the atmosphere of Howl's Moving Castle.\n\nThis movie is fantastic, it has great characters and an engaging story with thought provoking themes, it is very ambitious but this makes the movie a bit unclear and confusing at times. But this movie is seriously brilliant, and definitely worth watching.",

It is a shame that more western audiences haven't seen this film. I think it would spark a lot of good things in the hearts of us Americans. Just saw it again at a Fathom Event and it reminded me why I fell in love with this animation studio and their excellent films. Even the worst of their movies beats the best of most other studios today. The subtlety that Christian Bale brings to the character of Howl, when he could have easily went over the top, was perfect. Howl is a character that is nest left mysterious and quiet. His crescendo at the end will bring tears to the audience's eye after seeing the final move that he makes. Great film to introduce audiences to this fascinating studio and their work. Please go out and find it on Blu Ray or at a local theater for a Fathom Event. It is worth the time and money to watch.

It\u0092s odd, because it seems Miyazaki flat out refuses to use exposition to help the viewer figure out these new worlds he creates. However the first half of Howl\u0092s Moving Castle took some time introducing the characters and establishing the world they lived in, and for awhile I caught up and was on board for the ride. Then there is a point where the movie goes off the rails. Strange things just keep happening with no explanation and no logic to them. At a certain point I disconnected from the story, stopped caring, and found myself waiting for it all to end. That\u0092s not a good feeling to have at any time while watching a movie. I think that Howl\u0092s Moving Castle has potential, and I see that it would be easy to connect with these characters. I just wish it didn\u0092t drop into these weird acid trips that are impossible to comprehend. I think some of it was just visions or dreams as well, but they do nothing to differentiate those things visually, so I couldn\u0092t tell what was going on.

It brings out the best of things, it brings out the worst in things.\n\nHow terrifying it must be to suddenly be turned into an old person. Absolutely beautiful animation especially on the castle. The way each part moves and has it's own particular movement and characteristics. Really innovative and creative ideas in this movie. Especially that magic door that teleports the castle to distinct locations.\n\nThat witch is one ugly ass hag. Jeez, she looks like a bag of carrots going up those stairs, a blob. That dog that Howl took the form of looks so funny. He has his own little personality. Sophie is such a sweetheart and such a kind and cute girl that your hoping the whole time that she is able to return to her younger form.\n\nBeautiful colors and gorgeous landscapes are all throughout this movie.\n\nOverall, it's a little bit scattered and kind of all over the place but it was really nice to watch. Although Miyazaki's themes and characters are in this movie, I couldn't help but feel it wasn't his work sometimes. Maybe the animation or the artwork style.

If you're a bookie looking for something that abides strictly by its script, this isn't what you're looking for-- but is still something you NEED to watch. It takes a good story, and makes it even better. We see Ghibli's absolutely stunning art and animation (hell, watch it for just the art alone), and a love story that transcends age but does not angelify the person we at first assume is \"perfect\". The characters are not perfect, which makes them perfect. Do you follow?\nAt the same time, Ghibli again has no antagonist, yet again dodging perhaps the biggest cliche of all time-- one that everyone ignores. \nI rewatched this movie like 5 times, and would do it again. There is so much detail to be gained from rewatching it, and I highly recommend any Ghibli fan to do so.\n\nThat being said, Ghibli did take a f*ck up on this one, which was probably the author's fault (I forget quite what happened in the book); and that's the time paradox. Frankly, it makes as much sense as...nothing? \nWhile bonus points from themes of war and the criticism of the world's current state makes up for the stink awful plot twist, it is still a flaw.\n\nPS - Why for fucks sake is the studio listed as \"Buena Vista\"?

So I check out this one and it is RAW.  Ridiculous CREATIVITY, and they take the TIME needed in developing the characters as something as small as letting a scene go just a little more to see the intricacies of how a character walks/moves.  That's something you don't see much anymore in movies because of this A.D.H.D generation demands random entertainment and action with no meaning and WEAK characters with WEAK to no motivation.  In this movie the characters are great and could be up to interpretation because there's so much creativity going on, BUT the creativity is not so overboard it makes no sense whatsoever.  That's where ALOT of interpretation may or may not be done, and in the end it doesn't matter because the story still holds everything together.\n\nGreat stuff, now I gotta watch the rest of the Ghibli Studio movies, you never know what something new you might discover if you keep your mind open, glad I do.   Be open to listen, make, and watch more diverse art and you'll find MASTERPIECES like this.  Don't and you'll be stuck in what is majority, STATUS QUO pop art, which is mostly garbage.

It may be my disappointment speaking, but unlike his other films, Moving castle does not have a purpose, it's story means nothing. Princess Mononoke had a sensible story which can be seen as a social allegory or a truely fantastic epic fantasy. I also felt slightly disappointed with The Wind Rises because I didn't know what kind of a film it was, but it's not the film's fault and I respect Miyazaki for that.

The story is insane, so imaginative and entertaining. It's challenging and complex, which is the main reason why I'm so thrilled with it.

My major problem with the movie is the story is pretty disjointed. I had to watch this movie a couple times just to know exactly what this movie was about because it's kind of complicated. So many ideas are in this movie, it makes the story not so easy to follow. Also I think the romance in the story is a bit underdeveloped and could have used a little bit of work, but thats me. Aside from that, HMC does have like I said before, creative characters, amazing visuals, and it does have many memorable moments and scenes. I do like this movie, does it have some problems? yeah, but it's Miyazaki and his films have it's own charm, and many people seem to love it, so I'm not going to be so critical about it",

There's something to do with Howl, or because Sophie didn't want to sell on of the hats, come on Witch it was late night, give Sophie a rest or grow up, just for a hat. Nevertheless Sophie seaks help and refugees on Howl's Castle, which can walk and is controlled by Calcifer a Fire Demon, he says he was imprisoned by Howl, so they make a deal if Sophie frees him from his curse he will heal Sophie's curse as well, in the castle we learn that the front door is a transporter which can lead to four places, two cities, the main entrance of the castle and a dark place, that later is revealed that is the battle field, Howl is always on that place changing from his human form to one of a bird and according to Calcifer if he continues doing that transformation he will no longer be a human, we also meet Markl a young boy who is an apprentice of magic but we never see what he has learned only when he disguises as a midget wizard, Sophie hires herself as a cleaning lady, but we never see more about the castle, the king suddenly summons all the wizards of the kingdom to go to war, Howl refuses ... well I am telling you all the movie so I think I should take a short cut.\nThe movie has no interesting characters, Howl is just a wizard with a mentality of a teenager and we never see him do something extraordinary, also we never see about the world of the wizards that everybody talks about, and Sophie once she knows Howl and everything about magic she seems uninterested, the visuals are excellent yes, the story may be charming, I compare it to The Beauty and the Beats, yes that's so sweet but in this film it didn't look sweet. \nHowl\u00b4s Moving Castle is charming, but is the weakest work of Miyazaki, but I don\u00b4t like it as his other works, I desired for something more.",

There's an assortment of wonderful characters here, with wizard Howl (originally Takuya Kimura and Christian Bale in the English voiced version) remaining a curious and complex figure throughout. And it's his relationship with unwilling hero Sophie (Chieko Baisho/Emily Mortimer and Jean Simmons) that's the true hook here; it's a beautiful and unconventional romance that encases the story's real strength. Light entertainment comes in way of flame Calcifer (Tatsuya Gashuin/Billy Crystal) and young apprentice Markl (Ryunosuke Kamiki/Josh Hutcherson), with the grotesque Witch of the Waste (Akihiro Miwa/Lauren Bacall) proving to be a fun antagonist. \n\nOverall, this gorgeous piece triumphs with themes of bravery, love, compassion and personal redemption, and creative homages to 'The Wizard of Oz' (1939) are a lovely touch. An engaging piece that never fails to compel, this is director Hayao Miyazaki and team at their very best. \n\nOriginal (Hepburn) title: 'Hauru no Ugoku Shiro'.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nAfter watching the heart-wrenching Grave of the Fireflies, I wanted something much lighter and with more imagination as I currently am overwhelmed with reality-based problems and I just want to take my mind off the real world, even if it\u00e2??s just for a couple of hours. Howl's Moving Castle achieved that and also as a bonus, left me entertained and ecstatic.\n\nThe plot of Howl's Moving Castle is actually quite complicated to explain as the character driven issues are not actually turned on until nearly halfway into the story. For the first 20 minutes of the film, it had me believing that the film would be about Sophie, but instead it actually is about the notorious wizard Howl, told from Sophie's perspective. Hayao Miyazaki, who wrote this screenplay for this film and based on the novel by Diana Wynne Jones, demands its audience to be more concerned with its characters rather than its journey; similar to the execution that the writer-director brought for Spirited Away. Similar to my initial experience with Spirited Away, I did not quite understand the film's purpose and what it wants to take with us once ended, but I was able to forgive all of that because I had a marvellous time with this film. In its entirety, it features romance, action, adventure, and drama; also balancing each one in such a way that one cannot claim that one is more prominent over the other.\n\nAside from the film's difficulty in addressing its point, I also did have issues with its lack of exploration in its setting. The plot seems to take place during a time of war and the film doesn't give any clear explanation on what it is. Characters throughout the film mention about the war and it annoys me that not one of them goes into detail about it. Also Howl is actively involved in it, yet he doesn't give anything away. If the film did explain, please let me alert me as it might help gain a better insight to the film's story. \n\nAnother aspect I noticed was though this film was based off a book, I cannot help but gain some sort of connection with this and Disney's Beauty and the Beast. Was Hayao Miyazaki inspired by the film during the making of this film? I cannot say, but like Ponyo, whom I had the same feeling with but on The Little Mermaid instead, it enriched my experience. It made me search for little clues that the director may be directly or indirectly giving throughout the entire film.\n\nThe film's animation is breath taking. It may not be as imaginative and as tasteful as Spirited Away but Howl's Moving Castle compensates it by delivering exhilarating sequences with a variety of backdrops. Since this film was made after Spirited Away, it is expected that its visuals would be more detailed and full of color, therefore I was truly impressed with what Studio Ghibli has offered; I could only imagine what the latest Ghibli film, The Wind Rises, would look like. I was also pleased with the film's musical score as it possesses this blockbuster quality to it, which is certainly appropriate given the events that happen, but it also displays tenderness and heart during its intimate moments.\n\nI watched the film via English dub, therefore I cannot comment on the original Japanese cast. The English speaking cast actually does a great job in channelling their characters. I was most pleased with Christian Bale, Emily Mortimer and Billy Crystal. Bale delivers a low-key style of performance that connects well with the visual look of the character. The first moment when Howl (Bale) comes on screen, I was taken aback on how suave and slick he was. Emily Mortimer plays the younger version of the film's core protagonist, Sophie, and even though she has less of a presence as compared to Jean Simmons, who plays the older side of the character, she still holds up strongly and delivers that unique sound that makes the character feel distinctive, and not just another female character by Studio Ghibli. Billy Crystal provides the film's comical relief, which is something he is brilliant at. Though his character is hilarious, it doesn't reach to the obviousness that he presents on other films like in Monsters Inc., instead he plays it quite subtle and provides the role with full of heart (pun intended). The rest of the cast were also strong but I simply wanted to stand out these three cast members as their work for this film were such an important aspect to my enjoyment with this film.\n\nHowl's Moving Castle comes so close to becoming my favourite Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli film, as it does have some issues that I felt could have been addressed more effectively, though I may feel differently towards it during the subsequent viewings. I believe if you want to get a strong start into Hayao Miyazaki's filmography then I recommend starting off with this film instead of Spirited Away, as its accessible story and breathtaking visuals would easily make one a fan of both the director and the studio itself.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nAfter watching the heart-wrenching Grave of the Fireflies, I wanted something much lighter and with more imagination as I currently am overwhelmed with reality-based problems and I just want to take my mind off the real world, even if it's just for a couple of hours. Howl's Moving Castle achieved that and also as a bonus, left me entertained and ecstatic.\n\nThe plot of Howl's Moving Castle is actually quite complicated to explain as the character driven issues are not actually turned on until nearly halfway into the story. For the first 20 minutes of the film, it had me believing that the film would be about Sophie, but instead it actually is about the notorious wizard Howl, told from Sophie's perspective. Hayao Miyazaki, who wrote this screenplay for this film and based on the novel by Diana Wynne Jones, demands its audience to be more concerned with its characters rather than its journey; similar to the execution that the writer-director brought for Spirited Away. Similar to my initial experience with Spirited Away, I did not quite understand the film's purpose and what it wants to take with us once ended, but I was able to forgive all of that because I had a marvellous time with this film. In its entirety, it features romance, action, adventure, and drama; also balancing each one in such a way that one cannot claim that one is more prominent over the other.\n\nAside from the film's difficulty in addressing its point, I also did have issues with its lack of exploration in its setting. The plot seems to take place during a time of war and the film doesn't give any clear explanation on what it is. Characters throughout the film mention about the war and it annoys me that not one of them goes into detail about it. Also Howl is actively involved in it, yet he doesn't give anything away. If the film did explain, please let me alert me as it might help gain a better insight to the film's story. \n\nAnother aspect I noticed was though this film was based off a book, I cannot help but gain some sort of connection with this and Disney's Beauty and the Beast. Was Hayao Miyazaki inspired by the film during the making of this film? I cannot say, but like Ponyo, whom I had the same feeling with but on The Little Mermaid instead, it enriched my experience. It made me search for little clues that the director may be directly or indirectly giving throughout the entire film.\n\nThe film's animation is breath taking. It may not be as imaginative and as tasteful as Spirited Away but Howl's Moving Castle compensates it by delivering exhilarating sequences with a variety of backdrops. Since this film was made after Spirited Away, it is expected that its visuals would be more detailed and full of color, therefore I was truly impressed with what Studio Ghibli has offered; I could only imagine what the latest Ghibli film, The Wind Rises, would look like. I was also pleased with the film's musical score as it possesses this blockbuster quality to it, which is certainly appropriate given the events that happen, but it also displays tenderness and heart during its intimate moments.\n\nI watched the film via English dub, therefore I cannot comment on the original Japanese cast. The English speaking cast actually does a great job in channelling their characters. I was most pleased with Christian Bale, Emily Mortimer and Billy Crystal. Bale delivers a low-key style of performance that connects well with the visual look of the character. The first moment when Howl (Bale) comes on screen, I was taken aback on how suave and slick he was. Emily Mortimer plays the younger version of the film's core protagonist, Sophie, and even though she has less of a presence as compared to Jean Simmons, who plays the older side of the character, she still holds up strongly and delivers that unique sound that makes the character feel distinctive, and not just another female character by Studio Ghibli. Billy Crystal provides the film's comical relief, which is something he is brilliant at. Though his character is hilarious, it doesn't reach to the obviousness that he presents on other films like in Monsters Inc., instead he plays it quite subtle and provides the role with full of heart (pun intended). The rest of the cast were also strong but I simply wanted to stand out these three cast members as their work for this film were such an important aspect to my enjoyment with this film.\n\nHowl's Moving Castle comes so close to becoming my favourite Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli film, as it does have some issues that I felt could have been addressed more effectively, though I may feel differently towards it during the subsequent viewings. I believe if you want to get a strong start into Hayao Miyazaki's filmography then I recommend starting off with this film instead of Spirited Away, as its accessible story and breathtaking visuals would easily make one a fan of both the director and the studio itself.",

His movies are known for fairytale like stories about an ordinary person who meets magical characters. In 'Howl's Moving castle, a young girl gets cursed and ages more than 70 years.  I enjoyed the movie, but wasn't blown away by it either. I do respect the fact that it had a interesting storyline and deals with a good amount of imagination and adventure. \n\nDuring a walk, 18 year old Sophie who works in a hat shop encounters the mysterious and handsome wizard Howl. Unknowingly, she is followed to the hat shop by the Witch of Waste, who fancies Howl and puts a curse on Sophie. The young woman transforms into a ninety-year old crane. Not been able to face her family, Sophie flees the town and makes her way to the mountains. Along the way she meets a living scarecrow who leads her to a strange walking castle. Entering it, she is amazed to find out that the castle belongs to Howl...",

This review will contain some spoiler from the book and the\nmovie.\n\nSome of you probably wonder what it means when I say Miyazaki strikes\nanother Nausicaa but give the movie 5 stars, well Howl's Moving Castle\nis another disappointment to me. Nausicaa, Hayao's own story was\nbutchered by Hayao so I couldn't expect much when it came to some one\nelse's story. Now let me be the nail that can not be hammered down with\nthe praises this movie wrongfully receives.\n\nWhen I first thought about writing my review I was thinking to start\nwith this line \"Come one, come all and witness your favorite childhood\nstory being murdered in the most horrific way possible\". Well I changed\nmy mind. While I do not think that the movie version of Howl's moving\ncastle is by any means a good movie I do not think that it is the worst\nthing out there either.\n\nHowl's Moving Castle that Hayao Miyazaki created surely is a bold move,\nit was taking on an already well known work and was destined to be\nfaced with lots of nostalgic and overly obsessed fans and maybe that is\nwhy the movie is so weird and different from the original book. I mean\nsure Hayao Miyazaki's worlds have always been weird but you could\nexplain them easily (except Nausicaa's movie) but with Howl's Moving\nCastle he took a step over the border to the gaga land.\n\nHowl's moving castle is beautiful, colorful and alive but it is also\nuninspiring and a re-skin version of Miyazaki's other movies. I believe\nthat to escape the comparison between the book and the movie Miyazaki\ndecided to create a retelling of the story which is loosely based on\nthe book.\n\nThe movie is emotional and the beautiful soundtrack composed by Joe\nHisaishi helps you feel the emotions even better however that is all\nthe movie is. A big 2 hour long Japanese anime filled with emotions\nthat are not even justified. Sophie falls in love with Howl in no time,\nfeels sad for him, tries to save him and saves him. Is Sophie a complex\ncharacter? Well she used to be but then Japan's Walt Disney decided to\nturn her into a shallow character that we get nothing from but sobbing,\nsmiling and calling Howl's name constantly. Is she heroic? well not\nreally, is she the depressed character in the book? nope she is fine.\nShe is a very normal person, she can actually even switch between her\nold grandma state to a little bit less older woman and the 19 year old\ngirl state on the get go. The character is never believable and you do\nnot really feel for her. You really do not feel for anyone of them. The\nstory also does not help here. You already know that I am disappointed\nwith the movie being so different from the original work but I would\nhave been fine if we had received something like Akira in which you at\nleast get some story line, even the weak story line that Nausicaa of\nthe valley of the wind had would be fine but we get nothing. There is a\nwar going on (going ahead of the books are we Miyazaki sensei?) and\nsince this is a Miyazaki movie we must have that anti war message too\nbut OK still there must be a place to improvement right? WRONG! That's\nit. A war is going on, everything else is just there. Witch of the\nwaste? pfft, she is not the real villain she was just there to put the\ncurse on Sophie for the sake of plot, I am sure Miyazaki would rather\nhad her not be a part of the movie just like Martha, Sulliman, Prince\nJustin of Ingary!!!, Howl's place of birth WALES! and other stuff like\nmagic and stuff, who wants that right? All that matters here is the war\nthat is going on and how bad it is. Howl is not really worried about\nthe Witch of the Waste that 5 minutes in sent a curse for him through\nSophie, he is more concerned with the bombed cities of the coast lines.\nHowl does not fight a magic duel with Witch of the Waste in Porthaven\ninstead fights a legion of flying creatures that once were wizards but\nsubjugated themselves to the kind and Mrs. Pentstemmon, Woops I meant\nMadame Sulliman. We do not read about Sophie's emotional struggle's\nwith being the oldest and being cursed and also jealous because Howl is\na pimp but we get a 10 second scene in which Sophie goes under the rain\nand cries after Howl's outburst with slime but it is resolved as I said\nin 10 seconds when \"Markl\" comes to deliver the message that Howl needs\nhelp.\n\nThere is no way to feel any connection with any of these guys, Markl is\nunderdeveloped, Howl is underdeveloped, Sophie is just there for no\nreason and the list goes on.\n\nYou can not believe that this is a movie by the guy that made Spirited\nAway. As I said the scenery is beautiful and even though I would rather\nhave the castle from the book movie's castle is interesting too and the\nmusic by Joe Hisaishi is just perfect but that is all this movie has\ngot for it.",

Howl's Moving Castle \n\nDespite excelling as one of the studio's most well-known animations (and for good reason), Howl's Moving Castle has not altogether escaped some rejection. It has been called 'overrated', 'lengthy', and 'incomplete', none of which I disagree with. However, what these critics have failed to worship, is some of the most imaginative Ghibli characters ever created, not to mention the sheer volume of them. Remember: the helpful Turnip Head; Heen the asthmatic dog; the revolting Witch of the Waste; Calcifer the comedic fire; the dynamic steampunk castle itself; and, of course, Howl with his charming flamboyance and eccentric insecurities. Even the 18 year old Sophie is a complicated and memorable addition, changing ages as she confidently leads the delightful adventure, empowering young female viewers in her stride (an obvious intention by her very design). So, naturally, it should come as no surprise that with such a daunting cast, there wasn't all that much time to develop each character properly, but while the heartfelt journey may be muddled, it's never boring, and is yet just another perfect movie for kids and adults alike. Watch this one twice. \n\nTo read the rest of my 'Worst to Best: Studio Ghibli' list, click here: http://juicenothing.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/worst-to-best-studio-ghibli.html",

            "content": "\"They say that the best blaze burns brightest , when circumstances are at their worst.\"\r\n\r\nI know I've stated in the past that Howl's Moving Castle is my all-time favorite Studio Ghibli film. Well then, if I loved the film so much, then why does the rating say 80%? Well, it's because my thoughts on the film has changed since I first saw it. Something like this rarely happens when watching a movie, especially if I first watched a film, like, two years ago, but after rewatching Howl's Moving Castle, I realized that this isn't really a great masterpiece that I've been ranting about for the past year on RT. But that doesn't mean that I now hated the film. It's just that there were things that weakened the film a little bit, but just like some of Ghibli's greats, like Nausicaa and Porco Rosso, Howl's Moving Castle features a grand sense of imagination and the animation is another A+ from the legend Mayazaki.\r\n\r\nSet in a magical steampunk world dominated by witches and wizards, we meet Sophie, a young girl who works in a hat shop who's depressed about her looks. She gets a little spirit up when she briefly meets the strange wizard Howl, who travels around in a walking castle, but afterwards, Sophie is cursed by The Wicked Witch of the Waste by a spell that turns her into a 90-year-old woman. To break the curse, she travels to Howl's castle, and soon learns that her time in the castle can make a difference for the magical kingdom in general, particularly the friendship between her and Howl.\r\n\r\nOut of all the Ghibli films I've seen, Howl's Moving Castle clearly has the best voice casts that I've heard. We have Christian Bale as Howl, Emily Mortimer as the normal Sophie, Jean Simmons as the elderly Sophie, Lauren Bacall as the Witch of the Waste, Billy Crystal as Calcifer the fire demon, and Josh Hutcherson as Howl's young apprentice. Everyone involved does a great job in their parts, particularly Bale (who uses his Batman voice in one point), Simmons, Bacall, and especially Billy Crystal, who like Mike Wazowski, is the scene-stealing highlight.\r\n\r\nWhat I enjoy about Hayao Mayazaki is that he gives us the grand imagination in all of us, and he succeeds, even in films that I don't enjoy too well, like Ponyo. Howl's Moving Castle is no different, and this is the greatest accomplishment in this movie. With all its flaws (which I'll get to in a moment), Mayazaki does a fantastic job at wowing us at his visual wonders, with the most amazing images being Howl's castle (which is the best visual wonder I've witnessed in a film made outside of America), the witch's blob-looking henchman, Howl's bird form, and the design of Calcifer. Mayazaki also does a great combination in adding elements of mystery, romance, action, comedy, and drama throughout the film. Joe Hishashi's score, like most of his other scores, is fantastic in bringing us into to the fantasy world of Mayazaki.\r\n\r\nAnd while there's some visually wonderful things about this film, spectacular animation doesn't mean the rest of the movie is great. There's some flaws in this film, and they're scattered throughout so much that it weakens my final score of the film. For one thing, there's too many obnoxious subplots that distracts its main narrative, such as political conflicts about a missing prince and some ruler named Sulliman who doesn't care too much about corrupt wizards. While the Howl character is a strange and interesting character, his reasoning for going to war to defeat the enemy doesn't connect well, as we're never told why there's a war to begin with and who the true enemy is. I thought the enemy was going to be the Witch of the Waste, as she curses Sophie in the first place, but then we're treated to this extremely pointless power elimination scene that really weakens the evilness of the character. It's a shame, because Bacall does a fantastic job at voicing a sinister character, and I wanted to see more evilness of her power, but what we ended up getting fails miserably. The biggest criticism comes from its ending, which to some, it's criticized for being extremely confusing. While I understand what Mayazaki was trying to do, I was annoyed at what happens afterwards, where we discover who the magical scarecrow truly is, in a scene that rips off Beauty and the Beast. It's something that's so easy that makes the movie that more complicated to praise about.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, it sounds like I have a ton of complaints about Howl's Moving Castle. In reality, while there's certainly some flaws in this film, from dumbed down villainy, to a weak ending, to some boring subplots, in the end, Howl's Moving Castle is still a good Mayazaki film. It's animation is stellar, the imagination stays strong, and the voice casting is never better. While it's not as strong as Mayaki greats as Nausicaa and Ponyo, it's a whole lot better that that overrated, disgusting, Little Mermaid-ripoff mess called Ponyo.",

The story is told very well in Miyazaki point of view with an interesting setting set in the world filled with magic and machines. I was surprised to see that Mamoru Hosoda, director of the Digmon series and Summer Wars, was originally going to direct this film. But drop out of the project leaving it to Miyazaki. I would want to see Hosoda version, but the story to Miyazaki version is okay. I do wish there were more detail with the war going on in the movie, but the story is still strong with a few Miyazaki elements. The animation however is glorious to look at, especially the moving castle. Probably the most detailed design I've seen since Castle in The Sky. The animation really fits into the world of Howls Moving Castle with a European type of feeling than the usual Japanese culture. The character are well develop with great English voice actors like Christen Bale as Howl. Sophie is a well creative character with her being cursed into a old lady with different types of emotion that allows her to grow young again. If I had to find one character annoying, it would have to be Billy Crystal as \nCalcifer. At first he's really annoying, but grows less annoying throughout the film. I think the Billy Crystals voice doesn't match the character. Howls Moving Castle is not the best Miyazaki film, but it's enjoyable to watch for both anime and non anime fans.",

The film follows Sophie, a hat maker and oldest daughter of a flighty debutant mother, as she toils with the Witch of the Waste, who casts her into an old lady. Voyaging away from her village, she comes across the infamous \"moving castle\" inhabited by a young boy named Markl, a living flame demon named Calcifer that powers the castle, and the wizard, Howl. Together, they venture across the English countryside as Howl takes it upon himself to fly off as a giant eagle, in hopes of ending a war that is approaching. But the more he becomes this eagle, the greater chance he has of being stuck in that form, and for that, Sophie, who has fallen in love with Howl, struggles to find the key to breaking the spell on him as well as on herself. Not the most straightforward of narratives or even deliveries, Miyazaki fumbles with projecting the character of Sophie, often dropping the old age on a whim and making her young again to serve the plot. However, the characters are very rich and mysterious, helped in large by being based off a novel of same name by Diana Wynne Jones. Miyazaki's animation is rich in color and depth, bringing to life these strange worlds that breathe real from his paint brush (before be digitally enhanced), and etching yet another milestone in his illustrious career.",

            "content": "I am no more or less enthusiastic about Hayao Miyazaki after watching Howl's Moving Castle. The movie never comes close to scaling the heights achieved by Princess Mononoke, but it also isn't anywhere near as unbearable as Spirited Away. It's a perfectly fine movie. It excels in all the ways you would expect (fantastic animation, original storytelling, and so on), but it also has some common problems I've noticed in all the Miyazaki movies I have seen (random subplots, unclear mythology, underdeveloped and rushed romance, etc.). So when everything is added up, Howl's Moving Castle is an all right piece of filmmaking that fails to leave much of an impression.\r\n\r\nAfter the \"Wicked Witch of the Waste\" places a curse on a hat maker, young Sophie transforms into really old Sophie. After going from around 18 to around 90, Sophie travels into the wastelands in an attempt to transform back. There, she becomes a passenger on Howl's moving castle. This Howl has his own curse problems as well. As our narrative unfolds, magic, war, family, and romance all blossom under Miyazaki's lovely eye for visuals. \r\n\r\nThe plot was decent, but I felt that not enough was explained. Characters changed motivations too quickly. Characters' motivations aren't explained to begin with. And a big problems lies in the \"grand finale.\" *Spoilers* If I understand it correctly, Sophie finds a way to glimpse into the past. There she sees Howl as a boy. Right before she falls back into the present, she pleads with Howl to find her in the future, for his own deliverance. So if Sophie finds herself in Howl's past, she is only there because of her interaction with Howl in the present. So if Howl purposefully sought out Sophie at the beginning of the movie because he knew that she could deliver him from his curse, then what caused Sophie, in the past, to seek out Howl in the first place? The more you think about it, the more totally screwed up the time-line feels. The story was good enough up to this point, but the last half hour is so confused and, quite frankly, awful.\r\n\r\nIt comes as no surprise, but Miyazaki's visual style is just as enticing as ever. Howl's castle is a gloriously Steam Punk piece of imagination! As are all of the flying ships. The characters have a bit more visual personality than I've seen from Miyazaki in the past. I love how dedicated Miyazaki is to the worlds he creates.\r\n\r\nThe cast definitely consists of the most \"big names\" of any Miyazaki movie I've seen. Christian Bale, Jean Simmons, Lauren Bacall, Josh Hutcherson, and Billy Crystal make up the main cast. Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors. His voice doesn't immediately seem right for Howl, but it works surprisingly well. Jean Simmons is very spunky as old Sophie. But the best performance is Billy Crystal as Calcifer! Crystal is always so amusing!\r\n\r\nThe movie has a very vague \"moral of the story.\" It seems like Miyazaki is trying to say something deep about war throughout the movie, but his ideas are very clouded. What part does Howl play in the war? Who's fighting who, and why are they fighting? Why does the war end so suddenly? Why does Howl falling in love with Sophie change anything for Madame Suliman? What makes the war inherently bad? The movie never does a good enough job explaining why the war is happening to make me disapprove of it. War is hell, we all know that. But some wars happen for an important reason. So why is the war bad in this movie? I'm sure there's a good reason, but we're never told.\r\n\r\nLet me run through the rest of my problems with this movie. Other than the incredibly weak and confused third act, and the also confused moral, the story is lazy and not all that interesting. It's bland, and I failed to care about most of it. It's all pleasant, but it never evoked any passion from me. There's relatively little drama, and the movie didn't hit me on an emotional level. There are quite a few plot holes. One of many is Sophie's curse. How does she break it? She slips in and out of being an old woman, and nobody bats an eye. There's no, \"Hey Sophie, you're young again!\" Nope, Miyazaki is fine with letting his characters be completely oblivious about the changes. Then there's \"The Wicked Witch of the Waste.\" What's the point of her? The only contributions she has to the story are bad. And yet, Sophie and Howl are perfectly fine with letting their nemesis into the castle. Why exactly? Very few of the character's motivations make sense. Oh and one last thing, the scarecrow falls in love with a 90 year old woman ... What the heck!? He's still the young prince underneath. I can understand Howl falling in love, because he knows the truth from the start (or at least I think he does), but the prince? Whatever, it's not worth philosophizing about.\r\n\r\nOne constant of quality in all Miyazaki films (along with the visuals) is Joe Hisaishi's amazing music. Once again, he outdoes himself! I've really become quite obsessed with Hisaishi's music since I watched Spirited Away. He's amazing, and his score here is incredible as well. The theme for the movie is flawless. It's got a bit of a French vibe, and it's outstanding! At least I can count on hearing an amazing score, each and every time I watch a Miyazaki movie!\r\n\r\nI don't hold any hard feelings toward Howl's Moving Castle. It's an entirely agreeable experience for the first two acts. Though the last act does torpedo the rest of the movie, it's still really not that bad. But I can't help feeling how bland this movie was. Along with a laundry list of problems, and an almost throwaway story, this movie fails to leave much of an impression. Forgettable is a good word to use. So far, I've seen the \"Awful Miyazaki\" with Spirited Away, the \"Great Miyazaki\" with Princess Mononoke, and the \"Mediocre Miyazaki\" with Howl's Moving Castle. \r\n\r\n\"A heart's a heavy burden.\" 5/10",

From the moment I saw the image of that crazy moving castle I knew I had to see this film. I wasn't let down...\nCombining elements of magic, steam punk, romance, fantasy, witches and wars, this film is truly a delight on so many levels.  Dealing with politics, relationship problems, good versus evil in a world where good and evil might be one in the same, and having them all rolled into one congruous mishmash of relatability, Howl's Moving Castle is full of lessons to be learned while still delivering a magical mystery tour of a far far away place. \nThe imagination is let loose in this film with vibrant colours, weird yet familiar people, places and objects and an absolutely breathtaking piece of animation.  Each character shows a slightly different design style common to different types of anime which makes them unique and yet familiar at the same time. \nTruly a gem in the Ghibli library and comes with a high recommend from yours truly. I'll be watching Howl's Moving Castle again... and soon!",

I yet again didn't know anything about this film before I pressed the play button on the DVD.

The Vain and Vengeful witch of the west, jealous of her friendship, puts a spell on Sophie.\nThe opening sequence is awesome, you get this lovely music and approaching in a fog is the moving castle. You meet Sophie who likes working her mother's hat shop and she meets Howl who safely guards from some foolish guard, but the witch of the waste puts a spell on her taking her youth.\nThis Ghibli film is based off a novel written by Dianna Wynn Jones and now I feel like reading it. The top notch animation is just as breathtaking as it is,but it's always these characters that drive these movies. Sophie has the greatest character depth that with Howl. When she changes from old and young face she changes attitude or emotion. Howl changes from man to a type of bird and all his life he has hidden from his enemies because of he's losing purpose. I give Howl's Moving Castle a five out of five.",

            "content": "With the rising success of Spirited Away, the highest grossing film to ever reach Japanese history, there seemed to be a roller coaster of ups and downs.\n\nPrincess Mononoke, everybody saw.\nMy Neighbors the Yamadas, bought them time, and was an overwhelming success.\nAnd Spirited Away was their grandest masterpiece that they have ever accomplished, could the cycle be stopped?\n\nWell, Howl's Moving Castle, took a different route. Not only was this film was just as good, if possibly better than Spirited Away for some people's opinions, but it also attempted to compete with Spirited Away as well by being nominated for Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Did it win? Nope. Which in my opinion, I'm still looking for another film to compete with Spirited Away which in my past review, is why I'm jealous of the film. Do I think it's better than Spirited Away? Eh, no. I mean Howl's Moving Castle did have SOMETHING to like about it, but, with Spirited Away's original story battling a movie that is adapted from a book, rather a novel, it's almost impossible for the film to step up to the plate to bat. Well, let's look at what we have here...\n\nWe have a teenage girl named Sophie Hatter, which is ironic because she works in a hat shop during a war, she meets a young man named Howl, who's rumored to steal people's hearts, but he's not as intimidating as people think, he's actually a respectable, nice and trustworthy man. However, the Witch of the Waste makes trouble, turning Sophie into a ninety-year old woman; the only way to break the curse is, go see Howl who lives in a moving castle. Along the way she meets a scarecrow named Turnip, a fire demon known as Calcifer, and a young boy Markle. In which Howl may in fact have a secret of his own to hide. If Sophie can break the curse on Howl, Calcifer and the castle, Sophie will be restored to her original form, and that's it. \n\nFirst off, I'm not even going to comment on the animation because it looks as much as the same as Spirited Away, its good. Cool. I have to address this because I've read a couple mixed reviews for this film. I say this, because I feel if you do not read the book, that I'd be spoiling too much, but the film in itself is a little too questioning, what I mean to say is that, you begin to ask a lot of unanswered questions, and, without knowing the source material, your kind of left hanging, I'm not so sure if I should read the book, or, know if there is something missing here. But the fact that Howl's Moving Castle needs your undivided attention is a bit of problem, it's like you HAVE TO READ the book in order to watch it. \n\nAs a film does it hold up? Well, yes and no. There are a lot of things that work and the characters are memorable and likable, their funny, their voices are nice to listen to, especially when you have comedian Billy Crystal playing as Calcifer, who I gotta say is the funniest part in the movie. Then there is stuff that, doesn't work. Take for instance, NOT KNOWING CERTAIN THINGS as I said before you really begin to ask a lot of questions.  \n\nThe music, in Howl's Moving Castle is great, hey, its Joe Hisaishi and he brings a ballroom dance type motif to the picture and it's a very catchy tune.\n\nThe animation, great. The story, a little jumbled, but great. The characters, memorable. This is a good movie IF and ONLY IF you have read the book.\n\nOH, yeah. Join me in my next review.... :P",
