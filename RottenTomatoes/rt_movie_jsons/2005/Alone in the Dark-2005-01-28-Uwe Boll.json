The acting is stale, the characters have no depth to them, the special effects are clunky, the dialogue is absolutely horrifying and the directing is even worst. But the worst part about it all is that the film's plot is just absolutely confusing. It makes no sense what so ever. This is the type of film which is so bad that it actually made me angry at the end. It's not even so-bad-it's-good material, it's just really painful to sit through. Overall, director Uwe Boll has proven to us that he hasn't got a clue on how to make a movie, and it's a very good thing that he recently retired from the filmmaking industry. This sorry excuse of a horror/action movie is an insult to cinema itself, and it rightfully deserves to be called one of the worst movies ever made. Stay away from this terrible waste of time...",

The only complaints that I have with the movie are the directing, Tara Reid's performance, and the unnecessary sex scene between Christian Slater and Tara Reid, but these are all pretty minor.

            "content": "There is so little that works in \"Alone in the Dark\" that you would think it would be easier to just list the things the movie did correct but you'll be hard-pressed to think of anything. The story is a mess, but here goes anyway: Thousands of years ago, an ancient people named the Abkani opened a doorway into another dimension filled with monsters. The people managed to seal the door but it came at a terrible price and the entire civilization vanished. Our story follows Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), a former paranormal investigator under Bureau 713 who is investigating his past and researching a series of Abkani artifacts. As more and more artifacts are discovered, it becomes clear that someone is trying to assemble them to re-create the key to the other dimension. Edward, along with Aline Cedrac (his ex-girlfriend, played by Tara Reid) and members of Bureau 713 must stop the mysterious forces at work before it's too late.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the film you can tell this is going to be bad. The movie begins with a long text crawl explaining about the monsters, the Abkani and what happened thousands of years ago. This is a movie! Why can't we see this instead of hearing about it? Not only that, but the whole text crawl is narrated Christian Slater as well. Why? After wracking my brain I was able to come up with a brief outline of the plot but the story is incredibly difficult to follow. Several plot elements are very vaguely mentioned or are quickly introduced then dropped. There are side plots involving conspiracies, human-monster hybrids, past relationships between the characters and more that often lead nowhere, do not pay off or seem to contradict the actions of the characters. It doesn't help that the acting is pretty bad (the worst offender being Tara Reid) and the special effects are terrible. It's not that the monsters look all that bad, they're nothing special but decently made; it's the little things that just scream \"amateur hour\". For example, there's a scene where a zombified woman is running towards a character and she's gunned down with a single bullet to the head. If you're paying even the littlest amount of attention though, you'll notice that the bullet (which was added digitally) doesn't even come close to hitting its mark so she just falls over for no reason. Obvious, unexplainable bloopers like that one can be seen here or there during the film. A perfect example is a scene towards the end where a character is killed due to incompetence, the characters leave the room with the body and you can see the the actress begin to get up again before the shot is cut. Did director Uwe Boll never hear of a retake? It's like no one cared or was paying attention movie. My favorite bad moment is a seduction scene between Tara Reid and Christian Slater that is so bad, it's LEGENDARY. So here's the setup: The two of them haven't seen each other for years and they've just been attacked at the museum. They part ways and he goes back to his house, which is some kind of warehouse to rest. For unknown reasons, he leaves the door unlocked (despite having been attacked by strangers multiple times during the day) and his ex-girlfriend, who really resents him because his arrival marked her near-death at the hand of xenomorph-knockoffs, walks in. She finds him sleeping and then starts making out with him. We then have a soft-core sex scene (no nudity, the one thing that could have at least been somewhat enjoyable) and it fades to black. Why? Shut up. That's why.\nBeing badly acted, with shoddy special effects and an incoherent plot would have been enough to dismiss the movie as trash, but it gets even worse because \"Alone in the Dark\" is boring. It's never thrilling because the mysterious activities by the villains don't make any sense and are never explained. It's never exciting because the action sequences are so badly put together and the characters so bland you don't care about any of them. It's never frightening either. There isn't even a single scene where someone is alone in the dark and frightened. What does that tell you? If all of the reasons I listed weren't enough, how about a couple more? We get some locked doors that only stay locked as long as the plot demands it, a scene where the actors talks about four photos but the camera shows five, totally inappropriate music that breaks the mood and leaves you scratching your head, a ton of destruction that doesn't mean a thing, badly written, stilted dialogue throughout, and as a cherry on top, an evil, child-exploiting nun. This woman ran an orphanage and sold the children off to a mad scientist so he could experiment on them. What kind of experiments? Well our villain wanted to create half-monster, half-human hybrids... of course! When the actions of this film begin to play out, our evil nun suddenly begins feeling bad about her actions and ends up committing suicide. If you're going to be an evil nun, at least commit to it! \nHonestly, I thought this movie was going to be a lot of fun to ridicule, but it really wasn't, it's just plain awful. I can't recommend that you check this movie out for any reason, even morbid curiosity because even though there are moments where it is so bad it's laughable, it really is a dull, dreary experience to watch it. Among Uwe Boll's films, \"Alone in the Dark\" is one of the worst and that's saying something. (On Dvd, July 5, 2013)",

The acting was absolutely atrocious and one note throughout. Christian Slater delivered a dull performance, Stephen Dorff gave a bland performance as a bland FBI agent, and every scene with Tara Reid was painful to sit through because every time she talked she sounded like a robot and she has got to be one of the worst actresses I have ever seen in a movie in such a long time. The story and the way it was presented was just one note, convoluted, and confusing. It was hard to follow and everything that was happening didn't make any sense. The action here was terrible and badly shot and the cgi on the monsters was also terrible. There were too many scenes that were shot in total darkness (just like in Alien vs Predator Requiem) and as a result, you can't tell what the monsters fully looked like and there were times where you could barely tell what the monsters were doing to the humans. Why does Hollywood keep letting Uwe Boll make movies? He is one of the most untalented directors we have working in the business and he has never done a single good movie in his whole life. He is only doing movies to try to make a profit and there is not a single redeeming quality in his style. Hollywood can't seem to make any good video game adaptations and the most solid one I have seen was Doom. Overall, this movie ends up being one of the worst movies I have ever seen and in my opinion, this was even worse than House of the Dead. If you want to watch a great monster movie, watch James Cameron's Aliens and skip this piece of shit and you will be glad you did.",

They are all shot in such boring angels, that I almost fell asleep during them. Plus, they are literally shot in the dark so you cant tell what the fuck is happening. The special effects in this movie are so bad, even Stephen Sommers would say \"Damn do those effects look bad.\" There are parts so bad I almost felt embarassed, like in one scene a soldier was supposed to be dead and yet while people are walking away she lifts her head up. I mean, how did that get past editing?  Some people say that Uwe Boll is the new Ed Wood, no, at leat Ed Wood had a passion for filmmaking, Uwe Boll on the other hand just doesn't give a fuck.

I heard people don't like Slater much, I'm not sure why but even with that, he tried in this, he tried to make this better but not even the most valiant of efforts could save this. This movie didnt even feel real, it just felt like this movie was someone's dream because nothing had any weight, very little made sense and it was so over the top but underwhelmingly wooden at the same time. This movie has the problem of too much going on but at the same time not having a thing happen in it. I could write all the mistakes but I'm sure someone has, it's just juvenile mistakes that are in this, it's like a ten year old wrote the script. Theres just so simple errors. Theres also a giant error of not making a horror film scary but anyway. Some guy says something about three people but he's showing 4 pictures! WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THAT? It's just insultingly stupid. I'm not one for saying that someone's acting is 'bad' because I sure as hell couldn't do what they do but hell, I could have done a better job then what everyone did here, besides Slater, everyone was just too serious or not serious enough, wooden and bored. I've done some school plays in my time and that doesn't mean that I'm suddenly an acting expert but this stuff here was terrible. I still have no idea how I actually felt when watching it, because even though there were people with guns shooting things it just didnt feel real it just felt like scenes taken from other movies because everything was disjointed and I said earlier about it being like a dream because nothing seemed to matter... It's so bad it's a mystery... I just... No... I can't do it. I'm not just one of those people who follow the crowd and hate on it just because everyone else did, it's actually that bad... REALLY THAT BAD. I usually don't listen to critics either because I could be missing out on a gem just because some snob didnt like it but seriously they are right, STAY AWAY. IT'S GOT 1% FOR A REASON. It could have been good, even with all the negative things l heard and I kept an open mind because the synopsis of the film I read seemed interesting and the initial narration by Slater was intriguing but pretty much after he gets in that cab at the start it all falls apart. But, as I have to give it atleast half a star I will say that the soundtrack was very nice, for some reason it was a soothing soundtrack with very soft instruments and I liked that, too bad I can't find it anywhere. The music in the action scenes was awful and was so loud you couldn't hear anything and you couldn't even see anything because it was filmed in the dark (huh huh, get it?) but anyway I'm back on negatives. Oh, if you liked slo-mo, this is the movie for you.",

            "content": "Uwe Boll has been refer to as the new Ed Wood of cinema, these claims are completely false. At least with Ed Wood films you could laugh at his poorly made movie where Uwe Boll movies are just pathetic and a pain to watch. \r\n\r\nWhat's the best way not to start your movie? With a text crawl that last a minute and half read by a boring narrator. What's worse is our star is Christian Slater who you might as guess gives a Razzie Winning performance here. This movie is honestly filled with more wooden actors than wooden trees. The plot is essentially a contradiction of itself filled plot holes after plot holes. It's very stupid to say the least, non is more evidence with the scene when Slater is in a car chase and the taxi he's in won't start up. So if you have someone who's chasing you backing up their car to crash into you again, WHY in the world would you get out of the car in the direction the car is going to hit you. Yet despite us never seeing Slater chaser never getting out of the car, he disappears to only climb over a fence, walk on a bridge and then attacks Slater. Why he didn't attack Slater directly is anyone guess? The first action scene is very implausible, Slater shoots the guy chasing him with a gun several times including in the heart yet it's getting impale by a sharp object that kills him. This is surprisingly not the dumbest moment in the movie. What is the dumbest moment in this movie when am agent is showing Slater pictures of people that have disappeared he says that there are only 3 pictures, but, he actually showing him 4 people. The agent also says these three people have nothing in common expect they grew up in the same orphanage. IDIOTS! One very notable flaws comes from the ending in which an entire army of monsters which were never explained or shown attacked the city with entire evacuation of the city in one night. Yet somehow despite the monster attack the city is surprisingly clean with no indication of any destruction in the city. And it ends with Slater character being killed despite the movie constantly establishing the creatures weakness being light and this ending rips off The Evil Dead ending.\r\n\r\nAs for the horror aspect of the movie there really weak, Uwe Boll actually tries to scare people with flickering lights. There's also a scene in which it's film in a way in which someone is following Slater, but no ones actually which results in one of many completely pointless moments. You have better chance of being terrify by Casper the friend ghost even terrifying than anything in this movie. The worst element about the horror aspect is the heavy metal music which is out of place for this movie. As for the dialogue it's horrible. Some notable bad lines includes \"Just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it can't kill you\", well that's obvious. Another bad line includes \"If you're going to build a puzzle? Why hide the pieces so far apart?\", it's a puzzle of course it's to be hard to solve. The action scenes themselves are somehow even worst than Steven Seagal. Nearly every action scene is shot in the dark and terrible lightning makes sure you don't see what's going on. Everything is poorly done here from continuity errors, hue plot holes, poor direction, and nothing is right here. Yet despite it being a very poor movie, it did deliver some laughs with some priceless bad acting and a death scene in which a zombie is killed despite the bullet clearly flying over her head. It's one of most poorly made movie I've ever seen, but in all fairness I've seen allot worse than this.\r\n\r\nAs for this Uwe Boll being called the new Ed Wood must stop. Uwe Boll is in no way the new Ed Wood. Ed Wood actually has an audience that enjoy his movies no matter how poor they are where Uwe Boll does not have an audience for his very awful movies. If there's anyone you should compare Uwe Boll to is Jorge Ameer. You might be wondering who's Jorge Ameer is, he's a talent-less director much as the same level of Uwe Boll, but even worse. In case you don't believe me, just type in The Singing Forest and see what the community has to say about one of his better efforts.\r\n\r\nAlone In The Dark should stay in the dark there's no audience for this movie and there's hardly anything worth salvaging in this movie. Simply stay away from this movie, it's not worth you time.",

Anyways from what I gather from looking at the plot(if there was one), some experiments were experimented on some children with some pyschic abilities on a local house until one of them escaped resulting to the rest of them to escape as well.  Several years later and adults with them coming telekinetically linking them together to form a bond to seek answers of their existence with a squadron to assist them.

It's nothing more than just grabbing gamer's attention for the sake of making money, considering that he never plays video games in his life. No wonder why Alone In The Dark was a complete dreadful film. The story had nothing to do with the actual video game, so it doesn't look like Alone In The Dark to me. It just looks something else entirely. Even die hard movie lovers, like myself, will tell how bad this movie was. It was so bad that it's funny. It's right there with The Room and The Wicker Man remake. Everything from this film were laughable, from predictable acting, to the crappy special effects, and all the way to the cheesy dialogues.

            "content": "1.2/10\r\n\r\nUwe Boll's \"Alone in the Dark\" has nothing to do with the somewhat-forgotten and underrated 1982 slasher film of the same name. It is, instead, a big-screen adaptation of the popular video game franchise; which comes to no surprise, since Boll is infamous for merging video games with cinema and creating the most repulsively bad and intellectually assaultive pieces of shit ever. This is my first Uwe Boll film, and now I see why he has been greeted by such infamy; he deserves every last bit of criticism. Here, he's taken a good premise and rendered it stupefying and nigh impossible to watch. If there's one thing that makes it endurable, it's the amount of time you'll bust a gut laughing your ass off. Believe me folks; this one is a real stinker.\r\n \r\nSo the film opens with an overlong text that speaks of the back-story to the film, which is read aloud, to our dismay. The back-story involves an ancient tribe called the Abskani. Apparently, they worshipped otherworldly demons, who would take over the world upon being summoned. And now, they have finally been let loose onto the modern world, and we have to watch as Boll allows these badly animated CGI beasties to roam free and do little more than just kill people.\r\n\r\nBut of course, there must be characters; and oh man, are there ever. You've got a paranormal investigator (Christian Slater), his girlfriend (Tara Reid), and some guy in police clothing (Stephen Dorff) intent on being badass. He isn't.\r\n\r\nIs there even a need to name these individuals? Boll cares about them just about as much as I do. A few are given the kind of back-stories that should be considered necessary, even if they are lame all-the-same. Still, every single character feels out-of-place and born of a million clich\u00e9s; and the actors portraying them have each seen better days, or at least the mass majority of them have. They're just plain bad here; and they aren't even the worst to be found here when it comes to performances. No, if you know your bad movies; then you'll know that the acting that REALLY, REALLY sucks comes from the supporting cast. That's one thing that Boll seems to understand, but that's about it.\r\n\r\nI knew the movie was going to suck. I watched it because I was in the mood for something that was bad in just about every aspect of its being. So I can't say I'm disappointing when \"Alone in the Dark\", a film  with a perfectly interesting idea going for it, turns out to be an insanely illogical and disgustingly under-made little horror movie. Boll's idea of suspense seems to be some dimly lit places (often times, the dark cinematography seemed unintentional rather than the reverse) and slimy lizards and their worm offspring that pounce from the shadowy regions of the earth and kill you. Sure, that can be creepy and effective, but the director gets nothing right and screws up any possibility for goodness. It isn't entertaining and it isn't scary; with the exception of a gratuitous and poorly-filmed sex scene between Slater and Reid. Now THAT, my friends, is some scary shit.\r\n\r\nI have not played the Alone in the Dark video games, and by the looks of things, neither has Boll. The fans reacted negatively to the lack of faithfulness in the film adaptation's story; which is a load of bull otherwise. Nothing could have saved it or improved it in terms of quality; the fact that it doesn't even stick to the franchise that it's built around makes it all the more down-right pathetic. And as it is, I've said all I can say about \"Alone in the Dark\". I hated it; every moment of it. It's silly, stupid, and if you're going to watch it at all; watch it for the surplus of unintentional laughs. And whether you like it or not, a laugh is a laugh. And unintentional, guilty joy is the only emotion you'll feel when watching a movie directed by the master of cinematic crap himself. So embrace whatever you can feel and continue to detest the rest of the ride.  Where \"Alone in the Dark\" stands, as cinema, is all in the title.",

Sadly for a bad movie junkie such as me; Boll's 2005 trash fest wasn't as bad as I had feared, like BATTLEFIELD EARTH [2000] despite being irritating and rather annoying this film had its odd moments of un-intentional comedy. However the confusing and half-baked plot line which lacks a lot of continuity and logic, Tara Reid as a totally unconvincing scientist and of course the over use of slow-mo & strobe lighting during a gun battle make this a very bad film. Aside from the odd moment of un-intentional comedy I found this film weak which is why a solid rating of 30% is in order.",

It's not a bad one either. \r\n\r\nWith movies like these, if you can handle then it's either a test of your manhood or just plain stupidity. If you finish it you're either a man or just stupid for having watched it in the first place. Take your pick. It could be both. \r\n\r\nActing/characters: Well, I don't need to tell you how bad it is because you've heard it a million times before. The characters are very laughable and they have no motive for doing what they do at all. They make the stupidest choices without any reason at all. The acting is just as bad as the characters. I normally cut actors a bit of slack because bad acting is usually (not always) 50% a bad screenplay and maybe 25% a bad director who controls all of the emotions and acting choices of the actors. But that still doesn't change the fact that everyone in this movie acts as stupid as their characters are. 0/10 \r\n\r\nPlot: This plot is as nonsensical as you get. You're expected to know a lot of things that you are never told. They attach significance to a lot of things without telling the audience why they are important or what happens if things go wrong. Do the bad guys want to take over the world? Do they want to just kill the good guys and just leave it there? Who is behind it and why? Is the main villain we see just some pawn or a host body or is he the mastermind of all of this? Why do a highly trained army of government secret alien defense soldiers never have to reload and can't hit anything? The plot holes are bigger than George Clooney's head when he won Best Supporting Actor (the same year this came out actually). It was just a mess. Plus the ending just added another giant plot hole to everything. Nice going. I looked on 5 or 6 different websites trying to get a decent plot explanation for this film. I found pretty much nothing. I did find this though. It's as close as we're going to get. 0/10 \r\n\r\nBob B. The Movie Master's review:\r\n\r\nYou know how Uwe Boll is called the Hitler of filmmaking. They are exactly right. This movie looks so bad. I mean, he didn't get enough budget, didn't get a good solid cast and he forgot to make it true to the game. There seems as though there is some suspense in the trailer, but there isn't. I now declare Uwe Boll the Hitler of movie making! 2/10\r\n\r\nOverall Rating: 1/10",

All of his movies are proficient from a technical standpoint (you need look no further than the \"bullet time\" and xeno apartment assault sequences here to realize the guy has some genuine artistry to his credit). A Boll production is always an entertaining way to eat up an hour and a half... But seriously, the guy HAS to start reading his scripts prior to filming.\n\nNever is there any kind of characterization found in his movies (and hiring the likes of Tara Reid to bring the already flimsy characters to life does not help matters any). People just do things because the script demands it be so, not for any kind of plot or character-related motivation. That's not even to mention the giant gaps in the storyline itself. So many times did I find myself saying \"gee, I guess that person died... for some reason.\" idk. Maybe the guy just forgets to film stuff and doesn't realize he can go back for reshoots.\n\nSo yeah, Boll, you frustrate me to no end. Your movies could easily be better than they are.

What little storyline there is, is stretched out to fill the running time, but is so badly created, that at times it becomes unintelligible.  To be truthful, it was only when I read the description on Flixster that I actually understood what was supposed to be going on.  For any gamers out there have played an installment in the \"Alone In The Dark\" series, please, please do not expect a movie that will come anywhere close to what you would expect.

Alone In The Dark is one of the all-time worst horror films and action films I've ever seen. The storyline is horribly confusing, the acting is absolutely horrendous (Especially the acting by Tara Reid. Really, a fucking archaeologist? If she's an archaeologist, then I'm a fucking brilliant mathematician!), the action scenes are utterly boring (How do you make shooting monsters and zombies boring? HOW?!), and it is also far too boring and awful to be salvaged for trashy fun. I honestly couldn't believe just how awful this thing was and I watched the unrated director's cut, which is supposed to be the improved version! If that was the improved version, I hate to think of how much worse the theatrical cut is. It should also tell you how bad this film is when Uwe Boll himself said it was bad (Not to mention, as he stated in the commentary of the director's cut, that he also thought casting Tara Reid was a really bad idea). The only things I can really compliment about the film is the music score, the awesomely cheesy death metal soundtrack it spawned, and the kick-ass poster. Other than those things, there is nothing else positive I can say about this dire action/horror flick.",

When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something evil slipped through before the gate was closed. Twenty-two years ago, the Government Paranormal Research Agency Bureau 713 was directed by Professor Lionel Hudgens, who performed experiments with orphan children. On the present days, one of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby, who has just gotten an Abkani artifact in South America, and is chased by a man with abilities. When an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night, he discloses that demons are coming back to Earth. With the support of the anthropologist Aline Cedrac and the leader of the Bureau 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke, and his squad, they battle against the evil creatures.\r\n\r\nThis film is poor. Uwe Boll cannot direct something serious enough for me to care about. None of the characters are remotely interesting and the plot is so bland and lifeless its like they aren`t even trying. Uwe Boll doesn`t love films at all. He just uses it as a way to make cash no matter how terrible they are.\r\n\r\nChristian Slater has nothing to deliver on screen. There isn`t anything. No charisma,no sex appeal,no action...Nothing. He is just dull to watch. Tara Reid can barely act. She was fine in American Pie but in this,its clear she has just completely lost all talent when wearing those glasses (which don`t even look good on her).\r\n\r\nOverall laughable. Don`t take it seriously. Uwe Boll makes poor films that deserved to be trashed because he has no talent whatsoever.\r\n\r\nRating - 24% - C-",

Raised in an orphanage, he is prone to having nightmares that involve him as a child that he can't explain.  As the movie progresses, he finds he and the current Bureau 713 are searching for the same answers involving a long lost tribe called the Abkani and rare artifacts from their era that are being found throughout the world.\r\n\r\nA monster movie in the style of The Relic, but no where having the casting power of a Tom Sizemore or Penelope Ann Miller, this film tries to showcase its monster and does an ok job at it, however the rest of the film falls short.",

This is a film that fails to hit the mark on so many levels, it's not even possible to salvage even if you'd remove all the crap scenes with Tara Reid. Alone in the Dark is a misguided attempt at creating an action Horror film, and it fails. This is one film that just doesn't deliver. You end up wondering why this film wasf8inanced in the first place and you're astounded at how Boll could pull something like this off. Alone in the Dark is the prime example as to why Video game to screen adaptations are horrible ideas for films, and they rarely work. Alone in the Dark is a poorly made film and you realize that Uwe Boll doesn't care about directing a good film that he's only in the business for the money. His films sell, so there's no reason for him to direct a good film, although he's managed to make three good flick s out of the fifteen or so he's made. This might have been an interesting idea for a film if it would have been handled properly. There were signs of potential, but it quickly became apparent that it was a pure joke fest. Everything that might have been interesting is wasted from the poorly conceived script, which feels rushed, with no heart put into its story to the washed up actors; this film was set to fail right before the cameras were set to roll. Avoid this horror flick, as it a mess from start to finish, and there's nothing good to come out of it aside from the heavy metal soundtrack.",

A common complaint is the so called horrible performances from Christian Slater and Tara Reid.

The only reason it got 10% is on my computer you can't put 0%. Videos that you watch in Science and History class in school have better entertainment value than Boll's.

Yeah, if Mystery Science Theater 3000 was still around, it would not surprise me in the least if they riffed this.  To call this a campy B-movie would be giving it a compliment.  I don't blame Christian Slater for this; I know he can act (True Romance, Heathers), but I guess we all need a paycheck from time to time.  Although it never made me really angry like I thought it might, there is just no way of knowing how shitty this is without sitting down and seeing it for yourself.",

            "content": "You know when a movie is in trouble when its foreword lasts so long that you have trouble finishing the first five lines before the next five scroll up to replace them. Clearly, Lions Gate Films hired a narrator so that audiences could keep up. Sadly, the heavily detailed preamble in \"House of the Dead\" director Uwe Boll's newest video game masquerading as a movie \"Alone In The Dark\" is so obtuse that you may want to ignore it and wait for the characters to repeat bits and pieces of it in their dialogue. Frequently, producers add prefaces because they are afraid that there is no other way to convey such an abundance of back story. Seriously, who goes to the movies to read? Most people want to watch and react rather than read. This is why many moviegoers shun films with subtitles. Anyway, this derivative, below-average, formula-driven creature feature lacks the production values and the polish that German-born helmer Boll brought to his earlier epic \"House of the Dead.\" Believe it or not, \"House of the Dead\" looks like a four-star masterpiece compared to this largely humorless, overly complicated, clich\u00c3\u00a9d-ridden, supernatural claptrap about huge, leaping, cranium-crushing, lizards of the \"Alien\" variety that number into the thousands like the bugs in \"Starship Troopers.\" No, \"Alone in the Dark\" is neither bad enough to qualify as campy, like those guilty-pleasure, 1950s' sci-fi monster mashes, nor does it take the creature feature flick to the next level, like the vastly underrated \"Alien vs. Predator.\" Among a predominantly no-name cast, Christian Slater, Tara Reid, and Stephen Dorff appear to be killing time for a paycheck in this excuse for lots of second-rate blood & gore.\n\nFashionably unshaven, with a tattoo on one shoulder and a spaghetti-western duster draped over his buff physique, actor Christian Slater impersonates a haunted 'paranormal investigator' on the trail of a mystery about a lost Native American tribe called the Abskani. This advanced society thrived during the age of the hunters and gatherers. They opened a gateway between light and darkness and unleashed the spawn of Hell. As the Tara Reid character observes during a lull in the action: \"Some doors aren't meant to be opened.\" Could she have been talking about the doors to all the movie theaters where this substandard, superficial adventure is being shown? These hideous demons are supposedly so ghastly that the Indians locked them up in a gold-plated Pandora's Box. Designed as they are by a special effects company called Toy Box, the monsters appear pretty phony.\n\nAs a rough and tumble hero patterned in the Indiana Jones mold, Edward Carnby (Christian Slater of \"True Romance\") has just discovered an ancient artifact in the Amazon basin that promises to unlock the secrets of the Abskani and these demon lizards called Xenoes. Once Carnby deplanes, an apparently invincible assailant tries to relieve our hero of that precious relic. This thuggish brute takes a couple of 9mm slugs in the chest and shrugs them off like bee-stings. Carnby finally disposes of him by body-slamming him atop a large ice-pick. Unfortunately, this drawn-out match amounts to the best thing in this anti-climatic opus. Eventually, we learn from the hopelessly overwrought script (by Elan Mastai, Michael Roesch, and Peter Scheerer) that a crazed scientist, Professor Hudgens (newcomer Mathew Walker), abducted Carnby and nineteen other kids from a Catholic orphanage and used them as guinea pigs in his nefarious experiments. Hudgens wanted to merge man with nature as the ill-fated Abskani tried. After Walker forced a slimy, squirming, centipede-like critter down all their gullets that attached itself to their spines, Carnby managed to escape and kill his parasite. The other nineteen weren't as lucky. Twenty-two years later, amid nightmares, they drop what they're doing in their everyday lives and mutate into murderous ashen-faced zombies. Meanwhile, a trigger-happy, paranormal, SWAT-team style outfit called Bureau 713, headed by Commander Burke (Kiefer Sutherland look-a-like Stephen Dorff of \"Blade\"), wants to wipe out these dastardly devils. Inevitably, Carnby looks for help from his girlfriend, Aline Cedrac (an abominably miscast Tara Reid of \"American Pie\"), a brilliant but bespectacled archaeologist who wears clothes that bare her midriff but conceal her belly button. She also has a funny way of saying 'Newfoundland.' Although neither Slater nor she conjures up any chemistry as lovers, Reid has one great scene where she punches him out for failing to let her know about his whereabouts. This scene and the first fight scene are about as good as it gets.\n\nAlthough the overexposed, washed-out photography adds an edgy quality to the narrative, it makes everybody look unattractive in their pancake-thick make-up. The monsters don't appear very realistic and never pose a tangible threat. The gore is cheesy by anybody's standards. The dialogue sounds like a play-by-play commentary. The characters spend too much time telling us where the plot is propelling them or uttering inconsequential fluff to keep your attention from drifting. Most of the action occurs in a creepy mine shaft or an abandoned warehouse. At least, \"House of the Dead\" was fun, while \"Alone in the Dark\" suffers from a case of prefabricated plot. Slater and Dorff both bring more dignity to this mediocre movie than it deserves. Meanwhile, this swiftly-paced, 96-minute potboiler reaches its predictable climax without arousing the least bit of sympathy for our heroes or modern civilization.\n\nExpect to see \"Alone in the Dark'' on the Sci-Fi Channel where the commercials will provide some relief from this noisy tedium.",

As the film started I first noticed the camera quality wasn\u0092t up to scratch but I put up with it. The acting in the film was dreadful and I was laughing from the minute the taxi driver opened his mouth, it\u0092s a real pity because I like Christian Slater allot especially his direct to DVD movie The Good Sheppard but this is completely terrible and what the hell was he wearing? I\u0092ve never seen a less heterosexual attire in a movie ever; he certainly didn\u0092t pull of that tank top he had to wear.\r\n\r\nI tried to remain optimistic about the film but when the first fight scene come into the play I just wanted to cry. The music used was absolute horrendous and every time even a punch was thrown the slow motion would be used, I bet if they put the slow all those scenes to regular speeds you would iron out a good ten minutes of the film. The fight scene reminded me of the plot from a porn film (Jenna Jameson\u0092s pirate film called Conquest in particular) just without the actual entertainment after the scene is set...\r\n\r\nThere was one particular part(s) of the film that had me laughing, every time they discovered a secret artefact or whatever it was this cheesy magical wind shim sounding noise would play to basically tell you, the viewer, that this little pebble the guy is currently holding is special. During the film you will see one sex scene which starts with Tarra Reid attempting to erotically touch the scars that cover Christian\u0092s back, well that certainly wasn\u0092t sexy.\r\n\r\nI wondered and better wondered what the $20,000,000 budget for this film was spent on; I mean there didn\u0092t seem to be that much CGI that would take up all the money and it was almost like they cut the budget in certain areas to save money but that was just Uwe\u0092s lack of abilities leaking through. Towards the end there is a last desperate gamble that was obviously an attempt to copy the film Alien in which a black sloppy monster is hanging from the ceiling and when our poor victim turns round he gets a face full of teeth.\r\n\r\nThe strangest thing about this film yet is after severely disliking this I started getting curious of Uwe Boll\u0092s other \u0091films\u0092 as he defiantly is the modern equivalent of Ed Wood and at least his passion is to be admired.",

Horror, according to my little unabridged here, is \"an overwhelming and painful feeling caused by something frightfully shocking, terrifying or revolting; a shuddering fear\".  So now that we've established what is horrific, let's get the following out of the way; this movie is horrific, in every sense of the word.  You won't find yourself contemplating supernatural horrors, or even the depths of human depravity during the few minutes you will be able stomach this bile.\n   Instead the horror will stem from absolutely horrid casting (Tara Reid as an archeologist, if wearing glasses and slapping a keyboard whilst saying inane things like \"I THINK ITS ABKANI, IT MIGHT BE ABKANI, IT'S ABKANI\" counts as archaeology), locations that look like the same set converted multiple times for the variety of purposes, props that are . . . laughable (all of the soldiers are wearing painball gear complete with elbow and knee pads and the ancient artifacts are cast of a crappy crappy resin mold), the extras have no idea where they're supposed to be \"shooting\" and so the action scenes, already bogged down by misplaced heavy metal, and .5 second camera cuts that prevent anything from being actually seen other than rifle blooms and the occasional poorly rendered CG ugly thing, and then we come to the acting.  If there were poorer acting in this film, which is about on par with a very bad SciFi original production, I might be inclined to recommend it as a good drinking game movie.  There is, however, nothing worth redeeming in this piece of utter trash.  Alone in the Dark has nothing of what made the vintage video game series so appealing, as the crew seemed to be intent on making an action movie from a horror video game.\n   If the opportunity to watch this movie ever presents itself, do something more fun and productive; like smashing your head against the wall, or jumping off a roof.",

It's cool to watch if you have absolutely nothing to watch during daytime hours when all that's on is soap opera television, but no other reason.",

Its another crock of shit Directed (and i use that would lightly) by Uwe Boll. This man couldnt direct an old lady to the post office as he's making a career out of directing ham fisted Video game adapts. The lighting is awful, the use of slow mo action shots is awful and everything else between is awful. I have flushed more artistic efforts down the toilet.

The cast are admirable but both Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff are criminally wasted in this as they negotiate a not too complex storyline about stopping some old guy from opening a gate way to a hell world and letting loose even more of the Aliens rip off creatures which are not even in the slightest bit terrifying to begin with.\r\nThis is a poor movie by normal standards but maybe its too harsh to judge it as so, because as brainless, late night rubbish it is kinda adequate.",
