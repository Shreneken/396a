Legend of Drunken Master and Looney Tunes were both heavily inspired by the physicality of vaudeville, commedia dell'arte, and slapstick and thus were similar enough in style to be a \"peanut butter and chocolate\" combination. \nRegardless of how much you want to look into it, Kung Fu Hustle is a fun, hilarious and well-directed movie that everyone should see.",

Only now I decided, however, to watch it in its full glory, and suffice it to say that it did not disappoint me one bit. I had a plethora of thoughts that evening: how is it that this kind of parody has such splendid sets and costumes? Why it has such great plot and so many silly moments at the same time? How is it that after half an hour full-on into the movie we still not have a clearly defined protagonist? Is this really just a comedy, or is there something more to it? And after the credits have rolled down I also came up with some answers: its not just a comedy, it is, hands down, a grand epic. But a grand epic set among people so ordinary, so common, so every-day that it changes our very perspective on this kind of cinema. Martial arts masters are here not great sages, but common people, kinda like Beggar So in \"Drunken Master\", and their art is practiced not in monasteries, but in the slums. And that is what makes Pig Sty Alley such a great cinematic location, and the climate of \"Kung Fu Hustle\" so uniquely enjoyable.",

            "content": "Absolutely insane combat with hilarious comedy!\n\nStephen Chow's martial arts comedy Kung Fu Hustle (2004) is a brilliant display of creative direction, skillful choreography, playful effects, and good humor. Chow impressed me greatly with one of the greatest comedies of all time: Shaolin Soccer. Kung Fu Hustle is right up there with it for me now as the absurd fight scenes and raunchy jokes are just hilarious. Chow's writing is super clever as he weaves in and out of the martial arts genre with comedy.\n\n Everything is ridiculous from punching someone from the sky to screaming people through walls. Kung Fu Hustle is going to make you roar with laughter. Chow is a genius director with clear influences of Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Gordon Liu, and The Looney Tunes. Chow finds every interesting angle and trick to pull off outrageous physical gags during all the martial arts mayhem.\n\nAngie Lam's editing is so quick and crafty that you don't even notice Kung Fu Hustle's brief 99 minutes fly by like a crane kick. Raymond Wong taps into old wuxia films with traditional Chinese instruments playing a beautiful score that sounds completely original. Poon Hang-Sang's cinematography is actually lovely with tender close-ups and humorous zooms. His wide shots are crazy and always find a new way to shoot a fight scene.\n\nStephen Chow is comedy gold as the lead in Kung Fu Hustle as the foolish Sing. His jaw dropping abilities are only matched by his perfect comedic timing for the slapstick gags. Yuen Wah and Yuen Qiu are unbelievable as the hilarious husband and wife Landlord and Landlady. Their special moves are funny, but their excellent acting keeps you chuckling along through the entire film. Lam Tze-chung is hilarious as the chubby sidekick to Sing. He's always good fun.\n\nI was really impressed by the versatile Bruce Leung Siu-Lung as The Beast. His crazy hand movements are just as scary as his toad style kung fu. Danny Chan Kwok-Kwan takes off his Bruce Lee cosplay from Shaolin Soccer to don an intimidating axe gangster leader persona as Brother Sum. Lastly, Eva Huang is drop dead gorgeous as the mute ice cream vendor with a mysterious past named Fong.\n\nIn all, Kung Fu Hustle is a worthy comedy and combat sequel to Shaolin Soccer without the soccer.",

            "content": "After rewatching the entire Ip Man series which had a grounded style of fighting, I've thought about a martial movie that was the opposite of that. I haven't watched this movie in ages but I remember it for being the most ridiculous movie ever. I decided to rewatch \"Kung Fu Hustle\" and it is still as grand and ridiculous as ever.\nWhen the hapless Sing (Stephen Chow) and his dim-witted pal, Bone (Feng Xiaogang), try to scam the residents of Pig Sty Alley into thinking they're members of the dreaded Axe Gang, the real gangsters descend on this Shanghai slum to restore their fearsome reputation. What gang leader Brother Sum (Chan Kwok-Kwan) doesn't know is that this neighbourhood doesn't take kindly to interlopers. \n\nLet's start with what makes this movie stand out from other movies, the comedy. This movie has very dark humour, for example, the axe gang leader kills two people with a knife and shotgun and then the next scene goes to them all dancing to a cool score by Raymond Wong. You're never really sure if you are meant to laugh or it is genuinely seriously but director Stephen Chow intertwine both together to create some weird humour but it just works. \n\nAnother part of the charm of the unique comedy is this movie is the surprisingly over the top slapstick, Looney tunes comedy. The director employs this by using very cartooney sound effects and having guys get hit around like toy ragdolls that result in some laugh out moments. There is a chase scene that feels like it is from Bugs Bunny. I don't want to spoil any of the moments if you haven't watched it but it's as crazy as it sounds and it's awesome. \n\nThis movie isn't just all comedy though and has some amazing fight/action scenes.  The director uses a lot of wirework and surprisingly a lot of CGI which is quite unprecedented in a martial art or even a comedy movie but it is used very effectively. The fight scenes are well directed and edited but best of all incredibly exciting and thrilling to watch. Despite all the wirework and CGI, every fight is completely visible with no over edits or shaky cam and in 2004 that was quite rare in action movies.\n\nThe movie was undoubtedly inspired by many American movies such as The Matrix, Spiderman and even The Shining. The director incorporates these very blatant references in the movie to the point that it seems like it is copying but yet it feels unique due to how the director utilises it. \n\nAll the actors in this movie are great including the director, Stephen Chow, who plays the main lead. Every actor including supporting actors embody the ridiculous nature and manage to stand apart from each other that even in the short runtime of 98 minutes, the audience can grasp every single character's personality and quirkiness in minutes. The set design is amazing as it represents the 1940's Shanghai and feels vibrant and alive. The costumes are great as they feel believable and manage to capture the personality of some of the characters. The score by Raymond Wong is incredible and captures the nature of the movie with one of the stand out being the Axe Gang music which will make you want to dance with it. \n\nIf there had to be a flaw in the movie then it has to be the lack of a coherent plot. The synopsis is the basic premise for the beginning of the movie but a lot of other different plot points happen to intertwine with this about other characters and then there is this other new plot happening in the third act which makes it feel incoherent. Another flaw would be the lack or very rushed character development which is in part due to its short runtime. Characters can completely change in personality in a matter of minutes without any real build-up towards it.\n\nBill Murray described this movie as \"the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy\" and honestly that is a fair assessment. I feel like there will never be another movie like this ever. The movie blends kung fu, CGI and cartooney humour to create what I consider is one of the most hilarious movies ever made. If you haven't watched it then I HIGHLY recommend you give this movie a watch!",

            "content": "There\u2019s no denying that I am a fan of Stephen Chow\u2019s style of comedy. Kung Fu Hustle has that perfect tone of a spoof film, and knows exactly how to use certain tropes of the genre it is parodying in order to create humor. I love the exaggerated way that kung fu works in this film, and how the most unexpected people or items can be dangerous. It\u2019s amplified to such a level that at times it feels like a live-action cartoon, and for me that is always good for a laugh. When I sit and watch a movie at home by myself, even a solid joke can struggle to get much more than a chuckle from me, but Kung Fu Hustle had me laughing out loud consistently. The other thing that Stephen Chow understands, is that even the best comedy needs plot and structure. There is a solid story in this film with genuine stakes, heroes and villains, and all the other hallmarks of a good narrative. I also appreciate his casting choices, because he doesn\u2019t go with all the obvious actors for each role, and allows for some unexpected heroes. I must admit, though, that Kung Fu Hustle contains one of my biggest pet peeves about movies. I always struggle when there are people in a story with seemingly limitless powers, or at least power that doesn\u2019t appear to adhere to any set of rules. While it\u2019s good for some comedic effect, I never get a feel for what move is more powerful than another. The final fight keeps escalating to a point that it feels like there is never a satisfying conclusion, because they both seem to recover from even the most devastating blows. I know it\u2019s supposed to be silly and over-the-top, so I didn\u2019t get that annoyed by this aspect, but it is a tad unclear when the fight will truly end and someone will win. My only other nitpick with Kung Fu Hustle was how late they brought the main character into his heroic role. His redemption arc starts so far into the movie that it barely feels earned. These are quibbles with an otherwise amazingly enjoyable film. I might not find Kung Fu Hustle perfect, but any movie that entertains me this much is one I\u2019ll watch again any time.",

I think in terms of pure entertainment, you can't go wrong with it. The goofy humor and ridiculous effects are a blast. It might be because I don't know the language and had to rely on subtitles, but I did feel the story was a bit hard to follow at times. Regardless, I was able to capture what the main story was and I was pretty on board with it. Anyway, this isn't really a movie you watch for the story. The main sell is how fast it moves and how it consistently delivers with comedic force. Overall, I think this is a fun movie that made me laugh and kept me very entertained.",

It's very much a case of style over substance, as the plot only serves to move us from one outrageous set piece spectacle to the next, and makes no bones about it. That's Chow's style, with far more focus on effects-laden fighting techniques than inscrutable storytelling, and it works for him. We're treated to dozens of unique forms, from countless unexpected sources, as nearly every denizen of a dusty, lower-class slum turns out to be a kung fu master of some sort. Most memorable, of course, is the chain-smoking old landlady, who batters every comer and effortlessly steals each scene without even pausing to pull the curlers from her hair. It's indulgent and silly, watery and childish, but it's also richly entertaining and singularly stylish. Great background party-viewing material. ",

            "content": "Satirical to Classic or Western Action Films\nHardly knows where it is going\nShift of characters, hard to connect\nStill funny, confusing\nSuperpower, cgi, cartoon\n\nI, despite being a lover of films with strong messages and deep/ disturbing themes, still enjoyed having to watch Kung Fu Hustle. I know this because even if this happened to be the fourth time I have watched it, I still found myself laughing and enjoying its many comedic elements and shallow jokes. Though the movie in itself is quite simple, such that it did not choose to delve into deeper themes and symbolisms, but made use of \"slapstick comedy\" as well as the idiocy of the characters as a means to tell a story that captivates the audience's attention. Through a constant flow of comic relief, not much thinking and analysis is needed by the audience to understand and appreciate the movie, thus even the most shallow movie-goers could be won over by the charm and the appeal of this film. At the same time, if one were to observe how the director chose to present the film, he or she did not go for the approach of being realistic, but mainly used their strength of going all out to make the film fiction. This is highly evident in how CGI was used to overexaggerate blows, facial expressions/ features, deaths, fightscenes and transitions. They even gave characters superpowers to make normal traditional chinese kungfu action scenes more appealing to western audience. With all these together, it does not only create the definition of comedy in both aspects of VFX, SFX and their characters, but the overall lighthearted atmosphere it gives off (even in dramatic scenes) is extremely entertaining, altogether earning around 6-7 stars in my opinion.\n\nBut it is also this innocent vibe which hides a greater satire to what the entire movie actually chooses to mock. Upon observing the film, one could notice that the film hardly knew where it was going. Even to myself, I felt the abrupt shift of characters and scenes far too confusing to be fully invested into the storyline. In one segment, we see the Axe Gang terrorizing the locals, in another, the conflict between the residents of Pig Sty, and later on, randomly, the main character shows up with a backstory and thus commences a standard hero's journey plotline. The flow of the movie could have been more organized,  but from this observation, I learned to see how this film chose to use satire and its jumbled up plotline to mimic and criticize the the nature of Western Media/ Films. Having to start with the Main Character, he deviates from the standard story of a Asian Hero's film from other movies by stripping his or her motivation of doing justice based on the commonly darker themes (ex. revenge, honor, etc.) found in many Eastern literature or films. Instead, we see the common Western ideals of being strongest in the hierarchy of power, shown by the competition amongst Kung Fu masters to be the best in the martial arts, The Beast (Leung Siu-lung) bowing to Sing, Sing wanting to feel powerful or self-confident by joining the axe gang (due to a traumatic experience of being overpowered by bullies), etc. This Western idea of power is repeated all throughout a film, and there is a rivalry between the characters to be on top. At the same time, there are also many factors that were added in the film to further appeal to the taste of Western audiences. These include such usages of CGI, which was not common in Chinese films produced in the years around when Kung Fu Hustle was made, there were the use of superpowers and superhuman abilities that brought taste to the overly used hand-to-hand combat which the Chinese have been so used in incorporating in their action films (and may look quite bland in the eyes of the West). Lastly, the director tried to fit as much stories and events possible in the span of the 1 hour and 40 minute film. Because it took at movie quite a long time before the main character was introduced, it was evident of how rushed the character development of Sing was. All at once we get the memory of how Sing tried to defend Fong, before one knows it, he gets beaten to a pulp, gains a mentor (Landlady and Landlord), becomes the supreme master of Kung Fu, and returns back to a normal life pursuing a humble goal of love. Altogether, this shows a clear resemblance to the hero's journey, a patterned plotline that is commonly used in movies such as those created by Marvel, DC, and western action movies; all of which are generally accepted by the public. \n\n\nI believe that this way of presenting the movie, in a comedic, crammed and shallow fashion was all intentional in having to criticize Western films today. The director made use of many tropes, clich\u00e9 events and comedic elements that are taken from Western genres to further enhance the appeal of this Asian/ Chinese film even to foreigners. It gave taste to ordinary chinese films, but also was satirical in order to exaggerate the Western qualities it shared. This was even done to the other works of Stephen Chow such as Shaolin Soccer or Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons. This strategy, at the end was successful, as it not only opened the minds for people to give more attention to the films created by the East, but also helped him garner around 7-8 stars to many of his works.",

Chow, who stars in the film himself, directs the film with a large awareness and cogency of its references. The movie is familiar because it's a satire, and it's a satire precisely because of its form and development.  Its sweeping scenes of all-too familiar battlegrounds and organized crime families recall to mind classic Hollywood tropes, only this time repackaged with the verve and panache of martial arts cinema. \n\nWhat is so interesting about \"Kung Fu Hustle\" is how it exploits the gentrified stupidity of classic cinema tropes. The effect of which is as loud as the memorable 'Lion's Roar' itself. The difference between a good satire and a great one is that while the former exposes the ironies and imbecile tendencies of the subject matter, the latter manages to make the said criticism enjoyable. The film unflinchingly distorts, thrashes, and laughs its way to acclaim and success; exerting great effort at taking jabs at the genre it falls in and reviving tired and cliched character arcs. To put it bluntly with Chow at the helm, \"Kung Fu Hustle\" manages to both honor and poke fun at slapstick martial arts to great effect.",

But I guess you can't go home again.  Technology has removed the wires that some stars (but not Jacky) formerly used to deliver flying kicks, replacing them with CGI miracles.  I never was a big fan of CGI.  However, I have to say that director and star Stephen Chow seems to have realised that the only way to use it is boldly, brashly, and in the most cartoonish way possible; in other words, what we have here is a Chuck Jones short populated by actual humans.  And that makes all the difference.  The plot is as zany as you would guess from that description.  Chow and his partner Tze Chung Lam pretend that they are part of the Axe Gang in order to try to squeeze money out of a poor community - however, they are quickly challenged by the real Axe Gang who, to their chagrin, discover that there are three aging kung fu masters retired in the town.  Or maybe there are four kung fu masters.  Or perhaps five.  Things do get out of hand (especially when the Axe Gang bring in some notorious ringers to combat them).  There are some well choreographed and over-the-top fight scenes (directed by Woo-Ping Yuen and Sammo Kam-Bo Hung, both immensely famous in their own rights) and some silly or slapstick comedy.  Things do get bloody as well (so this isn't for kids). Yet for all those things that Kung Fu Hustle gets right, I still felt a hankering for the old school.",

I remember the fight scenes, the running chase scene, the Axe Gang, the Lion's Roar, the Beast, and the piano scene. So when I watched this again, it still holds up greatly. Stephen Chow is really great, and he choreographs his fight scenes very well. The fight scenes are fantastic and just exhilarating to watch. The characters are memorable, especially the Beast who's in the last 30 minutes of the film. The references in this like Looney Tunes and other stuff are cleverly done and are very funny. The jokes are really good, and the effects still look amazing. The camerawork is impressive, and the soundtrack is really catchy. Kung Fu Hustle is a terrific movie that is a classic to me.",

In Shanghai during 1930s, Xing(acted by Stephen Chow) \nattempt to join in the Deadly Axe Gang with his friend Bone(acted by Zi Cong Lin). \nThey have trouble with the Deadly Axe Gang, and fights involved anti-physical \naction between gang and heroes run through the whole movie.\n \t\tThis movie, a reflection of Stephen's life, includes dream of being Bruce \nLee, fear of facing the reality and the enthusiasm of kungfu. The Buddha's Palm to \nChow ,a technique gained after overcoming all the setback, implies that he becomes \nstrong enough to protect himself, his parents and love. The BGM, action of kungfu \nand Wulitou way make it valuable to watch. Folk, western classical music, old \nshanghai music recreate the night life of shanghai. The most important element of \nStephen's movies , the Wulitou, is the promise of laugh which make you laugh \nwhenever you watch his movies. I have watched Stephen's movie since 2003 and \nKung Fu Hustle gives me a chance to watch my idol in the cinema.",

Weave a traditional love story with a gang movie, pair it with a musical, consummate it with mystical martial arts, carry it full term with comedy/slapstick, then deliver the love child that is Kung Fu Hustle. So many scenes are scene-stealing worthy. Any scene with the Land Lady is my favorite.\nMust see!\nPS...do not, I repeat, do NOT watch the English dubbed version (this applies to every movie ever made), treat yourself to a fine subtitled journey. I've watched both and the dubbed version loses almost all of the movie's charm.\nGive this film a whirl!",

The use of what at first seems like the bitter old landlady and her weak husband as the antihero's that help discover the \"chosen one\" is refreshing in its celebration of those older Kung Fu stars as the heroes of the film instead of only the good looking young action star.

But every single time watching this film, even only a portion of it, still brings me joy, pleasure, and emotions. That is how Kung Fu Hustle works, on three layers to be exact. The first layer of joy is for the ordinary viewer who has no idea about what is a Stephen Chow's film or what it is all about the Hong Kong cinema, since the film itself is a magnificent piece of over-the-top CGI that could jolt anyone, even my father who did not know this is a Chinese or HK film. Thanks to this layer (which the previous films of Chow often ignored) that Kung Fu Hustle was a huge success to the common audience, even the Americans who would be absolutely unable to understand the essence of the Chow's style of storytelling. The second layer of pleasure is dedicated to the avid fans of Hong Kong cinema and Chinese wuxia genre (literature and cinema in a whole) who will hundred percent go crazy about the tons of homage to the wuxia world, from the idiosyncratic characters of Jin Yong, to the crazy martial styles in the old Shaw Brothers films or the outdated TVB wuxia series, and of course the appearance of the kungfu legends of Hong Kong cinema who reinvented their roles in the most hilarious yet fully righteous way. The final layer, the emotional one, is reserved for the lifetime crazy fans of Stephen Chow, including myself, who can simply recall the Chow's identity from every single details of the film, who would cry their eyes out thinking about why Chow does not want to bring us HIS films any more, who still find joy in the new Journey to the West but somehow feel a deepen hole in their love to cinema thinking back about how excellent Chow was in the 1995 version. Suddenly I think about how similar Chow and Quentin Tarantino are, in term of originality, in term of their love to cinema, and in the amount of joy that they have brought to cinephiles around the world. Too bad that Quentin still makes films, good films that is, while Chow is simply nowhere to find...",

Of course, I instantly liked it.\n\nThe movie tells the story about Sing, a clumsy gangster wannabe and his pudgy sidekick trying to con their way through 1940s China.  Sing wants to join a ruthless mob called the Axe Gang, but he must first pass initiation by committing murder and mayhem.  Of course, his every attempt results in miserable failure.  He even manages to drag a small, peaceful village, known as the Pig Sty, into his misfortune and now the Axe Gang is out to destroy the village.\n\nSing wasn't always always a Bad Guy Wannabe.  In his youth he had tried to stand up for a little mute girl who was being boy-handled by a gang of bullies.  Sing ends up getting his own butt beat for all his effort, and has sworn off heroism ever since, because \"the bad guys always win.\"\n\nAh but Pig Sty Village harbours  its own secrets, for it is populated by a group of retired Kung-Fu masters who have sworn off violence and just want to be regular folks.  Still, when the Axe Gang comes calling, they must come out if retirement, and Sing must choose between living the gangster life or doing what he truly knows is right.\n\nLots of goofy special effects and farcical moments break up what could have been a disaster of an attempt to satisfy a cynical audience who has seen it all.  Some nods are given to old Chinese classics such as \"Enter the Dragon,\" as well as new American classics such as \"The Matrix.\"",

I found myself checking the clock, which I never do when watching movies. The craziness actually started getting boring. Perhaps if the movie had taken a step back after that first 30 minutes and allowed our brains a chance to revert to normal, I would have enjoyed it more. Maybe there are those who can handle the zaniess non-stop for that long. But it's not me. \nI'll give them credit for sure. The fight scenes are well choreographed and fun to watch. The humor is so left field, and off the wall, that you either love it, or hate it. I fall in the camp of loving it for awhile, then growing tired of it. \nI think it's still worth seeing.

This movie was like a live action anime. The characters, the writing, the fights, and all of the humor felt like right out of an anime and that's probably why I really liked this movie so much. Stephen Chow did an amazing job with this one. The story is well written. the characters are likeable and developed, and the action is fast paced, and the movie had a lot going on in it.

I must have missed 5 minutes of the movie coming in the theater (I don't like it when I miss the credits--both opening and ending), yet I felt like I missed nothing of universal importance. The first scene I saw was that of the Axe Gang chopping a running guy's leg and shooting a woman with a shotgun, in the back no less--such bad taste.\r\n\r\nI was entertained by this movie. I liked it! I enjoyed it. I enjoyed Stephen Chow's performance as the down-and-out hustler and would-be Axe gang member for the same reason I enjoyed Kim Jung-eun's performance as Vivian Kang in \"Lovers in Paris\"--their funny facial expressions!\r\n\r\nThe film also benefits from the wise use of special effects to advance the plot to its succeeding hilarious sequences. And that screaming woman! Wow! She and her husband are one of the film's highlights--watch it and you'll see what I mean. And also that effeminate kung fu master--ridiculous.\r\n\r\nYou'll have a lot of fun watching this movie, but if you're not as tightly wound up as I am, you're gonna die laughing! Enjoy!",
