The realisator is Mike Newell and the leads actors are : Daniel Radclife ( harry potter ) , Ruper grint ( Ron weasley) and Emma Watson ( Hermione Granger ) . It was released the 30 november 2005. It s the story of harry potter who gone to hogward for his 4th year and it s the year where there is the goblet of fire . He is too young to participate and he don t want to because it s really dangerous. But no one know why but harry potter was registered to participate. In my opinion the actors are very good  when we see the moovie we really think that we are at hogward because the acting is so good. When we see the film we feel that the actors really lives at hogward. The soundtrack is really good it s all my childhood . The costume look like they really exist , that the hogward's magic really exist , it's the costume's power and the cinematographie let us fell that we are really to hogward ,  it's magic. The theme is wizard , not everyone can like it because it is a very special theme that not everyone can like. But the positive point is that you can escape the real world to go to a magic one whereas it is hard  to stop dreaming after the moovie. In my opinion it's the best moovie you can see in your whole life if you like fantastic moovies. I really recommand pepole to see these movie.",

Probably. \n\nThere is a lot of subject material to get through in this movie (37 chapters compared to 17, 18 and 22 in the first three films respectively) and it shows. The film is incredibly fast paced and a little jumpy. While the Triwizard Tournament is exciting, the quiet moments with the core 3 are lacking.\n\nThat being said, this is still a Harry Potter movie, and I could watch these films on a loop. The story is full of misdirection, exhilarating stakes and one of the best finales in the franchise. I find myself bawling my eyes out during/after the graveyard every time. \n\nThis movie raises the stakes and brings the world of Harry Potter to the next level. I love Harry's response to Hermione's question, \"Everything's going to change now, isn't it?\" He, like the audience, knows that there is no turning back now.\n\nBest Character: Fred and George Weasley\nBest Scene: The Graveyard\nBest Quote: \"Dark and difficult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy.\" - Albus Dumbledore\nBest Piece of Score: Harry in Winter\n\nAdditional Note: I needed more Sirius. \nAdditional Note 2: Dumbledore is so frustrating in this movie. He is aggressive, brash and not the calming force that he is supposed to be. He finally calms down in the dormitory scene, but for the most part, I found myself missing Richard Harris.",

I am a huge sucker for tournaments in films and this hit every single note for me; intensity, stakes, creativity, it is all there.\n\nOur main cast is doing some of the best acting of the series, Daniel Radcliffe really raises his performance up a notch and establishes himself as the lead of the franchise. His acting is refined and mature and he does an excellent job portraying his emotions with not only his line delivery but his facial expressions and body language. He really broke through here and it was a joy to see. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were great, but they had a slight decrease in screentime and really were sidelined during this film. The introduction of Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory brings an interesting dynamic to the story, as Harry Potter has somewhat of an older brother figure to contend with. The relationship and chemistry between the two builds and brings some emotionally heavy scenes throughout.\n\nThere is constant action in this film; from the opening scenes of the Quidditch World Cup to the multiple rounds of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, there is always something happening, and it helps create a very steady pace throughout. Not only is there action, but there is also fantastic character development. All of our characters really start to come into their own through the struggles they all face throughout the film. Harry is the best he's ever been, and the new faces are great on screen. Alastor Moody is mysterious and quirky and is a great mentor to Harry.\n\nBut the greatest thing about this film is the sinster introduction of Lord Voldemort. His presence was lurking in the background of the entire series, but here he is reborn in a horrifying way. Ralph Feinnes is superb in his only 6 minutes of screen time, but it is enough to leave a lasting impression. The ending is perfect and sets the tone of the franchise going forward.\n\nWhile the cinematography and tone might be better in Prisoner of Azkaban, I cannot deny that this movie is better in almost every other aspect, which is why it gets a slight nod.\n\nScore: 89%\nVerdict: Excellent",

This year, the school is hosting the Triwizard Tournament, which is a dangerous and prestigious competition.  Two other visiting schools have champions to offer, but when Harry gets unexpectedly chosen as Hogwarts' unprecedented second champion, something must be amiss.  Now I have always regarded Goblet of Fire as my favorite book and least favorite movie.  I remember griping about how much the movie left out in comparison to the source material, and as I make my way back through this series, I tried to approach this movie with more of an open mind.  Well, years may have passed, but I still feel exactly the same way.  Now I'm not here to air grievances for these movies failing to include every plot point in the book.  On the contrary.  The third movie is probably my favorite of the entire series, and it leaves a lot of action on the pages, but it is all for the benefit of story flow.  I will even commend Goblet of Fire for cutting the entire house elf subplot, as you could only do that thread justice if you had a television format of storytelling.  What I will complain about is the choice to make cuts that come close to making this story not make narrative sense.  I'm not exaggerating much when I say that they get through the opening ten chapters of this story in about ten minutes.  It puts such a tight restraint on any potential flow this movie could build, and I don't feel like scenes in this are given any room to breathe.  The book takes its time to let situations unfold naturally, but this movie always feels like it is in a rush to get on to the next big moment.  Because of this, every character feels like they are trying to hastily progress the plot, and you stop buying that they are acting there in the moment.  It's almost as if the makers of this are reliant on the fact that you've read the book, so you are therefore willing to accept the shorthand this movie has to offer.  I am here to tell you that is poor filmmaking and storytelling.  Despite having many objections on how this got handled, this movie is not without its moments.  I think the scenes involving the dragons are pretty cool, and even though the CGI is a bit dated at this point, it is still put together in an exciting fashion.  I also think the teenage melodrama actually works more than it doesn't.  These are real fights that kids would have at this age, and the actors do a good job of selling it.  This movie feels like a bare minimum effort in comparison to the other films, and I think this book would work far better as a mini-series.",

The story is the best from every sector. considered perfect The start of the battle, adventure, action that has come into play due to the fact that in this sector Hogwarts has organized a Triwizard tournament. Tourmemt and other magic schools are also participating. Each school will send a representative to compete in this magic tournament. The age of the participants must be at least 17 years old, although Harry is not yet. Reached the criteria, but he accidentally entered the competition. This creates a lot of turmoil because the life expectancy line that Dumbledore, Head Professor of Horgwarts, has a dash. There's no way a child under 17 can deceive, causing the whole school to think that Harry lied that he wasn't doing it, and Harry's best friend Ron became jealous because he thought Harry wanted to be a hero. That's a really crazy idea for me. It frustrates me a lot with Ron's stupidity, but it's understandable because it's Ron Lol, and it leaves Harry out of nowhere. I'm so sad.  Ron is seriously bipolar in this regard.\n\tI liked this part because I saw the development of the relationship of the 3 friends, the different stages they had to prepare. It gave me a lot of excitement, such as the amazing battle between Harry and the dragon. He fights with excitement. And the scene where you have to open the underwater crystal ball in order to hear the hint to understand because it's a hint from the mermaids that make it on land to not understand. It was a scene that was truly unthinkable. seeing many wonderful things The creatures in the magical world that I had imagined while reading. The effect is done very well. Many characters appear in this installment a lot or even Harry has used what he learned to compete. It's amazing how he remembered what he had learned, Lol.\n\tThe movie puts more pressure on the viewers with the final mission that viewers like me watch and become uncomfortable instead. because everyone was led into the maze There aren't any demons here, but what we do find is the fear in our minds of going in the unknown and unfamiliar places. Suffocation and the scene clashing with the resurrected Lord Voldemort. He was really scary but he killed my Cedric which was way too easy. The effects of this movie never really disappoint. Every scene is great, amazing blend of magic, horror, humor and comedy and it's extremely entertaining and darker than the previous films.\n\tIt's not a perfect movie. A lot of things were rushed and skipping the good ones made me still prefer the book. but for the time 157 minutes watched I'm not disappointed at all It's a very good time. I will definitely continue to watch it every year, I believe that. I recommend.",

It progressed from scene to scene with a smoothness that i find to be lacking in many movies adapted from books. The acting has noticeably improved from the first three, and the more adult feel to this one really drew me in. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this movie was the fact that it felt like a mix of genres. This episode contains loads of adventures and action and it is such deeply riveting and emotional ; beside , still have bombastic special effects and several images have you on the edge of your seat , including an amazing array of technical bizarre creatures , a breathtaking combat between Harry and a dragon , a rescue from sea deep of his friends and an exciting battle between Harry and the Dark Lord and his henchmen , the Death Eaters. The picture displays stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown adventures , blending wizardry , witchcraft , horror , humor and being extremely amusing and enjoyable . Darkest even than previous chapters ; it is more thrilling ,more dramatic , more touching and more exciting. Finally, I would like to recommend this movie for everyone to try and see. Everyone can see the friendship of their friends or even the love and sacrifice of parents or people who love us. A fight against injustice that everyone believes must be overcome with Harry as their only hope. The courage of a boy who must fight evil. By inside, he is afraid,  but with courage and encouragement and support from those around you  It gave him the strength to fight that darkness.",

            "content": "I liked this film very much. It is much darker than the previous outings, but not as faithful to the source material. The only thing I didn't like so much about the book, was the subplot about Hermione trying to help house elves. It was cute, but interfered too much with the dark overtones of the narratives. The film looks dazzling, especially the ballroom scene. Speaking of that scene, I adored that dress that Hermione was wearing, Emma Watson looked unrecognisable in that scene.Also the music by Patrick Doyle this time was beautiful. I don't think it's as dark as the book, and I wasn't too keen on some of the casting. Roger Lloyd Pack and David Tennant were fine in their roles as the Crouches, but their characters were changed significantly. I did wish they made Crouch's disappearance more mysterious, instead of giving it away, ruining the suspense that was quite compelling up to that scene. I am not too keen on Michael Gambon's Dumbledore, I just don't remember Dumbledore being violent as they made him. As I've said already, I much prefer Richard Harris as the character. I am also on the fence about Mad Eye Moody. Brendan Gleeson is a very talented actor, evident in films like In Bruges and The General. He looked the part, but his voice wasn't exactly what I had in mind for Moody. I have listened to the audio tapes by Stephen Fry, and I imagine Moody's voice as low and gravelly. Although Gleeson mostly succeeded with his role, I personally think he tried too hard. My brother also noted that he didn't like the execution of the three tasks. I didn't like the third task, and the other two were fine. I did think on a positive note that Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort was suitably scary, and with the exception of Dumbledore everyone else was well done. All in all, a flawed but quite engrossing film, that doesn't quite live up to the darkness of the book. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

The characters are all still likable, the wizarding world itself is still just as imaginative as ever, and when the movie wants to go dark, it's brutal, eerie, and really memorable. \nI'm very conflicted!

Throw in the fact that the movie is also darker and murkier than the other entries, before and since, and the very mediocre performance by Robert Pattinson (already one of the most over-valued people in the industry).  The mystery element involving David Tennant's character, Harry Crouch Junior, is really the only thing of real interest beyond the end, but it never actually amounts to anything either, as the audience already knows that he's evil, and once he's found out, his story ends literally seconds later..

The plot is about the Triwizard tournament, where each school's representative battled for the glory. But somehow Potter was chosen as the fourth contestant, and we have ourselves a fun and intense story.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I wasn't bored through another two and a half hours of this franchise. This is the first one that kept my interest throughout. Again, there were more unique wizard stuff that further expanded the universe. This was always fun to watch, and this movie still kept that tradition going.\n\nThe first half actually was teen drama where the students went to a ball. The romance was more prominent, and even became naughty in some scenes.  What drove the plot was the tournament, and the looming danger that hid beneath it throughout the runtime.\n\nWhen the imminent doom hit at around the last round of the tournament, the movie became vastly more intense. For the first time, I felt that Harry's life was in actual danger. \n\nAs for problems, the runtime was still a tad bit long. Also, some of the rounds in the tournament were pretty weak an could have been more fun.\n\nOverall, this movie is where the main story actually starts. 9/10",

He makes the most out of the lengthy runtime here by excising a lot of the subplots in the novel in an extremely successful way as it allowed more time to be spent on the climactic finale than had been allotted in any of the previous 3 movies. There was more interaction between the characters and a highly appreciable increase in comedy. The actors had grown up quite a lot and were doing better in each iteration at showing their acting range, with Hermione a particular highlight in this one. Doyle acquitted himself remarkably well, with his film score on par with Williams's previous three and the CGI had improved drastically even with only a year's time passing. Best of all was the source material itself as the underdog sports genre is probably my #1 favorite and the finale here is probably the best in the entire series, both the graveyard part and the quasi-epilogue reveal. I think Cuaron misunderstood the intended audience for these as his priorities seemed rooted solely in quality filmmaking instead of entertaining a mostly-teenaged audience, a concept Newell is apparently an expert at. The only criticism I have is that I think they could've found a few minutes to devote to the Quidditch World Cup instead of skipping the entire thing as that was one of the best chapters in the book!",

            "content": "The non-so magical review from a muggle.\n\n Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a fantasy/adventure film directed by Mike Newell. It is based on J.K.Rowling's novel which was written in 2000 and carries the same name as the novel. It was released on November 23, 2005. It is as well the fourth part in the Harry Potter film series.\nLast Christmas, I saw this film and it was definitely one to remember. Just like past Harry Potter films this one didn't fail to amuse me. You could tell that this was filmed on a big-budget compared to the previous films of the series. To my mind I think this one offers a lot more than fantasy or adventure, it also gives you a lot of headspace to imagination. This piece of art surely left me astonished and filled with questions, wanting to watch the next part. \n\nAs for the plot of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, it includes the three main characters to be grown up, as they enter their fourth year of the School of Wizardry and Witchcraft: Hogwarts. It holds a fair amount of violence, since Harry Potter, the main character has to enter the prestigious Triwizard Tournament as a minor and face some dreadful challenges along the way of becoming a champion. Throughout the film, new characters came to light. Some added a romantic aspect to the film, whereas others did not. For the 14-year-old Harry Potter, he endures pressure a normal teenager cannot handle to confront his biggest nightmare. With the help of his dearest friends, Hermione and Ron, he doesn't fail to succeed in the period of the tournament. After all, this is the year students prepare for the Yule Ball and dare to ask female students as their date to the ball. Yet, the charming part of the film quickly ends there, as Harry Potter will live up to his title as \u2018The Boy Who Lived'. \nThe Harry Potter series is known to leave every person astounded who is into fiction and/or fantasy. As for me, it was always a surprising experience watching through these films, as you notice the characters growing up from a young child to an adult. There is no doubt that J.K. Rowling is by far one of the most influential writers in our century. Not only, did she write several successful books but stands as a role model for young children and women. With the apparent cliffhanger at the end of the first film, it will leave you wanting more and you will end up watching the next films that follows up on the previous one. \nPersonally, I am a lover of anything fictional, which is obvious why I am a fan of Harry Potter. Behind the success of these series, I suppose that watchers admire the films as they are not predicable as much as you think it would be. For instance, in this film, it gets quite dark quickly once you watch Harry get involved into life-or-death situations. Another example, is that Harry experiences tons of emotions in this film. As he goes through happy moments with his friends, he goes through the same amount of unknown moments and feelings. However, I must say that this is perhaps the most significant Harry Potter film so far. Mainly because, while I was watching this part of the series it felt like a mix of genres. Also, another example to why this film doesn't have a sole boring moment since it will keep introducing new characters throughout. For the Triwizard Tournament I mentioned earlier, there will be a ton of new, yet interesting characters added who bring a value to these films, which also was an enjoyable aspect. Lastly, this film was not excessively long but definitely long enough to tell the story. But there is one negative detail, that the films don't fully cover every single detail like the books do. So if you want to have a full understanding experience, I suggest you to also read the books so that you don't miss out on other details. \n\nClearly, this masterpiece will be a hard one to forget, as it will stick to you for a longer time. It is not something that you will be able to forget soon, as it so famous. I would recommend this film to anyone who might be interest in fantasy and fictional characters. Furthermore, it is important to watch them in chronological order, since every film leaves a cliffhanger at the end which follows up on the next one. Lastly, I hope you get lost into the imagination of the magical world of Harry Potter, just like I did.",

            "content": "Summary: \n\tThis movie marks an important cornerstone in the development of the Harry Potter universe with the return of the Dark Lord Voldemort. It is set in Hogwarts during the fourth year of school, when the Triwizard Tournament takes place. It is a traditionally a competition between the three prominent schools of magic including Hogwarts, Durmstrang and Beauxbatons. Prior to the competition, the Goblet of Fire selects three students from each school to participate in the contest. Harry is unexpectedly selected and forced to enter the competition by the Goblet of Fire with three other students even though he never put his in the cup and he is also underage. Later, it is found out that one of the Voldemort's underlings cast an advanced spell on the Goblet to deceive it of Harry's age. During the first three rounds of the contest, Harry and the other students have to complete many difficult tasks such as rescuing underwater and fighting dragons. The climax of this movie comes when the four students compete to get out of the maze, the last round of the contest. However, Voldemort, still in his feeble from between dead and alive, and his underlings are in there waiting for the four, eventually killing Cedric from Hogwarts. Harry, after that, is capture, and his blood extracted and used to rebuild Voldemort into a strong physical form. Harry then duels against the Dark Lord for his life. He barely escapes Voldemort and eventually brings Cedric's body back to campus with the knowledge that Voldemort has returned.\n\nAnalysis: \n\tThe important turn of events in this movie heralds major change development of the storyline and the journey of Harry Potter as the main hero in this series. Harry is now no longer inherently safe from Voldemort like before when Harry's blood was has the magic against the Dark Lord. Now, both share the same blood as he used his Voldemort used Harry's blood to revive himself. Harry no longer is protected and now susceptible. He is now more representative of real-life heroes, who actually have vulnerabilities, not inherently indestructible by enemies as Harry used to be earlier in the series. \n\tThis sharing of blood between Harry and Voldemort is also symbolistic of the struggles that real-life heroes have. It is like a connection across the dichotomy of good and evil, signaling the heroes also have their own evil side that they struggle against. \n\tFurthermore, when Harry's friend Ron turns against him, it further depicts Harry as a misunderstood hero. Ron estranged himself from Harry because Ron thinks that Harry intentionally enters himself into the contest for fame. However, later in the movie, Ron actually helps Harry to get through one of the dangerous rounds of the contest where the four students had to compete underwater. Ron's actions actually saved Harry's life. This part of the stories highlights the resilience of true friendship. No matter how significant the misunderstanding is, true friends will still help each other when in need and resolve the problem between them.\n\tThen when the four enter the last round of the tournament, the maze, Cedric encounters a minion of Voldemort, he is murdered by the killing curse. Then, Harry is captured by the other underlings of Voldemort. His arm is cut, and his blood collected to revive Voldemort. Harry has to duel against him for his life. He almost loses against the newly rejuvenated and strengthened Dark Lord. However, the souls of Harry's loved ones who were murdered by Voldemort appear from Voldemort's wand and give Harry's time to get to the Portkey to escape the maze. This scene demonstrates the theme of love's triumph over hate and evil. \n\nCritique: \n\tI love this movie and the whole Harry Potter series as a whole. There are, nonetheless, certain details that I think can be improved upon. The first one is rather a minor detail. It is when Dumbledore finds out the Goblet of Fire has chosen Harry as the fourth selectee to enter the tournament. The book says that Dumbledore \u2018calmly' asks Harry if he actually put his name into the Goblet. However, the corresponding scene in the movie portraits Dumbledore's asking as aggressive and intimidating when he grabs Harry's arms and shakes them while questioning him. This minor detail, although does not affect the structural integrity of the storyline, somehow momentarily breaks the usual portrayal of Dumbledore as a gathered and calm man without serving any significant purpose. \n\tThe second detail is when Harry is forced to enter the Tournament. J.K Rowling here could have better explained why it is that way, because the audience may have questions such as the following: Why is an underage forced to enter such a perilous contest even when he does not want to? Or Why can't/doesn't the administration do anything to keep Harry from the having to enter? Explanations to these questions can further strengthen the integral structure of the storyline. \n\tOverall, despite these small details that may be improved, I still give the movie 5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Year 4 sees Harry Potter return to Hogwarts and endure something never before done by a wizard of his age. The Triwizard tournament sees students from three different schools compete in a series of dangerous competitions in order to achieve eternal glory. When Harry's name appear from the the cup he must enter the tournament and compete in these dangerous events all while dealing with new aspects of his personal life.\n\nThis film sees the original cast return and all give great performances across the board. Danielle Radcliffe has one extremely good scene when he returns with Cedrics body, he really showed what he can do as an actor in that scene. We get a couple of key new additions in Cedric Diggory played by Robert Pattinson as well as Mad Eye Moody played by Brendan Gleason. But as we find out by the end of the film Mad Eye was actually Barty Crouch played by David Tennant. That really was extremely obvious, they do a really poor job hiding throughout the film and guessed it pretty early on. \n\nThe storytelling is extremely well done and wastes no time throughout the film, giving us an extremely fast paced film. It jumps right in with Harry and the gang heading to the quidditch World Cup, where death eaters appear and terrorize the event. Directly after that the film begins setting up the personal relationships between these characters and than it jumps right into the tournament. \n\nOur characters are entering a point in their life when puberty is beginning. This means that our characters begin to have feelings for one another while also dealing with some tension. This tension comes in the form of Ron, Ron is a jerk in this film and honestly just a really unlikeable character. I understand that these kids are going through a time in their lives when these situations can happen but Ron just completely changed. \n\nThe tone balance in this film was really off at times. They made this film a lot darker than the first three which makes sense considering that they are showing how dangerous this wizarding world can be, but that tone leaked into a lot of character scenes and just made it feel weird. Hermonie legitimately never looks happy and Ron is completely different. It made for some strange character scenes that didn't feel right.\n\nThe tournament was a lot of fun and shows us aspects of the wizarding world we hadn't seen before. Each trial is really fun and does a good job of showing the type of person Harry is. It shows how Harry is just this run of the mill kid that wants a normal life. It also shows how caring and heroic Harry is.\n\nFinally I have to talk about Voldemort played by Ralph Fiennes. This is are first real look at the dark lord and my oh my is he menacing. He is a good mix of psychotic and haunting as we see him toy with Harry but then become extremely intimidating right after. That entire sequence in the graveyard is great.\n\nOverall The Goblet of Fire is a great film. With a great cast, fun scenes and great storytelling, this film has a lot to enjoy. But in addition to that we get a really strange take on Ron's character as well as some weird tone balancing that make the film darker than it needed to be. \n\n8/10",

GoF is my favorite book in the series, and they just left so much out that its kinda tough to view this film from an unbias standpoint. Overall, the entire film is a downgrade from the previous. The lighting is more generic, as is the cinematography ... which leads to a less visually pleasing film. The introduction of the slight gray filter starts, and it always pisses me off when they suck the color out of such a vibrant world to try and convey a more grim tone when the narrative itself should support that. Alot of moments feel more mechanical and kinda ubrupt due to a lack of buildup and context. Harry seems alot more passive with Ron and Hermione, but then out of nowhere gets frustrated with them. Dumbledore isn't Dumbledore in this one, just a heads up. Sorry to get all negative, here are the positives! Voldemort's *ahem* was amazing and well done, as were all 3 trials! \n\nIt sounds like I hate this film ... but I dont, I just think its a step down from nearly every aspect of the last. Still pretty good, but disappointing.",

The Triwizard tournament games are thrilling, exciting, and suspenseful - the scenes in between the games are mostly fun and humorous. Goblet features the first of \"teenage drama\" between the main characters, and as a consequence we get limited time with our three heroes interacting/working together. Although they reunite by the end of the movie, you can't help but feel you missed something as the first three films focus closely on Harry, Ron, and Hermione together, and this one does not. Most of this movie is focused on the spectacle of the games, rather than moving the overarching good vs evil storyline forward. It makes up for this with an intense final 20 minutes featuring the biggest event in the series thus far- the return of Voldemort. Goblet of Fire feels like the last movie that maintains some sense of innocent fun, as the ending propels the story forward into the confrontation with Voldemort.",

Nine reels is a lot to put together and screening a three hour movie can be exhausting, especially when you're trying to write several term papers during the same week it is coming out. You see, I am a projectionist and getting this movie ready for a midnight show was part of my job. I realize that the fact that I was paid $14.50/hr to watch this movie on Wednesday night might give rise to feelings of jealousy among some, but I am currently wishing I could manage to get more than five hours of sleep sometime soon.\n\nAll that said I must say this was by far the greatest Harry Potter film so far. Although it was long, it did not drag on. It had a nice, tight feel to it. It progressed from scene to scene with a smoothness that I find to be lacking in many movies adapted from books. The acting has noticeably improved from the first three, and the more adult feel to this one really drew me in. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this movie was the fact that it felt like a mix of genres. It had an epic feel to it. After all it is about good v. evil and battling the dark wizards, etc. This movie,however, also felt like a high school movie. It had the issues of coming of age, which makes sense as the characters begin to mature. Ultimately it came off a lot more loyal to the book in theme than I think the last one did. (The first two, while loyal, I found to be relatively campy and childish.)\n\nThis movie, like many, does have its shortfalls. I believe that Dumbledore was portrayed as a little too intense, like an old Al Pacino. Instead of the benevolent, kind, and good-humored old man I have always loved in the books. As someone that has read the books, I must say another shortfall is that this movie banks on familiarity with the story. Having read the books, I found it very easy to follow, but I could understand how one who has not read the books may feel a bit lost, as some important information was left out and some back-story was left mostly unexplained.\n\nAll in all I would say this is definitely the best movie in this series so far, and if the next three are on par with this one then I would be content.",

            "content": "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, directed by Mike Newell, is one of the most entertaining installments of the saga, but had a tough time finding it's place. Right off the bat, I didn't like the idea of him directing this film because, he was too lazy to watch the other Harry Potter films, or to even read The Goblet of Fire. Mike Newell brings his own style to the film, which is completely fine, but his execution fell short, feeling like he was working against the former directors, instead of working with them.\n\nMike Newell finds a way to incorporate a few decent ideas, with a handful of entertaining sequences, and great stakes, but the film as a whole, feels unconnected, with a lot of unnecessary filler, and subplots, that doesn't offer a whole lot to the film or saga, and could've easily been cut to develop more important events. On more than a few occasions, Newell started to craft a decent idea, and then he'll bail on it, and it became quite annoying. The pacing moves pretty fast through everything, leaving some things underdeveloped, and not that interesting, at times. The tones of the film play along the same lines as Prisoner of Azkaban, but turning up the darkness and comedy a level or two. The tones were fine for the most part, but Newell wanted this to be more of a comedy than all the others, and it feels forceful at times.\n\nAlthough this is still a story-based narrative, the characters had a lot to do. There was some nice moments from our returning supportive characters, while there was great tention from our three returning leads. There was a lot of nice maturing aspects to our leads, but it throws off the focus of the film, making it feel like two different films at times. Although there were some decent character moments with our returning characters, the abundance of new additions were almost completely disposable! There were a select few that belong in the narrative, but eighty percent of them have about two lines of dialogue, being utterly underutilized.\n\nThe screenplay by Steve Kloves had a lot of standout moments! He incorporated a lot of mature themes and messages, beautifully delivered by the cast! The issues with the screenplay, is the inconsistencies, and imbalances, due to an overstuffed narrative.\n\nThe production of this film looks great! The creative team used a lot of beautifully detailed set pieces, to really make the scenes pop! The cinematography looks fantastic, utilizing a lot of blues and greens, to really set the tone.\n\nThe Goblet of Fire really brings the magic element to new heights! With there being so many memorable action and magic sequences, the creative team still managed to balance it well, so it doesn't over saturate the message and themes they were going for. The effects also look phenomenal, still holding up til this day! It's a pleasure to be able to witness the big steps they take with each film, and seeing them come into their own.\n\nOverall, if I had a favorites list, Goblet of Fire is definitely in my top 3, but due to a lot inconsistencies, it's hard not to keep this one out of the bottom three.",

            "content": "I like to call this film, Harry Potter and the Runaway Barber because it's distracting how shaggy everyone's hair is, but this film is still a good continuation of the series. This a solid script that was adapted from one of the longest books in the series, Steve Kloves seems to have really put some thought into it because it made take a one movie break. As many people have pointed out, this series and the characters are all growing, learning, and maturing as they rediscover themselves and this film handles the awkwardness of teenagers pretty well and finds ways to relate this magical world to real-life which I found to be thoughtful filmmaking. Robert Pattinson makes his big-screen debut with a performance that shows he has potential, it's just a shame it was wasted on Twilight. Brendan Gleeson was very good as the ever-eccentric Moody, he gave some good comedy relief and had a such a character twist there at the end. The tri-wizard tournament itself was very intense and felt like it had consequences, it affects our hero and causes him to grow up real fast. The graveyard duel is awesome, it is very dark but that's what this film needed, Voldemort return is very menacing and he is shown as a major threat from the very beginning which sets the stakes really high and a great actor like Ralph Fiennes just elevates that to a level of great villainy that his reputation from the last films foretells. It is painfully clear to me that both Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are both better actors than Daniel Radcliffe, I just didn't get emotionally invested with his performance like it wanted me to. There are a few too many exposition dumps and Radcliffe's performance was a little shotty to me sometimes, John Williams score is sorely missed, this film also needed to be about 10-15 minutes longer than it is because it feels like there are a few chunks of the story missing, they needed to include other characters such as Ludo Bagman. Despite the issues, I actually enjoyed re-watching this film more than I thought I would, it is entertaining enough, most of the performances were great, the character building was well done once again, and the ending is very dark and ominous, it eludes to a future with Voldemort ruling in terror and it is a set up for the direction that the last half of movies go. This is about as good as Chamber of Secrets for me and I can't wait to re-watch it again someday soon.",

Additionally irrelevant plot details were given undue attention, whereas those perhaps most important were rewritten or just omitted due to having directed all of the attention in the wrong areas. Of course it would have helped a great deal if Newell had actually read the book with any degree of care and attention, as he admitted he had not prior to starting production, but in particular Dumbledore's character assassination is one thing that I, along with millions of other HP fans, will never forgive director Newell. When you adapt written word to the screen, big or small, you MUST pay due respect to that source material, otherwise you are simply displaying apathy towards the fans, and essentially presenting the notion that you think that you're above the author in some way, and that is the big mistake director Mike Newell made in this film. It isn't all doom and gloom though, performances al around (even from Gambon) were very strong, Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter is absolutely sensational, and Brendan Gleeson as Moody was another perfect cast. The narrative is far too episodic comparative to the fluidity of the previous three films, however as stated earlier the visual effects, the dragon in particular, were utterly fabulous. From an objective point of view, this is a good film, however in consideration of how much it strayed from the source material, and as a fan of said books, it falls flat in comparison with most of the other entries in the series.",

We are introduced to many new things in this movie like the quidditch world cup, a cool tournament, and Voldemort. Yet this film focuses too much on flash instead of substance.\n\nThere are some undeniably cool scenes, but they make no sense once revisited upon second thought. How are the death eaters able to attack a WORLD tournament so easily, especially when EVERYONE is armed with a potentially lethal weapon? How come we haven't been introduced to other schools before and how come we never hear from them again? Also, why TF should anyone care about Cedric? He has never been introduced to the series before.\n\nI appreciate that this film is the first of the series to receive a PG-13 rating and has darker themes than previous movies. Yet, the love stops there. It felt more like a self-service for fanboys/girls and nothing more. This film by itself cannot be a good standalone movie.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the awkward \"love\" scenes that this film tries to incorporate in it. Felt forced and was bleugh.\n\n1.5/5.

            "content": "A relatable teen journey surrounded by darkness.\n\nMike Newell's coming of age dark fantasy feature Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) is a startling sober and bleak picture about Harry finally having to mature. Newell's direction is neat with many creative visual choices for the dark action, but he also leans in too much into teen romance-comedy tropes too much during the ballroom dance sequence as well as the love triangles. Goblet of Fire feels a bit long, clocking in at 157 minutes, with steady pacing from editor Mick Audsley. All the teen romance drama bits slow down this picture a great deal as it all seems paltry compared to the looming threat of violence. Goblet of Fire is exciting and endearing, so I can forgive its faults.\n\nJ. K. Rowling's writing is excellent for how she weaves a wizard tournament around the impending arrival of Harry Potter's main villain, played by a scene stealing Ralph Fiennes. He nails the creepy malice and sudden violent potential of Lord Voldemort. \n\nRoger Pratt's cinematography is beautiful during the water segments, horror bits, as well as all the teen drama, but his wide shots during dragon fight is awkward and misses the action. I wish shaky camera shots would go away as they ruin some moments early on, but many wide shots are striking the first port key teleportation or the dance. \n\nPatrick Doyle composes a fine, but forgettable score that doesn't compare to John Williams iconic Harry Potter music. Jany Temime and David Crossman's costumes are beautiful and playful, especially for the French witches arriving at Hogwarts.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe is excellent as a torn Harry Potter between the girls he likes and winning a contest he never entered. Rupert Grint is obnoxious as Ron Weasley in Goblet of Fire as his jealousy of Harry feels vaguely out of character and only could be the result of Rowling wanting his character to age into an angsty teenager. Emma Watson is devastating as a hurt Hermione Granger with her sort of toxic crush on Ron. Her dramatic acting during the ball is excellent and it's nice to see her so encouraging of Harry throughout this whole film.\n\nMichael Gambon plays Albus Dumbledore so strangely in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. His shouting at Harry once he realizes Harry's name was put into the Goblet of Fire feels very out of character. He doesn't feel as warm or kind as Richard Harris' Dumbledore at all. I like many of his unique choices, but not so much this time around. \n\nAlan Rickman is funny and cool as Snape, but still gets little to do. Robbie Coltrane is very funny flirting with Frances de la Tour. Brendan Gleeson is outright amazing as Mad Eye Moody. He transforms his whole appearance, with help from Eithn\u00e9 Fennel and Belinda Hodson's make-up, into a fearsome and fun character. His walking changes to limping as he puts a sneer on his face and is very expressive with what he's given. Gary Oldman gets a cameo as Sirius Black and that's about it. Robert Pattison is excellent as the kind and brave Cedric Diggory. Jeff Rawle delivers an amazing display of grief at the end of Goblet of Fire that you just have to see!\n\nCl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy is stunning as the graceful and poise Fleur Delacour. Stanislav Yanevski is forgettable as Victor Krum. Miranda Richardson is very funny and memorable as the annoying tabloid witch Rita Skeeter.\n\nMaggie Smith is really fun to watch as Minerva McGonagall as usual. Geraldine Sommerville is nice to see again as Lily Potter alongside Adrian Rawlins' James Potter. Tom Felton gets next to nothing to do as Draco Malfoy this time, whereas Jason Isaacs is excellent again as the arrogant Lucius Malfoy. Timothy Spall is fantastic as Wormtail. David Tennant is excellent and memorable as Barty Crouch Junior. James and Oliver Phelps are hilarious as Fred and George Weasley.\n\nI loved seeing Bonnie Wright again as Ginny Weasley because she's so cute and sweet. I wish she got more screen time with Daniel Radcliffe to build their relationship together as Ginny and Harry, but I digress. I like Katie Leung as Cho Chang, but I fail to see the point of having Cho be the love interest when they could have used Goblet of Fire as the first film to really develop Ginny and Harry's relationship naturally.\n\nIn all, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an excellent coming of age movie for teenagers and a thrilling dark fantasy picture for entire families to enjoy.",

I know everyone's main issue with this film is that the infamous Dumbledore line \"did u put your name in the goblet\"? Was shouted at Harry while in the book it was meant to be said calmly. As coming from my favourite book, that moment was a bit wired to see, but the more I watch this film, the more that scene doesn't bother me. I love the whole tri-wizard tournament, definitely the best parts of the film by a mile.... but what lets it down for me is the acting from Emma Watson, it seems abit off and when comparing to the other films, this is probably her weakest performance overall.

The things I didn't like however are things I really didn't like. The ball scene I thought was pointless, Ron acted like a massive baby almost the whole movie, and it felt like they where trying to hit at so many possible relationships to be explored in later films most notably Harry and Hermione and Harry and Cho but neither of those two things happened. Overall this is still enjoyable but definitely is the worst of the series for sure.",

            "content": "Strengths: Prisoner of Azkaban was darker than the first two installments, but it was here that the series moved into a more adult style, which was for the better. As the three leads moved into adolescence, they get a lot more to work with and all three actors deliver. Visually, I love everything about this film. It looks fantastic, while also maintaining the dark tone it needs. The Triwizard Tournament makes for a great concept to adapt to film. All three challenges allow for great scenes filled with tension. Harry's battle with the dragon is exhilarating, while the underwater scenes look great and are filled with danger. The Yule Ball also gave us a lighthearted time out, with some quality character moments. Robert Pattinson (Cedric) was better here than all the Twilight films. You really felt for his death. Speaking of, that was one of the most well done scenes in the franchise. It was so sudden, yet still sad. It had the desired effect. The return of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) was also a great scene. It really signaled the tonal shift in the movies and set the stage for a thrilling final four films. Throw in good stuff  from Michael Gambon (Dumbledore), David Tennant (Barty Crouch Jr.), and the visitors from the other schools, and you've got a slew of great performances.\n\nWeaknesses: I honestly can't find many flaws with this film. I wasn't a big fan of adding a tick for Crouch Jr.'s character. I know why it was done, but it took away from the big reveal near the end. As a reader of the book, there could've been more done with Rita Skeeter. She was more prominent in the books and if she wasn't going to play a similar role in the movie, they probably should've just cut her character as a whole.  \n\nOverall: It's the best Harry Potter film. I raved about it already, yet I still left a bunch out. It's faithful enough to the book to satisfy those fans, while also delivering a great movie if you're unfamiliar with the series. The grown up performances by the leads, the fantastic special effects, and the scenes involving the Triwizard Tournament and Voldemort were all tremendous. Stellar.",

            "content": "First, a confession: I am not, by any stretch of the imagination, a Potter fan, so I felt something of a fraud as I sneaked into a media screening of Goblet of Fire while many bona fide devotees have had to wait it out.\n\nMy interest in the franchise has thus far consisted of sitting through the first film in a freezing cinema wondering what all the fuss was about, and skim-reading the second book on an aeroplane to appease my curiosity as to the young wizard's appeal. I have long been astonished at the sheer scale of Rowling's achievement, and while I may treat many of my fellow commuters - the regressive thirty-somethings who are buried in her CHILDREN'S novels on the tube - with something approaching contempt, I realise her success is very much deserved. It's a bit excessive though, and frankly enough to reduce any impoverished wannabe writer to a jealous whimper.\n\nBeing an outsider who will undoubtedly get all the names wrong, I won't spend long here on the plot, save to say it revolves around the \"tri-wizard tournament\" - an epic and dangerous event that threatens to split Hogwarts loyalties asunder.\n\nInstead, I'll concentrate on the performances, and, first up, I fear I must say I have reservations over the casting of Harry. Daniel Radcliffe looked an inspired choice after the first film - floppy hair and specs and an earnest charm - but I'm afraid to say, he is an ordinary actor. The trouble with hiring an eleven year old for a film project as massive as this, is you are rather in the lap of the gods when it comes to puberty. It's a bit like doting on a baby puppy and then being terribly upset a year or so later when a bloody great Alsatian smashes up your living room and defecates on your carpet.\n\nMuch better are his faithful chums. Rubber-faced Ron (Rupert Grint) handles the adolescent grunting with considerably more aplomb than Radcliffe, and he also says \"bloody hell\" a lot which elicited gasps of delight from some of the younger viewers around me. There is some nice chemistry between him and the hitherto gawky and posh Hermione who has blossomed into a snooty English rose, and the theme of teenage angst runs deep throughout the excellent supporting cast.\n\n\"Dark and difficult times lie ahead\" is the smartly worded tagline, and one gets the impression Harry is far more comfortable dodging fire-breathing dragons, than he is tiptoeing around the opposite sex. The growing pains are neatly handled by director Mike Newell, himself no stranger to the awkward whimsy of love's young dream after sterling work on Four Weddings and a Funeral - Indeed, many of the light-hearted interludes around the school dance scenes betray Newell's penchant for bittersweet comedy and romantic pratfalls.\n\nAnd, of course, the adults in the cast zoom around with a zest inspired by their youthful co-stars. Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid fashions an unlikely romance with a giantess played by Frances De La Tour; Michael Gambon is a sprightly Dumbledore; and Gary Oldman's screen time is restricted to one scene where he thrusts his head through the burning coals of a roaring fire to offer Harry some sage advice. Perhaps they should have simply hired a stunt double and saved on his fee.\n\nMost impressive of all is Ralph Fiennes who is genuinely terrifying as the evil Lord Voldemort. Fiennes is ably assisted in his wickedness by a suitably conniving Timothy Spall and also the most fearsome set of nostrils to grace the silver screen since Hannibal Lector flexed his snout at Agent Starling in The Silence of the Lambs.\n\nIt is pretty stirring stuff - visually extraordinary in places - and nicely paced. Potterfiles will love it and detractors may just find their criticisms stuck in their throats. However, my disdain for adults who proudly devour the novels on public transport without any sense of shame remains absolute.Based on one of the best books of the Harry Potter series, the film adaptation of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet' had a lot to live up to and I think it succeeded. As Potter fans will know, in GoF, Harry is now fourteen and in his Fourth Year at Hogwarts. When an ancient tournament between Hogwarts and two other European wizarding schools is held that year, a Seventh Year contestant is chosen from each school to compete but things go dramatically awry when Harry, three years too young to even be entered in the dangerous and challenging tournament, is somehow also chosen after his name is mysteriously nominated. GoF is a sharp turning point in the books as the tone darkens considerably and the characters themselves change from being rather wide-eyed innocent children to adolescents thrust the turbulent, uncertain adult world where being 'good' or even an innocent will not guarantee your survival. This shift is also reflected in the film, which was rated 12A (PG13 for Americans), the first of the HP films to be rated so high.\n\nI have to say I did enjoy this film, although Prisoner of Azkaban remains my favourite of the four. Unlike the first two films, this did not attempt to condescend as much to small children in the audience. The tasks of the Triwizard tournament captured most of the thrills of the book, particularly the second water-based task where the merpeople were suitably creepy (now we know why none of the kids go swimming in the summer term!), but the first task over-ran for a minute or two more than needed. Light romance was touched upon yet wasn't over-emphasised and the Yule Ball will please those who enjoyed the scenes in the book but audience members over the age of sixteen might find teens ogling each other a tad dull (Hermione is very out-of-character and the scene does drag).\n\nThe acting of the adult cast is, of course, exemplary as always. Alan Rickman's Snape may only have had four or so scenes but he definitely made his presences known while Maggie Smith really captured the essence of McGonagall. Many people do miss Richard Harris' Dumbledore but I found that Michael Gambon has done an excellent job of moulding the role to make it his own. In GoF, Dumbledore feels very human in the way he carries the weight of the wizarding world on his shoulders and though he struggles at times, his concern for his pupils is paramount. I finally felt the close rapport between Dumbledore and Harry in this film that was missing in the previous three HP flicks. However, the prize has to go to Brendan Gleeson for his scene-stealing depiction of Mad-Eye Moody. Gleeson clearly enjoyed illustrating Moody's dangerous, feral edge.\n\nThe younger cast have also grown into their roles, improving from their previous outing. Rupert Grint, usually used to playing a comical and stupid Ron, had the chance to cut his acting teeth and show Ron's darker, bitter side and he did well. The Phelp twins have also improved dramatically. No longer do they come across as wooden cut-outs just reading from a cue-card and instead they are able to show the mischievous spontaneity of the Weasley twins. And I look forward to seeing more of Matthew Lewis, who was great at showing Neville's sensitive side without making him too klutzy. Out of the younger cast, though, Dan Radcliffe is the one who has progressed the most. In PoA, he was awful in the 'he was their friend' scene so he seems like another boy in the harrowing graveyard scene and the aftermath, depicting Harry's anger, feelings of vulnerability and grief. He still stumbled on occasion in other scenes but I, at last, have faith he might be able to do the Harry of 'Order of the Phoenix' justice when the time comes.\n\nThe film did lose points on a few issues. Although most of the young cast have expanded their acting skills as they have gone on, Emma Watson is waning. She has a tendency of over-enunciating her lines and being too melodramatic, which worked in 'The Philosopher's Stone' when Hermione was condescending and childishly bossy, but is just annoying by this point. She spent most of the film sounding as if she was on the verge of tears or in a hormonal snit, even in scenes which were not remotely sad or upsetting. There was also a choppy feel to the film, as if Steve Kloves struggled to properly condense the book into a two-hour film. Those who haven't read the books will have missed quite a bit and those who have read the books will feel the film is very rushed. Molly Weasley and the Dursleys were also missed, especially since I think Julie Walters would have been exceptional in the Molly/Harry interactions that take place aftermath of the graveyard scenes of the novel as the film didn't round off in a manner that reflected a boy had died and Harry would be traumatised by what he saw.\n\nI think most Potter fans will enjoy this although they will remark that it could have been better. Non-fans will also get something from this film as I imagine it is hard not to be captivated by the many action and dramatic events but they may find themselves muddled by the story. I would recommend that parents of young children either keep away or, at the very least, check out the film firstly before deciding if their child is old enough to cope with it. When I went to see it, there was a small lad of four or five being dragged along and in the middle of a particularly fearsome incident, the silence of the moment was cut by a wee voice crying, 'Mummy, I'm scared' so, parents, be warned.Before I review the film, let me start off by saying that I am a fan of the Harry Potter films and have liked all of them up to this point. I'm not going to compare the movie to the book because, as most people know, they are two completely different animals. There is no way in heaven, hell or on God's green Earth that a book the size of Goblet of Fire could appropriate EVERYTHING that happened in the novel. I'm going to go by what I saw up on the screen.\n\nWhat I saw up on the screen was a completely pedestrian effort that made no attempt at contributing style, substance, or character development to a series that was getting better and better with each progressive film. Scenes start and stop with no explanation. The big action scenes (especially the fight with the dragon) just begin with no buildup whatsoever almost as if you've stumbled upon someone playing the new Harry Potter video game. There is no sense of the passage of time at all. The Tri-Wizard tournament consists of only three challenges yet the competition seems to last the entire school year. Ron and Hermione have a blow-up at the Yule Ball because of his misplaced jealousy yet six months go by (the last day of school) and NOTHING MORE is ever said about it? She even tells him that he made a mistake by not asking her out and he lets SIX MORE MONTHS go by without saying a word?!\n\nI can forgive the fact that a lot of these things are just glossed over because of the time crunch but I can not forgive situation after situation that has something happen only because the lead character needs to live. In the aforementioned fight with the dragon, Harry ends up hanging from a ledge 100 stories above the ground trying to reach his broom which is nearby. The dragon lands on the building and begins crawling down to him, slipping and sliding, peeling away shingles as it goes and it suddenly hit me. Harry is hanging from a ledge, defenseless, and the dragon is CRAWLING toward him. He is dealing with a creature who spits fire and who can FLY. One flap of its wings and a quick belch and Harry is crispy. The ONLY reason it doesn't is because Harry has to live. \n\nAnd for that matter, no one in the film acts or reacts to a situation because it's in their nature to do so. They react in a certain way because that's what the script demands that they do, even if it completely goes against their character and everything that we know about them. When Hermione blows up at Ron, it seems to come out of nowhere. She seems to be mad because Ron didn't ask her and she wanted to go with him. But if this is true, why is she so happy about being there with a competitor from a rival school? And I don't just mean happy, I mean she is absolutely BEAMING when she arrives with him. And at one point, Dumbledore grabs Harry and shakes him violently demanding that he answer a question. My reaction to that was WTF??? Has Dumbledore ever shown that he's a violent person or that he would grab a STUDENT, yelling in his face? Of course not but he does it because the script says he has to. At one point in the film, a particular curse is brought up that allows you to control another being. That's kind of funny because it seems like every character in this film is being controlled by the screenplay, even if it means going completely against character.\n\nBut I guess the biggest disappointment for me was the confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. For someone who has been built up to be the devil, he sure is beaten easily at the end of this film (and by a quartet of ghosts, no less, which took cheesiness to a new level). The appearance of Voldemort is obviously supposed to be chilling but, in actuality, he looks like a hairless rat wearing a cape. The great Ralph Fiennes does everything he can but part of the appeal of this character is NOT seeing him in closeup in full daylight. He shows up when he wants and manages to let Harry live because he'd rather talk him to death instead of just cutting off his head while Harry is pinned down. But, of course, that's because Harry has to live and this final confrontation, again, seems ridiculous in retrospect.\n\nThe entire Tri-Wizard tournament seemed a little off-kilter to me. You perform tasks that test your abilities and try to do better than your opponents, but to what end? The final test consists of entering an ever-changing maze and the first competitor to find the trophy wins the tournament. So, even if you finish DEAD LAST in every other challenge, if you're the first to find the trophy, you win anyway. So, I ask you, WHAT'S THE FRIGGIN' POINT OF EVEN COMPETING IN THE OTHER CHALLENGES?????? Why put yourself in harm's way three times when you only HAVE to do it once? \n\nLooking back, I just realized that you could completely skip this film and move right on to number five without missing a beat as long as you had someone to tell you two things about the film - Harry's interest in Cho and Voldemort being back, sort of. Here's hoping Order of the Phoenix doesn't follow the same path.",

            "content": "The turn in the franchise that finally pushes the Harry Potter movies forward, filled with much more darkness, a little more comedy, and a lot more tragedy. \n\nHarry is introduced to yet another Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher: the grizzled Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), a former dark wizard catcher who agreed to take on the infamous \"DADA\" professorship as a personal favor to Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). Of course, Harry's wishes for an uneventful school year are almost immediately shattered when he is unexpectedly chosen, along with fellow student Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson), as Hogwarts' representative in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, which awards whoever completes three magical tasks the most skillfully with a thousand-galleon purse and the admiration of the international wizard community.\n\nWithout question, I think this film is the best film in the franchise up to this date. It's easily the darkest, it has the most magic we've ever seen till now, it has deeper character development, it has a little more comedy, and it's just even more crazy. Without a doubt, it's one of my personal favorites in the entire series, which is saying a lot considering how good all the movies have been till this point. \n\nOne of the best things about this film is just how dark and emotional it is. This is the first PG-13 film in the franchise, and they really take advantage of that. This feels like the film that finally immerses you into the lore of Voldemort. From the very first scene, they establish the tone of what this film is going to be. It's much darker and more serious, showing us that the stakes are a lot more higher than we could ever imagine. The film is also simultaneously emotional, with a very impactful ending. It was a tragic ending and a perfect way to end this film. It ends on a question mark and a darker note, making us excited for what's next. \n\nI think that this film easily looks the best of the first four films. Granted, I feel like that's an obvious, but this easily is the most least dated movie till this point. Did that make sense? Probably not, but you get what I mean. The CGI and the sets look amazing in this film. The monotone and color pallet used suggests a much more darker and grim film. The camera work and the elaborate angles help tell a story through its visuals, which makes it even more impactful. I think this film looks amazing and it definitely deserves praise in that department. \n\nWith our main protagonists, I think this is also the point where you not only see them transition as older kids, but their acting also evolves a lot in this film. You can see their acting skills and how they've grown throughout the year. They're kids, but they act like they're older. Our characters also go through the same problems that a kid would at their age. They have problems expressing their feelings for one another, they struggle with their self image, they struggle finding dates to the ball, and so forth. It makes them even more relatable, and it makes us love our characters and cherish their relationships just as much. \n\nIn the end, this has been the most exciting film so far, while also being the dark turning point that makes this franchise what it is. I thought this film was fantastic, and a near perfect film.",

Watching Harry tackle the different obstacles and challenges that await him in the tournament has the audience at the edge of their seat. The CGI has come a long way since the sorcerers stone. The dragon sequence alone is breathtaking in how gorgeous it looks. The story telling is astounding, but falls just a bit shorter than The Prisoner of Azkaban. That is no knock against the film at all, as I saw that as a near masterpiece. I highly recommend this to any Harry Potter fan, and any fantasy fan alike.",

As such, this is without doubt the perfect time to have our cast at this greater age as they're far more able to fill the shoes a more in-depth adventure requires.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: It has to be said that on an aesthetic and spectacle level, it's far less pleasing than Michael Seresin and Alfonso Cuaron's efforts.\nVERDICT: Finally a properly exciting, engaging and adventurous journey for these great characters.

The actors have really come into their own, and seem very comfortable with their roles. Radcliffe takes on the part of an angsty teen with realism and believability, showing us that, despite being a much-admired wizard, he has no magic to fight off the horrors of puberty. Burgeoning adolescence is an underlying theme here, and it's explored so effectively and with such heart that I actually found myself feeling deeply for the characters, particularly in regards to the romance between Ron and Hermione, which contains undoubtedly the most moving scene. The effects are still spectacular, the action scenes are tense and engaging, and while the supporting characters don't have a lot to do, the focus is maintained where it needs to be. It might go on a bit long, and the climax is somewhat disappointing, but it brings a greater depth and seriousness, while managing to be funnier than even.

But Goblet of Fire is the turning point in the franchise for me.  Yes, Prisoner of Azkaban has its dark moments, but the grave sense of danger and threat isn't really present until the 4th film.\n\nThe Goblet of Fire opens with a pretty terrifying dream sequence involving a deformed Voldemort, which may very well be my favorite opening to any of the films in the series.  It comes right out and states that this franchise is no longer just a fun adventure, there are dangerously high stakes involved here, and Voldemort is a part of them.  Of course, part of the fun nature of this film is its mysteriousness and the unpredictability.  I've seen the film several times, but there's nothing quite like watching the Triwizard Tournament with someone who has no idea what they're in for.\n\nGoblet certainly brings some new characters along with its different identity.  Most notably, Brendan Gleeson's Professor Alastor 'Mad\u00acEye' Moody.  Looking back, it's difficult to assess how much I enjoyed the character considering he was kidnapped for nearly the entire length of the film, but his impact on Harry's tribulations throughout the film are felt.  I mean, why wouldn't he be an interesting character?  He's just the 4th straight new defense against the dark arts teacher to be hiding something in one way or another.\n\nNo matter, The Goblet of Fire is full of fresh adventures for the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  Most of the film involves Harry competing in the various events of the tournament (which ends up feeling a whole lot like a Hunger Games), but there's always time for some quality trio scenes.  Weirdly enough, this film made those scenes mostly deal with romance at the Yule Ball involving the three schools.  It's admittedly the next logical step in these teenagers lives, but sometimes it can be a bit overboard.  Some of it plays for comedy, but did I really need to see EVERYONE at Hogwarts, and I mean everyone, share the dance floor or have a scene with a love interet.\n\nIn many ways, The Goblet of Fire is the turning point in the franchise, and the first time you see someone of importance get hurt in a grave way.  Although you don't have a ton of time for Cedric to develop, his death altered the course of the series and the mindsets of those at Hogwarts.  That in itself makes it an important installment in the series.  Not to mention the fact that there's a dragon, a bada** maze, and one unsettling resurrection towards the end.  This is one of the better films, by a good margin.\n\n+Moody's introduction\n\n+Voldemort officially returns\n\n+More mature and powerfully written than previous entries\n\n+Turning point in the franchise\n\n-Too much romance\n\n9.2/10",

When the film came to a close on that incredibly up beat ending I wanted to find Newell and explain to him why the ending is so important. However, all those problems I have are taken back by the shear perfect directing. The style in this film is such a good balance between fun and dark that it creates its own. The story took Rowling 600 pages to explain, yet the film still manages to establish all the main details. The actors have once again improved, and the characters themselves now all have understandable and relatable motives. The mystery is excellent, the effects are wonderful, and the stakes have risen to new heights. A wonderful film, for a wonderful book.",

This year, the legendary Tri-Wizard Tournament brings the arrival of two competing schools to Hogwarts. When Harry's name is unexpectedly drawn by the Goblet of Fire to compete in the tournament---even though he is not eligible and is technically a fourth player---he must still compete in the dangerous contest.\n\nI really enjoyed this new Harry Potter film.  While condensed quite a bit from the largest novel in the series to date, screenwriter Steve Kloves streamlined J.K. Rowling's 700-plus-page opus into cinematic fighting form.  Meanwhile, director Mike Newell delicately balances between whimsy and the ominous, on the uncertain middle ground where Harry lives, poised between fun at school, teenage romance, and an ever-deepening dark abyss.  And the special effects, which threatened to overwhelm the first two movies, are seamlessly integrated here.  But the best part of the film are Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson, who are becoming amazing actors in their own right.  Who would have ever thought when these three kids were cast in these iconic roles all those years ago that they would be the best part of these films?  In a word, incredible!  Four-and-a-half stars.",

The Goblet Fire takes a giant step away from the formula set by the first three films. This makes it not only unpredictable but also much more exciting. It manages to carry over the darker tone set by Prisoner of Azkaban but also raises the stakes even higher. Although Harry never finds himself in easy situations, this task is definitely a frightening one. Aside from that, the way the friendship dynamic between Harry and Ron is handled in the film is great. Ron finally speaks up about how frustrating it can be being Harry Potter's best friend. It also made their friendship after the events even stronger. The way the film ends is nice as well, it is a concrete ending but leaves you wanting more. I'm excited to continue the franchise but don't know how easy it will be for the further sequels to compete against the high bar raised by this eventful fourth installment.",

With the director of the third movie wash't going to direct the fourth movie, and is directed by Mike Newell, I figured that it wasn't going to be as grand as the third movie. Unfortunately I was right, but like the other films, it's still amazing. The cast are maturing, and improving too with age. The special effects are getting better as usual, and the plot is actually more different than I thought was going to be which is now a competition movie with a little of mystery in it. Like Gary Oldman, one of the highlights of the movie is  Brendan Gleeson who is hilarious in this, and also Ralph Fiennes who is really intimidating and is really creepy. Steve Kloves really knows how to write serious scenes and there's also some funny moments as usual from the Harry Potter films. Only problem I had, is that there wasn't more character development on some of the characters. I didn't know much of the competitors except Cedric Diggory a bit.

It (and, by extension, its film adaptation) has to bridge the gap between the middle-school feel of the first three stories, and the more adult themes of the last two books. The result is a little awkward and disjointed, but there are still some good parts.\n\nThere were some pretty major departures from the book here. This is, to a certain degree, understandable, as this book is significantly longer than its predecessors. What I take issue with is the adding in of extra scenes that could have been replaced with more plot-critical stuff. I take particular issue with the Horntail chase during the first task, and that awful mosh pit during the Yule Ball (I have never come so close to wanting to get up out of the theatre during a Potter film as I did here).\n\nAs always, we\u0092ve added some new cast members. Probably the biggest new part is Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody. He gives the role a certain uniqueness, although he plays it a little too comical (those are not words I would have ever expected to write). We also get Roger Lloyd-Pack as Barty Crouch Sr, who I didn\u0092t particularly care for; he had too many nervous ticks. On the other hand, his son was played by David Tennant, who I could gush about for another 30 000 words (I really like David Tennant, you guys). Pity he didn\u0092t have a bigger part. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn\u0092t mention every woman\u0092s favourite vampire, Robert Pattinson, who played Cedric Diggory. He did solidly, but was underwritten.\n\nThe tone of this film is significantly darker, signalling to us that we have left the innocence of childhood behind, and are about to enter a more adult world, filled with moral greys and ever-increasing danger.",

It is still as magical as it can get. But expect some creepy and frightening images as it goes further. To sum it up, the story is about Harry Potter unexpectedly chosen to be one of the Champions competing in the Tri - Wizard Tournament as a representative for Hogwarts. He's suspecting, someone is behind all of this. The film has some humorous, funny side. Like for instance, the yule ball dance ball scene. In short, It also shows the lighter side of the franchise. That is cool to me. The more the plot rolls on and on. It gets more interesting, and I want more. Can't wait  for the next stop. I would say definitely, this is a memorable episode of the story definitely. And as a movie goer, I enjoyed it pleasingly. 4.5/5",

The chronology of the characters is perfectly aligned with the subject matter, the turmoil of the teenage years in human experience perfectly captured in the story at hand. The hilarious dance sequence is flawless, insightfully depicting the strange mixture of excitement and drama accompanying dances at a younger age, but is rapidly succeeded by thrilling action, chilling turns, and solid development of characters and relationships. What's not to love about Harry, Hermione and Ron at this point? I'm finally sold on this whole Harry Potter business.\nAlso, hurrah for the special effects finally being up to snuff!\nFor the record, watching this particular episode in a post-Hunger Games society may make one acutely uncomfortable at the thought of a dangerous tri-wizard tournament, as the thematic similarities are uncanny. It didn't detract from the film, but I frequently agonized in frustration at Dumbledore allowing all this business to go on.",

            "content": "It has become increasingly common for different instalments of a film franchise to be helmed by different directors. Even in a series as long-running as James Bond, it was quite common for directors like Guy Hamilton and John Glen to helm several consecutive stories. With the brand now seemingly more important than any form of directorial stamp, it is more usual for different hands to come in and do things their way, albeit within clearly set parameters.\n\nAll of which brings us to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the halfway point of the Harry Potter series. With Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n electing not to direct a second film, and moving on to Children of Men, the job was given to Mike Newell, best known for the Oscar-nominated comedy Four Weddings and a Funeral. But whatever misgivings one may have about his back catalogue, the appointment paid off, with Goblet of Fire matching its predecessor in many respects and possibly even improving in others.\n\nNewell's versatility as a director is evident throughout Goblet of Fire, in that he is required to pull off many different kinds of scenes and handle several key emotional developments in the characters. Goblet of Fire was the point at which the Harry Potter books began to grow in size, which in turn meant that the filmmakers had to cram a lot more into the adaptations. Newell deliberately chose to \"put aside\" all elements of the novel which were not directly linked to Harry's journey, and the result is that the film remains a generally focussed effort, despite being the second-longest at 157 minutes.\n\nIn my review of the previous instalment, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I commented that the film did a good job of setting up conflict between the three main characters, challenging Harry's image of a \"goody two-shoes\" and deepening the characters as a result. Newell's effort builds on this in spades, with all three characters now firmly in the throes of adolescence and Harry struggling with his reputation as the chosen one as his visions grow stronger and more terrifying.\n\nOne of the most refreshing and entertaining aspects of Goblet of Fire is seeing our three main characters go through periods of intensely hating each other. This may sound like schadenfreude, coming from a man who's always preferred Tolkien to Rowling, but conflict is essential to good drama, and the series was still playing catch-up after the emotional stodge of the first two films. Our three heroes are at a point where their identities are being called in question by forces beyond their control, whether their own hormones or the Dark Lord. Under such circumstances, in-fighting is not only expected, it should be welcomed.\n\nIt's for this reason that the ball scene is one of the best in the entire film. For all the thrilling spectacle of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, scenes like this are the emotional heart of the film. There is a degree of empathy that we share with the characters before any of the arguments occur: we remember how dorky and nervous we seemed at our high school dances. But once we see Hermione erupt at her embarassment, or Ron scowl at her in resentment, it all comes alive. By making us question these friendships so comprehensively, it makes the more malevolent moments more weighty, giving us more to fear and less on which to depend.\n\nMuch of Goblet of Fire is concerned with identity and about characters having to pretend to be something they're not. Harry spends the entire film in a state of reluctance: while he doesn't go all mopey about it, he clearly doesn't want to be involved in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. On the other side, we have Barty Crouch Jr. (played well by David Tennant), who uses polyjuice potion to impersonate a teacher and gain Harry's confidence. Both characters are under pressure to live up to their identities, with Harry even struggling to fight Voldemort in their climactic battle in the graveyard. The only real distinction between them is choice: Crouch chooses to be driven by malice, while Harry's destiny is already sealed.\n\nWhen the book was released, Rowling gave many interviews in which she cited the story's main theme as one of bigotry. She said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that it was \"probably the thing I detest most. All forms of intolerance, the whole idea of 'that which is different from me is necessarily evil'.\" It would be fair to assume that the main vehicle for this theme would be Voldemort, whose contempt for muggles is conveyed in the graveyard. But the film also focusses on bigotry as an advanced form of favouritism, something evident in Draco Malfoy's behaviour and to a certain extent in the tournament.\n\nThis brings us on fittingly to the return of Voldemort, specifically his return to a physical body and the performance of Ralph Fiennes. Bringing Voldemort back was bound to happen sooner or later, and Newell and screenwriter Steve Kloves work hard to justify this, gradually building up the darker aspects of the plot until it becomes tragically inevitable. After this instalment the series struggled to keep Voldemort interesting, with the final conflict between him and Harry being steadily delayed for increasingly contrived reasons. But within the confines of this film, it works - at least up to a point.\n\nFiennes' performance has often been a sticking point with fans, with people being split over whether he was truly intimidating or unintentionally hilarious. It's certainly true that Fiennes walks the line between horror and comedy, and not always with confidence: while it's not exactly Victor Quartermaine from Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, it's a much more larger-than-life villain than Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. Ultimately Fiennes does what the film needs to do, giving Voldemort a believable presence and showing the threat he poses to Harry. It's not a complete success, but it fulfils the requirements of the role.\n\nOthers within the adult cast fare far better in delivering convincing portrayals. David Tennant may be associated with heroic roles after his tenure on Doctor Who, but his performance as Barty Crouch, Jr. has an appealingly skin-crawling quality. He manages to maintain an almost manic state without ever coming across as a ham, allowing his outbursts to become properly threatening. The late Roger Lloyd Pack is also good as his father, a bureaucrat who seems racked with guilt and nerves for what he did to his son and the peril which Harry is in. And Brendon Gleeson is perfectly cast as Mad Eye Moody, bringing his unusual physicality to the fore in the classroom scenes and giving us a lot to laugh at when he's angry.\n\nThe other big asset of Goblet of Fire is its visuals. Roger Pratt returns as cinematographer, having previously lent his talents to Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. No longer shackled by Chris Columbus, he does a much better job here, continuing the work of Cuar\u00f3n and Michael Seresin of bringing out the dark blues and blacks for an intimidating atmosphere. Pratt is a fantasy veteran, having worked with Terry Gilliam on Brazil, The Fisher King and 12 Monkeys; he knows a thing or two about creating a sense of magic or horror, making the maze scenes feel like they've escaped from The Shining.\n\nThere are a couple of faults with Goblet of Fire which prevent it from completely surpassing its predecessor. Despite Newell's best efforts and intentions to keep the action focussed on Harry, the plot still feels occasionally meandering, as if more effort were being expended on something than was necessary. Whole sections of the book have been left out, and others changed so that different characters could get screen time, and it may be that elements of the books simply don't work on film. But it's still a baggy offering, even if it's an enjoyable one.\n\nThe other flaw, as with many of the Potter films, is predictability. I complained in my Prisoner of Azkaban review about the Defence Against the Dark Arts convention, which has gone from being a mild irritation to an example of lazy writing. Equally Harry's inclusion in the wizard tournament may turn out to be narratively integral, but the circumstances in which he becomes involved are an enormous contrivance. It feels like the plot is making every effort to keep Harry at the centre of the action even when it doesn't make sense, to the point of setting up rules only to break them. The smart, or at least different thing to do, would be to have him completely marginalised, letting Voldemort approach him more directly rather than luring him in through coincidences. \n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a confident addition to the franchise which builds on the successes of its predecessor to create an emotionally satisfying experience. It still suffers from the ongoing flaws of bagginess and predictability, facets which would become more problematic during David Yates' tenure. But if you can look beyond that, you are looking at a film which rivals Prisoner of Azkaban as the high point to which the other films aspire.",

The only problem I had was some of the acting and this brought down the score a lot. Daniel was pretty great in the other films, but he seemed to slack off in this one. Also what the hell was up with the long hair in this movie. Did they all decide to grow it out because everyone had long hair here. I so have give this movie credit. This is the first time where hermione is actually old enough to be hot. \n\nThe Tri wizard Tournament  is where this movie shines. Each challenge was more frightening than the next and the emotional content of the film was very good. Overall this wasn't harry potter standard, but not the worst so far. 8/10",

Dragons, merpeople, and a maze that climaxes in the grip of Lord Voldemort, this movie had me in for a new take on the Potter saga. Loved seeing Ralph Fiennes dub the role of Voldemort at the climax (his only scene) and the different twists and turns along the way with action, a bit of romance and thrills throughout. Another great film for all Potter fans!!!",
