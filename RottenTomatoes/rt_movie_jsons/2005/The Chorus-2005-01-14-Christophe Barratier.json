    "summary": "Pierre (Jean-Baptiste Maunier) is an aimless child at an austere boarding school in France. The students and faculty are constantly at odds with one another, until a music teacher, Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot), arrives and starts a choir. Clément -- who has troubles of his own -- tries to change the reactionary policies of the school, choosing instead to encourage his students. His efforts have a particular impact on Pierre, who shows great musical promise.",

Setting out to change the culture, he soon finds that he is impacting on the lives of his charges, most notably singing prodigy Pierre.  It is the sort of movie that you can't help but think you've seen countless times before, but The Chorus never slides into shameless sentimentality like many of its counterparts.  Granted, it is very predictable and very talky, but the strong performances by the entire cast and an important message put it a notch above others of its kind.",

On the one hand, film depictions of parent struggles often reveal the inhumane, insensitive colour of bureaucracy and an eagerness to deny seeking parents by any arbitrary means, meanwhile the children are in a sub-par environment where they're often not given much beyond life sustenance. On the other hand, sending the child to a masked abusive family is an utterly traumatising thought, and it'll be years before the child develops the maturity to speak out, if they ever get there. Ultimately what we want is to have children in a caring home with as much opportunity to pursue self-actualisation as they could afford. Facilitating a bridge between the family and the child, with the means to force transparency of the home may lead to better success. Alternatively, funding adoption centres to make them into education/career training centres could also avoid wasting their life and direct them to become productive members of society as they gain independence over the years, reducing the stress on sending them into homes.",

            "content": "I simply adored The Chorus!! It is a film where I was initially concerned the plot was going to be a complete retread. I mean, I’ve already seen movies like Going My Way, School of Rock, and Sister Act 2. However, while it shares rudimentary elements with those films The Chorus does it so much better than every single one of them. I’m a sucker for this kind of story about a kinder, gentler teacher excelling where his more strict counterparts have failed. It’s so rewarding to watch the slow progression that the students make from surprise to respect and eventually love for Mathieu. Each little beat of his impact on these kids feels earned and Gérard Jugnot is simply marvelous in the lead role. Then there’s the music! I cannot express how remarkable these songs sound. Since I have been a lifelong member of one choir or another, just hearing the melodies and harmonies make my heart soar. It doesn’t even matter that many of the lyrics are never translated for us because the tune delivers all the meaning I require. The boys they got to sing are marvelous and the soloist blew me away. I don’t know if the young boys who act in the movie are the ones singing, but it doesn’t matter to me, because the effect works. The quality of the music is also vital to making the story function properly, and it underscores a number of scenes in a more emotional fashion. In many cases I have found that framing sequences are a mistake, and I don’t know if it was necessary here either. I think it will be more powerful the next time I watch the movie now that I am aware who the gentlemen are in the opening scene and why I should care about the things that happen to them. In every other way I can think of, The Chorus is superb. I’ll readily admit that it’s not wholly original, and it might even have some predictable parts, but I did not care for even one second while watching it. This movie made my heart soar, and I was grinning like an idiot by the end while humming a beautiful tune. I offer my highest recommendation that others check out The Chorus, it is delightful!",

Mes premières impressions du film est que l'école était un très effraient place et le directeur M. Rachin était très méchant au gars. J'aime ce film beaucoup c'était très drôle et c'est très facile de relier avec les personnages. J'ai eu la difficulté de ne regarde pas. Et il y a un très bon message dans le film. M. Mathieu ne voulais pas enseigner la musique encore, mais quand il réalise que les gars peuvent chanter il décide de suivre ses passions et d'enseigner la musique encore. Alors, le message est de toujours suivre tes passions et rêves. Les acteurs étaient incroyable ils ont joué leurs rôles parfaitement! L'endroit pour l'école était parfaite aussi, s'ajoute à l'atmosphère effarant d'école. Et la musique était formidable, j'avais chaque chanson dans ma tête pour le reste du jour après qu'on a regarder le film. Je recommande ce film a n'importe qui!

I'm sure the ending would be different had it been made in America.

            "content": "I definitely think this film had some good intentions at heart, and I think it does a good job at fulfilling those intentions.  But there's no denying that this movie is as predictable as the day is long.  If you've seen any inspirational teacher-student drama then you, really, have seen them all.  There's little to no variation in them, other than what technique the teacher uses to influence and, ultimately, change his/her students.  This one uses music, and even THAT isn't unique to this film alone.  Mr. Holland's Opus comes to mind immediately.  With that said, and I don't really even care about this that much, but this was also the year Oldboy, my favorite movie of all time, and also generally regarded as one of the best foreign movies of the decade, in some case it's even regarded as one of the best movies of the decade period.  Guess which film got the Oscar Nomination for Best Foreign Film.  If you guessed this movie then pat yourself on the back and give yourself a cookie.  Good thing it didn't win either.  If it had it would've gone along with Tsotsi as one of the \"worst\" movies ever to win the Best Foreign Movie award.  That sounds a little harsh, since this film IS good, Tsotsi was average at best, but it would be the truth.  The fact that it gives off the idea that it was great doesn't actually make it great.  That's where a lot of the sentimentality comes into play.  That can legitimately confuse people with thinking they watched something great when they didn't.  I'm not saying that all people who thought this film was great were fooled, I'm sure some have legitimate reasons for thinking that.  But I'm gonna say that a big chunk, maybe not the majority, but a big chunk, bought into the sentimentality and it made them believe something that, to me, isn't true.  I suppose you have to give the film credit for that.  I hate to sound so harsh about the film, because I genuinely did like it.  I thought the score was excellent and the acting was more than solid, with Gerard Jugnot, the teacher, being immensely likable.  But, and this is something that Roger Ebert, wisely, said about the film, and that is the fact that this feels more like a Hollywood wannabe than a French film.  And I completely agree with that, wholeheartedly.  It, obviously, is a French film because, um, it comes from France and they speak French in it.  But, stylistically and thematically, this is very much an American movie.  If there's a reason that I watch foreign films, other than the fact that I tend to enjoy them more than some films from this side of the world, is to see the differences.  Whether that be in the culture, storytelling, film-making techniques, acting methods, editing styles, etc, etc.  I like to watch the differences from country to country.  And France, being one of the most creative countries in the world, probably has a better movie than this just right around the corner.  Take, for example, the Alan Partridge movie I just reviewed some hours ago.  That, while not technically a foreign-language film, is completely steeped in British culture.  You can sense the difference in style in Steve Coogan's comedic acting when compared to Will Ferrell, for example, on this side of the world.  And that's not even meant as insult as I'm a fan of Will Ferrell's.  Unfortunately, this film is content to walk the path countless others have gone down.  I'm shocked at the negativity that's coming out as I'm writing this review, I've spoken more about the negatives than the positives.  I know it's hard to believe, but I genuinely did like this film.  Solid cast, great music, and some genuine moments of heart and warmth.  But, and this is where I'll leave this, proof that sometimes good isn't good enough.  While you will enjoy your time with this film, you really wouldn't miss anything if you chose to skip it.",

            "content": "Outside of its Mr. Holland's Opus/Dead Poet's Society with a dash of Dickens formula, which it does well enough, the real reason, and reason alone, to watch Les Choristes, is the wonderful music. Composed by Bruno Coulais and sung by Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc, the soundtrack is a masterful feast of classical recordings. The story of the film follows failed musician Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot), who fittingly finds himself at the gates of Fond de l'Etang -- \"The Bottom of the Pond\" -- a boarding school for difficult boys.  Jugnot, as the puggish Mathieu who puts his faith in the boys because he has nothing left to lose, is a droll and endearing hero who rallies the cast to an inspirational musical awakening. And despite its unoriginality, the film is structured with such joy and merriment that the power of music really comes through in a way that feels like a believable catharsis for those in the halls of this school, dictatorial faculty included. \n\nWatch the movie, but at the very least get the soundtrack.",

Music not only teaches discipline, teamwork and timing, but it can actually affect and mould people's lives.\n\nI'm the kind of person who, upon hearing a brilliant piece of music, gets so overwhelmed that my eyes well up. And this film manages to do it on more than one occasion.\n\nPeople, and especially kids, need music in their lives; the world is a much beautiful place with music around.",

            "content": "\"The Chorus\" takes place in post-war France as boys were placed in\nboarding schools that were places of both repression and refuge. What I\nliked most about this film was Clement Mathieu, a failed musician who\ntakes a job as supervisor in the prison-like school, and his attitude\ntowards a group of unfortunate and misunderstood young boys. He treated\nthem with the utmost respect and believed that each one possessed a\nspecial gift or talent they could show the world. Two ideas I found\ninteresting were the importance of the children's needs of fathers in\ntheir lives is explored in this film. This idea can be easily accepted\nbecause of how quickly the children began to have respect for their\ninstructor. His kindness toward the children is returned to him by the\nstudents, as they respond to the way he teaches music to motivate and\ninterest them. The children's affection was demonstrated after their\ninstructor was fired by tossing goodbye letters out of the window as he\nwalked away from the school. Another interesting idea was how the\ncolors in the film set the mood for the audience. For example, to allow\nthe feeling of transformation within the school, the color goes from\ngrays, to bold and bright colors towards the end. Not only does this\ntype of detail help set the mood, but also allows the audience to feel\nas if they were one of students in the film. \n\nA couple of things that were particularly French were the food that the\nchildren were served, and the principle's (Rachin) attitude of\nsincerity and outspokenness. The music, which was created by the film\ndirector, gives the film the right tone. It has such a sweetness to it\nthat it disarms us and gets us into the right mood for enjoying it even\nmore. The acting was very outstanding, simple, and comical at times,\nespecially from Clement. The children were very sweet, especially the\nvery little Pepinot.\n\nThe director, Christophe Barratier, began his career as a classical\nguitarist, winning several international competitions. In 1991 he\njoined Galatee Films, where he was an associate producer on several\nmovies, including \"Winged Migration (2001). He then directed his first\nshort, Les Tombales (2002). He next wrote, directed and composed the\nmusic for his first film \"The Chorus\" (2005). This movie won the\nCrystal Heart Award at the Heartland Film Festival and has been\nnominated for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Foreign Language Film at\nthe BAFTA Awards.",
