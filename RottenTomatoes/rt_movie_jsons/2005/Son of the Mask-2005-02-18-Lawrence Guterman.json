When the curious canine finds a mask with mystical properties, both dog and baby create chaos with its powers. While Tim and Tonya try to contain the damage, the sly Norse god Loki (Alan Cumming) comes looking for the artifact, resulting in more mishaps that ultimately incur the wrath of the deity's powerful father, Odin (Bob Hoskins).",

The best thing is the music which is really bad with a mix of 50's music, Hip Hop, cartoonish and as you can tell it has no synergy at all. The pacing is off the walls and never slows down to take a breath, every single edit you notice in this and makes you just wish it would stop with the crazy stupid camera angles and horrifically bad special effects. The acting is a special kind of obnoxiously clueless over the top. This is if somebody merged baby geniuses, the mask, and sharkboy and lavagirl together. I don't know how I made it through this honestly, I think I had a breakdown after an hour and just didn't care anymore.",

Although it's a new vision and character (the reason why it doesn't feel like Jim Carrey is that it isn't Jim Carrey) it's a reminder of how art is truly for everyone and not everyone has to like it. This was a fun, cheesy film that may not be liked by many but was a produced film nonetheless and was at least the attempt and execution of a project. Something missing from this was the charm... But this is just my humble opinion.",

With that said, it's nothing so bad that it offended me - it's simply totally and utterly bad, to the point I kinda find it hard to hate on it because I just don't have any thoughts on it. It is, without question, undoubtedly worse than 1994's 'The Mask' in every conceivable way though.\n\nJamie Kennedy's version of this Dark Horse Comics character is truly dreadful, especially visually, though thankfully the film doesn't actually give that much air time to Kennedy as The Mask; like, he's there but it's predominantly the dog and the son that get much of the screen time alongside Alan Cumming's Loki - to slightly better effect too, the way the kid is animated kinda nearly works... it doesn't, but almost.\n\nRyan Reynolds, according to Kennedy himself, possibly wanted this role. It's lucky Reynolds didn't get his way, or he'd be stuck with a green ghoul in his past. Oh, wait!\n\n4/10 is probably generous on my part, though there are far worse films out there that actually annoy me - 'Son of the Mask' honestly doesn't. It kinda just exists and I'm almost nonplussed about it.",

            "content": "The original film with Jim Carrey was a clever and hilarious film, with a very sophisticated and dynamic visual style. What a way to ruin such a fantastic film, with such a poor sequel? It does make me sad. I will give some credit, it isn't quite the worst movie I have ever seen, Disaster Movie, Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 and Home Alone 4 were worse, but judging by how really poor the film is, that is not saying much.\n\nLet me start by saying the script was quite terrible, very clich√©d and stale, with nothing new to expand from its predecessor. And the direction from Laurence Guterman, who also directed Cats and Dogs, which is much more decent, was close to incompetent. The story about the magical mask falling into the hands of a cartoonist who fathers a son is rather substandard and takes a while to get going.\n\nThe special effects and animation attempts to spark some imagination, but it completely lacks the visual style that made the original so endearing to look at. Intead the whole film looks cheap in comparison and looks like it was made for TV, despite the valiant attempts of the animators to make it look good. The casting is uninspired to say the least. Jamie Kennedy as the cartoonist lacks charisma, and I will say I found the baby really creepy. Alan Cumming is a very talented actor, and has been in some great films namely the wonderful 1994 version of Black Beauty where his voice over of the beloved horse was note perfect. Here he can't do anything with his villainous role, which is so badly underwritten it's not hard to see why. And how Bob Hoskins got dragged into this I shall never know.\n\nAll in all, I can see why people say this movie is bad, it is. Not just because it is not a true sequel but also it is substandard in comparison to its much superior predecessor in terms of sophistication and quality. Not quite the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is bad! 1/10 Bethany Cox",

Perhaps he was worried that an exuberant, high-energy performance would be considered a poor copy of Jim Carrey's excellent performance in the original film. Carrey's outgoing, over-the-top comedic skills were perfect for the original Mask film, but it is also what the main character demands. Sadly, Kennedy is either unwilling or unable to deliver a similar  energy. The plot is childish and uninspired, as is the acting. Son of the Mask is charmless and unfunny, which is a shame because there should have been room for at least one decent sequel in the Mask franchise, perhaps drawing on the original comic book series for inspiration.",

When Jamie Kennedy puts on the mask, he looks like plastic. Carrey didn't face that problem when he put on the mask. A plothole also ends up in the movie. The first film implies that it only works at night but the dog gets to remain with it for as long as he wants. The movie is also downright bizarre, and not in a good way. Basically, after watching the Michigan J Frog cartoon where the frog pretends to be a normal frog when the guy who caught him singing tries to show it to other people, Kennedy's baby decides to mess with him using the Mask's powers to get him committed largely for his own amusement.

The comedy of the film is dreadful, but if they went for horror instead, this could have worked (Especially with scenes of violence, like Jamie Kennedy's character strangling his wife and slamming her head against the floor). It could have been a great psychological horror film, but alas, it's instead a dreadful comedy aimed at children (Though it feels rather inappropriate for children).",

            "content": "I kind of enjoyed it. Sort of.\nI mean, I like it a lot more looking back then I did initially when I watched it.\n\nI think what I like about it, is it's dark humour and the fact it tries to be it's own story without *gasp* Jim Carrey. Which honestly, I feel like The Mask is a story that needs a different protagonist if you're going to make a sequel. Seriously, why have a mask that can give anybody super powers if you're only going to have one guy ever use it.\n\nThat being said, they should have gotten someone actually funny using the mask. Like, maybe someone who's an actually comedian? I don't know.\n\nThe baby and dog plot could have been explained a little better. Like how can a baby be born of a mask? I mean, I get the whole it was worn while they had sex, but I don't know, it seems to be a weird power it suddenly has. Also, how come the baby is so smart and psychotic? Is just cause he has mask power ? It kind of makes sense (especially if you read the comics) but again, you can't just throw that at an audience and expect them to accept that (or still like the baby character).\n\nAlso, that dog is way too smart. I know Milo from the first movie was crazy smart but the dog is like way too aware of everything (and why did Tim make him his own room, that's just crazy devotion to your dog there).\n\nI don't know if I like Loki's inclusion or not. On the one hand he's kind of funny and Loki makes sense in this universe cause we established in the last film he made the mask. On the other hand he's a weak villain and you might not like Loki, god of mischief, to portrayed by essentially a teenage brat that never grew up (though, I guess that's what the Marvel universe's Loki is like too *sting*)\n\nI think the plot is okay if not meandering at the beginning, but the first Mask meandered too and nobody thought ill of it. While we're comparing the two, they both had pretty weak villains (though Loki is arguably more interesting than Dorian).\n\nAnd before anybody gets all riled up, I'm not saying this is as good as the Mask. It's not. If I were to give them grades I would give this movie a C and The Mask a B+. The Mask is by far the better film though I think if it didn't have Jim Carrey, the script would fail (much like how Iron Man would have failed if not for Robert Downey Junior).\n\nHowever Son of the Mask, has no saving grace. The story doesn't really take off until the second half, and if you're not the type to like dark humour (like me) you're going to hate it. That's why I give this a three star, because it's something I like a guilty pleasure but I don't think it's one of those things that really warrants anything above average.\n\nThere's a lot left to say but I think the gist is gotten. The last thing I will say is that visually it's a mess. There are some okay visuals there (though again, if you don't like creepy imagery, you're going to hate it) but there's a lot of it that feels and looks extremely cheap. It also lacks a lot of creativity that the mask had. Half of the stuff I've seen here I've seen elsewhere in other movies.\nAnd that's where The Mask really does shine above this because it's not just creative but the effects really hold the test of time.  So as a sequel to that movie it fails, but if you look at it alone, it's alright.",

Then let's take away every single good performance and everything worthwhile, add copious amounts of unnecessary mythology and plastic hair and crappy CGI and then you've got Son of the Mask\n\nLet's start of simple. Our main hero, The Mask, is no longer portrayed by the likeable Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) but the somewhat annoying and not at all exciting Tim Avery. (Jamie Kennedy) Now, I like Kennedy in his previous work, but this, it's just not the same, the way he portrays The Mask is not at all how it has ever been before, Comic, Movie, TV, or video games, it's this weird mash up of a wax Conan O'Brian and the Burger King guy, with a terrible Elvis like voice. Our once likeable lead starts off with a terrible dance number, putting the song \"You're just to good to be true\" Into Dance, country and other terrible versions all while using a zoom lens basically the entire time.\n\nThe Mask then has sex with Tim Avery's wife, and then she has a baby which is not truly Avery's, but the Mask's, or Loki's or whatever. The next hour or so is basically close up shots of Avery being scared while a sometimes real sometimes terrible CGI baby tries to put him into a mental hospital for what seems to be for no reason. The baby may feel that he's not his real dad, and that the mask is or something I don't know, but then he ends up randomly changing his mind and deciding he loves him at the end.\n\nAlso, while Avery is not wearing the mask (Which is the majority of the film, what's even the point) the dog is, which is a terrible re-hash of a joke from the first where the dog found the mask and started hurting BAD GUYS, and in this one, the dog tries to kill THE BABY. Why? Well this theory is a little more clear as the dog feels like he isn't getting enough attention but still, this movie relies way too much on it's bad CGI as that's really all the 2nd act is, that and Loki (Alan Cumming) running around looking for his mask wearing unsettling costumes.\n\nThat's another thing. This movie is quite unsettling to children. A dog's eyeballs literally pop out and for about 10 seconds the dog has empty eye sockets. A man's face is taken off his body. A baby's face randomly changes into a scarier one, the movie's inappropriate for kids, and the first films audience is 13 and higher and wouldn't be interested, so who's the audience? No one. No one wants this film. It just needs to go join the other terrible sequel corner. The plot has potential but it's taken no where because they want to entertain us with bombastic frantic absolutely unnecessary CGI effects and some reaaaally bad acting at times. (See Steven Wright) Possibly if they stuck with the premise but maybe had, hmm, a better script, Jim Carrey, any funny scene, less Norse shit, and better CGI, it might have been a good film, but... unfortunately, it isn't. at all. But I do give it credit for making me at least smile like, once. That's it. That's the half a star.",

Son of the Mask is the perfect example of terribly unnecessary sequel. \r\n\r\nThe original, which starred Jim Carrey and began the career of Cameron Diaz, was lightyears ahead of this tripe. A wholly bizarre cluster of colour and the shameful theme of idiotic-parent trying to control toddler, which don't work in the slightest.\r\n\r\nAlan Cumming, in his typical role of blumbering oaf, is this time the unconvincing villian. In a more general tone to account for all of his movies, weirdo-on-a-mission, he is trying to find his mask which fell onto Earth and is known to confide special powers.\r\n\r\nJamie Kennedy is the idiot father in this story, and Traylor Howard (\"Razzie Award for her role in Son of the Mask, please!\"), of the hopeless sitcom 'Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place', unnecessarily fills the shoes of the mother of the mischevious baby, wincingly-named Albie. Both are incompetent in their roles, and it was very hard to watch.\r\n\r\nSo, if you are a fan of sla-dash animation, dull characters, unfunny action and terrible acting, this could just become your favourite movie ever.

Everything that was great about the first one has been thrown in the bin.\n\nThe CGI baby is so creepy, you'll have nightmares for weeks. The FX are awful. They had a budget of 80 mil and they could do any better. The first one was made with 18 mil and the FX in that one looked great.\n\nEvery scene feels the need to be silly, unlike the original where the silly scenes only happened when Stanley put on the mask.\n\nIt's also disgusting, if you're into urine, vomit and snot jokes, this is up your street.\n\nThe whole plot where the dog is trying to kill the baby is just............. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE FILMMAKERS?\n\nThe main character only puts the mask on twice and the make up looks awful. Plastic hair, really? In the first one, when Dorian and Milo put the mask on, they had their own, although howcome Stanley didn't have hair when he had the mask on? Hmm?\n\nAlso, thank you filmmakers for messing up Norse mythology. Loki is a night god and what is he doing walking around in the daytime? Remember in the first movie it says the mask only works at night because Loki is a night god. DUH! \n\nLoki is also not the son of Odin. They got that from Marvel's Thor. And also, if Odin knew that a child had been born from the mask, WHY COULDN'T HE TELL LOKI WHERE THE MASK WAS INSTEAD OF LOKI GOING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE LOOKING FOR IT? This film makes me so angry!\n\nSo, is there anything I like? Two things; Alan Cumming and Bob Hoskins. Bob said that Super Mario Bros was the worst film he'd done. I think he better take that back. Best not to mention this film to either of them if you meet them. Or any of the cast for that matter.\n\nWe waited 11 years for a sequel to the Mask and this is what we get? Rent the original, read the comics or watch the cartoon instead.\n\nSOMEBODY STOP THE DVD PLAYER!",

I can't tell if the director of photography was an inexperienced hack or trying to break crazy, new ground, but either way, what they did here doesn't work. Your eyes are constantly wandering to the wrong parts of frames, you're constantly expecting things to happen that don't and so forth - all because it's badly shot.\r\nStill, aspects of the story are interesting. Loki coming to Earth to retrieve the mask for instance is quite a nice idea for a sequel. It's a shame that they threw in a load of crap about a baby. But even then, it's not like the Loki stuff is good. It's handled in a horribly cheesey way and isn't very funny. \r\n\r\nUltimately, this film slots right in with the list of other crappy Jim-Carrey-less sequels such as 'Evan Almighty', 'Ace Ventura Jr' and 'Dumb and Dumberer'.\r\n\r\n3/10",

Loki, whom is the God rejected by all, must go to Earth and find where is the mask. As the film progresses Tim gets in possession of the mask and finally has the right to stand up for himself. Accidentally he gets his wife pregnant while having the mask, now a baby was born with the powers of the mask. Now Tim must find a way to solve his new problems before chaos erupts.\r\nThis movie fails on all levels of a movie. This movie should have been called Epic Fail! Nothing in this movie is funny. Nothing! The acting of the protagonists is really dull and boring. I mean Jamie Kennedy is no Jim Carrey! There can be no one that will replace Jim's character. How dare they make a sequel without him! The dialogue is really cheesy and platonic. The dialogue is so bad and terrible that will make you stop watching this movie. I seriously wanted to stop watching this fiasco and it's a miracle that I watched the entire movie. For example this stupid joke of \"Who's the fish?\" It was really dull, pathetic and annoying that I wish that both them will sleep with the fishes. Seriously this movie is not funny at all! The plot is illogical that insults your intelligence. If you are a god and you want a mask, why don't you do some magic to get it back. Nope they act like complete dull humans looking for it like if they were some stooges. None of the scenes of this movie were good; everything in this movie was a complete disaster! The pace of this movie was a complete fiasco because it was going too fast and fails from outside logic. Visual-effects just can't replace a story, it can't happen and it will never happen because people will feel alienated with it! It just proves that you can't make a successful movie with making everything look cartoony; it didn't make me feel animated. \r\nWhat I like about the film? Absolutely nothing! I hate this movie. It was just awful. The premise was interesting because we get to see something new; I think it was interesting to see a baby born with the powers of the mask. This sequel fails on all levels from the first movie. It was missing the cleverness, the fun, and witty dialogue from the first movie. The problem with this movie is a gross-out comedy, even it supposed to be a \"family\" film, the only thing that this movie does is make you vomit like the baby did in the movie. The film was unnecessary, nihilistic, gross and utterly boring! The only thing good about this movie is that it had a proper ending! \r\nI hate sequels and Son of the Mask contains all the reasons why I hate sequels. The film is a complete and utter failure because there is no humor in this movie, it is just so freaking bad that makes you want to hit somebody! The film was directed by Lawrence Guterman and I want you to remember the man that ruined the film! He also has directed pointless movies that don't deserve to be called comedy like Cats and Dogs. This film can't be said anything positive about it.  \r\nI can't believe I will say this but don't watch this movie! That's the only recommendation I can give you for this movie. Believe me I am saving from watching one of the worst films of all time! If you loved the first movie then you are going to hate this movie because it insults all the things that were on the previous movie, this movie just destroys everything good about the first film. If you like gross-out comedies than perhaps you will like this movie...perhaps.",

I know, strange.  And boy I was glad that I didn't see this. I enentually saw it on Cartoon Network (right TV channel to air this film on) and felt stupid throughout the entire broadcast. The jokes are not funny, the story is too simple-minded, and the effects were horrid. The first \"Mask\" movie was good because if Jim Carrey was spinning his legs around like a Looney Tune character, his face would not be computer-generated. But here, if the little baby is doing cartoony things, they horridly make his face all CGI. I am sorry for all those who were victims of the film's terribleness. Is that even a word?

II Rating: 4 stars out of 5 stars\r\n\r\nMovie review written by Hector Fernando Andrade JR. II\r\n\r\nOn Feburary 18, 2005 my mom, my little brother, my paraprofessional from Elementary School, her son and I went to his movie theather called Cinema 6 for the first time to see The Son Of The Mask to cellabrate my paraprofessional son's 14 brithday. \r\n\r\nThe Son Of The Mask is sadily The Golden Raspberry Award winning action comedy movie sequel to The Mask, based on the series of horror comic books called The Mask created by Mike Richardson, Randy Stradley, Mike Badger, John Arcudi and Doug Mahnke and published by Dark Horse Comics. The Son Of The Mask was directed by Lawrence Guterman, produced by Kent Alterman, Tobey Emmerich, Sean Gorman, Erica Huggins, Stephen Jones, Scott Kroopf, Beau Marks, Mike Richardson, Tom Tataranowicz, Michele Weiss, New Line Cinema, Riddar Pictures and Dark Horse Entertainment, written by Lance Khazei and released to the movie theathers in the United States on Friday Feburary 18, 2005. The Son Of The Mask stars Jamie Kennedy as Tim Avery also known as The Mask, Alan Cumming as the villianous Loki The Mythologcall God Of Mischief, Traylor Howard as Tonya Avery, Liam Falconer and Ryan Falconer as Alvey Avery, Kal Penn as Jorge, Steven Wright as Daniel Moss and Bob Hoskins as Odin The Mythologcall King Of Norse Mythology.\r\n\r\nSo my mom, my little brother, my paraprofessional, her son and I went to the movie theather and paid and got our five movie tickets and our Popcorn and our drinks of Coca-Cola and we went into the movie theather and sat down in our seats with our Popcorn and our drinks of Coca-Cola and watched The Son Of The Mask.\r\n\r\nStory: Not long after the release of The Mask, it was announced in Nintendo Power that Jim Carrey would be returning as Stanley Ipkiss also known as The Mask in a sequel called The Mask II. The magazine held a contest where the first prize winner would be awarded a walk-on role in the film. Director Charles Russell, who helmed the original film, expressed his interest in The Mask II in his 1996 DVD commentary he was hoping Jim Carrey would reprize his role as Stanley Ipkiss also known as The Mask, along with Amy Yasbeck, who played newspaper reporter for \"Ask Peggy\" and The Eveing Star and The Tribune reporter Peggy Brandt in The Mask. Russell decided to cut scenes when Peggy dies and leave the character open for the sequel but due to Jim Carrey declining to reprise his role of Stanley Ipkiss also known as The Mask, the project never came to fruition, Charles backed out. Many actors were considered for a new Mask role but Charles wanted Jim Carrey and decided not to return and the concept for the sequel was completely changed. The screenplay of The Son Of The Mask was written by Lance Khazei, based on an original screenplay that he wrote titled Baby Formula. Baby Formula was never intended to be a sequel to the Mask nor was it originally intended to be a familly movie. Baby Formula has been described as having been inspired by Rosemary's Baby and Who Framed Roger Rabbit and originally intended for a more adult audience but then Lance changed his mind and decided to make Baby Formula a movie sequel to The Mask called The Son Of The Mask with a new story, a new set of chracters and a new setting. The story of The Son Of The Mask in a small summary goes like this: 7 years after the adventures that Stanley Ipkiss had with the mask, on a rain and thunderstorm night Dr. Aurthur Neuman (played by Ben Stein) is giving a tour of the hall of Norse Mythology at The Edge City Museum Of Arts and Mythology in the city of Edge City. A man dressed in hiding Black comes in to view the hall. When Dr. Neuman reaches the part concerning the creation of the mask he tries to get it but Dr. Newman sees him and tells him not to touch the mask display, and when Dr. Neuman reaches the part concerning Loki's imprisonment, the stranger becomes very angry and transforms, revealing himself to be the villianous Loki The Mythologcall God Of Mischief (played by Alan Cumming), who has come down to Earth from Asgard to get his mask back. The tourists panic and flee, but Dr. Neuman stays to argue with the angry god. Loki takes his mask, but realizes it is a fake. In anger he removes Dr. Neuman's still talking face from his body and puts it on the mask's stand and fakliy shoots some security guards and puts them into a hole before storming out of the museum in a whirlwind of rage. The next day in a town called Fridge City, Tim Avery (played by Jamie Kennedy), an aspiring cartoonist at an animation company, is feeling reluctant to become a father. He has a beautiful wife named Tonya Avery (played by Traylor Howard), and a best friend, Jorge (played by Kal Penn), who is very shy around women. Tim has a close relationship with his dog Otis (played by Bear the dog), who finds an ancient mask in a faroff creek and brings it to his owner's house. Tim puts on the mask for a Halloween party, transforming into a party animal that is similar to the mask character from the first film. At the party, Tim ogles a young woman named Sillva, (played by Victoria Thaine), eagerly confronts her, and uses his powers to have her stripped down to a skimpy costume and into Jorge's arms. When the company party turns out to be a bore, Tim uses his mask powers to perform a remix of Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You, therefore making the party a success, and giving Tim's boss Daniel Moss (played by Steven Wright) the idea for a new cartoon show. Tim returns to his house and, while still wearing the mask, has a sexual intercourse with his wife, conceiving a baby. 9 months latter It is Tuesday July 27, 2004 baby Alvey Avery (played by Liam Falconer and Ryan Falconer) is born and he has the same powers as Loki. Meanwhile, under the command of by his father Odin (played by Bob Hoskins) Loki is trying to find the child born from the mask, since if he finds the child, he will find the mask. Later, Tonya goes on a business trip to the city of New York City, leaving Tim with baby Alvey. Tim, who has been promoted at work, desperately tries to work on his cartoon at home, but is disrupted by baby Alvey. In order to get some peace and quiet, Tim lets Alvey watch television, while watching a Michigan J. Frog cartoon, baby Alvey devilishly obtains the idea to mess with his father's head by using his mask powers to make no one else believe him. Meanwhile, Otis the dog, who has been feeling neglected by Tim, dons the mask by accident and becomes a crazed animal version of himself, who wishes to get rid of Alvey to get his close relationship with Tim back. So baby Alvey and Otis the dog undergo a spectacular battle that turns the household upside down but the really big trouble begins when Loki finds out that Alvey the mask-born baby, and confronts Tim for the mask back and he will do whatever it takes to get his mask back from Tim, Alvey and Otis. I thought that the story of The Son Of The Mask was delightfully told.\r\n\r\nActing: The Son of The Mask is the first movie I have seen with Jamie Kennedy and the fifth movie I have seen with Alan Cumming and the first movie I have seen with Bob Hoskins, Traylor Howard, Liam Falconer and Ryan Falconer, Bear the dog, Kal Penn, Steven Wright and the second movie we have seen with Ben Stein.\r\n\r\nJamie Kennedy plays the role of Tim Avery also known as The Mask who is an aspiring cartoonist from Fringe City who is feeling incredibly nervous and reluctant to becoming a dad. He is the protagonist of the film. He lives with his beautiful wife Tonya and his dog Otis. His dog finds a mask that he puts on for a Halloween party becoming a crazed cartoonish version of himself.\r\n\r\nAlan Cumming plays the role of the villianous Loki The Mythologcall God Of Mischief who is the Norse night god of darkness and mischief. He vists The Edge City Museum Of Arts and Mythology in the city of Edge Cityhoping to find his mask that his father Odin has ordered him to find. After finding a baby was born from the mask, he takes a hospital list of babies born on July 27th to find the mask-born baby.\r\n\r\nBob Hoskins plays the role of Odin The Mythologcall King Of Norse Mythology who is Loki's father and orders him to find his mask on earth. After finding out there was a baby born from the mask, he orders Loki to find that baby as if he does, he'll find the mask.\r\n\r\nTraylor Howard plays the role of Tonya Avery who is Tim Avery's beautiful wife who wishes to have a baby although Tim doesn't. She remains oblivious of Alvey's mask abilities.\r\n\r\nLiam Falconer and Ryan Falconer both play the role of Alvey Avery who is the infant son of Tim and Tonya. He inherited the Mask's abilities.\r\n\r\nBear the dog plays the role of Otis the dog who is Tim's loyal pet dog. He shares a close relationship with Tim and even has his own dog room in Tim and Tonya's house. Later on, Otis thinks Tim is neglecting him so he puts on the mask and tries to get rid of Alvey, therefore getting all the attention again. He tries but fails several times.\r\n\r\nKal Penn plays the role of Jorge who is Tim's best friend at the animation company. Jorge is quite shy around women, but The Mask makes Jorge get over this by stripping down a women into a skimpy suit and into hs arms that pleases him. He works on the same floor as Tim and also wishes to become an animator, but doesn't bother to ask as he knows his chances are very slim.\r\n\r\nSteven Wright plays the role of Daniel Moss who is the head of Tim's animation company. Tim suggests his ideas to Daniel but refuses until he sees Tim wearing the mask at the company party which makes him want to promote Tim.\r\n\r\nBen Stein reprizes his role as Dr. Arthur Neuman who is a doctor and an expert on masks which Stanley Ipkiss consulted in The Mask who told Stanley that the object is a depiction of Loki The Mythologcall God Of Mischief. In The Son Of The Mask he's giving a tour of The hall of Norse Mythology at The Edge City Museum Of Arts and Mythology in the city of Edge City. When Dr. Neuman reaches the part concerning the creation of the mask he tries to get it but Dr. Newman sees him and tells him not to touch the mask display, and when Dr. Neuman reaches the part concerning Loki's imprisonment, the stranger becomes very angry and transforms, revealing himself to be the villianous Loki The Mythologcall God Of Mischief, who has come down to Earth from Asgard to get his mask back. The tourists panic and flee, but Dr. Neuman stays to argue with the angry mythologcall god. Loki takes his mask, but realizes it is a fake. In anger he removes Dr. Neuman's still talking face from his body and puts it on the mask's stand and fakliy shoots some security guards and puts them into a hole before storming out of the museum in a whirlwind of rage and the rest of the charming cast and all the acting from all the actors in The Son Of The Mask is fun and stylish.\r\n\r\nDirection: The Son Of The Mask is the second movie my mom, my little brother and I have seen that was directed by Lawrence Guterman. Director Lawrence Guterman direction as the director of The Son Of The Mask is creative and spectacular.\r\n\r\nVisuals: The special effects and visual effects of The Son Of The Mask were once again created and added by the special effects and the visual effects animators experts at Industrial Light & Magic. The special effects and the visual effects in The Son Of The Mask are terrific and amazing. Movie composer Randy Elderman creates some wonderful and charming music and I really liked the message in The Son Of The Mask which is \"Tim learning how to be a good father and inproving his reationship with his infant son\". What a sweet and heartwarming message.\r\n\r\nOverall: As it truns out my mom, my little brother and I all liked The Son Of The Mask, my paraprofessional from Elementary School and her 14 year old teenage son thought The Son Of The Mask was a corny comedy movie. I thought The Son Of The Mask was a fantastic, delightful, very funny and entertaning comedy movie sequel. So if fans of The Mask give The Son Of The Mask a chance and accept all the diffennces that The Son Of The Mask has from The Mask I think they will like The Son Of The Mask as well. The Son Of The Mask is the number 1 comedy movie sequel of the early spring time of 2005 and the year of 2005. The Son Of The Mask is a B+ memorable 4 stars excellent  comedy movie sequel. I give The Son Of The Mask two thumbs up and the score of 82 out of 100 and I hope you enjoy The Son Of The Mask.\r\n\r\n\"The Son Of The Mask is rated PG for action, crude and suggestive humor and language and The Son Of The Mask is 1 hour and 26 mintutes long\".\r\n\r\nMy movie review of The Son Of The Mask is being dedicated to the memory of Jance Kaskin. Jance Kaskin was one of the excectives at New Line Cinema who movie screenplay writter Lance Khazel pitiched the story of The Son Of The Mask to and she just imedatily got it and then she sadily died and passed away mid screen during The Son Of The Mask. May Jance Kaskin rest in peace and thank you and God bless you Jance Kaskin.",

Well....you would get a very bad movie. Son of the mask is WORSE!!!!!\r\n\r\nI have no idea why I checked this film out, even though I got it for free there was nothing positive I can take out of this experience. The first Mask has always been a classic and good entertainment. One of my favorite Jim Carrey films but Son of The Mask makes the first one look like Gone with the Wind in comparison.\r\n\r\nThis movie is painful, stupid, boring and of course unfunny on every level. But all those words aren't enough to express my feeling about this train wreck. I started feeling bad for the director and started wondering about the humor he possesses.\r\n\r\nJamie Kennedy looked like he enjoyed himself making this film. J.K is a funny guy but his selection of comedies worries me very much. It's also very sad to see names like Bob Hoskins, Alan Cumming, Kal Penn and Steven Wright on this film. I hope they got paid well for there parts because they didn't get any praise for it.\r\n\r\nThe V.E are okay and they try to be in style with cartoons but otherwise they suck. The little kid is sometimes so fake that he looks like something Polar Express denied from their films. I don't want to put more of my time analyzing this film so I am just going to sum it up.\r\n\r\n1/10 - IT SUCKS!",

            "content": "Son Of The Mask is a film nobody wanted, which perhaps explains why it's so eager to please. All director Lawrence Guterman wants is to make you laugh (and if possible, forgive him), but he tries too hard. His film strains so badly to be zany and funny that it comes across merely as flailing, hysterical desperation. This film needs a slap.\r\n\r\nSo, after the events of the original Mask film - we don't know how much time has passed, although presumably not a lot - the troublesome mask ends up in the possession of Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy), an immature animator with a broody young wife and a dog for a best friend. He goes to a Halloween work party, and of course, puts on the mask. The resulting transformation of Jamie Kennedy into Jamie Kennedy acting-like-a-smug-moron is an amazing mixture of misjudged, annoying and utterly unfunny. Avery/Mask performs a horrifying rap rendition of Can't Take My Eyes Off You, that I lamentably can't scrape out of my memories. He somehow impresses everyone to the extent that his boss, an animation mogul, gives him that show he's been dreaming of, provided it features the green character at the party. (What, the hideously unfunny and irritating green character?) Avery/Mask rushes home and sleeps with his wife, with the mask still on, and she gets pregnant. How lovely.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Loki (Alan Cumming), the Norse God whose mask it is, is on Earth trying to get his mask back. This means a lot of scenes of the apparently certifiable Alan Cumming adopting bad costumes and even worse accents while he checks to see if any newborn babies have Mask powers. These scenes are annoying, of course, but nothing compared to what's going on back at the Avery household.\r\n\r\nPoor Tim has been left alone with the baby, Alvy, who hates his Dad and wants to drive him insane. He does this by bursting into song and performing general CGI shenanigans. (He's inspired by that old cartoon with the singing frog, which is in Son Of The Mask just long enough to make us wish we were watching back-to-back Looney Tunes instead.) I was stunned to see Industrial Light & Magic credited at the end, because the special effects here, along with everywhere else in the film, look shoddy and unfinished. But the baby in particular is an awe-inspiringly awful creation, almost as misjudged and horrible to behold as Avery/Mask. Unsettling to look at, unfunny to watch, it's a case of writer and director making as much noise and movement as possible to distract from the absence of jokes. What were they thinking? When Tim's dog gets the mask - which, ignoring the logic of Film #1, stays on during the day-time - both dog and baby start trying to kill each other. These scenes at least have a near Looney Tunes rhythm about them, and there are several genuinely amusing little comedy footnotes here. I think of them as joke shrapnel.\r\n\r\nWith direction like this, however, you may miss them. Guterman has the camera constantly zooming and swooping around, obviously trying to make all of this as Zany And Funny as possible. It's wretchedly unpleasant to look at - seriously, how often do we need to see up Jamie Kennedy's nostrils? - and it's part of the film's big problem. In The Mask, Jim Carrey's green-faced demon is funny because he's juxtaposed against a normal(ish) world. The contrast of cartoon comedy and noiry crime is what makes it work. Here, however, everyone and everything seems to have some sort of hysterical cartoon logic, and it sucks the humour out of each cartoony sequence. By the end, four characters have used superpowers. The thrill has very much gone by then. It's just too much.\r\n\r\nAt least there's some kind of emotional story going on here. Tim is coming to terms with being a father, Alvy is coming to terms with having a father, and Loki is trying to get attention from Odin, who much prefers his other sons. In theory, this is good stuff. But the characters are written and acted so badly, I don't care about any of them. I hope Tim sells that thing to a laboratory and then gets a real job, and I couldn't give two hoots if Odin reduces his own nauseating offspring to charcoal.\r\n\r\nAside from the aforementioned joke shrapnel, there's nothing to recommend. Kennedy has played likeable and funny characters before, so why does he miss the mark so badly here? Cumming struggles with his American accent, as does Bob Hoskins (bafflingly cast as Odin), and his scenes suffer from just not being as funny as the filmmakers think. The actors, in general, look like they want to get out of here. (And who can blame them?) The plot is loose and forgetful, the jokes either bodily function or CGI-based, and the whole thing seems to have no grasp whatsoever of what's funny. Son Of The Mask is often repulsive, always annoying, and of course, it's totally pointless, since it's a sequel that makes no substantial link to its predecessor. The only honest-to-God good bits are the old cartoons characters sometimes watch. In comparison to that pitch-perfect short about the singing frog, Son Of The Mask could have been written and acted by drunken five-year-olds. \r\n\r\nIt's the kind of cinematic nightmare that sinks careers. The equivalent of poking yourself in the eyes for ninety minutes, I can think of no reason for you to watch this, other than the fact that, by the law of averages, even worse films probably exist in the world.",
