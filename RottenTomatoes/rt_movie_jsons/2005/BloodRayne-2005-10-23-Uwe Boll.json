    "summary": "In 18th-century Romania, after spending much of her life in a traveling circus, human-vampire hybrid Rayne (Kristanna Loken) escapes and plots to take down her evil vampire father, Kagan (Ben Kingsley). When she's discovered by three vampire hunters, Vladimir (Michael Madsen), Katarin (Michelle Rodriguez) and Sebastian (Matt Davis), she manages to convince them to spare her life and join her cause. But slaying a vampire as powerful as Kagan will be no easy task.",

            "content": "\"BloodRayne\" is a period vampire revenge story based on the game of the same name. However I was not quite sure when in time it was supposed to be based, as the movie fails to explain or establish its era. \"BloodRayne\" transports the audience into a weird fantasy World with over the top high octane action, real slasher moments and some stolen \"Matrix\" style scenes.\u00a0\n\nIt's hard to place \"BloodRayne\" into any sort of category as\u00a0the film is trying to be a number of different genres. The sets are good and the splatter, gore is constant but the script however is not great and the CGI is quite poor. I would suggest it is trying to be a sort of romantic, action, horror but unfortunately fails on pretty much all counts. \"BloodRayne\" boasts a terrific cast but given some of the lacklustre performances, the director definitely didn't get the best or make the most of the actors he had on set. I definitely expected more from Kristanna Loken, Billy Zane, Meatloaf and Ben Kingsley.\u00a0\u00a0It is however a watchable movie with some fun moments ( sometimes not for the right reasons ) and horrifically gory scenes but it's nothing more than another video game that does not translate well when given the big screen adaptation.",

            "content": "Saw 'Bloodrayne' and its two sequels out of curiosity to see if they were as bad as their terrible reputation. As well as seeing whether one of the worst directors of all time Uwe Boll was capable of making a good film. On top of that, like Ben Kingsley a lot as an actor and he is reason enough to see anything he's involved in. Did not have my hopes up, because even looking at the advertising and trailers 'Bloodrayne' looked awful.\n\nThe terrible reputation and dubious advertising do not lie. 'Bloodrayne' to me and many others really is that bad, bad actually is an understatement. Have come to the conclusion that Boll is incapable of making a halfway decent film, have not seen everything of his but all that has been seen has been terrible and as bad as their reputation. As someone who is usually very generous rating and reviewing films, 'Bloodrayne' does stand out as one of the worst films seen recently and actually full stop. Everything is abysmally executed and there are no redeeming qualities at all, have said that about very few films seen recently.\n\n'Bloodrayne' couldn't be more inept visually. Photography that is both chaotic and static, bacon-slicer-like editing, drab costumes that don't fit the setting, continuity errors galore (more than anybody can count), afterthought-like visual effects, lighting completely lacking in atmosphere, those can all be found. The music sounds cheap and is never dynamic with anything on screen, often working against it and like it belonged in another film entirely.\n\nWriting is horrendously stilted and cheesy, enough to make one want to vomit and the unintentional camp later on becomes exhausting. The action has no momentum or excitement whatsoever, is chaotically edited, under-rehearsed choreographically and a lot of it is incomprehensible. It really takes ineptitude to a whole new level. As is the story, it never comes to life and is not easy to follow often. Boll's direction is typically non-existent and cold, comparing him to Ed Wood is rather insulting when although Wood's films were the complete opposite of fine heart one could see that he had his heart in the right place (something that has never been the case with Boll). The characters are walking cliches that are neither interesting or worth rooting for, instead bland and irritating.\n\nYou know something is wrong when the best performance comes from an angry-looking Michelle Rodriguez. Elsewhere there is an emotionless lead, Meat Loaf's uncomfortable cameo and Michael Madsen and Billy Zane going through the motions. Worst of it is Kingsley in his worst ever performance, taking hamminess and chewing-scenery-to-pieces to mind-boggling extremes.\n\nSummarising, completely bloodless and appallingly awful. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

While the movie is far from perfect in every conceivable way (casting, acting, direction, camwera work, score, story, editing), it certainly isn't boring - and will appeal to people who like not-so-subtle historic action/horror movies with a high body count and gratuitous gore effects (to see the latter, you must seek out the uncut version, which runs 98 minutes). Set in no specific place or era (but most 18th/19th century Transsylvania), the story, though nonsensical, proceeds at a fast clip. And, of course, there's a little nudity and simulated sex - Kristanna Loken is quite the looker, actually. Michael Madsen was drunk during the entire shoot (you can find some entertaining clips on YT where Uwe Boll elaborates on this), and in one scene at a campfire, you can actually see him stumble and fall outside the frame. Ben Kingsley, in his few, brief scenes, delivers a non-performance, but Marvin Aday (aka Meat Loaf) is entertainingly over the top in his brief role as a vampire surrounded by (actual!) prostitutes. The special effects are a mixed bag and range from okay to terrible, but amusingly so. So, set your expectations low and you can actually enjoy this lowbrow genre movie quite a bit. I know I have.",

He has assembled a fairly impressive cast, some of the scenery is quite beautiful and the special effects are alarmingly impressive. The blood flows like wine, and the vampire effects are decent for a film of this budget.\n\nUnfortunately, that is all of the praise this is going to get from me. The cast is wasted and let down by a ridiculous script, most notably Ben Kingsley in the role of the lead bloodsucker. A paycheck is a paycheck, but you have to believe that the one he got for this dud wasn't big enough to tarnish his esteemed career. Kristanna Loken isn't much of an actress, but she is very sexy and you want to see her do better for herself than this.\n\nThe movie fails at the script level, as the story is dull and routine, and the dialogue is even worse. It's wretched, and none of it is convincingly Eighteenth century, where this allegedly takes place. But the biggest downfall here is Boll himself. As is the case with most of his films, he is his biggest enemy, as he seems to take pride in his well-earned reputation as one of the worst filmmakers working today.\n\n\"Bloodrayne\" had more potential than most of his films, but that potential only takes it so far.

Uwe Boll directs the actors to attempt to let the story flow naturally and say their lines in the most bare basic manner possible, making them give nothing to the film but their reputations and physical statured. The plot is uninspired and bare basic with the confusion coming from the fact that the dynamics occur in so many places at so many times with unbalanced pacing that keeping up with them loses its worthiness. And the setting becomes dull and dreary, a world supposedly full of vampires in a manner not believable as it coincidentally occurs to all the main characters yet not to what the camera does it identify. Basically, the setting is weak, and the characters are all in dull costumes with obvious wigs.\nBut the lack of inspiration in the action is the main problem. The action seems too improvised, and clearly had to be performed by the actors who in fear of getting injured have moved slowly and softly, resulting in things being weak and not convincingly harmful as actions of violence. The editing was also a little fast, although no worse than all the crappy action films today like Taken 2 or A Good Day to Die Hard. Still, it could have been better, and could have done without the poor quality slow motion used in half of the most important parts.\nPlus, the script and plot dynamics are a boring a dreary bunch with minimal creativity or originality, or even so much as the mind it a 3-year old's efforts put into it. It leaves little for the actors to work with, but they supply little themselves do it doesn't even matter, which is a shame considering the efforts of Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez and Academy Award winner Ben Kingsley at some of their worst. They put the physicality into their roles, but no heart of an actor. Plus, Kristanna Loken makes a bland lead as an actress who can work the physicality and show off her breasts without so much as a thought as to what her character might be thinking as something happens in the head of Rayne as she seeks vengeance for the \"rape\" and murder of her mother. She just becomes a hollow shell of a Uma Thurman wannabe who fails spectacularly.\nBasically, Uwe Boll was given the budget for Bloodrayne but refused to give in enough effort to bring the $25 million into creating an atmosphere that Bloodrayne could work with, and although it seems like one of his finer works, that in itself is not a credential.",

Sorry Uwe, but I speak truth.",

I'd rather watch Blade Trinity for goodness sake and that was a disgrace to Snipes/Blade/Vampire films altogether.  In the end I only saw about an hour of this after turning it off, but I highly doubt it had any chance of being salvaged and I could care less what happened in the terribly uninteresting and weak plot.",
