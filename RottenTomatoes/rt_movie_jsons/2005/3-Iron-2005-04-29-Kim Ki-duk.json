    "summary": "Tae-suk (Jae-hee) is a lonely drifter who spends his nights in one empty vacation home after another. However, Tae-suk is not your usual squatter, as the courteous young man always makes sure to show his absent -- and unknowing -- hosts his gratitude by doing small household tasks or making simple improvements before moving on. One day, Tae-suk mistakes a quiet home for an empty one and stumbles across an abused housewife (Seung-Yun Lee) in urgent need of his intervention.",

            "content": "Jae Hee plays as the golfing version of Hawkeye in an ethereal love story that develops the relationship between Lee Seung-yeon's Sun-hwa and Jae Hee's Tae-suk in complete defiance of social standards before taking their connection into something even further beyond - an unexplained transcendence when the rules of society prevent them from being together. They communicate almost wordlessly, seemingly drawn together by a shared disaffection with the world around them, compensating by entering other people's homes and taking care of small chores, like a pair of angels or fairytale spirits. They seemingly have found a way to exist above the brief, confusing, and pointless trappings of modern life as they touch on mortality, wealth, personal satisfaction, and romance in equal measure. It's original, entertaining, and oddly compelling. Always love a film that can combine a slow pace with a short runtime, as long as the plot doesn't suffer.\n\nWhy the 3-Iron specifically? I'm sure there is some thematic justification that you could craft regarding how that club delivers the straightest, most direct shot, but I think in reality Kim Ki-duk just wanted a way to make a shot through a car windshield seem as realistic as possible. Can't pull that off with a sand wedge. (4/5)",

            "content": "Kim Ki-Duk's 3-Iron breaches the rules of movie rationality and transports the spectator into a world of semi-reality, where nothing seems to be a reliable version of real existence.\nTae-Suk is a Lone Ranger sticking leaflets on apartments' doors only to figure out which ones are left hung, eventually breaking into the empty homes just to spend a day living the owners' life. It does not take long until he meets Sun-Hwa, an abused woman whom he surprisingly finds at home during one of his break-ins. Led by the desire to escape from her reality of domestic violence, she follows Tae-Suk in living an itinerant life, spending days in empty apartments as a real couple with the absent certainty a roof over their heads. Her violent husband, though, won't easily give up on her and will make sure Tae-Suk will do his (deserved?) time in jail with the help of a corrupt officer. It won't take long until Tae-Suk is released from prison, with Sun-Hwa waiting for him to return and who now masters the art of hiding to return to her without being seen from her husband.\nThe ending wipes away the certainty of taking for granted the finale of the movie, questioning whether what we are seeing is real or just an imagination of her lover coming back home. A silent yet attractive romance, 3-Iron draws a line between what we perceive to be real and what it really isn't, ultimately questioning whether reality itself is just a product of our imagination to distract ourselves from any hopeless existence of a vanished happiness.",

This korean production will silently involve you - provided you do have a taste for this type of movie, otherwise you'll be catching zzzs in no more than 15 minutes - and your ears hooked to the sizzlings, and bubblings and beepings and footsteps and chuckles. Almost no verbal sounds for the first half of the movie.\n\nHowever, along with this already unusual set, comes an interesting love story. The main character, Tae-suk, puts up flyers from a restaurant on people's doors, and if it's still there after a few days, that means they're still out, maybe on vacation, and that's when he breaks into their house. He won't steal a single penny, however, but he will walk around and do laundry, cook, sleep in their beds, fix their broken appliances and basically live their lives.\n\nOne time, in one of the house he breaks in - a luxurious one -, he unexpectedly stumbles upon one of the house occupants, one young lady (Sun-hwa), after she watched him go about his house chores for a while. When her husband gets home, main character watches how the husband beats and mistreats her, taking all his frustration and stress from his businessman life out on her. \n\nWhen time is right, they run away from the house, and then she tags along, helping out the home-trespasser clean houses, do laundry, sleep in people's beds, and they go as far as burying a corpse they find in an apartment they break in - which will get them in trouble later on. Tae-suk goes go jail and even after being proven innocent, Sun-hwa's husband bribes the officer into making it difficult for Tae-suk to be freed. He finally gets out one day, and heads to Sun-hwa's house, for her surprise. Feeling defeated and oppressed by how he stands no chance against the power of the rich man, he then decides to stay right there in the house with her, but always hiding and behind Sun-hwa's husband's back, kissing her and eating their food, almost like he is invisible, in a 3-person relationship.\n\n",

It is more like a dance, a ballet - something you watch for its graceful movements, the lightness of the tiptoed steps and the firmness of the stomps. Thought of as a dance, this film is a light, whimsy and spontaneous kind.\n\nBut normally we appreciate the grace of the movements in a dance in large part because we appreciate the ability of the performer to produce those movements in such a precise, delightful manner. In the case of this movie, however, it's not clear who the performer is supposed to be. Is it the main characters, or is it the film itself (i.e. the camera work)? (Perhaps both?) In any case, neither impresses me very much.\n\nIn summary, if you want to see a film that is like a ballet, there's a chance you might like this film. But if you, like me, are more interested in the content, the story, the ideas, than the presentation, you won't like it.",

            "content": "3-Iron is an unusual and beautiful love story. Even by the standards of an unusual director, 3-Iron is still a particularly odd entry in his filmography. But, like his other films I've seen, 3-Iron is still an incredible achievement that has a profound effect, despite its quiet demeanor and seemingly simplistic premise.\n\nThe plot focuses on a man named Tae-suk, who breaks into people's home to stay for the night, rather than to steal stuff. Not only does he stay in these homes, but if he finds something broken, he will also fix it as a thank you to his unknowing innkeepers.\n\nOne day, he breaks into a mansion which he believes to be empty, but it turns out not to be empty. As he goes about his routine, he is watched by a woman named Sun-hwa, a battered wife trapped in a horrible marriage who is harassed by her husband over phone messages.\n\nOnce Tae-suk realizes he is not home alone, he pretends to leave the home, but in reality hides in the backyard, waiting for Sun-hwa's abusive husband to come home. When he does, and he immediately begins abusing his wife, Tae-suk attacks him by hitting golf balls at him with a golf club.\n\nWhen he leaves, Sun-hwa decides to join him despite knowing nothing about him and participates and immerses herself in his bizarre routines of breaking into homes and fixing items. Despite some minor scrapes with the occupants of an apartment, things seem to go okay for a little while until they break into the apartment of a dead man.\n\nUpon finding the dead man, the couple buries him, but since the dead man's relatives haven't heard from him for days, two relatives stop by the apartment and call the police on the couple, and they are arrested on suspicion of murder. Sun-hwa is sent back to her husband, but Tae-suk is held in custody for burglary and other charges (After it is determined the dead man wasn't murdered, but died of lung cancer), and with the money funded by Sun-hwa's husband, the authorities keep Tae-suk behind bars.\n\nDespite imprisonment, Tae-suk attempts to find a way to get back to Sun-hwa, and proves that sometimes, not even in the walls of a prison can keep people apart.\n\nThe story is very interesting, and as this is a Kim Ki-Duk film, it is deceptively simple on the surface, but offers a great deal more to the viewer should they choose to explore it, including the mysterious elements that accompany his films. The characters, while they rarely speak to one another, feel richly developed and intriguing, despite the viewers knowing so little about them. The story was always fascinating, no matter where it went, and it's easily among the best romance films I've ever seen because of its compelling story and more.\n\nThe acting is also pretty damn good, especially as the actors are mostly forced to rely on expressions and actions, rather than dialogue. This is another usual trademark of the director, and once again, he gets the actors to pull off a feat that many directors would never be able to get the actors to do. Even in silence, the actors pull off amazing and compelling performances that made it difficult to look away from the screen.\n\n3-Iron is a film well worth watching if you love a good romance film  or a good unusual film. It's certainly unlike anything you'll ever see, and it pulls off its quirky premise with ease. It's a strange, compelling, and engaging romance film, and yet another triumph for Kim Ki-Duk.",

At the same time, Kim takes some screen time to criticize how the Far Eastern population have lost their ability to connect with people and where they come from. Strongly recommended.",

El guión de esta película es muy original, las actuaciones, como siempre en los filmes de este director, aportan ese toque diferente a la representación convencional, pues los personajes creados por Kim Ki Duk siempre van mas allá, lejos del lugar común y mas apegados al detalle, al movimiento, al sonido, etc. Un filme alejado del efectismo y con una buena dosis de simplicidad, pocos diálogos y un argumento muy inteligente (Un joven, Tae-suk (interpretado por Hyun-kyoon Lee) se cuela en casas cuando sus dueños no están, se toma fotos, lava la ropa de los moradores, arregla lo que encuentra dañado, se echa una siesta y luego se va, sin robarse nada, sin decir nada. En una de esas casas encuentra a una mujer, Sun-hwa (interpretada por Seung-yeon Lee) que luego de ver lo que hace Tae-suk, decide acompañarlo) Muy buena!",

It's also a testament to Ki-duk's direction, which was much like his work in ''Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring'': fabulous. You really have to admire his subtlety of moving the camera, how he shows us the tiniest of details, how he creates the most breathtaking of shots (like that kiss at the end). The score matches it for excellence. I was loving where the film was taking me, but where it finally ended up left me (kinda) bewildered. I'm not going to say it was awful, but a repeat viewing is definitely in order here for that (disjointed?) third act. All in all, it's a beautiful piece of work that deserves a lot more attention from movie geeks.",

Vers la fin, on tombe également dans le burlesque et dans la fiction, et ça contribue un peu à défaire le réalisme que Kim Ki-duk.\n\nBref, selon moi, 3 Iron est peut-être davantage un long court-métrage, plutôt qu'un long-métrage court. Les idées sont incroyablement intéressantes, mais tiendraient probablement davantage mieux dans une réalisation bien plus courte, dans laquelle la première moitié aurait été concisée, question de lui faire suivre le rythme de la deuxième.

            "content": "Korean Cinema, or K-movies as they are called today, have gained much attention by many moviegoers and filmmakers.  Asian films are known for their distinctive styles, dynamics in character development, great cinematography, and are most effective in engulfing the audience with their use of silent moments.  Director Kim Ki-Duk is one of those directors that are most inspired in combining these styles to make very inspired motion pictures.  3-Iron is one of his films that reflect his true style through a difference in storytelling.\n\n     A benevolent vagabond, Tae-suk wonders the streets of Seoul.  He burglarizes the homes of vacationing families, but never resorts to anything immoral in the process.  He dwells within these homes and fixes broken appliances, cleans laundry, and tidies up the place.  His act later leads him to the home of a rich, yet abusive husband, Lee Min-kyu.  While doing what he does, Tae-suk comes into contact with the estranged wife, Sun-hwa.  Saving her from the confines of her ill-tempered husband, they drift off into hiding and they both begin to discover feelings of affection.  As their feelings for one another start to develop their actions start to lead them in trouble, but the optimistically clever Tae-suk evades his hindrances from Sun-hwa.\n\n     Out of a lot of movies I've seen where relationships are developed through criminal acts, 3-Iron is a new and different take on that style of character development.  Like most of Kim's better-known blockbusters, the two main characters never or hardly ever speak and are expressed through movement.  Kim's style encompasses art and feeling.  Any director who relies less on dialogue and more on visuals to convey a particular atmosphere are very talented.\n\n     Kim Ki-Duk has admitted that his overall style is meant to show the viewer humanities' true nature of malevolence.  Most of the story to 3-Iron feels very folklore inspired.  Almost like the more active, yet silent characters are the voices of reason in a world where words tend to create mystery and confusion.  Only those who are silent can be trusted.\n\n     3-Iron is more like one of the alter egos of Kim Ki-Duk's more famous movies.  He's mostly been well known for his more isolated settings and wide shots of scenery.  Other movies he's made in more populated settings include Bad Guy, Samaritan Girl, and Time.  Each goes for their own theme and engulfs the audience in different ways using different dynamics.\n\n     3-Iron uses music and folklore like narrative to give the audience a sense of conflict as to what kind of world we live in.  From the way I described the plot, it sounds as if 3-Iron is a love story.  It's much more than that.  It is more about trying to deal with circumstances and trying to overcome one's fears in the process.  Another thing it deals with is trying to be the figure of responsibility in a world where everything feels chaotic and sardonic.\n\n     3-Iron is a great film that may not be as great as Kim Ki-Duk's early works, but is one that should be shared and treasured for K-movie fans.  Films of this nature are as wonderfully engulfing as looking at a series of connected paintings.  Love him or hate him, Kim Ki-Duk is a director of classic cinema that is less about script and more about art to tell an effective story.",
