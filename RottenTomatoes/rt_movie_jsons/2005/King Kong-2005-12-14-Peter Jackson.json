    "summary": "Peter Jackson's expansive remake of the 1933 classic follows director Carl Denham (Jack Black) and his crew on a journey from New York City to the ominous Skull Island to film a new movie. Accompanying him are playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) and actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), who is whisked away by the monstrous ape, Kong, after they reach the island. The crew encounters dinosaurs and other creatures as they race to rescue Ann, while the actress forms a bond with her simian captor.",

            "content": "Let me start by saying that this film is a true spectacle of special effects and action sequences. The CGI is outstanding, with King Kong himself being brought to life in a stunning and believable manner. The battles between Kong and the various creatures on Skull Island are nothing short of epic, and the final showdown in New York City is a sight to behold.\n\nThe plot follows filmmaker Carl Denham, played by Jack Black, who sets out on an expedition to the mysterious Skull Island to shoot his latest movie. Along the way, he meets Ann Darrow, played by Naomi Watts, who becomes the object of Kong's affection. The relationship between Ann and Kong is one of the film's strongest points, with their bond being both touching and tragic. The performances of the cast are also noteworthy. Jack Black delivers a solid performance as the ambitious and selfish Carl Denham, while Naomi Watts shines as the vulnerable and compassionate Ann Darrow. The supporting cast, which includes Adrien Brody and Colin Hanks, also delivers strong performances.\n\nOne criticism that could be leveled at the film is its length. At over three hours, it does feel a bit bloated at times, with some scenes feeling unnecessary or drawn-out. However, this is a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things.\n\nOverall, King Kong is a thrilling and emotionally-charged adventure that is sure to entertain. The special effects are top-notch, the performances are strong, and the story is engaging. If you're a fan of action-adventure movies, then this one is definitely worth watching.",

The cinematography is good as well with lots of creative shts that have great action and epic scope to them. The only problem is the CGI at times especially during the stampede looks awful though Kong himself is amazing to look at. Great music but not exactly catchy or memorable. The editing and pacing are good but this shouldn't have been 3 hours. Things do drag in the middle hunting for Ann as this doesn't have the frantic pacing of the original and takes its time setting up the next encounter which has mixed results. Though the T-Rex Fight was awesome. This film does a better job in the first half building characters and going into more detail from start to getting to Skull Island. The finale is good also especially the stampede which is well done despite oversaturation of CG at times. Definitely give this a watch if your a fan of Jackson, any of the actors in this, Adventure or Monster Films. It's a Great Time and worth the 3 hour watch at least once.",

            "content": "Beautiful\nI wrote this opening day, and now would like to include it here at IMDb..\n\nKing Kong: a remake, action, drama, thriller, comedy, epic 3 hour film. Only Peter Jackson could hold an audience's attention for 3 whole hours. The communication between Kong and Ann is very cool and funny. Naomi Watts is great in this, but the real star is KING KONG!! His realistic movement and expression is amazing. The effects are great! Best I've seen... ever. You can surely tell that Peter Jackson was the director just by the way he films and shows the landscape. He gives us an amazing visual experience that only he could accomplish.\n\nI saw the advanced screening of this and it wore me out. The first part has Jack Black's character Carl Denham, Naomi Watts as Ann Darow and Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll. They are all hurried by Carl to Skull Island on a ship. They eventually arrive at Skull Island in a storm. Literally. They crash into some rocks in arrival and there are wave effects which blew my mind.\n\nThe make up of the islanders is hideous but very neat and gets the audiences' attention. Ann is taken captive by the natives in a very dark and exciting way but not so much memorable since it is outdone by the next 2 hours. She is lowered to the ground in a way that will amaze you. Kong shows up and is attracted to Ann. This relationship between human and creature has never been done on such a level.The part where Kong fights the crew on the large log is classic. The capture of King Kong is incredibly better than I expected and my expectations are always high in movies. There are some emotional moments for Ann here as she is in love with both guys who saved her life.\n\nRampaging around New York lifting cars, buses, and women who look like Naomi Watts but never finding her, pure movie magic. This is the kind of film that comes only once every few years. The finale scene atop the Empire State building is just grand.\n\nOverall, King Kong is for sure the best movie this year. Each action scene out does the one prior. The characters are emotionally convincing. The ending is sad even though it has been done time and time again. The action has never been done on this level. The Lord of the Rings is just as great a movie, but isn't at all like King Kong. They are entirely different. Compared to the 1933 version, King Kong is faithful in plot. Many of the lines stay the same also. King Kong will be adored by audiences there will be applause. Best Movie!! Must See!! I laughed, cried, stunned.........\n\nAlso can't wait for the extended version. Maybe there will be a few parts included that were in the 1933 original.",

The movie has wonderful effects, bringing to life the ancient world of Skull Island. A team of production and art designers, set dressers, and top-drawer visual effects artists do a stellar job of immersing us in this swampy, primordial, and prehistoric island. Jackson turned to his motion-capture muse Andy Serkis (Gollum from the 'LOTR' films) to play and act out a digital Kong. Amazingly, they make us empathize and care for the beast. The cast does a sturdy job of carrying this epic-length (3-plus hours) theme park ride of a film, from its convincingly re-created Depression-era opening, through it's Skull Island middle acts, to its touching Empire State finale. But \"theme park ride\" doesn't have to be a bad label for a movie to wear.

It is a Hollywood blockbuster about a madman who relentlessly chases down a Hollywood blockbuster.  Mystery for the price of admission and killing the thing you love are two quotes, main themes.  While we are lapping up the spectacle the spectacle is being deconstructed as a farce and a tragedy.  It is also about how we use movies to address those things that are too big in our lives, that are beyond our control, that is, the power and mystery of our reality and try to make it digestible, into something we can watch and not have to close our eyes.  If one person can see what no one else sees, if one person is relentless enough, if one person realizes before its too late...we can all put ourselves into one of these roles and feel chastised or cleansed by it.  And the adreneline that this movie slowly builds up to is the perfect sort of vehicle to suck you in, to stop your thinking/justification and just feel.

Many complained of the first hour or so being too slow, but I didn't find that. The stunning cinematography actually more than compensated, and throughout the movie Naomi Watts is a delight as Ann Darrow. Jack Black was an admittedly odd choice as Carl Denham but he still manages a worthwhile performance. Although Kong doesn't appear until an hour and a quarter into the movie, he was flawlessly designed, and credit also must go to Andy Serkis for performing him, as he did a fantastic job. In fact, the only weak performance comes from Adrien Brody, his performance was a little too wimpy for my liking. The film is superbly designed, with the amount of detail evident, and the direction from Peter Jackson was excellent. However, I was disturbed by a number of scenes, like any part with the aborigines, and when that flower thing sucked that man's face. My other criticism of the movie, was that although the scenes with Ann and Kong were well handled on the most part, I found the ice skating bit a bit too slushy and unconvincing. Despite the flaws King Kong may have, it was still a very good film, that I will happily award a 7/10. Bethany Cox",

It does feature some moments of genuine mood and some decent spectacle, and Naomi Watts was fantastic in a dual comedic and dramatic role.  But this movie is just so drawn out and padded out to extreme degrees with material that is ultimately meaningless.  Heck, I'd just out-and-out call the first hour of the movie outright bad - almost outright terrible.  It would've been cool if this movie was a reimagining of the original Kong story, giving it a reason to be over 3 hours long, but this is literally just a beat-for-beat retelling, just with double the runtime.  This movie also makes the same mistake that all other King Kong movies make, however, and that is to try to make us feel immense sorrow for this giant murderous beast right after going on a massive killing spree.  While I was more sympathetic toward this Kong than I was to the one from the original, I still wasn't sad when he ultimately met his end, as he was, even before being kidnapped, an extremely volatile creature.  If you're interested in seeing it I suppose you could, but honestly I saw it once and I am good; it was drab, lifeless and felt like it would never end.",

I jest about the the running time of TLOTR:ROTK but in reality, I wouldn't  have it a second shorter, even in its extended version. The trilogy changed the face of cinema, and Jackson soon announced his next project would be a(nother) remake of King Kong, and it would breach the 3 hour barrier, as is Jackson's wont. Seeing this in a battered old cinema, in a small town in Wicklow, Ireland at Christmas in 2005, where the heating failed during the intermission, I completely fell in love with King Kong. Watching 15 years on, I was staggered at how good it still looks, the visuals are absolutely remarkable. Jackson's storytelling thrust amongst a dazzling world he creates before your very eyes, transports you to a place where you really believe in the characters, and don't look at your watch once, hell, I forgot I was wearing one. I'm sure another remake won't be to everyones taste, but i had to flag this up because I was blown away at how much I loved this, and how impressive it was on 3rd viewing.",

            "content": "King Kong - 10/10. Peter Jackson was riding high from the massive success of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, with The Return Of The King earning a record tying 11 Academy Awards. With all that success, Jackson earned Carte blanche status, given the ability to finally go ahead with his passion project, a remake of King Kong. Been in development since the 90s, Jackson had been trying for years to get the project up and running, only to finally have the power to do so. The film ended up in theaters for christmas 2005, with it earning decent box office returns and high acclaim. But it didn't end up achieving LOTR type success, which has sadly caused this movie to be underrated. With time passing by however, the film has achieved a fairly good cult following, and in comparison to the uninspired Kong Skull Island, many fans have had a reignited love for this adaptation. Kong saw some fairly unique casting choices, which surprisingly worked. Naomi Watts did an exceptional job as the lead character, Jack Black really surprises as the money/fame driven director, and Andy Serkis works his magic as the motion capture stand in for the beast. What Jackson does so amazingly well in this film is his eye for visuals and method of story telling. The run time of 3+ hours flies by when watching the movie. It such a fun film, and one that goes at a perfect pace. The journey to Skull Island, the action set pieces on the island, the incredible reimagined NYC sequences towards the fatale end, give this film such an amazing viewing experience. It's one of those rare instances where the remake might be better than the original. It's blasphemous to say, since the original Kong is a classic, but there's a lot of heart and soul in this film. We see Jackson deliver so much in all fronts, that it feels extremely personal, even when you consider that the film when boiled down is just a monster movie. It was one of my favourite films growing up, and I'm glad its starting to gain more respect and praise over the years. It's probably one of the last solo epics we will ever see, considering that many films nowadays are designed to have sequels.",

            "content": "A Monumental Success of a Movie\nIf it had been announced that a remake of the classic \"King Kong\" was being made without the name Peter Jackson attached to it, there is no doubt audiences would have been outraged. But after the enormous success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it would seem that the general public has learned to trust director Peter Jackson. After watching his remake of King Kong, I would have to say that their trust was well placed.\n\nJackson now firmly cements his name as a master filmmaker, the kind that all aspiring directors want to be. The attention he pays to the most minute details, the sheer class he shows in terms of production and scale, the amount of skill he has in manipulating our fragile emotions... the man is clearly one of the most talented directors in film history. And Jackson certainly brings his considerable skill and flair to show here in 'Kong'. While a different director likely would have sped up the story to the crew's arrival on Skull Island, Jackson takes his time with a nice, leisurely build up to their arrival, giving us lots of time to really get to know these characters, and also providing time for a slow and genuine romance building between the characters of Anne and Jack. This romance does lead to the very few and seldom weaknesses of the film... the romance scenes can seem a bit cheesy and contrived at times. But when that's literally the only complain I can make, it's a pretty damn good sign for the movie!\n\nThe visual effects are an essential part of the movie, and they really needed to be done well here to properly sell the idea - safe to say that they were still good enough to surpass my already unrealistically high expectations! Safe to say, even in today's computer saturated film industry the special effects in King Kong will still succeed in blowing you away. And Jackson seems to have an almost uncanny skill in manipulating his audience's emotions - you will cheer, you will laugh, you will cry, you will really be on the edge of your seat and you will be truly and thoroughly disgusted in at least one part of the movie - watch out for a cave full of giant insects on Skull Island. It seemed only fair to post a warning considering how profoundly well done it is...\n\nThe cast is pitch perfect, right down to the most minuscule parts. (the natives on Skull Island are even more terrifying than any orcs or evil creatures in LOTR) Naomi Watts gives a heartwarming and wonderful performance as the innocent Ann Darrow, the \"beauty who killed the beast\". And indeed, performance aside, Watts hasn't looked this beautiful for quite a while! While everyone had their doubts about Jack Black's casting a while back, he proves to be just what his character needed to be truly believable. Black harnesses his trademark manic energy, and instead of playing it for laughs, expels it through Carl Denham's passion for the film industry, and his lust for providing a show for his audiences - sometimes at the cost of his morals. I must admit, I have never been a fan of Adrien Brody, but even he managed to win my sympathies, and proves surprisingly convincing as heroic screenwriter Jack Driscoll. And then there's Andy Serkis... the man is so underrated, since his best performances have been overshadowed by masks of admittably impressive CGI, but result in him losing credit he so desperately deserves. Serkis, while utterly convincing as an enormous silverback gorilla in terms of movement and vocalizations, still manages to bring a surprising humanity to Kong. I'm hard pressed to remember the last time an animal protagonist has managed to capture our hearts and emotional involvement as much as Kong does, and Serkis definitely deserves accolades for re-creating such an iconic character in a beautiful fashion only through movement and body language. He also takes a hilarious supporting role as the grizzled and trigger-happy Lumpy the cook.\n\nOverall, I think it is safe to say that King Kong succeeds on a level completely lost to most productions these days. Rarely are our emotions manipulated with such ease, rarely do we find ourselves getting so engrossed in a story that a 3 hour running time seems to have gone by far too quickly and we yearn for more. King Kong is an odyssey of a movie, and the most genuine and compelling output seen since... well, the Lord of the Rings. This is classic storytelling at its peak - don't miss out on it!\n\n-10/10",

Like, lady, I dunno, but the hairy killing-machine just iced a bunch of your friends, why are you still being affectionate with it? That didn't add a lot of entertainment or make much sense.

            "content": "An entertaining adventure epic with some glaring issues.\n\nPeter Jackson's monster horror adventure King Kong (2005) is a striking reimaging of the old 1933 classic horror picture of the same name. Jackson had just finished directing The Lord of the Rings Trilogy of fantasy films, so I guess he wanted to make one more massive epic for audiences to enjoy. The problem is he crammed so many ideas into 3 hours, that you get disengaged after awhile and King Kong certainly feels the length. Did this need to be 187 minutes for this story? Honestly no and Jamie Selkirk had to cut a lot I'm sure, but what we got was just too much to sit through for how uninteresting the drama is with scarce action.\n\nJackson's direction is ambitious in scale and scope with a clear vision, but it gets muddled by bad jokes, corny melodramatic dialogue, racist tropes, and the same story that we already know regardless of some changes here. Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens' script is intriguing, yet bare bones in character development as everything serves to develop Kong's character, which leaves all the humans as one note caricatures.\n\nAndrew Lesnie's cinematography has many beautiful shots, especially all of his close-up shots on Naomi Watts, who is incredible here as Ann Darrow. Her sympathetic role is full of teary eyed looks and blood curdling screams. The CGI for Kong is excellent with many realistic shots that may trick you into thinking the giant lovable gorilla is real; however, some of the green screen backgrounds look super fake and are distracting upon revisiting King Kong.\n\nGrant Major's production design is lavish with period accurate sets all over King Kong. James Newton Howard's score is chilling and exciting as he delivers an understated score for Peter Jackson's frightening scenes. Jackson's erratic direction does feature his signature slow down shots with the camera phasing in and out as well as his ultra wide shots that are quite stunning. I like Terry Ryan, Carolyn M. Fenton, and Simon Ward's costumes too.\n\nJack Black steals the show as the villainous director Carl Denham. His display of obsession and greed are captivating, much like Naomi Watts' lovely performance as a portrayal of empathy. Adrien Brody is gripping as the genuine playwright Jack Driscoll. Andy Serkis is fun as the cook, but deeply touching as Kong himself. His motion capture performances are legendary for a reason. Jamie Bell and Kyle Chandler are really authentic as well in their subtle roles. Colin Hanks is just alright as Preston, although he gets the point across about Jack Black's exponentially corruptive presence and actions.\n\nIn all, Peter Jackson did his best with this mighty movie, but there are strange tonal shifts from human sacrifice to Kong skating on ice.",

Action-adventure lovers have the dino-rampage, featuring raptors chasing down a pack of brontosaurs; the triple T-Rex smackdown (a tour de force that lasts about 10 minutes); an insect attack that will make bug-phobes squirm (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is tame by comparison); Kong's attempts to reclaim his stolen bride; and the final Empire State Building battle.

A decade-and-a-half after its release, the special effects may have dimmed somewhat and don't feel half as revolutionary as the rudimentary techniques of the 1933 original, which leaves me wishing that the filmmakers had spent a little more on hiring an editor rather than just one more animator.",

Skull Island has a full eco system and is a character unto itself. The period detailing in New York is staggering. You'll forget (or completely miss) that it's all on a soundstage. The action sequences are beautifully coherent and filled with eye candy. Peter Jackson continuously uping the ante, his love for the original showing in every frame which pops with lavishly saturated primary hues for a beautifully filmic look. Topped with an exhilarating, romantic score and a leading lady who gets more to do than just scream (Ann Darrow's emotional investment is what helps us invest emotionally in the finale) fleshing out the character into a leading lady we can care about while each of the other character's get their own time to shine and convince us of each of their own motivations. \n\nThen we get to Kong himself! Finally!! Andy Serkis' mo-cap performance and Weta's Digitial artistry combined have rendered our first living breathing Kong even 12 years on he still looks impressive and convincing in a range of emotions. To be sure it's a long film and the Extended Edition a VERY long film but it's time well spent. One of the most rewarding cinematic experiences to date.

This movie is too long. It takes forever for an action scene to happen and takes forever for King Kong to show up. It took like an hour and a half for the human characters to show up to Skull Island. The forced 'romance' between King Kong and Naomi Watts' character was weird, annoying, completely unnecessary, and dragged on for too long. Why did Peter Jackson make King Kong a giant gorilla instead of a giant sasquatch like he was in the original? The CGI for King Kong even looks pretty dated and hasn't aged that well. All of the human characters were boring, forgettable, unlikable, and uninteresting. The ending was so horrible. The ending really sucked. I absolutely hated the ending. I once even fell asleep during the movie cause it was so damn boring. I don't know why a lot of people like this movie. Highly overrated film. I did not like it and I still do not like it. The saddest thing is...that this was the first King Kong movie I ever watched and I never knew there were any other King Kong movies before it. I used to think this was the original one. I was only 9 years old when I first watched this film. I hated it back then and I still hate it to this day. Thank god for the 2017 reboot!

I was blown away by the T-Rex VS Kong battle, the Dino stampede and some of the earlier rather creepy scenes. But it is the scenes between Ann Darrow and Kong that touch you the most and a particular one in central park in the snow is a highlight. This is a must watch, a surefire classic of the future.

For example, the \"crossing the threshold\" step, Naomi Watts LITTERALLY crosses the threshold between the dock and the boat.

She and Kong had great chemistry and throughout the movie she did a great job of making the audience feel what she was feeling. I honestly thought this was an academy award worth film with state of the art  cgi which holds up still in 2019. \n\nSo many times we see film makers take liberties with characters that they know nothing about such as the Russo Brothers with the Hulk, but not Peter Jackson.

While I was a bit restless when waiting to see the titular giant gorilla, when he makes his first appearance, the film remains an entertaining epic throughout. To hell with Kong: Skull Island, this is the real modern Kong flick. The special effects are amazing, even by 2005 standards. Andy Serkis pulls off another breathtaking motion-capture performance as the gorilla whom we nowadays consider to be Harambe's cousin. Serkis also plays a live-action character, and it helped keep me sane during the first hour of the movie, since Kong already appeared in the movie in a way. If only human Serkis and giant gorilla Serkis were in the same scene together for 2 or 3 minutes. It'd be like seeing double. I would've killed to see that. The performances are great. I don't know why people say that they find it weird to see Jack Black in a serious role. I think he does a terrific job. People love it when comedians do serious roles. Like Adam Sandler in Punch-Drunk Love or Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody do great jobs of portraying Ann Darrow and Jack Driscoll, respectively as well and seem to have great romantic chemistry during the first hour of this movie which is basically a drama set on a ship being sailed by Fegelein, if you know what I mean. Some of the slow-motion feels unnecessary. It made me think \"No wonder the movie's three hours long\".  The action sequences are amazing. Seeing Kong fight against three T-Rexes was one of the best action scenes I have ever seen in my entire life. And given how the CGI still holds up pretty well 12 years later, that's saying a lot. I might have to disagree with what the Audience Score on this movie says. They were probably just expecting another Lord of the Rings...but with a 25-foot gorilla. Never has a bond between a gorilla and a woman been so fascinating. It also focuses a bit on the themes of what showbiz can do to a person. Because of his financial desperation, Carl Denham resorted to animal cruelty by capturing a live Kong and taking him back to America...somehow so that he can appear as part of a Broadway act. Featuring blackface actors. Historical accuracy, y'all. All I can say is that I certainly prefer this King Kong movie over Skull Island, and that it manages to deliver despite somewhat slow pacing thanks to an exhaustingly overlong runtime with Andy Serkis pulling off another mesmerizing performance before he turned into a sentient, intelligent ape and a drunken CG Scottish captain around the same time ;). You did good, Peter Jackson, you did good. Now I just need the required amount of time so that I can finally watch The Lord of the Rings trilogy along with that of The Hobbit. I'm a film junkie, deal with it.",

Jackson manages to give the titular giant ape monster both a heart and a soul by utilizing both the magic of motion capture technology and the talents of one of this century's finest actors: Andy Serkis. The soulful connection that forms between him and Naomi Watts' Ann Darrow is ultimately the beating heart of this movie. Aside from Ann and Kong's beautifully tragic relationship, the movie is fulled by heart-pounding adventure, breathtaking special effects (most of which still hold up over a decade later), and Jackson's seemingly effortless ability to create a fresh spectacle out of already groundbreaking material.

Peter Jackson I know you love showing us New York and the harbor in 1933, but a five second establishing shot is plenty. There were countless examples of WAY too long shots of mostly nothing. \nSecond negative, spend some CGI money on something other than Kong. Some of the scenes on Skull Island, specifically \"the running of the dinos\" were laughable. Really badly done. Jurassic Park had better effects and pre-dated your movie by a decade. \nThe Jack Black was awful. Across the board. I really didn't think he could be unlikable in anything. Boy was I wrong. \nFinally Jack's last line - the iconic one - didn't land at all because they spent so much time showing us that she loved Kong. She didn't kill him. She tried to save him. They should have found a way to make that line work and they didn't. \nNow the good stuff - contrary to my last point, I loved the extra attention on the relationship between beauty and the beast. I'm a softie. That really worked for me and Kong's expressiveness was tremendous. The scene on the frozen pond was pure movie magic. \nKong ripping through NY was simply amazing. As was his fight with the T-Rex pack.  \nI loved all he little touches. The credits with the same design, putting the Kong costumes from the original into the musical number in front of Kong, etc, etc.  It was very clear that Jackson has a deep and abiding love for his source material. \nIn the end, the positives far outweighed the negatives. I wouldn't say it's better than the original, but it's just as good.",

The natives of the island were not only creepy, but more interesting. Jack Black and Adrien Brody were completely miscasted, and didn't fit the time period of this film! \nAs for the effects? Some looked good, and others, not so much. It was so obvious that they were fake, including that brontosaurus stampede scene! You could tell that they used green screen, damn! But a couple scenes that I give the creators high props for, is the t-Rex fight sequence, and the giant insects at the bottom of the chasm! Those are awesome and terrifying!

Though there were some less than glorifying special effects also such as the brontosaur stampede scene. The characters had little development but were delivered as interesting still. Jack Black's money grabbing character is a great character to hate and executed well enough to elicit negative emotions towards. Overall there were spots where the movie dragged but still was able to keep me watching throughout the whole movie. It is not Jackson's best work but still can be commendable.",

I first (and last) saw it the year it hit video and I saw the last forty minutes of it again a few hours later, just to confirm for myself that I had truly wasted my time. Now I'm watching it again to verify that it's as horrible as I remember. I'll try to sell it as good as I can: here's a genuinely well thought-out attempt to bring you \"King Kong\" as if it were filmed prior to 1930 but with all the advances in \"film techniques\" that were developed since then. (There!) It's just not well executed. Included in this period-realistic criticism is that Jack Black wouldn't have been born, yet. The worst decision was to give the most profound lines, and the feature's most extrovert character (besides Kong) they were written for, to none other than Jack Black -- effectively destroying any chance of the audience taking ANY of it seriously. It's not just that Black is a comedian, it's that Black has made his career on making fun of the profound by making it seem absurd. If Jackson was hoping to seem hip with this ironic twist of casting, then what a tragic loss. Anything else I could write would be about second-worst, third-worst decisions, forever. Notably horrible: introspective, \"oh wow\" score replete with solo angelic vocal during the gratuitous bug-smashing sequence; King Kong follies on ice all weekend long; the hundred or so moments when the girl would have died while being carried by King Kong; action stopping periodically so the lead actress can do follies and juggling tricks; (ad infinitum). Some counter-points: the bug-smashing sequence seems ad-libbed, with the bugs being added later to almost comical effect; and I think at some point Jackson realized the girl was on her 90th or so life and when asking himself, \"how does she survive all this being flung around and smashed?\" came up with the idea that she's a follies girl, \"hey folks, she does this all week!\" It's stupid. It's a stupid, stupid film and after writing this I don't have any further reason to go back and watch it ever again. But that doesn't mean I have to give it a zero review. It gets half a star for some fairly interesting computer generated imagery despite some embarassing mistakes in depth perception (or do the actors sometimes seem like they're standing in front of a movie screen on purpose, to immerse us in the filmed-prior-to-1930 sensation,) half a star for some really tense moments despite an utter lack of suspense, and one star for the few brief moments that it genuinely tries to look and feel like something that was filmed during the Great Depression. I'm especially depressed that this was in a stack of really narrow-audience DVDs including \"Planet of the Apes\" that my black neighbor gave me when he was moving out, but: half a star for having a \"cult following\". 2 1/2 out of 5.",

At least for me it was.\nI'm a massive lover of the original stop-motion, brilliantly crafted 1933 King Kong, i think it's an absolute masterpiece, and too see Peter Jackson, clearly a fan too, recreate that film, with state of the art special effect to reinvigorate this story, was heartwarming for me. The movie is longer, bigger, even more interesting, and i just love everything about it, because i love the original soo much. The movie gives you more information on each character, and their backstories, as expected for a movie almost double the length of the original, which was great for a fan like me to get to know more about the characters i've grown to love.\n\nKing Kong was a total blast for me, and a heartwarming experience, seeing the awesome original stop-motion clay puppet fight between the T-Rex and King Kong, realised and beautified with pitch-perfect CGI was just one of many things i loved about King Kong.\n(The CGI of King Kong was absolutely astounding, obviously my compliments to Andy Serkis who pulls off yet another fantastic CG character performance, as he also did with The Lord of the Rings, the CGI of King Kong itself was beautiful, the rest of the movie's CGI was severely worse, especially a dinosaur stampede as the film crew has to flee out of a canyon, in that scene in particular the CGI was pretty bad.)\n\nOf course this movie lacks the beautiful simplicity and artistery the original film had, but the way PJ has done it, was truly incredible in my honest opinion\n\nI'm sorry King Kong haters, i'm completely on the other side of the spectrum on this one.",

You can't help but feel that the first and last acts have a good deal of filler material in it, but the 2nd act on Skull Island is where the film really shines. For a PG-13 film, it's brutal (many people and creatures die entertainingly  cool and intense deaths) and disgusting (lots of gross insects and creatures, and one pretty grody death). Naomi Watts makes Ann Darrow into a real character, and we believe that she actually has feelings for the big ape, Adrian Brody does a fine job as Jack Driscoll, and even Jack Black manages to impress every now and then (He doesn't convincingly sell all of his lines, but most of his reaction shots are believable and his final  classic line is delivered pretty convincingly. His character is supposed to be somewhat unlikeable but still likable enough. It's a right rope that Black walks well enough). Andy Serkis' performance as Kong is also completely believable, although I will say he acts way too human at some points. The CGI is also pretty good and believable except for a few scenes where it interacts with human characters. I will say the CGI 1930's NYC and Skull Island environments were convincingly done and both were pretty impressive. Overall, this Kong is a mixed bag. It can't match up to the original classic, there's not as many memorable moments here, I don't agree with the focus on trying to make this film a huge epic, it's way too long, and it's likely a film you won't revisit often but I still found it to be a vastly entertaining and fun ride.",

After the ill fated expedition ventures ashore, it begins to feel more like an action movie than anything else. When it is discovered that Kong is not entirely wicked, it starts to feel like a love story of sorts. \n\nThe sudden change of tone is a bit jarring. Personally, I felt that the first half was, by far, the best. However, it compensates for its narrative flaws with breathtaking visuals. The motion capture used to create Kong is particularly impressive. An ominous score by Harry Gregson Williams sets the mood of this breathtaking epic.\n\nDespite some jarring changes of tone, King Kong is a good film, and I highly encourage you to see it. (A-)",

That's right, I'm talking about the one and only \"King Kong\", or at least Peter Jackson's remake of it.\n\nOf course, over 70 years after the original was released, it is worth mentioning the advancement of technology since then.  The visual effects of \"King Kong\" are top notch.  Everything looks great: Kong, the landscapes of Skull Island, and even dinosaurs that would make \"Jurassic Park\" jealous.\n\nThe cast of \"King Kong\" is likewise fantastic, resulting in some very interesting characters.  Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow and Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll are both excellent leads, though I don't entirely buy their whirlwind romance.  Also, it's refreshing to see Jack Black in a role where he isn't making fart jokes.  But seriously, he does deliver a good performance as the sly, deceitful Carl Denham.  And of course, I have to mention the excellent motion capture work done by Andy Serkis, which brought Kong to life.\n\nThis film suffers mostly from its slow pace.  For example, it is 70 minutes into the film before Kong makes his first appearance.  While the slow pace allows for plenty of character development, it makes certain parts of the film drag on.\n\nPeter Jackson's overlong remake of this Hollywood classic is certainly a beautiful work of art, but it is a loooong 3 hours to sit through.  That said, it is well worth it because this \"King Kong\" pays great homage to the original.",

Who doesn't know the story of a group of filmmakers that travels to a mysterious island, where they come eye-to-eye with a gigantic gorilla. This is one of the remakes that dares to overpower the original one. With eye for detail, this 187 minutes adventure is brilliant in every way. The setting, the effects, the plot and the thrills and emotions are astonishingly good. In its cast we see Adrien Brody (Splice, Predators), Naomi Watts (The Impossible, Funny Games), Jack Black (School of Rock, Shallow Hal), Kyle Chandler (Super 8, The Wolf of Wall street), Jamie Bell (Billy Eliot, Nymphomaniac) and Andy Serkis (The Lord of the Rings saga, The Cottage) as Kong.\n\n1932, troublesome filmmaker Carl Denham (Black) hires poor actress Ann Darrow (Watts) to act in his new film, that will be shot on location. Ann agrees as she learns that her favorite writer Jack Driscoll (Brody) is the screenwriter. Along with film crew and actor Bruce Daxtor (Chandler), they step on board of the steamer SS Venture and leave New York. On the sea, Jack and Ann grow closer together and learn that they are sailing toward the mysterious Skull Island. \n\nDuring a storm, the vessel gets stuck between rocks and Denham orders his crew to go to shore to work on his movie. On the island they see that the island has a very large wall and meet the vicious natives, who attack them. After being rescued by captain Englehorn and his sailors, the film crew agrees to return to the ship. But then Ann is kidnapped by the natives. In a ritual ceremony she is offered to the creature behind the wall. As Jack and the others witness how a gigantic gorilla takes the blonde woman with him, Carl has an idea that could make him both rich and famous...",

It's entertaining. The action sequences are fun, and despite its long run time, the film goes by fast. It's over before you know it. What is good about King Kong is the fact it stays consistent with its fantastical nature. It's okay to be plotless, ridiculous at times, and even sometimes absurd. Just as long as its fun, pretty, has good music. As for all you fans of the original King Kong, and I am talking about the 1933 version, you'll be pleasantly surprised that it stays relatively close to its predecessor.

Denham is obsessed with finding the mysterious \"Skull Island\" and filming his movie there so he manages to hire a tramp steamer to make his obsession come true but once they find the island they discover a creature that may kill them all. \nWith Jackson at head of this film and counting with some A list actors, some of them are actors I really enjoy seeing,  expectations about making a worthy retell of the eighth wonder of the world were high but unfortunately Jackson deliver an uneven film with some memorable moments in it but also counting with serious pacing issues. The acting is functional but there isn't anyone that stands out, the action scenes are pretty but aren't engaging, bland characters with absolutely no character arc, Hollywood managed to get Kong right by having Serkis doing the motion capture, the special effects were phenomenal at the time but unfortunately now they look a little dated, the editing is a little weird and even becomes annoying at certain sections of the film, beautiful locations that are enhance by a well done cinematography and while the story is known by everyone, it still has some memorable moments worth all the waiting. The biggest problem with 2005 \"King Kong\" is Jackson\u00b4s slow pacing. Jackson give us tons of unnecessary scenes just because he wanted to make a three hour movie; some people argue that Kong is just a supporting character in his own film but I don't have a problem with the fact it takes some time to see Kong because I like some build up when is done well; that being said, Kong appears after a boring and forgettable hour of needless exposition that never goes anywhere. Another problem with the pacing is the fact the supporting characters are even more develop than the protagonists themselves and after spending two and a half hours with them, they are thrown away in the final section, so what's the point in having them? \nJackson\u00b4s version of \"King Kong\" is a beautifully shot but hollow experience that wastes its talented cast with forgettable characters and an unnecessary slow pace.",

Surprisingly, I didn't expect myself to like this movie since it's a remake of one of my favorite movies of all time. But I was super duper surprised to find out that it was all right. My main problem I had with this movie were the characters. We'll don't get me wrong the actors did great. But characters like Carl Denham and Jack Driscoll are really weird in the movie. Adrien Brody's character had this really weird accent on him like he was Jewish or something. Then Jack Black comes into the movie and he is really horrible in this. Carl Denial is an idiot to me and he just does idiotic stuff way thourghout the movie. Naomi Watts does a great job in this movie. You can see how she interacts with King Kong and she does a great job expressing her fear and likeableness to King Kong. The effects on King Kong are fantastic and are pretty to look at. Andy Serkis is always awesome and in this movie he proves himself to be one of the best actors alive. Then the other human characters in this movie are just really plain stupid morons. They just act like there the dumbest things on the earth and in the movie for that matter. There is one  scene in the movie were Jack Black and his friends are on this island and they run into dinosaurs and they try to run away from them. The effects on the dinosaurs are some of the most worst effects that I have seen in movie history. It's even worse then the deer in Tammy or Rocky and Bullwinkle In The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle back from 2000. The movie also has other redeeming qualities. Like actors like Jamie Bell and Craig Hall give good performances . Also I did laugh sometimes in this movie. Another gripe I have to address is that King Kong doesn't show up until halfway into the movie. My problem is that the movie is called King Kong but he doesn't show up for a long time until halfway into it like I said. But King Kong has so much less screen time then the other characters in the movie it just feels like they wasted the creature. But the movie isin't horrible not even close. But the limited screentime they give to him is my real problem with the movie. Well that's all there is to say about the movie. Next time were reviewing Rise of the Planet of the Apes since the sequel came out all ready. Until tomorrow everybody. Bye bye and stay safe.",

There are so many rich subplots and vivid backstories, and threats on the island, I'd rather you experience them for yourself rather than have me explain them, just watch this and you'll be immersed in this beautiful world directed by Peter Jackson. \r\n\r\nNaomi Watts is absolutely incredible as Ann Darrow, a down on her luck actress who is whisked away on an adventure, Watts looks amazing, her passion, expressions of terror, love and happiness dominate the screen, one of my all time favourites performances. Jack Black is superb as a selfish, and rather desperate filmmaker who takes Ann on his adventure, and it's when these characters stumble upon the horror of the island they develop as characters. Andy Serkis' facial capture and body movement work are as good as ever, bringing Kong to life! My favourite scene is where Jack Driscoll, Lumpy and Jimmy fall into a pit of darkness, and as the light beams down a legion of giant sized, slimy, oozy bugs emerge, consuming their prey in disgusting ways, it's a harrowing moment and very dark, this is where Jackson's direction gets tense and packed with threat. With spectacle beyond anything I've ever seen and a massive heart to match it's title character, King Kong is a near perfect adventure.",

            "content": "This film fucking sucked.  First off, let me say that I'm not a fan of the original King Kong, even though it's a classic staple in the B-Movie franchise.  Sorry, it's just not that good, and is quite overrated if one was to ask me.  So, another King decided to remake this film, but he is no good King.  No, we're talking the Legendary King of the Bronies, Peter Jackson behind the camera.  Okay, so many people were excited about this film, due to his involvement.  Was I one?  Ehhhh, maybe.  I mean, I'm all in for a good creature feature, but Kong just wasn't my style.  \n\nUpon first viewing in '05, I thought this film was great.  Mainly cause of the big action set pieces, and the tragedy of Kong as a character.  So, that was like 9 years ago, and upon viewing it on Monday, I was shocked at how bad it was.  My taste sure has adapted.  For better or worse, I have no clue.  Kong's first major problem is it's rather terrible pacing.  Many scenes are dragged out to fit the entire 3 hour runtime, and it really does feel rusty after seeing the same scene over and over again.  The film plods and it doesn't let up.  I mean, I don't want a 1 hour version of it, but at least make the film a little shorter.\n\nJackson was being pretty ambitious with this project.  Remaking a cult classic right after coming away with 3 of the most critically and financially acclaimed films.  Then, he wants to make this.  The result is admirable, but of course, the film leaves much, especially in the acting department.  Jack Black can be a good drama actor after viewing Bernie, but here he's completely shoddy.  His character can sometimes be unintentionally funny, especially in the serious scenes.  Naomi Watts, who is one of my favorite actresses ever, is completely wasted here.  I mean, her role is big, but she definitely missed the mark, and again, there are some unintentionally funny moments with her.  Adrien Brody is Adrien Brody aka the White Snoop Dog.  Interpret that as you will.  It's not that there is bad acting going, much less bad directing.  \n\nThe dialogue in this film ranges from unintentional funny moments to rather groan worthy lines to decent lines.  The script rings with cheese, but Jackson takes the film too seriously.  \"T'was beauty that killed the beast.\"  Yeah, nice try King Brony.  It's obvious that he was trying to go for an action adventure Shakespearean-esque tragedy, mixing in lines of dialogue fitted for the 16th century rather than the 20th.  It's a try, and I'll give him that.  \n\nThe action scenes and special effects have been receiving acclaim for it's stunning realism.  While I do agree that at times the effects do look stunning, there are moments where it looks terrible, namely when Kong fights the V-Rex (Not T-Rex, V-Rex).  I'm sorry, but it just didn't work in that scene.  Just look at Naomi Watts in Kong's hand and you'll see what I'm talking about.  Then, there's the dinosaur race scene, and while pretty cool to look at, it's just too silly to be taken seriously.  Sorry that I'm supposed to care about these one-dimensional characters.\n\nWhich brings me to my next complaint.....the film has barely any character development.  Sure, the scene where Kong and Watts interact has some, but there's only like 2 or 3 scenes like that.  Everyone is just a cardboard cut-out set on this film to either die or cause trouble.  For a film that's fucking 3 hours long, it takes a long time to get to character development, and when most of the people die, I would laugh rather than feel sorrow.  Seriously, when those teeth, penis worms ate that one Irish, I literally gave no fucks.  Not a single fuck.  Even when Kong died, my fuck still wasn't awarded to Jackson.\n\nThen.....there's the silly over-the-top ending.  Look, I know that it's an iconic ending, but it really sucks.  Kong climbs to the top of the Empire State Building with his booty call, and for the sake of Love, he dies.  Note, he is shot up by planes,  Listen, I can see why this would be tragic, but it's also very silly.  Watching a CG monkey destroy planes is absolutely the worst part, and for the same reason everything else in this film sucks: It's given this so serious treatment.  This is why these Kong movies will forever be inferior to the Godzilla movies.  They take themselves too seriously.  It leads to one of the most pretentious films ever.\n\nIn the end, I really realized how terrible my taste was a decade ago,  King Brony finally takes a stab at his fellow King.  Does it fail?  Yeah, in every conceivable manner, besides a comedy.  It's hilariously pretentious and I actually laughed at it.  However, I also laugh at the Godzilla films, so why do I like those but hate this?  Well, the Godzilla films are not to be taken seriously, but this! This film think it's some revolutionary monster flick, when in reality, it's just hiding behind a thin veil of terrible acting, directing, and  in some respect, CGI.  But...Naomi Watts is still beautiful to look at, so +1.",

The green screen overkill, CGI abuse and bad acting was horrendous! The first hour was entertaining and had me curious, but upon landing on skull island I soon was ready for this journey to end. The dinosaur stampede that ended up in what felt like a half hour session of them tripping over each other was the point that made me go from feeling boredom to pure disgust. Adrien Brody and cast were running in front of endless green screens and it got old fast. The cast was full of talented individuals. Jack Black, Adrien Brody, Kyle Chandler, Colin Hanks... but alas even the best actors can wind up in terrible films every now and then.\n\nThe characters Hayes and Jimmy the sailors were completely unnecessary and I could have cared less about their existence in the world of Kong. Speaking of characters what was up with the ridiculous Disney style sailors and 1930's dorks sprinkled throughout this big budget flop?? The acting was awful, the dialogue was written for incredibly stupid audiences and the look of this film was like that of an early Play Station 2 video game. Overall with the massive budget, the crew the size of an army and a decent cast... Peter Jackson and company really dropped the ball on this one. Peter, your mother and I aren't mad... just disappointed. Okay and a little mad. What a waste of time, money and most of all... potential. This will be looked back on in fifty years and people will laugh at how reliant early 2000's filmmakers were on CGI. I'll take the 1933 classic over this any day.",

I like how it's set in the 1930s, just like the original one. What makes this film strong is the visual design of King Kong. Peter Jackson once again did a great job of designing the Kong with motion capture. Andy Serkis does the motion capture of the Kong and is it me or has he been motion capture actor in most of Peter Jackson's films like The Lord Of The Rings franchises and The Adventures Of TinTin, I wonder what he's gonna do for his next film. Anyways, the only problems with this film are the supporting actors. I just don't care about those character. I mean why is Jack Black in this movie anyways. I understand how he acts as Carl Denham in the film, but why him. I just can't see it. On the other hand, Naomi Watts performance was really strong. Unlike the original when Ann Darrow is the usual women who screams and gets kidnapped all the time by the Kong. In conclusion, King Kong is a fine reboot, but nothin to surpass the original.",

The stars like Jack Black and the others are pretty good for the movie being three hours. One hour is New York, second is the island, and the third is back to New York.\n\nThe guy who played King Kong was the guy who played Golem. Meaning there was a real person behind the CGI and not just a picture or air. There's a lot of talking in the movie and when they meet the islands natives they are nothing like the original. As well as all the other wildlife and there's even a scene where there's a giant stampede. I also like how they make King Kong just a misunderstood creature. Instead of a mindless killing machine since that's kinda how most monster movies are. As well as having a helpless damsel in distress who just screams a lot. THIS version doesn't have a lady who just screams a lot and actually contributes a little to Kong. She even warms up to him after she does some skits.\n\nThe original King Kong I never saw but I've seen people parody it sometimes. Also the original King Kong was Peter Jackson's inspiration to do movies when he was a boy. I DO have the original on dvd so I guess I'll have to take a look at the movie too. Heard that was one of the first movies to try stop motion and that is a dying art.\n\nAnyway give both the original and the Peter Jackson remake a watch and see what you think you like. I liked the Peter Jackson one but it is pretty long and the audience sometimes lacks patience for long.",

            "content": "Remakes have practically become a staple amongst filmmakers, although it is not like this is a relatively new idea; it has been around since the earliest decades of motion pictures. But in recent years there has been an almost nauseating excess in this kind of thing. In the 90's they were quite few (the only example I can think of is The Fly), but then the new millennium was ushered in and with it came remakes for \"Willy Wonk and the Chocolate Factory\", \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\", \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\", \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" and a slew of others. Even so, there is one example amongst these that stands out as a substantial update: Peter Jackson's \"King Kong\".\n\nNow the first thing that comes to most peoples' minds when they hear the name Peter Jackson is the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Granted, these are very good movies that I thoroughly enjoyed both in the theaters and on home video release, but my vote for this director's best film goes to \"King Kong\". Much like his previous projects, this one was grand in scale, but with more of an emphasis on feeling and heart than spectacle, even though there is plenty of that to behold.\n\nThe film opens up with a stylistic sequence that excellently captures the feel of what anyone would imagine the 1930's felt like; the quick shots of primates are a nice touch. Subsequently, we get a formal introduction to the stories of both Anne Darrow and Carl Denham, both of which are given more detail in comparison to the 1933 classic. From here on, everything proceeds in a manner similar to the original, albeit with a stretched out first act, a few new sequences and some liberties taken with the characters. It is from the former that most peoples' objections stem from. Unlike such projects as \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", where something new came around regularly to either amuse or shake the audience out of their seats, the entire first act of King Kong can come across as drawn out or bloated, containing scenes that do not serve any real purpose. Even so, I have come to appreciate it for serving as a testament that Peter Jackson intended to make the most of every moment he had to make this film. When we see a scene of a young crew member interacting with the first mate or the lead actor first entering his lodgings, it does not have to be there, but brings the setting of the ship to life in a manner not attempted before. I also agree with Roger Ebert's identification of this approach as a means of making the first appearance of the monster more effective, bringing me to my next point. \n\nIt is well documented that Jackson has a great respect for the 1933 King Kong, a sentiment that has motivated him to borrow elements from it without veering into imitation, instead paying tribute to it. After seeing \"King Kong\" in theaters I was motivated to watch the original, and after I did I could recall many examples of homage that Jackson included in his film. Some of these fall under the category of dialogue lifted directly from the original, but, again, this does not come across as plagiarism. These lines, while barely altered, are generally used in a different context. One of the better examples is the first reference to the existence of Kong. Originally, it was used by Denham to inspire the belief of something worthwhile on the island. Here, it is used as an ominous warning by the crew for what could possibly be on the island. Both versions work for different reasons.\n\nThe character work is commendable in general, with some new details that bring new life to the stories of some of the key players, with Anne Darrow being the standout. I will readily admit that a strong case can be made that Jack Black was miscast as the obsessive Carl Denham, but I still feel that there are things to appreciate with this take on the character. As opposed to Robert Armstrong's portrayal, which was fittingly detached and single minded, Black manages to bring a sense of insecurity to the role, which can be seen in many instances when his plans come crashing down. There is a particularly effective example of this when he speaks to the audience during the display of Kong, and Denham perceives the praise he has sought after for so long, which makes the imminent events leave him all the more desolate. Again, while I cannot say which is more effective, both bring something to admire. Adrian Brody, however, is far too subdued and stiff to be worth going into detail about. \n\nThe key element of the film, however, is the relationship between Anne Darrow and Kong himself, which, in my eyes, is primarily what makes this iteration of the story different from previous ones. The innovation of having Anne reciprocate the feelings of care that Kong feels was first seen in the 1976 remake, but portrayed in such a silly manner as to evoke nothing beyond amusement. Jackson probably detested that movie because he saw the potential with this new approach, in essence making his own the rectification of a mistake. Here, this element is refined significantly, making for a very dynamic relationship that has an impressive degree of depth and poetry. Both of the characters are crucial to making this work.  Kong himself is a remarkable visual achievement, able to express a wide range of emotions and, much like the 1933 incarnation, feeling more human than the actual human cast. Thanks to the time devoted to have Anne understand Kong, there are new insights given into the monster that are not seen in either of the other film versions. For example, as Roger Ebert pointed out, in the final act, after witnessing the behavior of other people, Kong shows he intends to protect Anne from the rest of her species, and later at the top of the Empire State Building as the two of them witness the sunrise he halfheartedly begins to beat his chest in an expression of dominance that calls back to earlier moments, perhaps to retain her confidence; maybe he knew what was coming. There is even a nice throwaway detail within the middle act: as Kong is carrying Anne to the top of the waterfall, we briefly see what appear to be the skeletal remains of another Kong. This is a reminder that Kong is the last of his kind and that loneliness is a big burden he carries. \n\nNaomi Watts gives an exceptional performance as Anne, made all the more impressive by the fact that most of the time she had to interact with thin air, showing that given the right direction it is possible to be convincing even if you have only your imagination to go off of; this is one of the few elements in which the remake outclasses the original. She too conveys a wide range of emotions and even manages to bring a sense of strength and steadfastness that was not present in the character before. An excellent example of this is when she first uses her performance skills to entertain Kong, which is essentially the first step in the evolution of the emotional focus. Very much in the spirit of the classic tale \"Beauty and the Beast\", she goes from being terrified to being able to glimpse the humanity in this creature, something that nobody else in the movie sees. Every time I watch this movie, it surprises me how emotionally invested I am in this.\n\nThe visuals, as can be expected, are top notch and possess the same sense of majesty that is found in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, even though both styles are noticeably different. The two scenes of Anne and Kong admiring the sun on the horizon are fine examples of the beauty aspired to here. Just as impressive is the soundtrack, which I believe perfectly complements and bolsters the action, particularly during the climax and just before the closing credits; this makes for a finale that packs quite a wallop.\n\nWhile it is not quite the achievement that the 1933 \"King Kong\" was, Peter Jackson's take on the timeless tale is a wonderful movie experience that, ultimately, helps you appreciate the original even more. That is what I believe makes it a successful remake: it reinvents the original while honoring and celebrating it.",

Adrien Brody also plays his part greatly, he feels right for this role. Naomi Watts plays her part good too, ESPECIALLY when Kong gets captured, from that moment she just takes it away. \n\nThe effects for the dinosaurs, some scenery and of course, Kong, is just perfect, Kong especially. Kong feels real, with emotion and all. His fighting scenes are epicly action packed, and his capture was sadly beautiful. His finale just feels epic, and the ending to this amazing epic is just mesmerising. \n\nOverall, no-one could of done better at this than Peter Jackson. The sets are awesome, the effects are perfect and the cast are great. His remake is one epic film, and one of the best movies ever made. Epic.",

Listen: no, it's not. \r\n\r\nOn one side because these things require moderation and calibration, on the other side because computer graphics often give an alienating feeling of volatility, inconsistency, and cold unreality. Are we in a cinematic surreality or in a Playstation videogame? \r\n\r\nThe most frightening creature that you're going to see in the whole movie is ultimately Adrien Brody's nose. \r\n\r\nAlmost the totality of the second part unwinds through a mass of worthless and exasperating action sequences. Frank Joe Black, I really can't remember his exact name, plays the role of a cynic, self serving, egotistical character, which - in the second half - is practically a totally mono-faced guy: grim gaze focused on something or lost into nothing. Naomi Watts makes a fool of herself playing the part of a perverted zoophiliac falling in love with a 26 feet tall gorilla. And then they tell you that size doesn't matter! It's a pity that there aren't explicit scenes.\r\n\r\nAdrien Brody in turn is a feeble-minded idiot fallen in love with a girl since half an hour but already ready to give all of his blood for her. Furthermore, he's a writer of mediocre playlets, which poses as a superhero in his free time.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts out okay, and then becomes silly and long-winded, factually a huge waste of money. And all this while the children of Biafra are still without a Playstation.",

King Kong`s expressions and body language is so well done you will have a hard time holding back your tears. The screenplay florishes from start to finish and that is very prominent in the emotional and beautiful scenes with Kong and Ann. There are also a ton of breathtaking action sequences you would expect from such a powerhouse of a blockbuster. Everything about this movie is so expertly crafted and well-paced.

The surviving crew totally disappears once the third act hits, making much of the journey feel like a real waste. The action sequences are also indulgent to the point of tedium, each losing any sense of peril or dramatic stakes after a few minutes. Regardless, there's some truly spectacular use of miniatures, a great amount of care poured into every aspect of art design, and the central four cast members (Serkis, Watts, Brody, Black) are also quite good. This was clearly a labor of love for Jackson, and could have been a near-masterpiece with a massive re-edit.",

Yes, and very well.\nThe Peter Jackson's King Kong broke all expectations, not only is very faithful to the King Kong of 1933, but with superb visuals and a fantastic performance. Naomi Watts is excellent; Adrien Brody as always fantastic and Jack Black it was a surprise, a comedy actor gives us a simply superb performance, but makes you laugh in some parts of the film, and Andy Serkis as Kong ...

            "content": "Filmmaker \"Carl Denham\" (Jack Black) wants to make a movie at the mythical \"Skull Island\", but the studio won't fund the project. So, with stolen movie equipment, \"Denham\" plans to make the film no matter what. However, his leading actress pulled out, and he must find another who will brave the journey. \r\n\r\nEnter \"Ann Darow\" (Naomi Watts), an attractive, struggling stage actress/dancer who just lost a job. She agrees to go with \"Denham,\" who tells her that they are going to Singapore. And they head to the docks, where studio officials and police show up to arrest the director. \r\n\r\nOn the ship, \"Darrow\" meets the tough crew, arrogant actor \"Bruce Baxter\" (Kyle Chandler) who is a gentleman to \"Darrow\", and playwright \"Jack Driscoll\" (Adrien Brody), whom \"Darrow\" is anxious to work with. \r\n\r\nEventually, the island, which is known as \"Skull Island\", is found and much of the ship's crew, \"Denham\" and his cast go ashore, where they find freaky looking natives and the largest man-made wall they've ever seen. \r\n\r\nThe natives, who look peaceful at first, then attack their visitors and take \"Darrow\" into custody. They then offer the blond beauty to their god -- a 25 foot tall silverback gorilla (Andy Serkis, whose movements were recorded for reference to animate the CGI gorilla), who becomes smitten with the actress. \r\n\r\nAs \"Darrow\" warms up to the giant gorilla, a rescue party/film crew goes into the dense jungle where enormous animals, including dinosaurs, live. Many of the men are killed by the animals and the gorilla, but \"Darrow\" is saved. But \"Denham,\" who wants to make money, wants to bring back the gorilla to New York City to make a buck. \r\n\r\nAnd so, the gorilla is brought back to \"The Big Apple\" where a modified story of his capture is told as he is presented on a Broadway stage. However, the wild animal escapes when it discovers that for the stage show, \"Darrow\" was replaced by a lookalike (Julia Walshaw), and it eventually makes its way to the Empire State Building to make its famed climb to the top of the skyscraper. \r\n\r\nThe first thing you will notice while watching this film is that there are some incredible CGI special effects and incredible cinematography. I would strongly suggest that you find a widescreen edition on DVD because the full-screen just doesn't do the movie justice. \r\n\r\nNot all of the CGI effects in the film, especially when the human cast is in the scene, and they are surrounded by CGI. You can easily tell that they are in front of a blue or green screen and added into the scene during post-production. \r\n\r\nThere are some good performances in this film. In my opinion, out of the entire main cast, Black's performance is one of the weaker performances. Sometimes his performance works, while at other times he just didn't appear to make much of an effort. Also, Brody was just wrong for the romantic leading male in this film. His performance was pretty good, but there are better leading men, who are a lot better looking, who could have worked much better in this role. \r\n\r\nOne huge thing that was a major problem in the movie is that it is over three-hours long. Because of the movie's length, many scenes are drawn-out and lags frequently. One thing that should have been cut down is the time the movie spends on the search for \"Darrow\" in \"Kong's\" jungle. I was was wishing for the movie to go forward to NYC and skip the capture of the gorilla. \r\n\r\nOne thing that fans of the 1933 \"King Kong\" will love is that there are references to that version throughout the film. Peter Jackson, who directed this remake, also used props from the 1933 version that he has personally collected over the years. One scene fans of the original 1933 version will love is that \"Denham\" films \"Baxter\" and \"Darrow\" acting out a scene from the original film word-for-word. There is even a direct reference to Fay Wray, the original \"Darrow,\" Merian C. Cooper, who co-wrote the original \"King Kong\" and RKO Studios, which released the original 1933 movie. \r\n\r\nDespite the flaws, this version of \"King Kong\" is really good. With good performances, amazing special effects, and way too many references to the original 1933 movie, is fun to watch. I personally wish it was at least 40 minutes shorter, or even 100 minutes, which is the approximate run time of the original film.",

        {
            "content": "After the huge critical and commercial success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Peter Jackson surely must\u00e2(TM)ve been thinking what next?  Well, the answer to that is to do a remake of 1933 classic King Kong, the single film that inspired Jackson to become a film director.  A master class in CGI and motion capture, King Kong (2005) tells the story of a film producer in search of a good film only to stumble across a giant gorilla called King Kong, capture him and take him to New York.\n\n        Peter Jackson clearly loves an epic and immensely long film, and this film doesn\u00e2(TM)t change anything, because from the opening shots of 30\u00e2(TM)s New York, to the emotional ending, King Kong notches up a length of roughly three hours.  So, this film is long, almost as long as Adrien Brody\u00e2(TM)s nose and this review, and it is epic.  The film is so long because Peter Jackson seems to stuff piles of rather irrelevant content into this film, causing splatters of boredom dotted around the film and a satisfactory feeling when the film finally ends. \n\n        In my opinion, I felt that there was a lack of clear storyline; however that is forgotten when you\u00e2(TM)re introduced to the large periods of high-octane action, with some epic chases and some even more epic fights, in particular a truly heart-pounding action sequence involving romping and chomping, flipping and kicking, head locks, a sweet dose of serious ass-kicking, three T-Rexes and one giant gorilla.  What\u00e2(TM)s not to love? \n\n        For me, King Kong\u00e2(TM)s performance is vital to making this film a success, and clearly I felt the same as Peter Jackson, as he reunites with Andy Serkis, aka Gollum from LOTR, picked to portray the abominable King Kong, thanks to marvellous CGI and motion capture.  Andy Serkis does not let you down, bringing emotion, intelligence, passion and most of all; some wonderfully crafted ape-like characteristics to the table. \n\n        King Kong also boasts some surprisingly marvellous performances; first and foremost Jack Black who, taking a break from his natural habitat comedy, eclipses previous outings into seriousness as Carl Denham a character who transforms from an angry producer keen to prove his critics wrong to a man who obsesses over his film and shortly begins to lose his moral compass doing anything for success, even capture an 8m tall gorilla and take him to New York.  Other actors who shine are Jamie Bell as Jimmy, a kleptomaniac found abandoned on Venture (the boat they go to Skull Island on), Thomas Kretschmann as Captain Engelhorn and Evan Parke as Ben Hayes.\n\n        Finally there are the marvels of the computer-generated island of Skull Island.  It is magnificent.  Jackson and co have created a truly magical and mystical world ridden with giant insects and dinosaurs, yeah that\u00e2(TM)s right, dinosaurs!  95% of the action in the film takes place on the island, with the ork-like natives on the island attacking Carl and his crew in a scene that is both heart-pounding and strangely interesting to watch and the many fights and chases on the island.  Also, as the home of two thirds of the film, Skull Island had to be perfect.  And it was.  They have created a place that is shrouded in both fog and mystery and littered with strange and nicely crafted creatures and some truly magical landscapes.  \n\n        This film is a wonderful example of filmmaking.  Peter Jackson has made another film that while being over three hours long, is also enthralling, high-octane and surprisingly heart-warming.  Yes, it is long, yes the plot is rather simplistic but this film is a success down to the wonderful creation of Skull Island and a magical performance from Andy Serkis as King Kong.",

And when King Kong protects his love interest from rampaging rexes who are dead-set on chowing down on her, they don't reconsider a bigger meal in King Kong instead. Last but not least, there's a bit too much emotional manipulation going on in this film. That last point, however, presents a strength at the same time; you feel something for the title character, who is catapulted into a world in which he does not have a chance against his will, and he gets destroyed trying to not only get to grips with his new surroundings, but protect the one whom he's set his eyes on.",

The scenes I didn't like were surprisingly only included in the Director's Cut; if I see the theatrical cut, I am apt to liking it even more. The production values are top-shelf, and the acting is perfectly acceptable, but it is Jackson's Kong that makes the film a winner. He is a truly captivating character, despite not being human; a true challenge for any director. I also adored the New Zealand scenery, of which there could've been a bit more time devoted to.\n\nThere were some scenes that were hard to sit through; particularly the natives scene and of course the iconic sacrificial-attempt scene. I guess I may be soft, but these scenes were beyond creepy. And of course, the excess killings and gore didn't help much either. And what was with dropping the scene from the trailer where Ann screams on the shore of the island while filming a scene for Carl's film? I thought this was a great invite into the mysteries of the island and a perfect way of \"introducing\" the beast that is Kong.\n\nThe film is too long; the scene where Kong is looking into Ann's eyes while on top of the Empire State Building went far too long and was emotionally excessive.\n\nAll in all, a great film that I wouldn't mind watching (the theatrical cut) sometime soon.",

In addition, it features a great cast that delivers a great performance, especially when taking into consideration the extent to which CGI was used in this picture. Furthermore, it is enhanced by an amazing score and beautiful visuals. \nI guess you could complain about the lack of verisimilitude in the action scenes (people not dying as much as they ought to), but I can get past that and find them all to be lots of fun.\nFinally, for those of you who are very attached to the original, if you watch this trying to compare the two movies, in the words of Thumper the skiing instructor, \"You're gonna have a bad time\".",

Naomi Watts, One Of The Greatest Actresses To Have Ever Lived, Portrays An Out Of Work Actress Named Ann Darrow.

Both Weta Digital - the effects company Jackson used for both this film and The Lord of the Rings trilogy - and Andy Serkis (who does a stunning job bringing Kong to life using motion capture) did an incredible job with the creation of King Kong, whose scene-grabbing prescense is clear from the first time we see the 25-foot gorilla.

            "content": "At over 3 hours long this epic fantasy adventure film remakes not only a classic film, but the style of the golden era of Hollywood cinema. Peter Jackson is one of many film makers of his generation, including  Spielberg, Carpenter, Scorsese etc that pays homage and remakes classic Hollywood films. At once highly melodramatic, (which is the style) with a nonsensical thin plot, it is full of long action sequences with CGI that aren't that impressive. The exception to this, is of course the effects of Kong himself, which are excellent, perhaps due to the impressive digital effect techniques developed for Rings (2001-2003) and the body performance by Andy Serkis.The performances are good, with what they had to work with, following the genre style, they lack much character development, although thankfully there is not that much exposition, and Jackson handles the conveying of emotion and communication beautifully through imagery, as film making should be, and that's what makes him a great director. The film is overly long and the plot is highly unrealistic of course, but if you can get past the major illogical plot holes and fantastical elements, it is quite enjoyable. Naomi Watts gives a great performance, lifting her character up from what may have been purely the hysterical woman who screams, instead giving a gritty emotional, and funny performance that feels real. Although, of course she does scream a lot. Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody are the stand out performances, and Jack Black gives an average performance, while managing to tone down his over-the-top psychotic Jack Nicholson-esque character-type and has some nuance and subtly to his character. Jackson manages to capture both the Hollywood caricature nature of the characters while at the same time giving them some emotional depth and making them relatable. Overall, a fun adventure film, that has great visuals and cinematography  mixed good and bad CGI effects, good performances, but is far too long, with scene following scene of running through the jungle. At points it becomes almost horror genre-like as Anna (Naomi Watts) runs from one monster into another. Anna (Watts) manages to go through a lot of trauma and running around without injury or even getting dirt on her dress for a long time. It becomes a film that feels like the tag line should be \"People travel to an island and encounter lots of monsters\".",

It was entertaining enough, but it went on for way too long.  It could have easily been half as long as it was and been a much better film.  Take, for example, the part where the brachios or whatever they were tripped and were falling all over each other...there weren't even enough of them in the pack to make the fall last that long.  Cut that scene in half, you've shaved five or ten minutes off of the film right there.  Not only that, but the longest parts of the film were the absolute worst, like the film makers picked the most cringe-worthy moments and decided to drag them out as long as possible.  But, you know, it had its moments.  The ice scene was unnecessary, but cute.",

I'm not going to deny, Peter Jackson's re-visioning of a classic is over 3 hours long. Now, it's sort of weird but I'm not giving this film 5 stars, I'm not even going to give this 4.5 stars, and the reason why is because...some scenes drag. I HATE saying that but the movie has about 4 or 5 scenes in which it's pace slows down and it starts to drag. Now lots of people don't like the first 45 minutes because it's not on Skull Island. But I felt that the 3 or 4 out of the 5 scenes I've just said dragged, was on Skull Island. Unfortuanely, I felt some of the King Kong and Ann watching the sunset scenes just dragged. But besides those handful of scenes, this is still a great film. It really boosts up the action and improves on some things. Like I loved some of the performances in the film and the music by James Howard makes some of the draggy scenes enticing. Overall I have to say that, even though some scenes drag, this is still a great film. If your looking for a modern day King Kong made by one of the best directors of all time, this is your flick.",

Jack Black did his best rendition of Carl Denham but because of his past work in films like High Fidelity and Shallow Hal among many other low-brow comedies, he never really gets the drama quite right. I found it difficult to really engage with the leads as everyone despite the caliber of the cast felt like cardboard cutouts or barely-developed beings that just occupied space against the backdrop of (then glorious) CGI. To his credit and his attention to detail, Jackson faithfully recreates the 30's environment through mostly CGI as well as sets (though sparse). He has a real knack for that. However, the most egregious of all errors in this film was the length. The buildup (as many critics have already said) to actually seeing Kong is outright painful. I found myself checking my watch numerous times because I was frankly bored. After a while, I didn't much care about the action sequences or the very murky plot. I also felt Naomi Watts portrayal of Ann Darrow was imitation at best and her interaction with the supposedly human-like Kong seemed disinterested and not at all genuine. The ending of the film I felt was just as mean-spirited as the original was. I thought Jackson would offer a more uplifting and mature conclusion and by the end I never felt like this was Jackson's pet project.",

            "content": "Kong Kong (2005) is directed by Peter Jackson and is a remake of the 1933 original. It stars Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow, Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll, Jack Black as Carl Denham, Jamie Bell as Jimmy, and Andy Serkis does motion capture for King Kong. \n\nThis movie is extremely long, running at around 3 hr. 10 min. Whether that is a pro or a con, is dependent on how much you are invested in these characters. For me, the film could have cut a good ten minutes or so.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the film was its vibrant, colorful, New York setting that takes place during the Great Depression in 1933. There is a wonderful saturated palate throughout the film, and the visuals of the movie's first 40 minutes contrast heavily with the pallet that is set at Skull Island. \n\nThe movie spends a lot of time introducing you to the cast of characters, and, in all honesty, this long introduction creates for some of the best parts of the film (Jack Black is especially entreating in these moments). Most of the characters. namely Brody, Watts, Black, Jamie Bell, and Serkis, have their own individual personalties and each are easy to remember for their own unique traits. Naomi Watts and Brody do an admirable job of seeming truly in love with each other, and as things take a turn for the worse, Brody considers it his his duty to go and save this damsel in distress. Why in distress? Well because she's been taken by Kong of course. \n\nThat being said, there is also an entire slew of other characters that are essentially just there to die, and be eaten by giant bugs and dinosaurs on Skull Island.\n\nWhat is Skull Island? Its a mysterious\u00e2\u00a6 uh, island, set quite literally in the middle of nowhere. \n\nOnce on said island, there is a seemingly unnecessary scene of it's indigenous people going madly wild, causing the movie to take a sharp turn into the \"Horror\" genre for a moment. I found this annoying, and that it would have been benefited from a little more subtly. \n\nThis film has the best special effects i have ever seen, hands down. Although the film was made in 2005, one would be hard-pressed to find special effects done this well in any blockbuster film post or pre '05. The masterful job on the effects creates for quite unique character development between Kong and Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) which is quite the feat, because of course, they cannot speak to each other. Kong demonstrates a lot of personality and by the end of the film I found myself quite invested in him as though he were a real animal.\n\nBut its not only Kong who is brought to life remarkably well, there are also huge beasts for a good chunk of the film that have grave encounters with Kong and the humans. There were perhaps, a few to many of these scenes, but non the less, most of the time it was quite entertaining to see Kong and 3 or 4 other carnivorous dinosaurs battle it out for the delicious morsel of food that is Naomi Watts. But really, this begs the question\u00e2\u00a6 why doe these damn dinos want to eat this pretty girl so bad? It really doesn't make much sense, though it isn't that difficult to ignore once you see how breathtaking the particular fight-sequence is.\n\nThe film can essentially be divided into four large chunks in this chronological order: New York, the Ship, Skull Island, and New York again. The final act, is emotionally poignant, but only if you are not exhausted from the 2 hr. 40 min. that it took to get up to that point.\n\nWith good acting, (namely a brilliant performance from Andy Serkis as Kong), good character development, and an emotional ending, I would give this film an 8/10.",

The cinematography was also top of the line.\n\nThe main bone I have to pick with this movie is that it is 3 hours. The end was dragged out too long.\n\nThe animation was really good but no part of it was better than how they did Kong himself. His movement felt perfect. They also packed so much sorrow into his eyes that it was truly beautiful. I was on the verge of tears at several points in this film.\n\nSome of the jungle chase scenes got a little repetitive. I would have cut some of them out altogether even though most of them were unique and cool.\n\nThey also did a really good job of giving nods to the original film. Things like killing a T-Rex by snapping it's jaw are pleasant Easter eggs for people who like the original film.\n\nSUMMARY: A really excellent follow-up to a classic. I was very pleasantly surprised./",

Sure, King Kong is indeed full of quarks, and it does indeed have its fair share of problems, but its mysterious, captivating build-up to such a vast and wondrous journey with colorful characters are all what make this film among the best of its kind. This is what remakes and Hollywood blockbusters should strive to be.\n\nHere's my full review: http://youtu.be/udo3rl9Lb3k",

The beginning is way too slow and long it takes like 45 minutes for things to get interesting and you still don't see King Kong until like 70 minutes in. The middle is good with lots of action on a prehistoric island, with dinosaurs, King Kong, guys with guns and really large insects, even though some of the action is just stupid. The ending is good, it's just drawn out too much. Naomi Watts is really good in this movie as well as Adrian Brody. I kind of had a tough time accepting Jack Black as Carl Denham but I guess he was okay.",

The comparatively monstrous budget gives way to an impressive script that seamlessly evokes the 30s time period - as if either period piece or unsuspecting adventure epic direction could've proceeded the start - as well as an entertaining jurassic setting choc full of the visible inspiration responsible for any of Jackson's geek projects. It swiftly engages despite the duration and you can't fault the cast, shockingly blending usual-side thorn Jack Black in with the professional, likable mix, matching the quality in the special effects and directing departments. Essentially outdoes the combined LOTR trilogy for my money's worth.",

Brody did a good job, and Jack Black did a great job at being a jerk. and as much as i hate her previous work, watts did ok. she is one of the few actresses in the kong movies to actually LOVE kong. so i give her credit for that. For once, id love to see the ending re-written, see Kong win. the video game for this movie did that, and it was glorious. i was just sad to see such an amzing character meet his unavoidable end.",

This beautifully shot remake, double the length of the treasured original, gives dimension to the characters, even Kong himself, whose humane qualities are brought to life with the combination of incredible CGI and an outstanding performance by Andy Serkis. It's quite rewarding to see the tender interactions between Kong and his beloved blonde - the lovely Naomi Watts in an excellent turn - as his affections for her grow stronger over the course of the film. The mandatory action sequences are also very impressive and are exciting to watch, though the computerised effects disappoint on some occasions here. After a mixed bag of remakes, sequels, and spin-offs, King Kong is back where he belongs.",
