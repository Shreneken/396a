            "content": "Along with Interiors(in a way), Match Point seems to be one of Woody Allen's most divisive films and that's understandable. With me, it is good but not great, interesting but Allen has done better(much worse as well). The ending was surprising which wasn't a problem, but it was also much too rushed and ambiguous, at odds with the rest of the pacing of the film. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and the script also didn't come across as consistent to me. Meyers is handsome and does make for a creepy sleaze in some parts of the film but at other points he underplays so much that he comes across as one-note. The script does have a very neat and healthy balance of sporting analogies and psychological questions, beautifully observed in distinctive Woody Allen fashion, unfortunately there are some clumsy moments and some out-of-place mordant humour(if anyone disagrees that's fine, it's just personal taste). The London locations, it's entertaining spotting the familiar ones, look splendid though and the filming reflects the dark, gritty nature of the story very effectively. The score is haunting, giving an ominous tone to scenes in need of it, and opera enthusiasts will love the healthy dose of opera excerpts throughout(though you wished they had a grander approach). The story even with the clear influence of Allen's 1989 masterpiece Crimes and Misdemeanours(a much better film) is an absorbing one, despite much of it being a slow-burner. Especially in the second half which takes a more violent turn without feeling mismatched. The gritty atmosphere worked in the story's favour as did the neatly interwoven plot points and story layers(the romance did have some resonating moments), and the characters as ever with Allen had a fair amount of realism though Chris was not very easy often to root for. Allen directs with control and assurance, though he's at his best in comedy-dramas like a lot of his films from the late 70s all the way through to the early 90s. With the acting, while Rhys Meyers didn't always convince, the largely British do some fine work, especially Matthew Goode and Brian Cox- James Nesbitt has been much better though- and Scarlett Johnansson in sultry, compassionate mode is superbly cast. Overall, interesting film and a good one(at its best even very good), but not great, Woody Allen has done better. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Woody Allen's Match Point is a movie about infidelity, privilege, and passion.  More importantly, it is a film about luck.  The opening scene sets the stage for what is to follow, posing the idea that random events beyond our control can impact the trajectory of our life.  When happily married former tennis pro Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) finds himself drawn into an affair with Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), the sexy but unstable ex-girlfriend of his brother-in-law, his life begins to spin out of control, leading to an unimaginable chain of events.  Beyond the strong performances of the leads, what makes Match Point a success is Allen's ingenious script.  Every scene adds to the story, either flushing out character details or adding to the complex web of deceit, capped with an ending that ties the luck theme up nicely.  Match Point is arguably the best offering in Allen's late career oeuvre.",

            "content": "It feels mad offering an opinion on a Woody Allen film when I've seen hardly any of his early output. His current yield is impressive in its frequency, he was recently averaging a film a year, and I have to say that everything I've seen up to until this point I've really enjoyed. Match Point stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Chris, a former tennis pro who meets Tom, a wealthy young man whose sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) falls in love with Chris. Problem is, when Chris meets Tom's fiancee Nola (Scarlet Johansson) he falls for her. It's another darkly comedic tale, and although as a tennis fan the tennis action is, as usual, farcical, it does seem as if Meyers has actually held a racket before. Which is something that couldn't be said for Paul Bettany or Kirsten Dunst in Wimbledon (2004) as much I still hold a soft spot for that film. Meyers is particularly good,  there's a brooding menace seemingly simmering below the surface of his affable personality, and he never quite seems comfortable in his own skin. Chris isn't a nice character, but you remain interested in the outcome and the film as a whole because despite the characters being unlikable, they remain intriguing. It's not up there with Allen's best of recent times; I would argue it's not even the best Allen film starring Johansson (Vicky Christiana Barcelona [2008] if you're wondering) and it's not in the same league as something like Blue Jasmine (2013), or my favourite Allen film to date, Midnight In Paris (2011). But it is a good watch, and the crisp performances across the board give the film a real sinister air that holds until its finale.",

            "content": "Woody Allen's claim that this is one of the best films he ever made is proof that artists are often not the best judges of their own work. Acclaimed in 2005 as his big comeback this film has fallen in critical standing in the fifteen years since it's release and the fact that Allen made the deplorable Scoop (2006) one year after this success put the kibosh on the idea that he had returned to form. The film largely recycles plot elements and scenes from his other films, most notably Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), but fails to add anything new and employs an oddly written screenplay and some wooden performances to bring the story to life.\n\nRetired tennis player Chris Wilton, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, takes up a job as a tennis instructor in London and befriends the wealthy Tom Hewett, Matthew Goode, who introduces him to his family. Hewett's sister Chloe, Emily Mortimer, is attracted to Wilton and gets her powerful father Alec, Brian Cox, to give him a high paying job so that he will be more inclined to continue his relationship with her. When Wilton meets Hewett's American actress girlfriend Nola Rice, Scarlett Johansson, he begins an affair with her and continues it after Rice breaks up with Hewett. He marries Chloe but the two have trouble conceiving a child and she notices that he is constantly distracted leading her to suspect an affair. When Rice announces to him that she is pregnant he decides to kill her to maintain his secure lifestyle. Initially he fears his crime being discovered and when brought in for police questioning he admits his affair with Rice but another suspect has the crime pinned on him and he is able to continue living comfortably. When his child with Chloe is born he responds positively to Hewett stating that he needs luck more than greatness.\n\nThe dialogue in the film is suspect in so many ways as it seems like Allen wrote the screenplay in a different language and then translated it into English leaving some oddly phrased lines in there. It doesn't help that Allen has trouble understanding how people speak in the modern world and with out himself as a presence in the film the characters, who are meant to act young and hip, feel out of place. Most British critics noted that there were a lot of issues with the way that Allen wrote for his British characters as they refer to the \"Tate Modern\" and include slang where it would not be applied. It does not help that the two lead performances, from Rhys Meyers and Johansson, feel like modeling more than acting with all of the pouting and come hither looks. Rhys Meyers in particular fails as he plays a man who is meant to be charming and able to fool people into believing that he is a morally pure man but he acts like a sociopath from the beginning and his blanks tare communicates none of the emotional turmoil of Martin Landau in the 1989 film. Fortunately the British actors in the cast do more with their roles as Goode has the easy charm of a man who has never had to work for anything and Mortimer is perfect as a sweet woman who verges on cloying. \n\nThere is also less tragedy to the eventual killing of the mistress in the film as we are not encouraged to be sympathetic to her and the fact that she is a sex object more than a real, honest woman makes Allen feel exploitative. One of the brilliant touches in Allen's masterpiece is that we care about the Anjelica Huston character and see her not as an irrational woman attacking a largely innocent man but as a victim of a man who has led her on. The flashbacks of Huston and Landau on the beach during happier times allow us to understand how Landau got in so deep but here the relationship between Wilton and Rice is entirely based on sex so we do not feel sad when the two part ways. Even his tears and torment as he murders her do not have the resonance of the imagined conversations Landau has with a blind rabbi as while neither character ultimately cares about the woman they have killed there is no sad realization here as we never felt Wilton loved Rice in the first place.",

Now he has to live with what he did for the rest of his life. Being haunted and reminded of the crime he committed. \n\nIt was painful to see the lengths that he would go, all the lying and disloyalty that he did, just to make sure things don't get messed up and he could have whatever he wanted. \n\nOverall, pretty compelling story.

Woddy Allen's smart and finely detailed script is the real game changer in here along with his brilliant execution that makes you think twice. On performance level, the objective seems unsatisfied as the lead characters i.e. Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Meyers and Emily Mortimer aren't as convincing as they should have been. Match Point seems like a normal rom-com with a predictable twist until its last act hits on screen that may shake the audience dreadfully for despite of its genre it goes into places where Woody Allen has never been.",

The scene that he tried to kill Lola and the one that his subconscious confessed to himself in late night were remarkable. This reminds me of a book named An American Tragedy. The main difference between the book and the movie is that the main character in the movie ended up feeling guilty and full of sins for the rest of his life, while the one in the book ended up dead.

While Interiors is weighty and overwrought Match Point is daringly reserved in-spite of it's dark and foreboding tone. This is a moral & philosophical thriller  that accomplishes an operatic level of tension, which Crimes & Misdemeanors only skimmed the surface of. A film about class & luck, two social climbers try to make their way into a wealthy family, but only one has the grace and wit to succeed. Jonathan Rhys Meyers' Chris is well-mannered and modest but he's equally detached as he stealthily maneuvers his way into success. Scarlett Johansson's Nola on the other hand is blatantly rudderless with only her sensuality to keep her afloat. While the two have the same aims, their unbridled lust for one another could disrupt both their paths.\nThe third act of this film is my favorite. It's a calmly sadistic in it's tension as every slight movement and choice of the character brings into question what will get these two caught in the act. Having seen this 3 times already I was surprised by how much anxiety I had, despite knowing the outcome. There are long moments of artful quietness but the tension comes from knowing that luck is the only determining factor.\nFor a director who has made 50 movies over the past 48 years some of the best Woody Allen movies are the ones that have the least of his fingerprints. This is the first of his 2000's European career renaissance which includes Vicky Cristina Barcelona & Midnight In Paris. Both of those films are very Woody-esque, whereas Match Point has fewer recurring themes and is a half-hour longer than almost all of this movies. There is doomed adultery, unresolvable sins, nihilistic life views, henpecking mothers, the absence of sensuality within marriage and a moral dilemma. But what it doesn't have is monologizing or humor. Chris has dilemmas and judgements but he never discusses them. His greed and passions are private, and in the end he has to live with the darkness in his empty, albeit lucky world.",

            "content": "The Director of 'Annie Hall' (1977) is a pessimist by nature and his glass is always half empty. Humor and irony, which he uses in his movies, is only a cover for his fear of death and existential thoughts.\n\nBy making ' Crimes and Misdemeanors' (1989) Allen definitely showed his aspirations to create a great drama. The story of a Judah - a doctor living a double life (wife and a mistress) is getting complicated when the other woman starts to dictate conditions and threaten him. We can see the protagonist struggling between moral dilemmas and questioning existence of God in today's world. Allen presented a person living in lie, who thanks to the crime he decides to commit, lets himself free from making moral choices, problems with wife and social scandal. The movie is\na beautiful stadium of human's consciousness and religion.\n\nAllen will come back to the story told in 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' and in his other piece 'Match Point' (2005). The Director changed some elements and shifted the weight of the film from moral dilemmas, which took under consideration the existence of The Higher Power and moved it to the world deprived of God and his influence. Even though Judah is not punished by law and his crime remains a secret, we can see his internal struggle and overwhelming guilt. 'Match Point's' protagonist, Chris, does not know the feeling so familiar to Judah - being completely deprived of conscious and guilt, he simply moves on with his life. However, after having a closer look we can easily see that a luck accompanying Chris has a divine element and is not something usual. 'The man who said ' I'd rather be lucky than good,' saw deeply into life. People are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck', says 'Match Point's' protagonist at the same time, summarizing the story of his life.\nMany years before Henry James in his novel 'The Wings of the Dove' described a story of a young man who was in love with a woman but could not afford to marry her. At the same time, dying heiress of a fortune falls in love with the protagonist. Everyone is suggesting a fast wedding with sick and wealthy girl which, after her death, will allow him to marry the one of his dreams. The question is - is that ethical? In Allen's world no one has those kind of dilemmas and even sweet and innocent Chloe lets her father 'buy' her a husband. The main problem is the dilemma: greed or desire? Wanting to satisfy desire as well as greed, Chris can lose everything. In the world of moral order, the situation that he became apart of would be accompanied by guilt. However here it was replaced by fear. Money seems to be too strong of an aphrodisiac for Chris, whose 'practical' side wins over love.\n\nAfter weeks of indecisions and anxiety, the protagonist decided to make a drastic step in order to save and protect his wealthy lifestyle. His decision to swipe all his problems under the rug mean nothing else but murdering Nola. Being a conformist and a coward, Chris chooses to exist in the old scenarios than listen to his hear and turn his live around.\n\n'You never know what you are able to until you try', says Chris and his words bring to mind the words of Raskolnikow, Dostojewski's 'Crime and Punishment' protagonist. In the novel Rodion kills the old lady and her pregnant sister in order to steal their money and in the name of his theory about people who are destined for incredible things and change reality. He want to reassure himself if he is trash like everyone else or a human. Raskolnikov's crime is based of pretty popular theory dividing people into two categories: lower class people who are only the material bringing, similar to them, to this world and a 'proper' type of people, who have a gift or a talent letting them spread the 'new word'.\n\nChris, the protagonist of 'Match Point' seems to share Rodion's point of view claiming that 'innocent people have to sacrificed for the higher good'. His ' higher good' is belongingness to London's elite and the need to be and feel better than everybody. However, it should be noticed that, in both cases, the desire for wealth and power is not literal - it is mostly caused by the fear of being categorized as trash and a member of 'the lower class'.\n\nWoody Allen created his own Raskolnikow - Chris is deprived of moral rules and does not believe in God. Having a religious fanatic, who found the Higher Instance after losing his legs as a father, protagonist is very cynical towards religion and definitely does not consider it to be an important aspect of human life. The pain Chris's father went through made him a different man and helped him become reborn as a new person. Atheist Chris does not go through any changes and does not seem to feel any kind of guilt.\n\nDostojewski's Raskolnikow fails after trying to put his theories about 'unusual people' into action. Defeated by his own beliefs, he decides to admit to the committed crime and atone for it. Being a modern representative of Rodion's theory, Chris kills unscrupulously, without the feeling of evil and, the most importantly, without the punishment.\n\nRaskolnikow of the XXI century is deprived of the religious and conscious burden, tormenting his predecessor. Allen does not mention God. He makes his own rules and realizes them. When Dostojewski shows the crime and the punishment, the director seems to present the crime itself. God's and moral rules do not exist in 'Match Point' and the life of protagonists is dictated by luck and fortuity. Chris does not feel the weight of his actions or any kind of remorse - Rodion is on the opposite side, slowly getting into the nervous breakdown. Certain about the rightness of what he did, Allen's protagonist goes back to his daily routine of enjoying beloved opera and dinners at fancy restaurants. However, the last scene of the movie where one can see Chris looking far into the distance, the emptiness of his soul is very visible. There is only a shell- covered with shallow feelings and fake emotions shell.\n\nChloe, who could not get pregnant, right after Nola's murder, announces that she is expecting a baby. Also in this situation, Chris will never be punished and will never understand the evil he made. In the deprived of God's influence, Allen's world there is only luck of its lack. Nola's ghost, haunting him one night says that he made a lot of mistakes murdering her and that he did not plan it very well. Maybe, somewhere deep inside, he wanted to be caught and, at the same time, stopped in his dangerous rush into distraction.\n\nThe title 'match point' belongs to Chris - he won the game where Nola's, her baby were a rate and his future, were a rate. The price paid for his victory was, according to him, worth the trouble in order to 'achieve something in life'.\n\n'Match Point' is the modern story of Raskolnikow. Woody Allens seems to show ' what would happen if...' What would happen if Raskolnikow won over his doubts and fears and did not decide to go to the police? What would happen if Detective Porfiry would not be so determined to find the old woman's murderer? What would happen if Allen created a protagonist being a reflection of Dostojewski's Sonia? And, most importantly, what would happen if the theories claimed by the young Russian came true and gave him the right to dispose obstacles in order to achieve great things?\n\nThe perfect world for Dostojewski was the one being a part of God's plan, where God's love and mercy embraces even people who do not believe in his existence. Allen's goal was to present the world deprived of the Higher Instance where people are creating their own theories and moral rules. Quoting Dostojewski's novel, the director suggests what could have happened if the story of Raskolnikow ended differently and his 'happy ending' is only apparently good. It is a warning saying that evil has won, and man '... can do everything, if there is no God'.",

An hour and a half is about a married man having an affair and then it takes a weird turn with the unnecessary shooting. The acting wasn't that amazing and I wasn't that impressed with the ending which didn't give a great moral to the whole story. It's a different side to Woody Allen's writing which shows that he can do serious films as well. The only problem is that the storyline wasn't that great and the whole rich, English family concept was a bit pompous. Basically, I didn't really enjoy the film and I just got bored after a while. Disappointing!\n\nRound-Up\nI'm surprised that this movie took so much money at the box office because most of Woody Allen movies don't usually make that much money. On the plus side, you do end up sticking with the film because you wonder how the whole situation is going to pan out, but apart from that, it's just about your average love affair that turns sour. Anyway, if your into your slow romantic dramas then you will enjoy this film, I but was expecting something a bit more entertaining.Â \n\nBudget: $15million\nWorldwide Gross: $85.5million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there romantic dramas about a love affair that goes terribly wrong. 3/10",

At its core, the picture is a morality tale with no one to root for, and Allen revisits themes he first explored in \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" years earlier. The Jonathan Rhys Meyers character is despicable, but the actor is so good in the part that you're compelled to keep watching. \n\nCo-star Scarlett Johansson has never looked better on film, but it's clear that this is Woody's picture and it definitely revived his career. It can easily be recommended to non-fans as well. The best movies lead to the best debates, and there will be plenty for people to talk about afterwards because of all the moral issues the film raises, and it's apparent that many people will not like the ending.\n\nAllen makes a bold choice by having the one piece of evidence that could incriminate Meyers instead exonerate him, but I loved it. The thought-provoking and complex \"Match Point\" is made all the more complex by that key decision, and I applaud the director for doing so. It has made him vital again, and given him a film that ranks with his very best efforts.",

            "content": "Another great film from Woody Allen, and quite different to what we might normally expect from him. Match Point tells the story of Irish tennis player Chris Wilton (an Irish tennis player??) and his attempts to mingle in the British upper class. He befriends Tom, a young man from a very wealthy background and soon becomes friendly with his entire family. He gets engaged and married to Tom's sister, secures a great job thanks to Tom's father (played by the wonderful Brian Cox) and is even accepted by Tom's mother.\n\nThis latter character does not, however, accept Tom's girlfriend, Nola Rice (Johansson), whom Chris madly lusts. He puts everything at risk by sensually and provocatively making moves on Nola, finally succeeding and resulting in a lovemaking scene in the very heavy rain just a hundred metres from Tom, Chloe et. al. Things get more and more serious as the film goes on, eventually brimming to boiling point.\n\nAlthough I was disappointed by Rhys-Meyers' performance, the rest of the acting was of a high standard. Johansson, in particular, stood out with a smooth and very sexy performance. This changes throughout the film as she starts to fall madly for Chris, a transition also played well by Johansson. A very strong point of Allen's direction in this film is the metaphors and imagery related to tennis, specifically the moment when a ball hits the top of the net and, for a moment, could go either way. You'll have to watch the film to see exactly what I mean, but Allen works it superbly so that it has quite an impact on the story.\n\nOverall, a very strong picture from Woody Allen, with a tense story and some effective acting.\n\nOn a sidenote, two wonderful comedians, Alexander Armstrong and James Nesbitt appear in small roles.",

The camera falls for her sultry, pouty, American actress even as a tennis instructor falls under her spell.  \n\nAt first she is with the rich male whom the instructor is teaching, then she and the instructor (who is seeing his client's sister) have an impulsive sexual encounter that leads to an affair (after he has married the sister).  She wants more from him but gets seemingly empty promises and then when she badgers him more, he breaks and kills her neighbour in preparation for killing her.  \n\nIt's hard to figure out this instructor - what kind of guy he is at the core.  Is he melancholy?  Does he love the woman he marries or is he using her because of her wealth and because the other woman he has eyes for is with his client/friend?  He appears to be something of a psychopath or is not empathic as he murdered an uninvolved woman before murderering his pregnant lover; a later scene with the spirits(?) of  the two murdered women seems to paint the killer as psychopathic.  Although I have viewed this film (on dvd) more than once, it was hard to watch past a certain point but finally I watched, paid attention, all the way through. 6/10",

In der Tradition von Filmen wie Crimes and Misdemeanors geht es bei Match Point um Mord und Totschlag - eine logische Weiterentwicklung von den unzähligen Seitensprüngen die seine Filme sonst immer zieren.\n\nSo, da wären wir schon beim ersten Problem von Match Point angelangt - ich mag Woodys Filme dieser Prägung nicht. Crimes and Misdemeanors, vielgerühmt, alles einer der besten Allen-Filme überhaupt, finde ich höchst mittelklassig. Allen ist ganz einfach der Meister des humorvollen Dialogs. Diesen zu Gunsten von Krimiplots\" zu minimieren macht meines Erachtens nicht viel Sinn.\nNicht das diesen Filmen Woodys wundervolle Dialoge zur Gänze abgehen, aber seine Verstrickungen und Mordpläne sind meist weniger elaboriert, als die von mittelmäßigen TV-Krimiserien. Das ist ganz einfach nicht seine Stärke - romantische Komödien mit philosophischem Anspruch schon.\n\nUngewöhnlich für Allen ist auch, dass er den Charakteren durchaus Raum zu Atmen gibt, und nicht in sein strenges Korsett aus Spleens zwängt. So ist kein Woody-Äquivalent im Cast zu finden.\n\nNichtsdestotrotz, ist Match Point einen Abstecher Wert und v.a. der erste und der letzte Akt sind Spitze (und ein guter letzter Akt ist bei Allen ohnehin selten zu finden). Der Cast ist ebenfalls Weltklasse: Jonathan Rhys-Meyers und Scarlett Johansson spielen nicht nur ausgezeichnet, sie sehen auch unglaublich toll aus.

The story moves along although it does start to unravel toward the end.  The repetitive messaging becomes cliche.  It's a pleasant treat to watch Johansson portray a character with a bit more substance to 'the bombshell'.",

            "content": "★★★★ (out of four)\r\n\r\nWoody Allen returned to form following several disappointing films.  He shifts his focus to a more serious and intriguing picture.  \"Match Point\" is one of his darkest films without being a comedy.  It steps every so gently on the toes of Hitchcock and gives the great director a chance to try out different camera styles while still preserving his well crafted characterizations and wit.\r\n\r\nAllen takes his show on the road, moving the focus from New York to London for the first time.  Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a gifted and unfocused tennis player.  He takes a job as a tennis instructor at a wealthy club.  There he falls for the pretty and wealthy Chloe Hewett.\r\n\r\nChris enjoys climbing into a new social bracket, but his attraction to Choe's, brothers girlfriend (Scarlett Johansson) consumes him.  The deeper they fall for each other the faster his new life might disappear.\r\n\r\nAnother writing Oscar nomination greeted Woody and this film was very important in bringing the director back to the foreground of important filmmakers.\r\n\r\n[img]http://content6.flixster.com/rtmovie/32/87/32876_gal.jpg[/img]",

Perhaps the only good thing to say about this movie is that the acting is mediocre, saving it from the dreaded half-star rating. Apart from that, there is literally nothing good I can write. The soundtrack is dreadful and unfitting, clearly attempting to display some sort of desperate poetic prose but instead compelling aggravation. The plot, if it can be called that, is practically nihilistic, dully and egotistically ranting that luck and greed are the main factors in life. It's a despicable philosophy that makes for a dreadfully boring and downright stupid film.",
