Also he made it known he did not like the job he was given in the dreamland so it would have been great to see in the end Mr. Electricidad, played by non other then George Lopez, to offer Mr. Electric a teaching partnership or act on his behalf as a substitute teacher.

One of the most masterful touches is that the green screens in the background are very obvious to the eye; in this way, the film breaks the fourth-wall and offers intelligent meta-commentary on the nature of film in the process, harshly critiquing the low quality production values present in much of animated cinema. Another instance of this meta-commentary lies in the intentionally absurd dialogue, and here the film switches it's focus to the action-thriller genre, brilliantly and carefully picking apart the awful lines screenwriters offer to actors in the modern Hollywood Blockbuster. Sharkboy and Lavagirl's commentary goes deeper than just the movies however, with the tribulations that the two titular characters go through exposing the struggles experiences by all Shark-boys and Lava-girls worldwide, and it's constantly changing and often incoherent plot representing the horror of memory loss. In short, this film is masterful.",

Some say it is one of the directors lowest works, but when he's directed so many classics (And new pieces of cinema) that's a hard standard.  Maybe he just wanted to try something new for himself. He did stick with children's movies for a while (Spy Kids Franchise), so I hope he enjoyed directing them as much as I enjoyed watching them!",

The movie showed us how powerful our imagination is and how we must not let it go, no matter where life takes us. As we grow up, we start to hate life and people, so we resort to netflix and/or our idols as a source of escape.

The CGI, while bright and colourful is so conspicuous that it's fake. Unlike the other digital backlot Rodriguez-directed movie that came out in 2005, Sin City, the greenscreen looks terrible. Planet Drool isn't supposed to be real but you don't see kids on a planet, you see kids in front of a green-screen that shows a planet. There are a few really bad jokes. For instance, one of our main villains, Mr. Electric makes a few bad puns...and explains them. Batman & Robin was full of bad puns but at least we didn't have to deal with them explaining it because viewers are morons. Sharkboy and Lavagirl is terrible, yes but it wasn't really meant for me or anyone. It's a present from Robert Rodriguez to one of his kids. And it's a cute present, if a lousy movie.",

I like Robert Rodriguez and thought his first two Spy Kids movies were very enjoyable and while mediocre I actually thought the third Spy Kids film was better than this too. I will give some credit, the moral is decent if hardly original and there is some energy. But everything else falls flat.\n\nPeople might say the art direction was colourful and pleasing to the eye. Sorry, for me it was very tacky, gaudy and brash. And as for the 3D, it is actually some of the worst I've seen, it needed more clarity and sharpness and sometimes moved too fast. Also I found it distracting in alternative to enhancing. The soundtrack is rather plodding, generic and unmemorable too.\n\nThe script is absolutely awful too. Any parts that tried to be funny made me roll my eyes to be perfectly honest with you, while the story is unevenly paced and very weak and predictable. The characters are just as weak and bland too, the two main characters have their likable moments but there is little chemistry between them and the audience while the supporting characters fare even worse suffering either from being underused or overacted. Overall, the acting is very uneven and way too broad in some cases.\n\nOther disappointments are the poor pace and plodding direction from Rodriguez. So in conclusion, the result is a pretty awful, overstuffed and disappointing effort of a family film. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

It's not a great formula in terms of good filmmaking but in making box office cash, it's a decent plan. Nonetheless, the film is fun, albeit raising a lot of questions, having some noticably poor CGI here and there, bombarded with greenscreen all over, and I didn't particularly like Lautner's performance - most but not all of this is made up with its fun atmosphere and characters with a relatable childlike atmosphere to it.

As with the superior \"Spy Kids\" several years before, \"Sharkboy and Lavagirl\" works because of its INTENTIONAL cheesiness, its fun stab at interpreting children's intricate imaginations, and the inherent, humorous mockery of director Robert Rodriguez. Our main hero is a young boy who wants the simplest thing possible, the permission to dream and use his imagination, (which also happens to be the singular thing society and the educational system seeks to squash from the youngest age demographics.) Max is no loud-mouth, no smart-aleck, no \"see-I-told-you-my-dreams-were-real-now-say-sorry\" type of brat, but a quiet, \"artsy\" type who we've all met before. (Maybe we WERE him, long ago.) His two prized creations of Sharkboy and Lavagirl are always there to help despite their occasional quarrelling, and their quirky appearances and actions are, for lack of a better word, ridiculous. If they were anything else, I would have been sorely disappointed in the film. Characters become frozen into ice blocks and used as bobsleds to escape enemies; characters are attacked by electric eels and hunted down by giant electrical outlets; characters sleepwalk on queue, stop moving rollercoaster cars with their legs, shoot butterflies into each other's faces, sing rap-lullabies, and float downstream on giant chocolate-chip cookies. Childishly imaginative, unaboundedly silly. This is the type of fantasy \"The Never Ending Story\" wishes it was. However, despite a great start and even greater potential to be a classic, \"Sharkboy and Lavagirl\" ultimately is disjointed, its message of pro-imagination never fully-realized. All loose plot-threads are neatly tied by the final scene, but there is no sensible logic as to how they have been tied. In addition, as stated in the beginning of this review, much of the fanciful world of Planet Drool had been created within a computer, and the generally-bad quality of special effects detract from the fish boy and molten girl's antics. I believe the film could have been more successful if it had followed closer in the footsteps of Spy Kids: less visual blare, less moving around, less focus on getting the job done, and MORE absurd interactions between featuring flesh-and-blood actors and physical props.",
