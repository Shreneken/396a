The movie is genuinely funny, the characters are likeable, the acting is great, and the story is well written and imaginitive. The first film was also great, and I think they managed to top it with this sequel. We loved it! If you enjoy movies like A Christmas Story and Holes, give this a try. The hokey humor and non-realism (like the Space Shuttle) are intentional, and part of the storytelling. This is how a kid remembers things. A+ !",

They soon find out a group of girls have already claimed the field they soon come to a conclusion but another older baseball team tries to take the field for practice but the sandlot squad doesn't let up easy. This movie is directed by David mickey Evans who has also made Beethoven 2, 3, and 4, Radio flyer, Smitty  and also many more. I think there are way more strengths than weaknesses in this movie. This movie has a bunch of jokes fulfilling the comedy part and also has some action to keep you on your toes,This movie is good for any age. However the film isn't exactly organized because it features various changes of events, also others complain that this film doesn't really relate to the first sandlott which can be a problem to some. Although the actors do a great job in the movie which also sets the right tone. Just like bad news bears, benchwarmers and the perfect game this movie is very funny and is an all around good movie for the family to watch. I recommend this movie to any sports fans that love a little action with a lot of comedy,i rate this movie a 4 out of 5.",

The storyline for this picture is essentially the exact same as the original with little new features that make this worth viewing.  The feel is still appropriate, but the characters have less depth and are less interesting.  \n\n\"Women need a man like a fish needs a bicycle.\"\n\nI recently came across this on Netflix and decided to watch it with my daughter.  She absolutely loved it from beginning to end and was glued to it (I was so proud of her).  This is a gigantic step down from the original, but worth viewing if nothing else is available.\n\n\"Stay away from the kissing booth.\"\n\nGrade: C",
