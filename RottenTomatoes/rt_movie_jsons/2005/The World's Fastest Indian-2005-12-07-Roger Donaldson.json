It's part road trip and part sports biography as Munro, a strangely likeable but tiresome sort, overcomes countless obstacles to make his dream come true.  The story chugs along, much like his battered motorcycle, leading to a predictable but satisfying climax.  While the subject matter doesn't justify the long running time and some of the supporting cast provide wince-worthy performances, Hopkin's portrayal of the irritating neighbor from hell more than compensates for any of the film's shortcomings.",

            "content": "Movie Review - Final - \"The World's Fastest Indian\" (2006)  Written, produced, and directed by Roger Donaldson\n\n For those believing that \"coming of age\" happens in your early years, The World's Fastest Indian will cause your head to spin faster than the two wheels on the 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle, that real-life Burt Munro rode to set the land speed record on the salt flats at Bonneville Speedway. The World's Fastest Indian is based on the life of the real life New Zealand folk hero, Burt Munro. Burt Munro is magnificently portrayed by Sir Anthony Hopkins who we may know better as The Silence of the Lambs' character, Hannibal Lecter, the brilliant, forensic psychiatrist, with a taste for human meat. \n\nBurt Munro has had one dream for the better part of his 68 years on Earth. His dream is to transform his 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle, the one he bought new in 1920, into the two-wheeled bullet destined to break the land speed record at the Bonneville Speedway. His dream is his own. His only competition, himself.  The 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle has been metamorphosed, from a motorcycle having a top speed of 54 mph to one that reaches the mind bending speed of 200 mph. Burt is master tinkerer and craftsman. From broken metal pieces and parts of other motorcycles, Burt forges his own pistons. He replaces the original gears of his Indian Scout with gears from a milking machine. Any parts that do not survive are placed on the shelf marked, \"offerings to the Gods of Speed\". Little by little Burt Munro has created a monster. A monster unlike anything seen before or since. A monster not of this world.  \n\nFrom a fleeting periphery, we are teased. For much of the first half of the movie we only get occasional and momentary glances of \"the old girl\", the pet name Burt has for his beloved 1920 Indian Scout Motorcycle. This only adds to the mystique and adds a bit of suspenseful anticipation. We want to see more. We want to touch the smooth metal, hear the thunderous roar of the engine. For now, we must wait. Maybe the director doesn't want to throw audiences into full out cardiac arrest by giving us the full experience of this speed-demon \"old girl\" that Burt has lovingly metamorphosed with his own hands, for the better part of forty years. \n\nBurt Munro is loved by everyone that meets him. Even when Burt constantly wakes his neighbors each morning before dawn, revving his Indian Scout's engine, or \"borrowing\" and using kitchen knives to remove the tread from his tires so he can go faster and then forget to return them, or his morning ritual of urinating on his lemon tree, you can't help falling deeply in love with the man. His charm is self-effacing. His charm is genuine. \n\nBurt's journey to realizing his dream isn't all sunshine and lemon trees. There are scenes that begin reserved but build into a crescendo of heart pounding, mind warping excitement. The World's Fastest Indian strategically places these types of elements throughout the film giving us the feeling of riding a roller coaster or navigating whitewater rapids in a raft. Our first taste of this is when the local motorcycle thugs crash his 68th birthday party and a Burt challenges them to a race the following morning, it is then that we get an idea what \"the old girl\" may be capable of.  The entire town comes out to see the race. Even when Burt has problems starting the motorcycle and the gang looks like they will humiliate him in front of his town, Burt teaches the gang of thugs a lesson in respect. He catches up to and passes the entire gang like they were standing still. Even though Burt crashes and the thugs win the race and $100 cash, there is no denying this man and his 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle are a force to be reckoned with. There is so much adrenaline pumping you can almost hear your own heartbeat in your ears.  \n\nFrom one scene to the next this movie is a whole body experience. I could feel my heart sink when Burt has to be taken to the hospital by ambulance and the doctor treating him tells him his motorcycle days are over. Again, when he is told that nobody believes he will succeed in breaking the world speed land record. There is humor woven intricately throughout this movie gem. \n\nBurt's interactions with people in the United States seems familiar, not contrived or fantastic. The real magic begins to sizzle and pop when Burt actually gets to Bonneville Speedway, the place where he feels his life's dream will come to fruition. I could feel tears of happiness welling up as Burt first lays eyes on Bonneville Speedway. But as is with anything, there are setbacks. He learns that he has missed the registration for entering his 1920 Indian Scout for the year's time trials. He is also told that his motorcycle does not have the appropriate safety equipment and is therefore not allowed to compete. This is the first time Burt Munro seems like he may have a breakdown. Burt Munro doggedly appeals to fellow speed-freak Jim Moffet. Race officials are convinced to humor the old guy that traveled from half a world away to realize his dream. I could feel my heart soar and my tears joyously flow, as Burt Munro is finally able to see exactly what \"the old girl\" is capable of. Burt Munro is allowed, by race officials, to race his beloved 1920 Indian Scout Motorcycle, the one he bought new in 1920, on the Bonneville Salt Flats. His dream soon becomes a reality.\n\nOn his first timed run in August 1962, Burt Munro set the land speed record at 201.852 mph. Burt traveled to Bonneville Speedway a total of nine times. He set three world records. His 1967 record still stands.While the movie does take some liberties with his actual speed. This is of little consequence to me. This movie is a masterpiece. It will set your soul on fire. \n\n \n\nThere is nothing in this world that can stop a man when he sets sights on making his lifelong dream a reality. Burt Munro refused to resign himself to the rocking chair of old age. For Burt Munro understands that even those living, in the golden sunset of advancing age, have the ability to change the world. For age is an arbitrary number. Some people are content with spending their golden years as an audience to passing time. For Burt Munro, time takes a step back and salutes The World's Fastest Indian. These are just some of the elements woven throughout The World's Fastest Indian, that even in 2017, eleven years after its release that makes it an important and timeless classic.\n\n \n\nThe World's Fastest Indian was filmed in New Zealand, Utah's West Desert, and the salt flats of Bonneville Speedway.\n\n \n\n.",

Based on the story of a New Zealand motorcyclist Burt Munro. After spending 25 years to build a faster motorbike in the down under, now a very old Munro travel halfway across the earth to Bonneville speedway in the US to set a record. So what's the remaining of the tale reveals is that does his dream becomes reality or not.\n\nAwesome performance by Anthony Hopkins, but in some parts I was distracted by his fake Kiwi accent. Overall, not bad with his effort, he achieved the goal conveniently. It is one of the best road movie that directed by the 'Species' filmmaker. The 120 minutes was too short, but well covered story with inclusion of messages like anti smoking and alcohol consumption.\n\nIt is a decade old film, never too late to watch a fine film like this, but inside I feel regret for the delay. I had no idea about the storyline. I thought it might be about Indians and then thought American Indians, but realised only while watching it that it is about a motorbike called Indian. It is surely a good family movie, especially if there is a motorbike maniac in the house. Highly recommended by me.\n\n9/10",

So, if anyone could do a movie about this interesting character, it's him.  I have to warn you, this is a difficult movie to get.  It's not on TV, there's not many DVDs here in the States and it's pretty much dropped off the face of the planet.  So, if you see this anywhere, be sure to view it if you get the opportunity.  You won't regret it.\n\nBurt Munro (Anthony Hopkins) is an elderly Kiwi who tinkers with his 1920s Indian motorcycle, continually modifying it to go ever faster.  He melts down metal to mold replacement pistons and uses unusual parts that he finds to make a 50 MPH vintage motorcycle go over 150 MPH.  His dream is to travel to America and take it on speed trials at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, USA.\n\nWhen Burt suffers a heart attack, he takes the plunge, mortgaging his property, to make his dream a reality.  Burt Munro is an interesting character all by himself, but he meets so many other interesting people along his way, that you never get bored with this film.  Also, it's hard to believe that he will accomplish what he sets out for, there is so much going against him.  He is just so determined and is able to talk his way into anything.  Plus the Kiwi way of making stuff work with what you can find.\n\nThe DVD doesn't have closed captioning (only Spanish subtitles), but it does include Donaldson's earlier documentary, so you realize how close Anthony Hopkins was to portraying Burt Monro.",

            "content": "Roger Donaldson's biopic of Burt Munro, a cranky old Kiwi who still holds a land speed record set on a customised 1920s Indian scout, has charm and sentiment shovelled on in spades, but is still a fun and uplifting film, despite the creaks and groans. Hopkins is a bit ridiculous in places, but manages to convey Munro's grit and determination, and cheeky young at heart spirit. As I was watching, I realised how rare it is to see a film about, well old people, especially not acting their age as we perceive it. Munro befriends a transvestite with no prejudice, has a ladyfriend back home but still ends up in a rural American widows bed and thwarts some of the bureaucrats at Bonneville speed week through a mixture of charm and stubborn disobedience. It's definitely a feel good movie, there's never quite the sense of life or death danger on the bike and despite some health scares it's clear from the tone of the film that Munro won't suffer any tragic fate and will overcome the odds to succeed in his dream. Sometimes a simple success story is enough though.",
