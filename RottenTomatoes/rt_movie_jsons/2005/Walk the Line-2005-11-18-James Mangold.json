While on tour, Cash meets the love of his life, singer June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), but Cash's volatile lifestyle threatens to keep them apart.",

            "content": "With excellent acting, enjoyable music, and a solid plot, Walk the Line is definitely in the top-tier of musician biopics. Sure, I'm biased, as Joaquin Phoenix is my favorite actor, but he's perfect as Johnny Cash — Witherspoon as June Carter, Cash's longtime touring partner, and eventual wife, is also a perfect casting. Growing up in poverty, daddy issues, life on the road, drug addiction, it's all there. The circular plot — beginning and ending in Folsom Prison — was an excellent directorial decision. I loved the prison scenes, especially the \"poker chips\" (at least that's what it sounded like to me) that you couldn't see but added an indescribable something to the moment. Cash's father, Ray (Robert Patrick), is such a bastard you tighten up whenever he enters the picture. The \"Thanksgiving\" scene was butthole-clenching tense and ended not how you'd expect. That's something I also appreciated about the relationship between Johnny and Ray, we never got that \"proud of you, son\" moment the former so desperately wanted, fished for even (re: the house on the lake), from his father, and I appreciated that. Movies can resemble real-life instead of movies, sometimes. Besides these two scenes, the other most notable was when Johnny and his band perform for the first time in front of the record producer (Dallas Roberts). Not feeling what they were putting out, Sam Philips (Roberts) tells 'em to cut the shit and play something with more soul — Johnny takes the opportunity to play Cry, Cry, Cry, a song his bandmates don't even know; the rest is history. I enjoy Cash's music but don't know his full oeuvre, so I'll assume he stayed true to his roots, through and through, and never went \"electric\". Walk the Line is a must-see for music-history buffs — we get glimpses of Elvis (Tyler Hilton), Waylon Jennings (Shooter Jennings), and Roy Orbison (Jonathon Rice) — and is a great watch for everyone else.",

The story is powerful and moving, though I don't think that it tells the entire story of Johnny Cash and leaves out some of the later parts of his life. The chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon is very well, and they sing their parts very well. I do feel like the movie begins rushing in the last act once the two main characters have started dating. I feel like the film could have spent a little more time on that and what happened after their eventual marriage. However, this film is still done phenomenally and Mangold's directing style helps to make this movie stand out.",

            "content": "\"Walk The Line\" is a fantastic movie, which, unfortunately, came out in the same year as \"Ray\", in which Jamie Foxx did a little better than Joaquin Phoenix in terms of portraying an assigned musician. If this film came out a year earlier or a year later, it could have gotten an Oscar for best picture, in my opinion. Joaquin Phoenix is a perfect cast for Johnny Cash, as he portrays nearly everything from him perfectly, starting from the moves and finishing with singing. There are not many actors who have actually sang in their movies while portraying the musicians and seeing Joaquin Phoenix doing everything by himself is very pleasing. The aesthetic of the time during the film is beautiful, all the shots are clean, costumes are well done and everything looks like if it was filmed without a single decoration, rather just filmed in the original locations. The supporting cast is also great, as they do their jobs great in providing emotions, especially the actress that played June Carter, as everything she did could have been well thought. The plot is basic for a musician drama, but it should have been like that, although it does its job as being drama perfectly and the entire movie is interesting to watch. It is a biography, so it should have been close to what was happening in real life and the movie did just that. Fantastic Joaquin Phoenix, fantastic plot, fantastic Johnny Cash, 9/10, a forgotten must-watch.",

Also of note is Ginnifer Goodwin in a subtle but powerful performance as Cash's first wife, Vivian Cash.  The music, as would be expected, is great and the live performances resonate with authenticity.  The film will obviously appeal primarily to fans of Cash, but fans won't learn anything new or gain any fresh insight into the music icon as Cash does not come across as the complex character he was in real life.  Despite the movie becoming a bit sluggish over the second half, most notably during his drug and alcohol abuse period, it is worth checking out for the performances and the tunes.",

The  beginning of this movie sucks aka the big flashback. Yes I know it's a big part of who Johnny cash is but I didn't care for it. Even when Johnny is in the army and is marrying his first wife is boring. Where the movie starts for me is when he is singing for his first record. The chemistry between Johnny cash and Reese Witherspoons character I forgot her name are both really good. Every time they were on screen together it is magical. They both deserve Oscars for their performances but what stands in there way of achieving that is the pacing in the film. At times this movie feels way too long but then the pace is perfect. And that is a major downgrade for this movie. Yes I know that those parts are to support the story but as a movie it's boring but as a story book it makes sense. Nonetheless this is a great movie. I didn't know anything about Johnny cash before this movie and know I'm a fan. The music is phenomenal and 1000 percent the best part of this movie. It's great to see that Joaquin Phoenix did his own spin on it and he pulled a taron edgerton in the movie rocketman. And this is a hot take but I prefer Joaquin Phoenixs version of Johnny cash's songs than Johnny cash's songs themselves. I know that sounds weird but everything's weird. In the end I highly recommend this movie, it's not just a movie it was an experience to see the highs and lows of the icon Johnny cash.",

            "content": "Musical biopics usually get a bad rap and this film is one of the main influences on the parody film Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (2007) which makes it partially responsible for abominations like Bohemian Rhapsody (2018). This film does manage to, at moments, rise above the conventions of the genre it is working in however as the actors give spirited performances and the musical numbers are actually impressive. Director James Mangold is possibly more known now for his work on Logan (2017) and Knight and Day (2010) but he does a decent job here at piecing together a coherent story. I don't think that this is one of the best films of the 2000s or even 2005 but it may be one of the best traditional music biopics ever released.\n\nJohnny Cash, Joaquin Phoenix, had a difficult childhood as his brother died in a horrific accident and he was distant from his father who viewed him as a failure. He becomes a successful musician after leaving the army, marrying his childhood sweetheart Vivian, Ginnifer Goodwin, and discovering he can play the guitar well. His success comes at a cost as he and Vivian become estranged and his attempts to begin an affair with June Carter, Reese Witherspoon, are largely unsuccessful due to his addiction to pills and her Christian guilt. He spirals out of control but is able to get back on his feet after divorcing Vivian and beginning a relationship with June while he goes through rehabilitation.\n\nThe moments in the film that make you cringe often come at the points in which Cash is inspired to write a song or Carter unleashes some of her humor onstage. When she tells him \"You can't walk that line\" we know exactly what's coming and we wish that there was at least one scene in which a song was written in a way that felt at least slightly realistic. Carter's jokes aren't all that funny and although they are meant to make us like her they make they make me think the screenwriter was either doing a poor job of conveying the wit that the real Carter supposedly had or that Carter herself was not particularly funny. Were these moments to be taken out the film would be missing some essential elements as we do need to engage with Cash's music and see what made him fall in love with Carter but I wish these things had been done with more grace.\n\nAs for the performances they are just OK. Witherspoon does not match Sissy Spacek in Coal Miner's Daughter or even Jessica Lange in Sweet Dreams (1985) but her Southern twang and sharp features are enough to get her along. I would have given Best Actress to Charlize Theron in North Country (2005) who is doing a lot more with a unique role than Witherspoon does with her paint my numbers performance. Phoenix fares slightly better as Cash but his self destructive artist who wants to be better for the woman he loves act has been done better on screen by Robert Duvall in Tender Mercies (1983). All of the supporting players feel like they could have dropped in from filming a Hallmark TV movie and their alarm at every action either Cash or Carter takes makes it hard to believe them as real people.\n\nThe best parts of the film come when Cash and/or Carter are performing onstage as the songs are great and Phoenix and Witherspoon are actually decent musical performers. We get to see all of the classics get played and Phoenix's assured performance up on stage convinces us of the character and his talents. This is also where the chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon is most palpable as they have a nice rapport and the proposal scene is arguably the best five minutes in the film alone.\n\nThis is a passable film but it doesn't reach the heights of other films about musicians like Bird (1988) and Georgia (1995). I would say that you should watch other biopics about musicians before seeing this one but there are not many that I would recommend so I suppose I am left saying that this is one of the best in the genre.",

            "content": "A mesmerizing depiction of a country legend.\n\nJames Mangold's biopic on Johnny Cash, Walk the Line (2005) is a completely engaging piece of art. I'm not even a huge country music fan, though I deeply respect Johnny Cash, and I was totally enamored by Walk the Line. Every second is engrossing as a dramatic picture with lovely musical numbers.\n\nWalk the Line breathes new life into the legacy of the music icon Johnny Cash. Watching the origins of Folsom Prison Blues, I Walk the Line, Ring of Fire, and other Cash classics is magical. The down to Earth style of Cash is endearing on his own, but witnessed through Walk the Line captures a passionate realism that only Cash conjured through his beautifully harrowing songs. Needless to say, Walk the Line's soundtrack is a greatest hits selection of Johnny Cash songs you need to hear to know the man's career.\n\nFurthermore, James Mangold's direction is stunning. Perfect framing of conversations and encounters between Johnny Cash and his father, June Carter Cash, and other musical figures. Mangold's style is sleek and classic with a nod to gritty realism of Cash's lyrics and lifestyle. The performances are lively and mystifying with an enchanting quality to them. Mangold makes this 2 hour movie feel like a breeze with his careful direction.\n\nWalk the Line features many neat cameos and supporting roles appearing throughout the film. Walk the Line includes Buddy Holly, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Waylon Jennings, and of course June Carter. It's amazing to think about how many excellent musicians Johnny Cash played with or alongside throughout his miraculous career. Walk the Line brings them all to life with a neat respect and fun personality.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix is the real star here as Johnny Cash himself. His thick accent and gravelly voice fit Cash perfectly. He becomes Cash so much so that you forget you are watching an actor perform his craft. Phoenix has mastered the art of becoming as he transforms into Cash in look, voice, body language, and singing. Phoenix has to be seen to be believed. I appreciate Joaquin Phoenix taking a more subtle nuanced portrayal of Johnny Cash as a tortured miserable man desperate for love. Phoenix contorts his figure and heart for the role with a tender depth and reverence for Cash that is apparent.\n\nLikewise, Reese Witherspoon gives a fantastic performance as June Carter Cash. Her willful spirit and tough attitude meet Reese's sweet personality and heavenly voice. I think her chemistry with Phoenix is palpable as they play lovers so realistically. I think Walk the Line is easily one of Reese Witherspoon's best performances. She walks, talks, and sings like June Carter Cash in a genuinely astonishing role. She is Phoenix' foil as well as love interest as she commands attention and gives the audience everything she has to offer. Witherspoon is simply outstanding!\n\nI should mention Ginnifer Goodwin's portrayal of Johnny Cash's first wife is terrifying and sad. I loved her in Walk the Line. On the other hand, you despise Robert Patrick as Cash's father for his harsh brutal ways. Patrick gives his greatest acting in Walk the Line, hands down.\n\nWatch Walk the Line for its masterful direction from James Mangold alone. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are a bonus to this wonderful film.",

She nails every single scene she's in. It's definitely the best part of the movie. Joaquin Phoenix (Johnny Cash) more than holds his own, also giving a great performance. You can tell he studied enough of Cash, yet managed to put his own spin on it. Their relationship is the driving force behind the movie and their courtship is handled well. Their chemistry is great. Ginnifer Goodwin (Vivian Cash) is also very strong in a supporting role. The music in this is very good. Doing your own singing when you're playing such iconic people is a daunting task but they pull it off well. I also appreciated how much emotion this entire story elicits. \n\nWeaknesses: While I enjoyed the courtship of Johnny and June, their actual relationship didn't work for me. It came across as Johnny being terrible for her and her not really wanting any part of it. There was a similar dynamic in A Star is Born, but it worked way better there. Here, when Johnny keeps asking her to marry him, I just kept wanting her to say no. It's also a paint-by-numbers biopic where nothing really happens to make it special. The two plus hour runtime is a bit rough to get through at points.\n\nOverall: The relationship that drives the movie has severe issues and it hurts the plot. But Witherspoon and Phoenix are so great in the roles that it crosses over into recommended territory.",

Sadly, I was disappointed by the film because it was a fairly standard addiction drama, about a recording artist that overindulged in drinking and drugs to the detriment of his personal life. It’s told well with some powerful scenes and great cinematic moments. Unfortunately, I found the connection between Cash and Carter at the heart of the film to be a bit flimsy, perhaps because I didn’t sense much chemistry between Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. I preferred the underlying story of a broken man that was trained to view himself as worthless much more, and I wish the film centered entirely on the relationship with his father. Resolution there had more potential for catharsis than the romantic relationship. I also have some frustration with any romantic relationship that starts as an affair, because it always seems thoroughly unromantic to me and puts a damper on any future attempts to warm my heart. I think Walk the Line could have won me over completely if they had more Johnny Cash music. There are several scenes on stage, and a few songs we get in their entirety, but it seems there are a number of shorter snippets. I would have enjoyed it more if there was a tie between plot details and the songs that accompanied them, but they didn’t go that way either. And, to be honest, Phoenix doesn’t have the same commanding bass sound that makes Cash special. There was always enough to keep me engaged in this film, but never enough to get me excited about what I was watching. That’s a shame because the actors all did a good job, the director had a vision that was impactful, and there are enough twists and turns in the true story to make a great film. But choices were made that didn’t click for me and set this apart from other films that tackle similar topics. I wonder if my expectations were elevated too high. Luckily, I already own a copy of Walk the Line, so I will watch it again sometime and it might impress me more with adjusted expectations.",

Joaquin Phoenix is stunning on his portrayal of Johnny Cash and is supported nicely by Reese Witherspoon throughout the course of the feature.

After his music career took off surprisingly well, Johnny Cash hit rock bottom financially, emotionally, jobless, and without his family due to immense addictions. But failure never stopped the inspirational man to turn his rebellious ways into humble actions. Joaquin Pheonix exquisitely portrayed Johnny Cash's beginning and ending with everything in between. Pheonix was able to bring the smooth, deep voice and trademark guitar strum back to life in Walk the Line. Johnny's love of his life, June Carter, was played by the incredible Reese Witherspoon, whom won the Best Actress Award due to this role. Witherspoon exceeded her task of portraying June by showing the tremendous amount of compassion and love June changed Johnny's life with. The two actors perfectly represented the unstoppable duo Johnny and June were.

The movie hits all of the beats you expect from the genre: it builds in the first act, the characters hit their low points around the midpoint into the end of the second act, and then rebound in the final third to wrap it all up. And yet, what Mangold has crafted here works so well despite being so familiar. The key to any biopic is the actor playing the lead character, and Walk the Line delivers in that regard with Joaquin Phoenix's masterful performance as Johnny Cash. For what he lacks in physical similarity to Cash, Phoenix completely embodies his soul, especially when it comes to the scenes where he performs musical numbers. Phoenix's vocal cadence is so eerily similar to Cash's, almost to the point where you're convinced that Phoenix is simply being dubbed by original recordings of Cash. In the quieter scenes, Phoenix infuses a quiet charm to Cash, and makes him into a compelling protagonist for all of his shortcomings. Alongside him is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, who delivers what may be the best performance of her career. Witherspoon is rather charming as well, with an extroverted Southern charisma that complements Cash's quieter character quite nicely. Mangold deserves some credit as well, not only for getting two wonderful performances out of Phoenix and Witherspoon, but for crafting a 136 minute film that stays interesting throughout without having to resort to any fancy stylistic choices that could otherwise be distracting. Fans of Cash and newcomers to his music (if those somehow exist) should both find a lot to enjoy with the endless charm of Walk the Line.",

Even when Johnny is in the army and is marrying his first wife is boring. Where the movie starts for me is when he is singing for his first record. The chemistry between Johnny cash and Reese Witherspoons character I forgot her name are both really good. Every time they were on screen together it is magical. They both deserve Oscars for their performances but what stands in there way of achieving that is the pacing in the film. At times this movie feels way too long but then the pace is perfect.

I didn’t know anything about Johnny cash before this movie and know I’m a fan. The music is phenomenal and 1000 percent the best part of this movie. It’s great to see that Joaquin Phoenix did his own spin on it and he pulled a taron edgerton in the movie rocketman. And this is a hot take but I prefer Joaquin Phoenixs version of Johnny cash’s songs than Johnny cash’s songs themselves. I know that sounds weird but everything’s weird. In the end I highly recommend this movie, it’s not just a movie it was an experience to see the highs and lows of the icon Johnny cash.",

            "content": "Bolstered by strong work from Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon and Ginnifer Goodwin (in a performance destined to be underrated even if it's not), Walk the Line is a sturdy bio-pic that probes the behavior and distinct singing of Johnny Cash and his topsy-turvy relationship with June Carter. Phoenix and Witherspoon are so great together, they bolster the film's occasional lapses into repetition. While Witherspoon most definitely deserved her Oscar for Best Actress in a vivid and charming performance as Carter (despite her lead role almost being pushed more towards supporting), Joaquin Phoenix also deserved his nomination and if Philip Seymour Hoffman hadn't have been so darn good in \"Capote\", this would be his award. The music and the performances, mixed in with some intense flares of drama turn this bio-pic into a memorable one. Rating: 81",

Superbly acted with a great story full of substance.  This movie is not only about Johnny Cash and his music career, but also about how someone with the help of the people that love him can lift themselves up and become who they were meant to be.  I am a Johnny Cash fan, I became a huge fan after this movie.   Not just of his music but of the man himself.  I for one never knew that Johnny Cash had a devastating drug addiction that almost derailed his entire career.  this is by far Joaquin Pheonixs' performance of his career, superb.",

            "content": "Movie Review: Walk the Line\n\tNot every movie has the ability to capture a viewer's attention, yet it's even harder to find a movie that changes the way its audience feels about particular life views.  Walk the Line captured my heart and also gave me a sense of knowing that I'm not the only one. It changed my views on life. Before watching this movie, I felt alone and like no one would ever understand how I was feeling in my situation. After watching Walk the Line, everything happens for a reason and that this is what would later shape the person I would become today. I would either give up by letting my misery consume me, or I wouldn't let everyone else's mistakes become mine. I learned to let go of those feelings and become determined to follow my own path. Having felt this way, Walk the Line is a very relatable and entertaining movie that also includes a historical view on life in that time period.\n\tAs a youth going through tough times myself, I felt a bond with the Johnny Cash portrayed in Walk the Line. Cash's childhood involved an abusive, drunken father, but he found a way through it all. Cash became mesmerized with music, specifically the Carter family's, during his troubled youth. Music seems to be an outlet for anyone now, to just let out whatever and still be accepted by society. At first, Johnny had a hard time getting anyone to listen to his music because his songs were too personal. Johnny later changed his style to the one everyone now knows.\n\tEnjoying a movie isn't always about how well it was put together, or who plays in it. This movie is entertaining because it's relatable, yet also a historical piece about Johnny's life. An enjoyable movie can also pull heart strings, or give someone closure.  The actors involved really set the standard for this movie. No one could have made a better June Carter than the comical Reese Witherspoon. Director James Mangold wrote the script alongside Gill Dennis, and they both did a terrific job with the story line. At times it seemed like it wasn't centered on Johnny, but rather June and how Johnny affected her life. However, the turning point of Johnny's life does revolve around June and her family. June and her family moved into Johnny's house so they could all take care of him and help him fight his addictions. The mood and the storyline of this biopic is depressing. Throughout the movie, there were times where Johnny became desperate and didn't know what to do. Thanks to June, this movie just goes to show you that caring about someone goes a long way in the end. June attempted many times to keep Johnny away from drugs and alcohol.\n\tJohnny's whole life is a historical event. He greatly impacted everyone around him and they did the same to him. When Johnny and June were children, they grew up in the great depression. The Carter family was the original country music family in there time. June grew up in the family business, but Johnny wanted to get away from anything reminding him of his painful youth. He wanted to follow the only thing that was always there to rescue him, music. Johnny wanted to give back to everyone, and he was phenomenal. Surprisingly, Johnny started out playing gospel music, not the country style that everyone loved so much. Johnny's songs were everything that everyone needed, and also what they wanted. His music inspired many people of different cultures. A lot of people value him, and also the impact he made on society as a hole.\n\tJohnny's music made a huge impact on society. Music made him relatable to everyone who listened. This movie reveals the history behind the legend, and how Johnny's life was not so different from a lot of people. In my opinion, his story is more relatable and heartfelt than others. This is a great movie that appeals to me personally because I can relate to a historical figure, his life, and his music. This movie captures the audience's attention in a way that appeals to the intended viewer. Walk the Line is influential and can change the way you view something in your own life, or it can also give you closure by knowing someone had it worse. If you have never heard Johnny Cash's life story, I would definitely suggest this movie to anyone wanting to know more about him.",
