            "content": "This is a good underdog film. Russell Crowe, Paul Giamatti and Renee Zellweger give solid performances. The film is long and can feel slow in some places but the boxing scenes alone make up for this. Every punch feels real and Crowe's acting makes you feel his characters pain with each hit he takes. Worth watching if you enjoy boxing films or true history stories.",

I guess if he had left his wife blown the money and ended up in the gutter the critics would have liked it more.  He bought a home with the prize money raised his family not far from where he grew up.  Great job in real life and in the movie.",

            "content": "Cinderella Man is a truly terrific movie that captures the essence of the Great Depression in the United States and the resilience of the human spirit. Directed by Ron Howard and starring Russell Crowe as the main protagonist, James J. Braddock, the film tells the story of a struggling boxer who rises from poverty to become a champion, giving hope to a nation that was going through tough times.\n\nOne of the reasons why this movie is so powerful is because of its attention to historical detail. The movie is set during the Great Depression, and the filmmakers have done an excellent job of capturing the look and feel of that time period. From the clothes and hairstyles to the sets and props, everything feels authentic and real. The movie also captures the desperation and poverty that so many people were experiencing during that time, and it shows how Braddock's success as a boxer gave hope to people who had lost everything.\n\nRussell Crowe delivers an outstanding performance as James J. Braddock, portraying him as a humble and determined man who refuses to give up in the face of adversity. His transformation from a washed-up boxer to a champion is both inspiring and heart-warming, and it's impossible not to root for him throughout the movie. The supporting cast is also excellent, with standout performances from Ren\u00e9e Zellweger as Braddock's wife Mae and Paul Giamatti as his trainer Joe Gould.\n\nAnother reason why Cinderella Man is such a terrific movie is its message of perseverance and hope. Despite the hardships that Braddock faces, he never gives up on his dreams, and his success serves as a beacon of hope to those around him. The movie reminds us that even in the darkest of times, there is always a glimmer of hope, and that we can overcome even the toughest obstacles if we stay true to ourselves and never give up.\n\nIn conclusion, Cinderella Man is a movie that is both inspiring and entertaining, with outstanding performances, attention to historical detail, and a powerful message of hope and perseverance. It's a movie that everyone should watch, not just for its entertainment value, but also for its reminder of the strength of the human spirit.",

Russell Crowe's performance as a man just trying make ends meet in an ever-frustrating Great Depression hits you in heart as hard as these boxer's swung. \n\nThe plot's a bit predictable, yeah, it's a sports movie after all. I also understand that it was far overdramatized with it's creative liberties of actual events, but it's a movie that works. The lead role, the set design, the emotion is just so raw that it makes for just a fantastic movie.",

            "content": "This is a tale of a somewhat down and out boxer (Jim Braddock) struggling to maintain a semi-decent home life for his family in the late 1920s onwards. Its undoubtedly a bleak watch at times but I liked seeing how James Braddock reacted to things, criticism by others and how he clearly loved his children and did all he could to provide for his family.\n\nThe film title refers to the nickname he was given, as he managed to regain his former glory but the question is, of course, at what cost?. I remember one character also made the point that (in relation to his nickname) \"people die in fairy tales all the time\".\n\nCertainly this film highlights that the serious effects of concussion were at least starting to be noticed back in the time its set in, with other competitors knocking people out, who didn't recover. That made me think of the more recent film 'Concussion' with Will Smith, which goes into this subject more deeply, although in that film its directly related to American Football, rather than boxing.\n\nI felt Renee Zellweger gave a particularly good performance in this film, as Mae Braddock, who clearly was deeply concerned for the health and future of her husband and father to her children. I doubt many people couldn't feel her concern and frustration for him through Renee's performance.\n\nOverall this is an interesting sport related biopic/drama film. I wouldn't say its especially memorable but Russell Crowe is on good form and I'd say its certainly worth a watch, so yes, I would recommend it.",

            "content": "Ron Howard's darkest and most depressing film, yet inspiring by the end.\n\nRon Howard's historical drama Cinderella Man (2005) is an inspiring boxing biopic about James J. Braddock demonstrating Howard's absolute empathy for a poor man pushed to his limit who does not give up. Russell Crowe portrays \"Cinderella Man\" James J. Braddock, who inspires the nation when America needed it most during The Great Depression. Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman's story and script fill you with American pride and motivation. Their words are heartfelt and subtle with earnest pleas for the plight of the impoverished and disenfranchised.\n\nHoward incredibly recreates America during 1929-1935 with astonishing detail from his production designers Wynn Thomas, Peter Grundy, Dan Yarhi. Howard's view of America during The Great Depression is bleak making this film a harrowing watch. However, Cinderella Man is uplifting as you see a desperate fight to feed his family in a genuinely moving picture about a heroic Depression era pugilist.\n\nRussell Crowe finds real heart in depicting James J. Braddock. His perseverance of will and dedication to his family make Braddock very likable. You want to root for the underdog, but Crowe truly invests you in this man of little luck and devastating circumstances. His accent, mannerisms, body language, and fighting stance all change in a revelation of acting for Cinderella Man. Crowe has wonderful chemistry with the eternal beauty and kind-hearted Ren\u00e9e Zellweger as James J. Braddock's long suffering wife Mae Braddock. Her patience, bravery, desperation, uncertainty, and love are all apparent from Zellweger's humanistic performance. I just adore Zellweger and she is remarkably convincing in these period dramas.\n\nI really enjoy Paul Giamatti screaming out encouraging coaching advice as Joe Gould. I could watch him yell supportive statements at Crowe for 9 hours if that's all Cinderella Man was, but he's very affectionate and real alongside Russell Crowe. Craig Bierko is monstrous as the behemoth boxer Max Baer. His brutality and stature precede his shocking behavior. Paddy Considine is likable as Braddock's dock friend Mike Wilson. You despise Bruce McGill as boxing magnate Jimmy Johnston. Rance Howard and Clint Howard get neat cameos as an announcer and referee too because Ron Howard is such a kind family man.\n\nRon Howard's direction is peerless and impressive as ever. He clearly gives you the facts of Braddock's life, yet depicts his unreal tragedies and triumphs with a sympathetic eye. Howard directs movies to make you cry and appreciate all you have in life. Cinderella Man has stayed with me ever since I first saw it. Revisiting it has been just as inspiring. It's 144 minutes of brutal Depression era suffering resulting in an astonishing underdog story. Every boxing match is intense, fast, and exciting up there with Rocky and Raging Bull's fights. Ron Howard continues to deliver excellent filmmaking with creative storytelling with his influential auteur style.\n\nI love how masterful Howard's direction is on a technical level. Slowing down a shot for a brief moment to make punches more dramatic. Anthony J. Ciccolini III and Tony Volante's sound choices are incredible as every punch sounds like a brick hitting Crowe. The punches sound realistic, but heavy. The rapid fire hits to the stomach and head reverberates in your head like an earthquake. Daniel P. Hanley and Mike Hill's editing cuts you from blow to blow with professional precision. Everything is sleek and mature with gentle conversations with few cuts and thrilling boxing matches flying by in brief moments.\n\nSalvatore Totino's cinematography is gorgeous with wide shots outside and stunning close-ups for intimate moments. His slick camera pans around the ring are as cool as his shots under the fighters' head and guts for quick flurries of punches. All the dark moody lighting is impressive on its own merits too. Ron Howard uses the camera to convey to audiences that you can improve and you should feel sympathy for boxers' wives. Cinderella Man is pure classic boxing cinema.\n\nThomas Newman's score is really understated and mature. His composition for Cinderella Man is subtle and cushions hard times with soft symphonies of sympathy. Daniel Orlandi's costumes look period accurate and fit effortlessly into The Depression Era in dock hand clothes, boxing uniforms, and post-flapper dresses. I'm very impressed by Burton J. LeBlanc and David LeRoy Anderson's breathtaking and rough make-up that looks like the boxers actually were hurt.\n\nIn all, Cinderella Man is a magnificent display of filmmaking prowess and knowledge from iconic American director Ron Howard. With legendary performances from Crowe and Zellweger, how can you not be touched by Cinderella Man's inspiring story? Watch Cinderella Man and be amazed.",

This movie offers some of the greatest implied messages of being a man and fighting for your family and what you believe in. Russell Crowe did not falter in portraying the unbreakable determination that this fighter had. I was definitely entranced by how steadfast he was, how he didn't back down, and how  it seemed like he could read his opponents like a book.\nHaddock had certainly fell to a miserable low but still forced himself to beg his peers when it came to his kids. His endurance through working at the docks with a broken hand transferred into a brand new strength for him back in the ring. Haddock was portrayed as always being kind and never letting people get to him. One of the most captivating moments was the final fight against Baer. A remarkable match between a kind warrior and a blood-lusting brawler. To witness the most intense part of that battle, one could believe Haddock must have been one of the bravest men in the world.",

Crowe is really quite good in the lead role, as is Paul Giamatti as his manager.  The final half hour of this film, which is the fight against Baer, is really quite thrilling.  The problem is that it takes two hours to get there, and that's an hour too long.  This is a fairly straightforward riches to rags to riches story, yet we spend a lot of time in the rags portion bludgeoning the same few themes to brutal death.

He puts a lot of focus talking about the way that Braddock handles himself and his family throughout the Great Depression and through the ups and downs of his boxing career.  David also talks about how much historical value is in the movie and how they add actual events in the movie like the guy that leaves his wife and kids because life gets to hard during the great depression.  Shows how hard life was like during that time period and how everyone had to work there butts off the survive the events.  \nCinderella Man. Dir. Ron Howard. Pref. Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, Paul Giamatti, Craig    \nBierko, and Paddy Considine. Universal Pictures. 2005. DVD. \nJames J. Braddock is a boxer from New Jersey that is a fading star in the boxing world, caused by a broken hand.  His wife Mea is kinda relieved that her husband can't fight anymore but she is sad and worried because she knows they can't live without his boxing income since they are in the middle of the great depression.  James has to go to work on the docks loading and unloading ships to make ends meet to feed him and his family.   Then out of nowhere a boxer gets a cancellation on a boxer a couple nights before the fight, James lifelong friend and manager gets him the fight because it is granted money.  The only problem is that James now has to fight the number 2 boxer in the world and james hasn't been training in months and is unprepared.  The underdog James Braddock ends up winning the match in the 3rd round.  Fight has been waiting for, James is going to fight Max Baer.  The world champion.  His wife doesn't want james to fight because Max Baer has killed people in the ring by punching them so hard.  Braddock is a man that comes up from the ashes and streets of the great depression to fight the best boxer in the world, everyone starts to look up to him.  The people call him \"Cinderella Man\" going into the fight. Cinderella Man wins the fight in one of the biggest upsets in the boxing world.  Braddock lost the next to fights so he retired from boxing and ran heavy equipment on the docks where he used to work.  Mae and james bought a house with james boxing money and lived there the rest of their lives.\nEbert, Roger. Cinderella Man-2005. Rogeregbert.com. 2005. Web. \nThe movie is about James Braddock a boxer that goes from riches to rags multiple time but manages to keep his head up and be kind warm hearted man throughout the progress.  The movie brings a great uplifting story that no one seen coming.  It is an excellent movie for people who need a heart warming movie or a uplifting movie.  \nSome people argue that James Braddock the main actor did not hold his composure during the bad times of his life.  He doesn't always tell his wife the truth about what he is doing to make money.  He gets a little loud and over the top in some moments of the movie but you have to put yourself in his shoes and his point of view.  Everything he doesn't tell his wife about benefits her in the long run.  The points he gets mad at her is justified and expected because she makes decisions about their children without communicating with him before she did it.\nJames Braddock is a very inspiring and motivation man throughout his life and in the movie. This is a secondary source because it is coming from a movie review and not from someone like the director or any of the actors.  \nMS. \"Cinderella Man.\" Timeout.com. 6 Sept. 2005.  Timeout.com web. 31 Jan. 2018.\nAmazing looking at how much not just James Braddock had to overcome and what he had to do to survive but the whole generation was in the same boat.  He had to scrape the bottom of the barrel to get every penny he earned to take care of him and his family.  It's incredible that they could not even afford meat to be on the table or any food for that matter.  James was shown giving up his food to his daughter who said she was still hungry after eating her own breakfast.  This reveiws talks a lot about his life as much as they talk about the boxing and come back side to this movie. The director does a fantastic job of making people feel sad and feel bad about the people in the books situations.  Really talks about family morals and how a family should be and how parent should look out for their kids.  \nYoars, Marcus. \"Cinderella Man.\" pluggedin.com.  Pluggedin.com web. 31 jan. 2018.\nYoars was super sticked on his review giving Cinderella man only two out of five stars.  He says that the story line and the ending was too predictable to catch the watchers off guard.  He says but what did surprise him is all of the facts about him home life like being able to stay with his family and being able to do anything to keep his kids and provide for all of them, even if it meant going hungry himself.  How crazy it is that his wife Mae will not attend any of James fights because she says that every time he gets punched it feels like she is getting punched too.  She doesn't even listen to it on the radio, she won't let her kids listen to it either.  This is shown when the kids are hiding and listening to the fight on the stairs.  It shows that the people are behind him and want him to win too. At the church Mae goes to pray at all of the church members are there listening to the fight on the radio.  show how much support he had an showed how many people his life made an impact on.",

Its no surprise that I wasn't familiar with James Braddock story as it occurred many decades ago, specifically the 30's. However it still resonates today in this generation, a man that inadvertently became the people's champ and fought to save his family from being poor and being in the streets. Braddock inspired hope and strength for those suffering from the great depression. Ron Howard recognized these attributes and creates a fine story in the sports genre of cinema.\n\tJames J Braddock is a fierce fighter in the 1930's but outside of the ring Braddock faced his toughest opponent to date reality. Braddock and his family are one of the many victims of the great depression and after braddock breaks his han in a fight he is forced to do manual labor which can come and go at any moment. This makes life hard and complicated for the Braddock's. But when his longtime friend and manager Joe Gould comes to him with an fight opportunity Braddock takes advantage of it and begins to do things in the ring that shock the world. \nThis is one of the great comeback boxing films. To think braddock had enough of a comeback to make with a broken arm but to also deal with his own troubles during the worst economic downfall in US history is a killer. A very well adapted script coupled with great directing from Howard\nTremendous performance from Russell crowe. he is so good at portraying true toughness in a lot of his characters. Braddock was both tough in the ring and tough in the face of the great depression which makes routing for him very easy. paul giamatti was excellent as joe gould! this role seemed like a natural fit for him, so believable. Gould and braddock both fought the same fight when it came to the recession. Crowe and giamatti really captured that great friendship and comraderiee the two had.\nliked the lighting of the film. tremendous work to the editors of the film. one of the best editing moments I've ever seen in a film came when we see the knockout of john henry lewis and immediately the camera pans around and in one split motion the scene cuts to the figth with lasky, very impressive. Great cinematography especially with the boxing matches. Russell crowe looked great in each fight and you could see the intensity in the bouts. it was almost like you were in his shoes it was so up close and personal.  the final fight was as thrilling to watch as the ali foreman fight in Ali.\nCinderella Man is a wonderful boxing story that any fan of the sport will love or anyone that enjoys a great comeback story.",

            "content": "Cinderella Man stars Russell Crowe as Jim Braddock, a boxer on-the-rise until a broken hand and the Great Depression turn his world upside-down. Forced to work the docks to provide for his family, Braddock gets a second chance when his former trainer/promoter (played by Paul Giamatti in an Academy Award nominated performance) offers him a spot as a replacement fighter. This movie is based off of a true story, and, for the most part, the facts hold up. Whenever I watch a movie based on reality, I like to look into the real story to see what was exaggerated for the sake of film. Apparently, the biggest exaggeration in this movie was the portrayal of the \"villain\" boxer Max Baer, who in real-life was considered a gentleman instead of the crazy cliche we got on screen. My absolute favorite part of this movie was the film score. Thomas Newman, the mastermind behind the music for the Shawshank Redemption, understands emotions and creates music that matches the tone of this film perfectly. The performances from Crowe and Giamatti were also great. However, this felt like a big soap-opera. When things went south, not a scene went by when we didn't get a lingering shot of one or more characters having a case of the sads with somber music in the background. It was really overkill in my opinion. Ron Howard has directed his fair-share of emotional movies, but he really went overboard on the emotional turmoil, which is hard considering what a tough time it really was. I understand that this is a great story of a true Cinderella Man representing overcoming tough obstacles during a low point in American history, but with movies like Rocky, Million Dollar Baby, and even Ali, Cinderella Man falls short as a sports film great. The 2-hour-plus runtime drags along, forcing you to endure the melodrama longer than you'd like. Is it a bad movie? No. Forgettable? Absolutely.",

Akiva Goldsman and Cliff Hollingsworth did a fantastic job with the script and kept it investing for 144 minutes. The characters are very memorable, especially James Braddock who you can tell that he is trying to do his hardest to keep the family living. WIth the story taking place during the Great Depression, it really makes the drama very strong and effective which makes you want to root for him and their family's survival. The fight scenes are exciting to watch and I was worried about whether or not he's going to survive. The story is really good, and actually reminded me of Rocky while still being its own thing. It's one of the best boxing movies I have ever seen and the best way I said it about this movie to my teacher which I don't know if it's spoiling it, but I said that Cinderella Man is the Rocky V that Rocky V failed to be.",

A film critic from \"TIME OUT\" magazine said it best when he wrote  \"The affection for Braddock and his story can be felt in every frame and heard in every word.\"  Ron Howard's fiercely compelling (2005) boxing epic \"CINDERELLA MAN\" is a genuine cinematic masterpiece that's hands down the absolute greatest boxing film of all time!\nThis critically acclaimed motion picture is an all-time best for the impressive and illustrious careers of both director Ron Howard (Apollo 13) and lead actor Russell Crowe (Gladiator).  Crowe's magnetic and visceral portrayal of boxing underdog James Braddock is unforgettably phenomenal and to this very day still one of the most impeccable acting performances of all time.",

Here there is no great struggle to win against injustice. If you want a better movie about the Depression and a sports' figure inspiring the dispirited downtrodden, how about Sea Biscuit?

He's a perfect choice for this role.It is hard to think of actors who can equal his personal force on the\r\nscreen. He is brilliant. This is one of the best performance of Crowe's career. Also, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger as Mae Braddock acts superbly in this film. This film is an example of perfect casting . Every actor does a brilliant job.\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent inspiring story. Director Ron Howard developed the plot intelligently and also developes the each character in the film. This drama really involves the audience. Ron Howard has made of the real\r\nlife of Depression-era prize-fighter\r\nJames J. Braddock a work of art.\r\nThe camera work is phenomenal.\r\nWithout using violins or clich\u00e9'\r\npull-back shots showing the\r\nnumbers of people homeless and\r\nin soup lines, Howard makes the\r\nDepression a visceral reality with\r\nscenes of near-hopeless men at\r\nthe docks, pleading for a day's\r\nwork; a stolen salami; Crowe's\r\ngiving his daughter his breakfast\r\npiece of bologna, telling her he\r\ndreamed he was full. The bleakness of the times is the graininess and the sepia/greyness of the camera shots; the images are stark but completely descriptive. Crowe as Braddock with hat in hand and tears in his eyes, begging for twenty dollars so he can get his children back into his home, is the\r\npersonification of pride sacrificed\r\nto desperation. But when Braddock is later asked at a press\r\nconference why he is fighting at\r\nhis age and after so many poor\r\nshowings, all he has to say is\r\n\"milk\" to be supremely eloquent.\r\n\r\nOverall, \"Cinderella man\" is a\r\ngreat movie, with authentic heart.

The outcome of the film may be apparent right from the start, however, it is based off of a real life story so it's not like it has been Hollwoodized, but it doesn't take away any of the power and life that this film has and actually does have some surprises in store. An excellent Russell Crowe, who, with his haircut, reminds me of a young Cliff Robertson, once again shows his ability for versatility and mastery of accents. He just has this aurora about him that really brings these characters to life and really makes them likeable. Paul Giamatti was a lot of fun, seeing him be so lively on the side of the ring like a little jumping bean was a lot of fun to watch, he was quite funny too. I'm surprised this is what got him an Oscar nod, he certainly wasn't bad, clearly, but I thought it would have been 'Sideways' or something but maybe it's because of how different he was here is the reason why he got it. Ren\u00e9e Zellweger did a good job but she felt like wasn't in the film enough, as well as Paddy Constantine, who was a surprising but great choice for the role; they're not poorly developed or anything, they just didn't seem to be on screen much or have all that much to do and have little point. The main focus here is Braddock and Gould.\n\nThe look of this film is outstanding and very authentic, the cinematography is gorgeous and vividly brings the era to life; the script develops its characters well and doesn't rely on any clich\u00e9s to get its story across. That is besides one, whilst everyone else has some depth Max Baer doesn't really have anything to him at all, besides being the antagonist to our story. It works because he really annoyed me and I couldn't wait for the fight to happen but the tiniest bit of depth wouldn't have gone a miss, and from the sounds of it, the actual Baer did have quite a lot to him, saying that, he did respect his opponent, but when the fight started? Well, all bets were off, still, Craig Bierko did a very good job. Speaking of, the boxing matches are excellently filmed and very involving; they are just dazzling to watch, gritty, powerful and really grab onto you. The final fight, that could have easily lasted about 20 minutes, I'm not all that sure, I lost track of time because of how involved I was, featured some masterful directing. I found the overall film very involving because before the final fight I was actually starting to get a little nervous for Braddock, now that's great filmmaking. I also never felt like Braddock was 'washed up' he just had a bit of bad luck, it happens to everyone, but then again I guess that's why they say he's only 'supposedly' washed up, but even so.\n\nLike most successful boxing films, the story follows a familiar arc but this film succeeds because it is written really well, absolutely nails the setting and has good, likeable characters. It doesn't manipulate emotions out of the viewer, it actually earns them very well and it is ultimately a very feel good film but it's the best kind. However, it would have been interesting to see it break convention and show us what happened in his next fight, but, hey, who am I to kill the mood? It tells us what happens in Braddock's future right after he wins and I found that a little disheartening, it actually ends the same way 'A Beautiful Mind' did, only in terms of the text it shows on screen; the film also starts the same way as well, actually, with the music playing over the opening titles of the same companies that worked on both films. I also like the way the film handled flashback scenes and the way that it shows what characters are thinking, it's just really creative and smart. With excellent acting from a powerful cast, solid writing, excellent cinematography and all around well crafted by Ron Howard, 'Cinderella Man', is a fantastic example of classic filmmaking and it's another film off of the list.",

            "content": "A great movie that performs as a boxing epic and doubles as an insightful analysis of Depression-era America and the family structure of the time.\r\n\r\nGrit and desperation are key factors to many boxing careers, often the ones that are bright sparks as opposed to long flames. Braddock's story is one like that and this films knows it. \r\n\r\nThe role was perfect for Crowe and the supporting cast are on top form too. Giamatti and Zellweger were also very well cast and the film brought out their talents accordingly. Its well-written and there's some strong dialogue in there that's just occasional enough to be memorable- perfect for a boxing film.\r\n\r\nThere's not too much emphasis on the fight scenes here- they are well-done but they are also there to further the rest of the story, as it should be- something many boxing movies seem to forget. \r\n\r\nWith most films I'm understanding of the criticism that they receive- I may not agree, but I can see the points being made. I think its worth mentioning with this film though that the majority of criticism put to it is fairly unconvincing. \r\n\r\nFirstly, the criticism that this is a fairytale story- indeed it is, its no secret, there's lines in the film referring to how such moments are not as one might imagine them to be. Its certainly got idealistic elements- I don't see what is wrong with these things, in fact, a good boxing movie almost always has them- while it may take notes, this film is not trying to be another Raging Bull.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there's criticism that can generally be applied to most boxing movies- nothing specific to this film, its unsubtle and overly-sentimental for example- again, how is this not exactly what everyone expected? Its very-well done and it was convincing, for me anyway.\r\n\r\nAny great depression-era film nowadays seems to be slaughtered for its unrealstic depiction of the times, as if, every film is supposed to contain the power that The Grapes of Wrath did- this film does a fine job in showing the circumstances for Braddock's family- that's what this is about after all, there's a great feeling of time and place here and I don't care how superficial it may be in the grand scheme of things because the movie experience itself is genuine- something Ron Howard is great at creating.\r\n\r\nI do get some of the criticism though- there is indeed a lack of personality within Braddock's depiction here, its too 'stereotypical nice-guy' but this film stars Russell Crowe so what on Earth did you expect going in? That criticism holds up more with the film's depiction of Baer- indeed it is far too 'stereotypical bad-guy boxer' and it was pretty unnecessary. \r\n\r\nI think the length is about right but I see why it drags on for some, there's only so much you can do with the typical boxing-movie format and its not easy to successfully do all of what this film tries to do and sure, it doesn't always hit the spot and maybe those moments could have been cut. \r\n\r\nOverall, I guess it comes down to what a clich\u00e9 means to a film's audience- is it now always a bad thing or do you believe, like me, that clich\u00e9s can be perfectly good if they are well-executed and delivered as is the case here?\r\n\r\nThis is one of Howard's best movies in my view and one of the best boxing movies I've seen. Unlike others like Ali for example, this one doesn't just follow the formulaic biopic boxing-movie style, instead it incorporates that in with the more traditional movie approach. \r\n\r\nThis is indeed a risky strategy but its handled well here- this film is well-executed throughout and the final fight scene's towering punches leave you certain of that. It may not pack the same emotional punch but it felt genuine to me and if we judge this as a biopic, there is no doubt that its a great tribute in cinematic form.",

The recreation of the depression is almost perfect from costume, to set all the way to the soundtrack. The life of Jimmy Bradock was a true triumphant comeback in and out of the ring, hence Cinderella man, \"the hope of the Irish.\" Max Baer's character is portrayed too evil for a not so horribly reputed deceased man, but it is a good tactic to help the audience root for the hero. You feel the tension of not only his family but all the people from New Jersey and of Irish descent when Braddock goes to fight. It is as though Crowe is going to war, kissing his family, Zelwegger in all black going to church, right before his bout with Baer, making it a little mellow dramatic. Overall outstanding pull with little use of unnecessary dramatic pull, simple story of a sport legend fighting for his family.",

            "content": "The reason Cinderella Man is great is because it combines elements of Rocky and Raging Bull without chatting into the same ultra-dark and brutal territory but instead tackling its own form of dramatic territory that emphasises various characters instead of just The Cinderella Man himself, as it's key focus is on boxer James J. Braddock but it also explores the world of boxing and the media influence, as well as how James J. Braddock influenced the people around him, and frankly Ron Howard's deep and meaningful direction combined with Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman's insightful screenplay ensures that the story is an in depth look at the world of boxing and how The Cinderella Man influenced it. \nAnd one thing that's important about a biopic covering a famous sports figure is that it has to be a film which has the heart of a true sports film, and due to the technical achievement of fine cinematography, strong editing and a good musical score, viewers are really easily able to get a feel for how the atmosphere within the boxing ring projects emotions into its characters. Cinderella Man finds a fine balance between exploring boxing and exploring its titular figure, which makes it an equally impressive boxing drama and biopic, and in my opinion it's more balanced than the boxing classic Raging Bull.\nAnd powered by Ron Howard's strong direction, the cast have plenty to work with.\nRussell Crowe makes a strong lead, and another good effort in his second collaboration with Ron Howard biographical film. They work really well together in characterising important historical figures as we learned before from A Beautiful Mind, and their effort on Cinderella Man enforces that, because it's another impressive and insightful biopic, even if the filmmakers have taken liberties with certain facts, again. Russell Crowe creates a strong Irish accent without going over the top and he gives a strong performance again.\nBut all the cast members are overshadowed by Paul Giamatti, which is a phrase I never thought I'd say. Paul Giamatti is unarguably at his absolute finest in Cinderella Man. His articulation of a Jersey accent is one of his finest talents he uses, but his strongest is really convincing me that he wasn't Paul Giamatti. I mean, he's so swift and perfect with his line delivery and so sophisticated and quick witted and street smart. It just seems like an alternative persona to Paul Giamatti as opposed to the characters he commonly finds himself playing, such as idiotic comedic characters like in Big Fat Liar. He's suave and quick and just excellent in The Cinderella Man, and there are so many appropriate words to describe his fine performance, but it can be summarised by the fact that he earned an Academy Award nomination for his performance.\nRenee Zellwegger is also at some of her strongest dramatic work in Cinderella Man without playing a character that falls into a melodramatic routine because she has an emotional grip on the dramatics in the story and uses her tenacity as an actress to back up Russell Crowe every step of the way as well as holding her own on screen. She fits the role really well and uses good voice articulation.\nAlthough Cinderella Man's portrayal of Max Baer is inaccurate, I feel like he is a clever combination of the media's depiction of him at the time and the person he actually is. There's one moment in Cinderella Man where he says to James J. Braddock that he doesn't want him in the ring because he doesn't want I to injure him, and I believed it. Even afterwords when he played it all off as a joke for the media, I still believed it. I believed that Max Baer was a good man and a hell of a boxer even though he was aggressive, and Craig Bierko did an excellent job in the role in terms of acting and mimicking Max Baer's fighting style. And he even blends acting and boxing together well because he plays to the public image well as well as making the effort to bring out the best fighter in James J. Braddock, and even after the fight he has the decency to touch gloves. If you know what Max Baer is really about and look at him at the right angle, you can really appreciate Craig Bierko's efforts, because he does a strong job.\n\nSo Cinderella Man is a powerful story which is constructed well and acted excellently, even if it is a predictable one.",

Renee Zellweger really shows just how fine of an actor she really is playing Crowe's characters wife, a very memorable performance. Like all great films all the multitude of parts really have come together to deliver a very fine film. \r\n\r\nOne of the very best boxing films out there. A story of survival and the triumph of the human spirit. A rousing story that will have you on a high after viewing this one.",

I learned that the great depression had not only impacted the economy but it also had many strong social impacts. Which caused people to become homeless, jobless, and without food or shelter. Cinderella man is an inspiring movie! It's also a life changing movie! It make us realize that no matter how many times you fall you can always get up and keep trying. Cinderella man also tells us that we should never give up on faith. Just when things were really bad for Jimmy, and his wife and everybody had lost all faith in him, he showed them wrong. Jimmy showed everybody wrong by beating the toughest boxer player named Max Baer. This movie has a great tailspin that surprises all of us! We never think that Jimmy would have such determination and get up fall after fall. Jimmy's amazing comeback inspires the life of many of us! This movie lets us know that even though many people were suffering through the great depression there was some people that never gave up hope. Which is something we can all learn from this movie.",

To me, when i see him fight through everything with his head held high he makes me want to push myself a little bit more. I loved how in the movie he was such a role model and real hero for everyone in his community. he proved that when your down on you luck you can always rise to the top. honestly, the most inspiring moment was when he was on the ropes and he saw how the other guy died and he chose to not end up like him and kept fighting. He truly has the biggest heart. even with a broken hand and some broken ribs he was able to keep fighting. that's why his name will forever be remembered. the part in the movie when he had to collect the government money was so sad but at that time he had to do what he had to do. i wish i can be half the that guy was. at the end he taught me a lesson, a lesson on how if life beats you down keep your head up and keep fighting.",

A series of fights later leads to the championship match against the arrogant champ, Max Baer. Max had already killed two men in the ring and considers Braddock to be an old joke. Being the underdog James chose to do take on the heavyweight champ of the world, saying he feels he has nothing more to lose.\nA-       Cinderella man was a very interesting movie that had grabbed my full attention from the beginning. The great depression was rough for them, which kind of put me through a little bit of heir pain, more so since the one job he had to keep them steady was faltered with a horrible injury. Seeing Braddock struggle with his family and finances shows the true depression in the 1930s. Being badly injured James was unlucky enough to be cut from his only money source. With the odds not in his favor he caught a lucky shot from his trainer that gave him one more chance, and he beat it. Seeing his trainer give almost everything up on a whim that James had a chance to beat the champ and win as an underdog. Through a series of fights to redeem himself he found a better will, which was fighting for his family. Seeing this movie was seriously inspirational and I would most likely see it again.",

The plot of Cinderella man held promise for a good movie. The plot was faced paced, the action was intense, the characters were believable. There was just one thing that kept bothering me about the movie though. Where was the pain and suffering? Where was the poverty stricken families living in hoovervilles? Where were the hardships? All I saw was the rich wasting money that the poor didn't have. The movie circulated around the rich. The great depression didn't only revolve around the wealthy, the poor was hit the worst and you didn't really see this in the movie. Yes the movie was entertaining, but where were the facts, and scenes about how the poor survived during these harsh times? I just felt that the movie was missing some very important parts of the great depression.",
