            "content": "Amazing ! Not only Javier's acting, but the story of one man's life, and his battle to live it as he choose. The story is told so well, that it is like he is a good friend of yours, and you will want him to succeed, against your hope he doesn't. Very good cast and the settings are equally as beautiful as the story. A story that goes against the norm, and give insight into a man's free will.",

            "content": "The Sea Inside tackles the nonfiction fight of Ram\u00f3n Sampedro to obtain the legal right to end his own life, which took place over 30 years following a diving accident that left him paralyzed from the neck down. We mostly see Javier Bardem take on the character in his final years, after Sampedro had decades in his bed to think on his place and come to terms with his environment, so when we see him speak with well-wishers looking to convince him of the beauty of life he mostly responds with well-practiced jadedness. Though the film touches on plenty of melodrama, Sampedro is far from a simple character and Bardem gives him a vibrancy that isn't tempered by the character's wish to die. \n\nThese sort of personal struggle narratives are ripe for almost exploitative adaptations, with producers seeing award circuit potential in the philosophical debate and the demanding performances (it would only be a few years later that Mathieu Amalric rode his tortured performance in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly to massive acclaim). But the script gives some humanity to a cool discussion regarding mortality, particularly in the ability to depict Sampedro's perspective and emotional depth; a few well-placed visions of soaring through the air before reality sets in makes the main character's emotional state a bit more understandable. Some frustration at his surroundings, rather than just a 'noble quiet', give the situation some heft. (3.5/5)",

Alejandro Amenabar's The Sea Inside provides probing insight into the debate concerning assisted suicide, buoyed by a sensitive script, an extremely persuasive argument in favor of euthanasia, a cast of characters who manage to be easy to relate to regardless of their views on Sampedro's situation, and another solid performance from the always reliable Bardem.  Despite the controversial subject matter, The Sea Inside somehow manages to be both heartbreaking and wildly inspirational, sure to touch the most hardened of hearts.",

The nuances of life and human values and emotions are superbly weaved through the film. It's an incredible work of art.  The schisms between the beauty of love and the paralysis of illness/paraplegia are wonderfully portrayed.  An amazing life-changing film.",

            "content": "Emotional and poignant but at times can be overly dramatic. The Sea Inside is a sad film at its heart but it's also a very heartwarming film that explores the value of life through the thoughts of the main characters and his daily interactions with his family and friends. The cinematography is also a highlight of the film; beautifully showing the Spanish countryside. The downside of the film is the score as it becomes so overly dramatic at times that it becomes very distracting. In addition, Due\u00f1as's character was quite annoying at times and, excluding the ending, I was not fully invested when these two characters interacted with eachother. I watched this film because I was surprised it beat Downfall to win the Best Foreign Language Oscar. I believe it does not come near that masterpiece but it is slightly better than the other film that year; The Chorus. Overall, an intriguing, well-acted and beautifully shot film, sometimes let down by its score.",

            "content": "If you're looking for a complex, deep, philosophically-inclined film about death, or one about the complex legal issues behind assisted suicide, you're going to be disappointed. It doesn't give much insight or attention to either of those things; instead, \u2018The Sea Inside' opts to focus on Ram\u00f3n Sampedro's personal life: his emotions, his family, his life at home. As such it relies entirely on the characters and actors, and they absolutely live up to expectations. The characters are wonderfully written with a lot of feeling and there is something relatable about each and every one of them, even if there's not many of them that get a lot of screen time; from an acting perspective, Javier Bardem's central performance is sublime and captures Sampedro's struggle with grace whilst the rest of the cast do outstanding work in support with what they're given to work with. You'd be forgiven for assuming a film about a man wanting to kill himself because of what he considers to be a situation akin to a living hell sounds like it could be depressing and macabre, but whilst its undoubtedly melancholy and somewhat melodramatic, co-writer/director Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar does a great job of balancing out the tone and gives the story a positive vibe. Ultimately, this is not a complicated film, but a simple one that deals primarily in emotions and humanity; it feels like a celebration above all else, a celebration of a seaman named Ram\u00f3n Sampedro who, despite his situation, had a positive effect on everyone he knew.",

            "content": "A remarkable movie, this true story is anchored by the best performance I've seen by Javier Bardem. He's generally a truly fine actor, but he clearly fully embraced this role and all the challenges that came with it. Also great are Rueda, Due\u00f1as, Rivera and Segura as the 'women in his life'. The loving, maternal side of women is a key aspect of the film, with each of these female characters showing great care and compassion in their words and actions. \nAmen\u00e1bar shows again why he was among the finest Spanish directors in the game for several years. He sets the tone early and maintains it exceptionally well. Some nice camera work, esp. late in the film. But this film is really about the story; about one man's fight to have true freedom and control of his life, his body, and his right to die with dignity. 3.8 stars",
