Suspicions are raised within the Jedi Council concerning Chancellor Palpatine, with whom Anakin has formed a bond. Asked to spy on the chancellor, and full of bitterness toward the Jedi Council, Anakin embraces the Dark Side.",

A unique Star Wars film that balances action, development, character interactions, concept and plot.  Ewan McGregor's performance as Obi-Wan was perfection, and so was Ian as Palpatine.  While a fun film to see, it may also be darkest entry in the Star Wars saga.",

See the fall of the Jedi is so emotional and many of moments carry this movie to the end. Ewan McGregor is amazing as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Natalie Portman portrays Padme really well. But Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader to this day does not get the praise he deserves. He played the role perfectly. A Star Wars that actually has heart in it...unlike a certain three movies made by Disney.",

After binging The Clone Wars in 2 weeks, it truly does make the experience of watching this movie so much better. The show gives context to almost everything in movie and it makes the writing look a lot better than it actually is. Despite the obvious flaws, I love this movie so much. This is most likely my most watched movie in my life. I've seen this countless times. I've fallen in love with the character Anakin Skywalker and consider him my favorite character of all time. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi is amazing and he plays the role so good. The characters are all great and the CGI/ special effects are a huge step up from the previous two movies. This movie is extremely flawed but it's always an incredible watch for me and is one of my favorite movies.",

That of course being the dialogue. However the awesomeness of the rest of the movie definitely made up for it. I have personally seen this movie over 30 times and I can tell you you learn something or discover something new every time. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get bored.

            "content": "This movie is beyond perfect. It's hard to explain. The opening starting out slow, tense, and with a simple but perfect drum is an excellent way to start out. Then we see two ships flying in perfect unison across the top of a republic ship. The camera pans over, and we're able to see the absolute chaos that is the battle they're about to fly into. It zooms in and we can quickly see that the pilots are Anakin and Obi Wan. It's immediately made clear that the clone wars has shaped them for the better, becoming almost the perfect duo. They fly over the grievous's ship with perfect communication and incredible action and amazing music, and then we get to clearly see exactly what kind of person Anakin is. When the clones are put into an evidently deadly situation, he immediately tries to go off to help them, only to be turned down by Obi wan. (Potentially foreshadowing and/or reflecting how his compassionate personality is treated by the Jedi order) The fight with count dooku is amazing and it was really fun to see such a well made lightsaber duel. Then the attempted escape with palpatine is hilarious, once you know that he's the Sith Lord. The introduction to grievous is cool, and the idea that he collects lightsabers as trophies is very original. Of course I have to mention the memes and other humor. The jokes always seem to land and the memes just make it a really entertaining experience. Then there's the major improvement that jar jar doesn't even have any lines. All of the cringe dialogue is reduced significantly, and clumped into one very brief and irrelevant scene with Anakin and padme where they don't discuss anything important. The next major scene is the utapau battle. It's so clever to use Obi wan fighting general grievous in a 1 on 1  to distract all of the droids from the entrance of the clones. It's also a nice way to keep Anakin and Obi wan split up until the end. (Spoilers, the end is amazing) The slow reveal from palpatine to anakin that he's the Sith Lord was written in the most genius and fabulous way possible. Starting with just a minor mention of the dark side, and then supporting it, and then admitting he knows it, until finally saying that he knows padme is going to die and Anakin is desperate for a way to stop it. The way anakin says \"I would certainly like to\" in response to palpatine asking if he's going to kill him is really well acted out as well. After Anakin gets several Jedi masters to arrest palpatine but mace windu once again mistreats him, we're shown a perfect, near silent scene with amazing lighting, score, and acting where Anakin considers whether to choose the life he's worked for for 14 years, or his wife, and the man that showed him genuine compassion for almost his entire life. With him finally deciding to stop mace windu from killing palpatine, we cut between anakin desperately trying to get there in time and two of the most powerful force users going all out against each other. With palpatine defeated and using last resort measures to keep himself alive for just a brief amount of time, he gives it one last try to convince anakin to join him.  In these few seconds, where mace is about to end palpatine's life, Anakin makes a gut decision to do whatever it takes to save the only link to a way to save his wife. People say he fell too quickly, but he was being brought down by the Jedi council over and over again, held back intentionally by Obi wan for a decade, and completely forbidden to experience any attachment in the Jedi order. In comparison, palpatine had really supported him and lifted his ego for years, and he had a chance to save padme by joining him. From his point of view, it was an obvious choice, and once he picked it, he was gone. Anakin was no more and would do horrible things. Later w during the raid of the Jedi temple, the score matched perfectly as he secretaries hundreds of Jedi, and it was truly tragic and legitimate proof that he had fallen completely when he killed the helpless young kings without remorse. \n\nOrder 66.\nYou can't beat it. Seeing palpatine give the extremely cold order in such a gravelly voice, and the robotic \"it will be done my lord\" from the clones is just perfect. It's like they're forced to, and later in the clone wars series we found out they were. Knowing all of the tragedies now that took place from all of the games, shows, and comics in more recent times makes the scene even more saddening and I actually shed a tear thinking about it during my last watch of this movie. The speech palpatine gives and the \"thunderous applause\" regarding the formation of the empire is bone chilling and compelling. Then the final lightsaber fights intercut between each other is some of the best Star Wars ever. I know i've talked about the score a lot, but it's just perfect for this scene. Absolutely perfect. Amazing work by John Williams. You can really tell that they practiced for that fight, and the cgi is actually really well done. I honestly can't tell the difference between the cgi there and the cgi today. The end of the movie with the birth of Vader and death of padme paralleled is perfectly made and the famous \"noooooooooo\" really shook me on the first few watches. This movie is an unexplainable kind of perfect. It has flaws, but somehow it's flawless. It has problems, but somehow those problems aren't there. The way George Lucas learned from his mistakes in the previous prequels is amazing, and it's a real shame that some fans SOMEHOW didn't like this movie and pressured him to sell. (And we all know how that turned out)",

The reason the Jedi were so dull is because they had to live without feelings or emotions the whole complaint of the prequels lacking emotion is why it's genius. It's genius because Anakin's forced suppression of his feelings is what makes him into Darth Vader. And the big twist of the saga was that the Jedi were what turned him to the dark side of the force. Lucas knew that everything was going to be obvious for this film except that the Jedi were the corrupt ones. This film is packed full of amazing fights and contains the most emotional and best duals in the saga. All of the imperfections people point out about this movie is what made it perfect. The story of Sidious manipulating the entire Jedi order and the republic to build his own empire by using it against itself is brilliant. General Grevious and Dooku foreshadowing Anakin's fall was brilliant. This expanded the Star Wars universe beyond what it was in the original trilogy and is what has made the story of the first 6 episodes of Star Wars a beautiful and undying story.",

Christensen, McGregor, Portman, McDiarmid, Jackson, Oz, Wood, Lee, Jones, and Smiths had good performances. The only major weak point of Episode lll IMO is the memed dialogue but the dialogue doesn't bring down the tone or the story.

Having said that though, I still was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it looks absolutely amazing. If there is one thing all the Star Wars movies have in common, it is that they are all a marvel to look at. With the marvellous cinematography, splendid special effects and colourful sets, it was a feast for the eyes. John Williams has a record for writing truly magnificent scores for ET, Home Alone and Superman, and is up there with Hans Zimmer, Danny Elfman and Jerry Goldsmith as one of the best film composers ever. The score he did for this film is no exception; it was absolutely outstanding. The performances in general were a lot more solid than they were in the other prequels. Ewen MacGregor impresses as Obi Wan, Frank Oz is brilliant as Yoda, Christopher Lee was superb as Count Dooku and Ian McDiarmund steals his scenes as the benevolent Palpatine. Natalie Portman shows beauty and a vast emotional range as Padma. However there were problems I had with the movie. While not as bad as he was in Attack of the Clones, Hayden Christensen did for me give a wooden and unconvincing lead performance. Plus whereas the stories in New Hope, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back are clear, sophisticated and fast paced, there were pacing problems here and the plot was murky and convoluted. And sadly, I also thought the dialogue was as wooden as Christensen's performance. Overall, a good movie, if you want the real thing, watch New Hope, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back instead, but on its own merits it's watchable. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

There also is issues with some action scenes such as the end fight dragging and feeling way too long and over the top and with no interactions in between to break things up it makes it drag far too long. Also there is some sloppy writing at times as well. However the ambition does shine through all the flaws this has significantly and isn't as bogged down in a myraid of issues as the two other prequels are. This is the story it feels like George Lucas wanted to tell and because of that it is a Classic in the franchise though a big step below any of the original trilogy or The Force Awakens.

He had the turn to Vader planned out well, and he had trouble writing his way backwards to make a trilogy out of the story to lead to that point. There are great space battles, there are great lightsaber fights, there are great emotional moments near the end.

Incredible action scenes, great world building, acting/cast and despite the script flaws, Hayden Christensen's performance was phenomenal in becoming Darth Vadar.  Furthermore, Lucas and cast captured the demise of the Jedi masterfully.  Both Christensen and McGregor made for a terrific duo who showcased raw emotion and conflict with the Jedi Order - the latter being instrumental in Anikan's fall to the dark side.  This one is even better when you rewatch after the final trilogy and will only get better with time.",

Taking place 3 years after Attack of the Clones at the end of the Clone War, Revenge of the Sith shows the final moments of the Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire, alongside the fall of Anakin Skywalker to the dark side. It is a tragic story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, whether it's a battle in space, or a duel aboard a star cruiser under siege, or the gut wrenching Order 66 sequence, or the film's epic climax. If I were to change anything, I would make it a bit less campy, spruce up some of the dialogue and change the lightsaber duel of Yoda vs Palpatine to a fight using only the force.

            "content": "A fittingly mediocre end to George Lucas' embarrassing prequel trilogy.\n\nDirector George Lucas' sci-fi action-adventure Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) is certainly the best of Lucas' three prequels. However, it's still pure garbage of ugly, dated CGI and terrible writing. Lucas finally shows us how Anakin Skywalker turns to The Dark Side into the Sith Lord Darth Vader. It's truly underwhelming. For every lightsaber duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi against General Grievous or Anakin, there is dull space politics and bland talking. Yoda's fight against Darth Sidious is very entertaining, yet I just don't care about these characters anymore. I loathe Revenge of the Sith regardless of its few exciting lightsaber duels.\n\nGeorge Lucas' writing is simply absurd and dumb. We never saw Obi-Wan really train Anakin or befriend him, so their falling out feels hollow despite the epic lightsaber duel with force jumps and spinning blades. Padme's relationship with Anakin is at its most ridiculous as she waves away Anakin's fascist tendencies until it's too late. The Jedi Council full of Jedi Masters are somehow surprised the all-powerful Chancellor Palpatine is really the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Please, just let me forget George Lucas' horrendous prequel trilogy. I'll stick with Star Wars' Original Trilogy and Rogue One. That's all for Star Wars for me.\n\nIf only producer Rick McCallum could have reigned in George Lucas' worst ideas. Editors Ben Burtt and Roger Barton cut too quickly around the duels and action, so you cannot really see anything half the time. The pacing for the drama is ultra slow and forces you to sit there through Anakin's whining and arrogant rage. Hayden Christensen's indignant outbursts and arrogant hate fit Anakin, but it's never fun to watch. He raves about fascist ideas to Padme and complains to Obi-Wan that he doesn't immediately get what he wants. It's so ludicrous.\n\nEwan McGregor is moving and endearing as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but he's never given a chance to show Obi-Wan befriend Anakin and care about him other than scolding him. His duels with Grievous and Anakin are cool at least. Natalie Portman is devastatingly sad as Padme, but gets to do nothing at all this time, but stare in shock at Anakin's horrifying ideas. Ian McDiarmid is by far the best actor here and delivers a tremendous performance as Palpatine manipulating Anakin as well as The Emperor dueling Yoda with a gleeful cackle. Samuel L. Jackson feels shockingly underpowered and dumb as Mace Windu. He gets unceremoniously killed off too quickly against The Emperor.\n\nJimmy Smits gets no scene time to let us get to know Bail Organa, so I don't care about him. Frank Oz is great as Yoda, but he's still ugly CGI instead of a charming puppet. Anthony Daniels is hardly here as C-3PO. Christopher Lee gets one cool duel and speech as Count Dooku before getting wasted. I don't care about any of the other characters. Even R2 does nothing this time.\n\nCinematographer David Tattersall's shots should be pretty, but simply reveal the ugly CGI backdrops that look so fake and cheap, despite the movie costing millions. If only George Lucas had him shoot the duels with less cuts in a more stylish manner, Revenge of the Sith might look better. Gavin Bocquet's designs for The Galactic Senate and The Jedi Temple are cool, but rendered as tacky CGI, so it looks gaudy instead of glorious. Visual effects artists Roger Guyett, John Knoll, Rob Coleman, and John Walker tried their best, I'm sure. But I cannot stand the CGI Yoda, backgrounds, and scores of troops in clusters of unintelligible action. General Grievous still looks weirdly good somehow. Darth Sidious' Force Lightning looks awful now.\n\nComposer John Williams' score is fantastic, but just because his music is glorious and emotional, does not mean that what is in frame is any more interesting. Sound designers Ben Burtt, Teresa Eckton, Tom Myers, Matthew Wood, Christopher Scarabosio, and Paul 'Salty' Brincat clash lightsabers and blow up The Senate with a magnificent grandeur to their sound effects choices. Trisha Biggar, Gillian Libbert, and Nicole Young give every Jedi and Sith excellent robes this time around with more flair than the cheap fan looking robes from the last two movies. Nikki Gooley, Shane Thomas, and Vivienne MacGillicuddy come up with a great old age make-up for Palpatine as Windu injures him.\n\nOverall, I hated Revenge of the Sith despite a few cool moments.",

I recently rewatched this movie because I hadnt seen it since I was a kid and wanted to rewatch it within the eyes of a developed movie-loving brain. The result was disapointing. The script writing is god awefull, especially in the parts where it should be good but still  doesnt deliver. The pacing is the  predecessor of Godzilla vs. Kong, where everything that isnt any  fight scene is unbarably slow, there is so much pointless crap to fill in the time. For example: the wookie fight on Kashyk. There is no need whatsoever to add it to the movie, it does absolutly nothing besides a ridiculous Chewbaca camio. The lightsaber action sequences are also very overated. Even in even worse movies like the Phantom Menace the duel of the fates fight stayed pretty realistic and comprehensable. This movie just has Obiwan and Anakin doing repetative lightsaber twirls and spins that look like 2 5 years olds playing sword fight with sticks in the backyard. bad CGI is littered over all the fight sequences and even the normal parts of the movie. Lastly, the Anakin-turns-to-the-dark-side plot is just about the most absurdly overated and oversimpathized thing I have ever seen. Anakin, in about 10 minutes, goes from hardheaded but still dedicated and charming jedi to literally slaughtering children and swearing elegance to the sith. All because he is kinda ish friends with a creepy old man and didnt get the job promotion he wanted. Yet I still get comments from my friends praising it as a \"slow, dramatic turn to the dark side\". Very stupid. Overall, very sloppy movie and the only reason people like it is because they have the maturity of a 5 year old who just wants to see lightsabers and flashy action sequences without understanding anything else.",

Lightsaber fights are more captivating, visuals still hold up rather well, and even the performances are more convincing - dialogue remains pretty bad, especially within the love relationship between Anakin and Padmé, but Christensen surpasses his previous performance. The score continues to be as memorable as ever.\n\nIt may be far from my personal favorites, but it's, without a doubt, a film that deserves the positive evolution it has received as well as its fans.

I never really gave them a chance since I always heard overly negative reviews about them (Mr. Plinkett, I'm looking at you). As a result, I became an OT purist. I didn't actually watch the Prequels until I was 17. I ironically liked the first two episodes, clunky dialogue and stiff plotlines included all the same (I actually liked Episode 1 better than Episode 2, despite many Prequel critics citing the opposite). When I came upon Revenge of the Sith, however, I was surprised to realize that I genuinely loved it. Sure, it still contains bits of \"Lucas dialogue\", but otherwise, it was a visual masterpiece. Perhaps it's because it speaks to the tragic part of my character, but I found the story extremely compelling. Anakin is the hero, a great Jedi Knight, The Chosen One, and yet he falls from the light for the sake of fear - fear of losing his wife as he has lost his mother. From a psychological perspective, Anakin's character presents the epitome of a broken mind. He was enslaved at a young age. When he was set free, his liberator was killed just days later. He was indoctrinated by the Jedi, forced to live a lifestyle that opposed every fiber of his very emotional and passionate personality. He was built up to be the savior of the Galaxy and developed a god complex as a result. He promised his mother that he would free her only for her to die in his arms. He was forced to marry the only woman he has ever truly loved in secret, and so, when faced with the prospect that she will die, he turns to Palpatine after being snubbed by the Jedi. He is a tortured mind that cannot escape enslavement, either to others or to an ideology, or to his fear, and so he turns to the only person that has ever validated his feelings. \n\nWhen I watch the OT, I do it because I want to feel joy and hope. When I watch the Prequels, specifically Revenge of the Sith, it is because I simply want to feel.",

The opening to this film is great fast-paced Star Wars action in space and we get some great antics with Anakin and Obi-Wan that shows off their friendship better than the previous movies. Order 66 is heartbreaking, especially with the added context given to it by the Clone Wars animated series. The final face-off between Anakin and Obi-Wan is also the greatest duel in all of Star Wars. This movie truly is George Lucas's magnum opus and is an absolute must-see!",

This movie had the perfect close to 2 decent predecessors. This movies acting improved so much over the last movie and Anakin and Padme relationship and struggles actually felt real! It was also a amazing bridge to the OGs! Every moment of this movie is a 10/10! The Count Dooku vs Obi and Ani fight was jaw dropping and a great example of what to come in the next 2 hours. The Obi v Grievous fight started amazing, middle was meh, and the kill at the end was great at exposing the weaknesses of a half robot general. The order 66 scene was only a short demonstration of the slaughter that it was, and perfectly showed what happened. Paply v Yoda and Palpy v Mace fight showed the immense power of the Dark Lord of The Sith. \n\nFinally, Obi-Wan Kenobi vs Anakin Skywalker. This fight is the best moment in cinematic history, this scene not only had flawless choreography but it meant so much. The dialogue before the spar perefectly described Anakins inner struggles and how the Dark Side can drive you to try and kill your best friend. Obi-Wan drove his own struggle, seeing is best friend, brother at that point turn his lightsaber against him, he knew there was no hope. The fight across the lava was visually stunning and a eye pleasure for sure. The final scenes with Obi finishing him off but crying at the fact someone so close can do something so terrible. Anakin, clouded by dark, can't even express human emotion to the point where he states \"I HATE YOU!\" Is just heartbreaking. Then the final scenes of the last 2 Jedi's go into their hidings (Ashoka and Cal are forgotten rn) is sad to say the least. \n\nI've stated my case, this movie deserves something that no other movie gets. (my opinion) BEST MOVIE EVER! \nStar Wars: Revenge of the Sith;   11/10",

First, the CGI, visual effects and cinematography are ahead of their time; some films made in the last five years don't look this good! Second, anyone who said Hayden Christensen was a bad actor won't have anything to say here because he really brings it in this movie, especially during Anakin's betrayal on Mustafar and when he says \"I HATE YOU\" to Obi-wan. In fact, all the lead acting is incredible from Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Ian McDiarmid and Samuel L. Jackson. Aside from Duel of The Fates, the lightsaber duels in this are my favorite of the entire franchise, they're so well choreographed. Anakin's turn to the dark side is done really well, this movie builds on what we saw in Attack of The Clones when Anakin slaughters the sand people. I could feel the conflict in him and could see over the course of the movie as he fell further and further to the temptation of the dark side. Anakin's journey from being a slave boy to the most iconic villains in film was great to watch and I thought this movie concluded the prequel trilogy so well. The emotional weight and devastation you feel during the Order 66 sequence and Anakin's betrayal are conveyed beautifully through the cinematography, music and acting. On to my final point: the music is unbelievable, John Williams really brought his A game and it really helped to elevate the tension, excitement, and other emotions during many scenes.

Con giros de guion que aunque ya predecimos, los mismos no dejan de ser impactantes.

First, the Good: This movie is the darkest movie in the saga. The genocide of the Jedi is the point where this movie hits a MASSIVE tonal shift to pure despair, and boy does it work amazingly. The action scenes in this movie are perfect. The stakes are extremely high, the duels are choreographed to pure perfection, with every duel looking like an elaborate dance between superhuman fighters. The music in this film is the best in the saga. Anakin's Fall to the Dark Side is a tragic tale, which ultimately leads to the creation of one of the greatest villains of all time. There is so much I can gush over when it comes to ROTS, but I can't fanboy over this movie forever. Now for the bad. The dialogue hasn't improved much since Episode 2, another thing I can heavily criticize is Padme's death. George Lucas really couldn't come up with anything better than \"A Broken Heart\". All-in-All, I believe that you should go and re-watch this misunderstood cult classic.",

I have to nick the film for a few reasons. It tries so hard in the first half to try and be a drama with Anakin unsure of what he should do. The movie then segways into him completely changing course mentally almost immediately with one scene in particular seeming unbelievable by any stretch - he was conflicted before this scene but he does a complete 180 in seconds and it just seems haphazardly written here. The movie also does a disservice to our prequel heroine, Padme. She is reduced to a stand by your man 'til it kills you 50s style house wife; it's sad because she was a cool woman who could fend for herself in the first two films. She's turned into a prop here and it's only her acting that saves it from being a wash. Last ding is that it's hard to believe the Jedi didn't know the Sith Lord was right in front of them the whole time; they're supposed to be wise and have prophetic abilities. All that to say this: there are some great battle sequences including the best lightsaber battle in the series. The back and forth storytelling works well here to keep the viewer engaged. I can't say the film is easy to watch in the middle - Anakin's transition into Vader is not only convoluted but disturbing. It's especially hard to watch in juxtaposition to the rest of the series' tone. We can assume things about good and evil but to see Vader's fall from grace is very depressing. It is easily the least enjoyable 40ish minutes to watch in the whole saga. The first 40 and last 40 minutes however are enough to make it not only good but the best in the prequels. As a standalone story it is well done but not a movie you'll want to rewatch for fun - it's essential to the overarching story and that's it.",

This film accomplished what the prequel trilogy was aiming to do, which was to elaborate on the backstory of Darth Vader and Palpatine's rise to power through the corruption of the republic. We are shown how Palpatine's manipulation of Anakin comes to fruition after years of careful planning. We see the failure of the Anakin Obi Wan relationship and the establishment of Luke and Leia's upbringings. This film also has an amazing score, including some of John William's finest works such as Battle of the Heros and Duel of the Fates. This film also makes excellent parallels with the rise of Hitler and the fall of democracy in post WW1 Germany.  I do have some issues with this film, namely some of the acting is a little over the top. I also think the handling of Padme's death was rather cheesy. I think it would have been more fitting if it was eluded that Palpatine killed her instead of heartbreak. Overall a great film that deserves less hate that it gets.",

The film's plot is cumbersome and boring, and Hayden Christensen‘a character comes off as as a whinny, moody teenager. The relationship between his character and Natalie Portman's Padmé Amidala is supposed to be central to the film's story, but sadly, there is no chemistry between him and Portman. Ian McDiarmid's transformation from corrupt Senator to self-appointed Emperor Palpatine is clumsy and ridiculously fast. The worst movement in the film has to be the scene where Anakin wakes up on the operating table to see all of his limbs have been replaced by artificial appendages, calling out \"Nooooo!\". What was Lucas thinking? The entire new trilogy failed to replicate the magic of the original trilogy because Lucas strayed so far from his winning formula. His new Star Wars universe is clean and futuristic, whereas the original Star Wars world was dirty and used. His new characters are self-centred and annoying, whereas his original characters were relatable and heroic. His original films were action-driven, whereas his new films are dialogue driven. His old films had lots of in-camera effects, whereas the new films are CGI-laden. Most of all, his original films were adventures, whereas his new films are, unfortunately, just boring dramas.",

Now of course this isn't some absolutely masterpiece movie that could be remembered for being classic, but at least it saved the entire prequel trilogy by simply not doing anything bad. I had been waiting to watch this movie ever since I began bingewatching Star Wars. I watched this two years back, so the rating is from that time. I haven't changed it after seeing the cult following.\n\nThe story is a huge improvement over the previous two movies, although it does stay in line with them. In the last two movies it seemed as though they completely forgot that Anakin is supposed to slowly turn bad, which is something this movie did pretty convincingly. Anakin became Palpatine's bodyguard, and then he heard the story of Darth Plagueis the Wise. This movie's story is so good that I often get confused when I remember the good parts of Episode II, as to whether they were from Episode II or this movie. When I wrote the review for Episode II, I thought Anakin killing his mother's killers was from this movie.\n\nThe character development is also another thing that is much better over here. Starting from Anakin of course. He doesn't like sand. It's rough and course and gets everywhere. The Kenobi-Skywalker duo who were the besties in the beginning of the movie became enemies in the end. Mace Windu gets his comeuppance for being so annoying. And of course, how can I forget that my favourite character, General Grievous is from this movie? He learnt the art of dual wielding from Count Dooku himself!\n\nThe next big thing was the CGI. It's amazing how come the first two movies had such a bad CGI but it improved so much over here. It's almost like they took some extra time to polish the visual effects. The cinematography is also a lot cleaner now. Unlike the last two movies, I didn't feel like falling asleep in the middle of the talking scenes.\n\nWith all that said, nothing is still perfect. The VFX being better than the last two movies is actually a very low bar. The acting is still very campy. In the beginning scene where Kenobi and Anakin are talking after coming back from fighting Grievous (the one from which the \"This whole operation, it was your idea!\" meme came), they are both speaking such that one person will finish talking, the camera will linger on them for some time, then the camera will transition to the other character and then they will speak. It looked like a school drama. The final fight was fun but the dialogues ruined it.\n\nStar Wars: Episode III is one of, if not the best Star Wars movie. It is kinda sad that George Lucas does not have the cap when these movies are made. It would have been pretty cool to watch these movies in today's time and technology. This is way ahead of the dumpster fire that the sequel trilogy was. Although I have given it a less rating, I will increase it if I rewatch it in the future.",

Alas, though George Lucas failed to reach the thrilling heights of his original sci-fi saga, at least he concluded his involvement with Star Wars with a somewhat-redeeming final effort. What elevates this final chapter above other entries in the prequel saga is how it ties together the old and the new; the final act of this film bridges two eras in a bittersweet, narratively plausible way. Watching Anakin's descent into the dark side would have been far more worthwhile had they cast a better actor than Hayden Christensen in the role. Ewan McGregor was good, and Ian McDiarmid puts on a spotlight performance, completing the transformation of suspicious Senator Palatine into the fearsome Darth Sidius. As to be expected, the special effects were jaw-dropping, just as the writing was mediocre at best (and cringe inducing at worst).

The reveal of Darth Vader is great. The betrayal against the Jedis is also well done. The second half of the movie feels super intense. But there is once again too much drama between Anakin and Padme. The score is not as powerful in the first two movies (except the final 45 minutes. where the score is brilliant)\nThere fewer moments where the cuts feel like they are made with Windows Movie Maker, but they are still there. The simultaneous battles between Anakin and Obi-Wan & Yoda and Darth Sidious are perfectly edited and super intense and exciting.

It didn't need a lot of improvement but still it did. The visual effects team really made do with what they had and actually improved the visual effects quite a bit. As to be the largest setup for the original Star Wars trilogy, this film had many powerful moments. Anakin and Obi Wan as a dynamic duo was really amazing and t Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen nailed their friendship. Ewan McGregor is a phenomenal actor and I can't think of a single role he had that was bad. This is his best performance and he nails his critical scenes with Hayden. There are 5 lightsaber duels in this movie. FIVE. All of them are very entertaining and very different from one another and all important in very different ways. Anakin and Obi Wan's exchanges in the 3rd act, are some of the best in star wars, and their lightsaber duel is still seen by many as the best ever, including me. Initial reviews of this movie said that the Anakin and Obi Wan duel was too drawn out- it's the last lightsaber duel George Lucas was going to give us and it was the most important there ever was. It was fast paced, epic, visually stunning, perfect uses of dialogue, amazing landscapes, and just simply very entertaining even watching for the thousandth time. Some people say this movie is overrated in 2021 because of how many memes there are of this movie. Ignore the memes you still have an amazing movie. This movie is one of if not the best of Star Wars.

Hayden christensen and natalie portmans performance here really improve they do a great, serious, emotionally gripping job with what they are given. Its really emotional with what hapens when padme dies it just tugs at your heartstrings, we want her to be alive, but when she cant, its extremely emotionally gripping. This time there is no jar jar and the cgi looks great. The dialouge is much better than the other 2 previous ones, while the dialouge in phantom menace was hit and miss and attack of the clones was good, this one really felt star wars. And general grievous is a good villian. He has a cool design, character and fight with obi wan. The reason why anakin became darth vader is great. You see he has lost his children and wife the people he cares about most and wants to prevent this from ever happening again. A really amazing movie, not as good as empire strikes back, but still really really great. Revenge of the sith 100% A+",

I do have a couple of (relatively minor) complaints, but first the positives. I'd say this is the best that this cast produced during this run of films. Hayden Christensen is excellent in his role, it's the most I've liked him in 'Star Wars' for sure. Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman give more than solid performances as well.\n\nThe special effects look nice throughout, while the score is pleasant. I also found the pacing to be practically ideal, which is a marked improvement on its predecessors. The humour and dialogue still isn't great, yet is also bettered. Crucially, the plot is very good.\n\nWith all that noted, I do have two things I didn't love. The first being the event that includes Samuel L. Jackson's character. I completely get the intention and reasoning of what occurs, but how it is shown did feel kinda forced and poorly written.\n\nAnother is the end, which overruns ever so slightly. I know it's setting up the original trilogy, but there are a few too many scenes; could've/should've ended on you know who's first breath.\n\nHowever, all in all, I got a positive amount of entertainment and would class this as a step above the preceding two films. I'm glad about that, as it makes the prequel productions way more meaningful and memorable than they were looking to be based on the 1999 & 2002 releases.",

In this one Anakin finally falls to the dark side and becomes iconic movie villain Darth Vader. The script weaves together a great story that is part space opera and part Shakespearean tragedy. Hayden Christensen acting improves over the mediocre and weak performance of the previous installment. But in here bad dialogue, flawed acting, and plot holes continue to be a problem. Ewan McGregor shines once again as Obi Wan but is Ian MacDiarmid's portrayal of Palpatine  that takes the gold as he gives it all in as a manipulative mischievous villain who is the actual menace behind the star wars universe. The visual effects are beautiful and the drama is potent and George savagely descends us into a very dark and violent story that ends the prequel trilogy with a bang despite its flawed beginnings.",

Also, hayden and ewan chemistry is unreal, they basically give us a clone wars episode at the beginning of the movie and it is the greatest start to a star wars movie. The lightsaber battles are just perfection especially anakin v obi best lightsaber fight in the saga.",

This is also a film that makes you feel such a range of emotions that will make you feel shocked that a movie is capable of doing so. The battle of hero's is easily my favorite and most well choreographed lightsaber duel in the franchise. In fact, that sequence is so well choreographed that at times it almost feels to perfect to be able to happen like that. On top of that, the Order 66 sequence was done perfectly and one of the most emotional parts of the film. The only problem that I have with this film, that I guess I should also say applies to Eps. I&II is the dialogue. Although This film does a much better job at it than the previous two it still has some rocky moments. (More on Hayden Christensen's part than anyone else's though). But that aside this film is the perfect concluding story-line to the Star Wars universe! (Until the abomination of the sequels). 9/10 Film!",

            "content": "It has been three years since the Clone Wars began. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker rescue Chancellor Palpatine from General Grievous, the commander of the droid armies, but Grievous escapes. Suspicions are raised within the Jedi Council concerning Chancellor Palpatine, with whom Anakin has formed a bond. Asked to spy on the chancellor, and full of bitterness toward the Jedi Council, Anakin embraces the Dark Side. \n\tStar Wars is one of if not the most popular sci-fi trilogy in the world. It describes the battle between light and dark, good and evil. The Jedi Knights fight for honor and justice while the Sith fight for power and malice. Through the span of the trilogy, the main protagonist Anakin Skywalker, played by Hayden Christiansen, goes through many heart-retching situations. \t\tIn Attack of The Clones (II), Anakin Skywalker learns his mother is kidnapped by a group called Tuskin Raiders on Tatooine. With rage beginning to consume him, Anakin Skywalker leaves his post from protecting Princess Amadala to track the kidnappers. By the time he reaches their camp, his mother is already on the brink of death. In her final moments, she says, \"I…I…love….\" She dies in his arms. Fully enraged, Anakin Skywalker slaughters everyone in the camp. In my favorite quote, \"I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead, every single one of them. And not just the men, but the women and the children, too. They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals. I HATE THEM.\" The Sith use grief and anger to fully commit to the dark side of the force. Some Jedi Masters like Mace Windu can tap into the dark side to gain the upper hand in battle, however, they have to be a very powerful force user to not allow the dark side to completely take over their being. Another situation Anakin was juggling with was his love for Senator Amadala.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Years Back, in The Phantom Menace(I), Qui Gon Jin and his apprentice young Obi-wan Kenobi land on the desert planet of Tatooine looking for repair parts for their ship. Along with them is a young Princess Amadala. While on the search for the parts they need, they run across a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker. Off the bat, Qui Gon Jin scenes a great power within young Skywalker. Anakin meets Amadala and he is already in love. He asks if she is an angle because of how beautiful she is. Later in the later films, their love grows more and more, but their secret relationship is always tested. In lore, Jedi are not allowed to have feelings or relationships with anyone. As Yoda said \"The fear of loss is the path to the dark side. Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those who around you transform into the force. Mourn them do not miss them do not. Train yourself to let go and everything you fear to lose.\" At the end of the film, Qui Gon dies at the hand of Darth Maul, and Obi-Wan becomes the master of Anakin Skywalker. \n\tIn Revenge of The Sith (III), the clone war is coming to an end. Chancellor Palpatine gains a foothold on Anakin Skywalker. He achieved this by using his feelings against him. The possible loss of his wife, the death of his mother. He used these feelings to hook onto him and draw out his anger. All Palpatine had to say was these words to gain Anakin's full attention. \"He could use the force to influence the midichlorians to create life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side; he can even keep the ones he cared about from dying.\" Once he heard this, Anakin was up for being taught this power. After this confrontation, Anakin is with Amadala and states this. \"I feel lost. Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me. Something is happening, I am not the Jedi I should be. I want more, and I know I shouldn't. I found a way to save you from my nightmares. I won't lose you; I promise you.\" In the last 20 minutes of the film, Anakin fully embraces the dark side and fights his master Obi-Wan on the dark planet of Mustafaar. Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader, apprentice to Darth Sidious, and Order 66 is given. Order 66 is an order that forces the clone army of the Republic to turn and execute their Jedi generals. Anakin Skywalker pledged himself to the dark side by thinking Sidious can teach him how to save Padma Amadala. But this is just a trick to get him on his side. \n\tAll in all, I love the Star Wars trilogy. The lightsaber duels, the clone vs droid fight scenes, pretty much I can say that the Star Wars movies are my favorite movies. Although they have their flaws. In the movies after 1999, they are more politically based. Meaning there is more talking scenes or thinking scenes than fight scenes. Now in the older movies, like A New Hope or Return of The Jedi, those movies do not have a political party involved. My favorite performance was by Hayden Christiansen. He poured so much emotion into his scenes. When he killed the Separatist leaders on Mustafaar, he turned towards the camera with his dark glowing yellow eyes and a tear was streaming down his cheek. He truly made the audience feel what emotions Anakin Skywalker was feeling. Rotten Tomatoes gave Revenge of The Sith an 80% like rate. The audience score was 66%. Richard Corliss stated, \"A grave and vigorous popular entertainment, a picture that regains and sustains the film Force [Lucas] dreamed up a long time ago, in a movie industry that seems far, far away.\nThe critics were all around the same ballpark with the rating this film. Many said 6 stars or higher. I would rate this movie a 7/10 only because I am an action junky and I do not quite like politics in movies all that much. The Star Wars trilogy is still being watched by thousands of fans even if the movies are almost 20-30 years old. Any age can enjoy the amazing sci-fi experience.",

Anakin and Obi-Wan's relationship is much better here than AOTC, they feel much more like brothers so it's heartbreaking when Anakin turns to the dark side. This movie also has the best score out of any Star Wars movie (which is saying a lot) with Battle of the Heroes being my favorite. Ian McDiramid as Palpatine once again steals the show brilliantly and his plan is so brilliant and so flawlessely executed that you can't help but admire it and it does a great job leading to the original trilogy and damn this movie tugs at the heartstrings, especially the ending and the CGI is mostly phenomenal. This movie has obvious flaws but I can look past them as this movie has everything I wanted in a Star Wars movie and hence, it's my favourite",

            "content": "Yes it is an improvement. Yes it has some pretty good parts in it. Yes it is the best movie out of all of the prequels. But just because it's an improvement DOES NOT MEAN IT'S A \"GOOD\" LET ALONE \"GREAT\" STAR WARS MOVIE. People seem to think that just because something is improved it means that it's a great and amazing movie. But that's not always the case. An example of an improvement that it actually GOOD is Bumblebee. Bumblebee is a cute and fun movie where the plot is simple and it doesn't feel like an overwhelming around the world adventure like the other Transformers movies do and that's what makes Bumblebee such a solid improvement. But in my eyes, Revenge of the Sith makes all the same mistakes that the other prequels made and still has the cringey writing and acting. The opening action sequence was great except for the Count Dooku part (because the movie expects you to care for Count Dooku's death as if it's Anakin's start to the dark side, as if he didn't murder an entire village on Tatooine in Episode II), but then the movie goes right back to being boring afterward. And then the movie suddenly splits up the main characters. We finally got to see them in action together and we have fun while watching it but then split up for really no reason. The General Grievous fight was alright (I didn't think it was anything cool because you can't see anything while they are fighting), but it just went on for too long after. And when you think about it, General Grievous wasn't really needed in this movie at all. All he did was separate Anakin and Obi-Wan and then was killed by Obi-Wan. Count Dooku could have been kept alive and added more to the story than just being a mustache twirling villain in Attack of the Clones and for a couple of minutes in Revenge of the Sith. But nope we just get more villains that aren't big threats because more merchandise equals more money. Another thing that wasn't really needed in the movie was the whole Chewbacca planet battle. If you think about it, that entire side-plot served literally no purpose other than to provide some fan-service. The other problem I have with this movie is Anakin's whole turning to the dark side scenes. Overall, it felt underwhelming and extremely predictable, not only because people already knew that he was going to turn to the dark side because his name is Anakin Skywalker, but because we've already seen him to evil crap in Episode II. And now that he has another reason to turn to the dark side we already know exactly what's going to happen. The movie doesn't try to shift your expectations or lead to one way and then suddenly change and take you by surprise. It's too predictable. My last problem with this movie is the final fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin. To sum it up as simply as possible... it's way too long. I thought that lightsaber fights are meant to be short and sweet and really exciting. But with this one it just drags on forever and worst of all, you don't feel anything while they are battling because throughout these movies, they haven't developed any personalities at all. I only saw bland and dry characters having a super long light saber duel to finally end the movie. However, despite all of these things that I didn't like in the movie, there was one thing that I thought they nailed. It was that one scene with Anakin and Padme doing nothing and yet still doing so much. Without any words, you could tell by their faces that Padme is concerned and worried for Anakin and the future of the Republic, and that Anakin is hesitating and deciding whether to turn to the dark side to save Padme. It's subtle, the music was on point, and I think that I finally felt something (other than boredom) for once while watching these movies. However, that one scene can't forgive this entire movie's mistakes, let alone all of the other prequel movies. In conclusion, this movie is an improvement, but not enough of an improvement to make it a \"good\" or \"great\" movie. Also it's overrated.",

The scenes with Padme are not quite as torturous as episode 2.  It is maybe a little overly long, but that is because it is essentially 2 films.  The first film, Anakin is trying to be good but he is a bit of a whiney bitch.  But then, almost exactly 1/2 way in to this, the switch flips and he goes full on Dark Side and just light sabers anything and everything.  It isn't even subtle.  The first half has all the trappings of the prequels - Trade Federation, droids, Jedi masters poncing about yammering about politics, lots of washed out colors and daylight.   The second half goes dark - aside from the tone - there are lots of night scenes, there are more things you might recognize from the Original films like the blockade runner, and Anakin is now just plain evil.  The last half is truly what Star Wars fans want to see - how things end up the way Episode 4 starts out.  Scene after scene lays out what we are expecting to happen.  We even get to see the helmet!  Of course, ultimately you know what will happen - in a way it is like watching a movie like 'Titanic'.\nAll that said - there are some major logic holes in this film, and the prequels more broadly.  Some spoilers ahead - why did Obi Wan not finish off Vadar?  Easy, stick light saber in head, you know, just to be sure.  So Obi Wan failed to finish off Vadar, he failed to finish off Darth Maul (as we find out in future films), he TRAINED Vadar, he let Vadar kill him, he lied to Luke - are we SURE he isn't working for the Dark Side?  Why are Jedi always falling off high ledges?  If they can move things with their mind, can they not levitate?  It goes on, but you get the idea...",

            "content": "George Lucas' \"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith\" had high standards after the first two movies in what is known as the prequel trilogy which had let down fans everywhere. They also had the difficult challenge to make it surprising when fans already know what's going to happen thanks to the original trilogy. They accomplished this by not focusing on the main storylines as much, and instead trying to show what was going on inside the main character Annakin Skywalker's head and the pain and fear he was going through that led to the choices he made throughout the movie.\n\tThroughout the trilogy, Annakin has been separated from his mother, lost his first mentor, and held his mother as she died. This would take a toll on anyone, and in this film his emotions constantly take over his decision making. As Yoda explains in \"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,\" \"Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.\" This film shows Annakin's transition through these phases until he ultimately is not strong enough mentally to resist the temptation of the dark side of the force and Lord Sidious.\n\tThis leads to one of the most intense battles in the entire Star Wars series as Annakin takes on his former master and friend, Obi-Wan Kenobi, solidifying his change of allegiance from the Jedi to the Sith. Prior to the fight, Obi-Wan addresses this change as he says, \"You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind, until now…until now you've become the very thing you swore to destroy.\" This method of presenting the story was fantastic as it didn't focus on the major plot points that had already been spoiled, and instead highlighted the struggles of mental health and the effect that it can have on a person.",

Don't get me wrong though, it still has serious problems.  While the CGI is way better than Episode I or II, there's a lot of times when it's still awkward and obvious.  Obi-Wan on a giant lizard will never look cool, as much as I really want that series of words to be awesome.  Padme in this entry is absolutely useless.  At least in Episode I she was headstrong, and in Episode II she had some action hero in her.  Here, she's just reduced to a pathetic woman sitting on the sidelines while the boys figure crap out around her.  There are also major issues with the story as a whole.  The action scenes are kind of forced in, and Anakin's ultimate turn to the dark side happens jarringly fast.  There's also some things that I know are expanded in the larger universe but here just happen way too fast, like Order 66.  But there are still enough improvements to make it warranted.  Anakin is a little better here.  His dialogue is awful, and he still whines too much, but when he doesn't have to talk and just has to give that Dark Side glare he can actually be a little intimidating.  The directing and pacing actually feels a lot better.  There's some sequences, like the end with the parallel hospital imagery, that are definitely on the nose in symbolism but they still work.  The action is great too.  Did we need an army of Wookies?  No, but I still liked it.  And the final battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan is still incredible.  What makes it so good too is the brutality of it.  The Darth Maul fight was sleek, two opposing sides who knew what they stood for.  Here, there's so much raw emotion and power between the two and you feel it.  I actually noticed this viewing you can see how Anakin is trying to kill, but Obi-Wan very much plays defensively most of the fight, and little touches like that make it all the more effective.  And yeah, even when scenes are a little forced or underinformed, they can still work.  The Order 66 sequence for example, even if it is abrupt, is still effective.  So overall, yeah, I actually like this one.  It's far from perfect, and its flaws stick out like a sore thumb, but I still enjoy it enough to have had a few viewings in the past and probably a few more in the future.",

The reason I didn't rate it 5/5 stars is because it does have some weird dialogue occasionally. (Spoiler) Padme's death is kind of dumb, the whole dying of sadness thing.

We can't forget the memes from this movie, every sentence of the film can somehow be funny and i love it.

            "content": "Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith is as everyone says the best of George Lucas's prequel trilogy. The separatist trade federation, led by alien cyborg General Grievous and the sith is still at war with the old Republic and we follow Jedi knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi in their battles alongside clones and fellow jedi against drones and the sith. In a captivating open battle scene, Anakin slays the sith lord count Dooku and rescues the captive Chancellor Palpatine, who is clandestinely the sith overlord Darth Sidious manipulating the jedi order. Back home on Coruscant Anakin discovers his beautiful wife, Senator Padme Amidala, is pregnant. He soon has premonitions of his wife dying in childbirth. Meanwhile, he is becoming distrustful of the jedi council and desires greater power all the while being manipulated by Palpatine. He confesses all of this to his wife who does little to ease his woes apart from trying to comfort him by hugging and kissing him. At the same time, Palpatine claims to Anakin than there was a sith lord in the past who could use his powers to keep people from dying.\nMeanwhile, Obi-Wan hunts down General Grievous and defeats a drone army led by the separatist trade federation before slaying Grievous in a mesmerizing lightsaber duel (Grievous had been trained in the Jedi arts by Count Dooku). Anakin soon discovers the true nature of Palpatine and alerts Jedi master Mace Windu who instructs Anakin to stay home as he confronts the sith lord among a few fellow jedi. Palpatine makes easy work the jedi other than Windu in a brief lightsaber duel before becoming cornered by Windu. Anakin arrives, against Windu's orders, to find Windu about to execute Palpatine. Anakin rescues Palpatine killing Windu and immediately fully turns to the darkside, pledging himself to the chancellor. Palpatine then gives orders to Anakin to slay Jedi padawans and gives orders to clone troops to slaughter Jedi Knights. He then enacts martial law and declares himself emperor. He sends Anakin (now Darth Vader) to execute the remaining separatist leaders and end the Civil War. While on the lava planet after executing the separatist leaders Anakin is confronted by his wife Padme who pleads with him to accompany him home and raise their child together and leave behind the sith. Vader scoffs and instead he offers her to rule the galaxy alongside him and take Emperor Palpatine's place. He claims he has become more powerful than the emperor. This upsets Padme and she cries \"Obi Wan was right, you've changed. I don't believe what I'm hearing.\" This angers Vader and he put her in a force cholk, Obi Wan then reveals himself from Padme's ship in a surprise and makes Anakin let her go. An epic lightsaber duel between former brothers Anakin and Obi Wan then ensues. Meanwhile, Master Yoda has confronted Emperor Palpatine at his palace and they engage in a cool force, lightsaber duel. Palpatine defeats Yoda, but Yoda escapes and Obi Wan defeats Vader and Vader is deformed by lava and gets his legs decapitated but is rescued after Obi Wan leaves by Palpatine who gives him his robotic get up and mask.\nOverall, the movie is darker and moodier in general than the previous prequels. It also has better acting, a more riveting story, and the best visuals. Anakin's descent to the dark side is captivating and haunting and the movie leaves you on the edge of your seat on more than one occasion.",

There definitely should have been a little bit more time between Anikan becoming Darth Vader and him killing children and they should have gotten a better reason for Padme to die but the rest of the story is really good.  However  like all of the prequels this movie falls victim to bad lines and cgi.  Though the battle between Anikan and Obi-wan at the end is one of the best lightsaber duels in the franchise due to their emotion and their excellent ability with a light saber.  Overall if Disney remade this exact story with better lines then it would crush any of the sequels in quality and story.",

I have a hard time believing Anakin and Padme's relationship, sometimes the dialogue can come out as quite corny and unnecessary.\nOverall I think this is not a dialogue-driven movie, you watch Star Wars for the story and the passion, the love for lightsabers and blasters, for the love, the Jedi, and the Sith.

The reasons on why he's better is due to him having better dialogue which works well and it's quite a small thing but his facial expressions when he's taking with other characters show him to be quite an angry and annoyed character, not really shown as the whiny brat he was in Episode 2. Also, the fight scenes here are very fun and engaging not like the ones in Attack Of Clones, we get to meet some new villains and witness some brilliant fight scenes with them. Honestly, my favourite fight scenes throughout this movie would have to be the one where it's General Grevious Vs Obi-Wan Kenobi and the final fight scene where it's Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) vs Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) those fight scenes are always amazing to watch. Finally, the Revenge Of The Sith has got an amazing plot with a brilliant ending which links up perfectly to A New Hope.

The acting is near perfect, with Hayden Christiensen giving his most convincing performance as Anakin, and Ewan McGregor delivering an outright iconic Obi-Wan Kenobi. Together they sell you the brotherhood of these two characters so well that by the end, you're throwing your money at them begging for more. The plot is so engaging, you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat as the events unfold, even though we've known for over 40 years what would happen. It'll have you laughing with the casually witty banter in the opening scene, and crying at the heartbreaking climax between Anakin and Obi-Wan. At the same time, John Williams creates some of his most iconic music since the originals. The sadness you feel as the orchestra and choir swell during Order 66 is immense. Throughout the film, the music is immersive, and plays a truly important role in the flow of the film. Lastly, this is a visually stunning film. The ILM team attempts some of their most ambitious effects to date, and the execution is perfect. The effects are flawless and convincing. Overall this is a truly great film. It is emotional, beautiful, and a perfect end to the saga. I think is is vastly misunderstood. This film, as well as the other prequels, were never meant to be like the originals. They're more poetic, more dramatic, and this film is the pinnacle of George Lucas' intentions. I rank it 3rd in the entire eleven film canon behind only A New Hope and Empire (of course). Even outside of Star Wars it is one of my favourite films of all time, it deserves some serious respect. It is a fun, exciting, heartbreaking story, and seeing the title scroll onto the screen at the beginning of the film always makes me smile. I truly do enjoy watching this film. Isn't that what makes a movie great?",

Let's start to say why I like this film: simply thanks to its good OST (at the same time John Williams) coupled with wonderful action scenes, a good representation of the conspiracies and political developments that there have been in course of our History (Republic [Roman, French, of Weimar] becomes Empire) and especially the great moments of emotions which begin little by little: Anakin does not want to drop Obi-Wan; Padmé reveals that she is pregnant; forgiveness of Anakin to Obi-Wan, Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader, Order 66, Obi-Wan discovers the massacre of the Padawans, Vader strangles his wife, the fight between the former master and apprentice, Vader burns under the gaze of 'Obi-Wan and finally the simultaneous sequences of the tapering of the armor and the birth of Padmé! Special mention to the reply that each child must repeat when playing Star Wars; I will comment on them later.\nSmall parenthesis. Before attacking what is annoying with this film, let us launch into the Prelogy. According to my personal tastes: III> VI> IV> V> I> II with regard to the Star Wars saga. Although I'm indifferent to episode II and find episode I just ... cute, I have to defend the Prelogy. Admittedly, I do not believe that it would have been necessary to make a prequel but here it is: SW is a saga of film for child, whether you believe it or not. That explains the Ewoks, Jar Jar Binks, Yoda the puppet, a bearded old fool, robotic comics-reliefs, etcteri etctera. And at the end of episode I, instead of growing up with the public of the Trilogy (as Harry Potter would have done), this episode is very childish (not immature, attention), you just have to listen to the music to to notice. On the other hand, the Prélogie, it grew with its fans. Episode II is for teens. And episode III is more adult. TO fans wanted to feel the emotions\nthey had but Lucas's goal was to introduce the new SW generation. And I'm not against it! That explains why the old people like the Trilo and the younger ones the Prélo.\n\nNow ROTS!\nAnti-Prelogy: \"The passage of Anakin to the dark side is done with a snap of a finger, especially after a\" What did I do? : '(\"\nTips4: \"He can go back to the Jedi with\" I was an accomplice in Mace Windu's death and I let the biggest criminal escape. \"In addition, Palpatine is like the surrogate father of 'Anakin'\nA-P: \"He still kills kids to save his wife.\"\nCd4: \"Padmé is only the disturbing element. He has a bitterness towards the Jedi. He insists that he is given a place on the board without becoming a Master more out of respect for traditions than out of arrogance (he matures between the episode 2 and 3), we want him to spy on his best friend, we still don't trust him, ect \"\nA-P: \"The actors play badly\"\nCd4: \"Thank you VF!

We see him struggle with Love over Power and lose to power.  In an epic final battle sequence, we watch the Empire and the Sith destroy the Jedi and Rebellion.  Obi-wan and Anakin have one of the best battles in the Star Wars movies and yet at times I still really love the Episode 1 final fight between Qui-gon Jinn and Obi-wan vs Darth Maul.  But not to be left out in episode 3 we see Mace Windu vs Emperor Palpatine in a brilliant battle scene.  And Yet while the jedi battle scenes are far better in these origin story movies all three fall just short of the original trilogy BUT a must watch for any Star Wars fan.  Episodes 1 - 6 are the best watch the new Episodes 7 thru 9 will greatly disappoint and make you hate Disney for killing Stars Wars for every.
