Sin City delves into the gangster underworld with 3 intertwined stories from Frank Miller's series of the same name. Offering up guns, violence, thrills and suspense. The cast do a great job especially as this was filmed all with the use of green screen. I don't think there is another film out there quite like Sin City where the comic/novel is brought to life off the page.",

Comprised of several adaptations of stories from Frank Miller's graphic novels, the plot is almost inconsequential when it comes to the enjoyment of the movie.  Like nothing before it, Sin City is an assault on the senses, consisting of consistently stunning visuals, remarkable effects, a fantastic score, brilliant cinematography, and an expansive cast, including the likes of Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Benicio del Toro, and Clive Owen, among others.  If you can manage to accept the fact that the stories themselves are almost dispensable and anything resembling character development is irrelevant, Sin City will be a viewing experience unlike anything else.",

Also, during the film, there are several characters who are faced with death but are given a second chance at life. After watching Sin City, it gave off a comic-like atmosphere throughout the film. One example of this would be how each frame is in black and white, and the background settings look like they are hand drawn as they would be in a comic. Another example would be any time blood from the fight scenes would appear in black and white instead of the color red. Also, after watching this film, it made me realize that it requires a mature type of audience. One example of this would be when a female is being raped by a pedophile. Another example of this would be when certain characters would be killed in gruesome ways. With some of these scenes, I would not recommend this film to the faint of heart audience members.",

            "content": "Usually, I am a movie addict; I love every genre, from comedy to action. However, this film did not quite stick with me as others have. If you have not yet seen Sin City, then be aware; spoilers are ahead! \n\n          Sin City, directed by Frank Miller, is a film based on the Sin City graphic novels. The movie was unique in a stylistic sense; however, I would not watch it again. To be transparent, I found the film so painfully dull and confusing that I could not make it to the end. Although the detailing within this movie proved to be interesting, the overall film was a bit hard to navigate. If you were to look away from your screen for more than one second, it felt like you missed an entire storyline. However, there is always good within the bad, so one exciting factor I pulled from this film was that it presented itself as a comic book through an actual movie setting. I have never seen this in a movie, so this was the only detail to capture my attention. Although my opinion stands, a few criteria stood out throughout reviewing this film: creativity, characters, and pacing.\n           One fascinating aspect of this movie is the overall creativity. When the film opens, we see a woman standing on a balcony. A man comes outside to conversate with her. The woman plays a character known as \"The Customer,\" and the man plays a character known as \"The Man.\" The Customer plays a significant part because not only is she the first character introduced, but through her character, we see the first appearance of color; her red dress. Considering that the film is in black and white, I found the color appearances remarkably interesting throughout the movie because color only appears through introducing a significant person or object. Anytime we see color, that object either gets damaged, the character dies, or becomes brutally wounded. Frank Miller honestly had an eye for creativity through producing this film.\n           The following form of criteria that I took notice of was the overall characters and their meaning. For example, John Hartigan appears in the first scene. To my understanding, John is a detective and one of the main protagonists in Sin City. John is an interesting character because he presents himself as more of a mysterious type. However, when an exciting character appears, they become killed off shortly after, or we never see them again. To my knowledge, Frank Miller implemented this detail to draw more attention to each character and recapture the audience's lost attention. Through this challenging detail and the literal film, we cannot come to a deep understanding of the characters or their life stories.\n           Finally, the last section of criteria that I noticed was the overall pacing of this film. This aspect ruined both the movie and the overall experience. From the beginning, if you did not listen closely or purposefully look for minor details, you would be completely lost once the central part of the scene occurred. For example, Goldie appears during the film's middle portion. Although her character's storyline ends shortly after being introduced, the storyline shift will quickly confuse you if you do not give your undivided attention to that scene. After Goldie dies, Her twin sister appears to torment a man named Marv; this detail completely lost my attention because, for the longest time, I could not tell if Goldie was still alive or if it was her ghost. It was never clear that she was her twin until the scene ended. I also believe that the movie did not have a set plotline. Throughout watching it, the characters switched out so often that it was challenging to keep up with who we were following and what plot to follow. Once one character appeared, it seemed you had only minutes to follow that storyline until another appeared. This cycle repeats itself multiple times throughout the movie, making it exceedingly difficult to finish.\n           Sin City is a film representing the Sin City graphic novels authored by Frank Miller. At first glance, the film looks quite interesting; the cover art makes you want to click on it straight away, leading the audience to believe that they are sitting down to watch an action-packed, exciting crime movie. In all honesty, my first assumption led me to believe that Sin City was a film almost like the television show Law and Order. However, I was met with great disappointment once diving into the movie. Although the creativity intrigued me, through the downfall of both the character style and the pacing, I lost interest quite quickly. My overall recommendation rating for this film is a solid 30%. The reason is that although some aspects were quite interesting, the movie presented no solid plotline, could not keep my attention, and was one of the most confusing films I had ever seen. I cannot judge the Sin City graphic novels because I have not read them, and sometimes the books are better than the films. However, considering this is only a film review, my opinion stands strong with not recommending this film to anybody interested in crime or action-related movies.",

            "content": "The movie Sin City is about four separate characters. This type of movie is called an anthology film. The one that stuck out to me the most was the second one about the cynical hero turned vigilante named Marv. He spends one beautiful night with a prostitute called Goldie. In the morning, he finds her dead next to him, so he sets on a journey to find her killer Cardinal Roark with her sister Wendy. Marv wants to punish him for taking away the one person that gave him attention other than his parole officer. \nWhat is interesting about the whole movie is that it was filmed in color but changed to black and white, this technique was used to portray the film's classic noir style. The filmmakers did this to make sure they kept with the original graphic novel's theme. In the movie, Goldie is all in color with dark red lips. At the time of the scene in the bed with Goldie, Marv talks about her beauty and how much of an angel she is. This is like what Scott McCloud talks about in Chapter 8 of Understanding Comics. He tells the readers about how the colors have an impact on the viewer's emotional ties to the text. We can take away from this scene that he obviously fell in love with her the first night he meets her. \nAnother interesting thing I noticed while watching this film was the choice of colors they used for the actions. For example, in the next story after Marv's, when the one woman is killing all the men in the car and the blood is white, but when she cuts the man's head off in the street, the blood is red that comes across her face. I think it is also interesting how all the characters come together by the end of the story, we learn how the whole city is affected by all these criminal acts.",

            "content": "Unsettling neo-noir with a gripping, dark tale!\n\nDirectors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller's neo-noir thriller Sin City (2005) adapts Miller's own graphic novel with a striking comic book style. It's impossible to describe just how striking Sin City is with its comic book and film noir aesthetic. Nothing looks like Sin City. I'm grateful for Rodriguez and Miller for directing their neo-noir masterpiece Sin City.\n\nFrank Miller's writing is truly depressing, but so well written as he can describe a woman like a grim alleyway and it sounds romantic. Tonally, Sin City goes from violence so brutal that it's camp to unreal darkness with the most grim storylines blended with Frank Miller's bleak outlook on life. Sin City will disturb you with Frank Miller's brutal violence and shockingly dark narrative, while you'll be amazed by how he fits three main narratives together into one hard boiled film noir for modern audiences. Sin City is like watching separate tragedies colliding together in the most gloriously entertaining way. It's sorrowful and blunt with Frank Miller's wondrous way with words.\n\nBruce Willis really gave it his all with a subtle dramatic performance as the tough honest Detective John Hartigan. It's nice to see Willis really care about a role with all the nuance of his best acting style. Jessica Alba is sultry and sexy as the stripper Nancy Callahan, but it's her earnest love for Willis and inner pain that impresses more than her obvious beauty. Michael Madsen's quietly menacing bad cop Bob is the perfect antithesis for Bruce Willis' good cop. His cavalier attitude is quietly neat next to Willis' serious dramatic performance. Powers Boothe is as mean and vindictive as the sleazy, corrupt Senator Roark as you'd imagine. Nick Stahl is haunting as Roark Jr. and the Yellow Man. He's so eerie that I can never get his creepy face and performance out of my mind.\n\nClive Owen is so cool as the brutally vicious Dwight McCarthy. His every move feels lethal. Rosario Dawson has a confident and dangerous allure to her as Gail with a commanding romantic passion for Clive Owen that feels real. Alexis Bledel's piercing blue eyes astonish me with her sterling performance as the lovely prostitute Becky. She's really excellent in Sin City and makes me wonder how she didn't get cast in more films. I loved the icy coolness of Devon Aoki's hitwoman Miho as she doesn't waste a movement as the gorgeous lady of the night.\n\nFurthermore, Benicio del Toro's forceful creep Jackie Boy is chilling from his compassionless deep voice to his sinister glare. He feels like Brittany Murphy's sweet waitress Shellie is in real danger. Murphy is so full of empathy for Shellie's poor life and luck with men as you see every bit of pain in Murphy's devastating eyes. She's breathtaking. Michael Clarke Duncan is pretty fun and intimidating as the police enforcer Manute.\n\nMickey Rourke is super rough and entertaining as the brute killer with a heart of gold called Marv. He's so in control of his every move and gravitas. Jaime King is drop dead gorgeous as both the sweet and mysterious Goldie and the viciously vengeful Wendy in Sin City. Her every glare and movement portray a stern fierceness that is hypnotizing throughout Rodriguez' film. Rutger Hauer's sleazy and revolting Cardinal Roark is intense and captivating. Carla Gugino is naturally beautiful as the parole officer Lucille with her nonchalant apathy to Marv's murders, while also giving a haunting and hysterical performance in the presence of Elijah Wood's stoic serial killer Kevin. Wood has never felt so evil with his swift movements and silent malice.\n\nJosh Hartnett gets to open Sin City and close the film as his enigmatic hitman The Salesman. He's perfect with every choice word delivered with a cold deadpan of a man accustomed to murder. Frank Miller cameos as the priest who is not so holy. Nick Offerman is funny as one of the side henchmen.\n\nEditor Robert Rodriguez manages to combine numerous plotlines into one massive neo-noir with a steady pace for 124 minutes. There's an uncut and extended edition I haven't seen, but I'm sure it adds some enthralling scenes, but the theatrical version is perfectly timed to just keep moving from kill to kill. Rodriguez also served as cinematographer. No one else could have filmed this movie like this and Sin City is as stylish as film gets. It visually looks like the old 1940's film noirs, while feeling distinctly modern in its sleekness. Everything pops from the splashes of red and yellow colors against the stark blacks and whites.\n\nChristopher Stull, Steve Joyner, Jeanette Scott, and Emmanuel Shiu's art direction looks straight out of Frank Miller's graphic novel with the haunting cityscapes, empty rooftops, pouring rainfall, and gritty streets. Jeanette Scott, David Hack, and Rob Simons' set designs are cool with an ethereal aura to every place because it doesn't feel real despite looking all too hard-edged. Robert Rodriguez, Mauricio Baiocchi, and Keefe Boerner's visual effects blast gunshots and knives into people like it's nothing and I love how all out Sin City goes.\n\nComposers Robert Rodriguez, John Debney, and Graeme Revell of The Crow fame wrote thrilling and moody music to fit Sin City's sleazy and forlorn vibe. Sure, Sin City is all naked women and rough men getting tortured and murdered, but it is inescapable. I find myself compelled to return to Frank Miller's world thanks to Rodriguez' passion in this project. It's very well made. Robert Rodriguez, Paula Fairfield, Craig Henighan, Sergio Reyes, and Tim Rakoczy all did the squishy, groaning, and bursting sound design that brings Sin City to life.\n\nI appreciate Nina Proctor, Annette Hoffman, and Brenda J. Chambers' classically stylish noir outfits for the men with raunchy, horny outfits for the ladies. Sin City is certainly lustful, whether it's for nude women or the bloodlust only sated by killing men. Ermahn Ospina, Joe Rivera, and Scott Patton's make-up is incredible as they transform Bruce Willis into a scarred hard-boiled cop, Mickey Rourke into a thuggish monster, and Benicio Del Toro into a two-bit mug.\n\nIn all, Sin City will be better appreciated in time once viewers revisit Frank Miller's relentless world of bullets and babes within Rodriguez' stellar visual directing style. Miller is a visionary and Rodriguez is an auteur, so them directing Sin City together gave us a real balance of pragmatic realness and out of this world visceral violence.",

            "content": "Sin City is a deeply satisfying, woefully artistic, technologically revolutionary and well-written movie, adapted directly from some revolutionary graphic novels in what might be the most direct 1-to-1 Translation in the history of the medium.  This movie looks like an Ultra-HD Graphic Novel but in full motion, implementing artistic trappings impossible to achieve without lots of Post-Production trickery, something that all-too-often drags a movie down, but here elevates it up onto of the greatest Cinematic Artistic achievements of that decade, at times looking like a living painting.  Throw in outrageous amounts of brutal violence and more than a healthy dose of pitch-black humor, and you've got a genuine masterpiece of a movie.  If there was any real problem with the movie, it's really just that the Universe the story takes place in can't quite keep its own rules entirely straight - the Hero of one Story is put into a coma due to receiving a couple of gunshots, whereas the Hero of a different Story is able to not only take numerous gunshots AND direct impacts from vehicles, but he's also able to jump down large distances and highjack cars by smashing through the windshields, making these two characters feel like members of an entirely different species.  Also, the mid part of the movie does loose a bit of steam as it's the longest-winded in its storytelling, and plays out around the time that the audience has finally gotten over the brilliance of the spectacle.  But all 3 Stories are very well told, and the movie's thick atmosphere and deeply satisfying conclusions, make this an absolute must see, so long as you don't have problems with Hard-R Rated subject matter and content.",

As of 2020, this movie has aged poorly. It's interesting how directors like Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez like to have strong female characters and the guys consider themselves feminists, yet their movies have relentless violence and abuse towards women, along with constant objectification of women. There are also some popcorn connections, since Mickey Rourke and Benicio Del Toro were in the MCU, and Jessica Alba was in Fantastic Four.

It has a look that is one-of-a-kind and it truly embraces the dark art style of the graphic novels. I think the integration of the occasional color inside the black-and-white world is a dazzling way of focusing attention on certain things (even if it didn\u2019t always make narrative sense to me why they chose those things to highlight.) There was a strange juxtaposition of retro cars with modern guns, and the language also seemed to be a mix of classic and modern. I\u2019m not sure this made any sense, but it fit with the visual aesthetic they were creating for this world. I also appreciate the short story structure, because even if there is a story you don\u2019t like, it doesn\u2019t linger for long. I wish there was even more intertwining of the stories, aside from the occasional character popping up, because I\u2019ve always been a fan of those kind of clever details linking a film together. It seemed like the only overriding theme that connected the entire film together was the miserable existence of every single person in this city, and the gruesome violence that ended most of their lives. What I didn\u2019t like about Sin City was that it seemed to take everything to the extreme. It was all exaggerated too much, and that rarely worked for me. The stories are all dark and gritty and real, but then we have people shattering doors to splinters with one kick or jumping from 4th-story windows and landing smoothly on their feet. The two tones don\u2019t work in the same world, and they lead me to chuckle instead of being engaged by the drama. The whole thing is also intended to have a strong neo-noir feeling to it, and that is most evident in the constant voiceover. There are times when that works to flesh out a story, but these aren\u2019t complex plots that require that level of exposition. I also started to wonder if the voice coach for this film was just a bag of gravel the actors all had to gargle, because it seemed to be a competition to see who could be the deepest and most grumbly-voiced. You know it\u2019s bad when I started to question if Benicio Del Toro was supposed to be the same character as Mickey Rourke, but they sounded so similar. I think Sin City was an ambitious idea, and I didn\u2019t actively dislike it, but many of the choices they made didn\u2019t work for me.",

The amount of effort and intricacy that has gone into the style alone is quite awe-inspiring; with its ingenious use of colours to show characteristics or themes about characters adding a great deal to the excellent tone the film sets for itself. All the performances are wonderful too, and the lead trio of Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen outdo themselves, and my expectations, in their respective segments. As this is a movie of three tales, it only makes sense to judge each one of them separately. 'That Yellow Bastard' was my favourite by quite some stretch. Not only was Willis excellent, but it has the most heartening and emotionally resonant story; and the way it both started and ended the movie was rather poignant also. Next, Rourke's 'The Hard Goodbye'. This was probably the most intriguing of the three stories, and I thoroughly enjoyed it; even though I think it went on a little too long. Finally, and the weakest of the three in my opinion - 'The Big Fat Kill'. Clive Owen is great, and a standout in the whole film, but this particular storyline just felt a little...empty. It had some great moments, but it dragged at times and by the end of it I was no more enlightened than I was at the start. All in all though, 'Sin City' is one helluva ambitious project, and both Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller must be commended for pulling off what on paper seemed almost an impossible task - creating, in effect, a live action animation.",

And it's an entertaining film with a shit load of style, I love how certain things are in color, even though it's a black and white film. Allthough, it looks sometimes cartoonish, some of the special effects too. This movie reminds me a lot of Tarantino's fabulous Pulp Fiction (1994), it has the same idea of an anthology crime film where the different stories interlock.

This is a visual spectacle,complemented by great action sequences as well as many outstanding performances. The stories keep their horror-esque feel all the way through. The music seals the unsettling atmosphere which further makes you interested in the world. It's not so much the stories which attract me so much,it's the breathing and living universe of sin and rotting moral we're thrown in,that really made invested.

It just pains me that most of these actors were never even in the same room with each other. I'd venture to call that an editor's dream.\n\nThis film is 4 stories that not only interlay well but broke the mold at the same time. It is like the remake of psycho in a way that is it a 100% accurate depiction of its source material. It broke the mold of digital filming at the time and was so different to our eyes even though it was simply black and white. When colors are used, it seems to fit the mood perfect. It took a truly ensemble cast and translated Frank Millers work beautifully. It also seems a lot like Planet Terror in how they stuck to a genre, the embodiment of noir. \n\nThis movie made Robert Rodriguez even more of a pioneer. It is bloody like a Tarantino movie. Also, it isn't in chronological order, which is another staple of Quentin.  It is over dramatic and perfectly cartoony. The pulpy way it plays was interesting and Frank Millers early works will always be classic. Never personally was too big of a fan, but I understand the accomplishments of the film.",

Never before have I witnessed such a beautifully rendered visual style on screen. The sharp black and white look with some striking colors throughout makes this a movie that, as clich\u00e9d as it sounds, feels like watching the pages of Frank Miller's graphic novel come to life. But even taking away that style, the movie still works for its extremely memorable characters and simple but engaging stories. Rodriguez has employed some of the best actors in the business with each bringing their A-game regardless of the size of their role. My personal favorite is Elijah Wood as the homicidal killer Kevin who manages to be extremely bone-chilling without saying a single word and with only about five minutes of screentime. Each story is well written (which of course owes much of that to Miller's original writing) and clear cut with solid characters and motivations. They work individually and as part of the larger narrative. In my humble opinion, That Yellow Bastard is the best (and most disturbing) and The Long Goodbye is the weakest (mainly for a few minor lingering plot points). But perhaps most importantly, Sin City is a film that radiates confidence. By confidence I mean that it's so sure of itself in its look, storytelling, performances, and enthusiasm that it gives the film that extra special element that is lacking in many other similar products. What could've been all style and no substance manages to be a happy medium of both. The end result is a special movie that it infinitely enticing.

One must not even remotely try to compare it with reality and just take it as comic book entertainment where unimaginable things can happen. The narrative consists of 4 short story-lines linked together in a particular sequence, similar to Pulp Fiction. Yet, it fails to achieve the same level of excellence with clich\u00e9d script and overly stylized action. I saw the directors extended cut where each of the 4 stories are completely separated, you can go for it if you can handle the long credits after each story (which was ridiculous). \n\nThe first story 'That Yellow Bastard' follows the story of Hartigan (Bruce Willis), an honest cop who is in danger after facing off with the corrupt senators son. The second 'The Customer is always right' wont make any sense till you see the entire film. The third 'A Hard Goodbye' follows Marv (Mickey Rourke), a bad-ass hunk who is almost impossible to kill. He plans to get rid of a even more horrific cannibal-killer Kevin (Elijah Wood). The last one, 'The Big Fat Kill', follows Dwight (Clive Owen) who has to handle a delicate situation between cops and the kick-ass girls of Old Town. The ones with Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke were the best. Acting wise the cast is fabulous and has the commendable job. There are lots of things you need to link in order to get a proper linked story out of the 4 stories and the sequel (A dame to kill for). I would recommend forget it and just enjoy each story individually as in the end all of it wont make preach you anything. Everything is to be perceived only as entertainment nothing else. The level of violence is extreme. Each character feels like a nihilist. A persons head is smashed to pulp with bare hands, a mans hands and legs are cut and is fed to wolf alive. If you can handle such violence well and good, else don't bother to watch. The visual style of black & white with color to highlight works well with the neo-noir theme of the film. The dialogues feel a bit too cheesy at times and action sequences unrealistic. Anyways its just a comic book adaptation. Just enjoy it like that.\n\nRATING: [3.5/5]",

It was a matter of time that he will direct/collaborated with another director to create a shot for shot adaptation and the work he selected as the source material would be \"Sin City\".\n\"Sin City\" is a collection of short stories set in the infamous Sin City, a city that lives up to it's named as it's filled with corruption, murders, prostitution, antiheroes and violence. \nRobert Rodriguez is a perfect match for Frank Miller\u00b4s over the top, dark and his tone that takes itself too seriously so \"Sin City\" looked like a promising experiment that ultimately succeeds but that doesn't mean it is a great film. \"Sin City\" is a peculiar experiment that counts with some fun to watch performances with the stand outs being Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen being the most entertaining actors onscreen, the inventive use of CGI backlot that is the ultimate reason why this film is remember for as it creates the perfect atmosphere where this ridiculously over the top stories could happen, arguably Rodriguez best directing job to date (got to be clear: Best directing, not best film) and the only time Miller has ever worked in the directing chair, some incredible visuals, plenty of memorable scenes, a remarkably executed noir style and enormous entertaining value. But even with all those creative elements, \"Sin City\" is just another comic book vigilante film. The stories are forgettable, the characters are nothing more than comic book stereotypes, its filled with Frank Miller\u00b4s ego as it counts with every single one of his ridiculous tropes (hookers are portray as vigilantes, the antiheroes, a city filled with crime and corruption, over the top violence, \"badass\" villains, etc.), a cartoony vibe that takes away any sense of danger throughout the film, laughable dialog, an absurd and unnecessary use of violence at times, some actors are wasted in roles that don't really do much, the extensive use of unnecessary monologues take away some of the charmed this noir film could have had, and the experience this film offers is ultimately emotionless due to the fact there is not a single sympathetic character.\n\"Sin City\" is a gorgeously shot, entertaining and stylistic film that's the ultimate example of \"style over substance\". Sure, it is a fun movie but it really doesn't deserved all the praised it receives; if you take away the visual style, this film has nothing more to offer that hasn't been offer before in other adaptations of Miller's work.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nSin City has blown people's minds during its release in 2005, and time has passed and many still hail it as one of the greatest films of its decade. I was certainly impressed by it, when I first saw it all those years ago; but time has passed and since then I have grown and my expectations for cinema as a whole has developed with a sense of maturity, therefore Frank Miller's Sin City has lost a bit of its impact on me during my recent viewing.\n\nSin City features four, loosely, interconnected stories that explores themes of corruption, murder, revenge, justice, and innocence. The story is certainly easy to follow and identifiable characters but beyond its surface, the film fails to deliver anything thought provoking with its themes. The film naturally draws its audience into its dark and terrifying world, but without any impact from the film's themes, the world and its plot simply felt hollow. It also does not help that the film features dialogue that sits in the borderline of being genuinely inspired and tiresome; with every amazing line, it counters with words that would make one sigh and roll their eyes as the statement being said was so obvious that I was distracted and taken aback from Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's world and characters.\n\nThe film fortunately was able to carry its weight through its visual and stylistic designs. The film does a wonderful job in recreating Frank Miller's black and white comic book, acting as a throwback to the elements of noir during the first half of the 20th century. There were actually a couple of moments in this film, where my mind paused for a second just to take in the gorgeous visuals. Though the spoken dialogue of the film left me disappointed, the internal monologue, however, was fantastic; it gave a three dimensional quality to the protagonists, aiding the audience in establishing these characters as heroes rather than anti-heroes.\n\nRobert Rodriguez's ensemble cast was quite pleasing to watch, particularly Mickey Rourke. Rourke brought this hard grit to his role's personality, allowing his character to flourish in every frame he steps on. The rest of the cast may not reach the excellence that Rourke brought, but they definitely still showed a sense of commitment; cherishing the role that they were playing. If the cast brought a less than stellar performance, then it would have been difficult for the audience to be convinced of the city's intended darkness and sense of corruption.\n\nI cannot see myself losing further admiration for Robert Rodriguez's Sin City as its visuals are simply too well executed for me to not appreciate; but due to its recent emerging flaws, I cannot glorify the film as I once did.",

The characters are likable, yet flawed, and every line from them is golden. Despite their flaws, each of them have a moral code that they stick to, and provides a guide to living your life like a man; Marv is the most entertaining character in this film.

Instead of being something compelling and artistically interesting, every element from the art to the characters and dialogue is at the lowest levels of cartoon. I could only sit through about 10 minutes before I had as much of this stupid bullshit as I could take.  This movie exhibits a self-satisfied, preening and aggressive stupidity that is depressing.  Some may think Sin City is a throwback, but in its nature it is closer to Freddy Got Fingered than to La Confidential.  I haven't read the comic this is adapted from, and I now have no interest in doing so.  The spirit of this film is not mind-numbing in its stupidity, it is corrosive.  It exemplifies so much of what is wrong with popular/fanboy culture today.  It does fit in with the rest of the hack-tastic Robert Rodriguez catalog, but it is a disappointing waste of good acting talent.  It has been annoying to see that they made a sequel to this embarrassment.",

            "content": "Basic: Sin City has three separated comic book stories. The first one is \"The Hard Goodbye\", of where Marv (played by Mickey Rourke) a barfly/ex-convict is getting revenge on a prostitute she loved, Goldie (played by Jamie King). The second one is \"The Big Fat Kill\", of where Dwight (played by Clive Owen) who's a private detective put an army of hookers in Sin City, which is headed by Gail (played by Rosario Dawson), in serious trouble, after tangling an corrupted cop name Jackie Boy (played by Benicio Del Toro). The third and last one is \"That Yellow Bastard\" that focuses on an old disgraced cop (played by Bruce Willis), who's trying to save the life of a dancer, Nancy (played by Jessica Alba) from a sadistic sexual predator, Roark Jr. (played by Nick Stahl). \n\nWhat's the deal: Now I notice that Robert Rodriguez is a filmmaker of where he makes grown-up movies over-the-top and I would say that it's full of blood and guts in it, and when he makes kids movies, he does it both childish and cartoonish, which I do have a problem with that because I don't like watching movies that are very cartoonish. As for Sin City, I do believe that it is the best film that he has ever done. It is a grown-up movie that does come off over-the-top, but there are a lot of things to really like about it. First, the visuals are really both colorful and beautiful. It has that same look like in the comic book and it also tell it in a very film-noir comic book way. Second, the characters are interesting to watch, and even the evil characters as well. Like, Elijah Wood's character, Kevin, who's so demented, and he doesn't say a word in the film, but still, I do like this evil character that he played. Mickey Rourke's performance is amazing and plays the character, Marv very well, and I do find his character actually humorous than the rest of the characters in the film. Third, I really do like all of these three separates stories. They're as interesting as the characters, and my favorite one out of all these three stories for me is \"The Big Fat Kill\" because it gotten more of my attention on how things gotten worse and worse in that story. Now, here's the only flaw that I have in this movie is its storytelling. I mean, I really do like all of these three stories, but the way how Robert Rodriguez does it from one story to another just feels kind of off, or I would say kind of a failure, but for almost everything in that film, it felt great to me.\n\nMy full opinion: Sin City's storytelling does feel kind of off, but it is visually groundbreaking, and both the characters and its stories are interesting enough to make Sin City as one of the best graphic novel adaptation I've seen. 9.2/10",

Nonetheless, i couldn't stop watching, and when the stories all tied in at the end I was overwhelmingly pleased. \n\nThe script is so deliberate and moves effortlessly throughout the well-paced story. And the direction is so well orchestrated as well. The performances are hit or miss, but all work for each respective character. While I'm not terribly partial to the shock-value stuff that Rodriguez is so well known for, I was able to see past it since the narrative was so captivating.\n\nAlthough too graphic for many, Sin City immerses you in its fiction and demands your attention as you never see what it has in store for you around the corner.\n\nTwizard Rating: 96",

You may think that there being so many characters may make the plot line fairly confusing, actually its almost at the other end of the spectrum; it is very easy to follow. This is mad easier by the fact that the plot is split into three different sections much like Pulp Fiction making it very easy to follow and a very engaging storyline. Now you can't talk about Sin City without talking about the very particular art style, it is based on a graphic novel so it is almost as if they have taken the action straight from a page and based the whole film around that art. The result of this is gorgeous and creates a wonderful atmosphere filled with action. Overall this film is a must see, you need to watch this and we are hoping the next one is just as good.",

The visuals are fantastic and makes the comic book aspect of the movie work on a high level. The action scenes are over the top which is kind of one of the flaws in the movie. Also, the over the top dialogue and acting are a flaw in the movie as well. The narrations are serious and delivers to the audiences in a high level. The movie itself is very suspenseful, unpredictable, entertaining, and very graphic which makes the movie four times as better! The character's personalities are unique and enjoyable. You care for the characters as a whole and actually for sympathy for them by learning about their back stories and what happens to them in the long run. All the actors in the movie are actually trying and putting in an effort to become these characters in the movie like Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Benico Del Toro, Jessica Alba, ect. Overall, the movie does suffer some flaws with some plot holes, over acting because of the Dialogue, and the over the top action scenes. I will give 'Sin a City' an A- grading!",

The cast was absolutely awesome, especially Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, and Clive Owen!!  They were so incredible!!  Point blank!!  Mickey Rourke gave the most intense performance though!! The directors (Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller) make a dynamic duo and with director (Quentin Tarantino) being a guest director just makes it more exciting!!  If you are a fan of Frank Miller's work, than this will feel like Christmas!!  If you do not like his work, than this is not for you!!

            "content": "Sin City the movie is based on the first, third, and fourth books in Frank Miller's graphic novel series. With some extra smaller segments at the beginning and end of the movie starring Josh Hartnett, taken from the fifth book in the series, Booze, Broads & Bullets. The three main stories take place over roughly the same period of time, and are set in and around the violent crime ridden hell hole called Basin City. A cold and bleak place in the American west, where corrupt politicians and powerful religious leaders buy lazy cowardly cops to do their bidding. Where serial child killers and cannibals run free as long as they have the right connections.\n\nEach story has a strong yet flawed anti-hero type trying to do the right thing. Save a little girl from a serial killer or hunt down a girlfriends murderer, or even kill a corrupt cop and save an area of the city run by prostitutes from the mob. Light on laughs, but loaded with style, Sin City is pretty much the pages of Frank Miller's graphic novels at 24 frames per second. Shot mostly in high-contrast black and white, with occasional additions of bright color, this film quite frankly is amazing to look at.\n\nIt's true there isn't much to relate to in this film, and to be honest I thought the development of all the lead characters, except Hartigan (Bruce Willis), was somewhat lacking in detail and depth. I also think the film is a little too long, but what it lacks in character development, it makes up with its great casting, performances and visual style. Mickey Rourke is quite frankly awesome as the nearly indestructible thug, Marv, and Bruce Willis is great in his stories, 'That Yellow Bastard' Parts 1 and 2.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you enjoy movies with a lot of visual style then this is the film for you. The movie earns its R rating by being incredibly violent. It's very stylized violence, but the manner in which some characters are dispatched is still quite shocking. This movie also doesn't provide any big finales, and even the positive elements in each story still feel a little tragic somehow.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThis is a great looking film so if you have the opportunity to see it at the theater - do it. At home a HD viewing on nothing smaller than your big screen TV is the way to go.\n\nBest Element:\n\nMy favorite story in the film stars Mickey Rourke in awesome form as the medicated thug with a heart of gold, Marv. Big, ugly, nearly indestructible and on the prowl to find his girls killer. This segment also includes a really creepy performance by Elijah Wood as the cannibalistic serial killer Kevin.\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/sin-city-2005/\n\nhttp://facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://twitter.com/talkiegazette",

            "content": "Sin City is a weird movie to review because you cannot critique it like a normal film.  It isn't structured or in the style of your typical movie.  Of all the comic book/superhero flicks I have seen thus far Sin City is the one film that truly does seem like a comic book come to life.  The look, characters, and especially the action is very much like a comic book and not reality which was what the makers were going for.  The film has a very unique style.  It's shot in mostly black & white, it has these weird comic sketches every now and then, and the atmosphere and narration is reminiscent of a classic film noir.  The still is probably what gripped most people (including myself) when they saw it, because the story (or stories in this case) and characters aren't much.  The acting had a big hand in it as well I'm sure.  You have a stellar cast like Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Michael Clarke Duncan just to name a few.  Everyone gives it their all and they do great.  You do not see actors, you see the people of Sin City.\nThe real main character of this movie is really Sin City itself.  Frank Miller loves to develop his cities as actual characters.  The stories taking place as well as the lead characters and villains is really to develop and primary character, Sin City.  I did really get sucked in to the style of this film.  The cast played a big role as well.  I was invested in the lead characters and wanted to see them come out on top.  The film is not for everyone however.  First of all, do not take this too seriously.  If come in expecting logic as far as reality is concerned you are going to hate this film.  The movie is also very violent and gory despite a significant amount of the violence being stylized.  This is not for the squeamish.\nOverall, for what it was, Sin City is a great ride.  It is not something I would watch all the time so I won't give it a perfect score.  If I wanted to watch a fun a popcorn movie this would not be first on my list.  You have to be in the mood to watch this because it is quite graphic and a bit depressing.  If you haven't seen this film yet and want to see a film that is in a different style from the norm then check this out.  If you do not mind graphic violence or nudity then you should like it.  Do not look for a very deep story or expect it to be at all like reality.",

            "content": "Frank Miller's comics/illustrated novels, have continually been dark, gritty and extremely unique in a visual sense. So imagine going back almost ten years ago, when it was announced that, one of his biggest selling books, Sin City, was not only going to be made, but he was going to co direct. At the time, it was something very little of us had seen before, much abused afterwards in creating other Frank Miller worlds, it boasted a mix of CGI and in camera effects, to give a living breathing comic strip. An experience that did not intrude and constantly distract but more envelop you as a viewer. This is down to two very important factors, its cast and Robert Rodriguez. Back when news of a Rodriguez film didnt fill your heart with dread, he was on his A game, providing comic book violence in a real world, it was almost like he was born to make this film. His credentials also managed to lock in quite a cast, which without this film would disintegrate very quickly. Sin City revolves around three of the Frank Miller novels, That Yellow Bastard, The Hard Goodbye and The Big Fat Kill. At the heart of each of these stories are three male protagonists, Hartigan, Marv and Dwight, three extremely dangerous, flawed but somehow caring citezans of Basin City, a city full of despair, crime, drugs, pedophiles and rapists. The film weaves the stories together seemlessly, offering up depravity upon depravity. Hartigan's story tells us of a retired cop, struggling to save a young girl from a pedophile son of a senator. Dwight follows a face changing criminal, who ends up in the middle of a war and has to side with the prostitutes of Basin City and finally Marv, who is framed for the murder of a high class call girl by two sickening cannibals. Its heavy stuff, thematically and visually. The cast are the important mould here, super stellar performances from Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Brittany Murphey, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood and Nick Stahl, mixed with strong performances by Clive Owen, Devon Aioki, Josh Heartnett and Rutger Haur, leaving a couple of actors just dwindling in the dark really, for example Michael Madsen, who just doesnt comfortably suit into his small role, what so ever. Jessica Alba also has very little to do, being such a big character in the film, she ends up being just a damsel in distress. However as an ensemble they work magic, Narration from the three protagonists is perfect. Bruce Willis currently trying to prove to himself he isnt worthless as he tries to safe Jessica Alba from being raped is strong stuff, much like Marv's psychotic determination to bring the people who killed the love of his life to justice, even if he is imagening the whole thing. Clive Owen's narration is strong as well, its just he has little to play with, lucky for him Tarintino guest directs a scene with him and Del Toro that saves his entire sequence. Visually, if this were any other film it would be a horrendous and lazy cluster fuck of imagery but for the most part here, the blend between CGI and in camera works a joy, giving you a real sense of the world that its portraying. Awkward angles, brilliant tracking shots and some nice touches of colour here and there make the visuals stand out even more. There are moments when a characters lips will sheen violent red which clashes so harsh against the black and white it oozes sexy and noir. Its not all visually delightful though, the film has the odd moment where you wonder if they either ran out of time and just flung some parts in. A sequence where Marv tools up to go into battle just seems lazy and the final scene where a shamed prostitute meets her inevitable demise just reeks of last minute, which is a shame because these moments are really not needed in the film. The pacing is glorious also, each character may only have brief moments on screen but they light it up, meaning that every moment is an enjoyable romp. The edits are clean cut and on the ball, the score is pouncing and gets you right in the mood for the blood thirsty noir your watching. It is however not completely perfect. Some of the CGI, the cars mostley, have dated horribly, at points things feel slightly too rushed, i understand this is a two hour long film but a bit more time, could have gave actors such as Jessica Alba, just a bit more time to shine. Finally, some of the dialogue is just down right stupid, at one point Rosario Dawsons character in agast by the fact Marv broke out of her rope tying ability, replying with \"Ropes are my specialty\" it gets the laughs sure, it just seems jarring in between moments of sheer desperation. Not everyones cup of tea, women are heavily sexualised, violent, gory and with themes that are not for the weak stomached, this film will put a lot of people off, then again, if your going to make a film called Sin City, you really need to go balls out.",

The stories are really good, but I didn't find them that gripping, and as interesting as the effects. The ensemble casting are great, the action is good, and it holds no grounds of the violence. It does look like something from a comic book, even though this is based on the comic series, which is fine, but can be cheesy and campy. But for this, it really works and it doesn't feel campy nor cheesy. Although I don't find it a masterpiece as some people do think, it's a visual splendor film that really succeed in not making it \"style over substance.\"",

            "content": "SIN CITY. A dark, brutal and gripping adaptation of the outstanding comics made by Frank Miller,  who not also writes and co-directs this film with Robert Rodriguez, but also has a brief role as a corrupt priest. Based in a fictitious town nicknamed 'Sin City', Marv (Mickey Rourke) John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) and many other people's lives interconnect with each other as they all go through an epic tale of death, love and misery. Following an anthology format, the film goes through 4 different tales, 2 of which are in parts.\r\n\r\nThe story goes as John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) attempts to save eleven year old girl Nancy Callahan from being raped by Roark Junior, the son of Senator Roark. After, it moves to Marv's perspective, now planning to take revenge for the death of Goldie. The last tale is of Dwight and the gang of prostitutes who now face a new danger, the danger of a violent war between their rivals.\r\n\r\nBeing the kind of brutal film it was, I thought it wouldn't be the good film that it was, seeing as all the brutal, violent films never really turn out OK, however seeing it on my TV guide with nothing else to see, I thought I'd finally change my mind for once, and it was only then that I surprised myself because Sin City was a riveting spiral of suspense, with great directing, courtesy of Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, breathtaking and ground-breaking visual, with fantastic rays of black and white, it made the film look elegant, I really felt as if I were watching an actual comic book.\r\n\r\n The graphics was the first thing I loved about the film, and the first thing I was shocked with. With a terrific script and with the finely tuned scenes of violence, with it being very brutal, I still loved it as it only added more to the greatness of this film, this film is truly a great telling of the dark world Frank Miller has created.\r\n\r\nWith a great cast including Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba (who doesn't like her?), Rosario Dawson, Elijah Woods and Clive Owen, they perform exquisitely with every detail supplementing to the success of the film, the make-up is also terrific, with Mickey Rourke's face looking every bit as his comic counterpart, I want to also say again that the graphics are beautiful.\r\n\r\nWinning awards such as the MTV Movie Award for Sexiest Performance (thank you Jessica Alba) and Mickey Rourke won a Saturn Award, an Online Film Critics Society Award, a Chicago Film Critics Association Award, and an Irish Film & Television Award for his performance. Roger Ebert himself gave the film 4 out of 4 stars describing this film as \"a visualization of the pulp noir imagination, uncompromising and extreme. Yes, and brilliant.\r\n\r\nThe film was great, I loved every bit of it, anyone who wants to watch it should definitely do that, and this great, Neo-Noir action film is worth every single minute wasted. No-one, I repeat No-One back or shy away from this film because it is brilliant! As a fellow reviewer, trust me when I say it deserves it's fresh rating, watch this film. From me it gets a 90% rating, I cannot wait to see Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For.",

Instead of being something compelling and artistically interesting, every element from the art to the characters and dialogue is at the lowest levels of cartoon. I could only sit through about 10 minutes before I had as much of this stupid bullshit as I could take.  This movie exhibits a preening and aggressive stupidity that is depressing.  Some may see Sin City as a throwback to noire, but in its nature it is closer to Freddy Got Fingered than to LA Confidential.   I haven't read the comic this is adapted from, and I now have no interest in doing so.  The spirit of this film is not merely mind-numbing in its stupidity, it is corrosive.  It exemplifies so much of what is wrong with popular/fanboy culture today.  It does fit in with the rest of the hack-tastic Robert Rodriguez catalogue, but it is a waste of good acting talent.",

The movie also lacks any sense of danger, due to the fact that it's characters only die when required to by the story and are virtually indestructible otherwise, reducing the film's admittedly well shot action to a device that fills up the run time and distracts ADD audience members until the current story ends and the next one begins. If you just want to see the same pointlessly brutal and revenge fueled action in a cool looking comic book style, with nothing else to it, for two hours then I'd recommend Sin City to you. For those looking for something deeper and less redundant, look elsewhere.",

The darkly ambiguous characters help to paint a picture of a truly bleak world, where the morality one's actions is left to your imaginations. The film looks like a film noir with a distinct, graphical novel style, with only occasional use of colour. The special effects aren't always good, but then again, this is the kind of film that focuses on substance rather than glamour.

He's got the visual style down to the tee, it feels like a comic book rather than a movie, and where that might be a negative in other cases it's a giant plus for a movie like this. The use of color and CGI is wonderful. Miller's writing is great (with a few exceptions where he breaks some rules), with the graphic novel-esque inner monologues pulsing the story along. Rodriguez makes one mistake that hold this film back majorly: casting. Specifically Jessica Alba was bad, but even worse were the extras. The extras used (the grunts and police officers) were almost all horribly hammy and just too goofy in all the wrong ways. And reportedly Tarantino directed one scene for a dollar.

The characters all have very deep personalities and the film is done in a way that you can really come to terms with how these people struggle to survive and protect the ones they love in the most dire of circumstances.

            "content": "Sin City Extended Edition (2005) - 8,5\r\n\r\n4 little stories (one of them being a mini story) in the Neo-noir atmosphere of Sin City. I have mixed feelings about this movie. Not regarding the moral paradigma behind the stories of course, but about some cinematic aspects.. I really like the Neo-noir concept recreated here and there's a lot to apprecciate in this movie - the intelligent monologues of the protagonists, the noir atmosphere carved by the unique and interesting cinematography and colour treatment, the smart and mastertful way how the several plots develop, etc...\r\n\r\nBut... this is the sort of cinema that ideally transports the viewer into a different world, a fantasy, a dreamlike experience and this movie fails to do so (with me) on a consistent level and as a result it falls short of what I'd consider deserving of reverence. As I watched the movie I often found myself distracted and annoyed by an apparent amateurish nature and/or lack of skill in some technical aspects. I'm talking primarilly about some of the acting and sound work, things here could had been a lot more polished. For example, several characters didn't leave up to the demands of the movie, it seemed like some actors and actresses didn't give enough commitment or that they simply lacked the acting skills for their roles, they looked fake, forced, not authentic at all. The sound design and editing also lacked, in my opinion, as it often failed to immerse me into the Neo-noir atmosphere of the movie, I feel that this aspect was overlooked. Being a multi-plot movie, these shortcomings affected each story by different degrees and I felt that \"The Big Fat Kill\" was the worse case. It was by far the one I least cared for, pretty boring and little of interest, I often couldn't help but gaze away and sigh due to the lack of polishment in the aforementioned and several other aspects. The plot itself was also the least interestingly developed and the end was... well, uneventful and boring despite what it was... I just didn't feel like I was watching the same movie as the other stories at all... the character played by Benicio Del Toro was probably the only one remotely interesting to observe in \"The Big Fat Kill\".\r\n\r\n\"The Hard Goodbye\" is a complete 180\u00ba turn though. I really liked this one, it was my favorite and if I had to score it alone, it'd be a solid 9. The main character is a brutal and amazeballs badass monster guy expertly played by Mickey Rourke, great work here! most of the acting in this story is pretty competent and the plot masterfully develops at the right pace and the sound design didn't let me down too much. This was definitely the immersive and dreamlike Neo-noir experience Sin City movie was supposed to be. The only oddity in my opinion was the character played by Elijah Wood... cmon man really?? so pathetic and amateurish looking!, it could had spoiled it all, but fortunately the overall work in \"The Hard Goodbye\" was solid and high quality so this nuissance didn't detract my enjoyment so much, but still it's the only stronger reason why I wouldn't give this single story a 10 if I had to.\r\n\r\nOn a general note special effects also looked excessively weird and unpolished a bit to often, it's just a small detail but nonetheless still has it's detracting influence on the screen.\r\n\r\nI feel that the consistency of Sin City is damaged by the lack of consistency between the several stories that form the whole movie, but maybe it's unrealistic to expect the same quality standard throughout so many different plots and such big cast with a \"mere\" 40 million USD budget... Laying my thoughts on the available resources and the technical challenges present in the creation of this work I can see how this film may have been too ambitious for it's own good... I ansiously look forward to the next Sin City film and I hope it doesn't disapoint it's own aspirations.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just saw this movie again and I feel I didn't give it fair credit. I revise the rating to 8,5 and take back my negative words on the sound work. The sound work is actually remarkable, what the hell was in my head when I wrote the previous comments I don't know... I guess I didn't fully understand the movie at first... \"The Yellow Bastard \" story is the most polished work, it's beautiful, but my favourite is still \"The Hard Goodbye\". Unfortunately my view towards \"The Big Fat Kill\" haven't changed much, actually most of the things that I negatively criticise are confined to this part. I wish they hadn't included this story in the film because it really detracts from the overall positive impression I have of the movie. This would easily become one of my favorite films of all time if they hadn't screw it up with \"The Big Fat Kill\". It's still a beautiful movie!",

What I loved from the writing was that it followed three different characters with their own personalities ultimately giving a new perspective on theme without it being horribly convenient.  So when reincorporation's in the movie happened it had a much more powerful effect on me.  It was also great how they orchestrated those reincorporation's being that they weren't merely planted for the explicit purpose of bringing back up.  Visual Sin City is brilliant; even attempting to think how they used selective color throughout the film is pretty mind-boggling.  It's as if you're watching a motion comic before your eyes.  If I had to make a complaint with the movie, it's that Marv's story is so amazing it kind over shadows the other two.  I'm not saying they aren't great, which they are, just not as entertaining as Marv's.  Lastly, I don't have to make the excuse that just because it's a comic book movie it deserves extra credit to be great because all together this is a masterful film.  9/10",

The next is to do with Brice Willis's character Hartigan as he tries to save a erotic dancer Nancy Callahan from pedophile Roark Junior, however my favourite story Mickey Rourke's as Marv, as he goes on a revenge path after a hooker who he just slept with named Goldie is murdered. I loved this storyline as it reminded me of Kill Bill, one of my favourite movies, that might be due to the fact Quentin Tarantino was a director. Overall Sin City is a fantastic comic book movie and is up there with the dark knight as far as best comic book movies go. I loved this movie so much and I really can't wait for the sequel coming out later this year. A.",
