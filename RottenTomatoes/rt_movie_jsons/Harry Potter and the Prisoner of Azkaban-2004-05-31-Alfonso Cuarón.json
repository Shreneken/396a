I have to say it felt like a off kilter rehash of the first 2 films structure for the first 30 minutes or so and as the plot unfolded I was sucked in slowly. The cinematography and special effects are very well done with a lot of variety that seems a bit lacking consistency but as the plot progresses it becomes clearer why its needed to tell such a sharp and original story. The only 2 things that are slightly lacking is the music is solid but not as memorable as the first two and while the acting in this is the strongest of the three so far it still has the 3 main characters not being up to snuff with the supporting cast though it is there best performances by far. Those are so minor because of how strong this plot and direction is it does not matter at all in the grand scheme. It is worth seeing the first 2 films just to see this one.",

This entry is another drastic step up from the previous film and the tone takes a dramatic shift in terms of seriousness.\n\nThe quality and cinematography are simply brilliant in this film. There are so many amazing shots and sequences that just had me completely enamored. These films are ahead of their time for sure.\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has the best plot of the series so far. There is a constant threat looming in the background throughout the entire film that is known from the opening minutes. Sirius Black's menacing posters and headlines create a real sense of danger, and he truly seems mad. The dementors also deliver a serious threat on screen. Their introduction is terrifying, and their presence is felt in every scene.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this film is the conclusion, the time traveling elements are perfect and answer so many questions that I had when running through the finale the first time. My fianc\u00e9 and I were very confused at how things were happening, and I was having a hard time believing it. But it was brilliant the way it looped around, and the audience was given more background information that made those scenes complete.\n\nThe trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint elevate their performances once again. Their chemistry is amazing, and I have a feeling this complement will be handed out during every film until the conclusion. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Sirius Black and one of the more compelling \"villains\" of the series so far. Michael Gambon does an excellent job filling in for the late Richard Harris, it was really difficult to even tell that it was a different actor.\n\nMy only complaint about this film was the beginning of the movie was slightly rushed. I felt like from when Harry left the Dursley's to when he arrived at Hogwarts the audience was whipped around from location to location, and it was hard to keep track of why. But the plot settles in and finds it's groove after that and delivers a near perfect conclusion.\n\nScore: 87%\nVerdict: Excellent",

Wearing muggle clothes more often, darker themes and straying away slightly (but not too much) from the books helped elevate this film to new heights. \n\nI truly believe that if Prisoner of Azkaban would have flopped, the series would not have been finished.

The world feels more lived in and while it keeps its atmosphere in terms of the magical elements the tone has grown more serious. I also think the cast is improved this time around - David Thewlis and Gary Oldman are nice additions. It's also nice to see Harry maturing as a character he is becoming more distinct and less so an audience stand-in.",

            "content": "NO SPOILER REVIEW:\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban:\n\nThe Prisoner of Azkaban is the best Harry Potter film, here's why: \nNot only have I watched this film like 20 times, but every time I re-watch it, I find something new that I hadn't realised before, like the OBVIOUS foreshadowing, and we have the director to thank.\nAlfonso Cuar\u00f3n (Roma, Gravity) is the director, this was his first and only Harry Potter film he has directed and he did a brilliant job directing this film, Prisoner of Azkaban is relatively darker to the previous films, even the weather alone makes the film just look drearier and less colourful than the \"usual\" Harry Potter look.\nThe lighting in the film is also brilliant, the use of light in certain scenes is almost genius. The lighting in the normal muggle world vs the magical world is different showing a clear difference and showing how bland and boring the ordinary muggle world is compared to Hogwarts.\nAs well as this, the cinematography takes a bit of a turn as well, the cinematography is much more diverse than the previous (and future) films overall. I believe this to be the most \"unique\" Harry Potter film out of the 8. They use many techniques like tracking shots, low angle shots, long shots, medium shots, etc. Which up to this point, we had never really seen a lot of experimentation with the different camera shots and techniques used, so in a way this film is a fresh start for Harry Potter. \nThe cast is absolutely perfect as well, we have such brilliant actors and actresses like Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, Maggie Smith, David Thewis, Emma Thompson, Michael Gambon, all some of the finest and best British actors/actresses ever. The actors/actresses all fit their roles perfectly and I think that they followed the book pretty closely, Meeting Sirius Black for the first time will never not be an amazing scene in cinema, in which, Gary Oldman really does brilliantly in this film, he fits the character perfectly and his talent really shines. \n\nHowever, it's not all great. For example, at certain points in the film you can tell what's going to happen before anything actually happens, which I feel is a shame, but except for that the film is a flawless piece of film that I will forever cherish and love. This film was the most unique, best acted film in the whole series. I would highly recommend that you watch this movie, even if you don't like Harry Potter. Just make sure to watch the previous 2 films first so you're all caught up. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nP.S. This was my first review and I hope that it didn't suck. Thank you for reading.",

Los efectos especiales para esta pel\u00edcula est\u00e1n mas pulidos y en varios momentos puedes notar esa ambici\u00f3n del estudio por hacerlo diferente. Aunque tanto la historia como los personajes siguen siendo simples y con un desarrollo predecible, la historia es disfrutable y te regala clips muy buenos, con giros de trama impredecibles que te hacen interesarte por la trama de la misma, para mi la pel\u00edcula se eleva en el 3 acto. Ya que se llega de manera muy natural a esa tan ansiada escena clim\u00e1tica (La escena de Harry vs los Dementores) una escena simplemente espectacular, con muchos matices y mostrando el que para mi es el mensaje de la pel\u00edcula, La esperanza opaca el juicio de quien la posee, con un Harry esperanzado con la idea de tener una familia y de ver a su padre, siendo oscurecido por sus propias ambiciones, un mensaje mas profundo y para mi mas satisfactorio. Estamos viendo la evoluci\u00f3n de los personajes, personajes que poco a poco dejan de tener obst\u00e1culos menores, para centrarse en verdaderos desaf\u00edos, tanto personales como en la trama.

They also became goofier and funnier. The CGI was decent for the most part, but some were noticeably bad. \n\nThe biggest change from the first two was the story, which became more complexed and involved playing with time. This came with a problem for me: in the first hour and a half, I felt like the story was going nowhere, and the pieces were random. However, the ending act tied everything together and explained what happened a lot, perhaps more than it needed to, but probably for the young audiences to follow. \n\nEven though it's 20 minutes shorter than the second one, the runtime still felt very long, mostly because of the set up that seemed to go nowhere at first. It would be better if the story moved faster and connected the pieces sooner. \n\nOverall, I'm still amazed at how well and creative the script and source material used its universe to entertain audience.

That was what I had in mind when I began watching this - Will it also show filthy, cringy characters? Is there going to be terrible CGI with literally no beautiful locations? Are there going to be tons of disgusting scenes? Turns out this movie is better in terms of all those things. And definitely worth a watch if you haven't done it already (I know you muts have, I am the only 90's-born stooge who still hasn't watched this series).\n\nThe story this time takes a much dark, complicated turn. In the beginning of the movie itself Harry kills his aunt, or so it seems since it has been left ambiguously. He doesn't even hesitate from using his magical powers to scare his family anymore, although it is never explained how his uncle knows that he's not allowed to use his powers. This time, just like every other time he is to escape from home and go to Hogwarts station. But this time he does it in a bus being driven by a ghost. I like how every time Harry has to escape from home it always happens in a funny and wholesome manner. Those are the scenes that I could watch forever without getting tired.\n\nAs the series is progressing, Harry Potter is having a higher budget, which is clearly visible by the fact that now it is following the \"show, don't tell\" principle of storytelling way more often. And that's why the story is using a lot less runtime giving exposition or conversations but rather on actually doing things. I learnt this the hard way. I was doing my project on my computer while watching the movie on the phone, and I missed a lot of scenes and had to rewind to see them again. This is a habit that I had developed from the last two movies of the franchise. And I'm really happy to see that supposedly the Potterheads must have really enjoyed seeing it in the theatres or wherever they saw it. They wouldn't have wasted any time on the talkikng scenes like sci-fi movies normally do.\n\nHowever, I am more used to having Harry Potter having a simple story, just like the movies of that time like Narnia and Lord of the Rings. I was doing a project while watching the movie on my phone, so I stopped seeing the movie for like, 5 minutes and by then everything had changed. I never understood when Harry and Hermione went to the past and what exactly were they trying to change. I also didn't know who that guy was who sat on the flying creature and flew away. Also what finally happened of the Dementor, I completely missed out on that part.\n\nThere is something about the Harry Potter movies that stops me from wanting to watch them, and I have no idea why. I also get this feeling with Stuart Little and Narnia. So I can't say for a guarantee that I will rewatch it to watch the scenes that I skipped. Although this movie is a major improvement over Chamber of Secrets, it doesn't match the standard that Sorcerer's Stone has set. I have heard enough about Harry Potter and how much it means to everyone, but personally for me it's not a franchsie I could possibly bond with for some reason. I hope I change my mind soon after future movies.",

What I can't understand is how this is still seen as the best of the entire series after both the 4th and 6th movies were leaps and bounds better than this one was. I get the appeal of an \"auteur\" filmmaker being given a gigantic budget and seeing what he can do with it, but he's hampered here by having to adapt the least-best novel of the series and the creative choices he makes end up not overcoming that and in some cases make the issue worse. Far more than either of the first two movies there's an overwhelming lack of allowing scenes to breathe and a marked increase in intentional confusion. He excises important plot points from the book that would've made the movie make more sense but uses the running time this affords him to focus on trivial things like lingering wide-angle shots of the castle & grounds, all while still condensing the movie to a shorter runtime than those with much simpler plots had been given. The beginning of the plot climax that readers would recognize happens all of a sudden and it's an absolute sprint to get to the finish from there, with only a scant few minutes spent on the confrontation with Sirius and no time even alotted for Cuaron's style to shine through as it's just nonstop book-plot crammed into the final ~35 minutes of running time. This is, to me, the least-best movie in the series as it has nearly all the same faults as the first two without any sense of wonder or amazement. It's especially inferior to later installments with superior plots, acting and special effects. Anyway, I still loved watching it as it's impossible to make a bad Harry Potter movie.",

The visual effects and performances of the main three cast members are both noticeably improved. The recast of Dumbledore works well enough, although newcomer Michael Gambon makes the performance his own with a higher energy version of the character- rather than doing a Richard Harris impression. Throughout this movie there is lots of suspense and intrigue. When things pick up in the final act it delivers one twist after the next- the adult cast adds gravitas to the final confrontation that was lacking in the young Harry Potter focused climax of the first two. The werewolf, dementor attack, and time travel sequences flow seamlessly and have a sense of excitement and urgency. Time travel is used in particularly clever ways, and it's always a blast to see the climax play out twice from different points of view.",

(Harry, Ron and Hermione) -Radcliff, Grint and Watson do my favorite incarnations of the trio in all of the eight adapted films. They perfectly captured what I had in my mind while reading the book. The cinematography and music was masterful. John Williams gave his greatest orchestral piece in all of this great potter universe of incredible music. The production design by Stuart Craig is masterful and reaches new heights in elegance, naturalism, beauty and whimsical glory.

This made, for me, the film much more enjoyable than the first and second.\n\nAs one would no doubt assume, Gary Oldman's portrayal of the character Sirius Black is nothing less than perfect. However, Sirius Black seams an unlikely roll for the talented Oldman. I enjoyed him more in other films, such as 'The Professional' and 'Immortal Beloved'. Let us hope he has had the chance to 'play it up' a bit more in the much anticipated 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'.\n\nThe original music of John Williams is more than I could ever hope to hear. It is absolutely splendid, making the film worth a listen even if you do not watch. Williams has created memorable compositions such as the theme music to 'Star Wars', 'Jaws' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.\n\nOverall, any age should enjoy this film. The visual effects are not the most spectacular I've seen, but fantastic enough to take your imagination away from the real world for 141 minutes. Even the closing credits are kind of cool.\n\nNow, go watch the film. You'll be glad you did.",

There's many little easter eggs that are just pure genius. Kinda seems like a Rian Johnson movie. Cinematically, this movie is amazing. The acting is a crap-ton better than the first two, as well. It's much darker. It actually takes out a time-travel inconsistency from the book that always bugged me, and I thought that was great. Again, like the first two, it leaves out an annoying amount of information that was in the first one. But again, unlike the first two, it actually picks up on the story fast enough. The first two was just one thing after another and at the very end of the movie the plot actually starts. It felt disjointed. In this one, it actually has a plot for most of the movie. Even a bunch of well-executed subplots. And the plot twist at the end\u2026 it completely captured the essence of the surprise that the book had (even if part of the plot twist in the book had partially had to be fulfilled by information from earlier that the book skimped over). I stand by what I'm about to say- the plot twist in the book and less so the movie, is the greatest plot twist of all time. Better than \"Luke, I am your father.\" Yup. I said it. Now, I wasn't able to experience that twist, because I watching the original trilogy when I was like\u2026 two, and then watched the prequel trilogy, and LOVED IT. I remembered absolutely nothing from the original trilogy, but still said I was a die-hard Star Wars fan. So people were able to comfortably talk about \"I am your father\" in front of me, presuming that I already knew about it. I casually took it and slightly remembered it, but for the most part I just never experienced it. THE POINT IS (I bet you forgot I had a point) that I am able to say that the plot twist there is the greatest plot twist of all time, in my opinion. Anyway, back to the movie. The movie is very dark. Chamber and Sorcerer's Stone are pretty childish, and colorful both literally and (in figurative terms) atmospherically. Cinematography-wise, they're very saturated. Alfonso was asked, \"Hey, how bright do you want this movie to be?\" and he responded \"No.\" I love the climax of this movie. It's so dramatic. And honestly, in the books after everyone does all the Scooby-Doo crap (that came off as insulting but honestly I love it, and it's nice to have a little mystery and puzzle-solving in the franchise) the time-travel stuff feels a little rushed. But in this it subverts your expectations (there's a little more Rian Johnson for you) and just when you think you've reached the climax of the movie, BAM, thirty-seven more minutes of time-travel thrown in your face. It's great!\n\nThis movie doesn't have any flaws. So it'd be five stars, right?",

            "content": "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, directed by Alfonso Cuaron, created the best film as of yet, and arguably the best film of the saga! Cuaron crafted some absolutely gorgeous shots, with beautiful cinematography, popping off the screen with a great color pallet. He brings a lot of style to this film, incorporating many long takes, emotional close ups, with seamless editing, that helped the film stand on it's own. Instead of keeping the film more lighthearted, Cuaron brings this darker tone, that elevates the saga to new heights! Chris Columbus seemed to have a tough time focusing on the premise, and fleshing it out, but Cuaron did a fantastic job keeping the narrative tight and cohesive, while still keeping the continuity of the saga. Cuaron utilized amazing imagery, to create a lot of suspense, and twists throughout the narrative, allowing for countless memorable moments! I really don't have many issues with the story or direction; the only nitpicks I have, is that they incorporated a few filler scenes and exposition dumps, but they made things as interesting and entertaining as possible.\n\nEven though, this is very much a story-driven film, Cuaron did not hold back on the amount of genuine character moments between everyone! Cuaron and Kloves did a very good job of balancing all of the characters, trying to give them all more development. Our three leads in, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, all put on great performances, continuously working on their genuine chemistry. The new characters in Gary Oldman, David Thewill, Timothy Spall, and Michael Gambon were all great additions to the story, all putting on enthusiastic performances, fitting the scheme perfectly.\n\nThe screenplay by Steve Kloves, was by far the best one yet! The script was written so well, having so much intricate detail. The comedy was interwoven beautifully, not being forced in and ruining the tone. You can tell that Kloves knows his Harry Potter, and continues on making great screenplays.\n\nThe Prisoner of Azkaban took full advantage of fleshing out their world, and their magic! Cuaron digs deeper on the magic, giving us so many entertaining sequences! Cuaron and the art directors crafted so many brilliantly looking sets, looking completely authentic, with amazing detail, making you feel like you were actually at Hogwarts.\n\nOverall, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has so much to offer, with a brilliantly shot film, amazing characters, and beautiful looking set pieces!",

            "content": "Well, three movies in and it's still going strong, I never really appreciated this third film when I was younger, I would just watch the first two on a loop over and over again back in the day, but rewatching this again in 2020 has really opened my eyes to the great craft on display here. Alfonso Cuaron is such a gifted filmmaker, he knew exactly how to handle the story this time around by only including the main plots and sub-plots that directly affect Harry which gave him time to graft in some really good character-building moments, this is the shortest film so far and it is a breath of fresh air to not be too faithful to the source material, he really tweaked it around a bit to make it a more cohesive and structured narrative. Columbus' first two films have a distinct style and a tone of child-like awe and wonder, but this film shows you that not all magic is good and it is even darker than the last film. The acting all around is very good including newcomers David Thewlis and Gary Oldman who were both likable characters, especially Thewlis who is given a lot of time to develop a relationship with Harry and we see how much he genuinely wants to help him. The cinematography is gorgeous, it brings Hogwarts to life with a great dark and dreary color palette, you feel the dementors sucking your joy away just from the colors and the way it is shot. The CGI is massively improved from the last two films and it is used only when necessary which maximizes the effectiveness of it. Emma Thompson plays another new character and she is strange, but she works her way into the plot nicely and I like her as an actress. Buckbeak the Hippogriff is awesome, it gives you a sense of grandeur and hope in this otherwise bleak feeling film, seeing Hagrid teaching is great and his love for animals is so heartwarming, I liked seeing his characters have more to do this time around. The Dursleys are back in the beginning with an entertaining sequence of a lady inflating like a balloon, Richard Harris is still the most underrated actor in the series. This movie has the least to do with the overarching theme of Voldemort in the entire series, this kind of feels like a spinoff in that sense and it makes a great small scale feel and I like those types of movies. Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore really works for me, he is not old and fragile anymore, he actually moves around the castle and is livelier. The time travel can get confusing, but it all works and creates a great feeling of unpredictability. The Quidditch match was short and not a lot happened which disappointed me a bit. The only issues I have with this film is that it leans a little too heavy on comedy and it doesn't always work, I liked the comedic undertones and it mostly worked, just a couple jokes fell flat for me; the other issue is that I never liked how Werewolf Lupin looked, it is just weird, it needed more hair, a darker skin color, and look less human-like, but it is still scary nonetheless. This is the best-directed film in the series, the CGI is greatly improved, it goes darker and it works, there are actually a few good jokes, the story is very precise and cohesive but still allows for character growth, the acting is really good all around, the script is excellent, and the cinematography is amazing. I really understand why this is such a beloved film in the series now and I would agree that it is the best so far.",

            "content": "A mind bending caper to refresh the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nAlfonso Cuar\u00f3n's dark fantasy adventure feature Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) is a bolt of artistic energy that ensured the Harry Potter series would remain unique each film with a bold new Gothic aesthetic. Cuar\u00f3n's direction is flawless as he executes a complex time travel concept for the third Harry Potter picture. His arthouse sensibilities make for a creative display of directorial prowess with a clear vision for how things should proceed. Steven Weisberg's editing is nifty as he cuts together various takes and sequences together to keep time travelling linearly for the audience to make sense of a strange and intricate plot.\n\nMichael Seresin's cinematography is striking with unique angles, long panning shots, and shifting perspectives. His wide shots outdoors are so breathtaking and more natural than previous installments of Harry Potter. You get a real feel for Hogwarts' surroundings. The production design is darker and dingier than before too to keep things gritty. Elizabeth Lewis' make-up is very natural, letting actors look normal. Likewise, Jany Temime and Davis Crossman's costumes opt for modern fashions and contemporary clothes to keep Harry and his friends relatable to teens of the time. It's a bold, risky choice that pays off.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe is fantastic as an eager Harry Potter, full of anxiety and dread. Rupert Grint is funny as always as the bumbling and steadfast Ron Weasley. Gary Oldman is frantic and endearing as Sirius Black, while David Thewlis is likable and kind as Harry's new professor against the dark arts and mentor Remus Lupin. Alan Rickman is still entertaining and likable as Severus Snape with his unforgiving glares and quiet menace. His eagerness for vengeance is particularly interesting here as a setup for future Harry Potter films. Tom Felton does more with less as the cruel bully Draco Malfoy. Timothy Spall makes an unforgettable cameo as Peter Pettigrew. James and Oliver Phelps come into their own as brilliant comedy relief as Fred and George Weasley.\n\nJ. K. Rowling's novel and Steve Kloves' script is clever as Harry Potter and his friends grow up into teenagers dealing with unsure feelings and strong moral convictions. Harry Potter must deal with fear and rage, while learning forgiveness alongside new defensive spells. Hermione saves the day with a brilliant leading performance from Emma Watson as the confident genius witch Hermione Granger. Rowling's writing matured with her audience. Great writing is what captured kids' imagination watching Harry Potter for a decade and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a prime example.\n\nBonnie Wright is still adorable as Ginny Weasley, although my only gripe is that she doesn't get enough screen time in Prisoner of Azkaban.\n\nMichael Gambon takes up the challenge to replace the late Richard Harris, rest in peace, who kindly Albus Dumbledore endeared his wizard character to an entire generation. Gambon excels as a knowledgeable and helpful wizard in his own way, without trying to do an impression of Harris. I'll always prefer Harris' nice and friendly Dumbledore, but Gambon seems powerful and cooler. Robbie Coltrane is still lovable as Rubeus Hagrid. Maggie Smith is still excellent as Minerva McGonagall, while Emma Thompson is wonderful as the strange seer Sybill Trelawney.\n\nJohn Williams' score is darker and more subdued than his bright and whimsical compositions for the first two Harry Potter movies. Chris Columbus' childlike sense of wonder is gone and replaced with Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's stark realism and dark tendencies, so Williams' music adjusted accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a smart, fast, dark, and cool fantasy movie for all teenagers.",

Rowling's novel of the same name and which is the third instalment in the Harry Potter film series.\nThis movie is where the franchise starts to get darker while its core audience gets more mature. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n brings a dark tale which feels like a Soviet revenge story and it's so good!\nThe story follows Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year at Hogwarts as he is informed that a prisoner named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban and intends to kill him.\nI feel like Daniel Radcliffe is the weakest actor in this movie. That's unfortunate because all of these focus around him, and this is one of the most important movies in the series. When he was in a scene leaning his Patronus with Professor Lupin, he was good, and I was invested. But when he learns a secret about Sirius Black and gets angry, he doesn't do a good job at showing emotion. It took me out a bit. However, everybody else brings their A-Game. Gary Oldman being brought into the series is fantastic, and this is the first time we see Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Michael Gambon is fine, but I did find myself missing Richard Harris as the soft spoken and wise Professor.\nThis is the \u2018Harry Potter' film that stands on its own and as a tremendous cinematic achievement. It challenges viewers and yet doesn't patronize them or attempt to offer answers to all of the questions presented. The plot contains the requisite amounts of twists and turns. And above all else it is beautifully shot and edited.\nOverall, in my opinion this is the best in the series. It has so much story to tell and adds important characters to the main story of the series.\n4.5/5",

Visually and dramatically, they've grown into their roles, and director Alphonso Cuar\u00f3n lets them flaunt that newfound independence in his only take on the series. The school feels more lived-in and tangible, as opposed to the amusement park it seemed in the first two movies, and its residents (particularly the three central Hogwarts kids) are less buttoned-up and disciplined, more comfortable with their surroundings. It's also darker and more foreboding, foreshadowing the idea that this series was headed into stormy waters.\n\nAdding Gary Oldman to the mix seems a good choice, though he does little more than snarl and growl menacingly, Michael Gambon plays a more vibrant Dumbledore in relief of the late Richard Harris, and the returning cast all do well in their established roles. The plot flitters around for quite a while, however, obsessing over excessive amounts of day-in-the-life snapshots and unrelated asides. That does confirm the sense of wonder that's been imbued in this world since day one, but it also makes the plot feel extra slow and padded-out.\n\nThe effects work has improved since The Chamber of Secrets, even if it still shows some cobwebs (particularly during the whomping willow ride). That progress could be attributed to a strict limit on house elves and quidditch matches, which were both prime suspects in the more eye-rolling segments of the preceding film. Prisoner is fair enough, with a meatier plot and a more tangible landscape. And, huzzah, the greater narrative does finally begin to move somewhere interesting. Alas, I still can't quite figure what all the fuss is about with this series. Maybe one had to grow up reading the novels.",

            "content": "Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's masterful adaptation does the source material immeasurable justice by exploring its underlying concepts in an intelligent manner. Of course, it certainly helps that the aesthetics of the film are incredible, the acting remains stellar (and the trio of young actors handle their roles admirably), and John Williams offers an amazing (and eclectic) score. Character development is superb - Steve Kloves penned a great script.\n\nFirst-time and young viewers will likely enjoy the film for its merits based on plot and 'adventure' alone, but it takes multiple viewings and a critical eye to enjoy the abstract ideas and nuances. Cuar\u00f3n himself credited the source material as being laden with real-world issues: oppression, racism, loneliness, power, friendship, justice and so forth.\n\nThis is the Harry Potter film that stands on its own and as a tremendous cinematic achievement. It challenges viewers and yet doesn't patronize them or attempt to offer answers to all of the questions presented. For instance, the ending is bittersweet at best and retains a healthy amount of ambiguity.\n\nIf you've never read the books or understood the acclaim of the series as a whole, watch Cuar\u00f3n's 'Prisoner of Azkaban' and you'll understand why this entry is clearly the zenith of the seven.f there's anything this movie proves, it is the difficulty in separating the series from the demands of fans. This is clear just from hearing some of the comments. \"Why didn't they identify the names on the Marauder's Map?\" \"Why wasn't the second Quidditch game shown?\" \"Why wasn't there more of Crookshanks the Cat?\" By focusing on what the film didn't have, fans fail to look at the film on its own terms. I think this is by far the best Harry Potter movie yet.\n\nThe only way to satisfy fans would be to include everything from the book, which would require a miniseries. Since that isn't what these films are, the story has to be abridged. The first two films tried to fit everything they could within a reasonable slot of time. The result was a set of films that felt cluttered yet incomplete. Had they continued with this strategy for this movie, based on a much longer book, it would surely have been over three hours long.\n\nThe virtue of the latest film is that it makes a real attempt to adapt the story, not just marching in lockstep with the book's events. The screenplay is sparing, leaving out or simplifying loads of details not directly relevant to the plot. But it captures much of the book's delight and humor. The first two films fell short in this regard, because they lacked the guts to tinker with the details, even though that was the key to condensing the story while staying true to its spirit.\n\nThe movie is still faithful to the book, of course. Many of the scenes are exactly as I had imagined them. When it deviates, it does so based on an understanding of the story and characters. This is evident in the way they show, for example, the Knight Bus; Hermione's overstuffed schedule; and the introduction of the Marauder's Map, a scene that captures the twins' mischievous personalities. The changes are clever and funny, and they help compensate for the movie's loss in other areas.\n\nCertainly this has something to do with the new director. Columbus's approach was to stick to the books as literally as possible, often draining them of their subtlety. For instance, where the books only hint that Dumbledore can see through the invisibility cloak, the earlier movies make it unmistakable. The new director never condescends to the audience in that way. This is a children's movie, but it is also a fantasy-thriller that we can take seriously, because not everything is spelled out for us. We're given a chance to think.\n\nBut part of what makes the movie work is the book itself. The story is gripping from start to finish, because the threat looming over the school is established early on. Harry's personal life is sharply intertwined with the plot. We feel for him as we watch his disastrous (but hilarious) attempts to escape his uncle and aunt, and his humiliating reaction to the dementors. The story avoids common devices such as the talking killer or deus ex machina, which the other books have in abundance. The ending is nicely bittersweet and ambiguous. The plot is so complicated, however, that the book spends several chapters explaining it all. The movie wisely includes only very little of this, allowing the plot twists to become understood as the story progresses. I was surprised to see certain events that were in the movie but not the book lend support to an important theory some fans have had about what is to be revealed at the end of the series. Of course, it is well-hidden and won't give anything away for those who aren't looking for the clues.\n\nI was so satisfied with the film that it almost seems trivial to mention the flaws, but there are some. The portrayal of Fudge's assistant as the standard hunchbacked dimwit is out of place here, as it would be in anything other than a cartoon or spoof. The most serious misstep, though, is the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Gambon's face seems frozen in a perpetual nonexpression, and his voice lacks resonance. He compares poorly to the late Richard Harris, whose line readings had gravity, and who played the character with a twinkle in his eyes. It is a pure mystery to me why this actor was chosen as a replacement, especially considering the fine performances from other members of the cast. Even the children are in top form here.\n\nThose complaints aside, this is the movie I was hoping they would make when the series began. If it doesn't live up to the book, so what? What's important is that it lives up to its potential as a movie. Fans who want a carbon-copy of the book are looking in the wrong place, because they're never going to get it here. This is probably the best example of a Harry Potter movie that we're ever likely to see.Director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n has taken the images conjured by J.K. Rowling's magical words and created from her book, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,' a film rife with visual symbolism and alive with inventive images beyond those established by the first two films in the series. Cuar\u00f3n, a native of Mexico City and the acclaimed director of the completely compelling, frequently hilarious and sexually explicit coming-of-age film, 'Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n,' was seen by many as an odd choice to follow heartland American Chris Columbus into the Harry Potter director's chair. The selection has resulted in a film darker and more mature than its predecessors, just as was the book, but it is also as approachable for young people as Cuar\u00f3n's other internationally heralded work, 'A Little Princess.'\n\nIt is late in the summer. Harry (a decidedly more assertive Daniel Radcliffe, making his third appearance in the leading role) is at the Dursleys in Privet Drive, preparing for his third year at Hogwart's, when an obnoxious relative demeans his father's memory, causing Harry to lose his temper. As a result, Harry violates the rules of student witches and wizards, causing the offending aunt to inflate as a dirigible and float away into the night sky on an stream of invectives. It is a delightful opening to a film with far more serious issues to explore and frightening obstacles to overcome. Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), imprisoned at Azkaban for complicity in the murder of Harry's parents, has escaped, and is looking for Harry. The soul-stealing prison guards called 'Dementors' (Latin for mind-removers) are searching for Black everywhere, but when he and Harry meet, there are revelations which change everything.\n\nThe symbolism in the film is fascinating. Rowling is responsible for a lot of it, but Cuar\u00f3n has used symbolism as a visual tool to alert the audience to impending danger and to keep tensions high. Traditionally, black-feathered birds such as ravens, crows, and vultures all have negative images associated with them; they are usually used to represent carnage, bloodshed and battle; they are thought of in terms of scavengers, messengers of the dead, and evil. Crows abound in this film, but Cuar\u00f3n has extended their traditional roles, turning them into symbols of the Dementors, which fly around menacingly in black garments with feather-like hems. Even when the Dementors are out of sight (they are not allowed on the grounds of Hogwart's School) you can feel their presence in the crows.\n\nRowling's most obvious use of symbolism is in the name she gives the escaped prisoner Sirius Black. Sirius is a star in the constellation Canis Majoris (in mythology, Canis Majoris is one of Orion's hunting dogs; the Greater Dog), the brightest star in the sky. So, Sirius is also called the Dog Star, and everyone knows that the dog is distinguished above all other inferior animals for intelligence, docility, and attachment to man. Would she give such a name, with all its implications, to a villainous character? Not likely. But she would give it to a wizard who could change into a dog.\n\nAmong the new visual images are animal ghosts which wander the halls of Hogwart's Castle and the film's realization of Buckbeak the Hippogriff, like Sirius, falsely accused and condemned. Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and all of the established characters return. Led by Harry, all the students have matured considerably, as you would expect of 13-year-olds; they are more independent and self assured, more emotionally developed and far less childlike in their reactions and bearing. Michael Gambon is new and effective as Aldus Dumbledore, following the death of Richard Harris. Emma Thompson is wonderfully wacky as Divination Professor Sybil Treelawney; who leaps from the pages of the book and onto the screen as if Rowling had written the character specifically for Thompson. Also new is Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor Remus Lupin (David Thewles), who comes to Harry's aid in ways that might befit his Latin name. Remus was the brother of the founder of Rome. In mythology, he was nursed by a she-wolf; Lupin means wolf-like (wolf is Canis Lupis).\n\nThe unheralded thread of creative continuity in this marvelous series, as it moves from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n to incoming director Mike Newell (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, now in production) is Screenwriter Steve Kloves. He and the producers have been true to Rowling's works and to Harry's fans, in ways that have always enhanced, not diminished, the author's incredible achievement.",

            "content": "A deeper and more creepy installment, with a lot more layered story and fun moments. \n\nPrisoner of Azkaban also marks the introduction of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who has escaped from the title prison after 12 years of incarceration. Believed to have been the right-hand-man of the dark wizard Voldemort, whom Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) mysteriously rendered powerless during his infancy, some of those closest to Harry suspect Black has returned to exact revenge on the boy who defeated his master. \n\nThere's a lot of things to love about the third installment in the franchise, even if it still has a couple of problems. However, it improves upon the mistakes it had made in previous films, while also adding new aspects for us to enjoy. This film is filled with more magic than we have ever seen, while still finding more reasons to love the characters that we've already been introduced to.\n\nThe film starts out with its classic introduction. Harry is having a miserable time at his house with his obviously abusive parents. After conflict, he leaves and makes his way to Hogwarts. There, another threat lurks that puts his life in jeopardy. Along with that, a new Dark Arts teacher (oddly suspicious) arrives and Harry and his friends go on their adventures. It follows the similar format of previous films, but it does a good job of taking a few twists and turns here and there. \n\nI do like this film more than the first two for multiple reasons, ones that aren't neccesarily a negative on the first two films. We do get to see even more progression from our third year characters. Harry is growing up and wants to learn more about his family, Ron and Hermione grow a tad closer as the film's been foreshadowing their relationship since movie number one, and the wizarding world gets more rumors of the return of Voldemort. We get to learn a little more about our characters and see how their skills have developed over the past few years. It gives us an even more nice and interesting ark. \n\nThis film in particular took and interesting and even more exceptional route to its storytelling. I like the way this story was told compared to the first two films. It had some elements that I didn't particularly care for, but I won't speak of as they would be spoilers (basically the finale). However, it strayed from the format that the first two films embraced, but it worked out pretty decently. I thought the screenplay was really well written and I still had a lot of fun with this film. You can see the transition toward a darker story and I can't wait to see more. \n\nIn the end, objectively, this film surpasses the first two films. Subjectively, I honestly had just as much fun with this film as I did with the first two films. That is why even thought it was an exceptionally made film, I'm still going to give it the solid rating I gave the first two films.",

The narrative of a mass murderer on the loose trying to hunt down Harry is very intriguing. Voldemort has always been lurking in the shadows, but the threat never felt as real as it does in this one. The casting of Gary Oldman as Serious Black is an inspired choice. He is a perfect fit for the role. His chemistry with all the characters that he interacts with is just amazing. His wild but determined character is one to be remembered. I loved this film. The only weakness I could find was the look of Professor Lupin in his werewolf form. It just reminded me of a mangey dog. Other than that the film is just a film fans delight. It is worthy of many repeat viewings. Alphons Cuaron tweaks the tone from the first two films just enough to give Harry Potter fans the edge they have been itching for. Big round of applause to this amazing entry into an ever growing franchise.",

But overall it didn't really feel that immersive as I frequently fidgeted with my DVD remote so I won't get bored. Second, everything feels like a blur and the scene in the book with the cage holding the Monster Book of monsters is a wasted opportunity to sneak in some humor. With a new director, everything feels different compared to the first two movies and not in a good way. The always cloudy sky looks drab, I get it that Alfonso Cuaron maybe wanted the movie to have a dark look and feel but ultimately feels, meh. But there are good things about the movie, like how it keeps things fresh by not having Harry defeat Voldemort again and again and introducing Harrys Godfather Sirius black and the casting of David Thewlis as Lupin. To tell what I just said in the review. A good movie, but if you expect it to deliver Harry Potter justice, prepare to be disappointed.",

Gary Oldman joins the cast as Sirius Black and gives a welcome, manic performance. You really get a sense of the young Harry and his friends growing up in this film and all the leads rise to the challenge well. The complex plot is kept punchy and well-paced and the twists are neatly tied up without too much exposition from the cast.

Yes this is definitely the most stylish Harry Potter to date, but it also features some great characterisation for our leads (who's cast continue to excel in their roles), and a further exploration of the franchise themes.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: This time the plot itself is actually weaker than in the previous film, and whilst it takes itself on fewer annoying tangents, it fails to draw a suspenseful narrative overall. I found the whole story rather stagnant actually, and even if the source material is partly to blame for that, the filmmakers should realise that straight adaptation isn't always the best way.\nVERDICT: The execution is vastly improved here.

Malfoy continues to be an utterly pointless irritation, and his comeuppances simply don't justify his presence.

            "content": "As the trio gets older the films become a little darker and more mature.  Watching the Harry Potter series within days of each other can be a tough adjustment.  Especially considering how family friendly the first two installments are, but no matter the subtitle, Harry Potter films always maintain that fun atmosphere.\n\nHarry and his buddies have turned 13, his first year of his teens, and this film subtly tackles some common issues that an early teen has.  Not only is Harry dealing with the angst of trying to be independent from his muggle family, but he then is forced with coming to terms with an estranged family member returning to find Harry, Sirius Black.  All the films have relatively the same setting, characters, and tone, but Prisoner of Azkaban is clearly a part of a maturation process for Harry.  There's something to be said for a film that takes its franchise in a totally new direction (i.e. Fast Five), but I also can't help but think this film was missing a few familiar plot points.\n\nAlfonso Cuar\u00f3n took the reigns from Chris Columbus and he brought a refreshing take on the Potterverse.  Just by simply looking at the advancement of technology in CGI and in the unique camera movements/shots, this was going to be a different Potter film.  Cuar\u00f3n brought along Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore, after the unfortunate passing of Richard Harris.  As great as Harris is, his calming presence may not have worked as Dumbledore here.  Gambon fits in well as a more demanding and mysterious headmaster than in the previous two films.\n\nWith that said, Voldemort's lack of presence is definitely felt.  I enjoy the late-game twist in the film's villain and I understand we don't necessarily need him every film, but there was barely any mention of him.  Yes, that's the way it is in the book, but for me, it degrades the score a bit.  The focus here is more on Sirius Black and Professor Lupin.  Both of which have unexpected twists and turns that make the third act quite the whirlwind.  To me, this film plays more as a part 1 of 2 to the Goblet of Fire, because we only get a glimpse into Pettigrew and his relation to the dark lord and Harry's parents.  \n\nEither way, Prisoner of Azkaban is a welcomed changeup in the film's franchise and one that, on repeat viewings, only gets better.  I mean, who doesn't love time travel, Hippogriff's, a long awaited punch, a little quality time with Harry & Hermione, and one big twist right?  It's a slower pace and a darker tone, but Prisoner of Azkaban is no slouch of a film.\n\n+ Cuar\u00f3n's different style\n\n+Gary Oldman enters the picture\n\n+Fantastic visuals/cinematography\n\n+Hermione & Harry team-up\n\n-No Voldemort presence\n\n8.7/10",

His scores to Star Wars, ET and Home Alone are better. The only real quibble i had with the movie was Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Richard Harris, the first and better Dumbledore, had died, and although Gambon was good, Harris suited the character a lot more in terms of looks and sincerity. The three leads are still likable, and they are given solid support by Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane. The real treat lies in the newcomers though, namely David Thewlis as Lupin, Emma Thompson as Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius. Timothy Spall I felt was a little odd for Wormtail. The Dementors I felt quite terrifying, a lot more chilling than they were in the book. All in all, very good. 8/10. Bethany Cox",

The scene in the shrieking shack is a perfect example of intense action on a small scale. Yet, the continuity slips up incredibly. While I much prefer Alfonzo directing, he clearly ignored a lot of the things that had already been set up by Columbus, even if he didn't have to. Changing Dumbledore needed to be done; Flitwicks makeover, the redesign of the castle and the sudden new school rules on wardrobe did not. Add to that this was a terrible adaptation, which left me screaming at the scream on my first sitting, you can understand why I don't think it's perfect.

While Hermione's (Emma Watson) cat torments Ron's (Rupert Grint) sickly rat, causing a rift among the trio, a swarm of nasty Dementors is sent to protect the school from Black.

            "content": "The first of the Harry Potter films to actually have a dark undertone, The Prisoner of Azkaban is the third installment in the Harry Potter series. The film is centered on the escape of Sirius Black from Azkaban and how our favorite trio deals with the new threat. The trio of actors are growing up, along with their characters. They can no longer be treated as children, but rather young actors. Of course, as they are young, they aren't perfect, Radcliffe in this film seems a little too nervous and unnatural in many scenes. Emma Watson's most memorable scene is when she punched Draco Malfoy's face. Rupert Grint is very good at playing the helpless and annoying best friend. It is understandable that Grint wouldn't have much to give to the movie as his character is very two dimensional. Radcliffe, on the other hand, does not have that luxury. He definitely feels the pressure of his role, as he has to portray a character so many people love and imagine, but also listen to the directors and advice of the older actors. I feel as though they have improved in their acting from the previous films, though I would definitely say that they still have many areas that they need to work on. They are lucky enough to be able to work with many so many older actors that have many years of experience. These actors would definitely be good teachers to the younger cast.\n The older actors are what really made this film so great. There were more scenes with the older actors and they enhanced this movie. With Richard Harris's death, Michael Gambon stepped in to portray the wise headmaster Albus Dumbledore. He has done a great job portraying Dumbledore not only as a peculiar and mischievous headmaster, but also a man of great wisdom given in riddles. We also get to see a lot more of Snape. Alan Rickman's drawling tone and gloomy atmosphere is remarkably spiteful. David Thewlis plays the role of Remus Lupin, a seemingly harmless and wise teacher with dark secrets. His greatest part in the movie would be helping Harry fight his fears and becoming the first father figure that Harry would encounter and remember in his life.\nWhen something is dark and ominous, the music makes the audience feel uneasy, or when the music whimsical, people can expect some laughs. The main composer of this film is John Williams and I felt that his music improved the movie scenes more so than the past two films. The scene where Harry first flies on the hippogriff is a magnificent piece of music. The beginning starts off with a fierce drum solo and then proceeds with magical string instruments and chimes to create majestic feel. This correlates with the scene as Harry flies around the castle. It makes the castle look spectacular and glorious. Another song that really makes the scene is \"A Window to the Past\". It plays where Harry is talking to Professor Lupin on the bridge. He learns that Lupin was his parents' longtime friend and he learns more about his parents in this scene. This song is initially played by a harp and a flute. It gives off a sentimental feel and it fits with the medieval setting of Hogwarts. \nThe animations of the film are splendid. So much of the film is takes place where supernatural coexists with normalcy, all of which has to be made by CGI. The dementors were beautifully made and served its purpose of giving children nightmares at night. Director Cuaron's wizard world is much more bleak and ominous than Director Columbus's world. Instead of prancing around the castle corridors, much of the movie takes place outside Hogwarts. This movie feels much more dangerous, more enchanted and most importantly, real. The shadowy forests full of magical creatures, the damp meadows, the dark skies, all of this just screams Cuaron. There are a lot more scenes where the viewer is able to take time and fully look at the entirety of Hogwarts. He is a natural at capturing the eerie and mysterious power of the natural world. \nThe first scene that I felt was beautifully made, was the first time the dementors came on board the train. Rupert Grint's acting here was splendid, Emma Watson needed more work on pretending to be in pain. Though she more than made up for it later in the film as a growing lady with snarky comments.  The dementors, the music, the special effects, all were beautifully woven into a scene that would strike fear into many people's hearts.",

With Chris Columbus leaving the director's chair to spend more time with his family, the time was ripe for a fresh pair of eyes to come in and give the franchise the kick up the arse that it badly needed. With The Lord of the Rings trilogy now completed, garnering rave reviews and 11 Oscars, this would be the film that would need to justify going on. While Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban never quite comes close to Peter Jackson's brilliance, it is far superior to anything that came before in the series and set the bar very high for all that came after.\n\nAlfonso Cuar\u00f3n may now be a name toasted among film fans, following his gripping work on Children of Men and the groundbreaking visuals in Gravity. But he was by no means a shoe-in to direct. Guillermo del Toro said that he wasn't interested because it was too \"bright and happy and full of light\", while Marc Forster turned it down because of his work with child actors on Finding Neverland. In the end it came down to a three-way choice between Cuar\u00f3n, Thelma and Louise screenwriter Callie Khouri, and Kenneth Branagh, who had appeared as Gilderoy Lockhart in the previous instalment, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\n\nThe box office failure of Love's Labour's Lost probably deprived us of the heady excitement that would have been a Branagh-helmed Potter film. But there can be no doubt that Cuar\u00f3n was a great choice, for one simple reason: he understands how fantasy storytelling works, particularly how any fantasy film must be underpinned by a sense of wonderment. Columbus' pathological desire to faithfully replicate the books on screen had robbed J. K. Rowling's source material of all its sense of wonder and amazement. Cuar\u00f3n restores the balance, giving us a darrker plot with more developed characters and never losing sight of the magic in amongst the spells.\n\nPut simply, all the details of the world of Harry Potter, and the story in which he finds himself, are more fully and strikingly realised in Prisoner of Azkaban. Cuar\u00f3n gets a lot of the big stuff right early on, whether it's the light-hearted comedy of the Knight Bus or the chilling design of the Dementors. But he also puts in a lot of effort to make all the little details fit, particularly during the scenes at The Leaky Cauldron. Whether it's the self-stirring coffee, the angular corridors, the carnivorous books or the silently screaming wanted posters, you always feel that what you are seeing is magic, rather than constantly being told that something is magic.\n\nThis magical feeling is reinforced by the film's colour palette. In my review of The Philosopher's Stone, I likened its visual style to sanitised adaptations of Charles Dickens which are common in America; as a general rule, I argued, British adaptations of Great Expectations, Oliver Twist and the like are more content to leave all the edges on. This film is shot by Michael Seresin, Alan Parker's cinematographer-of-choice who would later team up with Cuar\u00f3n again on Gravity. Cuar\u00f3n clearly understands the darker, more distinctly British roots of the series and the genres upon which it draws, and allows Seresin to work his murky magic with piercing blues and encircling blacks, making it look like a horror film for children.\n\nFrom a narrative point of view, Prisoner of Azkaban benefits greatly from the direct absence of Voldemort. On the one hand, the fact that he doesn't appear physically or personally in the story spares the film from becoming too repetitive or formulaic: it isn't simply retreading old ground and prolonging the inevitable. This is the trap into which the later Potter films often fell: we always knew that things would end with a showdown between Harry and Voldemort, and the more the films went on without it happening, the more irritating the tease became.\n\nOn the other hand, the Dark Lord's influence remains a background threat, allowing Cuar\u00f3n to build a more intimidating atmosphere. In the first two films, Harry was constantly on the lookout for the man himself: we always knew who the bad guy was, even if we didn't know what form he would take. With Voldemort having to prey on Harry indirectly, he is forced to choose his friends more carefully, and learns over the course of the film just how deceptive appearances can be.\n\nBy putting Harry on more insecure footing, the film manages to epitomise his adolescent confusion about the world, and the conflict he faces in fulfilling a role which he didn't choose. The first two films often painted Harry as a goody-two-shoes who had perfect parents, but here we get the first hints of things being a little more nuanced than that. When Harry watches the Dementors kill him and Sirius, expecting his dad to come in and cast the patronus charm, he begins to realise that he cannot rely on their reputation if he is to grow as a wizard. While the next film in the series goes into this in more detail, threatening to tear apart the three central friendships, Prisoner of Azkaban does a good job of setting this up.\n\nThis brings us on naturally to the time travel element of the story. Anyone familiar with Back to the Future Part II, Twelve Monkeys or Timecrimes will instantly recognise the territory we are in, with the characters constantly trying to avoid running into themselves, and events being repeated from different perspectives. Coming as it does towards the end of the film, our natural instinct is to conclude that it's surplus to requirement, one twist too many. But if we allow it to play out and watch as all the pieces fit together, we discover that it ties into the central themes of trust and reputation quite nicely. Besides, if we can accept the existence of horcruxes, sorting hats and hippogriffs, time travel isn't much of a stretch.\n\nDespite all its darkness and intimidation, Prisoner of Azkaban also manages to be pretty funny. The scene where Potter beats up Malfoy and his thugs near the Shrieking Shack is a classic piece of British slapstick, with Tom Felton showing excellent timing through his many pratfalls. The interplay between Snape and Sirius is like a double-act in itself, with Sirius' manic energy coming up against Snape's stonewalling seriousness. Throw in the first scene with the boggart and most of the opening section, and you have a film which achieves a fine balance of light and shade.\n\nWith the young cast continuing to improve and growing into their roles, Prisoner of Azkaban also has a couple of aces up its sleeve in the adult cast. David Thewlis was an ideal choice for Lupin: he revels in his lanky physicality and whistful delivery, in stark contrast to his more tight-laced performance in Gangster No. 1. Gary Oldman's performance is equally remarkable, being much more operatic in scale but still retaining a gentle, tortured humanity. Oldman resists the urge to simply ham it up and play mad, imbuing Sirius with a tormented quality which makes him compelling.\n\nIn spite of all its successes, there are still a couple of problems with Prisoner of Azkaban. Despite the best efforts of Cuar\u00f3n and screenwriter Steve Kloves, elements of the plot are still repetitive or predictable. After three films, it's fair to presume that whoever holds the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts is going to be a villain in some form, and it is equally certain that Dumbledore will pop up at key moments to misdirect, drop hints or mischievously intervene. These tropes aren't enough to derail the action at any given point, but they are pinches of salt to be taken whenever anyone describes this film as ground-breaking.\n\nAdditionally, the film still feels longer than it should. This was the shortest of the three films at the time, at 142 minutes, and it remained the shortest until Order of the Phoenix three years later. But while the pacing is better than Columbus' offerings, it still feels like there is an awful lot of plot being squeezed in when the sensible thing would be to cut more stuff out. Cuar\u00f3n keeps the fans at arms' length, deciding what he wants to shoot and leave in, but another couple of swift edits to get it down to two hours wouldn't have hurt.\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a massive improvement on the first two films, justifying the continuation of the series and helping to explain its appeal to those out of the loop. While it's still too long and well-worn in places, it largely makes up for this with strong performances, interesting themes, much better pacing and a visual style that combines horror and fantasy to leave us really impressed. Whether it's the best Harry Potter film remains a matter of debate, but there is no debate that the later films owe their existence to its success.",

It felt like this film was a mad dash to hit all the important events and moments from the novel without slowing down to let the audience take in the character development or impact of plot points.  It makes me sad how this story was adapted to film, because it is my favourite of the Harry Potter books (I like to call it the \"Goldfinger\" of Harry Potter, since it is the third installment and has no Voldemort at all, much like how \"Goldfinger is the third Jame Bond film and of the first 7 films, is the only one to have nothing to do with SPECTRE).  I also struggled with the casting of David Thewlis as Lupin, as his appearance and voice is not at all what I imagined when reading the book (that's a me problem, really, and not an issue with the film).  I thought the acting in this film was good; Gary Oldman was spectacular for the 5 minutes he actually got to act.  I was sad that he didn't get a little more development early on in the film, because his crazed portrayal was quite good.  Just another victim of adapting the complex book story to film.  I'm a little thrown by Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore, as it is so drastically different from Richard Harris' portrayal.  It's not bad, just different and takes some adjusting.  Overall, I wish they hadn't clung so tightly to keeping things quite so close to the book and retooled the story to flow and work better as a film.",

It's actually the first movie that when I first saw it, I closed my eyes because I was getting really scared of the movie, and that's because it gets more and more dark so far. The effects are amazing and creative. It develops a bit of chemistry between Ron and Hermione which I'm glad they put it in, even if it's short. The story is great and never seem to be similar to the previous films. he cast is great as usual, but what was actually one of the highlights, is Gary Oldman who is just fantastic in this, even if he was barely in it. David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, and Timothy Spall are also really good in it that made it memorable. I was starting to think that if there's questions that weren't answered in the movie, then you have to read the book to find out, which at first I was thinking that's a bad thing, but consider that it's based on a book, I'll let it slide. It's more exciting and still has lots of funny moments. It has more emotional depth than the previous films, and it's the best Harry Potter film so far.",

Even changing directors (from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuaron) can't stop this juggernaut of excellent films.\n\nOnce again, Steve Kloves' script keeps very close to the book. While the director added in new elements, both good (clock motif) and questionable (overly exaggerated Ron-Hermione shipping), the film still feels very much like the first two, albeit with a darker tone (which the book also creates, so good job on that).\n\nI am now enjoying the child actors more, as they have both literally and figuratively grown into their roles. Daniel Radcliffe really shows Harry on the cusp of adolescence, with emotions beginning to run high and a desperate need to fit in. Rupert Grint is at his best in this film, playing both bumbling fool, and loyal team member. Emma Watson really hit her stride here, and the future is nothing but bright for her.\n\nWe also have some new additions. Michael Gambon had a tremendously difficult job replacing the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, but I was pleased to see that he did not try to copy his predecessor, but rather forge a new path. David Thewlis is a little leering as Lupin, but it matches with his character, so I enjoy it. Gary Oldman is genuinely scary in his big reveal as Sirius Black, but when the character changes towards the film's end, he really sells it.\n\nThis is also John Williams' last time writing the score, and he really brings it home. \"Double Trouble\" creates the perfect tone for the film, and \"Buckbeak's Flight\" is used well at the beginning and end. Sirius' theme was woven in so subtly, I didn't even notice it until this time watching the movie, and I have owned the soundtrack for five years. Bravo, John Williams, bravo.\n\nConsidered by many to be one of the best in the franchise, I have to say that the tone, acting, and structure of the whole film is very well-done. Some big changes are coming to the series, and this is the last film of the original mold.",

Cuaron, though, is to be commended for his distinct visual flair he brings to the picture, and his pacing that, though occasionally slipping into frenzy, is far actively engaging than Columbus's. Armed with great actors and great source material, Cuaron also casts the entire story under the shadow of death, that looms elusively over all.

It's the third installment of the 'Harry Potter 'saga based upon the popular novels of J. K. Rowling. In this film Harry attends his third year at Hogwarts, where he is informed that a dangerous man escaped the Azkaban Prison in order to kill him. A brilliant storyline full of wonderful characters, amazing effects and moments of suspense. I'm a big fan. Reprising their roles are Daniel Radcliffe (the Woman in Black), Emma Watson (Noah), Rupert Grint, Tom Felton (Rise of the Planet of the Apes), Robbie Coltrane (From Hell), Alan Rickman (Die Hard), Maggie Smith (Hook) and Julie Walters (Billy Eliot), and added to the cast are Gary Oldman (the Dark Knight), David Thewlis (the Island of Dr Moreau), Timothy Spall (Sweeney Todd: the Demon Barber of Fleet Street) and Emma Thompson (Nanny McPhoe). \n\nIt's almost Harry Potters (Radcliffe) third year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After running away from his uncles house, he goes to London where he spends the rest of the vacation at the Leaky Cauldron. There he meets his best friends Ron Weasley (Grint) and Hermione Granger (Watson). Together they get on the Hogwarts Express, where they share a compartment with a sleeping professor. On the way, the train stops abruptly and a dark cloaked figure climbs on board. It's a Dementor, a guard from the Wizard Prison Azkaban. As the creature comes toward Harry, the new Defense against the Black Arts teacher Remus Lupin (Thewlis) wakes up and saves the day. \n\nAt Hogwarts, Harry and his friends learn that Dementors will be guarding the School because a dangerous man, called Sirius Black (Oldman), has escaped from Azkaban. As the year progresses and the students attend new classes such as Care of Magical Creatures given by Rubeus Hagrid (Coltrane) and Divination given by the crazy Sybill Trelawney (Thompson), the trio unravels that there is a connection between Sirius Black and Harry...",

This is the closest thing to Terry Gilliam directing a Potter film... can you only imagine how great that would've been? \n\nOnly two scenes break the flow of the film in my opinion- the Knight Bus ride (which is the most a-hyuck goofy sequence) and the whomping willow scene.

New recruits Oldman and Thewlis are fantastic together, and Gambon's turn as Dumbledore (after Richard Harris' regrettably short run) breathes new life into the character, and it's remarkable.\n\nLooking great and sounding great was accomplished by Columbus.

            "content": "Rating-8/10\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third instalment of the hugely popular Harry Potter series of adapted films, and what an important one this is. This is a step up not only from the first two in the franchise, but when looking at the series as a whole, this stands as one of the very best. Technically it's beautiful, directed with an air of class and looks sinister yet underneath holds a loving and philosophical tone.\n\nThis is the kind of movie that many film series just never have, one that stands out and is remembered at times as one with a slightly quirky edge to it. The whole story centres around the escape of convict Sirius Black and basically how frightened all the wizards are because of it, but that's not all this is about. Not including the Quidditch and of course magical lessons, this also contains a kind of heartbreaking story that connects with the main plot to make this an emotional ride, and one that may at times have some reaching for the tissues.\n\nRadcliffe and co return better than before, now they aren't quite top quality yet but there are signs here of what is truly to come in future careers. The addition of David Thewlis makes the teaching staff look even better at acting, Alan Rickman as the ever miserable Snape has still got it and cast members such as Robbie Coltrane(Hagrid) make's a much more emotional display. The producers(among them Christopher Columbus who directed the first two) create a cast that is imaginative yet also strangely dark, creating a lovely fresh new look for the movie's.\n\nThis film cannot be reviewed without mentioning the absolutely magnificent technical achievements coursing though this piece. The cinematography is just amazingly fine, in fact watching this for the camera shots, it is beautiful and the fun ways in which it works makes it stand out to us the viewer too, all credit to Michael Seresin. The sets are well made too, dark yes but it makes this look all together much different from the first two movies, less for the children and more for the growing teenager.\n\nAlfonso Cuaron is the real mastermind behind this movie, directing it in a way I don't think anyone could have imagined. He makes it as previously mentioned quirky, and he lets the more serious scenes run their course, letting the comedy also have it's time in the limelight. Cuaron makes this just generally new looking, you'd struggle to find a fantasy film so serious yet so as if it were made to be overly crazy.\n\nIs it unique, well yes, is it smart well yes I suppose it is but the main point is emotion, now without ruining the ending it could be said emotions run high(without me saying if they're happy or sad). Harry deals with a lot in the movie, and this Harry Potter as well who lets face it, deals with an over abundance of crazy hijinks on a seemingly daily basis, or maybe that could a yearly basis actually. \n\nSo overall a new take on a fantasy series that always brings something new to the frontier of movie making, it's a very good piece and one I am sure that will live on in the minds of movie fans and of course Potter fans, for many many years.",

However, after reading the book, this as my least favorite (so far) still stands.\n\nI wasn't really happy that 40% of the source material is cut in the movie and that irked me a lot. This isn't the very faithful adaptation of the book at all.\n\nHowever, I am still happy that the movie showcased maturity among the main characters from the book. That were the turning points for them.\n\nI LOVED THE TIME TURNER PART. I was amazed how it was executed (mainly because I didn't understand that part in the book). This is my favorite part of the movie.\n\nDirection wise from Alfonso Cuaron, it was good but I hated how many parts from the book have to be cut in favor of adventure. This made me wish Chris Columbus directed the movie but it's too late now......unless I have the time-turner......\n\nSigh, I wish this was a better film adaptation of the book.

            "content": "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was one of my more favourite Harry Potter films for various reasons, and looking back in it now it easy to see why.\n\nDirector Alfonso Cuaron very 1recently won the Academy Award for Best Director for making the 2013 science fiction masterpiece Gravity, and his eerie and tense direction on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban shows early on just how skilled he is as a filmmaker, even when adapting someone else's high-profile material which has to live up to the big name of the series it comes from. Thanks to him, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban proves to reach a new heights for the series which was previously unsurpassed and ensures that it ends up being all that it can be. Even though sometimes minor details drom the story aren't brought into the film adaptation and may leave audiences who haven't read the novel facing minor confusions, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban still proves to be an impressive piece of cinematic fantasy.\nFrom a technical perspective, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a step up from its predecessors in certain areas while maintaining the same lavish production design, costumes and scenery of the previous films.\nThe cinematography in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is exceptional. Instead of following a more conventional route like in its two predecessors, the camera work in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the greatest technical aspect of the film which has stepped up since its predecessors. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban makes use of a lot of great techniques which establish a certain fearful claustrophobia at times as well as using occasional tracking shots which are the magnificent high point of the camera work. The cinematography in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is thoroughly impressive which is no surprise as director Alfonso Cuaron's latest film Gravity also won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, and I believe that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban deserved a nomination for the same award.\nAnd the Academy Award nominated visual effects hit an all new heights in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. With a lot of mythological creatures in its story, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban depicts them practically flawlessly by making their movements a lot more organic and going into a lot of physical detail on the look of them too. There are scenes where certain characters make transformations, and in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban they are done very well with great detail which makes for impressive visual imagery and ensures that the nature of the story has an excellent appearance.\nAlso, the musical score follows the same tune as the previous films while adding a certain touch to it which reveals an unprecedented magic to it which fits into both light and dark territory, establishing its atmosphere as it deals with scenes of both nature.\nWhen it comes down to storytelling, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban explores material a lot darker than in the preceding Harry Potter films. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban touches on the mythology of werewolves and the creation of dementors, a creature iconic of the Harry Potter series. It also goes in to exploring the characters more deeply and the background of Harry Potter's parents and the nature of their death without skipping out on a game of Quidditch and even adding the idea of time travel. While the time travel concept is ignored in later films and could have changed the course of many events for the better which is odd, it's a nice touch to this story.\nAnd as the material of he series grows more and more dark, the cast members mature more and more which makes them step back into their roles with unflinching ease.\nDaniel Radcliffe is great from the start in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and that never changed over the course of the entire feature. Consistently, Daniel Radcliffe captures the harsh reality of being a boy without family on the search for answers as to whose fault it was that he has ended up in that position. And with his age comes an entirely new form of heroism. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the point where Harry Potter begins to transition from being a boy into being a man, and you can see that Daniel Radcliffe increases the ferocity in his line delivery and the emotional tension required for the hero, and so he manages to steal the screen at most moments in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, so it is his best performance in the role to date.\nRupert Grint manages to achieve a similar, albeit lesser feat in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban because as the film series goes on, viewers witness Ron Weasley developing more as a human being and growing in maturity, and Rupert Grint manages to convey that with ease. His easy natured line delivery and relaxed charisma with the surrounding cast is strong while his ability to maintain the childish fear iconic of the character is still easy for him to step up to. Rupert Grint is a fine returning cast member in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\nEmma Watson's role is a step up as well. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the kind of adult wisdom she boasts seems more appropriate because her age seems more believable for the kind of wisdom she carries. And with her age comes a newfound strength and heroism which she handles in the journey that the characters take across the world, so it feels like Emma Watson has found new ways to make the character Hermione Granger all the more stronger since the first time she played the role, rendering it another effective performance. Emma Watson's charm and acting skill just seems to grow with age, and she continues to be impressive.\nAlso, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban features the first performance of Michael Gambon in the role of Albus Dumbledore. While he looks very close to Richard Harris when he was in the role, he portrays Albus Dumbledore in a different light. Instead of making him seem like a tired but wise old man, he conveys him as a strong fighting spirit with an unsuspected heroism to him. The two play him differently but Michael Gambon still takes on the role well and steps into the part with ease which makes him an effective replacement for the role.\nTo date, Robbie Coltrane has not given a more effective performance as Rubeus Hagrid. While he has his funny moments in all of the Harry Potter films, in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban you see a more emotional side to him on the basis of his love for animals, specifically  Hypogrif named Buckbeak this time. The way that Robbie Coltrane interacts with the creature composed out of visual effects feel natural, and when Buckbeak is sentenced to death you can see the tear streaming down his face, the tears of real care for his friend who is about to face a harsh and unfair fate. He interacts with the cast members equally as well, and the strength in his line delivery is rich with emotion. Robbie Coltrane steps up his character dedication for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\nAlan Rickman does a fine job returning to the role of Severus Snape in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and while his role in the film doesn't demand any new challenges from him, he is still an effective presence.\nAnd all the newcomer cast members\ndo their part as well.\nIn the role of Professor Remus Lupin, David Thewlis makes an excellent addition to the cast. While the Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers of the preceding two Harry Potter films have both had a hidden agenda to them which made them bad people, Professor Remis Lupin establishes the idea that he is truly a good person. Davis Thewlis' interactions with the characters in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban feel organic and have a certain sense of friendly appeal to them, so when audiences learn of the surprises that Remus Lupin has kept hidden, they are truly surprised. David Thewlis establishes many surprises in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and he does so with natural ease.\nThe fact that legendary actor Gary Oldman took part in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is just incredible. He is considered one of the most legendary actors of his time and has a key talent for playing villains as he has proven in Air Force One, True Romance and most importantly Leon: The Professional. So in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban it takes no time for audiences to see him as a villain in the role of Sirius Black due to his intense state and ability to deliver his lines with a sharp darkness. But viewers will be in for a surprise when they see the moments in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban when he reveals who he truly is and makes a sympathetic and touching effort where he interacts with the surrounding cast members easily and with a friendly demeanour. Gary Oldman is full of surprises in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and that is what makes him a perfect casing choice.\nTimothy Spall also captures the perfect mysterious and awkward darkness for the role of Peter Pettigrew and manages to make a memorable presence during his brief screen time. \nThe casting of Emma Thompson also proves to be an oddly hilarious touch.\n\nSo riding the talents of its cast, it's ability to stay true to the language and dark mythology of its novel as well as it's superior visual effects and cinematography, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best in the series so far which rides the skills of Alfonso Cuaron's skilful direction from early on in his career.",

Buckbeak is a great character, and is one of the best creatures Rowling has offered us. There are moments that are dark and mysterious, but also nice fun lighthearted moments. Unfortuantely this is the first movie for Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. He didn't do a bad job, but he never did get up to Harris' level. However I can't judge this particular movie based on that as Dumbledore plays a relatively small role in it, and Gambon doesn't put his dark twist on the character until the end.

I like Alfonso Cuaron as director, he definitely made the most of the thin tale. I am trying to be fair with this film(being a ginormous Potter fan, I tend to look with biased eyes), and I decided that this deserves four star I think that this movie is not one my favorite, as I think the viewpoint it took, as well as the numerous cuts made the plot not as suspenseful, and not as good as the book. But it could've been a lot worse I suppose, and overall, it is a splendid movie, and like I said, Cuaron definitely did a good job on it.  I think that the movie took a more ...-dreamy I guess you'd call it- direction, rather then the action-packedness of the Chamber of Secrets and the tension and seriousness of the book. Even though it's a long way from being my #1, it's still a terrific film-so if you have a good movie sense, and especially if you're a Harry Potter fan(though you might feel that it's better put out in the book, like me), don't skip over this movie.\nA-",

It's definitely the strongest movie so far. All the old faces are there, except sadly Richard Harris as Professor Dumbledore, who passed away shortly after the release of The Chamber of Secrets. Thankfully though, another extremely talented actor was brought in for the part, and Michael Gambon adds a little more playful energy to the character.\n\nOur three leads are now fully settled into their roles, and their performances just get stronger and stronger with each film. My only gripe on the acting front is still with Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy. Just such a comic book school bully. Annoying, but not in the way he should be. Thankfully, his contributions are limited, and more than compensated for by two excellent performances from Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, and David Thewlis as Professor Lupin.\n\nOn the technical side of things the visual effects are excellent, and the film is gorgeously photographed. The story too is incredibly intriguing, and should keep you hooked, and guessing right until the end.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThis is a much darker movie that the previous two films, and perhaps a little too intense for really young kids. There's little to no attempt to provide any back story, so watching the first two films in the series is recommended before you take on Azkaban.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThis is a stunning looking film. If a theater were re-screening this it would be worth seeing on a big clear digital screen. At home, and HD viewing over a decent surround sound system is recommended.\n\nBest moment for me:\n\nI love the scene where Harry Potter gets the ride Buckbeak for the first time. John William's score is beautiful, and the visuals are breathtaking.",

There's a lot more humour in The Prisoner Of Azkaban, mainly delivered by Emma Thompson as the nutty teacher whose look and behaviour is quirky, plus Harry Potter uses the invisibility cloak for a bit of fun this time around which is what I was waiting for. David Thewlis is a fantastic addition to the cast, as is Gary Oldman, and these two new characters arouse suspicion keeping you guessing. But here is the reason I've given this third addition my lowest score yet, the pace slacks once Harry and Hermione go back in time and meddle with it, it's a predictable subplot and to be truly honest rather pointless and the whole scene feels like an outsider to the rest of the movie, I knew immediately that the glowing figure at the Dementor lake scene was Harry and not his father. I've got to say Azkaban is rather uneventful as there's nothing that magical or enchanting about it, but as always the world of Potter looks stunning, the cast are excellent and entertaining and it's still a worthy addition.",

But \"The Prisoner of Azkaban\" triumphs in this way, shedding the excess and coming out as one of the better Harry Potter films.\n\nThis film is the beginning of the series's transition to a darker tone.  But the film does match the darkness with some fun moments.  While some moments are dark and dreary (particularly Harry's internal struggles), the film finds time for some fun moments too (like when Harry is riding Buckbeak).  The balance is great, and gets me excited for the darker movies to come.  This film also does an excellent job of interpretating things from the book.  The film does a great job of transitioning Hogsmeade, Buckbeak, the Marauder's Map, and the Dementors from the page to the screen, and really brings them to life.\n\nThe cast once again gives a solid performance.  Gary Oldman and David Thewlis join the cast as Sirius Black and Remus Lupin and do an outstanding job.  And Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid brings the character to life in ways not even imaginable.\n\nAs with the two previous films, I recommend \"The Prisoner of Azkaban\" because it is (aside from the extraneous Quidditch subplot) a close interpretation of the book.  While it doesn't explain the time-travel paradox any better than the book, it does have the fun and magic of its predecessors, with the maturity of its successors.

The plot twists here are really interesting and do work to the films advantage. In my opinion, all of it is perfect. But personally I didnt like the ending. I kind of wanted to see Harry be adopted by Sirius and see their life together, but I guess that would just be too \"happily ever after\" for this series. If Alfonso Cuaron, who directed this years smash hit Gravity, directed more of these films, then maybe I'd see more of why people regard these films as timeless masterpieces. By far, this is the best \"Potter\" yet.",

You can immediately tell that this is a different take on Harry Potter than the previous two installments. Gone are the days of cute sorting hats and bright colourful quidditch games. This film is much darker in its tone, it's score, it's themes of redemption and sacrifice and even it's colour palette. It's often very gray with lots of dark colours. The acting took another giant step forward especially in the scene in the Shrieking Shack. I also like how the finale is not some all out duel like the previous two. Not that the other two weren't entertaining but this whole segment is suspenseful and intriguing. Overall, you can tell that this film franchise would change for the better once it was handed from Chirs Columbus (famous for his children's films like The Goonies and Home Alone) to Alfonso Cuaron, a director known for making violent gritty dramas in Mexico. Someone with a different style who was more focused on the story, characters, acting, and scene direction than fan service.

The first 20 minutes are just pure crap with rushed plot points, bad acting, and pointless humor.  The movie does not actually get good until we see the Dementor searching the train. The Dementors and Buckbeak were amazingly well done, however, and we are introduced to Sirius Black and Remus Lupin, two of my all time favorite characters.

            "content": "I don't intentionally set out to disagree with everyone else, but ... I think this was the worst of the entire series.  Typically, it's the most freaking popular as well.  I just don't get it, and here's why.  The director, Alfonso Cuaron, is remarkably talented - (I only say this because he directed 'Children Of Men') - but, in my opinion, 'Harry Potter' doesn't need the visionary kind of director that Cuaron aspires to be.  He certainly makes it an eccentric and entertaining movie, with some very interesting (they weren't all bad) ideas on how to deliver the film's more dramatic moments.  But I don't want just \"quirky\" and \"interesting\", goddamit.  The novel was flipping amazing, and significantly darker than the last two books.  And although I love the second novel, this was the first one to really explore the dramas and relationships between the teenage characters.  And don't give me that shit about this film being the darkest of the lot - it's NOT.  It's bleak, and it's gothic - creepy in a Halloween-at-primary-school sort of way - but every attempt it makes at genuine scariness is crushed by the director's insistence on infusing the same childish humour so perfectly captured in the first two films.  That ... or the film just comes across weird.  Like, what's with Lupin's dopey face when he first casts away the Dementor on the train? The scene was awesome until that moment.  And then there's the entire sequence in the Shrinking Shack (that's its name, isn't it?) which unravels more like a bunch of drama students performing in their classroom; go watch it again, and tell me that Snape's sudden entrance has the slightest effect on you.  I'd prefer not to go into the freeze-frame at the end, with Harry screaming \"yeah!!!\" as he takes off on his broom.  That's my main problem with the film; it's considered to be the darkest - some douches even call it the first \"decent\" one - but I think it gets ruined by the director's egotistical determination in making it so totally unlike the others.  Even the acting doesn't seem as natural this time around, and the script is often nonsensical when it made complete sense in the book - such as the part when Harry just happens to spot Dumbledore and McGonagal in Hogsmeade, who have come all the way over to some nondescript pub, for the sheer purpose of describing Harry's relationship with Serius Black with people who have nothing to do with anything; in the novel, Harry overhears them in the dining area, because they naturally come onto the subject in conversation, so why couldn't the film just do that? In the end, it's all about Alfonso Cuaron, and how \"original\" he can be.  The source material, the well-written drama between Ron and Hermione - basically everything I loved in the book - is here cast into the wind.  And as punishment, the film has been heralded as the most lasting of all the 'Harry Potter' movies.  Like I said ... I just don't get it.",

The book was my favorite so far and now that the Lord of the Rings trilogy had run it's course, I really wanted to see something similar in it's contemporary.  By now, I had already read five books in the franchise and had been disappointed at times but we'll get to that later.  At the age of 17 I was beginning to see that the first two films were indeed a bit childish and tried to avoid them whenever they became available, but was pretty damn well hoping for a more mature film in Prisoner.  And my god was it.  The directing might be to \"blame\", as Hogwarts has become more mysterious and darker in design and feel than it's more \"enchanted castle\" feel of previous, the child actors are now showing signs of becoming better at their performances, and...I might get a lot of hate mail for this but I thought the recasting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore was better and he should have been in the role from the very start.  I dunno, he just seems to have more of the wizard feel in him, and that sort of \"new feel\" of the film is what makes it great.  Not to mention that it actually got an actor I had heard of before, GARY OLDMAN! And personally I think his performance as Sirius Black is one of his best yet.  Another thing to take note of is that this film was substantially shorter than either of the previous two, yet seems to cover so much more in less time.  Also...fuckin' Dementors, what can I say about them? They're pretty damn creepy and honestly seeing Harry just go nuts feels fairly sad, to be honest.  So overall Prisoner had the most adult-ness so far in the franchise, the child actors were coming into their own, the directing was fantastic, the time travel scene(s) (which honestly I thought was going to be very condensed in this adaption) was/were very great, and overall it's one of only two Harry Potter films that still holds up to this day.  But two things:\n\n(1): In the end when Harry flies his Firebolt (please don't make any innuendo-related comments), and the frame stops with him yelling...I like to imagine there's a cookie there and that's why he was yelling in joy.  Just a little LOLness for you.\n\n(2): If you look at the DVD cover it kinda looks like Daniel Radcliffe was...a bit aroused, it seems.",

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban takes everything that made the first two films great, and expands upon them, making this easily the best Potter film so far.\n\nHarry Potter and friends are once again studying at Hogwarts, though the escape of an insane murderer named Sirius Black threatens the lives of everyone at Hogwarts, namely Harry.\n\nThe characters are as lovable as ever, music is great, acting is (mostly) solid, etc.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban avoids many of the pitfalls of the first two films, and manages to bring a whole lot of new magic to the series.\n\nThe story, while seemingly simple at first, becomes more and more complex as the story unwinds.  The plots for the original was relatively simple, and while the sequel's plot was a large improvement, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban takes things a step further.\n\nThe visual effects are significantly better in this film than the previous two.  Magical spells and creatures come to life in a more real and convincing way than the previous two films ever managed.\n\nDespite a nearly 2 and a half hour length, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is entertaining from start to finish, with few moments of exception.  There are loads of memorable scenes packed into this film, from suspenseful action scenes, amusing spell and magic displays, and some very polished use of time travel at the end.\n\nThe acting is good, but as is expected of child actors, some more emotional scenes are performed quite poorly (and dare I say it; laughably).  I'm specifically referring to Daniel Radcliffe, who's acting as Harry Potter is good, but he simply cannot convey the emotional complexity his character is demanding.  The other actors are good (including Michael Gambon who replaces Richard Harris as Dumbledore), though Emma Thompson as Sybill Trelawney steals every scene she's in (though admittedly, she's not in many).\n\nThe score, composed by John Williams, features a diversity that's not evident in the previous two scores.  Moments of fun and intense action are scored pitch perfect by the master composer.  This is the last Potter film that Williams scored for, but it seems that Williams really brought his A-game for his last outing at Hogwarts.\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is funnier, smarter, and more exciting than anything witnessed in the previous two films.  Massively entertaining, and certainly magical, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a superb fantasy film.",

            "content": "\"Turn to page 394.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that sounds like the beginning of another Harry Potter review. This time, it's the third chapter of the franchise, Alfonso Cuaron's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\r\n\r\nIn Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts, criminal Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), known for helping Voldemort in the death of Harry's parents, breaks out of Azkaban prison, and vows revenge on Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) for defeating his follower. Because of this, Hogwarts is heavily guarded by Dementors, Azkaban guards who can suck out a person's soul, and also have a huge craving for Harry. Harry discovers some twists and turns about Sirius and vows to kill him before his enemy does.\r\n\r\nContinuing their appearances in the franchise include Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, Alan Rickman as Snape (he says the opening quote in my review, by the way), Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, who is now a professor of Magical Creatures (the creature is the hippogriff, Buckbeak), Robert Hardy as Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Julie Walters and Mark Williams as the Weasley parents, and Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw as the Durselys.\r\n\r\nNew actors appearing in this film includes Michael Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, David Thewlis as Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Lupin, who has a dark secret, Emma Thompson as Divination professor Trelawney, who's a bit of a creep, Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew, a mysterious man who turns out to be a rat, and Pam Farris as Aunt Marge, Harry's evil aunt who gets literally blown up by Harry after she insults his parents.\r\n\r\nAfter Chris Columbus directed the first two films, in a decent way, he left and the franchise was taken over by Alfonso Cuaron, who's best known feature before this would be the fantasy classic which I've never seen before, A Little Princess. Cuaron took a more darker approach, even altering the outside look of Hogwarts to fit his vision. And I must say, Cuaron's direction is the best take on the franchise at this point.\r\n\r\nOne of the problems with the two Columbus films, particularly Sorcerer's Stone, was making the films stay 100% true to the book, resulting in a slower pace. It was fixed a bit in Chamber of Secrets, even though it was ten minutes longer. Prisoner of Azkaban, on the other hand, is 10 minutes shorter than Sorcerer's Stone, has some original things going on in this (meaning that it's not 100% true to the book, but still keeping the spirit of the book, which is how a great film adaptation should be), and gives us the quickest pace the franchise has given us so far.\r\n\r\nCuaron's direction is just brilliant. While darker, as evident in the change of looks in the outside of Hogwarts, it's the most realistic, with the three main leads, particularly Radcliffe, going in a mature direction. In one scene, when he discovers a shocking truth about Sirius, he hollers, \"I hope he finds me, cause if he does, I'm gonna kill him,\" which is probably the darkest thing Harry's ever said. Rupert Grint also matures, while still in fear of everything, particularly the tree that nearly killed him in Chamber of Secrets. And Emma Watson? She's fantastic, and SHE' ONLY 13! Not only is her character the \"brightest witch of her age\", but has the most heart of everyone in the franchise. Say what you want about Radcliffe, Watson steals the show, kid actor wise.\r\n\r\nAs in the other films, the acting in the adult cast is brilliant. I'm still huge on Alan Rickman as Snape, and he has some of his best lines in this film (the page 394 line and \"Turn out your pockets.\"). Even though she's not in it that much, Maggie Smith as McGonagall is another highlight in the film (Don't worry Maggie, you'll get your true potential in the final chapter). While I missed Richard Harris as Dumbledore, his replacement, Michael Gambon is so good in the role that you don't even feel a change of actors. David Thewlis is pretty entertaining as Lupin, and even feels like a father figure to Harry, which I enjoyed, while Emma Thompson is creepy and weird, but in a good way, as the Divination teacher. But of the new actors, it's Gary Oldman as Sirius Black who really delivers. His character has the most twists in him, and while I won't give it away to late newcomers, Oldman makes a complex character and turns it into something done easy.\r\n\r\nLike in the other films, the visuals are phenomenal. From the aunt blowing up, to the fast and crazy Knight Bus, to an insane Quidditch match in a rainstorm, to the Dementors, to Buckbeat the hippogriff, to the crazy climax involving time travel, each CG effect is first rate and proves without a doubt that CG can be done right in good hands.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban would be the final film to be scored by John Williams, and his last score for the franchise is definitely the best score of the three. His score shows his dark side while keeping the traditional John Williams sound. When the time travel climax shows up, I love that you hear a clock ticking in the background when there's no clock around. Williams is a pure composing genius. Nuff said.\r\n\r\nThanks to Cuaron's darker and realistic direction, improved, mature acting from our three leads, first-rate visuals, and John William's best score in the franchise, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban proves that a third chapter can be done right and is one of the strongest films in the franchise.\r\n\r\n\"I solemnly swear I am up to no good.\"",

They got time turners, they have the ability to control \"time\". They are just scared of the \"space-time continuum\", and they are not willing to use them. With these devices, they can reverse the realities that Cedric Diggory's death, Voldy's return, Sirius' death, James and Lily Potter's death, maybe even assassinate the death eaters when they are at their infancy, prevent the birth of Voldemort and/or his lieutenants... The possibilities are limitless. If a non-magical person got hands on that, he or she may be able to travel back in time to teach the magical personnels the are of melee combat, thereby removing their dependent of combatting with wands. Personally, I think the author made a \"tactical\" mistake when she wrote \"There is no spell that can bring the dead back to life\" after she wrote the chapter of the time turner, because there is, and it's a big spell.

Respons\u00e1vel pelos primeiros dois cap\u00edtulos da saga Harry Potter) para o veterano e grande cineasta mexicano Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. O que Cuar\u00f3n faz neste cap\u00edtulo da franquia Harry Potter \u00e9 amadurec\u00ea-la em todos os sentidos da palavra: visualmente, narrativamente e tecnicamente. Al\u00e9m disto, o novo diretor consegue trazer um clima de \"inf\u00e2ncia melanc\u00f3lica\", representando tudo que a s\u00e9rie de livros de J.K Rowling se prop\u00f5e a fazer (mostrar as dificuldades, ang\u00fastias e medos do personagem principal, Harry), alcan\u00e7ado com mesmo \u00eaxito em filmes anteriores seus, como o muito bom \"A Princesinha\".\nAl\u00e9m de ser absolutamente muito bem fotografado, o filme consegue estabelecer uma nova estrutura de Hogwarts, muito mais interessante e criativa do que a do castelo dos longas anteriores (as cenas externas, por exemplo, s\u00e3o simplesmente sensacionais!). Al\u00e9m disto, Cuar\u00f3n faz algo que Columbus nunca foi capaz de fazer, que \u00e9 passear com a c\u00e2mera pelos corredores de Hogwarts, fazendo com que o espectador se sinta mais por dentro daquele mundo fant\u00e1stico. Os efeitos especiais impressionam, como tamb\u00e9m se tornam fundamentais para que a hist\u00f3ria prossiga. A trilha sonora nunca esteve t\u00e3o perfeita, com o predom\u00ednio de flautas e vozes em vez de piano ou violinos, dando um tom mais m\u00edstico ao filme. Al\u00e9m de tudo, Cuar\u00f3n consegue criar cenas absolutamente inesquec\u00edveis, entre elas o voo do Bicu\u00e7o (uma mistura perfeita de som, fotografia e efeitos especiais), a transforma\u00e7\u00e3o da tia Guida em um bal\u00e3o (incrivelmente divertida!) e a cena em que Harry consegue executar o feiti\u00e7o do Patrono, espantando todos os dementadores do lago (um dos momentos mais emocionantes de toda a s\u00e9rie!).\nTendo todas essas qualidades executadas com perfei\u00e7\u00e3o, \"Prisioneiro de Azkaban\" se sai melhor ainda em outro quesito importante: atua\u00e7\u00f5es. A introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de novos e grandes atores ingleses como Gary Oldman (que interpreta um Sirius Black com perfei\u00e7\u00e3o) e Emma Thompson (a professora Trelawney que eu sempre imaginei nos livros) aumenta mais ainda a qualidade do filme. Al\u00e9m disto, a substitui\u00e7\u00e3o de Richard Harris por Michael Gambon como o Professor Dumbledore (em um estilo meio hippie e jovial e menos o Merlin velho e cansado interpretado por Harris) \u00e9 fant\u00e1stica! Gambon se encaixa perfeitamente no papel, tornando o Dumbledore uma figura mais divertida e menos chata do que a dos filmes anteriores.  Al\u00e9m disto, o trio (Daniel, Rupert e Emma) provam que evolu\u00edram muito como Harry, Rony e Hermione, deixando de ser as \"carinhas bonitinhas\" dos dois primeiros filmes para se tornarem bons atores adolescentes.  \nMe espanto quando lembro de quantas vezes j\u00e1 assisti e re-assisti todos os filmes da s\u00e9rie Harry Potter. O mais engra\u00e7ado \u00e9 que sempre quando me volto \u00e0 este terceiro filme, acabo imaginando uma coisa: \"ser\u00e1 que se Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n tivesse dirigido todos os filmes da saga, teria Harry Potter (cinematograficamente falando) tirado alguns \u00d3scars do Senhor dos An\u00e9is?!\". Um excelente trabalho e o melhor filme da s\u00e9rie j\u00e1 feito, sem sombra de d\u00favidas.",

Most decidedly the best of the Potter films, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' helms a new director: Alfonso Cauron, taking over from Chris Colombus from the enchanting first two films.  Cauron makes the film fast paced, emotionally satisfying, humerous, and truly magical.  The attention to detail here must be noted!  Cauron puts tiny bits of color, if you will, by making this world real.  We see a bartender who simply waves his hand and the tables clean themselves, or quills that write on their own.  Cauron wisely introduces us to certain themes or places early on in the film.  The whomping willow, a moving tree that will kill you before allowing you to move close to it, becomes in and of itself: a character.  It's used as a guide for the season, but also allows us to get to know the tree so that by the time we get to a scene where the triplet must find a way passed it, We know exactly what it is and what danger they're in.  Elements from the novel by J.K. Rowling are played with such creativity and believability.  The Maurader's Map could have easily become a joke, but Cauron designs it with precision, making it a uniquely magical and dangereous object.  Performances are also topnotch: Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson especially, and the three kids make the film a fun and exhuberant rollar coaster.  'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is an instant classic that can be enjoyed time and time again.",

Everything in this movie just pops, I love the style and atmosphere Alfonso Cuaron brought to this entry. It`s dark, gothic, stylish and brilliant. First off I have to say this is the point when Emma, Daniel and Rubert felt convincing and genuine as the three main characters. They are maturing and so is the franchise. Their performances were excellent and you will keep on seeing them improve through out, but this was the turning point when they hit the nail on it`s head. The Prisoner of Azkaban`s plot involves heavier and deeper themes, the imagery has this gothic feel to it, and the dialouge has improved tremendously. It just feels solid in every way. Alfonso is the greatest director this franchise has seen due to the fantastic ability he has to make every camera shot so beautiful and meaningful, this is especially prominant in the end sequence were everything falls in place. There weren`t any plotholes that I could find which can easily be made with time travel. The ending/ entire film was expertly put together with every single detail in mind. The effects are stunning. The characters are great and well developed. The script is a masterpiece, just simply put a masterpiece. Everything comes together in a great way, the pacing , the conflicts, the drama, it`s all perfect. I might sound like a fanboy now but I just don`t see any flaws here. I`m not the over analyzing type because I feel that it can ultimately ruin every movie but from the way I watch movies this had absolutely no flaws and provides complex storytelling full packed with wonderful effects and spectacular cinematography.",

You could pick out which are puppets, and which are CGI. In my opinion, the CGI could have been better in a few scenes. \r\n\r\nThe acting is probably the best part of the movie. All the actors appeared to be comfortable in their roles. Those who uttered the nonsensical \"magic words\" to cast spells made you believe that the words were able to conjure up a magical spell. \r\n\r\nOne problem that stuck out like a sore thumb to me is the over-the-top performances of the actors in the minor roles/cameos. Obviously these were meant to be comic relief, but they just didn't seem all that funny to me. I also didn't like the blond kid who bullied \"Harry Potter\" and his friends, he just didn't seem to be that much of a bully. \r\n\r\nAnother thing I noticed were some weird edits. Many of which were when the scenes were changing to continue the story. They weren't done well at all. Sound was also a bit of a problem.

After Richard Harris who played the original Dumbledore died, Chris Columbus who directed the first two Harry Potter movies left the franchise so therefore the role of Dumbledore went to Michael Gambon and the third movie is directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. The story is about Harry who returns to school for his third year after fighting with the Dursleys and returning to his friends but he finds out that there are hundreds of ghostly/demonic guards known as Dementors are after Harry believing that he might know about the first escaped prisoner of the wizarding prison of Azkaban. It turns out they are right; Harry now needs to find out about the connection he has with the prisoner and himself and how they're related in anyway to his parents or him. This sequel is very important both to me and the franchise and it shouldn't be underrated. It shows the time where the characters are going through a big dramatic change after the first two films and they are finding more about themselves. I own two DVDs of this film: one which my uncle bought me a long time ago and and a 1-Disc DVD that came along with the first four Harry Potter films in one pack and this was during the time before Harry Potter 5 came out.

Everything in the movie is better  : Better directing this time from Alfonso Cuaron although this brings in the inconsistency in the franchise because its predecessors were totally with the book . The direction brings a lot of changes to the original text . However that is not alogether bad. Certain actors are changed . Michael Gambon comes in for Richard Harris as the Hogwarts headmaster and well in my opinion that was a welcome change. Although it was because of an unfortunate event but we get to see a different side to Dumbledore. Also Harry has grown up and and that change is excellently portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe. This time around the plot is seriously dark with a murderer lurking around . The plot is more gripping with excellent twists and some brilliant performances from Rupert Grint and Emma Watson . We are introduced to two new important characters : Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. Black is portrayed by the famous Gary Oldman who does it masterfully while Lupin is portrayed by David Thewlis who does an excellent job. The screenplay is brilliant , the emotional core of the movie is excellent and Sir John Williams does an amazing job this time around with beautiful themes. Now comes the visuals  : they have drastically improved - the Hippogriff scene was the best . Excellent CGI work was put up there. The sets were brilliant. We also get to see more of Hogwarts. There is less fantasy this time around than the predecessors but we get new to see new places like Hogsmeade , Shrieking Shack . However the focus of the movie has shifted more towards the characters rather than the world which might disappoint a lot of purists. The innocence is lost , inconsistency creeps in but these are no reasons for preventing the film to become an excellent one both tonally and magically.",

The characters are still good going along with the faster-paced plot, the CG effects were great in the last two, but it seems to fit more in this one. This one also has a darker tone than 1 and 2, (the dementors) but still not quite at its darkest as it managed to retain its PG rating. We are also introduced to a new actor for Dumbledore, who doesn't get as much screen time, but that changes over the course of the films, and his acting gets a lot better.

            "content": "This third addition to the Harry Potter canon is a great improvement over the first two with an even darker atmosphere, matured acting, a complex story, and improved direction overall. \n\nPLOT:Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) returns to Hogwarts for his third year after a big fiasco with his aunt and other family, but with great care. This year at Hogwarts, a watch is out for the escaped murderer, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who is rumored to be after Harry himself for some strange reason. Posted around every major entrance to Hogwarts is one of many Dementors, which are dark, ghostly creatures that feed off of people's lives and happiness. Harry, after a conflict with one on the train that caused him to faint, has grown a fear for the Dementors. This year is like treading on broken glass for Harry and his friends, for there's a killer on the loose, there are dangerous guards on every corner, and the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), has a bit of a mystery behind him. Will Harry and the rest solve the mysteries behind Sirius Black and the rest? I'll leave you there. It's a brilliant plot executed excellently. \n\nACTING:The performances in this Harry Potter film are even better than that of its predecessor. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have really matured by this point in their roles as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. By now, you can tell they're teens with more of a clue of what they're doing. Their acting skill has built up a lot by now. You could say that the same follows for most of the other youth performances as well. Of the adult performances, the introduction of Gary Oldman as Sirius Black and David Thewlis as Professor Lupin were excellent. Gary Oldman played a great part as the convicted prisoner, and David Thewlis did brilliant as well as the strange professor. The other great adult performances would have to be from Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley, Emma Thomspon as Professor Trelawaney, and Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew. All of these performance, returning and new, convinced me and just showed evidence of very skilled acting. The other couple of performances I would like to mention in specifics would be Lenny Henry as the shrunken head and Dawn French as the fat lady in the painting. \n\nSCORE:The score in this addition was a little more intense than the past two have been, with a choral song added into the mix. John Williams, returning to the Harry Potter score chair, does a really good job at conducting the score to this one. \n\nEFFECTS:The effects in this one were really good as well. The effects aren't as fresh as they were before, but it was still pretty cool to see the Dementors and the Hippogriff in action. The Dementors and their effects had to be the coolest of all the effects in this film. \n\nOTHER CONTENT:This film is probably one of the best of the Harry Potter films out there. Unlike the first two, this addition has a more complex story to tell with many more secrets to find out and more aspects to play with, such as time travel. Along with the matured performances and more complex story/storytelling, this film adds a darker atmosphere to the franchise and shows evidence of a change in direction. The tone was pretty dark in this film's predecessor, but the addition of certain death, intense family struggle, and murder scandal make this one a more mature film overall. Aside from character development, this film could almost stand on its own without any assistance from the other films in the franchise. This one I really enjoyed in particular for its story, tone, and change of direction, for it births a more mature film all around. \n\nOVERALL,an epic Harry Potter film with a brilliant plot, matured and convincing performances, more in-depth and intense score, cool effects, a more complex story, a darker tone, and an evident change in direction.",

My only problem with this installment of the Potter series had to do with the fact that I felt like Cuaron expected everyone who saw this movie to have read the books.  Most of the other films gave viewers at least enough information to be able to catch on to the main points of the story, but in this I noticed some very key points missing, and certain friends of mine who had not read the books were slightly confused.  I attribute this mainly to a complete failure to mention anything about the true identities of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs.  As far as most filmgoers knew, they were just names on a map, and Lupin's knowledge of the map's power was purely coincidence.  I suppose I also had problems with Hermione's character, not only because I am not a fan of Emma Watson's \"overuse-the-eyebrows\" acting style, but because the filmmakers, (and I don't just mean Cuaron.  They are still doing it to this day), have made Hermione Granger far less nerdy than she needs to be.  The whole \"punching Malfoy in the face\" bit was extremely out of character, at least by the standards of someone who is deeply into the book series.  Aside from that, though, it was a thoroughly enjoyable film, and I was thrilled at the addition of Gary Oldman to the cast.",

The storytelling and wizardry is once again excellent as always in this Harry Potter film and it doesn't disappoint on those fronts at all. The character development is actually here and you get to learn more and more backstory on the characters while also having them go through more interesting conflicts. I do like this film a lot more than I did before and in my opinion, it is on par with the other two predecessors which I think are really underrated and really well directed films despite most people saying that the first two are the worst in the franchise.",

I also loved the element of time travel at the middle of the film when most of the secrets are revealed in this film. But overall this film was just a very good approach to a Harry potter film.  Also I love that there's more relationships going on in this film and just much more drama in general. So in the end just a grate and important pice to the Harry potter puzzle. Also one more thing that I compleatly loved was that this films bad guy element was diffrent that the first two. Cause in the first two you just find out who the bad guys are and just defeate them. In this film the real bad guy has a secret that changes your view on him and another bad guy gets revealed but not defeated in this film. So overall I just thought it was good to get a breth of fresh air to be honised and this film truly offered that.",

            "content": "Out of the eight Harry Potter movies, only one stands out as both A) Being well-directed, acted, and scripted and B) Not ruining my childhood and in turn my enjoyment of Harry Potter in general. This momentary respite from the drudgery of the films is The Prisoner of Azkaban, the outlier of the series and a strong film all around. However, let me stress that this movie is an anomaly in every sense of the word, and in no way sets a standard for the series as a whole. In fact, after this movie, things just started getting even shittier. But I still remember the brief period of time in my life where I actually had some hope for this franchise. And it's all thanks to this film.\r\n\r\nThe third film in the Harry Potter franchise is based off of the best of the books, The Prisoner of Azkaban. In this movie, the man who gave away Harry's parent's location (allowing for them to be killed) has escaped a highly guarded prison and is now on the run. A great skinny of this movie's charm comes from this character, Sirius Black, who is played by Gary Oldman. Oldman is possibly one of the most underrated actors working today, and has a habit of completely immersing himself in his roles. He fills the gap in the movies left by a massive lack of good acting. But fortunately, he's not alone, because this is the film with which Emma Watson actually solidified herself as a good actress. Among all the silliness of the movie, she delivers a very non-magical and much-deserved punch to Tom Felton's sneering face. God, that guy will never live this role down. \r\n\r\nOf course, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert \"The Soulless Ginger\" Grint remain just as uncharismatic and wooden as ever, but they're helped along by the mysteriousness of the plot and the sheer mythology of many of the scenes. Sure, they're not good actors, but when the Dementors are sucking their souls out, the audience couldn't care less. And yes, there are massive plot holes here... for instance, why the fuck can't the Dementors tell the difference between Harry and someone who actually, you know, poses a threat? But the plot holes here are far less glaring and noteworthy than in the previous two films, and it also does away with a lot of the cliched, corny dialogue that is sure to sicken audiences to their cores.\r\n\r\nA lot of this film's assets are owed to two things. The first is director Alfonso Cuaron, who also is responsible for the spectacular film Children of Men and the far less interesting yet still critically acclaimed Gravity. Cuaron has a knack for visual flair, but also knows how to actually give his actors some motivation in their scenes. He even manages to squeeze a few decent lines out of Grint and Radcliffe, a feat unmatched in the rest of this franchise. Also, a better Dumbledore and David Thewlis as a werewolf/teacher (whoops, spoilers) makes the acting a lot more interesting. It is Cuaron's cinematography and enchanting visuals that really makes a lot of this film, though, especially the scenes with Buckbeak, as well as the final sequence with the Patronus. God, I sound like such a friggin' nerd.\r\n\r\nThe second contributing factor to this film's half-success is the plot. I'm a sucker for time travel stories, and this one is a doozy. When people try to pick apart time travel stories, it never ceases to irk me-- Sure, there are paradoxes set up. That's kind of the point. You can't possibly complain about the Kyle Reese/John Connor paradox in The Terminator, because James Cameron could easily have omitted that whole endless loop if he wanted to. It's an intentional paradox and an artistic choice, neither of which you can fault a movie for. Also, the way Cuaron re-imagined the time turner was fantastic. Altogether, the final act of this movie is unexpectedly great and far surpasses anything that Chris \"Piss\" Columbus could manage. It does kind of set up plot holes for the rest of the movies (I can think of plenty of instances in which that time turner would have come in handy), but that's their problem.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: 6/10 stars. Out of all the Potter films, this is the only one that even comes close to matching the brilliance of the books, with stronger characters and a far better story. If Alfonso Cuaron had stuck around for the other films, this series could have made a serious recovery. But instead Cuaron moved on and the next film in the series went to the genius behind Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Oh, joy.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, Emma Watson is almost old enough to be hot! But only if you're 14. -1.\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED FOR THE FOURTH INSTALLMENT OF THIS SPECIAL EDITION OF TUT'S TUTILLATING REVIEWS: HARRY POTTER AND THE RAPE OF MY CHILDHOOD! Coming soon!",

            "content": "After two films director Chris Columbus decided to walk away from directing Harry Potter films, so in the search of a replacement Warner chose my fellow countryman Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n to make the third chapter of the saga, the film that is remembered as the best of the 8 films and the lowest grossing of the all: \"Prisoner of Azkaban\".\n\nIn his third year in Hogwarts, Potter and his friends face a new menace, but this time it comes from outside the walls of Hogwarts: A highly dangerous criminal has escaped Azkaban, the most secure prison of the magical world, and is on the hunt of Potter. \n\nChanging the person that sits in the director's chair is a more than wise decision for a franchise as it injects new blood as each chapter goes on and Cuar\u00f3n manages to take this child friendly franchise and give it a mature style. \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" suffers from an improvement in the acting department (the trio fells more confident in their respective roles), the cinematography is gorgeous (even if it's palette is mostly grays or grayish blues) and the best of the franchise, the script is more condense and less faithful to the source material (which is something this franchise desperately needed), Williams' score is the best of the franchise (it may not be as iconic as the one he made for \"Philosopher's Stone\" but is more powerful and overall more involving), the story is the more subtle of the 8 films as it is 100% focused on character development unlike its predecessor, Cuar\u00f3n's directing manages to create a perfect balance of whimsical and spooky tone and his attention to detail gives more personality to the world plus his camera work is as remarkable, to say the least, as always; the new characters are welcome additions (Gary Oldman is just freaking perfect in his role and is the most fun presence of the film), the special effects are seamless, and the pacing issues of Columbus films are mostly gone. But needless to say, this film has problems. The ending is a little frustrating as it just introduces a huge problem solver (downright Deus Ex Machina) that eliminates any tension (which is why it is never used again) and this is the chapter that starts with the plot holes (from now on every Potter film will break/bend the rules stablished for this world or start to include convenient artifacts just to be forgotten on the next film). \n\n\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" is hands down the best Harry Potter film as it is the one film of the franchise that focuses on character development rather than world building or mindless action intertwined by a generic plot. It is as captivating and charming as the first film but it's more mature and it has a far superior crew behind cameras that managed to inject new blood to the saga (this film is so well made that it manages to hold its own regardless of its two predecessors).",

The highlight of this movie is that the Harry Potter series escapes its 'kid-savy' feel & transitions flawlessly into the more complex & unbarred story it desperately needs to be. \n3. Acting-wise, I was very impressed with the performances of the 'big three', showing that they could handle the spotlight even when it grew much bigger and demanded way more out of them. Their maturity & improvements throughout the series(so far) displays their commitment to their roles.\nConclusion: Changed the face of the franchise for the better in what is Cuar\u00f3n's most successful film.",

After recently watching the movie with someone who hasn't read the book, I found myself answering countless questions to clarify scenes that could have easily been extended by a few minutes to clearly explain the situation. In fact, simply by slowing down the erratic machine-gun paced voices much more could have adequately been revealed. He also allowed some pretty terrible casting choices... but I won't get into that. The movie was full of unnecessary and/or just wrong scenes. The pointless cutaways to the Whomping Willow were just time drainers. Harry using Lumos at the Dursley's... What? I could go on, but I won't.\n\nOf course, I don't hate this movie; mostly because it's just good enough to recall the nostalgia of the book.",

Before Cuaron could get his clutches on the series Columbus was making the first installments true to the novel but he wasn't attempting to make anything better. Cuaron on the other hand went the extra mile and tried to make good spots of the novel great and great spots amazing. \r\n\r\nOverall a great improvement on the series. It stays true to the novel but at the same time creating enough creative juices to flow in to make it fell fresh and new. Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson add a fresh new quality to the series to with their charismatic performances. I wouldn't go as far as to give this movie a full 100% but a 90% would be fitting.",
