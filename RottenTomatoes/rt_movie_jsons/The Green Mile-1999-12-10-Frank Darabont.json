    "summary": "Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) walked the mile with a variety of cons. He had never encountered someone like John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a massive black man convicted of brutally killing a pair of young sisters. Coffey had the size and strength to kill anyone, but not the demeanor. Beyond his simple, naive nature and a deathly fear of the dark, Coffey seemed to possess a prodigious, supernatural gift. Paul began to question whether Coffey was truly guilty of murdering the two girls.",

Coffey lands himself on death row for the murder of two young girls but as more about his character is revealed, Edgecomb suspects Coffey may not be guilty after all.\n\nThis synopsis, which may seem to expose too much of the plot, is only scratching the surface of this raw and honest portrayal of capital punishment. Within the span of three hours, I experienced pain, joy, resentment, relief, among a suite of other emotions. By the end of the film, I felt deeply moved and introspective.\n\nTom Hanks delivers a stellar performance as Paul Edgecomb, balancing his responsibilities on death row with a gripping moral conflict. However, my favorite performance was Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, whose character is infused with a sense of otherworldly wisdom as well as a deep sense of compassion.\n\nOverall, The Green Mile is a powerful film that explores themes of justice and empathy. I felt emotionally challenged at times but I find it to be a must-see for anyone who appreciates masterful storytelling and stunning performances.",

            "content": "An absolute must-watch, a movie which I cannot say enough good things about. The Green Mile is a gut-wrenching masterpiece with fantastic storytelling, this is one of the few movies which has made me cry real tears. From the get-go, we get a sense of how painful this movie will be, and the epistemic ambivalence of Michael Clarke Duncan's character is very compelling. This leaves the mystery of the two girls up to our imagination and keeps the, although quite long story, gripping. \n\nThis is one of the few movies that sticks to the book's storyline, although some parts are cut out like Delacroixs' backstory. However the storyline is tastefully cut which in my opinion strengthens the plot of the movie. For example, The only death row inmate whose backstory is explored is Wild Bills. I think that this makes the story even more compelling as in actuality throughout the movie we grow to like characters such as Delacroix and if Darabont decided to include his backstory we would lose the relationship that we have built with the character of Delacroix. This decision in turn vilified Wetmore as when we witness what he does to Delacroix, it cements him as the secondary antagonist of The Green Mile. \n\nWhilst I adore this movie, I do, however, think it very slightly undermines the story of The Green Mile. Although this movie is a drama/fantasy movie, we somewhat forget the fantastical nature of the movie as Coffey's powers become a normal occurrence in the movie. In the last 20 minutes of the movie, however, I get the sense that Darabont forgot about the fantasy side of the movie and tries to make u for it. I won't spoil the last 20 minutes but in my opinion, I think that the movie could've ended with Edgecomb crying as the emotional ending to Paul's story is still firmly in our minds and I feel that the last 20 minutes removes that gut-wrenching overtone of his story. \n\nAll in all, this is an amazing movie that i think all should watch. \nWell done Darabont.",

For sure, some will get turned off by the religious aspect - but I wonder if John Coffey is actually an angel (or whatever), or indeed, is it that although Stephen King's books often infer it's about religion, really he is talking about a higher power that presents itself to us using motifs we understand.",

The movie is very emotional and it just hits me harder than almost any other movie ever did. \nThe characters are great too and we both have one of the most evil and selfish characters ever in the guard Percy Wetmore, while we also have one of the kindest but also saddest characters ever in the prisoner John Coffey (\"Like the drink, only not spelled the same.\"). The other guards are trying to do their job as good as possible, while they can't go too much against Percy, since he has some high ranked personal connections but at the same time they want to be respectful to the prisoners on death row. \nThe acting is great and Doug Hutchison did a good job at making his character unlikeable and evil, while still showing small hints of insecurity. Michael Clarke Duncan also did a great job at playing the big and kind child killer, who is scared and innocent like a kid, who doesn't seem too belong on death row.\nThe movie is almost flawless and truly a masterpiece and it really makes you question if death penalty really is a good idea?",

My only complaint of The Green Mile is the length, I do think it is too long. However, The Green Mile is a film that is haunting, thought-provoking, moving and engrossing.\n\nThe film is beautifully directed by Frank Darabont(director of the slightly superior The Shawshank Redemption), is beautifully shot with a foreboding setting and atmospheric cinematography and lighting and has an engrossing and haunting story that is well-paced too. Thomas Newman's score is positively hypnotic and very beautiful, with some great authentic song choices, my favourite being Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams(And Dream Your Troubles Away).\n\nThe script is thoughtful too, and the movie also has a big emotional impact without feeling manipulative, I honestly couldn't help crying at the end of the movie. I have to say as well, the execution scenes were really quite harrowing. The performances are strong, Tom Hanks is excellent as the warden, as is Doug Hutchison who gives a credibility and complexity to a character that could have easily been clich\u00e9d and David Morse as Brutus. But Michael Clarke Duncan is the actor I want to give the real kudos to, he has a wonderful character and he absolutely nails it.\n\nOverall, a very, very good movie. Had it been shorter, it would have been perfect. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The entire film is very depressing, though the incredibly powerful and touching message and ending will leave many viewers thinking about this movie well after seeing it. The story and plot never shakes and it never becomes generic. The main antagonist is also one of my most hated characters in film history, not because the actor did not play him well, but in fact the opposite, where Hutchinson plays Percy absolutely flawlessly. Overall, one of the best Stephen King films to ever be adapted onto the big screen, and one of the most memorable films of all time that is sure to bring you back to watch it many times after.",

The music is incredibly emotional, epic and beautiful. I love the storytelling. It's very reminiscent of Shawshank Redemption, which should be no surprise since it's the same director lol. It's got a pretty genuine and sweet sense of humor. \n\nHoly shit man, John Coffey is fucking huge! Lol. He fucking looms, towers over everyone!! Oh this little Percy shit is gonna get it. God, what a repulsive, repugnant, disgusting, vile, hateful man. He's got tiny man so I gotta act like a big man syndrome. Aww, that little mouse was so cute. Funny how the mouse can come and go as he pleases, yet everyone in the prison, even the guards, are stuck inside. The symbology in this movie is on another level. The way they shaved the Native Americans head right before the electrocution reminded me a lot of how back in the Old West days they would scalp their enemies. Holy fuck! The insurmountable tension in the air right before he gets electrocuted. His heavy fearful breathing, the acute ringing of the electricity running throughout the chair. It's all brilliantly crafted. I'm telling you, the attention to detail in this movie is astounding. The use of audio and effects are impressive. \n\nOMG! John has the gift to heal! Incredible. He's like a giant baby angel sent down to Earth. Sam Rockwell's so devilishly crazy in this movie. Lmao! I love it. He really turned it up a notch for his character as the despicable Wild Bill. It's interesting. Percy represents the evil and cruelty that exists in this world. The evil that is willing and ready to stomp out any good that might come into the world. I'm glad Eduard died in the horrifically gruesome way that he did. Now all those people attending the electrocution will never want to witness another one again. Serves them right for thinking of it as some kind of entertainment. Amazing how John took the pain for Eduard while being electrocuted. That was insane how John kept the evil within him just so he could transfer it to Percy, so he could then carry out his deed of punishing Wild Bill for killing the two little girls. Oh the beautiful irony! Percy was gonna work at a mental institute as an administer but instead became the patient. Lmao! Well deserved. \n\nMasterful storytelling, brilliantly written. Phenomenally acted. I love Thomas Newman's playful yet emotionally epic tone for the soundtrack. Filled with brilliant imagery and symbology. It tackles it's serious and dark subject matter straightforward and to the point but also shows it's tender, lighter, sweeter, charming more humorous and heartfelt side as well. The characters in this movie have beautiful characteristics and qualities to them. Of course most, not all. It makes it very easy to like and admire them that much more. Definitely a tearjerker. I don't think I've teared up so much in my life while watching a movie. The most emotionally impactful and powerful movie I've ever seen. It ripped me apart. I had to pause the movie several times so I could blow my nose and wipe my face. A beautifully spiritual journey about the human experience and the human condition. Of what it means to be human. I thought of a really good quote because of this movie: \"What we do in this lifetime will reflect what happens in the next\". Also works as great commentary on how flawed our justice system is. Everything about this movie was amazing and beautifully touching! I loved it! This is one I'll be revisiting time and time again.",

Paul Edgecomb, the story narrator, he was prison warden at the time and he received in prison Jonh Coffey , a black and strong man, that has been arrasted on death row for the rape and murder of two little girls.

            "content": "Frank Darabont's \"The Green Mile\" is an intimate, heartwarming and profound prison drama that captures the friendships formed by prison guards in the 1930s. With his second feature, writer/director Frank Darabont crafted an astonishing adaptation of Stephen King's celebrated book that holds up today as a modern-day classic. Using captivating cinematography, Darabont draws viewers into the world of a death-row facility that is struck by supernatural events in the 1930s. From intimate close-ups to extraordinary establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's setting. Darabont showcases extraordinary control of craftsmanship over the production design, editing techniques and musical score, using these elements to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. Darabont's screenplay is also superb, and effectively employs a nonlinear flashback structure to tell the story from the perspective of an elderly  corrections officer. It is hard to not praise the phenomenal performances from the cast. Tom Hanks delivers one of the best performances of his career as Paul Edgecomb. With riveting expressions, he captures the angst, benevolence and righteousness of a good-natured prison guard that forms a friendship with an inmate. Michael Clarke Duncan is also marvelous in the role of a black prison guard with mysterious supernatural powers. In his one of his finest roles, Duncan imbues humanity into a warmhearted black prisoner that is wrongfully accused of a crime. The final, most notable standout in the cast is Doug Hutchison. As a malicious prison guard with evil intentions, he brings an air of menace to the movie. Although \"The Green Mile\" is undeniably an unforgettable prison drama, ultimately it is not a flawless film. If there's a minor drawback to the movie, it suffers from a lengthy running-time. At nearly three hours, it occasionally tests the viewer's patience. Nevertheless, fans of the beloved book will definitely enjoy \"The Green Mile\" and so will movie-goers seeking heartfelt entertainment. At a time when the death penalty continues to be exploited in the U.S. today, one only hopes that it will evoke empathy for wrongfully accused prisoners whose stories deserve to be seen and heard.",

I prefer to view responses from the actual viewing audience which is the movie's target in the first place. The cast that was selected for The Green Mile was spot on. Whether the character was tempered or outlandishly wild, the positions were filled with people that produced an impeccable delivery and emotion of the screenplay to the viewers. Whether Hanks, Duncan, Rockwell, Hutchinson, Morse, Jeter, Cromwell, or Sadler; they all contributed to staying in their lane of character personalities throughout the film. After Duncan had kept giving the line of 'I took it back', and you rewound in your mind to the beginning of the movie where he stated, 'I couldn't take it back', it was apparent that he never killed Sadler's girls. The surprise comes in later when one of the inmates reaches out and grabs Duncan's arm. Duncan says, \"You a bad man\".\nYes, it's a long movie, but if they kept cutting and leaving too much out of the film, I believe there would have been too many questions about 'why this', and 'why that'. The Green Mile is one of my top 20 movies of all time for obvious reasons. Although a bit dark and definitely sad in certain segments, it is highly uplifting to know that Stephen King was writing a novel about miracles, and how they might affect people in the most desperate levels of circumstances, as well as those around them that were not. It is, IMHO, one of the best concepts and sets of multiple types of finite results that has ever been assembled before.",

On the surface, it's the simple story of the relationship between prison guards and a prisoner who has been sentenced to death, perhaps unjustly. Subjectively speaking, the movie becomes eye-rollingly shameless and sentimental when it becomes a religious parable.  John Coffey symbolizes Jesus \u2013 they even share the same initials.  Coffey can cure the ill, give life to the dead, experience the pain of others, and a variety of other Jesus-like wonders.  Many who survive the bloated three-hour running time will find The Green Mile wildly inspirational.  The remainder of its audience will find it to be a manipulative and shallow mess that panders to the converted.",

The electric chair is anti-humane torture, a sinful crime against people rights. See how prisoners suffer against heartless guards and corrupt accusing at John Coffey in this movie. This also was during a time when their was less regard to sympathy and understanding. If this main character Paul Edgecomb is somehow a good man with a heart, he didn't rule break to stop Percy for the prisoners.

It was nominated for four Academy Rewards\n\nPlot in this film is the most memorable thing. It doesn`t really unpredictable, but it doesn`t typical. Here you won`t find any happy ending. Yes, it is sad. But it`s show that not all stories ends good. This ending is a feature of this film. Also, movie timing is really big, about three hours, but you don`t feel it. It isn`t annoying, and that`s impressive.\n\nJust for me it one of the best, if not the best movie I had watched. Maybe it`s not typical, but I love sad endings. Because they are more real, they are giving some food for thought and imagination. Characters are really interesting. Script was written amazing. And the idea of the film is also important. It shows us that you can`t help everyone, it shows that real life is cruel and dishonest. Also it makes us understand, that hasty conclusion is not always true.\n\nMy opinion that film is great. If you hate sad moments in films \u2013 please, don`t watch it. In all other ways you must do it. It isn`t a film about special effects, CGI and spectacular soundtrack.

As a film, it reflects that everyone is full of dark and light. Whether you are 95% evil like Percy of Wild Bill or 98% good as John Coffey, we all suffer under one impending reality--death. The use of the Green Mile, \"floored with linoleum the color of tired old limes...\", drops the audience into the world of the Great Depression and struggles of wrongful occasion based on color. With the fantasy elements to tie up the movie with a pretty bow despite the dark concept, the Green Mile is a realistic (aside from magic) movie that will tug your heartstrings through and through.",

            "content": "Viewed by most as the lesser Frank Darabont directed Stephen King adaptation, this three hour epic contains the unfortunate trope of a magical negro and really doesn't need to be as long as it is. The Best Picture nomination it received was seen as a safe choice in a year which produced new, imaginative films like Being John Malkovich (1999) and Magnolia (1999). Watching the film I could not help but feel the same way as with it's literary source material, cast headed by perennial favorite Tom Hanks and sense of self importance it is easy to see why lazier votes gravitated towards it. By the film's end I was so sick of the repetitive imagery and ideas that the film kept drumming into the audience that I was not emotionally moved as I was meant to be.\n\nPrisoner officer Paul Edgecomb, Tom Hanks, works in death row and has a close bond with fellow officer Brutus Howell, David Morse, and Warden Hal Moores, James Cromwell. When the giant African-American John Coffey, Michael Clarke Duncan, enters the prison Edgecomb finds it difficult to believe that he raped and murdered two young white girls due to his childish nature. The surly young Percy Wetmore, Doug Hutchison, has his position as an officer due to his familial connections to the local government and tortures the inmates for his own sadistic pleasure. Edgecomb discovers that Coffey has god given powers when he is able to heal a mouse and removes Edgecomb's urinary infection and eventually uses his abilities to remove a brain tumor from Moores's wife Melinda, Patricia Clarkson. After Edgecomb has a vision while holding hands with Coffey he realizes that he was framed for the murders and was trying to heal the two girls and another inmate at the prison is actually responsible for his crimes but Coffey is still killed.\n\nCoffey never once feels like a real character and more like a plot device contrived to wring tears out of the audience while allowing the filmmakers to pat themselves on their backs for the \u2018humanity' they display. We get so many shots of Duncan with his lips pouting and his face drenched in sweat while tears trickle down his face and the fact that the only character of color in the film has to essentially be a child is maddening. The scenes of him healing people or in one case putting the villain in a vegetative state are meant to be awe inspiring as this angel evens up the score set by an unjust god but they all feel false because we do not care for Coffey. The revelation that he has been sent by God to help restore humanity to the prison is hardly shocking considering how religious the film feels in it's final thirty minutes and as an atheist I did not care for these strong undertones.\n\nMuch like The Shawshank Redemption (1994) the film wastes an interesting opportunity to make us relate to a man who has committed a horrible crime and instead makes him a saint who has to endure undeserved punishment. I hoped in the first half of that film that we would discover that Andy Dufresne did brutally murder his wife as it would have made his rehabilitation and escape from prison all the more poignant as well as making viewers consider whether the prison system is effective. This film makes it's unfairly imprisoned man even less flawed than Dufresne and takes any personality that he could have had away from him. At least there was some righteous anger in the characters from the 1994 film but Coffey is willing to bend over and take whatever punishment is unfairly dealt to him and adores his white superiors. The whole film adopts this tone as the Christian values that the film tries to throw at you hit you in the face and it takes three hours to have all of these ideas reinforced over and over again.\n\nCromwell gives a solid supporting turn as the man struggling with his wife's illness but he appears infrequently in the film's three hour run time and is not enough to brighten up a dreary affair that does not have all that much to say.",

            "content": "A deep dive in human empathy.\n\nDirector Frank Darabont's fantasy drama The Green Mile (1999) is a breathtaking achievement combining cinematic beauty, relatable human experience, and brilliant character acting. Darabont brings Stephen King's novel to life as a testament to the power of understanding emotional distress and suffering. All human fear is captured within several death row prison guards and their inmates. We see men willing to either empathize with the pain of those around them or cause atrocious harm to others for their own sadistic intentions.\n\nThomas Newman's beautiful score creeps in for just the most emotional sequences to help build a sense of wonder. The grim lighting reaches its peak with one of cinema's most haunting shots as a man's life is taken during an execution and the frame is centered on Tom Hanks crying while the lights blow out in a triumphant showing of lighting, acting, writing, direction, and cinematography. Darabont achieves film excellence with what I consider his greatest film. That is saying something as he also directed The Shawshank Redemption. The Green Mile is just deeper, universal, and devastating throughout its massive run-time of endless emotional sequences.\n\nFurthermore, the fantasy aspect comes with Michael Clarke Duncan's poignant and moving performance as the simple-minded and big-hearted giant named John. Duncan's most touching acting is within his tender eyes, trembling voice, and soft movements in The Green Mile. He gets to portray a sensitive man that can take on the pain of others around him, relieving the agony of everyone he touches. Michael Clarke Duncan died too soon as I wish he got to do more dramatic roles like The Green Mile, but he gifted us with his astonishing display of the empathetic miracle man for The Green Mile.\n\nTom Hanks is perfect as the death row \"Green Mile\" guard boss Paul. His eyes and mouth exhibit a stunning amount of emotional force that is the key to The Green Mile's success. He's an everyman whom the audience can always relate to compared to the crazy inmates, kindly guards, cruel guards, corrupt officials, and fantasy sequences. Hanks finds an emotional center to his performance that rivals his work in Road to Perdition and Catch Me If You Can. Hanks is actually underappreciated for creating a genuine sense of sympathy and expressive faces.\n\nDavid Morse gives his greatest performance too as the hulking, yet considerate good guard Brutus. His name is ironic considering Brutus is loyal and kindly with a stern hand only for the wicked. Morse is a fantastic counterpart for Tom Hanks to act off of in most scenes. Similarly, Barry Pepper's sympathetic guard Dean is an emotional core for The Green Mile. He always does his job, while also considering his wards. I feel the same about the skeptical and nice Harry, played by the steadfast Jeffrey DeMunn. Bonnie Hunt is great as Hanks' caring and patient wife.\n\nJames Cromwell delivers a phenomenal performance as a grieving husband worn down by his wife's illness as well as a prison warden who is willing to overlook the rules for people with connections. Speaking of which, you love to hate Doug Hutchinson as the sadistic Percy. His sniveling, cruel, and brutal role represents all the thoughtless prison guards ever to abuse an inmate. He also persists as a classic example of nepotism, narcissism, toxic masculinity, cowardice, and hypocrisy. His thoughtful performance, on the other hand, is unforgettable as the loathsome Percy is forever ingrained in the viewer's mind as the man that stepped on a cute little mouse. On a similar note, Sam Rockwell gives a dark turn as the monstrous Wharton. His incessant teasing and grotesque actions make him one of cinema's sleaziest villains.\n\nMichael Jeter is a real tear jerker as the French Creole man Delacroix. His heavy accent is beyond impressive as he just assumes this very difficult character with such a specific accent. His tears bring the same to your eyes. He's a highly sympathetic character who gets arguably the most horrific end to anyone in any film. Likewise, Graham Greene gives a quiet, yet moving performance as the native man condemned to death named Arlen.\n\nPatricia Clarkson gets a beautiful role as the infected character Melinda. She is such a ray of sunshine and empathy. You can just tell how warm Clarkson is by her portrayal. Harry Dean Stanton gets a hilarious role as the insane janitor and electric chair rehearsal subject Toot Toot. You will love Gary Sinise's cameo role as Burt. His monologue about the potential evil in some men is haunting and captivating thanks to Sinise's sincere depiction.\n\nIn all, The Green Mile is simply a feast for fantastic acting expressive and empathetic alike. Darabont's direction is dazzling and grips you the entire duration. It never overstays its welcome thanks to its heartfelt message and poignant performances.",

As a huge fan of Stephen King, I was skeptical of his work coming to the big screen, but huge props to director Frank Darabont. I loved how he told the story; the pace is perfect, the tone is light at times but not afraid to get dark and horrific as to the real horrors of death row in the 1930s. I immediately connected with the characters. Tom Hanks is his usual great self as Supervisor prison guard Paul Edgecombe, but the real star is the late Michael Clarke Duncan as the gentle giant inmate John Coffey who is on death row for a crime he did not commit. The execution scene at the end will have you crying your heart out. I cannot say how important it is to watch this movie at least once.

The film is directed by Frank Darabont who is the same man that directed the Shawshank Redemption. The film stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb and Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey.\n\nThe acting is really strong from Tom Hanks to Sam Rockwell as Wild Bill. I especially liked Michael Clarke Duncan\nI felt that he gave John Coffey's charcter a great portrayal.\n\nThe characters in my opinion are great especially John Coffey who has now become one of my favourite fictional characters of all time. The characters range from extremely nice like John Coffey to extremely evil like Wild Bill.\n\nThe cinematography is very strong and fits with the style of the film. The film also has some really good shots.\n\nI personally really like the settings from the era to the green mile. The green mile is a really good setting mostly because it keeps the characters confined and on their feet.\n\nThe set design and props are very steady from the building designs to the batons. \n\nThe costume design fits perfectly with the era and fits the characters really well.\n\nThe film in my opinion also has a really good style from the colour scheme to the pacing.\n\nThe practical effects are done very well from the mouse to making John Coffey bigger then he really is.\n\nThe special effects are also done very well from the light to the insects, and still hold up to today. \n\nThe action in my opinion is really strong from the direction to the tension. The film also has one of my personal favourite action scenes of all time.\n\nThe music also fits the film very well and has a calm but tense feel to it.\n\nThe story may be long but in my opinion it is really good and gripping especially with the characters pulling it along. \n\nThe film also has some very strong comedy especially from the character Wild Bill.\n\nThe film has some really strong atmospheric moments especially toward the end.\n\nThe film is also extremely emotional and something that will make me cry every time.\n\nThe film may have a 3h 9m runtime, but in my personal opinion it flys by and is really enjoyable to watch.\n\nThe film does have a couple things wrong, but in the grand scheme of things it barely takes away from the experience.\n\nOver all I give it a 9/10 - one of the greats",

The movie is written by Frank Darabont who also participated in the directing of the great movie. The main starring individuals in the movie include Tom Hanks who plays the part of Paul Edgecomb and works as a supervisor at Cold Mountain Penitentiary.

There are various supporting characters in the movie who both enable the movie to portray the themes that are significant in the development of The Green Mile Movie. The storyline of this movie analyzes the life of a prison supervisor who is in charge of the death row and some supernatural events that he witnessed during his time as the death sentence supervisor. The story is narrated in a flashback form of Paul recalling the events that happened in the Penitentiary during his time as a prison warden.\n\n The Green Mile film is associated with positive reviews and feedback from the various audiences that watched the movie. The positive feedback and reception of this movie can be portrayed by the various awards that the actors of the movie won during the year 1999. The movie also won the best picture Academy Award while Michael Clark won an award for the best-supporting-actor during the same year. Other awards associated with the Green Mile film include the best-adapted-screenplay award and best sound mixing awards which all portray a positive reception of the Green Mile film. The primary themes that are revealed from watching the Green Mile film include the effects of health punishment in the society and the control of punishment approaches in the community. \n\n\n\nCriminal Punishment Administration\n\nThe work of criminal punishment administration is the role and function of the penitentiary in the United States of America. The government of a country is responsible for ensuring that the laws of the country are strictly followed by every member of the society. The government also ensures that individuals in a country live in peace and Harmony and those who violate the laws of the country are punished according to the nature of the crime they have committed. \n\n\n\nin conclusion, the film The Green Mile was an interesting movie that also enlightened me concerning the role of the judicial system and some of issues and concerns that affected the judicial system in the United States of America during the 1930s. Some of these issues included racial discrimination aspects in the judicial system, lack of equal rights and Justice between the wardens and the criminals and the impacts of negative social relations in the society. The movie was therefore significant because it clearly portrayed some of the significant issues that affect the relations of individuals in the society. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBedau, H. A.

About how most of the inmates live life on the inside and the truth behind the jail cells but not all get along, obey and bond with the guards. The Green Mile shows how an innocent man can easily be put in jail for a crime that he didn't have any part of. The tone of the movie I think would be serious but also emotional at times. A quote in the movie that I particularly like is made by Paul Edgecomb it says \"Time takes it all, whether you want it to or not. Time takes it all, bears it away, and in the end there is darkness. Sometimes we find others in that darkness, and sometimes we lose them there again.\" This to me shows how in time we can find ourselves or we can lose ourselves in our own minds. The most serious part of the movie to me is when the guard Percy Wetmore gets to finally perform one of the executions in the electric chair. This was the most dramatic execution that happened. After the execution guard Percy was forced by guard Paul to resign from his job and leave prison.",

The movie should\u2019ve either focused on the story of John Coffee OR just the complicated stories of the other inmates.

Also, I started to get confused when the story went back to the older Paul and he showed the lady the mouse and apparently that they both are indefinitely immortal. It was difficult to understand and seemed unneeded, similar to a lot of things in this movie (for example, the excessive amount of scenes of Paul and his urinary infection). Don\u2019t get me wrong, the picture, acting and writing was amazing. The level of suffering that was shown in the electric chair scene with the mouse guy was enough to make me start crying, and most of the main actors gave a nearly flawless performance.

Part of me wishes it had stayed as a normal drama, but another part of me has to admit that the story suddenly became a lot more interesting. Frank Darabont, who of course met massive success with his masterpiece 'The Shawshank Redemption', returns with a very different film. This is, in many ways, more of a fantasy horror than a prison drama. Darabont was clearly intent on making a much more symbolic film this time around, and with allegories of God and Saints, as well as a deeper meaning concerning the morality and fate of good and evil, 'The Green Mile' is certainly an interesting thought-piece. There is a sense sometimes that the supernatural element doesn't always work quite as well as maybe intended, but the characters and the craft from Darabont mean that this film is too well-made and expertly crafted not to be seen.",

Not just that, but one who speaks in a ridiculous Sambo speech pattern (I's never done seen a picture show, boss).\nWe also once again get maybe the worst Stephen King trope of them all: a prisoner falsely accused, somehow ends up getting interned alongside the person who really committed the murder, and some contrivance allows them to actually find that out somehow. Compare that to the approach of something like Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri (also a Sam Rockwell film, though he's overacting so much less there) and its \"no easy answers\" narrative, you can see why this one just comes off like...shlock.",

For one, the framing sequence doesn\u2019t work all that well and adds almost nothing to it. There\u2019s a small kernel of a good idea in there but it doesn\u2019t come together as a full concept. Also there are a couple of things that the guards do in the movie that are so insane and dumb that it stretches logic to it\u2019s breaking point. That being said, I don\u2019t care all that much.

When it comes, the climax of Percy's sadism is shocking and brutal.\n\nAfter this emotional gut punch, the film becomes slightly more tame, with the second half focusing mainly on the healing power of John Coffey. Coffey's character has been criticized as being of a 'magic negro' stereotype-  a black character whose purpose in life is to solve a problem for or further the happiness of a white person. But Coffey's character exists partly to challenge the racism of the depression-era Louisiana setting- his pure innocence and benevolence in the face of a murder conviction confounds the expectations of those such as his lawyer, who's comparison of him to a vicious dog is the most obvious example of racism in the film.\n\nStill, Coffey's innocence presents a problem. He becomes an almost messianical figure, a saviour who exists to take away other's pain but is never believably human. This is a shame, as he has some morally dubious points, such as when he uses his power to use Percy to kill 'Wild Bill' Wharton, in the process committing Percy to a mental institution. This is justified in the film as Wharton is a mass murderer and Percy is an abusive guard. But by failing to question Coffey's right to condemn those 'bad people' to death, the film misses and opportunity to reflect on the legal system's right to do the same. \n\nThe film is bookended by an unnecessary, sentimental flashback intro and outro, which drags it out to over three hours. Still, in the main body of the film various injustices are not resolved so neatly. These include the lack of proper retribution for Percy's torture of 'Del'. for Coffey's indirect murder of Wharton and institutionalisation of Percy, the lack of recognition of Coffey as innocent, and Wharton as guilty of the murder of the two young girls, not to mention the injustice of a system that executes it's criminals and subjects them to psychological torture as they wait on death row for their turn to walk the 'mile'. The 'Green Mile' could be a morally complex and challenging film about abuse of power and the right of authority to judge and execute. It is, but it loses some of it's potency in the overly sanctimonious portrayal of John Coffee.",

Paul and 2 other guards who look after Green Mile and the prisoners are unexpectedly surprised of Johns kind and well mannered behavior. Paul is having trouble believing that Coffey committed such a crime, Which also makes it hard for him and the other guards to believe they can carry out coffey's sentence. Some of the strengths of the movie is the exception and responsibility of his sentence even how unfair it is, the actors are very great and play their role perfectly, even the bad guys in the movie. There was only one weakness that Green mile had which was the Length, it was a 3 hour movie. So sit on the couch, and eat some popcorn, and enjoy one of the most longest but greatest movie ever made, this uplifting story filled with mystery, sadness, and some brilliant acting.",

The movie starts out with a group of men running with shotguns in their hands. This scene is captivating but not extremely captivating. For a movie that has a running time of three hours and eight minutes, it would be expected that there are quite some scenes that are boring; but \"The Green Mile\" is very entertaining. The movie's climax is a very sad scene but it's not's too sad. The plot to this movie is amazing. The plot would've been better except the characters were very likeable but then they'd do something that would make their character less likeable. \"Tom Hanks\" is an incredible actor in every role that he portrays. \"Thomas Newman\" the composer for the music in \"The Green Mile\" is stunning; \"Thomas Newman\" did a marvellous job at capturing the sadness in the movie. The filming of this movie is beautiful, \"Frank Darabont\" films shoots scenes perfectly. \"The Green Mile\" could've easily been a sad and ridiculous movie but instead it is a heart-warming drama movie.

There are qualities of his other non-horror stories in here such as The Mist and Dreamcatcher. But this film nails it. But it has nothing to do with it not being horror.  Horror doesn't mean it's going to be a bad film. But this film is just so good, so poignant, so perfect, and yet so different to make itself stand out from others. \n\nThis film seems like it's the first Steven King film to have fairly known actors. The lead role is taken by Tom Hanks who was placed in phenomenal roles in the '90s. This was most likely his final film of the decade, and it may be his best one yet. This film is so touching and heartful, with a dash of the crazy supernatural that Steven King is well known for and pretty much has to have in every film. \n\nI'm just speechless after watching this film. One of the greatest films of all time. A must own. So good. It's a crazy 3 hours, which is basically more than double the length of the average film, but it doesn't even matter. The film is spectacular from start to finish. This film is literally a masterpiece. The film immerses you and makes you empathize of what it is like to walk the green mile.",

Michael Clarke Duncan is perfect for the role of John Coffey and should've gotten the Oscar for best supporting actor in 1999. Tom Hanks is great in the role of Paul Edgecomb. The rest of the cast is great with supporting roles being played by Barry Pepper, David Morse, Michael Jeter, Jeffrey Demunn, Sam Rockwell, Harry Dean Stanton, James Cromwell, William Sadler, and the always villainous Doug Hutchison.

Comparing the two demeans the qualities The Green Mile has to offer, though. Darabont's \"other\" prison movie is moving, absorbing and carries its three-hour run time with aplomb. Darabont's level-headed directing and Steven King's fervent source material uncannily dissolves the world around you as you deal with the existence of God, and test your faith in humanity. While it doesn't cram religion down your throat, it acknowledges and explores the fact that there is magic in the world we will never know, with a brilliant Michael Clarke Duncan as the catalyst. It does include one of the more disturbing execution scenes in cinema history too, so tread lightly",

I guess I'll start by saying everything that is right with this film. The acting is great and the storyline is entertaining. It is easy to follow and straight forward. The symbolism is also outstanding. It is clear that John Coffey represents Jesus Christ with his healing abilities and his kind heart. He is sitting on death row for a crime that he did not commit. He is okay with it and ready to die just like Jesus Christ. All this seems like a perfect film but all this symbolism and plot development takes place in the second half of the film. The first half is good don't get me wrong but it doesn't mean anything. The second half makes it seem like the film is about John Coffey and everything he does and is sacrificing. The first half on the other hand focuses more on Tom Hanks and other things that are going on around the prison. The film just seems like it doesn't have a clear goal or any progression in the first half. Nonetheless this movie is good and definitely worth seeing.",

Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan are the most visible, and work an easy connection with the cameras in two deeply sympathetic roles, but Sam Rockwell also hands in a terrific part as a give-no-damns lunatic whose wild, vicious, unhinged attitude works in strong contrast to his cellmates' general resignation.

Yes, they both focus on a man wrongfully accused by the court of law, and give an insight to life and death behind iron bars, but beyond that, they both tell two, brilliant, stories.\n\nThis particular film sees Tom Hanks star as a Depression era prison guard in a death row prison complex, who is confronted when an inmate is brought to the prison who shows a remarkable ability to heal others. This role is brought to life incredibly well by Michael Clarke Duncan, and was probably deserving of an Oscar (with all due respect to Michael Caine).\n\nTaking a story that deals with the unfairness of life, and the finality of death, is no easy task, and there's no happy ending for Duncan's character, as with Andy DuFresne in Shawshank. But with a moving screenplay and brilliant supporting acts from the likes of David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, Sam Rockwell, James Cromwell, Patricia Clarkson, Harry Dean Stanton and Gary Sinise, amongst others, this movie becomes a delight to watch, with it's 3 hour runtime pouring out the door along with all of your tears.\n\nAn incredibly moving experience. 5 stars.",

The story has an amazing path, it's ups and downs make it feel like a three hour version of life.\nThis film has the ability to suck you in until the credits roll. You'll be stuck in your seat for the longest time, just staring at the screen in awe of the masterpiece you are watching.\nEach character has their own personality. You know who to love, you know who to hate, and you know who to be decisive with.\nTo this day, no one, not even author Stephen King or director Frank Darabont knows what the story means. And we like it that way. No one knows the meaning of life, either. And because of that, in a sense, this movie IS life.\nAnd it certainly is a masterpiece, right up their with Citizen Kane and The Godfather.",

I think this is the most part of how bound of a man and an animal can be so strong, even he knew that death is upon him. For the plot complexity, it's not long, it's not filled by many mind-twisting or such, but it is still a great movie.\n\nFor the minus, I could say there is nothing. I feel I am inspired. Nice movie, when you think the way it was in 1935.\n\nAnd, come on. The duration is not that long if you enjoyed it. It was necessary, and not exaggerated. I am not exaggerating, too. \n\nIf you want some feels, get this movie. If you like complex crime story, and not 3 hours long, don't watch this. Heck, how can people expecting crime complexity from this?",

The death of John Coffey truly is heartbreaking when you think of how much he just wanted to help others that already love each other. Not only that, it reveals what kind of people we are to destroy such love e.g. Will Bill, as he kills two girls that love each other, and Percy Wetmore, who attempts to kill both Del and Mr.Jingle.

The film centres on Death Row at the Cold Mountain Correctional Facility, something known as 'the green mile' due to the dark green floor. Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the head guard on the Green Mile when the towering new inmate John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), convicted of murdering two young girls, is brought into custody. Despite his huge figure and supposed horrific crimes, Coffey seems to be of a more gentle nature, resembling that of a child, not a child killer. After some time Edgecomb starts to notice miraculous things coming from Coffey's cell, leading to questions surrounding whether Coffey would be capable of the terrible things to which he has been convicted.\n\nFrank Darabont definitely doesn't rush this film, which clocks in at three hours long. It feels a lot more like watching a TV series in one big hit, which is not necessarily a bad thing, it just means that patience and stamina is needed. Although very long, Darabont delivers precision in his direction. Darabont manages to immerse the audience in the death row setting, using the flashback device to ease into the story. Plenty going on during the film which flows very well.\n\nThe acting throughout this film is overall very solid with Tom Hanks leading the way, allowing the film to flow in the way it does; keeping the audience listening which is definitely needed due to the length of the movie. Michael Clarke Duncan perfectly portrays the friendly giant John Coffey, successfully giving off a  combination of innocence and intimidation. Furthermore, the supporting cast, which includes Barry Pepper, David Morse and James Cromwell, are also on good form.\n\nA top film that will definitely not disappoint, providing you can stick it out.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n7/10.",

Anyway, the story is about an old Paul Edgecomb who is crying whilst watching the film Top Hat. Because of this, he tells his wife his flashback storyline. So now the film takes place during The Great Depression and a 44-year-old Paul played by Tom Hanks is the head guard of the prison and The Green Mile which is what prison inmates call it because of the dark green linoleum that tiles the floor. Soon they get a new inmate named John Coffey played my Michael Clarke Duncan (may he rest in peace) is brought in soon to be executed for the case of murdering two girls. John seems like a nice, kind and well-mannered person who behaves less like a hardened criminal but two of Paul's fellow guards named Howell and Stanton played by David Morse and Barry Pepper notice something odd about John. He is able to perform miracles of healing on his fellow inmates, leading them to what sort of person he could be, and John also shows Paul about what really happened with the girls. Tom Hanks was great in the lead role. Stephen King said that he envisioned Hanks as Paul in his story and that's a good reason why he deserved to be casted. Michael Clarke Duncan was even better as John. It's amazing how a common Oscar buzz gets out-acted by a lesser-known actor who unfortunately had a small career with just over a decade and died afterwards. Now while I do like this movie, why am I complaining? Because it's so dull and drags for so long. People say that The Mist was a lower bar to this and I'm saying no. This was a lower bar to The Mist. People also say that the reason why it drags for so long is all to do with build-up. Well if that's the case, either make it short or don't do the build up at all. Is it good? I don't think so. Is it above average? Definitely yes! Does it deserve its Oscar nominations? Of course. Can I watch it again? Maybe. Do I think it deserved to be a better film in the end? Yes it did. The Green Mile gets a 7.5/10.",

The \"Shawshank Redemption\" director took a more emotional approach in a prison film with the \"Forrest Gump\" actor telling the story that wows us. (A-)\n\n(Full review coming soon)\n\nNow back to the part about the 3-hour long story being a small focus of criticism. It doesn't matter how long a story is. What matters is what the story is and how you gotten yourself to hear it so the story can be told and fulfills its purpose of existence. There's no rush of telling a long story, unless it started to get a slow pace and brought its listeners out to boredom and losing interest. If that ever happens, it means the story wants to stop. Some stories may not be serious ones, but they can be enough to be enjoyable for the taste. So there's no reason for criticizing a length of a story unless the story isn't a worthy one because of its length and little offerings to the taste and interest.\n\nIf there were any stories that were long and were criticized for that and the story was enjoyable, I say those stories should be reevaluated. If that criticism was backed-up with points on why the story's not enjoyable enough to justify its length, then that thought can stay the same. If any critics of any kind in areas that circulates on this, keep these words in mind if you like and see if these words change anything to your opinions on some stories. These words are just my opinion in a form of a theory as we all have different thoughts/opinions and theories.",

While Mr. King certainly has his scary moments, I think to call his merely a horror writer would be selling him quite short. No film director seems better suited to prove this point to the world of moviegoers than Frank Darabont. He touched the hearts of millions with his brilliant adaptation of King's The Shawshank Redemption, and a few years later he did it again with The Green Mile, a story about life for a handful of individuals in a down south prison during the early twentieth century.\n     Changed forever by the arrival of a mysterious and intimidating prisoner who is much more than he seems, these men will experience love, childlike compassion, and death all on the same physical space. They work on death row, and execution is their common practice. Mystery and magic are woven brilliantly throughout this otherwise-authentic telling of life in the south, and if one is willing to take the plunge, The Green Mile soon becomes one of the most heart-wrenching and simultaneously heartwarming filmgoing experiences you're likely to have.",

            "content": "Completely moving.\n\nFrank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption) directs his second film and second Stephen King adaptation with The Green Mile. The film centres on Death Row at the Cold Mountain Correctional Facility, something known as 'the green mile' due to the dark green floor. Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the head guard on the Green Mile when the towering new inmate John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), convicted of murdering two young girls, is brought into custody. Despite his huge figure and supposed horrific crimes, Coffey seems to be of a more gentle nature, resembling that of a child, not a child killer. After some time Edgecomb starts to notice miraculous things coming from Coffey's cell, leading to questions surrounding whether Coffey would be capable of the terrible things to which he has been convicted.\n\nFrank Darabont definitely doesn't rush this film, which clocks in at three hours long. It feels a lot more like watching a TV series in one big hit, which is not necessarily a bad thing, it just means that patience and stamina is needed. Although very long, Darabont delivers precision in his direction. Darabont manages to immerse the audience in the death row setting, using the flashback device to ease into the story. Plenty going on during the film which flows very well.\n\nThe acting throughout this film is overall very solid with Tom Hanks leading the way, allowing the film to flow in the way it does; keeping the audience listening which is definitely needed due to the length of the movie. Michael Clarke Duncan perfectly portrays the friendly giant John Coffey, successfully giving off a  combination of innocence and intimidation. Furthermore, the supporting cast, which includes Barry Pepper, David Morse and James Cromwell, are also on good form.\n\nA top film that will definitely not disappoint, providing you can stick it out.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n7/10.",

After seeing a few I thought it looked interesting so I sat down to watch it one day. I remember it was me, a 16-year-old guy, sitting there alone in my living room completely engrossed in this film. As every minute of the film passed I grew to like it even more. This film isn't flashy or action packed or any of those other characteristics that appeal to the ignorant masses; what it had was beautiful music and beautiful character development and an expertly told, heart-wrenching story that left my tear-ducts so overworked it was painful. My parents were out at dinner as I was watching this movie for the first time and I remember they got home with about half an hour left in the film and my mom decided to come in and watch the ending of it with me. She had already seen it but obviously this was the first time I had seen it. It got to the point where I situated myself on the sofa to shield my face which was already streaked with tears from my mom. However we both glanced at each other at the same time and both of us just started openly crying like babies. A decent amount of films have made me tear up before, but very few actually work my emotions so hard that my bottom lip starts trembling and my nose starts running. It was such a great cry though, not many films captivate me so much that they get me crying like I did at the end of this film. That, in itself, is a testament to the power of this excellent movie. Anytime I need a good cry I'll be reaching for this movie again and again.",

Hanks, with the notable exception of the Da Vinci Code, is a powerhouse as the man in a crisis.  He plays Paul Edgecomb, a sensitive head guard on death row in a 1935 Southern US prison.  Director Darabont deftly handles the blend of supernatural with the natural, much as M Night Shyamalan did in The Sixth Sense.  Darabont keeps the viewer's feet firmly rooted in the natural and the believable, which is the secret to the success of the movie, I think.  I am afraid that I first saw Doug Hutchison play Eugene Victor Tooms in the X Files, and rejoiced at seeing him again, in a role that complements his looks perfectly.  Barry Pepper and David Morse play fine supporting roles to Hank, and hats off to Michael Clarke Duncan for stealing the show with his portrayal of the unusually gifted John Coffey, as in the drink, but spelled differently.",

No doubt the film is long, but it is needed to let the characters sit well within the audience's heart, making them love and care for the characters on-screen before the tragic ending. A perfect recipe for a tear-jerking ending. Michael Clarke Duncan (may he rest in peace) was darling in this film. Tom Hanks, Barry Pepper and the others were great too. Thomas Newman's subtle score was very heartfelt and warm, and potentially tear-jerking in parts as well. This and 'The Shawshank Redemption' are two of the three best Stephen King film adaptation, thanks to Frank Darabont, the other being 'Misery'. And Stephen King is one of my favourite writers in the world. Overall, a great film.",
