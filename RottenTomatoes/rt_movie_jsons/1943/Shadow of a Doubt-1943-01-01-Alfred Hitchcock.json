    "summary": "Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) visits his relatives in Santa Rosa. He is a very charming man, but his niece slowly realizes that he is wanted for murder and he soon recognizes her suspicions. Although one of the suspected murderers is killed and the case is considered closed, she still has her suspicions.",

            "content": "If one allows for an interpretation of this tale: This is a story rich in morals.\nOne, is that the truth must out- no matter the feelings or reactions of others: By considering her mothers emotions and close attachment to the character of Charlie senior, Charlie (junior), put her own life at risk. As authentic as she remained to the change in her feelings toward her uncle, she still did not take her authentic intuition to its rightful conclusion, and this may have cost her her life, yet again.\nOne could think of a parallel in real life, as so often happens in the case of childhood abuse. Where the uncle abuses the sweet, innocent and trusting niece, and instead of reporting the incident, the child would keep the news of her abuse to herself for fear of ruining the image of the \"happy, normal family.\" The motif of the \"normal happy family\" was played out most strongly by the mother (sister of Charlie senior)..another case where the mother remains clueless as to what is really going down in her very own household, and blinded by her admiration for her mysterious brother (she does not even know what his real occupation is)- she overrides her own instincts. Or something like that. This interpretation is my own and one does not need any interpretation to simply enjoy this early Hitchcock thriller, filled with tension, dark foreboding and excellent performances by both Charlies.",

It's a wonderfully dark tale about murder, how evil lives next door and the naivety and complacency of the human race.\n\nCotten is ably supported by the fabulous Teresa Wright. The duality and curious nature of their characters' relationship never fails to entrance me every time I watch this film. \n\nI cannot recommend this enough. As one film critic says \"if you don't know Shadow of a Doubt you don't know him (Hitchcock) actually\". I would say alongside Rear Window and North By Northwest it is one of his most Hitchcockian films.\n\nIn all of Hitchcock's works I would only rate Vertigo and Rear Window above Shadow of a Doubt and it's one that deserves to be higher on the list of his best ever films.",

The movie starts and continues great with a good mix of humor and suspense. But, once the reveal is made, it kind of goes down hill from there, even getting a little preposterous at times.

If it's the latter, Shadow of a Doubt may be the definitive film in the director's portfolio for you. It's a suspenseful crawl as the audience realizes the extent of the adversary's maliciousness (whose insidious nature is hinted at, but not explicitly confirmed until further in the film), and the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the unsuspecting family as Wright's Charlie recognizes their plight and must contend with it despite the disbelief of those around her. Personally, I think that other films by the master outstrip this one in terms of quality, and thus can't agree that Shadow of a Doubt is his greatest accomplishment, but recognize the quality, style, and complete nature of the film.

But in detail, it is actually a complex melodrama that deals with morality and that conveys a very cynical view about society. Hitchcock begins the story by showing us a pathetic American family in an irrelevant town in California. But as the story develops, we understand better the characters as well as Hitchcock's objective. This movie is about 78 years old, but it is amazing how the tension moments still hold up thanks to Cotten's and Wright's performances, and also to the fantastic camerawork. We can realize that the girl is actually in love with her uncle. And all of a sudden, her dream-like life in a peaceful town becomes a nightmare. Young Charlie's love for her uncle turns into hate. And to keep a \"clean image\" of a murderer, she must also keep the appearences by dealing with a deep love feeling and a moral conflict. This is a very contemporary critic about society, so relevant today as it was then. Arguably one of Hitch's best features despite Macdonald Carey's performance which I find kind of flat.",

            "content": "An early shining example of Alfred Hitchcock's directorial genius!\n\nAlfred Hitchcock's suspense thriller Shadow of a Doubt (1943) is a visceral and frightening depiction of a mass murderer on the run. Hitchcock draws out your fear for this small California town family's safety as they attempt to survive Uncle Charlie, who they do not even know is a serial killer. Hitchcock uses his signature long panning shots of stairs, doors, streets, as well as close-ups on faces for maximum effectiveness. Hitchcock simply understands what we are afraid of and exploits it in Shadow of a Doubt for tense encounters between a killer uncle and his astute niece.\n\nThe black and white cinematography is lush with beauty. From waltzers spinning in circles to a dutch angle shot of the unnerved killer fearing his capture and many more clever shots. I adore Joseph A. Valentine's cinematography in the library as young Charlie reads the newspaper clipping that reveals the plot. As young Charlie discovers who her uncle is the camera smoothly zooms out to a high aerial shot indoors with dark moody lighting for a haunting reveal. Shadow of a Doubt is full of neat and expressive shots.\n\nDimitri Tiomkin's score is scary as it swells for the dramatic sequences and carries you away with lovely passages for the sweeter moments. Tiomkin finds serenity in the quiet family moments and builds a crescendo of fear during the climactic sequences. I love Shadow of a Doubt's music.\n\nI adore Teresa Wright as young Charlotte \"Charlie\" Newton. She is so astute, nearing on clairvoyant, which gives her character a maturity and wisdom beyond her years. She is a subtle hero of her tough circumstances. Wright plays Charlie with a fierce determination and willful certainty. Teresa Wright acts pound for pound alongside Joseph Cotton at the heights of his acting prowess in a magnificent display as an actress.\n\nJoseph Cotton demonstrates his range in Shadow of a Doubt as the widow murderer Charles \"Uncle Charlie\" Oakley. Cotton sheds his nice guy persona from all his other classic films like Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, or The Third Man. Cotton's warm demeanor and delightful voice are nowhere to be found in Shadow of a Doubt as he opts to play Charlie as a cold deadpan killer with a silent menace and an obvious distaste for humanity. Cotton's hyper focused and highly nuanced villain is one for the ages. His constant pleasant attitude towards his family is so under-handed as he reveals his inner rage to his unsuspecting niece. It's honestly shocking every time I witness Joseph Cotton's transformation from the calm voice of reason to the monotone monster at the center of Shadow of a Doubt. Joseph Cotton is surely one of cinema's greatest antagonists in Shadow of a Doubt.\n\nHenry Travers is splendid as Joseph Newton, the kindly father to young Charlie, with his funny obsession with murder mysteries alongside his quaint friend Hume Cronyn as Herbie. They give a lot of much appreciated comedy relief from the super tense sequences within Shadow of a Doubt.\n\nLikewise, Patricia Collinge is devastating as Charlie's tired and lonely mother Emma Newton. Her desperation for her younger brother Uncle Charlie to stay with her is really saddening and upsetting. On the other hand, Edna May Wonacott is hilarious and endearing as Ann Newton. Her bright remarks are always a fun reprieve to the suspense in Shadow of a Doubt. Similarly, Charles Bates is a charming young son Roger Newton.\n\nOverall, Shadow of a Doubt elevates Hitchcock's masterful direction with all time great performances. I cannot recommend Shadow of a Doubt enough!",

He lives in Philadelphia and is a bit of a legend in the family, being a wealthy, self-made man.  His niece, also named Charlie, is particularly fond of him.  However, when he arrives, Uncle Charlie starts to act suspiciously.  Soon two surveyors appear at the house and start to ask questions about Uncle Charlie.  (Niece) Charlie starts to investigate and discovers that the two men are detectives and Uncle Charlie is a suspect in a nationwide manhunt and murder investigation.  However, the closer she gets to the truth, the more her own life is potentially in danger.\n\nA reasonably intriguing Alfred Hitchcock crime drama.  In typical Hitchcock fashion it unfolds slowly and deliberately, incrementally revealing just enough to keep you watching, while building up to a tense climax.\n\nNot among Hitchcock's best though.  The build-up is perhaps too slow here.  In addition, despite the title, there is not really that much doubt about whether Uncle Charlie is involved in the crimes, so the possibilities with regard to the outcome are limited.  The conclusion thus feels a touch inevitable, though there are a few other ways it could have gone (however, none of these would have been as exciting or complete).",

Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) is on the run from the law on the East Coast, and he settles in with his sister and her family in Santa Rosa.  Trouble is just behind him though, and it gets worse when his niece (also 'Charlie', named after him, and played by Teresa Wright) begins to suspect him of being the \"Merry Widow Murderer\".  \n\nI considered a slightly higher rating, but thought the pace in the first half of the movie was a little slow.  Some of the tension is also missing because we're pretty darn sure Uncle Charlie is guilty.  On the other hand, there is a real small town feeling to this setting, helped in no doubt by Thornton Wilder being one of the screenwriters, and the characters of Charlie's father (Henry Travers) and his friend (Hume Cronyn) passing the time by talking about the perfect murder are absolutely priceless.  The second half, including the increasing revelation of Uncle Charlie's dark views of humanity and the lengths to which he will go to protect himself, is what make the film so sinister.   As the movie came out during WWII, it seems to have a direct parallel to the evil leaders loose in the world, particularly in the film's final scene.",

Finally.\n\nI tend to be wary when I watch old movies, maybe just because I always expect something like Citizen Kane: apparently extremely well-regarded, but ultimately a little boring. I figured it'd be different with this movie, since it's Hitchcock, who always makes thrilling movies, but I still had my concerns. But I was totally held the whole way through.\n\nThis movie isn't a thriller in the same way that a lot of modern-day thrillers are. There wasn't any explicit violence until the last few scenes, and even then, it was pretty tame. Still, though, it's suspenseful, because you don't know exactly what Uncle Charlie's secret is, and even though you can kind of assume it's murder, it's tense knowing that he has a secret and younger Charlie doesn't know.\n\nIt's a really interesting dynamic between the two. The movie starts with young Charlie's devotion to him almost a little too much - there's some uncomfortable sexual tension between them - but that makes it even sadder when Charlie slowly begins to realize the rumors about her uncle are correct, and her expressions of idolatry slowly turn to confusion, anxiety, and a subtle somberness. Teresa Wright is such a bubbly, sunny presence as Charlie, and Joseph Cotten is good at the kind of charming and charismatic yet secretive and deeply contemptuous character. That scene where he described how rich women deserved to die was pretty tense, and as the movie went on, I couldn't believe how evil he became, especially considering I thought the movie was going to feature him more as an antihero. But when Uncle Charlie started actually making attempts on Charlie's life, I was shocked.\n\nThere were a couple silly things, mostly having to do with Jack Graham, the detective. The timing is kind of awkward in one scene, with Charlie suddenly yelling, \"You're a detective, aren't you?\" or whatever before the transition had even finished, with little to no buildup. Also, when Graham said he loved her, it was a little unbelievable considering they only had one date, basically. Everyone at my screening laughed a little when he said that. To the movie's credit, though, Charlie actually rejected him, which I wasn't expecting as much. There's no real 'happily ever after' for Charlie and Jack, though we don't know what happens after the events of the movie.\n\nBesides, there were a lot of really nice touches that made up for any small grievances I had. There were a lot of really funny moments in the movie, usually due to the younger two siblings. That girl (Anne I think?) is hilarious, isn't she? Almost every line she said made me laugh. She was so cute and funny. I also was surprised to be entertained by all the conversations between the father and Herb. That little subplot was nice comic relief, and I enjoyed how it dovetailed with the main plot when Charlie overheard them and exploded at the family.\n\nOverall, this was a great first Hitchcock experience, and I'm really looking forward to watching more of his stuff.",

He does this by showing the effects of the arrival of evil Uncle Charlie (the Merry Widow murderer - Joseph Cotten) on his heretofore innocent niece, Young Charlie (Teresa Wright).  As the Master of Suspense (but not surprise), Hitch is able to prolong the audience's anxiety about Uncle Charlie and his doings, as the detectives descend on Santa Rosa (the town) and Young Charlie cottons on.  He also takes the opportunity to work in his classic themes - the banality of evil (and \"wrong-doing\") and the complicity of guilt -- and to display his transgressive sense of humor (for example, Young Charlie's father Henry Travers and neighbor Hume Cronyn read true crime magazines and plot each other's murders). The movie is full of rhymes, starting with the two Charlies and extending to matching or doubled scenes, two suspects, two detectives, and so on. One of Hitchcock's most subversively wicked and fully realized films.",

            "content": "In 1941, Alfred Hitchcock just had \"Suspicion\", but now there isn't... or is a \"Shadow of a Doubt\". Yeah, without the \"Beyond\", it's kind of hard to guess the full level of urgency to this mystery thriller, regarding the possibility of an evil deed being done. Hey, Hitchcock is the Master of Suspense, so either his titles are even supposed to drive you mad with wonderment... or I'm just making up nonsense as I go along because there really is so much ambiguity to this film that it's hard to figure out what to talk about. I mean, it's Hitchcock, and by 1943, alone, he had a pretty firm formula down as a thriller storyteller, and yet, this was one of the first ones that people really remembered. Well, that's probably because, for 1943, it actually was kind of thrilling, at least more so than \"Suspicion\", which was alright and all, but not particularly eventful.  Granted, there's only so much momentum to this thriller, seeing as how there's apparently still a shadow of doubt keeping things from really hitting the fan. Still, the point is that this film is not simply a little more exciting than \"Suspicion\", but actually pretty darn decent, despite the flaws.\n\nWith all my ramblings about rambling thrillers like Alfred Hitchcock's \"Suspicion\", a film held back largely by natural shortcomings, this film itself has its conceptual limitations, of which there aren't enough to prevent compellingness from consistently standing firm, yet nevertheless enough to limit potential that is further shaken by familiarity. On top of being kind of thin, the path followed by this film is too familiar for its own good, or at least seems to, because among its tropes are Hollywood histrionics that are rarely all that carried away, and are ultimately pretty limited in quantity, but still recurring enough, as well as severe enough, to deliver on some questionably dated dialogue and melodramatics. Quite frankly, the big issue behind the histrionics is their betrayal of subtlety, for although this suspense thriller has enough sober intensity to thoroughly intrigue time and again, those lapses in subtlety all but aggravate in their shaking the thriller's genuineness, in addition to the dramatic momentum. Of course, the drama's momentum is not the only loose element to storytelling here, as structural momentum is itself questionable, as the generally solid, though arguably overblown scripting team of Thornton Wilder, Sally Benson and Alma Reville have their moments in which they leave certain segments to feel tight, and leave others to feel draggy, resulting in an inconsistency in pacing that is all but outdone by an inconsistency in tone. Not unlike something like \"Suspicion\", this film gets too lighthearted with its dramatic build-ups, so much so that when tensions begin to rise, they go rather undercut by tonal unevenness, which isn't to say that the dramatic heights are all that soaring, not so much because of storytelling hiccups, but by the natural shortcomings. Hitchcock's direction, at the very least, is actually inspired enough to transcend natural shortcomings and make a mighty compelling and ultimately rewarding dramatic thriller, but it all comes back to the natural shortcomings, which limit dramatic depth, further limited by all of the inconsistencies in tone, pacing and subtlety. Speaking of subtlety, the film runs a risk of subtly, but surely, collapsing into underwhelmingness, yet when it's all said and done, the thriller doesn't simply compel adequately, but proves to be worthy as Hitchcock's first true triumph as a thriller filmmaker, with impact, and even good looks.\n\nLimited by technical limitations of the time, Joseph Valentine's cinematography actually used the shortcomings of the time pretty effectively, carrying a certain fitting black-and-white palette whose bleakness goes reinforced by dapper plays on shadows that draw you into the near-claustrophobically intense environment that this thriller thrives on. Even more essential in the driving of this type of tight thriller is, of course, the characters, who are brought to life about as effectively as the visual style is, in this case by then-solid and still-impressive performances whose subtle dramatic layering is sometimes ahead of the time, and consistently effective. Joseph Cotten proves to be particularly impressive in his slickly charismatic and atmospherically intense portrayal of a seemingly caring man with deep, dark secrets that he can filter out only so much, so much so that Cotten, especially when working with an emotionally roughed Teresa Wright, drives much of this thriller whose bite relies on the minimal, perhaps too much so. Again, in addition to being formulaic, the story concept is kind of thin in scope, having an intentional tightness that threatens compellingness, but also establishes a potential for it through human intensity that screenwriters Sally Benson, Alma Reville and Thornton Wilder sell through well-rounded characterization, and an attention to light bite that was refreshing at the time, and has aged well. Well, maybe the compellingness hasn't aged especially gracefully, but make no mistake, it is ultimately secured, because if there is meat to this idea, its juiced and drawn upon about as much as it can be by highlights in the acting, script and, above all, direction. What can make or break this potentially underwhelming minimalist thriller is, of course, Alfred Hitchcock, who, through this film, surely had to be revelatory as a thriller filmmaker, because where the film's steadiness could have devolved into dullness, Hitchcock's thoughtful storytelling is realized enough in its celebration of bleak style and audacious material to immerse you into the narrative, whose gradual build in intensity is sold every step of the way enough for the film to grow more and more compelling as the plot thickens. I don't suppose the plot ever thickens all that substantially, yet meat never thins all that substantially either, and between thickness and thinness, Hitchcock cuts far enough to the bone to keep you attached, until the shortcomings are, if you will, over\"shadowed\" by thorough intrigue.\n\nOnce the shadows lift, reward value finds itself all but obscured by conventions, subtlety lapses, and pacing and tonal inconsistencies to the telling of an almost thin narrative, yet pronounced enough through fine cinematography, solid performances, - especially by Joseph Cotten - well-characterized writing, and biting direction to make Alfred Hitchcock's \"Shadow of a Doubt\" rewarding as one of the Master of Suspense's first triumphs in suspenseful cinema.\n\n3/5 - Good",

            "content": "This is a great, relatively early film in the Alfred Hitchcock canon. Parts of it have the cheery, all-American small-town feel of a Frank Capra film, but it also goes to darker places than his earlier The 39 Steps ever does, and anticipates films like Rope and Vertigo, as well as David Lynch's Blue Velvet and the recent Stoker. There's a lot of creepy stuff just under the surface of the movie, and it's got brilliant performances.\n\nThe movie opens with a man we come to know as Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) fleeing from detectives in Philadelphia for unspecified reasons. Then we meet his post-high-school-age niece, also known as Charlie (Teresa Wright), who is excited to learn that her beloved Uncle Charlie is coming to visit her and the rest of the family. However, despite Uncle Charlie's superficial charm, the reason why the police are after him eventually gets in the way of the family's seemingly happy visit.\n\nTeresa Wright to a great degree carries this film, and she really is excellent here. Young Charlie's progress from gullible naivete to a troubled awareness of the darkness of the world is handled quite well, and Wright has the earnest charm and expressive face to do justice to the role. Joseph Cotten is terrifically creepy as Uncle Charlie - even before you find out exactly what he may have done, there's something off-putting about this guy. Henry Travers, who played Clarence in It's a Wonderful Life, is wonderful comic relief as young Charlie's father, a milquetoast obsessed with murder mysteries.\n\nHitchcock himself is of course the primary attraction for any of his films, and in this one we see him in full, seemingly easy command of the medium. Everything from the most dramatic camera movements to the most meticulous details of the scenery and lighting is meticulously planned, and it always contributes to the story. If it doesn't quite match his very best films, this is still a very important entry in his body of work, and probably better than just about any of the films he had made before it.",

This allows Hitch to pull off his famous 'twists' throughout the course of the movie, hitting you every now and then with something you simply weren't expecting.\n\nOne of my favourite elements in the movie is the ongoing dialogue between Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn, avid mystery readers who are constantly discussing the best ways to murder each other. Apart from being a bit of comic relief in an otherwise very dark film, it also demonstrates how lightly people think of murder and murderers...until they encounter them face-to-face.\n\nMy advice then, if you want to see this movie, is not to learn anything about it beforehand. Going in with no knowledge will increase the movie's initial impact, and will help you to appreciate why Hitchcock was the 'Master of Suspense'. This is a taut thriller with no gratuitous violence, foul language, or mature situations.\n\n(Hitch considered it 'a family film'.)\n\nEnjoy!",

The niece Charlie loves her uncle, claiming that it's a miracle for him to show up. When a pair of detectives, led by Macdonald Carey, disguised as photographers show up for some information about the family, Young Charlie gets suspicious, and when she finds out the truth, Uncle Charlie starts a plot to kill off his \"favorite\" niece.\r\n\r\nHenry Travers plays Joseph Newton, Charlie's father, a banker, Patricia Collinge plays Charlie's mother, and although I missed this, Alfred Hitchcock supposedly cameos as a man who plays bridge on a train. Boy, does Hitchcock love his trains.\r\n\r\nWith Hitchcock claiming this to be his favorite film, I knew I had to see it. And boy, was I wowed. One again, Hitchcock delivers on the suspense, with some moments coming out as disturbing, such as Uncle Charlie's plots and the really crazy climax on, you guessed it, a train.\r\n\r\nAs for the acting, it's incredible. Joseph Cotton is menacing as the uncle, and some moments are downright creepy, such as a scene where he describes widows as swine. I enjoyed the family portrayed in the film, and it provides some good humor for the 1940's, and still does in 2013. But who is the real star of the film? For me, that would be Teresa Wright as Young Charlie, and SHE'S NOT EVEN A BLONDE!!!!!!     It's incredible that a non-blonde actress, that Hitchcock usually picks in his films, would deliver a strong performance as this. In her scenes with Cotton, the chemistry delivers, even if they weren't a romantic couple, a couple that Hitchcock succeeds a lot.\r\n\r\nHitchcock's favorite film is a winner, even if I prefer Vertigo. To put it straight, Shadow of a Doubt is a Hitchcock delight with a suspenseful plot and some phenomenal casting. Highly recommended for every fan of Hitchcock who hasn't seen it already.",

            "content": "By now, this is the fourth Hitchcock film that I've seen and it certainly is a better representation of what I understood his work to be than SABOTEUR was. SHADOW OF A DOUBT, which Hitchcock said was his favorite, is a rather simple tale that explores one of his favorite themes: mistaken identity. Joseph Cotten (THE THIRD MAN) plays \"Uncle Charlie\" who visits his family for a visit in Santa Rosa, California. However, he's not quite what his young niece Charlie remembers. One thing I've noticed about Hitchcock's films is the various ways he's able to create tension and suspense in a way that keeps the viewer hooked. Some of the elements he uses includes light and shadow, camera angles, the score, etc. All of them came together in a rather cohesive way that kept me interested in seeing where the story would go. This film also captures an America in transition. The world created here isn't the paranoia-filled one of SABOTEUR, but still one where suspicion is very palpable and there's a sense that trust is becoming less of an innate quality in Everytown, USA. Like in SABOTEUR, there are two characters who serve as thematic counterpoint to each other. Here, they are the two Charlies. Joseph Cotten's character is somewhat of an idealized figure for his young niece (Teresa Wright), but the reality of how cynical and pessimistic he really is gets revealed over the course of the film. I thought it was a brilliant way of showing how expectations measure up when faced with reality. There's also the \"is he/isn't he?\" sense of if he's really even the person he purports to be, which plays into the themes of suspicion and trust. One thing I wasn't entirely expecting was the awkward sexual tension (in a few scenes) between the two Charlies, which added an incest layer that helped to flesh out the tense relationship between them. If there's anything weak about the film, the ending was a bit abrupt and a romance that develops between young Charlie and a detective seemed to be shoehorned in (and provided for an unnecessary coda. Still, I liked this film very much and it bodes well for the successive Hitchcock films I'll be viewing later this month.",

            "content": "Yet another Hitchcock masterwork.  This time, the villain (or IS he?) is Charlie Oakley, played to perfection by Joseph Cotten. Charlie is on the East Coast, and slips by some detectives on his way to small town California to stay with his sister and her family. His niece (named after him) is at first delighted to see him, but begins to notice strange things he does and how he reacts oddly to others. When 2 reporters show up at the house to do an interview, it is revealed that they are actually detectives tracking Charlie, as he's one of the suspects for the 'Merry Widow' murders back East. Jack, the younger detective, asks Young Charlie to keep an eye on Uncle Charlie and see what if anything happens. She is torn between loyalty to the Uncle she worships, and the common sense that tells her something isn't right. Is Uncle Charlie really a cold-blooded killer? Or is it just a case of mistaken identity? Hitch has you hanging on until the very last moment to find out what happens.\nThis really is the master of suspense at work...the first chunk of the movie just sets things up, but the second part is where it really takes off. The camera work in Hitchcock films is marvelous making everyday things seem off, and combine it with a score from the great Dimitri Tiomkin (who worked on many Hitchcock scores) and you've got a great piece.  This also includes a famous/infamous speech made by Uncle Charlie about the nature of women that would surely set off a firestorm of controversy today, but in the film is perfectly suited to the character and advancing the plot at the same time. The genius of his films are that they take place in the everyday world, which makes them even more genuinely believable and therefore, potentially able to happen for real, even to people like you and me.  I mean, when a director can make a trip to the library seem like a matter of life and death, you know he's got you in the palm of his hand.\nThe only thing that kept this from 5-stars is the first half, which is a bit slow, and the performance of Teresa Wright as Young Charlie, who really grates on my nerves early on. Keep your eyes open for Henry Travers (Clarence in 'It's a Wonderful Life') and Hume Cronyn.\nRight up there with the Hitchcock classics, but not my absolute favourite. Definitely a must-see though.",

Living in constant peril, \"Charlie\" finally is forced to face him. In the ensuing struggle she fights madly for her life. With the constant discomfort and suspense, Hitchcock proves how powerful thrillers can be even in the home. Cotten and Wright both do a very good job in this film.

Uncle Charlie comes to visit Charlie and her family. Everything is idyllic except for one thing, Uncle Charlie is a mass murder, known as The Merry Widow Murderer. He kills old ladies, who he thinks have no reason to live, and takes their money.

The question is, who will Uncle Charlie kill next.\r\n\r\nJoseph Cotten gives one of his best, if not his very best performance ever. And of course, psychopaths are always scarier when they seem somewhat normal and rational. Cotten isn't known for playing villains, but after seeing this movie, you'll wonder why. Teresa Wright plays young Charlie. Given the character, she really couldn't be much better.

I really liked the psychological battle between Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotton. They really give \"family first\" a whole new meaning. This is one of Hitchcock's best indeed.\n\nGrade: A-",

The narrative doesn't stop to build-up the suspense, and while the viewer knows for most of the time what's really going on, the true quality of the movie comes from the fact that the players don't know, and we're anxious all the time, being unable to help them in any way. That's true realism of this tale. And it's also disturbing. A story about a girl, who becomes convinced that her mysterious uncle is a deadly killer on-the-loose, but isn't able to convince other family members, as there are too little clues and evidence. Great juxtaposition of two marvelous actors, Joseph Cotten as an uncle-from-hell and Theresa Wright as the overly suspicious, yet astute girl with a bold attitude. A Genuine psychological thriller.",

For me, \"Shadow of a Doubt\" is just to disparate for me to embrace. While each of the elements seem interesting on their own, none of it congeals. The film has no back story, you are supposed to be caring for Charlie (or at least that's what the overwrought score seems to convey). How can we care for this main character (and Young Charlie) if we don't know anything about them. We know she is good and he is bad, but WHY? How can we possibly love a character when we know so little about their decision making process? To me, this is lazy filmmaking. The film tries to be thrilling, funny, dark, romantic and fails every step of the way due to the lack of characterization. All we end up with is a film that will only scare the naive morons of Middle America... (which is what the film is about, so maybe it works?... nahhh)",

So understandably, I didn't remember much of it, so when I watched it the other night, it was almost like watching a new movie for me...And I have to say, I loved it the first time I saw it, and I loved the second time I saw it. \r\n\r\nThe Story: A young woman, finds out that her favorite uncle is a ruthless killer. At first she doesn't want to believe it, but it becomes clear to her, that her beloved Uncle Charlie isn't the man she and her family thought he was. It's one of my personal favorite Hitchcock films, partly due to the fact that it was one of the first I'd seen, but also because I love the story. What's more terrifying than a killer in the one place you can truly feel safe? The cinematography is great, and the lighting really makes uncle Charlie look evil. It gets from point A to point B in no time, you won't find any time to be bored with it. An all around great film. \r\n\r\nThe Cast: Teresa Wright, Joseph Cotten...There's more people in the cast but these are the only two that you're really going care about. Joseph Cotten is Uncle Charlie, the charismatic killer. He's so undeniably good at this role that, you'll have no choice but to fear him. Teresa Wright is young Charlie, Uncle Charlies favorite niece. You'll feel such a great connection with her, that you'll actually fear for her life as she's becomes aware of the danger she's in once she solves the mystery of her favorite uncle. These two have great chemistry on screen, Hitchcock knew how to cast people back in the day. \r\n\r\nOne to Five Scale: 5 \r\n\r\nOne of the best Hitchcock films ever made. If you've never seen a movie of his, this one is a great place to start. Every so often at movie stores, you'll find these old movies as re-releases on DVD or even VHS, and if you ever stumble across this one, don't hesitate to pick it up. \r\n\r\nTyler",

Of course, a less significant work from a grandmaster is still plenty good. Even though a lot of the characters are clich\u00e9s or the town is so \"American,\" I noticed implications of young girls desiring older men, and even the relationship between the uncle and niece at times does not seem ethical, although nothing intimate actually happens between them. This is what's most essential in Hitchcock's films, the characters are well groomed, well dressed and appear to be \"perfect,\" yet they are very much like how people are in reality and hold dark secrets. This to me is the essence of a world created by Hitchcock, which only few are able to do, to invent something of your own. Not to go too much into the movie, I would say it was mostly satisfying; however the ending could have been executed better. Joseph Cotten definitely delivers a chilling speech at the dinner table! It is quite strange that Hitchcock considers \"Shadow of a Doubt\" his best work, rather than \"Vertigo,\" \"North by Northwest,\" \"The Wrong Man,\" or \"Rear Window,\" etc. If I am not mistaken Scorsese's favorite from his films was \"The Age of Innocence,\" Welles' was \"Chimes at Midnight,\" and Bergman's favorite was \"Winter Light\" among his work. All those favorites are not considered the very best of their respective director by the majority. I guess everyone has their own preferences.",

            "content": "This film according to interviews with director Alfred Hitchcock was his favorite to make. He enjoyed the thought of bringing danger and evil to a small town. I will say this is one of the better of the Hitchcock films, but it has aged in a way that some moments to me are creepy in different ways. Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright) is a young teenage lady that is living in her small little town. One day her favorite uncle that she hasn't seen in quite some time Charlie Oakley (Joseph Cotten) arrives in town. Charlie herself was named after Uncle Charlie and she's always felt a strong connection to him. Things seem to be great, but Uncle Charlie starts acting very suspicious. Cutting out certain articles in the newspaper about a murderer, acting strange around everyone else and overall just being kind of plain creepy. Soon enough Charlie's family is visited by Jack Graham (Macdonald Carey) and Fred Saunders (Wallace Ford) two undercover detectives that are actually looking into Uncle Charlie showing up as he is one of two suspects in a string of murders. Soon enough Charlie realizes that Uncle Charlie is not the man he said he is which leads Uncle Charlie to start plotting on how to silence young Charlie for good. Ok, so as opposed to Saboteur (1942) i found the pacing for this movie to be great. This is the second time I've seen this film and I remember not exactly being the greatest fan last time, but I enjoyed it more this time. Uncle Charlie is just creepy. Cotten does a great job in his portrayal here and I really found him to be the kind of suave gentlemen with a very dark secret. Wright as Charlie is kind of annoying. She's very naive in the beginning and she even has a subplot with Jack that was very strange to me since Charlie is a teenager and Jack is a full grown man. This romance subplot comes out of nowhere and gives me that 1940's feel of shitty writing. Yup once again I'm criticizing the great Hitchcock, but come on. The suspense here is great though and I overall enjoyed the twists and turns this one brings. I still don't appreciate the somewhat sudden endings to all these films though and would like a bit more meat on the backend, but like I said before that's the 1940's style here. Overall, a better film than Saboteur and overall a pretty solid film. We aren't quite at the legendary status of Hitchcock films yet, but we are getting there!",

            "content": "Have you ever had a family member that you dearly love who has been keeping a dark secret about themselves from you for your whole life? If so, then you'll be the first to relate to the main character of Alfred Hitchcock's 1943 mystery Shadow of a Doubt. Our main protagonist is Charlotte \"Charlie\" Newton (Teresa Wright), a bored teenager in a small California town who has just learned that her uncle (Joseph Cotten), with the same name, is coming to town to visit her and her family. During his visit, she notices that her uncle is acting very odd at times, mainly when he refuses to have his picture be taken by strangers. Things change further when she discovers the last thing that her uncle would want her to discover, that he may indeed be a murderer on the run. \n\nDirector Alfred Hitchcock considered Shadow of a Doubt his favorite film out of all the films he made. Coming from the same talented filmmaker who made Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), and Psycho (1960), that's a high honor indeed. Looking at it again, I can certainly understand why that might be. It's basically a story about a young woman who goes through the most backstabbing situation she could find herself in. That, of course, being that she has a family member whom she can no longer trust because of a crime they committed. What's worse is that she wanted to know what secret this person was keeping from her in the first place. It's devastating because she sees another side to this person that she never thought she'd see and also didn't want them to become. \n\nShadow of a Doubt tells a powerful story that reminds us that there are going to be family members that aren't always going to be as trustworthy as we think they will be. No matter how hard we try to keep in touch with everyone in our families, there's always going to be difficulty in keeping tabs on each other and trying to know everything about a certain family member. In the case of the relationship between Uncle Charlie and Charlotte's mother Emma (Patricia Collinge), we have a brother-sister relationship in which the brother is trying to keep a secret that would separate him from his sister further. \n\nIf there are times in this movie in which you have to close your eyes because the worst thing imaginable is about to happen to these characters, then that means this film is doing its job. The reason being is that through all this dread with Charlotte emotionally separating further from her uncle, there is underlying suspense that indicates that it only gets worse. The screenplay by Thornton Wilder, Sally Benson, and Alma Reville creates tension all throughout the film and makes these characters feel real. It's fascinating that Charlotte's father (Henry Travers) invites his neighbor (Hume Cronyn) over for dinner every night just to talk about committing the perfect crime. All I can say is it's no wonder Charlotte doesn't react kindly to these conversations at dinner on top of her dilemma with her uncle. \n\nI sincerely believe that films and shows along the lines of Breaking Bad owe their existence to this masterful thriller. Joseph Cotten is chillingly good as the fishy uncle and Teresa Wright is full of life as his most cherished niece. The plot is powerful and very well paced by Hitchcock and his screenwriters. To talk any more about Shadow of a Doubt would only spoil the suspense along with your enjoyment of seeing it firsthand. So by all means, check out this Hitchcock classic and see why it's Hitchcock's own personal favorite.",

This does not make Cotten's performance bad, on the contrary,  he's incredibly terrifying. But without a doubt the best in show is Teresa Wright, whose performance is absolutely brilliant. She goes from innocent to paranoid so naturally and believably, that you're waiting to see what she'll do next and if Joseph Cotten will thwart her. Still, with a better climax and an ending that doesn't feel so rushed, this would've easily been counted as one of Hitchock's best. As it is now, it's a good movie with a fantastic performance from Teresa Wright.",

However, you've got to hand it over to Joseph Cotten's chilling role as Charlie Oakley for making this a somewhat stylish thriller. At the same time, I wouldn't say the same thing for the other performances - definitely not for Teresa Wright's forever chiming Charlie Newton. By far  the biggest disappointment of all was, in my view, the final scene at Charlie's funeral - what a sudden and anti-climatic ending! Let's just hope that none of the other Merry Widow murderers end up in such a macabre and lifeless funeral ceremony as that. And one more thing - wasn't it obvious to Mrs Newton that the garage scene, where Charlie almost got suffocated to death, was no accident? Seems like the sky would have fallen on her and yet she and her family would remain just as oblivious. Those wonderful techniques Hitchcock used in this (such as the dialogue and that revelation scene in the library where Charlie finally realizes her ideal uncle's real worth) were what I ultimately enjoyed. Other than that, Shadow of a Doubt left didn't leave me a shadow of a doubt with regards to its drab plainness.",

But Charlie's delight soon gives way to suspicion, then fear, then terror as she gradually comes to realize that he is hiding a dark secret -- that he is a serial killer on the run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is said to be Hitchcock's personal favorite among all the movies he made, and he was well within his rights to be very, very proud of it. With a script that is absolutely perfect in every way, a setting that captures the essence of the idyllic small American town so perfectly that Ray Bradbury would be moved to tears, and a cast that all deliver great performances in parts it seems they were born to play, there simply is not a single sour note in this movie.\r\n\r\nIt starts with a script that deftly sets up all its characters and manages to draw them as fully realized, three-dimension people within minutes of their first appearances on screen... usually through subtle character actions or exchanges. The most impressive of these is the film's lead character, a typical whiny restless teenager who in a script from lesser writers and interpreted by a lesser director would have been extremely annoying and someone you might wish ill upon. However, the character is so deftly written here and her reactions so believable--a mixture of childishness and adult and perception of what it means to be an adult--that you are rooting for her almost from the moment she is introduced into the story. \r\n\r\nThe same is true of the opposite side of the coin, the film's other Charlie... a man on the run with a secret, who may or may not be a serial killer. Like Young Charlie, he is deftly established a few touches that are followed up with further development that lends texture and deep character to him. \r\n\r\nThese two characters, and the oft-referenced \"special bond\" that exists between them, are the solid center around which story and other characters rotate, each developed as they relate to the two Charlies and each eventually emerging as fully realized as they are. Even the \"special bond\" ends up taking on personality, evolving from childish imaginings born of coincidences to something more real and that gives sinister weight to either Charlie when the younger of the two promises she will kill the older one if he hurts her mother.\r\n\r\nHeck, this script is so perfect that the insta-romance the develops between Young Charlie and one of the detectives who come into town on Uncle Charlie's tail doesn't bother me one bit. Where this has nearly ruined a couple other Hitchcock films for me, here it \r\n\r\nOf course, as well-written as these characters are, they would have withered in the hands of the wrong actor. Here, the casting is so absolutely perfect that the actors have an exponential impact when it comes to breathing life into the characters. Casting Joseph Cotton as a serial killer, who up to this point in his career had played nothing but lovable good guys, was a stroke of genius, and petite Teresa Wright nails her teenaged character perfectly despite being 25 at the time this film was made. Even the bit-players--like the small town's librarian and traffic cop--fit their roles perfect and instantly make the audience feel they know the person in question.\r\n\r\nThe great script and the perfectly cast actors are further supported by a great location and even better sets. A problem I sometimes have with Hitchcock's American films is sometimes jarring and obvious difference between footage made on sets or the studio back lot versus footage made on location. The quality of the environments change so drastically that I am sometimes pushed out of being absorbed in the movie. Not so here. Location and sound stage merge seamlessly and undetectably to form a perfect whole.\r\n\r\nIf you only watch one Hitchcock film, this is the one to choose.",

It's still somewhat shocking when you see that monologue today because it's so raw and features an abundance of anger and emotion.

Before we find out about Uncle Charlie's past, we get to know him just like the other family members do, so that we understand how impossible it sounds to them that he could be a killer.\r\n\r\nThe build-up for this film is some of the greatest I have ever seen in film. The film makes scenes that seem normal and yet make you sit on the edge of your seat. Alfred Hitchcock has always been a fantastic director, and this is some of his best work. He creates suspense with nearly every single shot, even if the scene on screen is charming. This creates an atmosphere in which anything can happen and gives the movie an unpredictable aspect about it.\r\n\r\nThe performance for Uncle Charlie is also very good. Joseph Cotton gives one of the most realistic performances ever. He does good as the man we know is hiding something, and yet at the same time gives a fa\u00e7ade so flawlessly that nobody suspects who he really is.\r\n\r\nThis film is almost flawless from start to finish. The beginning picks up your undivided attention, and the ending comes to a satisfying emotional turmoil and takes your breath away. The pacing is done really well, the acting is great from everybody, and there some real romantic chemistry between the two leads.\r\n\r\nAlfred Hitchcock often cited this film as his favorite film of his own, and who could blame him? Even though I've only seen a few, out of those, this is my 2nd favorite film that he has made, behind only Rear Window. A masterpiece in its own right, Shadow of a Doubt isn't given enough recognition, especially considering how well-crafted it is. Bravo.\r\n\r\n9.9/10",

He claimed that Jimmy Stewart ruined \"Vertigo\" and he ended up hating the film and never speaking to the actor again, I on the other hand think it's his crowing achievement and a fantastic Stewart performance. For me, \"Shadow of a Doubt\" is just to disparate for me to embrace. While each of the elements seem interesting on their own, none of it congeals. The film has no back story, you are supposed to be caring for Charlie (or at least that's what the overwrought score seems to convey). How can we care for this main character (and Young Charlie) if we don't know anything about them. We know she is good and he is bad, but WHY? How can we possibly love a character when we know so little about their decision making process? To me, this is lazy filmmaking. The film tries to be thrilling, funny, dark, romantic and fails every step of the way due to the lack of characterization. All we end up with is a film that will only scare the naive morons of Middle America... (which is what the film is about, so maybe it works?... nahhh)",

Then again that's true of a large portion of Hitchcock's work; with the exception of a few masterpieces (some that are masterpieces perhaps also only on their technical merit, but that burst at the seams with it), many of his pictures seems to stem from tackling the challenge of taking one suspenseful idea that is probably in no way new and turning into an entertaining low-budget feature-length movie.  The sort of thing Stephen King has done with writing (King once referred to himself as \"the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries\").  At any rate, this is exactly the sort of movie that backs up my assertion that Charlie Chaplin and Stanley Kubrick are the two smartest people ever to come out of Hollywood; while Shadow of a Doubt is a masterful effort by a consistently strong auteur, the bulk of Hitchcock's work could be obliterated by almost any single randomly selected Chaplin or Kubrick feature.",

Uncle Charlie brings with him lavish gifts and over time she gets to feel something is fishy especially when they are visited by two supposed surveyors who turn out to be detectives (she knows of it after Det. Jack Graham played by Macdonald Carey takes her on a date). Turns out her beloved uncle is the wanted serial killer known as the \"Merry Widow Murderer\". \r\nThe tension really builds towards the second half of the movie when Charlie and her uncle turn confrontational. Cotton is good playing the sweet faced killer - you really feel he continues to deceive us until the very end of the film. It holds well after all these years - it is a clean, well and smoothly layered and constructed piece of cinema. \"Shadow of a Doubt\" is definitely a unique movie within Hitchcock's extensive resume but not one of his utmost best!

The only other Hitchcock film I've seen to date is \"The Birds.\" Yes, I am missing out on many classic films, currently working on it. Anyways, Shadow of a Doubt is a masterfully made film. It is more suspenseful than most films I've seen in recent years. The subtle acting of the two leads also helps propel this film.\r\n\r\nThis film is, once you boil it down, about the relationships between two characters: Charlies and... well Charlie. They are both seemingly nice people, and it is established early that they are not interested in material things. Of course both have deal with this very differently. In the beginning of the film Hitchcock makes their relationship appear as if it may lead to a sexual one. Of course they are Uncle and Niece, and so seeing the two flirting and being close make the viewer very uncomfortable. It is rather brilliant.\r\n\r\nThere are so many motifs, subtleties and attention to detail that makes the film intriguing without even focusing on the plot. Hitchcock uses camera angles, recurring themes and photographic images to aid in the storytelling. Take the introductions of Charles and Charlie. Both these scenes are parallel to each other, showing both characters lying on their bed, shrouded in shadows. These small touches, and motifs really drew me in to the film, and made me yearn to watch more, and isn't that what a film is supposed to do?  \r\n\r\nThere are several images in the film that are hauntingly beautiful. As Charlie's brother stands at the train station, becoming enveloped by the shadows of the train, When Uncle Charlie is describing his hatred for rich widows and turns to the camera and says \"Are they?,\" And the devastating scene of young charlie realizing that her uncle is getting away with his crime and stares at him in the doorway. All of these images will most likely be etched in my memory for eternity. \r\n\r\nThis film has no gratuitous violence, in fact it has none. It is a quieter film than most thrillers today. I will need to watch it again in order to pick up on the numerous details of it. I suggest you do the same.",

While the ending leaves a gaping plot hole and some of the dialogue can come across as corny and obvious, the positives outweigh the negatives largely here. Both Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright do what is expected of them skillfully (although the beginning of their relationship is quite, unintentionally, somewhat inappropriately \"touchy\", if you will). Still, what makes this film a classic is Hitchcock's feel for increasing suspense until his coda, where everything explodes and its entirely satisfying (the act, that is, not quite the aftermath). Definitely a must-see for any Hitchcock fan.",

This is because \"Shadow of a Doubt\" is not a mystery film: it's suspense. Alfred Hitchcock once said that he was not interested in mystery. He explained that the surprise felt when the mystery is revealed is nothing compared to keeping suspense throughout the film. I agree.\r\n\r\n\"Shadow of a Doubt\" is a film about a man named Charlie Oakley, a real charmer with plenty of swagger to go around. From the very opening of the film, we can see that he has done something wrong and that he is being watched. Charlie decides to hide away as a guest in his sister's house. His niece, Charlotte, was named after him, and she goes by the name \"Charlie\". As soon as Charlie comes to stay at the house, everyone is happy to see him, most of all Charlotte. But as she begins to learn more about him, and what he has done, she wants him out. The problem: Charlie knows that she is privy to his crimes, and will stop at nothing to keep her silent.\r\n\r\n\"Shadow of a Doubt\" is a taut suspense film with plenty of dark humor as well. Like much of Hitchcock's work, it will keep you on the edge of your seat till the very end.",

Joseph Cotten seems the perfect actor for this role as he can also pull off the menacing look a character like Charlie needs. \n\nSpoiler Alert I guess, I was thinking almost hoping that a twist would happen somewhere along the line where Cotten's character would be revealed to be innocent (which kind of did happen, but not exactly), and all the misleading evidence would be explained. Well, this didn't happen, but I kept thinking that he really wasn't a serial killer. Even after the death traps for some reason I still remained skeptical, although it should've been obvious at that point. I think that's what made my viewing so compelling though - I thought just as Charlie Newton did, that he couldn't have been the killer. I think that perspective is useful in relating to Teresa Wright's character and it makes Charlie Oakley seem that much more mysterious and interesting.\n\nRegardless, it's a great movie.",

But when suspicion is cast on the man that she was named after, can she accept that he might be a killer? If he finds out what she suspects, could that put even the life of his beloved niece in jeopardy? \n\nI don't really know how to review Shadow of a Doubt. I found myself liking it, even though I can't give any particular reasons why. In fact, I found it to be meandering and a little unfocused, at times. Yet it still left me with a positive impression. It had a different feel from any of the other Hitchcock movies that I've seen. There's little mystery to it, and the thrills and suspense are of a different kind than those that were offered in North by Northwest or Notorious. I'd struggle to compare this to any of his other movies. Yet, the director felt that it was his favorite. I can't deny that I found the relationship between Charlie and her uncle to be interesting, in all its phases. And since so much of the plot hinges on that, then perhaps that explains some of Shadow of a Doubt's likeability.   \n\nI'd say that if you're a fan of Hitchcock, give this film about family menace in Santa Rosa a try. It's a bit of an odd duck, yet it was entertaining, nonetheless. I put it firmly in the middle of the pack of Hitchcock's movies.",

As I finished watching it for the first time recently, it occurred to me that this may be because of just how \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerican\u00e2\u0080\u009d the atmosphere and aesthetics of the movie are. This can undoubtedly be attributed to Thornton Wilder, who receives story credit on the film, and whose brilliant 1938 play \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur Town\u00e2\u0080\u009d also depicts how unforeseen changes can affect a small American town. Hitchcock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first American film, and my personal favorite of his, was \u00e2\u0080\u009cRebecca\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The change in mood and tone between that and \u00e2\u0080\u009cShadow\u00e2\u0080\u009d is considerable, and it shows the versatility of the director, as he maintains his style through unique blends of culture and genre.\n\nCharlotte \u00e2\u0080\u009cCharlie\u00e2\u0080\u009d Newton (Teresa Wright) is a bright young girl who is intensely bored and dismayed with her uneventful life. She lives with her family in a small Northern California town where everyone knows each other. That is until she one day decides that she is going to send a telegram requesting her Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten), whom she is named after, come and visit. Charlie is her favorite relative, and as she arrives at the post office to send her message, she discovers that he is already en route to visit her and the family. This is where it first becomes clear that there is either something telepathic going on between the two characters, or perhaps Hitchcock and Wilder are playing around with coincidence and chance.\n\nThe most interesting thing about the characters that inhabit this small town is that each of them is slightly off-kilter from what one would expect. Charlotte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chirpy mother Emma (Patricia Collinge) pitter-patters around the house, yapping on and on about topics that have long been forgotten by all others in the room. When her brother Charlie arrives, she is so delighted, as she dotes upon his every need and concern, naively shrugging off his bizarre and morose rants about women and the world itself. These moments come quite unexpectedly, and without much warning, as do most of Charlie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s darker impulses. He is, after all, her \u00e2\u0080\u009cspoiled\u00e2\u0080\u009d younger brother. Why should he have anything to hide?\n\nWith \u00e2\u0080\u009cShadow\u00e2\u0080\u009d, Hitchcock is able to masterfully blend the typical small-town America with the darkness that quietly prowls beneath it.  After Charlotte begins to suspect that Charlie is whom the papers are calling the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMerry Widow Murderer\u00e2\u0080\u009d, strange and sinister events start to unfold, as a couple of detectives posing as government survey men show up and throw her entire sense of security and perception of her uncle off balance. There are wonderfully placed scenes of comic relief amongst the danger and mystery, featuring Charlotte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father Joseph (Henry Travers) and his friend Herbie (Hume Cronyn), who are both unsolved crime story enthusiasts. They frequently get together and discuss different ways in which they would murder each other. It provides the film with splendid irony and even suspense in one scene when they are at the dinner table discussing how to get away with murder right in front of murderous Uncle Charlie and his next target. \n\nI recently watched David Lynch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlue Velvet\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the first time, and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t decide where my thoughts lie with it until I have watched it a second time. I think that there is an undeniable link to be made between Hitchcock and Lynch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s depictions of small-town America being infested and challenged by dark forces. There is a scene in \u00e2\u0080\u009cShadow\u00e2\u0080\u009d where Charlie takes his niece to a small \u00e2\u0080\u009cunderground\u00e2\u0080\u009d club, a place she says she would never normally go. There is a waitress who speaks to them briefly, and it is in this scene that I was reminded of \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlue Velvet\u00e2\u0080\u009d. From there, many details that followed also reminded me of Lynch, and of the way that he envisioned his small town USA and all of its quirky, off-center characters. The difference lies in how far the two directors go with the split of dark and light, and how far into each they descend. Hitchcock wisely shows the two sides rather evenly, and often times in the same room together. Unlike Dennis Hopper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character in Lynch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s film, Uncle Charlie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live in the darkness, but rather the light; the darkness lives in him, and as his desperation grows, he looses control and is forced to act on his inner impulses.\n\nThis is one of Hitchcock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s films that I had never heard much about, and although it is now considered a classic, it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do much business, critically or financially, when it was first released in 1943. I think it was ahead of its time, as many of his projects were. It is an outstanding piece of work that deserves the highest praise possible. The performances by Cotten, Wright, Collinge, and Cronyn (his first film) are pitch perfect. The writing is so sharp and exciting that I would consider it to be one of my favorite scripts of all time.\n\n Charlotte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother warns her in one scene, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you whisper, anyone could hear you a block away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That line is so well timed, and it is one of the many elements of the movie that elevate it to brilliance. It is a difficult task to blend the darkness and the light, and to still maintain such vivid suspense and biting humor. Hitchcock directs with utter precision and nothing less, and brings us another classic thriller that will hopefully be preserved for ages and ages to come.",

I think it was mainly due to talentless acting and the need to provide vast minutes of wasted time to fill in the gaps to an exciting story that would not have had a sufficient runtime. There was something missing in this film: Suspense. This slow-boiler film noir is deemed Hitchcock's favorite film that he has made. I'm sure it looked great on paper, but the delivery was lost in the dull delivery of this film.\n\nIt truly is a shame, because some parts of this were really well done, the famed \"dinner scene\" got me listening intently and made way for a much awaited plot twist. But the characters (especially the women) are one dimensional and at times very annoying and even dim-witted. Surprising coming from the master of suspense.... I just did not feel any real tension.\n\nThis could be blamed on the advancement of technology and the laxness films have these days with the censors, but I do not come from a CGI-loving background, and am very supportive of slower paced films that are both gripping and enjoyable. I could refer to the films of Michael Haneke (particularly Funny Games), a slow-boiling film with not many characters, yet the delivery makes all the difference, whereas in Shadow of a Doubt, you wander around much unneeded sequences for about 90 minutes to finally cut to the chase, and then it just ends abruptly. These are the way films seemed to have been made back then, and especially since the release of Citizen Kane in 1941, there were were some directors trying to emulate Orson Welles' style. This film has some throwbacks to Citizen Kane, but not many, as Hitchcock had a very unique vision.\n\nThis film could have been better. Needed to up the excitement rather than focus on a passive mystery.",

Teresa Wright plays the niece and Joseph Cotten (\"Citizen Kane\") the uncle.  The acting is good.

If the film was made today, the approach to the \"Uncle Charlie\" character would have been left a little ambiguous, which I think Hitchcock could have pulled off, but it is an artistic license Hollywood is still not ready to allow at that period of time. Joseph Cotten's character, \"The Merry Widow Murderer\" shares the same motivations  as that of Chaplin's Monsieur Verdoux, but their bitter sentiments about the realities of life differs, but there is no doubt that the two were the product of a harsh, unforgiving world.",

While it isn't my favorite of the directors (that would be \"Strangers on a Train\"), it is certainly one of Hitchcock's classic works and deserving of such distinction.  Two things I really like about this film is the somewhat satirical and relatively light tone that is taken for much of the film for what is essentially a serial killer mystery.  One of my favorite hallmarks of Hitchcock is the bizarre tone he chose in several of his pictures for what is essentially very dark and dramatic material.  You see it in a picture like \"Rope\", where Jimmy Stewart is discussing the practicality of murder in the same way one would discuss the purchase of new curtains for a window.  And in the aforementioned \"Strangers on a Train\", where a psychotic spoiled young man casually discusses the murder of his own man and a stranger's wife, as if it is perfectly natural for such conversations to take place in public settings.  The scenes where \"Uncle Charlie\" is working to fit in comfortably with what is essentially an \"All-American family\" are often as comical as they are suspenseful.  I enjoyed the story in this film, especially Joseph Cotten's performance as the man under suspicion who is living among the family.  Teresa Wright is also very good;  she manages to shift between a steadfast young woman who stubbornly believes her uncle's innocence to a confused young woman who believes \"Charlie\" might have a terrible secret with relative ease.  And of course the direction is spot-on;  I wouldn't expect anything less from Hitchcock.  This film doesn't pack quite as much of a punch as some of my favorite Hitchcock flicks, but it is still makes for entertaining fare.",

            "content": "If there was any question that Alfred Hitchcock had his style down pat before the much-lauded color classics, SHADOW OF A DOUBT puts that to rest. The British-born director displays an uncanny understanding not only of the American psyche, but of the forces of evil that prey there. In a time when Hollywood was plagued with quickie melodramas with lackluster talent, the inimitable Master of Suspense cut through the bullshit and produced a film of real quality. \r\n\r\nIn a seedy New Jersey tenement building, perfectly a propos, we first meet one of Hitch's most memorable villains-- Uncle Charlie. The coldly handsome Joseph Cotten was born to play the part, a role which like all of Hitchock's nemiseses is highly complex and multi-layered. Nothing is black and white beyond the film itself. \r\n\r\nUncle Charlie rouses himself from his contemplations to the discovery that two suit-clad men have staked out the building. The wily Cotten eludes his pursuers and boards a cross-continental train bound for his elder sister Emma's residence, the sleepy small town of Santa Rosa, California.\r\n\r\nIn classic style, the opening shot of Uncle Charlie is mirrored by that of another supine character, who we discover is the \"other\" Charlie-- played by the far prettier Teresa Wright. Worried that her household is stuck \"in a rut,\" she implores her father and mother to invite her beloved Uncle Charlie to visit, just to \"shake things up a little bit.\" Her mother demures, arguing that her uncle has more important things to do than visit them.\r\n\r\nBut of course, before she need despair over her parents having denied her request, Uncle Charlie announces via telegram his impending arrival. \"Do you believe in telepathy?\" asks young Charlie to the world-weary telegram operator. A running theme, we will discover, is the uncle and niece kinsmanship, in which young Charlie attests that she and her uncle are twins. But are they, really?\r\n\r\nThe darkness of New Jersey and the subtle moral deficiency we sense in Cotten's character are again seen, in a brilliant shot, when the train's long shadow encompasses the happy family waiting at the station. The potent symbolism, though somewhat below the radar, is just one of many examples of the decrepitude we'll get the vibe of from Hitch's master direction. \r\n\r\nThe small family of which young Charlie is a prominent member is brilliantly casted, each actor/actress inhibiting their roles sublimely. With the exception of Patricia Collinge's slightly overacted performance as the family matriarch, you sense the cast's preparedness and competence for their respective parts. Also of note is Henry Travers as the father and the know-it-all younger sister, Ann. And not slighting the other family member, youngest brother Roger, but his wasn't much of a remarkable role. \r\n\r\nHumor in the film is provided by the banter between a family friend, Herbie Hawkins (the talented Hume Cronyn), and the father. In classic Hitchcock humor, the two hold morbid conversations inspired by the mystery fiction the two enjoy. In my favorite line from the film, Cronyn's character says earnestly: \"Well, if I was gonna kill you, I wouldn't do a dumb thing like hitting you on the head. First of all, I don't like the fingerprint angle. Of course, I could always wear gloves. Press your hands against the pipe after you were dead and make you look like a suicide. Except it don't seem hardly likely that you'd beat yourself to death with a club. I'd murder you so it didn't look like murder.\"\r\n\r\nTogether the family welcomes Uncle Charlie to their charming home, a two story affair that perfectly conjures up the innocent feel of the characters. Young Charlie especially is effusive in welcoming her uncle, who at this point gives off ever stronger vibes that he is up to no good, and at first refuses the present he gives her on the grounds that his presence is gift enough. Eventually persuaded to accept it, young Charlie discovers in her all-trusting way that the stunning emerald ring has already been monogrammed-- \"CN to LL\" or something of the like. Her uncle is quick to call it a jeweler's mistake, and his niece doesn't suspect a thing. \r\n\r\nIn another scene indicative of Charlie's unnoticed menace, the uncle rashly tears off a piece of the father's evening paper, a piece that we will later discover is tantamount to understanding the crimes Charlie has committed. In another spry defense, he merrily uses the rest of the paper to construct a newspaper house for the children. Young Ann, especially, is not buying it from the outset. \r\n\r\nAnd so the multi-faceted plot boils down to a simple question: will Uncle Charlie's menace threaten the family that adores him?\r\n\r\nNot only do the plot and cast draw you into the film, the sleepy Santa Rosa acts as a third character in the movie. Hitchcock chose SHADOW OF A DOUBT as his personal favorite because he so enjoyed the prospect of corrupting an innocent small town with a swarthy villain. \r\n\r\nAnd it's easy to see how he could enjoy it, and why nearly 70 years later it still holds up as one of Hitch's best efforts. A likeable cast, in tandem with the Master of Suspense's direction, is a sure-fired recipe for thrills and chills of the first order. Not a SHADOW OF A DOUBT about it.",

One of the best, little touches, the film offers is the father's relationship with his best friend. They discuss literature, and have a running conversation throughout the film where they try and come up with the best ways of killing each other. It's these little moments that add humour but hint at disaster. It's a wonderful film, and unlike the thrillers of today, stays it's course and keeps it's tone.",

Equally as effective is Joseph Cotten at is most sinister.\r\n\r\nThe strong supporting cast includes MacDonald Carey, Henry Travers (Clarence from it s a Wonderful Life) and Hume Cronyn.\r\n\r\nThe script that so effectively works at building the suspense in the small town locale was co-written by Thorton Wilder (Our Town).\r\n\r\nAs has often been cited this was reportedly Hitchcock's personal favorites amongst his own films.",

I love how this movie has a real subversive edge about the illusion of safety that small towns provide.  While it is a mere thriller on the surface it?s really about the Teresa Wright character?s coming of age and newly found self awareness.

After reading a little bit about it I discovered quite a bit of symbolism especiallyabout  how the two Charlies are the two sides of the same coin. Joseph Cottten is an amazing villain. The suspense is maintained until the very end of the film and the film is has a fantastic atmosphere: I really loved the beginning where the viewer is trying to understand what is going on. It is a wonder how the two basically naive parents gave birth to those two extraordinarily inteligent daughters! The way Uncle Charlie talks about life and especially widows never make them suspicous not to mention the blatant attempts of Uncle Charlie to kill their daughter! The recurring Merry Widow theme with the dancers is a nice touch. Also the emphasis on Uncle Charlie's strong hands: genious! I strongly reccomend it!",
