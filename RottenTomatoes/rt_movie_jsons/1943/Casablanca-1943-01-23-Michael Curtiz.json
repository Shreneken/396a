I have never seen a more tragic yet such beautifully told love tory in my entire film watchlist.\n\nFirst of all, this film looks stunning. Each and every shot in this film is placed and lit perfectly. You see everything there is you need to see and something more. I have always loved how older movies used to have that 4:3 aspect ratio and directors had to instruct the production designers and cinematographers to make arrangements in a specific manner so as to get everything that is required in the gorgeous standing shot instead of the current trend of a wide shot. Casablanca is no different, everything is in camera and the placement of each and every object (even the doors and windows) is perfect. Production Design along with Direction and Cinematography at its peak.\n\nNow, the story, it is absolutely beautiful. At present, we've seen many love stories that have been told in the backdrop of a war but none of them have quite left an impact on me like this one did. The characters are all compelling and each one of them provide something to move the plot forward. The story essentially follows the tale of Richard Blaine who is an exquisite Saloon-Owner in the territory of Casablanca when he encounters a man called Victor Laszlo and his wife Ilsa Lund who previously had an affair with Richard and is now on the run from the Germans and wants to get to America to help the refugees trapped in a concentration camp in France. The story of Richard evolving into a man he swore never to become due to past incidents is what makes him literally me.\n\nThe music of this film is just so good to hear. Each and every song is instantly a classic for me and trust me, I will be getting this on vinyl one day, that's a promise. The songs Knock on Wood and As Time Goes By were the standouts for me and you should definitely check them out.\n\nI think, this film has now set a new bar for me. A perspective through which I will be judging future romantic dramas from now on and I don't think many will come closer to this.",

There are few films that can legitimately compete for the title of \"the best film of all time,\" with Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, and this film, Casablanca, invariably in the top spots.  One could argue, that the cinematography was not up to the standards of the other three, but it undoubtably has the best screenplay in most memorable lines of any of them.  Also, unlike Citizen Kane which most modern audiences watch with more admiration than actual enjoyment, Casablanca holds up amazingly well for pure entertainment despite the decades.  If it has any weaknesses, it is only that its themes became so famous that they might seem like clich\u00e9's modern audiences, but it is important to remember that they started here.",

I honestly don't care that it's an old film, I personally think that's not a convincing enough excuse for hating a film as wonderful as this , because you are seriously missing out, if you haven't seen it. The cinematography is just fantastic, with clever brooding camera-work. The music by Max Steiner is outstanding, from the sweeping haunting love theme As Time Goes By, to the excerpts of the french national anthem. The scene where everyone starts singing in the caf\u00e9 was extraordinary and one of the many highlights of the film. The screenplay is unquestionably one of the finest in the history of cinema, right up there with Shawshank Redemption and All About Eve, containing great memorable lines such as \"seems as though Destiny is at hand\". The performances were superlative, Humphrey Bogart giving one of cinema's greatest lead performances as the \"cynical sentimentalist\" Rick Blain. Also superb are Ingrid Bergman who positively lights up the screen as Ilsa, the young woman who breaks his heart, Paul Henreid as the fugitive husband, and Claude Rains as Captain Renault. The plot is a little complicated, but I couldn't help being impressed with the performances and the screenplay. Not to mention a timeless love story that I don't think has ever been topped. Overall, a masterpiece, that quite rightly received an academy award for best picture. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

It's got a relatable yet powerful story, great performances from (most of) the cast, and some incredible music. I'm also impressed at how well the humor works in this movie; it's dry but really funny and it lands well despite the bleak circumstances.\n\nA few technical complaints: the accents are all over the place in this movie, ranging from pretty good to wildly over-the-top, but Ingrid Bergman's accent is particularly terrible and inconsistent to the point of distraction. Also, every time Sam is \"playing\" the piano he's clearly not actually playing \ud83e\udd37\n\nOnto this movie's biggest flaw, which is how quickly it expects me to forget about all the seriously fucked up shit that Captain Renault did. He was literally raping desperate women in exchange for travel documents!! Nick clearly knows about this and doesn't approve as we see him rig the casino to spare one woman from this fate, yet I'm supposed to believe just a few days later they're walking off together to \"the start of a beautiful friendship\"? Yeah no fuck that and fuck Captain Renault.\n\nBut anyway, it's a good movie for 1942, and most of it has aged pretty well. The character development is valid and earned and makes for a very engaging watch.",

(The fact that the movie is black-and-white did not detract from the experience.) Part of what makes the plot appealing is that there is no arguably no clear protagonist, just a cast of characters, each with an important backstory, each acting in their own self-interest. Rather than try to teach a lesson, this movie commands attention by creating a believable plot, and believable characters, and then shining a mirror at our own human nature. You are forced to ask yourself, \"What would I have felt? What would I have done?\" Because the characters act in believable ways, the movie is able to give its audience a feel-good ending that is satisfying but not trite, and that is why this movie is a classic.

Here's why:\n\nVictor Laszlo accepted Rick Blaine's bullshit story, that Ilsa Lund no longer loved him, that it was in the past. But it was a worse lie than any told by either Victor or Sam. Which Louis pointed out. Yet, say he swallowed it. There were other lies that Victor had swallowed and was willing to continue to swallow. And he's just as willing to force Ilsa into being his partner in a cacophony of moral crimes.\n\nLook at Ilsa's body language, turning away from Victor's milquetoast kisses. He never kisses Ilsa's mouth, only brushes her cheek or forehead. Ilsa, in turn, saves all her passion for Rick. They embrace intimately and repeatedly declare their love for each other. And while Victor declares his love for Ilsa, what is her response? A sad and tragic smile. She promises to keep his secret. An intimate tease or a required indulgence?\n\nVictor knew or should have known better. But he was willing to keep her as his emotional support animal anyway, despite knowing \u2014 sure as shit \u2014 that he was separating Ilsa from her true love and separating Rick from his. I wonder if he cared that he was sentencing Ilsa to a life of faked \u2014 and minimal \u2014 affection, of faked enjoyment in their unholy marriage bed.\n\nMaybe her lack of passion didn't bother him so long as he had her devoted admiration, so long as he had that eye candy on his arm? She was the human version of a Birkin. Hell, she didn't even take his surname: She was Ilsa Lund, not Ilsa Laszlo!\n\nPerhaps Victor wasn't the passionate type. We know that Ilsa and Rick sure were. But VICTOR DIDNT CARE. He was sentencing his young wife to a life of pretense and inner turmoil, but he didn't care. What does that say about HIM?\n\nI'll tell what it says: Victor Laszlo is a narcissist intent on saving the world, and he wants to dress the part. Ilsa is the equivalent of the stuffed animal he showers with baby kisses and unreturned embraces during sex. He might as well be fucking a blow-up doll.\n\nOr maybe Ilsa successfully fakes her orgasms, or maybe being able to excite HIM is all he needs from her. In which case, Ilsa is prostituting herself upon the altar of a noble narcissist on a mission from \u2026 who or what? God?\n\nI remember hearing God only twice: once when Rick saves an underage girl from an act of prostitution, and then when he sentences another young woman to a life of prostitution. Both times, it was in the form of \"God bless you, Rick.\"\n\nI REALLY hate Casablanca now, more than ever! I hate how admired it is, how respected in the cinematic pantheon. I'm equally disgusted by the movie and by the people who give it props.\n\nNext on my list \u2014 It's a Wonderful Life. Or is it.",

A lot of things surprised me about the viewing experience as I didn't read about the movie before diving in, most notably that Bogart wasn't as tremendously handsome as I expected having known he sat at the very top of AFI's 50 Greatest Screen Legends of the Golden Age. It was fun picking out the lines I'd heard before in passing as they'd been a part of the zeitgeist ever since, and the movie was as well-made as I expected it to be with its perfect balance of themes. It seems likely that the movie's permanent place among the all-time greats owes at least a bit to its prescient anti-Nazi stance right in the middle of WWII as I'm sure it really hit the spot for viewers when it was first released, but even today I find nothing to really criticize. I didn't find myself completely swept away by the movie, but it's still extremely good. Kudos!",

You can just watch it as a classic love story, or enjoy it even further with rewatches as the subtext becomes apparent. Rick is a sort of metaphor for the US on the eve of entering the war, made more obvious by the film being set in December of 1941. Should Rick pursue his own selfish, immediate interests? Or should he become part of a greater cause, and sacrifice his own desires to help defeat fascism? He never sticks his neck out for anyone- or at least so he claims. By the end he has a great character arc as we discover the real Rick isn't the heartless cynic he tries to portray himself as. Most people my age find it easy to write off films of this era as dated or boring.

There are a ton of characters, and yet somehow, every one of them, with the exception of the Nazis, won me over.  This movie is super heavy on dialog, but unlike modern cinema where characters talk just to fill time, the dialog in \"Casablanca\" feels like it is all in support of the plot, which forces you to hang on every word or else you will get lost.

            "content": "\"TAKES MY BREATH AWAY\" LOVE FILMS\nby Timothy J. Verret\n\nI'm as drawn to love films as a beautiful and majestic horse is drawn to water. I create so much about and from the notion of love that it sometimes is hard for me to take a decent, deep breath. Here are 10 (actually 11) films about love (or the lack thereof) that \"take my breath away\" and heal my still-sometimes-very-broken heart (BOTH!):\n\n1. SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE (1998):\nThis would indeed be my all-time favorite love film because it's got Shakespeare and it's got that message: \"Love is the ONLY inspiration.\" This film is inspired by a great and awe-inspiring love for acting, writing, directing, and how passion engages all of these things in one love film. Even if this film was not an ode to why Shakespeare wrote sonnets in the first place, the scene where Viola is onstage in a staged production of Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET and William is lovingly looking at her from the wings is more than enough of a reason why I adore this love film. Viola loves William, William loves Viola, and the music takes us away to just this one moment of two looks and two smiles all looked and smiled in the name of a beautiful, all-encompassing love. That scene alone \"takes my breath way\" every time I see it. Even though this film is #10 on my all-time favorite films' list, it is solidly #1 on my all-time favorite love films' list (I guess you could say, \"so the last shall be first, and the first shall be last\" [Matthew 20:16]). \ud83d\ude09\n\n2. SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE (1973):\nSwedish director Ingmar Bergman is not known for gushy and silly love films, but this film IS a very serious love film because Bergman gives us both the glory and grime of a marriage dissolving. In true and typical Bergman fashion, each scene of this film is a very serious \"take my breath away,\" because the truth and turmoil at the heart of this marriage ending are about as real as my hand in front of my face. Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as Marianne and Johan give towering performances. I will never forget the scene where Marianne and Johan go to the lawyer's office to sign the divorce papers and literally get into a fist fight. After the fight (and the marriage) is over, they both with their tattered hair and hearts sign the divorce papers. This film is as stunning as it is sacrificial. Marriage IS sacrifice and when that's not there, stunning is any marriage's dissolvement. I probably could have listed a handful of Ingmar Bergman films that explore the theme of this kind of intense love, but I have to keep this list as brief as possible.\ud83d\ude09\n\n3. MARRIAGE STORY (2019):\nVery much like SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE, this film is haunting and often horribly uneasy to sit through. Scarlett Johansson as Nicole and Adam Driver as Charlie give exceptionally riveting performances as a married couple with way too big egos (she is an actress and he is a theatre director and if that's not \"way too big egos,\" I don't know what is). I will never forget the scene where Nicole goes to Charlie's apartment and they are in the throws of so much anger and so much hurt that the walls of Charlie's apartment are about to come down. Johansson's Nicole delivers to Driver's Charlie the line that is THE line where love hoped to save this marriage and love can't save this marriage intersect, \"You're so merged with your own selfishness, you don't even identify it as selfishness anymore!\" That line \"took my breath away\" because I totally identified with it. A marriage on its way to a divorce is all about selfishness unidentified anymore. The proclaimed egos of both partners \"win out\" and when ego \"wins out,\" everything is \"lost in\" a marriage war of two \"way too big egos.\"\n\n4. THE DANISH GIRL (2015):\nIt's so cool that this film is #4 on this list, as #4 is my spiritual number. It's also cool that this film is #4 on my all-time favorite films' list, as well. The story of Gerda and Einar (Lily) Wegener is what love films should always be about: The sacrifice one partner needs to make for a marriage to survive (often times in a marriage, both partners have to make sacrifices). Gerda makes the ultimate sacrifice by accepting that her husband, Einar, believes he is a woman and wants to have an operation to become Lily, the woman he always was on the inside. Anyone else that I can think of in Gerda's position would have said in response to this, \"no way, no how\u2026.this marriage is OVER!\" Gerda loves Einar so much that she is willing to do just about anything (and she does) to keep their love alive. Alicia Vikander (Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actress) is an absolute and complete revelation in her performance as Gerda, and Eddie Redmayne completely and totally seals the deal in his performance in this film to make him my all-time favorite actor next to Joaquin Phoenix. I swear I could go on and on about how this film \"takes my breath away\" at every twist and turn where love is concerned but, once again, I'm needing to be brief here.\ud83d\ude09\n\n5. YENTL (1983):\nVery similar to THE DANISH GIRL, this film is not your conventional love film. It's about a woman who loves this man who thinks a woman is a man, this man who loves another woman who is also a woman but since he can't have this other woman, the man asks a woman to marry this other woman so he can be close to this other woman, and a woman who this man thinks is a man marries this other woman, and if none of that \"takes your breath away,\" I'm not sure what ever would! This film \"takes my breath away\" because it's simply about the lengths and heights and depths we find ourselves reaching for in the throes (or thrown) of love. And because I am a huge Barbra Streisand fan and this is Barbra's best film EVER, I can't think of any other love film that pleases and excites me more than this one. And never mind that it is mainly because of Barbra Streisand and my love for her that helped me to believe that I could ever be someone someday who could love someone someday. Now, that \"takes my breath away.\"\n\n6. WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? (1966):\nWhile most in a million years would never call this film a \"love film,\" I do because it's a film about the absence of love in a marriage, the absence that is SO common in a lot of marriages, and an absence so penetrable that the married couple in this film actually make up that they have a child to keep the marriage bearable. Edward Albee's play and Mike Nichols' film adaptation are what I love most about stories where love has flown the coop (if it was ever in the coop in the first place), i.e., the dissection and probing of the insides of people who are losing their identity because love has become nonexistent while brutality and mean-spiritedness are what's left to exist. Elizabeth Taylor, known for her striking beauty, goes from \"riches to rags\" in her physical beauty and gives us an \"ugly\" Martha, a force of nature who is as forceful as she is vulnerable. Taylor, Best Actress Oscar winner) gives what I consider the very best female performance ever captured on film. Richard Burton as George and George Segal as Nick are also excellent, but it's the other female performance of Sandy Dennis as Honey (Best Supporting Actress Oscar winner) that makes this love film truly one that \"takes my breath away\" every time I see it\u2026.and I've seen it a lot!\ud83d\ude09\n\n7. TESS (1980):\nIf there can be any love film that is truly lovely to look it, it would be this film. Based on Thomas Hardy's classic novel of the same name, Roman Polanski directed this film that makes the novel come breathtakingly and beautifully alive. This film \"takes my breath away\" not just because it's pretty to look at but also because it is rapturous and daring to expose seduction between a man and a woman as actually rape, and how that one act of domination produces shame that stays with the victim. I know that one's shame is to be nailed to The Cross of Jesus but for some, death is the one way, and maybe the only way, to be rid of that shame. Nastassja Kinski as Tess might not be the best actress who ever lived, but Polanksi knew exactly what he was doing by casting her in the title role. Because Kinski was a relative unknown and maybe because Polanski knew she wasn't the greatest actress around, it was precisely these two very things that allowed Kinski to inhabit Tess as bright-eyed innocent, and na\u00efve. A well-known and a great actress would have destroyed these precious traits, so thank God Polanski and Kinski didn't. There's one scene of a closeup of Tess with the brightest yellow sun behind her that to this day, every time I see a sun like that, it \"takes my breath away,\" and I call it, \"the Tess sun.\" LOVE THAT! \u2764\ufe0f\n\n8. THE WAY WE WERE (1973):\nIt certainly makes sense that I would have two Barbra Streisand films on this list but even if I didn't love Streisand, this film would be on it anyway and probably most others' \"love film\" list. It's the ultimate love story of the girl over there and the guy over here and how there and here come together and we are all the better for being present to witness that. The odds are that two beautiful actors like Redford and Streisand couldn't possibly go wrong in a beautiful love film that ends with a closing scene that still \"takes my breath away.\" Streisand's Katie and Redford's Hubbell are looking at each other after having separated when famous Streisand takes that famous hand and famously brushes away that famous hair from Redford's famous face. \"See ya', Katie.\" \"See ya' Hubbell.\" See me balling my eyes out.\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\n\n9. CASABLANCA (1942):\nWhile not the film I would have included on my \"take my breath away\" love films' list, I'm including it because it's on the top of the list for two of my favorite people and because any film with an actor or actress with the last name of \"Bergman\" should be on any film list I compile (see #2 for that \"other Bergman\" film). That said, I have seen this film and I remember loving it very much. Many \"love film\" aficionado's are divided into two camps where this film's ending is concerned: One group wants Rick to let Ilsa board that plane to Lisbon with Laszlo for The Resistance, while the other group says, \"C'mon! Rick and Ilsa forever! We're not talking about The Resistance here! We're talking about love!\" This film reminds us that love doesn't always end as victorious as The Resistance, but what we cannot \"resist\" is that we loved in the first place. That is usually enough for any kind of love to take flight.\n\n10. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (1934) and SOMEWHERE IN TIME (1980):\nI admit I was torn between which of these films to include to round out the top 10 \"take my breath away\" love films, until it dawned on me that both films have something very much in common: The element of time when and where love is lost and/or found. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is simple enough to say love can happen one night, whereas SOMEWHERE IN TIME says one night is fine, but true love cannot be contained by the element of time. Love can happen one night, sure, and then more nights can happen after that, but sometimes you have to go \"somewhere in time\" to find that love again. Whether one night or \"somewhere in time,\" love alters us to our very core and we do search time and space to find it, but there are no guarantees that the Jericho Walls (reference to the ending of IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT) will stay up or come down when love happens in just one night or \"somewhere\" outside of space and time for a lifetime.\n\nNow, I'm not currently in a love relationship (unless you count Jesus) but if I were, my partner would need to have seen AT LEAST one of these films. If not, watching AT LEAST one of these films is essential if any partner who loves me expects to \"take my breath away.\" \ud83d\ude09\u2764\ufe0f",

In World War II, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) owns a cafe/casino in Casablanca, Morocco and obtains secret exit visas to escape Nazi persecution. During which, his ex-lover Ilse (Ingrid Bergman) walks in and they reunite. Ilse asks Rick for favors because she and her husband (Paul Henreid) will die in this city if he doesn't give visas to them. To be honest, within the second Rick glued eyes onto Ilse, I was hooked. Furthermore, I saw more of the despair and regret in both characters as the film continued. Part of the chemistry involves their given circumstances and high stakes, which suggest that she seeks guidance from him before she dies. Despite her desperate needs, Rick drowns himself with so much liquor, hoping to wash away their romance in Paris, that he resents her for quietly departing him. Because of this, you almost feel teary-eyed that he finally agrees to the proposal as well as feel the tremendous connection between the two characters. In case my points weren't an indication, I had a wonderful time watching Casablanca, seeing now why it's considered THE great romance film. \n\n(5 Blue Parrots out of 5)",

Understanding which side to be on and Bergman who is in love and confused but will fight for her husband. My favourite performance was Claude Rains who I was disappointed that he did not receive best supporting actor. He has a wealth of humour and is very commanding. The film is a deserved best picture Oscar winner. The last 10 minutes is one of the best ends to a film in history, from the many great lines, the tension and the acting. Here's looking at you kid and well always have Paris are very emotional. The film has many funny moments and terrific songs throughout. As time goes by is a classic as is the moving scene with the La Marseillaise. No scene is wasted they all play a pivotal role in the film as the many people try to leave Casablanca or help Laszlo. Give much credit to the director and the look of the movie. Ricks looks a terrific place to go and the markets are well designed. The many shadows used through many scenes increase the tension and paranoia. Many of the scenes happen through the evening and night and the film is gorgeous black and white.

From the moment I started watching it when I was 11 years old it became, still is and always will be, one of my all time favorite films, ever. As a matter of fact I had been dating a guy for a couple months when he had come over to watch Casablanca with me, it was the first time ever watching it for him and I was extremely excited. What I wouldn't give to watch Casablanca for the first time, again.  Well, I'm sad to report that after the first 30 minutes he had fallen asleep and even after I woke him, he fell asleep again and for the rest of the movie. I broke up with him 2 days later. I'm not saying that you don't have a soul if you don't like, or love, Casablanca, but I'm not, not saying it, either. If you haven't seen this movie please do yourself a favor and do so.

The first act of this movie has so many characters coming and going, speaking different languages, talking about different things, jumping in and out of scenes. I know it's supposed to set a mood, but it's very difficult to figure out who and what we're supposed to be paying attention to. Bogart moves from one conversation to the next and the audience is left to wonder if it will be of any significance later or if it's just world building, heaven help you if you missed something. Rush over here, have a quick conversation, end it abruptly, then rush on over to the next person to do it over again, like a series of dreams crashing in on one another all at once. There's one hilarious moment where two men are walking into the bar, and one gives the Nazi salute, and the other salutes regularly, then they both look at each other. I get that it's probably an accurate occurrence from those days, but then the movie pauses on that like it's some important moment between the two. Um, I can't tell what denomination the non-Nazi guy is, so I don't know what feeling is supposed to be evoked from this: fear, disgust, quiet camaraderie, sympathy? It struck me as one of the actors realizing they were on the wrong movie set and the editor forgot to leave the clip on the cutting room floor. Oh, and god the mumbling. People give today's mumble rappers a bad reputation, but they have nothing on old black and white films. They did nothing but mumble unless they were screaming. I had to have the volume halfway up just to make out what people were saying. That and Bogart's mouth never fully closes; it strangely got on my nerves just looking at his face. Part of this is my fault. I am not, nor will I ever be, that interested in history, and more specifically WW2, so all this intrigue is lost completely on me because I don't know the intricacies of who is dressed as what, or why this official hates that official, or even why this guy over here can't get along with the others over there (except the Nazis of course, I don't need to be a history buff to get why no one likes them). I just couldn't get why someone would give a guy the side eye, the characters would throw a line away about it, but if you don't know the historical context surrounding this time period, it would make no sense, and then the moment would pass by like it never happened. You don't really need to understand all that to follow the movie, but it really feels like you're missing a ton if you don't. Thank goodness for Ingrid Bergman. Any movie she's in is worth it in the end.",

            "content": "I would not have any real problem with this film if it was acknowledged as an average 1940s melodrama instead of being called one of the greatest films of all time. It simply isn't and I was infuriated at the fact that AFI considers the love between Rick and Ilsa to be better than that Scareltt and Rhett in Gone with the Wind (1939) and Karen and Denys in Out of Africa (1985). I found parts of the film that I liked but I didn't feel involved in the passion in the way that I should have in a big, dramatic love story. I would say that people should watch it because it contains some memorable lines, great cinematography and is mercifully short when compared to other Best Picture winners.\n\nAmerican Rick Blaine, Humphrey Bogart, resides in Casablanca, Morocco where he owns a bar at which illegal gambling takes place and refugees attempt to buy freedom and escape to Lisbon, Portugal. One night his ex-lover Ilsa Lund, Ingrid Bergman, and the husband that he was unaware of when they had an affair while in Paris arrive at Rick's hoping to buy their way to Casablanca. Rick and Ilsa fondly remember the time they spent in Paris while she tries her hardest to get the letters of transit off of him. He eventually relents and allows her to leave with her husband but falls back on his friend, corrupt official Captain Louis Renault, Claude Rains, for lasting friendship.\n\nMy biggest issue with the film is that Ilsa is a big old nothing of a character. What do we know about her personality, she's in love with Rick but trapped with another man and doesn't have the guts to go out and do something on her own. Their connection seems very shallow as we only see a \u2018love montage' in which she happily places flowers in a vase and they stare at one another longingly, what is it about the other that makes them attractive, we never know. We don't get any real moments of tension as I could sense that the two of them were not going to get back together and the time we spend with them in which they discuss their \u2018impossible' situation is not particularly romantic or devastating. Feeling nothing for one of your main characters and not believing in the connection between the two lovers in your film is a bad sign for a romantic drama and this is what sunk the film from being great to just adequate for me.\n\nSome of the lines were undeniably brilliant however as the dialogue is snappy and exciting in a film where very little actually goes on. \"We'll always have Paris\" would have more power if included in a more romantic story but as it stands it was still a lovely sentimental line to drop in amongst more cynical talk. \"Round up the usual suspects\" and \"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\" also deserve their iconic status but they hardly equal \"Frankly me dear, I don't give a damn\" and \"Tomorrow is another day.\" If you watch films looking for quotable lines this is a film packed full of them and they have the intended effect even with age.\n\nThe performances of the two leads are part of why I don't love the film as I feel that Bogart poses more than acts in his position as a romantic lead and Bergman doesn't get enough to work with to be a compelling leading lady. Rains steals the show as Captain Renault as his precise British manner and the touch of melancholy in his voice make his character a worthy ally to our leads and possibly the most interesting character in the film.\n\nThe 1942 Best Picture nominees weren't particularly strong but I would have given the award to Watch on the Rhine (1943) which features one of my favorite Bette Davis performances. No it's not as iconic or well loved as Casablanca but it's a better film that has aged wonderfully despite being made in an era where most films seem like ridiculously overblown soap operas by today's standards. You will most likely see Casablanca at least once during your life but please try to see Watch on the Rhine.",

And I think it is his supervision that blends in sacrifice in romance, so pure and irreplaceable, that drama is overshadowed by its crowd pleasing concept. The director, Michael Curtiz installs tiny notions in the script that carves a momentum of live hotel and the do's and don'ts of a hotelier especially the magnetic reputation he or she juggles by dipping his or her hands on both the side of the dirt.\n\nThe Robin Hood figure, is their way in, and with Humphrey Bogart playing one of the most iconic character, the first act of the film is building up his figure that is latter to be shattered with such fragility. But the final act is brimmed with charm, so where they actually had to work was the introduction. And choreographed like some exotic dance, the entire hotel that is mapped out in front of us, makes us feel like home something that has aged well over the years. Personally, I prefer the sacrifice of his hotel's fairness regarding the gambling policies.\n\nTo me, that would always be the game changer, not only the actress's performance but the tone that shifts with such calculative baby steps that you are sinking in deliberately in those twinkling eyes. And if Bogart is boasting off with some of his best work then Ingrid Bergman definitely casts the magic powerful enough to rubble him down in a blink. Their equation is like some wine, you are buzzed with the aftermath soberness rather than their poetic romantic vacation. Casablanca defines the Hollywood version of Americana set in a different location, it was ahead of its time then and it is now; all hail the classic dish serving one purpose and one only.",

Swift pacing and a short run time makes Casablanca a quick romance that stays with you forever. Clever, witty writing and punchy delivery culminate in fun dialogue and memorable lines. Casablanca really has everything going for it, from a beautiful theme song, moody lighting, stunning black and white stark colors, and stellar casting.\n\nSpeaking of which, Casablanca features a highly unique cast of standout actors. Humphrey Bogart leads Casablanca with a grumpy, moody, disposition. Bogart pulls off sarcastic remarks and dry humor with a manly suave. Ingrid Bergman is as lovely as ever with gorgeous costumes and that distinct Swedish accent. Bergman is Casablanca's real standout performance. She is so expressive and realistic for the era. She portrays charm with ease, while simultaneously playing the mysterious old flame. Bergman is the ultimate femme fatale.\n\nNotably, legend of German cinema from the silent film era, Conrad Veidt plays a German Major in Casablanca. He is quite the villain with his strict German demeanor and heinous manipulation. It's a very nice supporting role from Veidt.\n\nSimilarly, Claude Rains plays a French Captain that is absolutely charming and hilarious. I really liked Rains in Casablanca. He will certainly endear himself to any audience that watches Casablanca.\n\nOverall, this is as iconic and classic as movies get. Casablanca remains a beautiful romance film filled with reveals and twists. It holds up as a well directed movie by Michael Curtiz as well. I think Bogart and Bergman's chemistry is what continues to endear itself to viewers to this day.",

Loved the look of the movie and Ingrid Bergman is just stunning.\n\nOnce I realized Rick's transformation was the main point of the film, I liked it better.   The treatment of Ilsa's character was, for me, just too 1940's Hollywood.   So she tragically loses her husband and falls in love with Rick.  Then, when she finds out her husband is actually alive but Rick is in danger and need to leave Paris, she sacrifices that love to stay with her sick, hero husband and also to protect Rick.   But the film does not see this as heroic.  This is just a plot point to show why Rick is cynical and bitter.   Then they meet again in Casablanca.  Rick can't forgive her, or even let her explain.  He's too deeply wounded because he loved her so much - not enough to hear her out-  but enough to change his whole outlook on life and become cynical. \nHowever, hero husband needs Rick's help which he refuses, (because he is cynical and bitter) even though he agrees that Lazlo is a great and important man.  Ilsa begs Rick for help, calls him out on his punishing Lazlo because he's mad at her and even pulls a gun on him.  Up to this point, this is not a woman who needs Rick to think for her.  She is not weak or morally confused in any way.  She has put aside her love for Rick to support her husband who is fighting the Nazi's while Rick serves them drinks.   However, in this movie, Ilsa's self-sacrifice means nothing - because Rick is to be the hero.  We need to see him transform from selfish and cynical to self-sacrificing and heroic.    So Ilsa conveniently  becomes unable to decide right and wrong: \"Oh Rick, you must think for both of us!\"      Now Rick can be the moral agent, hooray!   He decides FOR her that she must stay with Lazlo (because she is his inspiration - a fitting role for a beautiful woman).  Now her sacrifice has meaning and he can live with it because he got to decide, rather than being dumped.   And now they will \"always have Paris\".    Only now are the Paris memories able to be cherished because Rick gets it now.  I'm thinking  Ilsa probably always \"had Paris\" because she originally made the decision to stay with Lazlo.   But now Rick is the decider - so everything is better.   Rick's the hero.  Ilsa has been guided by him back to where she had already gotten by herself and he hopes that \"someday she'll be able to understand\"  that her husband's work is more important than the \"problems of three little people ( that) don't amount to a hill of beans\".\nGood job, Rick!    Better late than never.\n\nAm I right?",

The story is perfectly crafted, intersecting a love triangle with the crushing pressures of wartime, and It's perfectly told by Director Michael Curtiz, with a flashback, a few surprises, and not a single wasted shot.  Most importantly, the film captures the feeling of those huge moments in life that we'll always remember, where everything in one's life pivots, as well as the pain of love lost.  Bogart holding that note in the rain, the ink beginning to run down as he's urged to get on the train, is later mirrored by him watching the plane disappear into the fog, the signal light reducing to a pinprick, and both moments are incredibly poignant.\n\nThe cast is also outstanding - Bogart and Bergman of course, but also almost all of the supporting characters.  Claude Rains as the Vichy French captain whose loyalties sway in the wind is my personal favorite.  In a sweeping story that could have easily been cloying or corny, there is great realism in characters who are morally ambivalent (Rains, Lorre, and Bogart himself) put next to those who are willing to sacrifice themselves for a good cause, and those bent on taking over the world.  There are many wonderful scenes, and not just those between Bogart and Bergman.  Paul Henreid is great with Bergman too, and the scene where he leads the French ex-pats in singing 'La Marseillaise' to drown out the German officers singing their own patriotic is rousing.  And let's not forget Dooley Wilson, who is so smooth, singing among other things the iconic \"As Time Goes By\".  This film is romantic, gritty, stoic, larger than life, and epic - and one that I never get tired of seeing.",

            "content": "Casablanca is a utopian world, a great metaphor about life that is at once the limbo linking hell to paradise.\n\nIn \"Adaptation\" by Spike Jonze, \"Casablanca\" is referred to as a masterpiece for those who want to study and create a screenplay, the consideration is made by screenwriter Robert McKee (Brian Cox), and without a doubt: it is.\n\nThe 1942 classic directed by Michael Curtiz, goes through the centuries as the reference of the seventh art, mainly for the development of its history, an exquisite script that follows the classic linear structure (beginning, middle and end), and who knows how to take advantage of it To provoke small breaks in linearity, in developing a dramatic history whose past we do not know but which is a fundamental part that interferes with the decisions and characteristics of a character, and an uncertain future, but with clear possibilities. We know the paths available to the protagonists, but which will be the chosen and the reason, this only know at the end of the film. The script is based on the play \"Everybody Comes To Rick's,\" being developed in three hands, by Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koc. A curiosity is that the text of the piece only got to be mounted (years) later, and the rights to the cinema was one of the highest values ??paid at the time.\n\n\"Casablanca\" begins with an ironic narration, close to the comedies that parody wars, and at different moments we have this jocular air in the dialogues of the personages, such as Richard Blane (Humphrey Bogart ) That satirizes its condition of abandoned man or of the transitory condition and of waiting of the great room of connections that is the \"airport Casablanca\". However, the script makes the slide precisely by wanting to present the external world through flash black, a feature that does not add anything interesting to the film, but is an easy way out to try to clarify important facts of the past, yet something that a script So bright and a precise direction, could have solved with other means.\n\nA thriving feature used to compose the illumination of the film is the idea of ??a lantern of a lighthouse, which reflects its turn throughout that city, although spatially speaking, the light of this lighthouse reveals that Casablanca is as short as the extension between two open arms , But it is clear the proposal of director Michael Curtiz that with the direction of photography of Arthur Edeson, create an atmosphere of occultism, and that as the characters, we only have vestiges of shadows, they are not clear, as the lapses of illumination , Which little by little reveals something. Another point that contributes to the illumination and photography adopted is the total superficiality employed. We are in a city in Morocco, where sunlight is strong and abundant, but as \"Casablanca\" was shot in the studio, and also proposes the features of a Superficial city, its illumination is composed of lamps, chandeliers, lamps, glares and lighthouses and rarely we have reflections of the sun. This artificiality is also felt in the direction of art performed by Carl Jules Weyl, who in what would be internal and external scenarios, works with very definite oppositions, in the internal environments we have the richness of details, as in the bar \"Ricks Caf\u00e9 American\" or \" Club Owner Signor Ferrari \"in these environments everything is very luxurious and grandiose and well explored in open plans or the close detail minutiae revealing a beautiful work of composition of images and Mise en sc\u00e8ne.\n\nThe soundtrack is marked by the classic \"Like the Time Goes By\" and La Marseillaise, the national anthem of France. Both gain \"status\" in addition to soundtrack, become \"leitmotiv\", and generating some uneasiness, in the third strand of La Marseillaise more than to know that the French are there or that it is a quest to praise France, we know that It is an insecurity on the part of the director to clarify points that are already established as local skin frequented or by the uniforms used by the characters (eg differentiate German soldiers from the French). But the apex of exaltation of the national anthem of France occurs when it is used to provoke the Germans, capable even of uniting the French who are in the Rick caf\u00e9 and under German rule.\n\nHumphrey Bogart as Richard Blane, Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund Laszlo and Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, stand out individually, and the alien origin of each actor favors the clandestine and migratory game inherent in the film. If separately each actor stands out, the combination in a love triangle works even more, and greatly divides the viewer to the loveable favoritism of Ilsa's character, for both the charming Blane and the heroic Victor are charismatic and with divergent qualities, but Together only complicate yet another position that helps in determining who Ilsa should stay with. None of these characters fall on a Manichean scale to the bad side. Some are cynical, some lie, some kill",

The film is essentially described as a romance, but it covers so much more than that. There are comedy elements, usually provided by Claude Rains, the war element, which is the backdrop for the film, and drama, which is probably the main genre challenging the romance.\n\nAll the actors give on-point performances, my particular favourites were Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains, especially their scenes together. The comedy element provided these two balanced out the romance and drama perfectly. My favourite line; \"I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here!\" (Croupier hands him his money)...\"Your winnings sir.\"...\"Oh, thank you very much!\"\n\nThe one drawback I had with the film, was the confusing nature surrounding the letters of transit, but otherwise it is a fantastic film with many memorable lines such as; \"We'll always have Paris\", \"Here's looking at you kid\", \"Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine\" and \"I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\".

This movie of course is brilliant it had excellent choreographed dance sequences, excellent directing, and one of the best plots to have ever put to the big screen. What makes this movie so special is how the romance is handled by the excellent directing of Michael Curtiz, he manages to put suspense, humour, romance in a perfect way.

Despite being over 70 years old it's still the absolute essence of the most romantic era in film history. It's daunting, really, how much of an achievement it is, just how wonderfully every element works on its own, and how each one improves the others when they're combined. Like the perfect cocktail mix of story, screenplay and character, Casablanca hits all the right notes, utilising the very few sets at its disposable to tell a riveting story of love, loss, sacrifice and loyalty against a war-torn backdrop which you feel in every frame. Humphrey Bogart, never a better choice for a self-loathing cynic, is perfect in the iconic Rick Blaine role: Grumpy, downtrodden and well beyond caring, it takes none other than old flame Ilsa, an equally perfect Ingrid Bergman, forsaking all the world's other gin joints and walking straight into his. The 2 have near-unparalleled chemistry, despite allegedly not getting on behind the scenes, and the raw emotionality of their scenes together is nothing if not heart-breaking, and its impossible not to crack a smile whenever Bogart utters the immortal line 'Here's looking at you kid.' They're bolstered by a terrific supporting cast, a beautifully intimate soundtrack and possibly the greatest script in history. When a single screenplay has not 1, not 2, not 3 but 6 quotations appearing on AFI's 100 years...100 Movies Quotes list, it's quality can be in no doubt. It may be a little too verbose in places, but rarely have character's innermost feelings and desires been expressed with such elegance and humour. It's never boring, keeps us guessing right until the end and climaxes with one of the most genuinely touching and memorable scenes ever committed to film. It's hard to know what else needs to be said. Casablanca is likely as close to a perfect film than has ever, or will ever, be made. Its brilliance is undisputed, it's legacy is assured. For those who dare to doubt the true power of cinema, spend a little time at Rick's Caf\u00e9 Am\u00e9ricain, and all reservations will be swiftly forgotten.",

A more satisfying ending would have been for Rick and Ilsa to have remained together at the end. I realize the whatever movie board might not have allowed a married woman to run off with a married man. But that wouldn't be an issue if Lazlo were killed in Casablanca. Also, I think even the Catholic Church would have granted them an annulment, as Ilsa was a young child whose admiration and fascination for Lazlo were mistaken for love, insufficient grounds for a true marriage. Most importantly, Rick and Ilsa had a passionate love that perhaps few are privileged to experience. Just compare the scenes where Rick and Ilsa are together to the Lazlo-Ilsa scenes. R-I scenes are FAR more passionate. I don't even recall a kiss between L and I. Lazlo's passion is defeat of the Axis powers. His love for Ilsa, if he really loves her, is at best secondary to his love of his position with the r\u00e9sistance. So put Lazlo on the plane, let Rick sell the other transit ticket for a fortune, and let Rick and Ilsa live happily ever after. How? Wait for the sequel. And no one will feel sorry for Lazlo. He's embraced his passion. And now Rick and Ilsa  can embrace each other. Forever.\n\nLouis: Bill, I always suspected you were a sentimentalist at heart.",

I could go through so many such as The Godfather, Gone with the wind, Citizen Kane, Psycho among others but one that is one every list is Casablanca. This 1942 flick is one of the earliest films to feature superstar leads. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman were some of Hollywood's elite, A listers to be exact. Here they star in a film that was incredible relevant to the times back then and proved to be a spectacularly well done feature.\n\tthe legendary actors play Rick Blaine (Bogart) and Ilsa Lund (Bergman) two lovers set in the backdrop of Casablanca, Morocco during World War II. Rick owns a nighclub in the city. Rick remains neutral to all war matters going on but however it's discovered he once was an arms dealer for Ethiopia during their war against Italy. Many Generals and politicians come by his place but the most surprising guest is his former lover Ilsa whom he still has feelings for. The two of them get caught up in major political/military scandal that will leave dire consequences for any involved.\nIt was seemingly ahead of its time in terms of filmmaking and story telling. Everything is on a serious scale. the acting is incredible here and the dialogue is so witty!. a trademark of the time but still really solid stuff. the music was really terrific.\nIngrid bergman was reeeeally gorgeous back then even though she was in black and white. she was fantastic here in this role Humphery bogart is amazing here as rick blaine. he is a real complex man in this role but also a smooth hard boiled one as well. very complex love story here between Ilsa and rick. \nMichael curtiz directing is textbook here. so many great shot angles and directing of the overall story and he does it at such a high level. only thing was I didn't know and still don't know what \"here's looking at you kid\" means. however I did like the \"I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\" line.\nthis is a classic film and my favorite now of the 1940's",

Unsurpassed screenplay (maybe it glosses over developments too quickly, which is why I subtracted half a star).Bogart holds it all together and was never better. Set in Dec.1941 and released in 1942, just as America entered the war, yet it seems to capture wartime perfectly. It captures that combination of tension, desperation, romance and sacrifice magnificently. \nOnly other criticism is a personal dislike of music being used too obviously to manipulate the audience's response. I noticed it at times.\nSPOILER ALERT why I wrote that it glosses over developments too quickly, is that I felt Rick's change of conviction is rushed, as is Ilsa's acceptance of Rick's decision that he is staying in Casablanca and she has to go with Laszlo. I find it hard to believe she would have been comfortable leaving it up to Rick to tell her husband she was leaving him. And her decision not to meet him at the train station in Paris (after she learns her husband is still alive) because she believed Rick wouldn't leave Paris without her - well, to be kind to her I guess she believed Rick would get over her in time and didn't need to know she was married  (I realise Laszlo wanted to keep their marriage a secret to protect her but I think Rick in the circumstances could have been told).. I criticise how the screenplay provides character motivation at times, but because the movie never loses tension the screenplay masterfully hides any failures.\n It all passes in a whirl and the movie is over before you know it. \nMaybe I should give it a 5!\nP.S. Only reference to Hitler is a portrait in Strasser's office and he is never mentioned in the film at all\nAn interesting approach to the film is to look at it as Rick's ultimate revenge on Ilsa for deserting him in Paris. He really deserts her at the end, she has no choice but to go with Laszlo. Rick could have got a letter of transit from Ferrari at the Blue Parrott - Ferrari had offered one to Laszlo and Ilsa but they had turned it down because they wanted to leave together. It seems incredible looking back that Ilsa was willing to leave her husband behind in Casablanca to fly off to Lisbon with Rick. And it was really only Rick who forced her hand to leave with her husband.",

Fortunately, in Casablanca Bogart has turned down a little the frothing at the mouth, rabid dog, acting style that he used to bulldoze his way to the top of the Hollywood heap. I do not think Casablanca is the bench mark movie that most people think it is. My interest in it was purely as it is a historical record of movie making in the '30's and '40's. Bogart isn't alone in the bad acting field here, there's Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall, Sydney Greenstreet, the list goes on and on of horrible film performances. I don't think any serious playwright ever tried to recruit any of these actresses and actors to appear in their plays, not because of their unapproachability but because of their unsuitability.That pretty much says it all.",

            "content": "\"Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.\"\n\nThis is another personal favorite of mine and perhaps one of the most quotable classic films of all time. Directed by Michael Curtiz, Casablanca takes place during the early days of World War II in French Morocco where many European refugees were searching for a way to escape to the Americas and evade Nazi control. In Casablanca we are quickly introduced to the owner of a nightclub, an American expatriate named Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Rick is a bitter and cynical man who has decided to look out for himself and offer his clients a good time at his club. But when a man shows up and gives Rick a couple of transit letters that will allow the holder of these papers to travel freely through Europe in order to escape to the United States from Lisbon, they know they can make a lot of money by finding the right buyer. A married couple show up at Rick's bar to buy the letters and this is where we discover why Rick is so bitter. Victor's (Paul Henreid) wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), had met Rick in Paris a while back when she thought her husband, a resistance leader, had been killed during the War. The two had an affair, but when Ilsa discovered that Victor was alive and that he had escaped the Nazi concentration camp where he was held she leaves Rick without giving him any explanation. Rick has never been able to get over the betrayal and seeing her at his joint with her husband makes him even more bitter. And so the adventure begins as Rick must decide if he wants to help Victor and Ilsa escape from the Nazis or if he should simply look the other way. Claude Rains has a supporting role as a corrupt French official while Conrad Veldt plays a Nazi Major.\n\nToday we all praise the screenwriters for this film, but there was much skepticism during filming. Neither Bergman nor Bogart thought it was any good and some claim that they didn't want to work together. I don't think Michael Curtiz ever imagined this film would become such a beloved classic either, but somehow the film clicked in all cylinders and the story has stuck with audiences ever since. The on screen chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is the main reason why the romance works so well and the scenes they ask Sam to play their song on his piano is memorable. It's the best romantic film of all time in my opinion because it has it all: romance, betrayal, and sacrificial love. There are so many beloved quotes in this film and it only gets better over time. The ending is also one of the best in any movie and one of the reasons why so many consider this such a revered classic, but I can point out several other emotional moments such as the scene where Sam is ordered to play a German patriotic song for the Nazi soldiers in the bar, only to have Victor respond by asking the band leader to play La Marseillaise and drown out the song from the Germans. Even the revelation scene where we get flashbacks of Rick and Ilsa's affair and discover how she never meets up with him at the train station and instead he's handed a farewell note from her, is quite emotionally engaging. The film offers plenty of thrilling scenes as well for those that aren't interested in the romance so there is no excuse for anyone not to see this classic. In case you forget how brilliant the screenplay is let me just remind you of some of the best quotes in this movie.\n\n\"Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\"\n\"If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.\"\n\"We'll always have Paris.\"\n\"Here's looking at you kid.\"\n\"Play it, Sam. Play \"As Time Goes By.\"\"\n\"I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.\"\n\"Alright, I'll make it easier for you- Go ahead and shoot. You'll be doing me a favor.\"\n\"Round up the usual suspects.\"\n\"Mostly I remember the last one. The wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look in his face because his insides have been kicked out.\"\n\"It doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world\"\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",
