    "summary": "Now that Chris and his girlfriend, Rose, have reached the meet-the-parents milestone of dating, she invites him for a weekend getaway with Missy and Dean. At first, Chris reads the family's overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries leads him to a truth that he never could have imagined.",

            "content": "The storyline was gripping and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. The themes explored in the movie, such as racism and social commentary, were very relevant and thought-provoking. The acting was also superb, especially by the lead actor Daniel Kaluuya. His portrayal of the main character's emotional journey was truly impressive.\n\nThe cinematography and editing were also very well done. The use of colors and camera angles added to the overall mood and atmosphere of the film. The pacing of the movie was just right, not too slow or too fast, and the suspenseful scenes were executed with great precision.\n\nOverall, \"Get Out\" is a must-see movie that will leave you thinking long after it's over. It's a great example of how horror films can be used to explore deeper social issues, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good thriller.",

            "content": "Horror tension, mystery tension and racial tension blend together into a gripping and formidable nail-biter in \"Get Out,\" the astonishing directorial debut of Jordan Peele. The former half of the comedy duo \"Key & Peele\" has found a way to both honor and subvert the thriller and horror genres in a way that's unmistakably modern.\n\nIn the tradition of \"The Stepford Wives\" with the twist of \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?,\" the story follows a young black man named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) who goes to meet his girlfriend, Rose's (Allison Williams) parents at their fancy estate where things go from slightly uncomfortable in terms of Chris being black to deeply messed up in one slow but inevitable fell swoop.\n\nWith a creepy opening scene showing a different black man getting abducted in a peaceful-seeming suburb, the tone is set immediately that there's cause for concern. Luckily for Chris, Rose is really sensitive to issues of race and prejudice, and even when her parents (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) or brother (Caleb Landry Jones) seem to make Chris' blackness into a thing, the two handle it as best as any interracial couple could. The warning signs come in the form of the Armitage family's black help, maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and groundskeeper Walter (Marcus Henderson), whose behavior is anything but normal.\n\nPeele sets a tone of creepiness largely with the help of composer Michael Abels, also making his feature film debut. The unpredictable nature of Georgina and Walter as characters, the ever-increasing suspicion of all the white characters and the way Peele keeps you nervous about who or what is just outside the frame fuel the fear and paranoia as well as if not better than any horror movie featuring more overtly malevolent forces does.\n\nKaluuya, in a role that will deservedly put him on the map, gives a performance that will connect with viewers who identify with Chris as a man trying to feel comfortable while out of his element experiencing strange things, and those who truly understand Chris' experience as a man of color undergoing the very same events. It would be fascinating to know the different ways a black viewer would experience the film compared to a white one, but the most important thing is that everyone will identify with and feel for Chris.\n\nWhen a little horror film debut like this one gets talents such as Whitford, Keener and Williams, you know the script is good. Peele keeps up the air of mystery a long time even without packing in very many unexpected twists. The awareness of something being wrong but not quite understanding what it going on or why despite getting new information is a real strength of Peele's writing. Then of course there's the brilliant ways that race and the black experience make it into the film. If that weren't enough, Chris' best friend (LilRel Howry) provides comic relief in a way that's stereotypical, yet Peele uses him in unexpected ways. So we get to benefit from Peele's nose for comedy as well.\n\nNot everything adds up by the end of \"Get Out,\" but the film plays out in extremely satisfying fashion. Fans of horror and fans of thrillers who don't mind horror when it's done well should both enjoy the technique and experience. It provides thrills of the pulse-pounding, thrill-seeking and thought-provoking variety and few genre films can say the same.",

            "content": "(Spoilers) Jordan Peele's superb sci-fi thriller is a clever black variation on the Stepford Wives.  Instead of women being replaced by imposter-robots, we have an evil cult of white people, living in Connecticut, who lure black people into their social circle.  Then they drug them; subdue them; and then implant their white brains into the young, strong, healthy black bodies.  It's not hard to read the metaphor here: Peele is criticizing white appropriation of black culture; and white exploitation of the black community as a whole.  I'd say this Stepford Wives remake is actually much better than the original.  Ira Levin's 70s feminist thriller was a bit of a one trick pony.  It played it's hand early, and stayed with it's simple plot to the end.  And it had an ugly heavy-handed finale; where Katherine Ross is destroyed by the evil Stepford Husbands and is turned into a Fembot, with all her friends similarly destroyed.  The ending was so dark it caused many feminists to misread the story as misogynistic.  This was not what Levin intended; he was trying to do a feminist version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers; which decried women's subjugation to patriarchal culture; not celebrated it.  Peele on the other hand keeps you guessing; the plot is more twisty and unpredictable; and he doesn't kill off his hero just to make some point.  (That would have ruined the ending). It's also quite funny.  (Not surprising since Peele is one half of the famous Key and Peele comedy team).  This movie is very entertaining; thrilling, and fun; and it makes nice points about exploitation and cultural appropriation without getting bogged down in its own politics and getting ugly.  It's also nice to see a movie which is in some ways a return to the serious and socially-conscious sci-fi films of the 60s and 70s: Rosemary's Baby, A Clockwork Orange, The Twilight Zone; Planet of the Apes; Soylent Green; these were all Sci-Fi shows and movies which had a point; which had a strong political message attached.  They had some strong criticism of social trends in our culture; or man's foibles in general; or contained observations and lessons about culture and society.  Somewhere along the line; about the time Star Wars came out; sci-fi dropped it's serious and political bent and became mindless escapism; and that was a huge loss.  Hopefully Get Out represents a reversal of that trend.",

As challenging as it was for its time, it comes across as positively cosy compared with this movie. Get Out delves much deeper into the innate racism that most people have built into their psyche. It is a genuinely disturbing movie: as much a psychological thriller as a horror, set in rural isolation, away from the safety of a more accepting, multicultural city. On the surface, everything seems innocent enough, but \u2026 The disturbing, nonconsensual psychotherapy scene alone should be enough to unsettle anyone. From the strange behaviour of the black help to the uncertainties feared by the boyfriend, with nods to various class and racial stereotyping, no matter how broadmindedly hip you think you are, this should have you questioning your own thoughts and attitudes towards race, and mixed race relationships. This is one movie that pushes aside any notion of coziness to challenge the subject at every level, no matter what race or class you happen to be.",

Add to that a very promising trailer, the award nominations and wins and mostly positive word of mouth (even with the very vocal detractors), and interest was higher.\n\nHigh expectations were not only met but also exceeded. Apologies for the clich\u00e9, but to me that is the best way to sum up my personal experience watching 'Get Out'. Can totally see why it was as well received as it was, though can also see why it has divided audiences on here. While it will never be one of my favourite films, 'Get Out' is among the better films of 2017 and does live up to the hype.\n\nIt's an incredibly well-made film visually, with stylish and unsettling cinematography and editing and some disturbingly surreal imagery that adds to, and enhances, the unease and sense of dread.\n\nThat the direction was done by a first-time director is a shock in itself, one of the most outstanding debut directing jobs seen in a long time by me. It's nostalgic in its embracing of contemporary and classic horror and also brave in the accomplished handling of the film's combative themes.\n\nBeing somebody who considers music important when talking about it, the music looms suitably ominously and fits well. 'Get Out' benefits from an extremely smart and clever script (though 'The Shape of Water' and especially 'Lady Bird' were worthier wins for the Best Original Screenplay Oscar in my view), that takes on a lot of elements and balances them adeptly and the individual elements handled very effectively.\n\nDespite how it sounds, 'Get Out' struck me as more of a thriller with horror and comedic elements. It is highly successful on this front, with the thriller elements being taut, suspenseful and unsettling, the comedic ones being darkly funny and clever and the horror ones being imaginatively shocking and subtly uneasy. There is even some social commentary and interracial themes explored, and done thoughtfully and just about avoids preachiness while hitting hard still.\n\nWhile all the performances are very fine, it is Daniel Kaluuya's superb lead performance that burns in the memory the most.\n\nMy only complaint of 'Get Out' is the too pat and somewhat silly ending that felt tacked on and like it came out of a different film, to me it too ended on a tonally jarring and that's it note.\n\nUntil then, the film was this close to being a masterpiece. So it was frustrating that it just missed out on that distinction. Nonetheless it's a great film that is among the year's better ones, brought down by an underwhelming ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Que se hace m\u00e1s evidente en ciertas escenas, como la presentaci\u00f3n de la fiesta donde Chris se siente inc\u00f3modo por no sentirse perteneciente a ella y que se evidencia m\u00e1s con los prejuicios internos de todos los invitados hacia el y que culmina de una gran manera con la frase de \"No es lo que dices si no como lo dices\", esa escena t\u00e9cnicamente es perfecta, ya que en ella se expone el conflicto interno de la pel\u00edcula y se establece el suspenso de la misma; Que gracias al espectacular soundtrack de Michael Abels introduce muy bien al espectador a la agon\u00eda de la casa y al encierro de la misma, que por varios momentos llega a ser estresante, conectado muy bien con la gran actuaci\u00f3n de Daniel Kaluuya, (que m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del meme), la escena de la primera hipnotizaci\u00f3n es brillante ya que espec\u00edficamente en esa escena demuestra todo su nivel actoral, demostrando la agon\u00eda y la incertidumbre del ambiente en el que est\u00e1 involucrado, manteniendo y entendiendo cada escena y como su personaje desde su POV reacciona a las circunstancias, armando el rompecabezas con el espectador. Si tuviera que decir algo que no me encant\u00f3 de la pel\u00edcula ser\u00eda que por momentos Jordan Peele llega a ser un poco sobre explicativo para que a todos los espectadores les quede claro en conflicto y ciertas met\u00e1foras puntuales de la pel\u00edcula, que aunque no est\u00e1 mal si llega a conducir a algunos di\u00e1logos forzados.  \n\nJordan Peele y su equipo hacen un trabajo brillante, supieron como construir un mensaje que sin sentirse forzado logra ser efectivo, ya que ataca a la sutilidad, como la escena en la que se presenta el personaje de Andre y a su esposa, que bien podr\u00eda representar como la gente moldea a las personas y que inconscientemente los aleja de sus ra\u00edces. O la escena en la que el personaje de Rod va con la polic\u00eda, que para mi representa como la pol\u00edcia no ataca los problemas de toda la gente por igual desacreditando la versi\u00f3n de ciertas personas por como se ven. Get Out, es una cr\u00edtica sobre el racismo que con tintes surrealistas cuentan una historia que te har\u00e1 estar al filo del asiento en toda la pel\u00edcula, que en su narrativa logra sentirse aut\u00e9ntica. Todos los involucrados regalan un trabajo t\u00e9cnicamente perfecto para que te sientas estresado y pendiente en cada detalle de la misma.",

Its a difficult film to categorise but its certainly eery and unsettling and it does have an atmospheric feel to it. \n\nIt was clear to me that its about racism but not direct racism, not obvious racial slurs as such but about a sort of swept under the carpet form of racism, a sub-conscious kind of it - its hard to explain. It has almost a Hitchcockian feel, with the main character seeming to be made to feel uncomfortable and unwelcome but if he were to say this outloud as such and challenge it, it would be hard to explain precisely why he felt that way. It really is one of those films that you have to see and make your own mind about, I suppose. There is a decent amount of suspense and certainly a heavy dose of tension brewing under the surface, as it were, although if you break it down, for most of the duration the physical things going on aren't necessarily, on their own, that worrying. It could be said that paranoia is at play but I certainly found myself feeling concerned and unsure, as Chris did.\n\nI did feel that the music was, at times, a little over the top, a bit obvious perhaps but I wouldn't say its too big an issue. Its a good film and I'd recommend it if your interested in it, as long as your not hoping for an all out slasher fest type watch.",

A total fresh take with original story, this movie is interwined with foreshadowing through and through. Everything in it has a purpose, there's a foundation for all that happens. Peele serves the audience a not-so-usual-in-media view on racism through satire with chilling horror elements, which leave you feeling unsettled more than anything. This film doesn't tackle the theme of racism in the classic 'republican' way, just for the sake of checking a box for a character development. It rather focuses on the \"passive\" racism from 'liberal democrats', which isn't a typical on-screen portray we would see often. It's good to see a piece of media that portrays the reality of those experiences, rather than just traumatize the character with no intention of further plot or actual representation. At the very end, let's not overlook the spectacular casting; Daniel Kaluuya and the way he can act through his eyes should be studied.

It's lovely to see inquisitive, competent protagonists that try to learn more and then want to bail once they feel they've put enough of the pieces together. Tying in Chris' backstory with the Sunken Place was absolutely masterful, and is what pushed this into 5 star territory. He sat by doing nothing, watching a TV screen, as his mother lay dying from the hit and run. And in the Sunken Place, where he can't move or speak (where he can do nothing), the only image of the outside world is through a shrunken film frame that looks just like a TV screen would. So good.

From beginning to end the story bumbles along the all-too-tread road of white = bad, black = innocent and \"trapped.\" It is a tale that has been told 1,000 times in the last 50 years.  And because it is such condescendingly low-hanging fruit I pretty much anticipated a resounding cheer from our black countrymen. What I did not expect was the bandwagon response amongst all other ethnicities. My continued surprise is derived from the fact that, as a whole, \"Get Out\" is simply not a very good film, let alone a good horror film. \nAs a lifelong horror fan, I expect the unexpected; the \"different\" when it comes to highly anticipated \"must-sees.\" There are multiple sub-genres of horror with no boundaries, making horror a somewhat easy category for up-and-coming directors to try something new and daring. Thus, it should have been even easier from someone with the industry ties Mr. Peele enjoyed prior to this debut to really stretch the limits of this malleable genre. Yet this film offered neither the new nor the daring. It was a bland, uncooked potato topped with a so-called plot-twist involving one of the single most overused suspense tropes aside from amnesia. Once this was revealed as the culprit, my eyes rolled so wildly I almost fell into the seat next to me. An already boring movie became not only incredibly corny, but almost intolerable from that moment forward. The \"a-ha\" moment is about as fresh as the breadcrumbs in the bottom of my toaster. \nFinally, I find it incredibly problematic that, as a half-white/half-black man, time and again Mr. Peele consistently falls to only one end of his family history. His identity seems almost consumed by his blackness. I often wonder how the white side of his family feels about his continued contempt, belittling, condemnation, and razzing of their heritage, their culture. We get it, Mr. Peele: you have black ancestry. But you also have just as much white ancestry. Why, then, this deep-seeded need for your repeated, almost labored, reassertion that blacks be at the forefront of your films when you have the ability to simply make films with \"people\" in them?\nBut if you must continue to make films with black main characters, whether for street-cred or because of some identity conflict, I only ask that you please write something more ground-breaking.",

So much for nail-biting horror. \ud83d\ude44 \n\nThe core concept doesn't even sell or make sense. I like body horror fine, and it can be completely ridiculous and over the top - like Reanimator, or a Cronenberg offering - but you have to sustain some coherence and a consistent world, and at least _somewhat_ maintain believability, within the construct.  I guess maybe \"some\" percentage of the population walks around this paranoid, and \"horrifically\" \"buys\" the premise that most of the the world is actually out to get them, and snatch them for [\"spoiler\" \ud83d\ude44]. But this take just doesn't sell for me. \n\nI think some aspects were trying to split the horror/comedy gap - like a Simon Pegg & Nick Frost offering, without their  successful timing & execution.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Add to that a very promising trailer, the award nominations and wins and mostly positive word of mouth (even with the very vocal detractors), and interest was higher.\n\nHigh expectations were not only met but also exceeded. Apologies for the clich\u00e9, but to me that is the best way to sum up my personal experience watching 'Get Out'. Can totally see why it was as well received as it was, though can also see why it has divided audiences on here. While it will never be one of my favourite films, 'Get Out' is among the better films of 2017 and does live up to the hype.\n\nIt's an incredibly well-made film visually, with stylish and unsettling cinematography and editing and some disturbingly surreal imagery that adds to, and enhances, the unease and sense of dread.\n\nThat the direction was done by a first-time director is a shock in itself, one of the most outstanding debut directing jobs seen in a long time by me. It's nostalgic in its embracing of contemporary and classic horror and also brave in the accomplished handling of the film's combative themes.\n\nBeing somebody who considers music important when talking about it, the music looms suitably ominously and fits well. 'Get Out' benefits from an extremely smart and clever script (though 'The Shape of Water' and especially 'Lady Bird' were worthier wins for the Best Original Screenplay Oscar in my view), that takes on a lot of elements and balances them adeptly and the individual elements handled very effectively.\n\nDespite how it sounds, 'Get Out' struck me as more of a thriller with horror and comedic elements. It is highly successful on this front, with the thriller elements being taut, suspenseful and unsettling, the comedic ones being darkly funny and clever and the horror ones being imaginatively shocking and subtly uneasy. There is even some social commentary and interracial themes explored, and done thoughtfully and just about avoids preachiness while hitting hard still.\n\nWhile all the performances are very fine, it is Daniel Kaluuya's superb lead performance that burns in the memory the most.\n\nMy only complaint of 'Get Out' is the too pat and somewhat silly ending that felt tacked on and like it came out of a different film, to me it too ended on a tonally jarring and that's it note.\n\nUntil then, the film was this close to being a masterpiece. So it was frustrating that it just missed out on that distinction. Nonetheless it's a great film that is among the year's better ones, brought down by an underwhelming ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Finally, I was able to guess everything that was happening in this movie well before it was revealed.

It's listed on this site as the 2nd best horror film of all time - you've got to be kidding. The fact that it is, I suppose, afro-centric, should be neither here nor there. Even thinking of it in those terms is intrinsically racist - it's good because it's good, that's all that should matter. It isn't great - it's let down by its final act - & that's without the imbecilic alternate ending in which apparently, in the face of all, you know, readily available evidence, the police are just automatically going to arrest the black guy. Is that what happens? Really? Do you really think that's how justice works in the U.S.? Ironically, despite ridiculous tags like 'subversive', the film squibs on why black men (& woman) are the targets. Would have been a better film if it hadn't, then it might have been saying more than it actually does, but it still wouldn't have been subversive. That's infantile. The reality is that a lot of the people who are over the top about the import of this one are in effect patting the black guy on the head & telling him how clever he is. The actual film itself is irrelevant. If you look at the actual film though, rather than the colour of the skin of the person who made it - it's a high quality effort that I highly recommend, despite that fact that it runs out of ideas at the end & just settles on killing everybody. It is absolutely in the top 10-20 horror films of the 21st Century. It is not by any stretch of the imagination, the 2nd best horror film of all time.",

It does what other movies are too scared to do which is to address race and makes it the focal point of the film. For some odd reason, Jordan Peele starts off the movie with an unnamed black character who is knocked out in the middle of the night and kidnapped by a person in a white car. Instead of the continuation of this scene, we are introduced to an African American photographer named Chris Washington and his Caucasian girlfriend Rose Armitage. We find out that the two of them are going to Rose's family since she wants to introduce them to Chris. Next, Chris asks Rose \"does your family know I'm black\" in which Rose hesitantly responds with \"n-no\". Jordan Peele ingeniously introduces two points of racial tension at the beginning of the film that makes the viewer bite at their nails with anticipation knowing full well that Chris will be facing exactly what he fears most at the Armitage house. We are then revealed to the white mother, father, and brother of the Armitage family and their two black employed servants. The juxtaposition of the races and roles of the Armitage family and their servants clearly convey the theme of racial inequality. Later, the Armitage host a party with mostly old white attendants and 1 black one. The white guests repeated uncomfortable praises of the black race and the weird behaviors of the only other 3 black people make both Chris and the viewer think that he is the odd one out. The consistent strange behaviors of the people at the party and Rose's indifference to this really generates the idea that something is seriously wrong. This feeling of unease hits its climax when 1 of the black guests has a nosebleed and yells at Chris to get out after a flash picture was taken of him. Overall, Get Out is a well-put-together movie that explores the fears of the African American population through an entertaining and gut-wrenching horror movie. The continuous rise of tension does a splendid job at symbolizing the fear that black people feel in a America that is at some times, unwelcoming to them. The contrast between race and job also does a good job at reflecting the economic inequalities faced in modern America. Now the movie is not free without its flaws. The action scenes don't seem realistic at all, especially not with that cheap and bright red CGI blood. Also, the existence of Rose's stack of photos feels like it was thrown in there to further the plot as there was no good reason given as to why Rose would have these photos and kept them in the place she did. Nevertheless, Jordan Peele's brilliant script and all of the actors' amazing acting really sell the pitch of Get Out. That the lives of black people in America can sometimes feel like something straight out of a horror movie.",

In a world where jump scares and ominous soundtracks are all that comprise the horror genre, this movie was a delightful change of pace. From the suspense and character development, to the underlying themes of oppressions and inequality, this movie is easily one of the best movies of 2017. I went into this movie without hearing any reviews or knowing the plot and honestly I am glad for it. It is one of those movies that you can't really describe without ruining some of the suspense and mystery. Captivating is the best word I could use to describe this film.",

            "content": "Get Out is a very clever, smart and effective horror movie. The writing and directing are superb and manage to deliver a movie with some interesting racial undertones. Peele actually uses these undertones to complement the horror in this movie and try to work around the obvious cliches and stereotypes that are present from the very beginning. The acting supplements this beautifully by leaving no ambiguity regarding those stereotypes and cliches and creates really interesting characters and relationships and interactions between those characters. It also creates some genuinely really funny moments which are perfectly placed juxtapositions to the freakiness and unease that dominates so much of this movie. That is actually one of the things I like most about this movie; it's horror, but not in the conventional sense. This film doesn't rely on jump scares whatsoever and more focuses on being smart and crafting a really unique and interesting story. This movie has some really freaky and uncomfortable moments and interactions that give viewers so much unease and anxiety regarding what will happen next. Get Out has great intellectual and social horror within it and the acting gives that so much depth and makes it even freakier. The characters in the movie do some really smart stuff which is a testament to the writing and directing and helps some scenes to be really engaging and clever. The film flows very smoothly and there are no disruptive or awkward moments that hurt the quality of the scenes. It makes a lot of sense and doesn't rely on paranormal, supernatural or fantasy stuff to be unsettling or further along the plot, making this movie very different from other horror movies such as the Insidious and Conjuring franchises. Get Out is also an academic movie. If you're studying film in college, grad school or just as a career, you'll recognize concepts regarding spectatorship in some scenes of the movie. Thus, Get Out is capable of reaching audiences in a way a lot of other horror movies aren't and don't, making it truly unique as a work of art. It's not often that I can say that a horror flick is academic and contains college level concepts in it, and I'm thankful that I can do it with this one. The movie doesn't leave out the \"ah-ha\" moments of clarification, and makes them creative on their own by having certain things become clear and culminate. The end is nice and has a really funny moment in it that helps to perfectly wrap up the movie. Overall, Get Out is a fantastic movie and is a must-see for horror fans due to how unique and thought-provoking it is.",

            "content": "Jordan Peele's 2017 debut film as director, Get Out, is a modern horror masterpiece that plays on the reversal of racist horror tropes while also displaying contemporary covert racism to create a new type of horror film, one that bypasses gore and jump scares and embraces diversity, ultimately appealing to a modern audience that is far more open to conversations about race. \nThe horror genre, which is rooted in literature and has since gained massive popularity through film and television, has a long history of deeply embedded racism. Black characters were often used in horror only as sacrificial lambs, sidekicks, and even supernatural beings alongside their white counterparts. Dick Halloran in The Shining, for instance, \"shines\" like Danny Torrance and yet is the only character to be killed in the film. It was extremely rare for Black characters in horror to make it to the end of the film and even rarer for them to be lead characters. Get Out completely reverses this trope by centering Black characters, allowing them to survive, and making them the heroes of the film. This fairly unprecedented creative choice in Get Out only heightens the film's cultural significance.\nThe true horrors of Get Out are the very realistic instances of covert and overt racism threaded into the film. Upon visiting his white girlfriend's family for the weekend, Chris Washington is repeatedly fetishized, stereotyped, and treated as an \"other.\" It becomes increasingly clear throughout the film that Chris is an outsider. With this realization, Chris and the audience alike become increasingly uncomfortable. In horror, and American history as a whole, there are racist cultural conventions portraying Black people as villains and white people as victims. By reversing this trope, Peele offers audiences a new horror film experience -- one that speaks on modern racism in popular culture and appeals to the increased diversity that horror audiences crave. \nBetween its uniqueness, its nods to horror legend The Shining, its incredible acting and visuals, and its very relevant commentary on race in America, Jordan Peele's Get Out is a must-see. The film does not shy away from addressing the realities of being Black in America, from covert microaggressions to an uneasy relationship with the police. Get Out is frightening not because of a monster under the bed, but rather the monster in bed with Chris. The horrors of racism are a reality and that is what makes the film so captivatingly horrific. A new cultural staple, you cannot call yourself a horror buff or pop culture aficionado without watching.",

As someone who is LGBT+, however, I have experienced discrimination. The discrimination I have faced and the feelings that go along with that are, I have found, quite relatable to some of the things brought up in this film.\n\nEven in just the title \"Get Out\" - the desire to escape is something I've often felt in situations where I am being discriminated against; I feel I want to escape from everyone around me, from everyone who is judging me and sizing me up, and this marvelous film captures that feeling very well.\n\nWhether or not you are someone who likes to find meaning in movies doesn't matter in terms of how enjoyable this movie is.

This film centers around the character Chris who travels to spend the weekend with his girlfriend and her parents. Unlike other film makers within this genre, this film leads to a truly shocking end, leading audience members to make their own horrifying conclusions. Unlike some of Peele's other work, such as Toy Story 4 and Storks, Get Out brings some important social commentary to light in an extremely disturbing way. Nevertheless, this film also keeps this distressing topic wrapped under a thin layer of humor that allows the audience to relax before realizing the extent of what is happening. All Would you describe that propaganda as mostly divisive or mostly exploitative? Is it a mix? Is it primarily something else? Describe an example. What is your critical reaction to propaganda? All in all, I would give this film 5 stars! Not only does it address some important issues, but it leads the audience astray, making them believe that the film is going to be wrapped up in a particular manor. It addresses the complete misunderstanding and underlying racism within today's culture while also attacking the selfishness and ignorance of those who are not affected by this. One of the most alluring things about this film is the cinematography. The use of the lighter and brighter colorization of the family members as well as the fashion that is used to depict the characters is incredible. Not to mention the contrast of white against the blood as well as the astounding acting done by each character. Furthermore, the storyline is extremely well done and quite misleading. Much like films of a similar genre it leaves the audience gasping and shaking at the end. All in all, Get Out is an incredible film that addresses and deconstructs racism in a horrifying and haunting way. Both memorable and entertaining, I would highly recommend.",

The acting is so well done that I actually felt trapped at a party, and I didn't even get the benefit of refreshments!  Ugh.  Watching people talk is not what I want in a movie.  Usually, when there is that many uninteresting people in a movie, I at least get an appearance by Godzilla or some other fantastic thing.  A minor spoiler: Godzilla does not make any appearances in this movie.  There aren't any Marvel Studios level special effects or spectacularness.  So, this really wasn't my kind of movie.  \n      For the story that was told, the actors and actresses did a really fine job.  The movie has a plot, and it takes a while to unfold.

            "content": "Get Out is quite frankly one of the most unique films made in years. The reasons it's critic scores are so high is for that reason. Jordan Peele was revolutionary with his story telling and it was a breath of fresh air to the horror genre. Well it's not exactly a horror film as it could fit under a ton of different genres. The story really brings up a lot of questions about race and the thought that white people stereotype black people in certain ways. It touches on a number of those points throughout and non is more apparent than when Chris is pulled over in his car. He's not even driving and the police officer assumes he's to blame. The amount of incidents in America and around the world which are similar to this are in the media often. Peele really highlights for us the plight that some black people are going through still to this day.\n\nIt's a star making turn for Peele as a director. His follow up film Us was also a incredible movie and he has the Candyman remake coming out later in the year (hopefully) which also looks very good. The uniqueness of his script really made a change in Hollywood. We are usually bogged down with sequels and remakes but he gave us a fresh story and type of film that audiences and critics both loved. \n\nThe cast are excellent. Like I said Kaluuya is reaping the rewards of this film with big roles since and he will continue to get more and more. The star of this film though is Rob. Chris's best mate absolutely makes every scene he's in. His concern for his best friend and distrust of white people is actual comedic gold. For a film with some serious messages and a dark tone at points, his brand of comedy is most welcome. \n\nGet Out is a film most of us need to see. It sends a powerful message and is a exciting new premise. Hopefully Hollywood is going to continue to get more creative and give us exciting new stories like this! If it does we're in for a treat!\n\nCheck out my site LifeLowdown.com for more Film & TV news!",

Here, that isn't the case, especially given that scenes associated with both are clearly designed to serve a unified commentary on race relations. Creepy without resorting to jumpscares or similar cop-outs (opting for the spine-tingle rather than the scream in most instances), and the diverse range of interactions demonstrating the discomfort associated with actually discussing race openly are sincere and well-done. Furthermore, it's not just narrative; the cinematography associated with \"the Sunken Place\" was wholly unexpected and engrossing. One of the most genuine and sincere aspects of this film: only psychopaths use Bing. (4.5/5)",

Daniel Kaluuya, is amazing as the savvy, yet vulnerable, Chris, tricked by psycho-black magic. Allison Williams, his adorable, but menacing, girlfriend and Katherine Keener, her earthy, yet, evil mother are incredible and incredibly horrific. Yet I have mixed feelings after watching this movie a second time. The basic premise is powerful, that white folks saw, and often still see, black folks in limited capacities, i.e. athletes, sex toys, objects to control. Still, the film takes some huge risks that don't always pay off. Though Peele himself is a comic genius in Key & Peele episodes, the comedy here feels like adding Red Skelton to \"Psycho.\" More troubling, \"Get Out\" seeks to lambaste white folks for stereotyping and abusing black folks (all too true) while stereotyping all white folks in the movie as the modern equivalent of evil slave owners. Conversely, most of the black characters are portrayed as mere victims of white oppression. Of course, the film isn't meant to be realistic, anymore than \"Stepford Wives\" (1975). They both operate as effective parables, while taking us on a screaming fun ride.",

            "content": "The movie Get Out is already a highly-acclaimed movie because of its writing and its ability to make light \u2013 for better or for worse \u2013 of racism in the United States. Although the screenwriting and the themes are great, there are many more complexities that go into the making of this movie that sets it apart from other dark comedy and horror movies. These specifications include the profundity of the message, the play on colors, and the intertextuality with other horror films.\n\tThe movie has very clear stance in terms of ideology and ethics \u2013 anti-racism. By putting a spotlight on the micro narratives that are encompassed within racist America, albeit an exaggerated one, the movie is shedding light on the struggles of African-Americans. One of the ways Jordan Peele challenges the status quo is by showing a Black person in both ends of the spectrum \u2013 inexplicable hate and inexplicable fetishization. The fetishization and exoticization in the movie shows a new take on traditional racism in movies because it's a different type of racism that still produces the result of otherizing and antagonizing Black people. The ending, in my opinion, helps solidify the message because as we see a cop car approaching, Chris is ironically seen to give up with the knowledge that, for a Black man, he will be blamed for any and all crime. The fact that the policeman is not only a Black man but Chris's friend is a direct challenge to the Status Quo of white America.\n\tWhat is a movie about race if not another commentary on socialized colors? This is what Get Out establishes subconsciously to the viewers of the movie. Throughout, everything that has to do with Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) is blue \u2013 his shirt, his memories, his cop friend's uniform are all shades of blue. In contrast, his girlfriend's Rose (Allison Williams), in direct contrast, has red and orange hues \u2013 her shirt, her car, and her house all have similar hues. This was very intentional to not only show the contrast between the characters but to signify the roles of the character. For one, not only is red associated with mystery and secret societies, but red and orange hues are known as warm colors; this overwhelming use of warmth takes away its authenticity and with Rose's mother being a hypnotherapist, she was probably well aware of the atmosphere to create.\t\nJordan Peele has gone to reveal all the different references that Get Out has with other horror movies most significant of them is The Shining directed by Stanley Kubrick. This intertextuality with other horror films provides the movie with a self-reflexive and meta-reflexive aspect. The movie establishes the self-reflexive nature early on in the movie when Chris's friend communicates his suspicions about a Black man going to visit his white girlfriend's house. This clearly ascertains the movie as one about race. The meta-reflexivity on horror movies is rather subtle such as when Chris is given a house tour as a reference to The Overlook Hotel in The Shining. This demonstrates how the movie is aware of its status as a horror movie and is also aware of how horror movies are meant to act with its shot patterns and cinematography.",

This is a social commentary on racism and I think everyone would know that when they go in. I think I love this so much because of the suspense created they do such an amazing job at tension. There is one scene where there is just amazing acting where the Mom is sitting in a chair and Daniel is sitting in her office and it is just amazing. This movie is surprisingly funny, the twist in this movie works very well and they reveal it slowly and it very surprising. This movie is kinda a Sci-Fi movie you will understand why after you watched it.\n\nThe score is one of my favorites and the opening has an amazing score to set the tone of the movie. The sound design is amazing if I reveal what is so good about it I will spoil it so yeah wish I could tell you. Like I said before the acting is amazing and award-winning and they should get cast in more things. The script and dialogue are amazing and it feels so grounded and real, and Jordan Peele has come a long way from Comedy Central and I hope he makes so many more movies. The cinematography I love and the camera movements are hypnotizing and the camera pans looks amazing and the closeups are amazing and they show so much emotion in this movie it is like Interstellar with the closeup on Matthew McConaughey.

            "content": "Jordan Peele's \"Get Out\" is a funny, scary and timely horror film about race relations in America. With his directorial debut, writer/director Jordan Peele has crafted a disturbing satire on racism. It's not easy to infuse social commentary into a horror movie, but Peele pulls it off seamlessly. Using a sharp screenplay and excellent ensemble cast, Peele crafts a magnificent first feature that showcases his talents as a filmmaker. Peele's screenplay is superb and arguably the main highlight of the movie. Filled with colorful characters, witty dialogue and hilarious situations, the script elevates the film to another level. In terms of acting, the entire cast is at the top of its game. Daniel Kaluuya delivers a dazzling performance as an African-American man caught in a horrific situation. With riveting expressions, he captures the terror of being a victim of racism. Although \"Get Out\" is hauntingly effective, ultimately it is not a flawless horror film. It starts off with an intriguing premise, but loses steam towards the end. Peele goes a little overboard with the ending. Peele's decision to end the movie with a bload-soaked finale is bold and innovative, but it doesn't entirely work. Nevertheless, fans of horror films will definitely enjoy \"Get Out\" and so will movie-goers seeking a timely message. At a time when racism is rarely depicted in horror films, it's reassuring to be reminded that movies like \"Get Out\" are still getting made.",

I only begrudgingly appreciate movies by Blumhouse as I'm not generally convinced that extremely low budgets do anything to make better movies, just better profit margins, but in several of their movies they've surprised me, this included. The music was also very well done, an interesting thing since it was the composer's very first movie credit.",

            "content": "Film Review: Get Out\nIntroduction\nThe Get Out movie is good because feels fresh and rare in a way that studio horror movies almost never do. The movie however, doesn't feels no such obligations manners. A movie of horror about a black guy (Daniel Kaluuya) trying to survive his first weekend with his white girlfriend's (Allison Williams) family, it's locked in the present, he feels uncomfortable because he is the only black guy in the house and the family of her girlfriend act weird in front of him.\nSummary of the movie\nChris (Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams), they are preparing to go home to meet her parents doing the luggage. Rose hasn't told them he's black, and Chris get a little angry because is going to me akward which she blows off as no big deal, but he's wary. His TSA Agent buddy (LilRel Howery) warns him against going too and tell him is to soon because they are only 4 months together, but Chris is falling in love with Rose.\nOn the way to the house of rose's parents on the road they are talking and they are running through a deer and it damages a little the car of Rose, Chris goes down to see the damage and what went through and sees that the focus of the car of the front part broke and the rearview mirror broke and he hears noises from the animal that went through and goes to see him and was dead and if it was a deer they call the police by Rose and the policeman tells him that he should have called Animal control and the policeman asks Rose for her identification and gives it to and, then turns to see Chris who is sitting in the car and asks for identification to the same and was not driving and Rose tells the police that because if the He was not driving and the policeman tells him that this is the protocol and tells him that no and Chris is giving him the identification and Rose says no and the policeman decides not to give it to him and leaves and Rose tells him that he should not be like that and they get into the car and Chris thanks rose for defending him.\nChris and Rose arrive at her parents' house, something is unsettling. Sure, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener) seem friendly enough, but almost too much so, like they're looking to impress Chris. More unnerving is the demeanor of a groundskeeper named Walter (Marcus Henderson) and a housekeeper named Georgina (Betty Gabriel), There's just something wrong. But, as we so often do in social or racial situations, Chris keeps trying to excuse their behavior maybe Walter is jealous and maybe Georgina has an issue with Chris being with a white woman. The lurking presence of Rose's odd brother (Caleb Landry Jones), doesn't help. \nChris go out to have a smoke one night, and, well, things start to get even stranger in ways I won't spoilin fact, the preview gives away way too much. Avoid it if you can.\nOpinion of the movie \nGet out is a great phycological thriller and i think the movie is creative and creepy but well written. A film that makes us think and a little freaked out at the same time. They talk a lot of racism because they kill black guys, the movie is a little weird and in some ways you don't understand the movie in the beginning o in the middle of the movie the interpretation is good you understand the racism in the movie but I don't understand a \"good\" reason and the movie doesn't say why the family want to kill Chris, we all no they don't like black people but what the black people do to they, to compare that in the movie American history x act by Edward Northon is also a movie of racism and the character of Edward his name is Derek Vinyard he don't like black people because one of them kills his father and you no that is the reason that he hate clack people but in get out don't and that is one that is the only reason I hate about the movie \nConclusion \nThe movie Get Out is good you going to like the movie is creepy and cool this movie the actors play there roll well but is a little gore the final so if you don't like that just read my review, the end is \"Chris survive\".\nCreepy/Siniestro\nWeird/\tRaro\nGore/Sangriento \nLove/Amor \n\nDirect by Jordan Peele",

The creepy and unsettling moments build great tension and suspense. You are constantly asking questions you want answers to, which keeps you constantly engaged in the scene. The movies core deals with race relations between white people and African Americans. It shows how some African American people still deal with residual racism, and how uncomfortable it can be to meet your girlfriends parents. It also heavily plays on white peoples cultural appropriation of African American's in modern society. The third act twist is satisfying and well written. With all the terrible horror movies that have come out in the last decade, Get Out was a much needed breath of fresh air.",

            "content": "The horror genre has often been used to comment on social issues what with The Beguiled (1971) serving as a statement on the result of the oppression of women but this film has been acclaimed as the socially conscious film of our times. I personally didn't see the film as being quite as clever or entertaining as many have claimed it is but it still had some merits and was better than the average horror film. No, this was not one of the best films of 2017 by any means, Love After Love (2017), The Florida Project (2017) and The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017) were better, and I wanted so desperately to like it more than I did.\n\nYoung African-American photographer Chris, Daniel Kaluuya, is concerned about meeting the parents of his wealthy, white girlfriend Rose Armitage, Allison Williams, because he believes they might be racist. When he meets them he is unsettled by their subtle racism as they make offensive comments but are never actively hostile. He is hypnotized by matriarch, Missy, Catherine Keener, while having his fears about the docile African-American servants at the house assuaged by Armitage's overbearing father Dean, Bradley Whitford. Chris tries to keep in contact with his friends as he witnesses increasingly suspicious actions and realizes that the Armitages may be using him for their own purposes. Armitage tries to subdue him but after a dramatic dinner party he becomes obsessed with getting away from the family and revelations about his girlfriend's romantic history cause him to believe that he is one of her many targets in a giant plot.\n\nThe most effective sequences in the film come when Whitford and Keener deliver chillingly unaware monologues about how they \"Voted for Obama\" or admire the athletes who delivered a Black Power salute at the 1968 Olympics. There is a strange envy in their voices as it is almost as though they have the desire to be persecuted and through the eyes of our protagonist, who has faced persecution in his life, this is something to fear. When an intensely creepy Caleb Landry Jones, as Armitage's wild brother Jeremy, leers at Chris and questions him aggressively as to why he has not pursued a career in athletics the tension ramps up and understand the small but deadly slights that African-Americans have to face almost every day. Peele's screenplay tackles this issue efficiently and effectively as he does not belabor the point and Whitford and Keener's disarming deliver is so smooth that it knocks you off balance.\n\nKeener is the one who really steals the whole picture as the tight smiles and passive aggressive comments she dishes off in almost every scene are delightfully insincere. While Keener has the power to be charismatic her best performances have required her to play uptight, angry women who express their internal range through chipping away at others. Whitford is decent as he spends his time trying to prove just how liberal and socially progressive he is but Keener is truly villainous with her masterful hypnotism of her prey and utter lack of remorse coming off as terrifying. Of all of the performances in this film Keener would have been most deserving of an Academy Award nomination. Instead Kaluuya who is fine but relatively forgettable received the recognition in a lineup that could have included Casey Affleck in A Ghost Story (2017) and Harris Dickinson in Beach Rats (2017).\n\nThe movie got far too self-important when reviews made it seem as though it was making a political statement on the level of No End (1985) or Short Working Day (1981). The film isn't an incredible political satire as while it makes it's points well it does become a dumb horror film in it's third act and while the scares are decent they are not on the level of Suspiria (1977) or The Shining (1980). Horror films are not my favorite as while I can appreciate the fact that films like Carrie (1976) and Psycho (1960) are exceptionally good I do not see this film as being on that level and as a comedy and a political statement it is not quite good enough. I have many friends who love the film and see it as being exciting and informative but I happen to not be in that camp.",

I even saw it twice to be sure. I thought it would be a realistic, intense thriller about how there is still racism today, but I was simply let down with the sci fi twist. If there is one thing I admired, it was the comic relief character. If you have seen this movie, you know who I mean. Sorry that I cannot remember his name. His comedy in this was hilarious, but alongside how serious and sober the rest of the film is, it sticks out like a sore thumb. I would say this movie would deserve a 50% score if I were being generous, and I have no idea why I would be generous.",

All of the technical aspects created An eeriness that gradually keeps you on the edge the whole time. Performances as usual were magnificent (Especially from the Lead actor Daniel Kaluuya). The brutality and the gore in the climax fulfilled the story. It makes your heart racing! Now you must be wondering if I'm praising this film that much ; then why I'm giving this a 7/10? There are some reasons for that! The Rod Williams character annoyed me the most, I don't understand the need of adding unnecessary comic scenes or humours into these kind of movies which are supposed to be serious and scary throughout ! Well I'm not going to spoil the main concept but it felt Poorly explained and illogical in a sense! The story could have easily elaborated all the facts in much more clearer fashion! The Director wanted to put all of our attention to the main character of Chris ; and in order to achieve that he somehow neglected the other major character buildups! Those were needed in my opinion. Overall a Technically sound movie that delivers on the main subject of Racism culture and at the same time makes you uneasy and scared but in no way it's a flawless film.",

What was in particular an extremely smart decision by Peele was his decision to make Rose evil (and subvert the white savior trope), which makes you rethink and view everything before in such a hauntingly different way. That of course can also be attributed to Allison Williams' performance (I will never forget how she so seamlessly transitions into evil mode), while the rest of the ensemble also all do great jobs (especially Daniel Kaluuya who was great but maybe not Oscar-worthy, and Betty Gabriel who really did something crazy with her performance). Unfortunately, though, while I loved the very strong mystery horror side of this film, I was not a fan of the comedy (which provided too much tonal inconsistency) and thought that as a whole, the strong narrative and symbolic imagery was never matched by strong enough racial commentary. This is unlike Peele's second film Us, where the latter seems to be stronger. Overall, however, Peele still does a very much Oscar-worthy job where his vision is thoroughly focused and used to craft a thrilling film.

It has great surprises, acting, writing, perfectly balanced humor, but above all, it delivers a gut-punching message that is very important to today\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s social and political climate. There is even an alternate ending that will leave you with a lasting pang of guilt that will force you to examine the very threads of this world, and more specifically your world. First off, one of the awesome things about this film is, in fact, the camera work. Jordan Peele did a great job of shooting each scene, in a way that made the horror scenes seem scarier, like how the camera was closer and shakier. Another great thing was acting. For instance, Allison Williams, who played the innocent girlfriend, and transitioned with ease to then play a horror villain who seduces black people to eventually transfuse them with other people's consciousness. Also, Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford, who play \"woke\" parents who struggle to accept the interracial relationship, and then transition to playing a demented psychiatrist and neurosurgeon respectively. And then there is Caleb Landry Jones, who has a stellar performance of the drunk, dark, and brooding brother in the background. \nAnother thing that makes this movie so superb is it's writing. First about this, is the basic plot. The way that the movie starts off so innocently, but weaves itself into being just terrifying. With the subtle, but very creepy Andre, to Missy and her wacky and just plain scary therapy sessions. Then at the end, the surgery which detaches scalps and shows brains, to people getting stabbed with a taxidermied moose, kicked in the head, choked, stabbed with a fork, and shot with a gun. Then there is also the other aspect of the film, which is what makes it so great. Jordan Peele wrote the film with his parts of his Key and Peele experience, and it was also very funny. Most of the jokes, however, required bad language, but it paid off. There weren't too many jokes, but the amount of them was great and hit a perfect balance with the rest of the seriousness of the movie. Then there is the message. The villain of the movie might appear to be the Armitage's, but the real horror is systemic racism. The alternate ending also conveys this message. It shows how the system, the racially biased system, always favors the majority. It also shows how one can beat there own demons and feel at peace with themselves, even in the midst of all life's craziness. However, there are the downsides, like how the characters don't have clear arcs and the film is quite jump-scarey, but the movie is really just plain great.",

A question to ask friends: at what point does the movie shift decisively from satire to horror? That there\u2019s no clear, obvious answer is a tribute to Peele\u2019s ingenuity and skill in blending the two. The film is beautifully directed, with a nuanced color palette and expressively fluid camerawork. When the shift into horror does arrive, the movie\u2019s art-film look makes it all the more seductive and powerful. And the nightmarish visions that occupy the tale\u2019s final act couldn\u2019t be more purposeful. If the satiric sections suggest a superficial gloss on current racial relations, the darker elements take us much deeper, all the way back to the brutalities of slavery that still undergird American experience. There could hardly be a better to movie to begin the year when America\u2019s first black president was replaced by one who appeals to white supremacists, further proof that history is anything but a continuous forward march.

For example, when Rose and Chris are travelling to the Armitage estate and the deer flies past their car, why does Rose call the cops if she's into the plan of kidnapping Chris? Doesn't that just leave a trail for Rod to find Chris when he's out to search Chris. \n\nSpeaking of Rod, Chris tells Rod to take care of his dog, and Rose has NO ISSUES WITH IT? Is this even a kidnapping at this point? Why not just force Chris to take the dog along? Why let him tell Rod to take care of the dog and telling him he was headed to Rose's parents? This in particular is the only reason Rod is able to figure out a lot of the \"mystery\" around the Armitages, which shows some of the weaknesses of the story.\n\nThese are only some of the plot holes in the movie, and there is a LONG LIST of them. The story is not very tight.\n\nActing-wise, there were some really good moments that I personally found enjoyable as they added to the storyline. For example, when the couple is travelling to the estate, Rose snatches away Chris' cigarette and throws it out. This is good. It is later carried onto when the Armitages point out Chris' natural tick when he's craving a smoke. It's natural progression and it works. Another example would be when the dad rants about deers. This could be translated as him being on his nerves while talking to Chris, and it comes off well. \n\nMessage-wise:\n1) Racism is still very prevalent in the US\n2) Liberal elites (white people especially) have some weird fetish for black people.\n\nI think the message is pretty strong, and is worth the mention. Peele did capture SOME of it, like when the whole party is treating Chris like a big star, and unnaturally attracted to him (the lady asking about the sex [Mask it in subtlety and anything is fair game]), and where the white fellas are all awkward around Chris. The message does get sent, but not to a great extent. And I'm fairly certain it's due to the mediocre story-writing. Message is important, but not as much as the story telling.",

Get Out, is littered with symbolism having to do with slavery and the old south as well as capturing Peele\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s more overt theme of racial horror. In an interview, Peele described this movie as one that reflects real fears of his and real issues that he\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s dealt with in the past. The build-up of malevolence in the house, the suspense and odd behavior and twist at the end of the film make Jordan Peele\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s Get Out, one for the ages. Although it deviates as a horror film by implicating many sub genres, Get Out\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s true horror lies with the real-life implications it hiddenly conveys through the use of eyes, animals and even cameras. Throughout the film, director Jordan Peele uses the sense of sight to amplify imbalances of power and control often drawn along racial lines. \nIt\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s notable to say that the symbolism of eyes and cameras is a crucial part of the film since even before we see Chris (the main character) we are introduced to him through his art. The audience is shown black-and-white prints of his work on the walls of his Brooklyn apartment in a sequence set to Childish Gambino\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2Red Bone\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2?. It is established at the beginning that Chris through his profession is a trained observer. Constantly around his neck, his camera functions as a protective shield of sorts between the odd behavior he encounters, especially from the family\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s large group of white friends and neighbors and two black servants, Georgina and Walter. Chris\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM) camera is also a means to observe and escape. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s through his lens that Chris spots another black person at the Armitages\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM) gatherings. It is obvious to see that the man that Chris spots when he goes up to him and introduces himself to is not himself. Logan as he introduces himself to Chris has a glossy look and a far-off stare, which Chris makes note of . When Chris takes a picture of Logan to send to a friend the flash goes off and a bizarre transformation takes place. Logan\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s face turns that of happy to that of fear. With blood coming from his nose he launches himself at Chris screaming, \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2Get Out!\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2?, which seems like an act of aggression but Chris senses it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s something else. This scene evokes multiple motifs of the importance of cameras and phones for many African-Americans experiencing police brutality, especially in light of an earlier scene where Chris is asked to show I.D when he wasn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t the one driving. It is no coincidence that photographic evidence later provides Chris with his biggest clues as he tries to uncover the secrets of the Armitages\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM). Somewhat plainly, Get Out, suggests that cameras have the power to reveal. \nAs stated before, Get Out, is loaded with symbolism of slavery and the old south, with the plantation like estate of the Armitages\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM) and some older looking costumes of Georgina. These visuals echo that or past is forever interwoven into our present. The first time of something wrong occurs when the deer crashes into the car. The moaning deer is linked to Chris and is an omen of what is to come for him. As Nick(classmate) pointed out, in one frame the front of the car is seen post deer accident and the only bloody side is the passenger side, the side Chris is sitting in. Chris is viewed as the innocent sacrifice just like the deer and in the final act, when Chris is strapped to the chair he looks up and sees the deer head on the wall, symbolism for what the family wants to do to him, make him a dead trophy. \nChris\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM) escape is by no means a happy ever after type story, when Rodd comes to save Chris, he serves as the comic Deus Ex Machina. Here, the comedy, hope and relief save the story from the defeats that conclude Stepford Wives and Rosemary\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s Baby yet there is still a lurking threat skulking beyond the grounds of the Armitage home at the end of Get Out. What resonates with many and underscores the happy ending notions that underneath our progress, there is, under the surface, that lingering prejudice and antagonism. After the film concludes, it makes us ponder the thought that we might learn to be a little less na\u00c3\u00afve, a little more cautiously paranoid and open our eyes to how potently our history still informs our present. As the saying goes, history tends to repeat itself time and time again.",

            "content": "How will you weave a story full of morals and social issues into a movie? A debuting director, Jordan Peele, had to ask himself that question. He\u00e2(TM)s the extraordinaire who directed the captivating film, Get Out. The horror film may be one of 2017\u00e2(TM)s best movies, if not the best. It touches on issues revolving the past and the society that we all know today. Peele gives his audience the opportunity to dive into a world full of wonders and mysteries, leaving them off of the edge of their seats. \nAs a black man, Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya), is faced with prejudice throughout the movie as he dates his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams). As the plot thickens, he decides to visit his girlfriend\u00e2(TM)s family for some time. Chris uncovers secretive things as he learns more about her family -- things that he wished he didn\u00e2(TM)t know. When Chris arrived at the house with Rose, they are introduced by her mother, Missy Armitage (Catherine Keener), and father, Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford). After spending some time there, he realizes that something was strange. He finds out that Rose\u00e2(TM)s mother brainwashes people and her father perform extreme neurological procedures. Chris has to survive through these insane moments and \u00e2get out\u00e2? of the house to be freed from Rose\u00e2(TM)s family and their craziness. \nA plot like this is one of the many reasons why Get Out got so many good critics, including mine. This movie is no other. It isn\u00e2(TM)t just some boring, shabby movie that is clich\u00c3 (C) -- it\u00e2(TM)s a masterpiece. It has many hidden hints and \u00e2easter eggs\u00e2? that contributes to the overall message. For example, when the couple were on the way to Rose\u00e2(TM)s house, they accidently hit a deer on the road. They watched the deer gradually die as they resettle. (***SPOILER ALERT) When Chris got brainwashed by Missy Armitage, he was sent to a room that had him strapped to a chair. At that moment, he finds a head of a deer on the wall directly in front of him. This represents how after he watched the deer die, the deer came back to watch him die. Furthermore, the horror behind it screams excitement to my ears. I love how they sneak little creepy moments throughout the movie while not just implementing them to make it just scary. The director takes the subject of race and transform it into an entertaining work of art that attracts many watchers across the globe. This movie is mostly for young adults and mature teenagers, but if you\u00e2(TM)re up for the challenge, then go for it! 5/5 Stars",

I won't go into spoilers, but this movie raises a lot of interesting questions. Can something be racist and not racist at the same time? \n\nWhat the villain(s) do of course is horrible, but their reasoning, though still morally wrong, can be interpreted as both racist and not racist at the same time! You can argue that them going after black people specifically is racist, but another person can argue that it's in a weird way, admiring black people... just in the most evil way possible.\n\nGet Out messes with my head, and it is very very clever with how everything is set up and resolved.\n\n10/10",

This is probably the closest anyone has come to replicating the feel of the original Ghostbusters movie. The offbeat premise could work for a horror or a comedy. While it provides laughs, it takes the situation seriously (unlike the new Ghostbusters, which had no laughs and treated the ghosts like a joke). It builds suspense, and uses comedy to dispel the tension. I wish more movies would aim to be this original.",

What's so clever, though, is that it doesn't go about it in any way that you might expect, keeping things mysterious with an increasingly bizarre atmosphere, until the fantastic and surprising crescendo of a final act. The characters are brilliantly played by a talented cast (Kaluuya is superb) and the dialogue hones in on how alienating people can be (whether they mean to or not) when talking to someone of colour. Of course, Peele being Peele, you might expect at least some humour there; fear not, there is a bit of that, too. Overall, it's just a really smart and entertaining film that, at the same time, manages to \"air the dirty laundry\", so to speak, and forces people to think about stereotypes, prejudice, racism and how we interact with one another in general. Bringing that together in such an enjoyable way is no easy feat.",

The acting is very good and is like the actors were in the movie and thinking the same of the characters, it seems very real.\nIn this movie you never will have bored because all the details like the soundtrack and the emotional effects that this transmit to you are very weird but good also the actor are the most of the time on front of the camera so you need to be very attend to understand the story. Also one of the best scenes is when Chris tried to say hello to a \"friend\" but this boy saw the protagonist with a rare way. This film can make you learn that everything is not like it seems.\nFinally in my opinion this movie is very good in a number scale of 1-10 my rate is 8 because this movie is very interesting and have a lot of things that are perfectly located, also this teach something that will be very important in your life.",

Sin embargo, todo cambia para Chris cuando descubre que los afroamericanos que trabajan en la casa, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n en la casa de los vecinos, se comportan de una forma bastante extra\u00f1a.\nLa pel\u00edcula est\u00e1 categorizada bajo el g\u00e9nero de terror pero en realidad en su interior contiene una variedad de diferentes g\u00e9neros, en donde justamente el terror no considerar\u00eda el principal sino el suspenso (y aunque tenga algo toques humor\u00edsticos no es una comedia como la catalogaron en los Golden Globes). Como mencionamos, una de las nominaciones que obtuvo para los premios Oscars es por su guion original, y sin dudas el guion que presenta la pel\u00edcula es original con un giro bastante inesperado y sorprendente pero que en lo personal por momentos not\u00e9 bastante exagerado a los l\u00edmites de la ciencia ficci\u00f3n. A pesar de esto, no deja de ser una historia entretenida, atrapante y con carga social, con lo cual su nominaci\u00f3n a mejor pel\u00edcula ya es un gran premio en si para un film de bajo presupuesto como es el caso de \u00a1Huye!\nEn cuanto a la nominaci\u00f3n a Daniel Kaluuya como mejor actor es, efectivamente, la m\u00e1s merecida de las cuatro, ya que mediante su actuaci\u00f3n logra llevar climax de la pel\u00edcula.

The racial aspects were a bit forced but that isn\u2019t a big talking point for me. The ending was kind of foolish and seemed like something written originally for a trashy horror-comedy type film. It had a much darker alternate ending that would\u2019ve completely changed the tone of the movie and made it much better, but was ditched for the \u201cHollywood Ending\u201d TLDR: Jordan Peele does well for his first outing and gets some good performances out of his top billed actors.

Jordan Peele has decided to examine the fallacy of a \"post racist\" America in the wake of our first Black President, twisting the concept of eugenics and allowing our Black protagonist to do what few Black people do in this genre: survive the first half hour! \n\nSharp writing, carefully thought out scenes and superb acting all come together to create a horror movie that has its share of blood but also a peek into the banality of evil.  The characters resonate well and are believable as well as likeable, at least as we first meet them all. The brevity of he film was my only disappointment, and to avoid spoilers, all I can truly add is you will spend the last half hour gripping your seat; remember to breathe! Peele has also carefully hidden some allegories you might not catch with all the action, so it would be prudent to keep your eye \"peeled\" for them (pun intended!). \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this movie!",

Jordan Peele employs a Kubrickian attention to detail that also makes Get Out an excellent rewatch. There are a few great twists so if you haven't seen it, try to go in knowing as little as possible. I talk about performances a lot because it's just what I gravitate to the most, and I'm thrilled for Daniel Kaluuya that he was nominated for his role, but the whole cast is note-perfect.

This represents the instant suspicion that white people in positions of power seem to have against blacks and other minorities.

Yet, it never feels didactic and it somehow manages to be fun, creepy, and in the same ballpark as films like The Stepford Wives (1975).  You see, Chris, an up-and-coming photographer (played by Daniel Kaluuya) is going to meet his girlfriend's parents for the first time at their posh country estate.  He's Black, she's White - the parents don't know and he's (justly) apprehensive.  Writer-Director Jordan Peele captures the awkward moments as the White people bring up everything/everyone they know in Black culture and treat Chris as _the_ representative of his ethnic group (played nearly as satire).  But then it gets weird and weirder.  Peele knows how to manage the tension and Kaluuya is expert at reacting naturally to the bizarre events that unfold (which start with his girlfriend's mom, played by Catherine Keener, hypnotizing him, purportedly to get him to stop smoking).  Unlike many horror films, the script manages to depict its hero as someone with a brain, who seeks to Get Out when things go from bad to worse. And for all its strangeness, the weird elements get nicely tied together at the end, when the big reveal happens.  (So, you might want to go back and watch it again to see the clues that you might have missed the first time).  In the end, the film turns out to be a fun ride that still manages to raise an alarm, shining a light on a particularly vexed and vexing aspect of American culture that shows no signs of getting better - true horror indeed.",

            "content": "Get Out was an important movie because it made me think, but it was a good movie because it grabbed so I watched the whole thing. When a film is entertaining and helps you understand the world better, then it is a great movie. Get Out used a fictional account to tackle subtle racism in our society, showed the difficulties still present in interracial relationships, and demonstrated the horror of slavery that still affects young African American men today. Get Out was a great movie because it did what the newspapers didn't do, it provided a way for all of us to witness what it must be like to be young, male, and African American trying to fit into an upper middle class white world in a way that everyone could understand.\nGet Out was an important movie because it showed how hard it was to be an African American man struggling to be accepted in a white world. For example, when the black protagonist, Chris, was at the dinner table with his white girlfriend's brother, the brother questioned Chris as if he were a hoodlum. The white guy had no idea what to say to a black guy so he resorted to stereotypes. As a Caucasian woman, I had no idea of what it would be like to be a young black man, so I might not have known what to say to a black dinner guest either. Chris's responses to the brother's stereotypical questions showed that real African American men aren't all hoodlum and how silly the stereotypes are.\nIt should be obvious that all black men are not into fighting, but the news in 2016 sensationalized violence done to black men in a way that it didn't really sink in. Even events such as the Trayvon Martin shooting or the Black Lives Matter movement were portrayed as something happening to someone else far away. The news didn't really focus on Trayvon Martin as a real kid, instead the media used the example to focused on the racism in general. Get Out humanized racial stereotypes in a way that I could see them and feel why they were wrong.\nGet Out went beyond racial the brother's racial bias to show that it occurs even when the person doesn't believe their racist. The girlfriend's father confides in Chris that he would have voted for Obama for a third time if he could. The father was trying to be nice to Chris, but it sounded so stupid. The scene drove home the point that a person's skin color does not dictate the person's politics. This reminded me of times when I have made assumptions about people that turned out to be stupid or wrong. It showed me that young black men, even when people are trying to be nice to them, are subjected to stereotypes and racial prejudice.\nThe news can't really deal effectively with more subtle racism that occurs when the person doesn't believe they are racist. The media jumps to the most startling case so people will view it or \"like\" it. This type of journalism doesn't show people how engrained stereotypes are in everyday life. In the movie, you could see that the father should have asked Chris about school or ask about subjects until they found something in common. I have never seen a newspaper or even an advice column deal with this issue. It took a movie to clarify the depth of racial stereotyping in our society.\nGet Out depicted how hard it was for an African American man to date a Caucasian woman because of the deep prejudice in our society. The movie showed how uncomfortable Chris was in meeting his girlfriend's white parents. It also showed that his Caucasian girlfriend, Rose, was so uncomfortable that she didn't tell her parents that her boyfriend was African American. It was so realistic for me, I would have a hard time telling my parents that my boyfriend was African American, and the movie made it clear that that made it harder for the African American boyfriend. I could see how much harder it was for a black man to meet a White father than it would have been for a White man in the same role. These details in the storyline made it an important movie, because it made crystal clear how hard it is to be a black man with a white girlfriend even in the 21st century.\nThe movie Get Out was released on February 24th, 2017, which was a perfect time to reflect how interracial relationships because there were still many stories in the news about problems between blacks and whites. The media missed the opportunity to tackle this important issue because it focused on hate crimes against African Americans.  While hate crimes are bad, openly discussing the difficulties of interracial relationships would go further to understanding what it is like to be an African American man in the 21st century. Get Out went beyond the headlines of what was happening to some African Americans to tackle everyday circumstances like dating. When it comes to interracial dating, some white parents do not support their child dating an African American. The movie made it clear, it is hard for the African American man to date a white woman.\nFinally, Get Out portrayed enslavement of African American men in a way that made me understand the horror of slavery and how easy it would be to enslave people again. It was chilling to see Rose's dad, Dean, hold an auction for who was going to get Chris as a slave. This was gripping because it felt like it could really happen. Even though I was probably not the intended audience, even I could understand how bad it would be to be an enslaved African American man was because of how it was depicted in the movie.\n While Get Out was fiction, it made me realize that there are real life connections that I never thought about. The news reports of unarmed black men being killed by police were frequent in 2016 and 2017. There were even stories of their parents reminding their teenaged black sons to be extra cooperative with the police, so they didn't get shot. The media does a good job highlighting the horror, but did not focus on how some white people stilled held black lives in their hands. Get Out did what the newspapers couldn't, it made me see that the life of an African American man is still held back by aspects of slavery that still persist in our society.\nGet Out was a great movie because it used fiction to highlight how hard it is to be an African American young man in the 21st century. As a Caucasian female, this movie raised my awareness of issues such as racial stereotypes, difficulties with interracial relationships and how horrible slavery really is. These issues aren't part of my normal world, so it took a movie like Get Out to convey the problems and show how they are occurring in our world today. The media didn't, and probably couldn't convey the same topics as well as the movie. The news media focuses on big issues which seem far away. The media doesn't dwell on personal relationships or on subtle stereotypes. The material is not exciting enough to get people to read it. Most importantly, the media does not focus young unarmed black men being killed by white men as a subtle for of slavery. They focus on whether the police officer was scared and the black man's provocation. Like the slave of old, it is up to the young unarmed black man not to provoke the white man to kill him. I am glad I saw Get Out. It was a great movie because it did what the newspapers didn't do, gave me a glimpse into African American man's life and made me see, in a way news accounts never did, how racism and even slavery are still a real part of that life today.",

I was drawn to this film by the 99 percent critic rating, mistaking that rating for a measure of how good the film is.  99 percent tells me only that 99 percent of the critics could not give the film a thumbs down.  99 percent would give the film a 5.1 or higher on a 10 point scale.  What if the vast majority of the critics only found the film to be as good as 5.1 and no better.  On a 100 point scale, that's an average of 51%.  Now as it turns out, the IMDB rating is 7.7, which on a 100 point scale would be 77%.  This is a much more accurate appraisal than 99%.  I was hoodwinked.  I like cult and conspiracy films.

It is goddamn pointless these days. \n\nThe movie itself is slightly below average - meaning the plot is incredibly predictable, it's so unrealistic it's dumb, and sometimes I find it just cringy and/or boring. The acting isn't terrible, it can be a bit goofy at times, but not the worst I've ever seen. \n\nThe real problem I have with this movie is it's intent - that racism against black people is one of the biggest problems facing America today and it needs to be discussed EVEN MORE than it already has for decades. Give me a break. White people are not demons who will lure black people into their homes and torture them. It portrays America as a place where black people are seen as second class citizens who have no rights - although Peele himself is living proof that it's not. I agree with another reviewer here, if this was set in the 70's, I might have given it a pass - even though the plot is still stupid - but this is set in modern times where being racist is about equally horrible to being a pedophile. Liberals are not a minority, white people are not the devil, racism is not a big issue today. Take it from Larry Elder, a black lawyer born in the 50's who grew up in California's South Central, he also said this. \n\nWhy this movie is getting so much praise when it's actually average at best is beyond me. If people are rating this 100% only because a black person wrote and directed then that in itself is racism, because you're holding black people to a lower standard. If this was created by a white person where the plot was reversed nobody would give a damn. Stop looking at who made it and what color their skin is and look at the actual movie. Is it any good?

Normally, I like to keep politics out of movie reviews, but this film was so saturated with racial messages that doing so would be impossible.\n\nPainting white people out to be racist has been done to death these days, and it does far more harm than good. Now even had the roles been reversed, or this simply wasn't a racially driven film, I would not have found it scary.\n\nHad the film taken place in 1970, none of this political jargon would have even been an issue as it would have been a more believable plot element. However it takes place in 2017, where liberals are the vocal majority who think they're the minority and conservatives are often just ignorant non racist human beings. That wouldn't make the film much scarier though, just more bearable. It's a well directed piece of propaganda with some horror elements, and that's about it. It fails to send a message that we don't already know, but most of all it fails at being a horror film. If you're an objective party looking for a good scare, watch Sinister 2 or something.",

My most favorite part of the movie was when Chris finds the photos in the red box which eventually led to my least favorite part of it all- that is the one where Rose acts as if she cannot find the keys (a very unnecessary thing since the mother could, with just a spoon in a cup, make Chris petrified and, also, due to the fact that with the previous scene it was understood that she was already part of it).

This is the most unexpected, a film that I saw almost a year ago and, although I considered it incredible then, I got the opportunity to watch it again. And the act of rewatching, specially in a film like this, is not innocuous as the film's brilliance is microscopically inserted into its texture. Get Out represents a landmark of cinema, a new spin in the horror genre that interweaves the release of tension resulting from centuries of oppression and a full-realized dystopia that serves as a metaphor for the current world. It's a film that elevates the significance of every of its symbols with the finesse and tension of a Hitchcock film. It's truly an inspiring movie whose power to inspire and change minds is amazingly greater than Black Panther. The latter being so overt about its theme it grinds on the pantomimic, and the former being a subtle exercise on ideology, working outwards from a theme and not otherwise. It's a highly enjoyable film because adding to this theme and original concept, there's a fine script and vibrant performances. However, I do think that in trying to make a pantomime of similar movies, it gets too lost and direction forgets to be exciting. Therefore, I can't praise its consistency but I can give the benefit of the doubt to the third viewing. Also, it's one of the most impressive directorial debuts ever seen, a feat of movie-making. It's easily the smartest horror movie of the year and it's even more easily one of the most refreshing films of the decade.",

Its actually extremely predictable and considering there isn't actually any horror in it, I'm confused as to why people are saying its a game changer in the genre. Unless of course the game is changing horror from scary to not at all scary.\nIn my opinion there is a lot of sucking up to the black community going on. Definitely not worthy of the acclaim it has received.\nThere.....It has been said. Lol",

Peele does capture the discomfort apologetic white liberals leave in their wake but fails to make that specificity clear, which, for a film as high profile as it's become, can lead to widespread misunderstandings about contemporary mass-racism--the real horror of this film. In other words, Peele shares a real issue, but addressing it as a wide issue can come across as small-minded. Its intentions can surpass generic race issues and audiences can connect to it in terms of modern LGBT issues, timeless family dynamics, and nationality, but due to its black-vs-white racial heavy-handedness, the film itself almost tries to ignore these possibilities. In fact, the racial implications are so heavy-handed that any horror genre elements feel like cheap extremism for \"entertainment\" points. For example, the final stretch is utter messy nonsense. Many things here do show off a beginner's hand, which makes it hard to take too seriously, though many people are; which, as previously mentioned, is the real horror! In mass American culture, this film is 35 years outdated.",

It was just because black people were fashionable really their words. The actor Daniel Kaluuya  even got annoyed when journalist said Get Out \"ticks a lot of boxes, in some ways\". But maybe it does stereo type black people the way he was and he's friend was in this film. This reminded me of Kevin Hart very funny guy but never would be in best actor category. Let's be serous for a moment Denzel Washington,Daniel Day-Lewis two of the best ever and Garry old man and boy Timoth\u00e9e something from interstellar  which are Hollywood actors up against an unknown actor who in England played a stereo type of a black traffic warden parking pataweyo in uk.wow does this guy only play stereo types.",

            "content": "I think I've mentioned this in another review some time ago, I don't remember where or for what movie, but my father is black.  I don't have contact with my father nor have I had any contact with him for either 15 or 17 years (the timeline is a bit murky for me), but yes, technically speaking, I am half black.  You wouldn't be able to tell this if you were to look at my skin tone, I am one pale asshole, but I am half-black.  I can't begin to tell you how often I've wondered how my lie would have turned out had I been born with a different color and I would have been raised in the United States.  How my I would have looked at the world differently and how the world would have perceived me or, rather, my skin color.  Just something to think about, really.  This is certainly very relevant to the film that I am reviewing this early Monday morning.  This is gonna be one of those movies that's gonna be difficult to review without spoiling, the biggest joy in this film is going in completely blind and not knowing what's about to happen, but I'm certainly gonna try.  Oh, it should also be noted that Jordan Peele won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay last night and goddamn if it isn't well-deserved.  Not only because the concept and the execution thereof is fantastic, but simply because of how thought-provoking and subversive the entire experience is.  It doesn't just work as an effective and disturbing horror movie, it works as an exploration of race relations and the views shared by some of the people that gather at Dean and Missy's house for this yearly 'party'.  But before we get to that, I just wanna say that sometimes there's movies that people rave about and, as much as you try to avoid it, sometimes you get caught up in that, especially if they're people you trust.  Once you come to see these movies, they rarely live up to your own self-created hype.  It's just impossible.  I know Scott Weinberg (a film critic who happens to be a big horror nerd, I also follow him on Twitter) said that Get Out was the best American horror movie he's seen in 15 years.  And it's like, really, dude?  It's that great, huh?  Guess I'll have to see it for myself.  Now that I've seen it and I have witnessed what everybody is talking about for myself, I can say, that in fact, the movie not only lived up to my own expectations, I think it even surpassed them.  This is an absolutely amazing movie, but it's also a movie that works in so many more ways than just a straight-up horror movie, because it just isn't a straight-up horror.  Part of me often imagines the fact that Jordan Peele, writer and director, used his own real life experiences to craft this movie.  His wife is a white woman and I'm certain that, at first, there must have been some awkward interactions between the group.  The point is that this movie could have only come from the mind of someone who has actually gone through this and wanted to share that with the rest of the world, except in this movie it's framed as a disturbing horror movie where the privileged white people bid on black people to use for their own...nefarious purposes.  That's about the only thing I'm gonna say about it, since I really do not want to spoil anything else.  But that's at a later point in the film.  Starting out, with Chris and Rose driving to Rose's parents' house where Chris is gonna meet her parents for the first time, there's an incident where they accidentally hit a deer.  Chris reacts strangely, at first, like he doesn't want to leave the deer behind, but this is a small hint to Chris' past that we get to explore more in-depth later.  Chris arrives to Rose's parents house and finds that they have two black servants.  This is a little strange to Chris, but he doesn't put much thought into it.  Meeting Dean and Missy, things are a little awkward at first, but he just attributes that to them trying to make sure he's comfortable and at ease around them.  You know how some people are, where they go out of their way to be accommodating to a minority, to the point where they're clearly overcompensating for something and that's just as bad, in some respects.  Chris has, probably, gone through this before, but it's nothing too bad.  He starts to get some weird vibes when he finally interacts with the servants, who seem unnecessarily hostile towards him.  Moving on, it is revealed that Dean and Missy's host a party, which I already mentioned, that just happened to coincide with Chris and Rose's visit.  Several more affluent families arrive and Chris starts to interact with them and let's just say it's as awkward as you would imagine.  Because, again, these people seem to have no filters and they say what's on their mind as it relates to Chris and other like him.  They act like they're supporters of the black cause, but their attempts to help end up doing more harm than good.  Their attempts end up making the group they claim to support just as uncomfortable as someone who might be against them.  The funny thing is that they probably think they're being progressive and open-minded.  Like I said, it is uncomfortable, but it's very effective in that there are people out in the world who act exactly like these people.  They're unknowingly ignorant.  Though, in the case of this film, there's nothing unknowing about these people and their behavior.  Given the nature of the film and the introductory character (Andre) later being seen at the party acting completely against type and with a woman 30 years his senior by his side, naturally, theories start to pop into your mind.  There's this supporting character, Rod, who provides most of the comedy in the film, that mentions that they're making black people into their sex slaves.  Rod takes this theory to the cops at a later point in the film and they just laugh at him.  That's not what I had in mind.  My theory was that these black people were being reconditioned or 'retrained' to act in order to act how these white people feel that they should act.  I don't wanna say that the reveal has SOME of what I theorized, because I couldn't have theorized what I actually saw, but there's hints of it here and there.  Having said that, I still don't think you're gonna figure it out.  If you're going in blind, at least.  The movie is so intelligently-written that even the smallest little scenes can be seen as cleverly keeping the mystery going without really saying much.  For example, the whole bidding scene played out in silence, since they didn't wanna tip Chris off to what was happening.  It's a surprisingly sinister little scene, because you don't know what they're actually bidding for, you just know that they want Chris for something.  The fact that they don't say anything at all during this scene is, really, one of my favorite things about it.  At some point in the scene, Chris has conversations with Georgina and Logan (the missing Andre) and there's something clearly off about them.  For example, they'd be calm and collected while talking with Chris, but then they'd be just a little part of them that would literally be fighting as hard as they could to tell Chris to just go and get the fuck out.  And, again, these scenes are just fantastic.  Like, for example, Betty Gabriel, who plays Georgina, is just incredible in how she struggles to say what she wants versus remaining \"true\" to the family.  It's a battle of wills, so to speak, and it is one of the biggest clues in the entire film.  Oh and I also forgot to mention that Chris was hypnotized the day before the party by Rose's mother.  This is where he reveals his past of his mother being in a hit-and-run, dying from her injuries, while he was at home watching TV, not calling the cops.  It's why a certain moment in the climax plays out the way it does, even though you're just begging Chris to leave.  It also explains the deer at the beginning.  This brings us to the reveal of what these white people do with these missing black folk.  I'm not gonna say what they actually do, but it's such an amazing reveal, because it provides you with knowledge that completely changes how you view the movie, for the better.  Now, with this information, if you do decide to watch it again, you know what to expect and you can pick up the little details that you may not have noticed the first time out.  Maybe even clues that you didn't pick up at first.  But, to me, it works even better than that, because now, with what you know, when the party starts taking place, you (the audience) are one of the partygoers in that you know what's gonna happen to Chris, but you are unable to say anything.  Not because you want to keep it secret, but because you can't.  No matter how hard you try, Chris won't react.  This could also be interpreted as saying that us, the viewers, are as much trapped in the sunken place (you'll know what it means) as Chris was when he was hypnotized.  There's a reason why the view in the sunken place is shaped like a screen, whether that be a TV or a movie screen.  In the sunken place, Chris can still see through his own eyes, but he's unable to do anything about it as the sunken place weighs him down.  Definitely metaphorical in that, again, having viewed the film, you can say that you are as much a character in the proceedings as anyone else.  Perhaps that's overstating the point, but I do feel that parts of it are very true.  Once again, we are all stuck in our own sunken place whenever, however and wherever we watch this film.  We are not in control of our actions when we view the film.  It's some truly deep shit that actually makes you think about your own actions in society.  Like how many times have we seen stuff in our own lives that we could have put a stop to or attempted to, at least, and we haven't done anything.  This movie gets into you and it doesn't let go.  It truly is a thing of beauty.  The acting is tremendous, there's very few horror movies that have as strong of a cast as they do here, but they did a great job at casting everybody.  Absolutely everybody here delivers on their end of the deal.  Though, to be fair, they had an incredible script to work with.  The climactic act itself is absolutely out of this world great, so goddamn satisfying.  The alternate ending on the DVD is poignant and makes you think about the justice system in the country, but I'm glad that they stuck with the original, more hopeful ending.  Like, really, I hate to almost gloss over this, because the movie does have an incredible climax, but I felt that this offers just so much more than that.  The only thing that I was struggling with as I wrote this review was whether to give this 4.5 or 5 stars.  I'm going with FIVE FULL STARS.  This is my first one for Letterboxd, but it's my first one for RottenTomatoes since, I think, Gravity.  I saw Gravity the day before the Oscars in 2014.  This one I saw the day of the Awards.  It's a pointless little tidbit, but there you go.  In conclusion, as corny as this may sound, you don't really watch Get Out as much as you experience it.  Rarely have I seen a movie that makes you such a part of its world, its story and its characters as this one.  It's impossible to just watch this movie and not become a part of it, whether you even wanted to or not.  You are just as hypnotized as Chris was.  You are a part of this world, for better or worse.  This is a movie that forces you to think and re-evaluate some aspects of your life, at least if you're one of those people the film targets in its satire.  And even if you're not, it makes you think about real-world issues and how to resolve them.  It also offers an experience that's deeply layered in that it welcomes repeat viewings to find out more about what its world has to offer.  This is a movie that will, sadly, be often imitated.  Duplicated, however, I find that to be highly unlikely to ever happen.  This is a special movie (not to mention amazing too) and it deserves to be seen.",

The lead actor was good in the part (yet again Brits showing Americans how it's done) nicely shot and directed by Jordan Peele. It was good in the fact that it broke stereotypes putting an Afro Caribbean actor in a role that's generally reserved for white women. I'm afraid that's it on the positive notes. This movie was a reworking/theft of the original 1975 Stepford Wives a far superior film in its time. Jordan Pele the director admits that he reworked that film changing gender to race. That's where the film is spoilt especially surrounding the hype. If you saw Stepford than around the halfway mark you'd have guessed the outcome leaving a taste of being cheated in your mouth. All in all a very average movie and tbh not Oscar worthy without the interference run by Will Smith and Spike Lee it wouldn't have been nominated. Was cabin in the woods nominated? A filmfrom the same genre that was vastly superior? No because it still wasn't worthy of an Oscar nomination and there was no race cards being played.",

But not strange enough - the parents accept the young black photographer with ease and the lovey dovey ness seems unforced. Then stuff starts happening. The tie back to reality is Chris's friend Walter who works for the TSA. Turns out, these often scoffed at pseudo cops get a good enough training as Walter and Chris make unlikely heroes.\n\nI won't spill any more of the beans - you can see it coming, but it doesn't matter. Jordan Peele's direction from his own script is faultless, and in young Brit-Nigerian Daniel Kaluuya, a star is born. Everyone in the cast is pitch perfect.

The film violently awakes the audience to the threats around the main character through its use of \"hidden symbols\" such as when Chris tries to capture a photograph of Logan using the flash on his cellphone. The use of a cellphone was an obvious nod to the importance of documenting cases of police brutality in America. Another instance of \"hidden symbols\" is in the scene when Chris is strapped to the chair and is \"literally\" forced to pick cotton from the arms of the chair. The overarching theme of the film is systematic racism and the power it holds in the lives of the characters as displayed through satire. The director Jordan Peele pushes the envelope with his use of hidden symbols to keep the audience crouching in their seats throughout the entire film.  I recommend that everyone who is able to go see the film to do just that because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to see the darkness of racism shown in the light.

Jordan Peele portrays racism in a way where it seemed to be extreme, but people took notice. This movie should win best picture in the 2018 academy awards because it portrays racism in a hidden way, where people do not notice it just like in our society today. The movie shows a great example of this when Chris goes to visit their house and they are throwing a small party. They make small comments to Chris like if Obama ran for the third time I would vote for him. They were trying to make Chris feel comfortable, but really it was an awkward situation for him in the movie. The white people in the movie are not aware of stereotypes and think holding them are okay. They are still being racist to Chris when saying things like this.

It certainly deserved to win the nomination of best picture because it accurately addressed the controversial issue of racism in America. I understand that my experiences will never come to be as significant in history as the brutal centuries of abuse that African-Americans went through, but hopefully I can still inform the audience that the movie Get Out deserves a watch. For example, Peele remained tasteful in his method of storytelling through the way the scenes never over-exaggerated the issue of race. To put that in perspective, it is completely opposite to Logan Paul's method of storytelling when he posted a video of him joking about a suicide victim's body in Japan. Race is a sensitive topic because many people have misinterpreted in to be something that can be disrespected. Daniel Kaluuya, the main character, represents the mental thought process of African-Americans when people are being racist. There were instances where he suffered paranoia at the thought of people getting into his mind at the hypnosis scene, he got upset but kept his composure when people said impolite things, and he reacted uncomfortably when Betty Gabriel (Georgina) or Marcus Henderson (Walter) would not pick up the cues of comradery. I was moved by Chris' emotions because they were clearly articulated. The audience is meant to experience the varying emotions portrayed in Chris to understand a bit more of what African-Americans experienced. Chris' emotions made it easy to connect the main story of hypnotizing people and then being used as a human puppet to America's history of enslaving African-Americans. By analyzing Peele's method of storytelling, and using Chris' emotions as a reflection of what African-Americans experienced, it successfully adds to the discussion of racism in America, and deserves to be watched.",

Horror-Comedies (or Hor-Coms?) are a thing now and this is as good as the relatively young genre gets. It's inclusion by the Academy is either a sign that younger people are flooding into the Academy or it is the Academy's way of saying, \"We hear you,  Millennials. We're cool, too.\" That's not to say that it didn't earn any of this recognition. But a Best Picture and Best Director nod? I don't think so. I heard that this movie was, \"OMG! SO GOOD!\" and it was in my eyes, just \"Good.\" The hype surrounding this movie wasn't due to its inherent quality (see: Allison Williams' performance), though. It was about originality. It's a fascinating concept and what could have come across as too Sci-Fi-leaning or campy comes across instead as an entirely fresh dialogue on the horrifying depths of racism and white society's ability to control black society. Outside of Williams, the core cast is superb and I hope this film makes Lakeith Stanfield a star. The script is strong, but again, only up for Og. Screenplay based on freshness of perspective. Get Out is a...cool film. I say that because it didn't knock my socks off, but I ended it with a smile and the whole thing just felt...cool. I'm glad this movie is getting some recognition because it could signal the beginning of a very fascinating Directing career for Jordan Peele and it's bound to stick in the public consciousness longer than other films this year. But, if it walks away with any major awards, I'll be disappointed.",

            "content": "Jordan Peele's brutal satire of American liberalism is a film that I can quite happily say was one of my favourite of 2017. Get Out is a fantastic film, beginning almost as a modern retelling of Guess Who's Coming Dinner but soon venturing into the darker waters of suspense horror, which is sharply executed by Peele. Daniel Kaluuya stars as Chris, a young black man whose white girlfriend, Rose (played with expert zeal by Allison Williams) takes him to meet her parents (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener), where Chris discovers a sinister plot beneath the surface of hospitality. The plot is not original (quite a few movies do come to mind that the film clearly magpies from) but, in execution, it feels fresh and suitably terrifying, Though I would not label the film as an out and out horror, the tension built up throughout the film is genius on behalf of Jordan Peele, who, as a first time director (who would believe it?) succeeds in layering the film with subtle nuance and subtext that only compliment the whole package. Cast-wise, Kaluuya is excellent, carrying the film as the likeable and intelligent Chris, but also providing us with moments of tenderness and emotion that make him well-deserving of an Academy Award nomination. Allison Williams is equally fantastic, playing off nicely with Kaluuya, as is West Wing alumnus, Bradley Whitford, who feels slightly robbed of screen-time but remains great in his performance. Caleb Landry Jones' character as Williams' drunken and violent young brother hits and misses; though he is decidedly creepy at points, he becomes somewhat hinderous in the third act, The real gold of the supporting cast, however, comes from Catherine Keener, as the matriarch of the family; Keener's performance, particularly in the acclaimed hypnosis scene is wonderfully chilling and perfectly executed. The film does deter slightly in its brutal third act, which isn't bad, but the filmmaking feels less clever in comparison to the rest of the film. Of course, that's one high bar. Michael Abel's score is also fantastic, contributing to the atmosphere of the drama.\nOverall, Get Out is an outstanding debut for director, Jordan Peele; creepy, tense and actually often suitably humorous, this film is a gem of the horror genre, blending within its action a strikingly relevant message",

What I found was a refreshingly unique horror film that ,while slightly predictable, offered a compelling plot with great performances.\n\nThe Pros: Daniel Kaluuya as well as the supporting cast all give phenomenal performances (with the exception of the Jeremy character, who seemed merely passable in most of the scenes he was in). This film also has one of the best build-ups out of any horror movie I've seen; roughly 75% of this film is dedicated setting up the horror-based segment, with every plot point adding up and coming together over time. This film also sets up a looming atmosphere that only gets creepier over the film's runtime. \n\nThe cons: As stated earlier, the film plot is fairly predictable despite it's originality. There were a few minor twists that left me surprised, but for most of the movie I knew where the plot was going. However, my largest problem with the movie was that it I didn't feel it was greatly effective as a horror movie, it was more of a suspense-thriller.\n\nFinal thoughts: Overall, this movie was a memorable horror movie experience that I will not be forgetting soon. This was one of my favorite movies of the previous year and I will keep this movie in mind when the Oscars approach.",

There were a few unexplained plot points however.  For example I want to know who left the box of pictures conveniently in the closet with the open closet door beckoning Chris to come look. And how did his friend the TSA agent find them? That all seemed a little convenient. I definitely do not understand why this is nominated for an Oscar.

It's more of a \"Twilight Zone\" type of story.  Peele wisely pulls the audience into the racism aspect slowly.  Daniel Kaluuya, as the protagonist, Chris, is really solid in this movie.  He is very believable and has a great screen presence.  The other roles where more bland.  However, one actor lit up the screen.  Comedian Lil Rel Howery, as Chris's buddy TSA officer Rod Williams, provided outstanding comedic scenes while harpooning Hollywood horror tropes, especially ones related to black actors.  The movie zipped along but was mostly predictable.  The climax was fairly abrupt and rather derivative.  It was disappointing for me in the end.  I've been told that the theater experience was better.  A good effort, though the Oscar buzz perplexes me.  Jordan Peele looks to have a fine directing/writing career ahead.

The third act does get abit too conventional following the film's craziest twist and some elements of the plot are rather predictable. But this is one of the better, sharpest horror thrillers to come out in recent years; I highly recommend it as long as you go into it without knowing anything about it. - 8.5/10",

Also, getting so much hype for the sake of the subject only is dishonest, it's cimematic virtues are excellent but not THAT unbelievable.

He became famous largely in part to a brand of comedy that finds humor in stereotyping characteristics of particular races. \n\nThe movie is not even subtly racist. Towards the end, the main character asks \"why black people?\" The evil white guy responds with something like \"athletic, cool, hip, etc. etc,\" basically stating that white people as a race are inherently envious of black people as a race, which is where all racism towards black people from white people has stemmed. From envy. \n\nYes, it is possible for something to be racist EVEN towards the majority race in a country. EVEN in a country that has been historically unjust the other way around. Should some \"eye for an eye\" racist movie be up for a best picture? Take the fact that it's racist out of the equation. Should this BAD of a movie be up for a best picture? Not in reality.

There was already time for suspense and horror films wanting to leave a mark in popular culture with films that were due and a few that really exceeded the average (It follows, The witch, It comes at night), but GET OUT really brings us back to the pacific and ideal american way of life to make it shred in favor of the show. We return to the dreamed suburbs, those perfect streets full of leafy trees, incredibly designed houses, the American dream come true portrayed in a successful model and caucasian family who are visited by the eldest daughter, who along with her African-American boyfriend plan to be the weekend in such an ideal place. The anguish is growing up from here, the racial phenomenon and the prejudice to it guarantee a trip little seen before from this perspective. Excellent all, from secondary where it highlights an unusual comic relief to the protagonists, of which Daniel Kaluuya dazzles in an intelligent and very gullible performance. There are no rules or morals in a world where the wild human nature shines its most fervent self-fidelity.",

            "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD: Overall, \"Get Out\" is a clever approach to racial tensions and it accomplishes many of its intentions.  As a satirical piece, it is well done and certainly conveys a message while providing overall entertainment speckled by notes of dark comedy and suspense.\n \nHowever, it is the racial divide in itself that provides a flaw to the film. If you remove the obvious racial aspect of the film and analyze the plot, characters, and storyline, you discover that the race issue of the film is simply there as a superficial issue that never actually cements itself as necessary to the plot other than to make racial commentary for the benefit of the audience.  There is never a clear justification as to why the Caucasian characters are specifically targeting African Americans for their procedures. There is a suggestion from the Armitage family and their Caucasian cohorts that it is the strength, agility, and youth of the African American characters that is needed. Now let's consider if the character, Rose, brought home a 25 year old, virile triathlete who was of Asian descent...would the Armitage's have declined him? They would have no reason to have declined him. He would possess all of the necessary qualities they required. So why did it always have to be an African American person?\n\nNow with regard to the \"transitional\" medical procedures, this group of Caucasian people are using this medical procedure to recapture youth, virility, strength, longevity, etc. so after all that effort and such a precarious surgery, why would they want to be, in all effect \"reborn,\" as someone in a position of servitude? For example, Grandma and Grandpa Armitage went through the procedure with the hope of regaining strength and vitality, yet we are expected to believe that Grandpa hoped to gain all that strength and live out his life again chopping wood and using a manual mower? We are expected to believe that Grandma wanted to live in her new skin pouring iced tea? Once they are young again, why not travel the world or climb Mount Everest, or accomplish all those things they couldn't do anymore because of their age or physical deterioration? Grandma has her skull cut open and mind transferred into a new body, and all she wants to do is wear a grey uniform and Swiffer the house? Is the whole reason they undergo these procedures only because they all secretly wanted to be housekeepers and gardeners? I doubt it. So what was the endgame of the transitional procedures? Once again, I am left to wonder, why did it always have to be an African American? Since Grandma and Grandpa Armitage were Caucasian their entire life, why didn't they target young Caucasian people for their procedures? It would have been a less conspicuous transition and no indication is given as to why they felt that only African American people would be suitable for the transition. \n\nIt would seem that the racial aspect of the film does not actually serve to drive the plot in any particular direction. The plot could have progressed in a similar fashion regardless of the ethnicity of the targeted group. Whether they were African American, Asian American, Caucasian American, or Hispanic American, the story would have been the same.  The racial preferences are employed solely for the effect of social commentary for the benefit of the audience but there is never a necessary justification at any point. The racial juxtapositions remain literally and figuratively \"black and white.\" Although the film is entertaining, has suspenseful moments, and accomplishes its social/racial message, it is lacking in the depth necessary for a complete standing ovation.",

There is a slow reveal about the Armitage's ulterior motives.

Such as old people forcibly swapping bodies with younger bodies.  Or handicapped people forcibly swapping bodies with able-bodied people.  Maybe it's a good thing that it most likely won't spawn a sequel.

Daniel Kaluuya is riveting in his scared-to-death sequences (especially the first time when Catherine Keener hypnotizes him) and what really gets you here is that, so is the audience. Get Out is of course Jordan Peele's show in every frame but it is more of the Jordan-the director and not Jordan-the writer, for even though being familiar with the concept or idea the audience seems to fall into his world within the first act which was actually shot more beautifully and with excellent detailing for Jordan knew that this is the part where the audience may go off track and after the movie has surpassed the first act and the introduction of its creepy world and dreadful characters, the premise of the movie will easily favour in for the rest of the acts. Besides Daniel there is very little of the other cast to perform on or project themselves to that range so it resides within his territory and he has taken care of it, nicely. Get Out is smart, a bit shady and surprisingly filled with stunning violent sequences which ups the ante a bit and boosts the movie to the whole new level where it plays off in the major league against the action sequences of the movies like The Revenant and The Atomic Blonde.",

            "content": "I've noticed a pattern in recent years, where a filmmaker makes their directorial debut with an ambitious, well-crafted horror film which speaks to the cultural zeitgeist while also being scary as hell. In 2014, it was Jennifer Kent's The Babadook. Then came It Follows the following year from David Robert Mitchell (not his first film, of course, but perhaps the first to receive such box office success). Last year, it was Robert Eggers' deliciously creepy The Witch. Now there's Jordan Peele's Get Out, a horror/mystery about the horrors of racism, where turning people into objectified stereotypes brings deadly consequences. The best horror films take our individual fears (death, sex, loneliness, the unknown) and cultural sins (greed, lust, apathy, hatred) and manifest them into material monsters, turning abstract unease into concrete terror. The material(istic) monsters of Get Out are rich, suburban white people. I know-they freak me out too.\n\nGet Out follows Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose (Allison Williams) as they prepare to spend a weekend with Rose's family. Its opening scene sets the tone as a young black man (Lakeith Stanfield) is abducted by a masked figure driving a Porsche in the New York suburbs. Based on this introductory moment, as well as the spoiler-ish trailers and the film's very title, the trajectory of Get Out is not particularly surprising as the weekend spirals into creepiness and violence. Akin to The Stepford Wives or Rosemary's Baby, the film focuses less on jump scares and more on psychological dread compounded by weird social behavior. Chris feels like there's something amiss the very moment he sets foot on the property, yet social propriety and his desire to please his attractive girlfriend keep him from saying or doing anything. There are awkward conversations about race with various family members and party guests, as well as bizarre behavior from the few black folks in the neighborhood, namely the maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and groundskeeper Walter (Marcus Henderson). Despite being surrounded by so many people, Chris's isolation becomes increasingly pronounced, his only source of hope and comfort coming from his goofy friend Rod (Lil Rel Howery), a TSA agent who suspects that Rose's family is up to no good. When Lakeith Stanfield reappears midway into the film with a much different demeanor and outfit than we saw in the opening scene, the audience wants to scream the titular phrase at Chris before it's too late.\n\nI loved the excellent narrative pacing, strong performances from the entire cast, and Peele's use of horror movie tropes and present-day racial tensions to heighten the audience's unease and expectations. The film will be deeply uncomfortable and scary in different ways for different audience members. For the black community, they will likely empathize with Chris' entire unsettling experience, perhaps reveling in the final moments of vengeful violence. For a white audience, their discomfort may come from recognizing the white characters' racist tendencies in themselves, as well as the devastating finale. For myself, as a Hispanic man who is more often than not recognized as white, I found myself somewhere in the middle, deeply aware of the rift between ethnic communities and unsettled by the film's conclusions about such rifts. As someone who holds to a Christian ethic of nonviolence, yet also appreciates many tenets of liberation theology, the film forced me to wrestle with personal questions about seeking and promoting justice and liberation through peaceful means when the systems in place only compound the violence and seem to demand violent upheaval to be changed. Are violent means ever appropriate for achieving peaceful ends? What does justice look like in such situations? Regarding justice, there are two a key scenes in Get Out involving police cars approaching Chris and Rose, and a tension arose in me: what would the police officer do in that moment? Peele's decision to include those scenes at significant moments in the story is such a smart directorial choice, as well as a reminder that the conversation around civil rights isn't always very civil.\n\nSpoiler Alert: I'd like to examine the ending and the themes of Get Out, so I discuss those in the following paragraphs:\n\nWhat I think is most interesting about Get Out is that it's not as much about racism as audiences may think, even after the reveal of the monster(s). The wealthy white people, led by the Armitage family, are not as interested in hurting or enslaving black people, per se, as they are in simply using healthy human bodies for personal gain. The white people objectify and use the black people's bodies, a new system of slavery and bodily abuse. I was reminded of Ta-Nehihi Coates' Between the World and Me, his thematic focus on the view of the abused black body in American history. Yet the motives for the white people in Get Out, as explained by Stephen Root's blind character, are to be cool and fashionable, to be athletic and strong, to have what they currently feel like they're lacking (despite seemingly already having everything). \"I want your eyes, man,\" Root tells Chris. \"I want those things you see through.\" It's a misguided reverence towards Chris, a recognition that the black experience is distinct from the white experience, a unique resource/knowledge which, in the elite class's view, needs to be appropriated for their own advantage. Yet Root makes it clear that it's not because Chris or the others are black (though how much should a person believe in a white wealthy megalomanic's worldview?), but that they have assets, resources, even freedoms that the Armitages and their community feel like they lack. I think Get Out's cultural critique is not so much of American racism as it is American capitalism, a system which, regardless of its ideal construct, continues in our present context to benefit the wealthy elite while stifling the middle and lower classes, especially people of color. This is a critique of waging war and invading Middle Eastern nations for their oil, of running a pipeline through Native American lands for the sake of jobs, of claiming to only \"buy American and hire American\" while building a personal empire and brand on foreign funding and backdoor deals, of promoting capitalism as inherently liberating when it enslaves human beings to the market and turns them into consumers rather than persons. Racial injustice and rampant capitalist consumerism certainly are not strange bedfellows; one only needs to examine slavery in the Antebellum South to see the connection. I think the most subversive message of Peele's film is not simply turning the tables on white people-it's upending the entire American cultural system and myth of progress. The protagonist is named \"Chris Washington,\" linking the Messiah of Christianity and the first American President in one moniker. In this, Get Out compels the viewer to consider his or her own Sunken Place, the arenas of life where they live with a sense of powerlessness, feeling stuck because \"that's the way things are.\"\n\nGet Out invites audiences to open their eyes and wake up from the hypnosis of distorted cultural narratives. Yet the question remains: what should we do when we have finally woke?",

            "content": "Generally considered one of the best movies of 2017, it's rather safe to name 'Get Out' as the best horror film of the year. It's only real competition would be 'IT', maybe 'mother!' (it's proven to be rather divisive), and if you want to count it as a horror film, 'The Shape of Water'. Excluding IT, there is actually a theme linking these recent horror successes. They each have more to them than simply being scary. Whether it be a message you can interpret, dazzling visuals or splashes of comedy, they each bring something else to the table.\n\nThis review shall contain spoilers. I do, however, highly recommend the film. If you haven't seen any trailers, I'd recommend you keep it that way; many of the highlights are teased within them. With that said, spoilers shall be below. Proceed with caution.\n\nDirected, surprisingly enough, by Jordan Peele, famous for his hilarious sketch comedy, Get Out is a genuine surprise. Based on the director, I'd made the assumption that this film would be a generic horror comedy, presumably relishing in over-the-top jumpscares and gore. Instead, what I found myself watching was somewhat of a mystery. Jordan Peele himself said that the film 'can't be put into a genre box', and he's right; it could arguably be a horror film, a suspenseful thriller, a comedy, a mystery or a pretentious commentary of race relations in America. Mercifully, I didn't interpret it as the latter.\n\nOriginally conceived following Barack Obama's second election, the film tackles a subject of race-relations rarely noticed: the opposite of racism. And I'm not talking about 'reverse-racism'. Many white characters in this film actually love black people so much, they want to become them. Knowing it was written during Obama's second term, that makes sense. Watching it now, with President Trump in office, gives it a different spin. Regardless of how you interpreted the antagonists, they were probably the most 'human' villain in horror in recent memory. Ignoring some questionable science, they were depressingly human.\n\nThe cinematography was a pleasant surprise. Shots, while rarely astounding, strongly added to the mood. Throughout the film, they felt as though they were getting closer, until we are unable to escape the situation we've been thrust into. Also, at times, we can see background characters watching our protagonist without his knowledge. Tension is present throughout, whether it be due to a nervous comment we aren't sure how to react to, or somebody brandishing a weapon, the audience can rarely relax, leaving you tired when the credits roll.\n\nThe characters are each rather interesting. Obviously, the family is all rather one-note, but they play that one note so sweetly, I can't bring myself to complain. The exception to this is Rose (Allison Williams). This character shifts so jarringly, I briefly thought it was someone else in her body. Daniel Kaluuya's portrayal of Chris was also wonderful, and rather believable. Ultimately, the featured roles stole the show, however. Both Marcus Henderson and Keith Stanfield were brilliant, but Betty Gabriel's Georgina was flawless. While the 'saying things in an overly happy way to be creepy' trope has been played out a bit, the cast in this film manage to make it unsettling again.\n\nMy main issue with the film is that it doesn't seem to think the audience is particularly bright. Much of the racial 'undertones' are forced upon us, lest we miss the point of the film. There's also occasional recaps of past events in conversations between Rose and Chris. The audience doesn't need to be told why something is awkward, or strange; we can work it out. It's both more rewarding for the viewer, and saves time in the film. This comes to a head when Chris finally works out what's going on. We see literal flashbacks to previous events, as though we'd have somehow forgotten the things we'd seen half an hour prior.\n\nWith that said, however, it does highlight something that pleases me greatly. This is a mystery you can actually solve if you're paying attention. It's teased earlier in the film that the family's grandfather was not only a runner, but that he lost to a black man. It's not too large a leap to find the character's envy. Perhaps others are like this? We also learn the parents' occupations rather early, too. The party scene is utterly littered with clues, to the point of it becoming painfully obvious looking back.\n\nTo conclude, I feel this film was an exceptionally successful film. With a budget of merely 4.5 million dollars, Jordan Peele has told not only a highly enjoyable horror (or thriller, or comedy..) film, but an interesting commentary on society today. It also manages to avoid persecuting the viewer, regardless of their race, as I feared it may end up doing. I am quite happy giving this a high 8/10. If you're looking for an alternative to a crowd-pleasing horror film such as 'IT', I recommend Get Out. At the moment, the film has made a profit of 250 million dollars at the box office, and it deserves every one of them.",

            "content": "A tense horror film with highly imaginative style and humor.\n\nJordan Peele's directorial debut Get Out (2017) is a brilliant horror-comedy that satirizes interracial relationships, racism, ignorance, and black anxiety. Peele creatively writes Get Out with a strict social commentary underneath the scary plot. Peele's writing is clever and funny with neat references to how white people actually talk or make excuses for their racism in subtle ways. Peele flips awkward family encounters a Guess Who's Coming to Dinner situation into a surreal nightmare akin to an episode of The Twilight Zone. Peele's fears of white encounters and manipulation are fascinating in Get Out. His commentary makes for hilarious jokes and awkward conversations. I think the comedy aspects are very strong in Get Out alongside the thoughtful social commentary.\n\nFor the horror aspects, Get Out finds fear in its audience by forcing the viewer to bear witness of a helpless black victim and it's horrifying! Peele draws equally from horror classics like Rosemary's Baby, The Stepford Wives, Eyes Wide Shut, Deliverance, The Most Dangerous Game, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, The Twilight Zone, Under the Skin, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. \n\nFurthermore, Peele blends the feeling of no agency in Rosemary's Baby, the replacement concept from The Stepford Wives, the secret society from Eyes Wide Shut, manipulation into the dark world from Under the Skin, the crazy family from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the ignorant rednecks from Deliverance, as well as the human hunting with a rifle from The Most Dangerous Game for an all new horror staple for this generation. Peele wears his influences on his sleeve, yet finds a way to make Get Out feel completely fresh and unique while you watch it.\n\nPeele's direction is intriguing with Toby Oliver and Denson Baker's striking cinematography, especially in their close-up shots. The arthouse vibes during The Sunken Place sequences are too cool and beautifully shot. You feel such a visceral suspense as Kaluuya is stuck in the chair. Gregory Plotkin's editing during the Bingo sequence is phenomenal as you slowly realize it's actually an auction. I adore Peele's choice of including some hip hop into the soundtrack as well as a more traditional sounding horror score from Michael Abels. The romance drama feels like a wonderful indie drama, while the horror is striking anxiety build-up like few modern horror movies can muster. Jordan Peele is a director to watch out for in the future! \n\nDaniel Kaluuya delivers a formidable performance of endearing likability, tear-jerking anxiety, horrifying shock, intense helplessness, and surreal suspense. Chris Washington in Get Out will likely remain Kaluuya's greatest role as he is so complex and nuanced with every expression and look. Kaluuya gives his whole body and soul in Get Out.\n\nAllison Williams plays a sweet persona well as Rose Armitage, while leaning into a deadly lure role. Her cold personality reveal is so shocking as Williams plays the start so sympathetic and warm. She's quite nerve wracking during the key searching sequence or the finale rifle chase. Her hurt cry for help at the end is just the most apt depiction of a white person running to the police to save them from a black person ever. Her unfeeling voice change and cruel taunting to Chris is revolting. Allison Williams is so chilling in Get Out that I doubt viewers will ever look at her the same.\n\nCatherine Keener is haunting with her dispassionate voice and creepy tea sequence as Rose's mother Missy Armitage. Bradley Whitford finally gets a great role as Rose's father Dean Armitage in Get Out. His overly warm welcome to Kaluuya's Chris is hilarious, but his personality reveal is so dark compared to his cheery persona as Rose's father.. Caleb Landry Jones plays Jeremy Armitage, the ignorant violent brother to Rose. He is simply marvelous as the most monstrously sadistic family member. Stephen Root is disquieting in a fearsome portrayal of the blind art dealer Jim Hudson.\n\nMarcus Henderson is so uncanny as the white sounding gardener Walter. His final resolve to end the Armitage's reign of terror is deeply moving in a brief moment of triumph. Betty Gabriel delivers a powerful turn as the maid Georgina. Her tears as she cries out \"No\" over and over again is perhaps the most memorable scene in Get Out. She is startlingly affecting in Get Out. Likewise, LaKeith Standfield is moving as the first victim, Andrew Logan King, we see to the Armitage family operation. His silly white sounding conversations with Kaluuya's Chris are too funny until his character's breakdown due to a camera flash. Stanfield is suddenly devastating.\n\nLastly, I have to mention my favorite character in Get Out, the comedy relief TSA agent friend Rod Williams as performed by the laugh out loud funny Lil Rel Howery. His exclamations and conspiracy theories are a send-up to the audience trying to guess what is happening, while also adding a Red Herring aspect thanks to his theories and conjecture.\n\nIn all, Get Out is an unforgettable experience of tense situations elevated by Jordan Peele's gorgeous direction and poignant writing. The acting in Get Out is truly transcendent.",

Jordan Peele's directorial debut has horror, humour and plenty of social commentary. It's refreshingly original, and at the same time has a lot of fun playing with classic genre conventions. In fact, Get Out reminded me a lot of The Twilight Zone...so it now makes perfect sense that Peele is working on a new version of the groundbreaking series. The performances are universally terrific, the script is extremely smart and timely, the film builds tension and suspense extraordinarily well, and Peele has cemented himself as an exciting new voice in the genre. Get Out is one of the best, and boldest, horror films to come out in quite some time. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "It's fascinating to see the polarizing effect this movie has on viewers.  To dismiss it as old rhetoric is missing one of it's most brilliant points, which (I believe) is that the issues of racial tension extend far beyond the duality of extremists in opposition.\n\nThe film portrays many important points with grace (if not subtlety) and delivers consumable packets of social commentary very successfully, particularly in it's first half.  The antagonists' evil plot was not (in any way) portrayed as representative of their race, though much of their casual behavior leading up to the climax is used to bring up some poignant examples of subtle racial aggression.  One of the most telling indications of the film's intent is the protagonist's acceptance of the awkwardness and stresses he encounters as he gets acquainted with the family, his eagerness to allow for what he takes to be well-intentioned awkwardness, and his willingness to applaud his girlfriend for her apparent efforts to defend and sympathize with him.\n\nThis movie isn't about racial hate in a well trodden way, but instead takes a particular and little-discussed facet of it and uses it as a fulcrum upon which to overturn the audiences expectations in a successful and entertaining way.  Race is absolutely a central topic of the plot and the antagonists represent many points on a spectrum of harmful behaviors and attitudes.  There is no denying that Peele is seeking to express some nuanced observations, and I feel he achieved that gloriously while avoiding any accusations of villiany against any broad racial group.  In fact, as the plot intensified it was more and more clear that the family were far from a typical example of their race.  If anything, they utilized a camoflage of predictable racial tension to hide the horrifying truth of their intent.\n\nTo accuse this movie of being poorly executed would be a gross misjudgment.  To accuse it of pandering to racial aggression against white folks would be reactive and unobservant.  It was a bit of comedy, a bit of science fiction, a feast of careful human observation delivered with impressive dexterity, wonderful cinematography, an effective soundtrack and ovation-worthy performances.  Most of all it was intensely thrilling and entertaining.  To an audience prepared for a bit of poignant social commentary and big thrills, I cannot recommend it enough.",

There was heavy use of dramatic music to try and build tension but in the end there was no helping the blocky script and a plot line so far fetched I wasn't sure if we were meant to accept the premise as one based in pseudoscience or enter into a world of nebulous surrealism, engaging in the suspension of disbelief. It was all rather muddled and leaves the audience unsettled by too many unknowns and with a consequent apathy toward the plot.

The plot is simple enough at first, girlfriend brings boyfriend to her place for uncomfortable meeting with her family. Sure, basic enough. But Jordan Peele has constructed a film that is anything but basic.\n\nThe interracial couple in and of itself can make people uncomfortable, and the ingratiating of a white family to the daughter's black boyfriend can also be its own thing easily. What Peele does is merge those two, and makes every seemingly accepting scene cringe-worthy no matter what race you may be. If you're white, the white people are embarrassing you. If you're black, you're feeling the discomfort of being in a place like this, and wondering if there isn't something underneath the apparent good words.\n\nIn that way, Peele encapsulates our society. White people invoking Barack Obama's name as though it gives them credibility among black people, for instance. Through each scene, you begin to wait for the other shoe to drop, and wonder what exactly it means when it happens.\n\nWhen it does, the film brings the slow boil to a raging inferno, and the connections make themselves in a way that creates great suspense and terror until it all reaches its inevitable crescendo. Peele has, as such, built a perfectly frightening movie, and with its deep societal roots, it is intelligent, and its timeliness ensures its excellence and a historical place.\n\nThe acting is stupendous, and the twists are crazy good. The comic relief that Rod provides as a goofy TSA agent is a great counterbalance that not only taps into the comic genius that Peele is, but provides the viewer a momentary respite from the immediacy of Chris's plight.\n\nSee this movie.

The medical basis seemed rather flimsy, but was not discussed too much and so did not impact on my suspension of disbelief sufficiently to derail the plot. There are two main problems with it for me. First, everyone was acting so blatantly suspicious. Perhaps this was meant to show how secure and confident they were, but it just appeared stupid. Second, I find it very implausible that someone can be hypnotised against their will, as shown here, so a lot of the plot was a non-starter for me.

Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams turn in very nice performances, and the supporting cast is solid as well.  I loved Lil Rel Howery, who plays the friend, a TSA agent who tries to help from afar.  There are many great moments - the round of \"Bingo\" led by the father, Kaluuya seeing the pictures of Williams and her expression on that last one, and the effects going to the \"sunken place\".  It also puts a mirror up to how white people in real life, even well-meaning ones, sometimes talk to African-Americans in their attempts to relate to them or 'be cool' - stilted, with references that often bring up race, and at least sometimes subtly racist.  How great it was to see a diverse cast, and to see this perspective, without it being delivered in a heavy-handed manner.

            "content": "I watched Get Out a long time ago (I guess it was in May), but I re-watched this one yesterday and I thought it was worth of a review. \nThe movie begins as the typical \"boy meets gf's parents\" movie: \"Do they know that I am black?\". And then the Jordan Peele builds all the movie's plot around this concern from its leading man.  \nGet Out succeeds not by trying to be extremely original or adding never-seen before elements to the plot, but it succeeds thanks to a writer/director that refuses overthinking and decides to include a social satire in it: Obama was the best president or \"Black... is in fashion\". What happens next... made me hold my breathe. \nDaniel Kaluuya delivers a star-making performance in Get Out. He's an imposing figure (visually speaking, he's really tall and big, with a real dark skin), but he's also a commanding lead! He transports the audience through his journey with him, side by side - he's the secret ingredient that makes this movie work so beautifully. Plus, he has a very expressive face and makes for an intense use of his physicality - a star. Allison Williams sure is a pretty face and a nice presence on-screen, but who highlights the supporting cast is Betty Gabriel with an exquisite scene-stealing \"strange\" performance (she's a question mark until the very end of the movie). Catherine Keener also delivers a great \"psycho\" performance and LilRel Howery brings some welcome laughs. \nA standing ovation for the score and how it is used. An amazing combo of the composer's and director's works. In fact, Jordan Peele does an incredible as a screenwriter and as a director and emerges as one of the most promising directors working today. This is his directorial debut and he accomplishes something many directors can't in a lifetime: elevateing something simple by adding a relevant social comment. \nAn horror movie with substance, Get Out doesn't push many boundaries, but it succeeds as one of the best American indepent horror flicks in recent years.\n.\n4,5/4\n.\nOriginal review: cinemaandpopcorn.blogspot.pt",

The scenario may be an outlandish bodysnatching conspiracy, but the subject is everyday and familiar. The police are either co-conspirators with the bodysnatchers or part of the institutional consensus that criminalizes black bodies. Either way, a black man standing over a bloodied white woman is in trouble when the police pull up, and everyone in the audience knows it. \n\nGet Out is an education for white audiences and, perhaps, a documentary for black audiences, as Peele has suggested. Before he introduces explicit elements of horror into the film, Peele allows the microaggressions to mount. Whereas allegories risk the distance of interpretation, Get Out doesn't code racism as anything other than what it is. Nearly every line of dialogue, every gesture, every insinuation relays the uneasy politics of race-relations. \n\nThus, the horror doesn't emerge from a vacuum. These aren't the actions of deranged malcontents, isolated, shut off from society, ensnaring victims unfortunate enough to stumble into their little world. The horror arises from a familiar place, lurking in plain sight, yet hidden behind facades of self-conscious interactions and pseudo-progressive politics.\n\nGet Out indicts the supposed welcoming spaces of white liberalism, and, in so doing, implicates the theater and the white audience members who've come there to exercise their esteemed cultural enlightenment.\n\nPeele tools this pervasive entrapment that is the black experience as not only the film's subject but as its formal register, as well. Few actors have been hounded by such an insistently watchful camera. Daniel Kaluuya, who plays Chris, is under the microscope-the camera poised for that one false move. In this way, he and Chris are mimetic twins. They share the onus of making everyone around them feel comfortable with their presence.\n\nCan Chris keep it together? Can he hold our sympathies? Be gracious? Level-headed? Understanding?  \n\nKaluuya shoulders that burden. Full-center in the frame, staring back, he reflects to us the torment of constant surveillance. He's trapped, a deer in the headlights, and we, the audience, just hope to god he can get out alive.",

The storytelling is especially well-done and has a Shyamalan-like feel; slowly turning a normal situation into something frightening and bizarre.  However, the political theme of the \"post-racial lie\" is a bit muddled and doesn't really add much to the film (which works better as straight horror).

While I did not hate the movie it was hurt by some formulaic plot devices and some glaring factual errors.  The scene where Chris' friend reports his suspicions to police and the police just laugh at him, was the best example.  Since there is a kidnapping involved, police are required to look into it regardless of whether or not they think it's true.  Not doing so could lead to serious repercussions such as civil and even criminal lawsuits.  Also, I doubt TSA has that much power.

It's not that they don't get irony. It's not that don't get kitsch as something to laugh _at_.... but it's that they don't get _really_ genuinely liking kitsch...  where say, I have a collection of Pez dispensers because I actually love them, sentimentally, not because they are silly and ironic trash, though they surely are silly trash, no despite that.... childhood lives there in the cheapness and I connect to it.  Some folks can appreciate a parody of a genre, but not a knowing celebration/embrace of the genre. Get Out isn't a parody of  B horror, not even a satire of B horror... it's a lovingly made actual B horror film with a biting, beautifully nuanced, both very broad and very subtle social satire on race fully and in my opinion 100% satisfactorily woven into the B movie.  As a result, if you really genuinely have no affection for B movies Get Out doesn't work.  Real masterpieces  aren't made out of cheap materials in my opinion and Get Out isn't deathless art, (how many movies are? a dozen? two dozen? three? mostly European and Japanese, too)  but it succeeds brilliantly at what it sets out to be: funny, horrifying (the harmless kind), satirical and  thought-provoking about race relations, and it accomplishes it all without seeming to try very hard.",

            "content": "99%? I'm about 99% certain this film is trash. \n\nThe glowing reviews for this film really do baffle the mind. I understand that it's satire, I understand there's a message about race, but does that mean it warrants such a good reception? It's almost as if people have convinced themselves this is a good movie just because it deals with race. \n\nLets start with some positives first - Kaluuya does well to remain tasteful in this otherwise utterly ridiculous film, unlike the rest of the cast he's grounded and most importantly believable. Also, given that he's an English actor, this role has to be out of his comfort zone, so credit where credit is due - he's a bright spark in an otherwise awful film. \n\nNow the bad -\n\nTo actually hear that people think this film is 'great' is genuinely astounding. To the people who think this film is good, I'd like to ask them what they actually think is good about it?\n\nWas it really a challenge for Peele to satirise the Horror genre? A genre notorious for its poor writing, acting, character motives and well worn cliches? Is it really admirable to mimic a terrible film that well that it appears to be genuinely terrible? I wouldn't say it is. Not at all.\n\nThis is not a good horror film, it's surprising anyone but an extremely casual cinema goer would think that is - it's an intentionally bad horror film, hence the fact it's called satire. The ridiculous premise, over the top cliche script/characters, acting and cinematography make this all too obvious. So for those of you who enjoyed this as a horror film, I have to ask how? How can people enjoy bad acting, cliche writing and obvious jump scares if they call themselves genuine horror fans? The answer is that genuine horror fans don't like this film. The only way you can enjoy this under the lens of the horror genre is that it's ironically bad. The horror motifs in this film are purposely bad - over the top acting from the 'grandparents' who you assume are brainwashed from the off, the evil brother whose acting is god awful, the over the top/obvious cinematography (such as the repeated close ups on the tea cup during the hypnotism scene), the body snatchers trope - not one single horror motif is new or carried out well in this film. It is all purposely bad. So for those of you who genuinely enjoyed this as a horror film - you are basically objectively wrong by the director's standards and his intentions. \n\nHow can any kind of atmosphere be built when something is so ridiculous and cliche? It can't. The point about cliche is that its been used so often that it's lost its effect. How can the filmmaker expect to build tension when nothing can be taken seriously about its horror conventions? The fact that people are comparing Peele to Hitchcock is blatantly absurd in light of this. I found myself laughing out loud at almost every scene in this film because it was so purposely terrible, so cliche, because the script was awful and poorly delivered. No genuine horror fan would find this film tense or frightening, nor would they find it refreshing in terms of its conventions which are satirical and purposely cliche and therefore have no effect unless used wisely and sparingly. \n\nThe only unusual or remotely unique aspect about this film is how it 'explores' race. In other words, in order to enjoy this film, you can't enjoy it as a horror film - not unless you enjoy shoddy acting and a cliche script/storyline, or unless you're a complete hipster who wants to enjoy a film that's ironically bad - but it isn't and achievement to make something that's purposefully bad unless you can create something intentionally good in the first place, and that's much more of a challenge. \n\nSo to enjoy this as a horror film you have to be extremely resilient to worn out cliche/tropes that are barely renewed with race plastered over the top of them, or you have to understand that this film is purposely awful and enjoy that ironically. \n\nSo if you are a film buff to take this as a serious piece of art that isn't only a massive cliche that is almost terrible in every regard, you have to like what it says about race.\n\nAt first, though I didn't see eye to eye with the director in terms of his intended message, I didn't think the message was genuinely bad. Having thought about it more the message - that liberal whites who like black people, black culture and sympathise with black social issues, are actually a problem - I think it's a pretty poor message for several reasons. \n\nI understand very liberal people will scoff at anyone's disapproval of that message as being borne out of white privilege, but I'm sorry, you can't just dismiss people's lived experience like that, it's just alienating to do so. That said, I imagine very liberal people will have very little time for any white person who's alienated by this film's message and herein lies the problem. But at a time when the US is fraught with genuine racism, the film's message seems frivolous at best. In fact i sympathise with people who've commented here that this kind of criticism can be construed as divisive and counter productive. \n\nI've always cringed at the alt-right use of the word 'cuck', but when I see the way this garbage film has been lapped up just because it deals with race and liberal white people well I have to kind of agree with the premise. After all, the white people who love this film must clearly agree with the message and enjoy deriding people who aren't even genuinely racist. \n\nSome people might argue that liberal white moderates are a problem because they agree with the issues black people face but aren't intent on making it their cause - I'd argue that alienating those people is only going to make it worse. While I don't think this film is put across in a serious enough manner to do that, I can't agree with the message it puts across. Critics must take the message that seriously though - because when you look at the film as a whole, the racial aspect of this film is the only thing that can be given any kind of weight. \n\nThat said, I just can't agree with the message. Morally I could passionately get behind Django shooting the men that violently oppressed him, but not the idea that misplaced admiration for black people is evil or even particularly harmful on any meaningful level.\n\nSo to cap it all off, I'm sorry, but I think this film doesn't deserve anything like the ratings its received. I'm sure half of you think people like me have either missed the point or that I must be a big scary racist. I didn't miss the point. The film is purposely terrible and its message is supposed to be its saving grace. In actuality its message is quite controversial and I believe that some critics only think this film is good because they agree with the message, others are probably afraid to call it for the trash that it is because there is a pressure to agree with the premise of the film or else some people will assume you're ignorant or bigoted on some level. Sorry, but I'm not bigoted, I'm a moderate white liberal and I'm calling this film what it is - rubbish.\n\nIn short, nothing about this film is brilliant. It doesn't deserve its plaudits.",

            "content": "This highly successful debut film by writer, producer, director Jordan Peele is a modern horror classic. Daniel Kaluuya is a young black man with a white girlfriend (Allison Williams) who travels to upstate New York to meet her well-meaning, liberal, upper class family. Underneath a veneer of inclusion, Kaluuya discovers the family's sinister intentions as the black people he encounters there are servants, who appear to have been brainwashed. (It's the perfect metaphor for how black Americans are subjected to conforming to white society.) Peele has crafted a suspenseful thriller with sharp satirical overtones, explicitly targeting white liberals, that has more to say about race than perhaps any other contemporary movie. This is one of the rare movies to express a vivid sense of the fear black people feel in the presence of white people in America. Peele is unable to transcend the conventions of the genre as the final act dissolves into horror cliches, but the black humor, paranoia, and craftsmanship earn the movie comparison to classics like \"Rosemary's Baby,\" \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\" and \"Carrie.\" With Bradley Whitford, Catherine Keener, Caleb Landry Jones, Marcus Henderson, Betty Gabriel, Lakeith Stanfield, and Stephen Root.

            "content": "The movie \"Get Out\" is thrilling\nBy Adam Shaw, 10/23/17\nIf you are looking for a thrilling exciting, mysterious movie, get out is perfect for you.  Get Out is directed and written by Jordan Peele who was born and raised in the city of New York. Get Out was released on February 4th, 2017, and was on DVD May 23rd, 2017. The film stars Daniel Kaluuya who plays Chris Washington and Allison Williams who plays Rose Armitage. This film is one of my favorites because it has a weird but unique story line to it. \n\tAt the beginning of this movie we meet the two main characters, Rose and Chris. Chris is an African American who was into photography and Rose is interested in the same thing, and they happen to fall in love. The movie starts straight from when they are dating, but later in the movie, we find out what really is going on. One day Rose wants Chris to meet her parents; nothing wrong with that right? We later find out that Rose's family has all black people \"working\" for the family. Rose's family seems really strange and weird, but Chris tries to do his best to be a respectful man. We are introduced to Dean, Missy, and their son Jeremy Armitage. The Armitage family is very wealthy and seem to be very proper in how they do everyday life.  One night when Chris gets up to get a drink of water, he walks upon Rose's mom Missy Armitage. She soon hypnotizes him into a floaty unescapable being where she can make him do whatever she pleases. He ends up getting out of it, and questions are popping out of his head to Rose about the occasion. After a few days at Rose's parents' house, he sees and hears some weird strange things that don't seem right. All the black workers seem to be misdirected and not all there in the head. In one scene, one house servant comes out of his hypnotic being and screams to Chris breathless \"Get out!\" which of course is what the movie title is called. Chris finally realizes that Rose and he need to get out of the house. While trying to leave Chris walks upon some pictures his girlfriend Rose is in. All he wanted after that point was to get out of the house. Long story short, he ends up getting out and finding rescue by his buddy Rod Williams who is played by LilRel Howery. \n\tWhile watching this film I had questions from the beginning to the end. I loved how they developed each of the characters in each part. One thing that stuck in my head was when they got to Rose's house and everything was acquired from that point on with each person. The house seemed like it was haunted and Chris could tell it wasn't right.  I liked this film from the beginning because we all knew at some point it was going to get interesting, and it gets interesting fast. \n\tHaving good strong characters is one main thing in making a movie good and memorable. Get Out had mostly the same characters in the whole movie but it didn't get dry or boring at all. The characters were also very realistic and had a special element to them. Chris and Rose had a realistic view to their dating life instead of it seeming unbelievable.  The acting in this movie was excellent and how they shot it was unique. There were a few times where the camera shots needed to be perfect in order to get that creepy feel to the plot. The music elements fit perfectly with the movie and flowed well with the story. Sometimes movies will have too much music or not enough, but Get Out had just the right amount. \n\tI would fully recommend this movie to anyone because it has cliff hanging moments, it had scary moments, and it had unexpected twisting moments as well. This movie is rated R, because of violence, bloody images, and language, but I think it could have been rated PG-13 for some violence and language. If you are looking for a mystery movie to watch with your girlfriend or friends, \"Get Out\" is a perfect pick.",

My biggest critique is that we don't care about any of the characters, we don't know anything about them and that makes it hard to really care about their fate.

The third act goes full-on psychological horror and even gets to give the comic relief friend a sense of purpose. If there's one thing I love in these type of movies, it's the protagonist getting to destroy the evil in the climax. There are five visual puns relating to black and white in one scene, can you spot them? For a movie called Get Out, I wasn't compelled to leave for any reason whatsoever...why did that sound a lot wittier in my head? Get Out gets rid of such mundanities as jumpscares and shaky camera in favour of more subtle frights and a social commentary that's every bit as thought-provoking as it is humorous.",

            "content": "Written and directed by Jordan Peele (one half of the famous comedy duo Key & Peele) Get Out was a film that had intrigued me long before viewing due largely to it's sensitive subject matter, a strong supporting cast, the prospect of an original horror movie and the curiosity of the capability of what calibre of film a comedic star could produce when switching genres completely.\nThe film centers around Chris (played superbly by Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend, Rose(Allison Williams) as they embark on a weekend away to meet Rose's parents Missy and Dean for the first time. At first, Chris reads the family's overly friendly behaviour as nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to reveal a truth that he could have never imagined. \nOn first viewing (and this film deserves repeated viewings) Peele's first dabble in the world of  directing is an unprecedented success and a piece of highly original film making that deals with social and cultural issues so cleverly that the viewer is left deep in thought as well as scared out of their wits whilst also finding time for the odd chuckle! It is in fact, this skill that Peele manages to interweave all these varying emotions and genre types in to one piece of cinema that is his greatest triumph in Get Out.\nFear, horror and unease are the real winners here however, as this film avoids all the usual horror film cliches and plays like a cross between a top notch Twilight Zone episode and The Stepford Wives (I mean that as a compliment!) which will frighten and shake the viewer to their very core and leave those uneasy emotions there for days! A Triumph!",

Of course it has jump scares, but that's not really what makes the movie a part of the horror genre. The horror is in putting yourself alongside the main character, and seeing their experience. First with the cop who treats him unfairly, second with the parents who make off-hand remarks that hint at their racial insensitivity, and later with the reveal of the hypnotism. It uses mystery and intrigue to draw you into the lore and the background, and shakes you to the core with the very real aspects of humanity we see in the \"horror\" characters. To be honest, while the real ending certainly relieves the tension in the movie, and leaves you feeling satisfied that Chris makes it out alive, the real impact is that when you think Chris finally is free from the horrors of illegal brain transplanting and mind-control, in the alternate ending, he gets no happy ending. Rod doesn't save him, and he's ends up in jail for self defense against a family of psychopaths. And yet, the horror is the ridiculuous plot's parallel to reality. The parts of it you can see in day to day interactions. That's the real horror to me, and its what makes this movie one of a kind.",

I haven't had to walk in the shoes of a minority like that so my view on this is of course from the outside.\n\nI don't understand how its determined a comedy/horror movie. There were a couple of amusing parts but the whole thing reads like a horror movie, a very well written, well directed, well acted horror movie.\n\nThe movie itself is a slow build up from the beginning. The actual action of the movie only starts towards the end, but Peele's story keeps you enthralled anyways. I really found myself liking the main character Chris and I was rooting for him the whole movie. His girlfriend Rosie wasn't my favorite as a character, but the actress did great herself it was just the character I didn't like.\n\nThe hero of the movie to me though was Rod. He was pretty funny, and maybe that is why they call it a comedy, but I found he stole the show for me.\n\nThe trailers are pretty straight forward with the story, but you will still enjoy it and there are still surprises. By the end of the movie I didn't trust white people and I pretty much embarrassed to be white by the end, although in full disclosure I don't really trust white people anyways and am embarrassed by them regularly, but that is beside the point.\n\nI can't recommend it enough that people should see this movie.\n\nThe good: I was impressed with how much the story stuck with me. It was full of great acting, directing and writing and I would be happy to pay theater prices again to see more of Peele's stuff if he does this type of horror again.\n\nThe bad: Nothing bad that I could point to.",

Whatever its message it, it's coming from a very dark, unpleasant place, and the film packs in so many clever references, instances of foreshadowing and subtle hints that it would take several viewings to note them all. Peele expertly mixing tones, with some scenes containing a complete shift in mood out of nowhere, creating an atmosphere of constant paranoia and deep foreboding. The plot is what would likely happen if Alfred Hitchcock decided to make Meet The Parents, and the relatable situation that quickly spirals out of control is constantly engaging and also perversely fascinating. It loses its footing somewhat when it feels the need to spell out exactly what is going with an expository information video, but what comes before and after is some of the best filmmaking I've seen this year. Mr Peele asserts himself as a cinematic force to be reckoned with, and we can hopefully look forward to seeing more great material from him in the future.",

In Brandon Harris's review \"The Giant Leap Forward of Jordan Peele's Get Out,\" Harris explains this film's undeniable importance to today's society by analyzing the film's metaphorical meanings, and also bringing this film's history to light. Harris recalls the horrific moments that stick with the viewer, such as when Chris \"...discovers that black solidarity, all hints of the cultural traits that he assumes [Logan] must be familiar with, have been ground out of him\" (6). Here, Peele shows how tight of an emotional hold that racism can have on the black population, and emphasizes the crippling effects of a lack of opportunity. Later, Harris also outlines that \"Peele spent many years trying to get financing for the movie ...\" (2) and that he believed its official release to be \"impossible\" (9).  This shows that the very underlying racism addressed in Get Out is affecting Hollywood, as this genre of movie is so difficult to produce. Racism still and has always been a restricting problem in America, and Harris's review helps bridge the gap between the realistic and fictional aspects of the film revealing the movie's importance in the progression of black cinema. Get Out is significant, in that it represents a blunt assessment of the crippling racism that is still present in society.",

The overall story of this movie was very interesting and knowing that it came for a director doing this on his own for the first time was also interesting. All the actors in the movie did a very good job as well. I really liked the main two characters in this movie. The lead black dude did a very good job of playing his role and didn't come off too naive like other characters in similar movies. His girlfriend was very convincing in her role too. And her actions kept me pondering through the whole movie. My only small nitpicks with this movie comes at the beginning where I felt the characters weren't subtle enough and everything felt a little too off at the beginning. I think it would have been better if things were played a little bit more normal and started to gradually get more weird. I also think the movie could have been a little bit longer. When I was just starting to get into the story it was already starting to wrap up. I kind of wish they could have spent a little bit more time in that environment and played with the themes a little bit more.  but other than that I liked this movie a lot.

Not sure wtf that was... First of all why and then to think that enough well heeled people could be brought together with that inclination in the first place. If two people with the same desires along these lines met randomly at any point in their lives it would be beyond shocking. Talk about a race based ego trip. No we don't all wanna be black! \n\nThen she called the black guy her grandpa at the end lmao ??\n\nAnyways I'm still giving it 4 & 1/2 stars cause it was really good all the way until that point. Except for when he drew the conclusion that the maid must have a crush on his girlfriend because she disconnected his phone. That's a little bit of a stretch of the imagination. Maybe something more broad like \"These people seem upset about something\" \n\nOr how he got the impression that the demented groundskeeper was interested in his girlfriend. That didn't make any sense.",

            "content": "Review:\nThis is one messed up film! Now that I have finally watched it, I can understand why some people found it quite disturbing but the ending brought some justice to the whole messed up situation. Daniel Kaluuya plays a black photographer, Chris Washington, who is in a happy relationship with his white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams). They decide to go to Roses parents house, and he soon realises that they have a weird outlook towards black people. With a black woman and man as there servants, and various statements about his colour, he bites his tongue and he attends there annual party, which also leads to more racial comments. When Chris finally decides to leave, he is faced with an unbelievable situation which leads him to fight for his life. I was definitely shocked with the outcome of this movie, and I wasn't expecting the various twists and turns throughout. It's not everyday that you see a film were the black underdog, triumphs with all the odds stacked up against him, so I have to give the director the thumbs up. The ending seemed a bit abrupt, and it does take some time to get going but once it does, you can't fault it for originality. Personality, I would have got out of the house after the first day, especially after seeing how weird the servants were but I can understand that he was in love with his girlfriend, which is why he was willing to put up with ignorant behaviour from the messed up family and friends. Anyway, I enjoyed the movie and it's definitely worth a watch. Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis is the first movie directed by Jordan Peele, 38, who is known for his comedic series Key & Peele, alongside Keegan-Michael Key. The shock success of this movie, brought him to the main stream, and with Keanu also doing well at the box office, the only way is up for the dynamic duo. Although Daniel Kaluuya isn't a household name, he has starred in Cass, Welcome to the Punch, Kick Ass 2, Sicario and the series Skins, so he has had some experience in front of the camera. He definitely brought some intensity to the project, and it was good to see him use his brain towards the end.\n\nBudget: $4.5million\nWorldwide Gross: $252.5million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/mysteries, starring Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford, Caleb Landry Jones, Marcus Henderson and Lakeith Stanfield. 7/10",

Any horror fan will point out that this isn't new, but what is new is that this film is not hiding the metaphor. This film is about racism, it's blunt as hell about that and it has so many moments that just hammer that home (The term Slaves is brought up a lot, there is literally an auction scene, it is not subtle). This is what we need, this is the horror films that we need in the new era that we're living in.

While the subtly accurate monstrous portrayal of the certain antagonistic skin provokes your thought on the social functions from the filmic perspective that makes up the horror genre portion and contributing to the overall creepy effect, it only got limited to be shown as implausible from the medically twisted procedure with slightly exaggeration from the hidden hatred.

            "content": "I've been flustered with the way movie trailers are being edited nowadays. Coupled with cheesy sound effects and too many cuts, they've become very formulaic; an equation, if you will. The trailer for Get Out capitalized on my skepticism of the modern trailer. Takes from the trailer are shot completely different from the final product. Subtleties like this altered the genre almost entirely, going from what appeared to be a cheap B-movie to a horror film with something to say. The trailer set a tone for the movie that was deceptively different from the final cut. Thankfully, the final cut broke away from what the trailer had me expecting. Genre bending is what makes Get Out so unique; mostly horror, part social commentary, with a hint of humor. In his directorial debut, comedian Jordan Peele knows how to convey his fears onto the big screen with grace. Daniel Kaluuya does a fantastic job in the lead as Chris, a black man with a white girlfriend on their way to meet her upper-class family. Interactions are extremely awkward from the very beginning, with the parents and friends constantly commenting on his race while attempting to make him more comfortable, giving it the opposite effect. Kaluuya makes us feel right there with him, as a stranger in a strange land. Chris is isolated, and as the viewer I felt that as well. Chris's living at the estate is essentially Peele's commentary on what he feels like to be the only black man in a room full of white people; and it's filled with claustrophobic anxiety. Despite the excellent acting, beautiful cinematography, and high-stakes tension, the twists were relatively foreseeable. In the end, Get Out's final act had me on the edge of my seat. Ignore the trailer and try to avoid yourself from forming any preconceived notions (such as it being a B-movie comedy, which it wasn't) and enjoy the ride.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Well, Greg, it s time to get out the old review pad and review this next movie.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Get out of town - let s recap...\n\nSCOTT: The story begins with a Meet the Parents-like scenario. Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is about to meet the parents of his girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams). Chris is concerned because Rose hasn t told her parents that he s Black, but she assures him it won t be an issue. They arrive at the home of Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener), and Chris notes the odd behavior of the African-American couple, Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Georgina (Betty Gabriel), who work for the Armitages.  \n\nGREG: Chris is especially worried about Rose s mother, Missy s occupation - a hypnotherapist. He doesnt trust therapists at all and hypnotists least of all. Missy promises to cure Chris of his smoking habit. Later that night, when Chris is craving a cigarette, he goes out on the lawn for a smoke. He encounters the lawnkeeper going for a sprint. When he goes back inside, Missy is there stirring a teacup in a way that causes him to go into a hypnotic trance. She makes him relive his mother s death when he was a child. It s a chilling moment for him and for the audience.  \n\nSCOTT: Greg, Get Out is both odd and oddly enjoyable. The movie taps into a great fear that many of us have involving the meeting of a significant-other s parents. We want everything to go well, and so good storytelling demands that things go poorly. In Get Out, everyone Chris meets at his girlfriend Rose s house is either slightly  off  or very much  off . And it gets worse with time, leading one to wonder why Chris (along with every family in every haunted house movie) doesn t run fast and run far much sooner than he does. Despite operating from a predictable formula, this movie strays cleverly from it by focusing on racism in its ugliest forms. I was never able to quite figure out why horrible racists would want the consciousness of their loved ones to inhabit the bodies of what they consider to be racially inferior people. The racists seem to dwell on the so-called size and strength of African-Americans, but it still defies logic that white supremacists would perform this surgical procedure. In any event, the story follows a common pattern but does so in a fresh, albeit bizarre fashion, and the overall cinematic result is strangely enjoyable.  \n\nGREG: To elaborate on what you re talking about, Scott, we have to let our readers in on the secret of the film: the aging white population of Rose s family is killing black visitors and exchanging brains with them. So, the elderly white folk are inhabiting the young bodies of such people as Chris whom Rose is enchanting and bringing home to their demise. It s a sort of Invasion of the Body Snatchers with elderly white folk as the pods. The story gives director Jordan Peele an opportunity to expose white racism by putting Chris in the  special world  of the fish out of water. And by fish I mean a black man and by water I mean a sea of elderly white folk. It s both embarrassing and embarrassingly funny to watch Rose s family touch Chris s hair, comment on his genetics, and praise Black celebrities ( I voted for Obama twice ).\n\nSCOTT: Chris follows a good hero s journey, being thrown into bizarre and dangerous circumstances. Unlike most hero stories, Chris receives no help; he s totally on his own, although we can t discount the assistance from afar from his pal Rod (LilRel Howery) back home who IDs Logan, the missing musician from Brooklyn. More than anything, Get Out is a story of survival, much like Gravity and the final act of Silence of the Lambs. The hero finds him/herself in the proverbial belly of the whale and does what it takes to basically not die. In terms of transformation, there is certainly a series of sinister physical transformations taking place at the Armitage s residence. Does our hero Chris transform during the story or as a result of the story? He certainly must summon up courage and resourcefulness to extricate himself from the dungeon of doom in the basement. This type of transformation in times of crisis is common in the movies (and in real life). We never see how Chris becomes a changed man in the aftermath of his ordeal, but we can infer with confidence that he s forever changed.\n\nGREG: With comedy and horror, story structure often gives way to shock value. Director Jordan Peele is half of the comedy duo of Key and Peele who have made a career of poking fun at racial issues. Both come from interracial families and have seen racism  from both sides, now.  Get Out is the culmination of Peele s comedy career and with it he continues to mine racism for humor - and now horror as well. So, it s no surprise when no one in the movie really transforms. Chris is probably scared straight on white women - or potentially romantic relationships - for a while. He s pretty much the same guy at the end of the film as he was at the beginning. However, the audience rose in cheers when Chris finally breaks his bonds and skewers Rose s brother with the antlers of a stuffed deer. There was definitely some catharsis for the viewers in my theater when he transforms from prey to predator - taking out the whole family one by one.\n\nSCOTT: Get Out shocked and entertained me for two hours, thanks to numerous creepy and memorable characters plus a grisly secret kept by the family whom our hero is trying to impress. The racism in the film was blunt and discomforting to a comic extent, which was probably the intent of the filmmakers. The performances by the cast were excellent and the storytelling was solid, despite the family secret defying logic from their racist perspective. I award this film 3 Reels out of 5. The hero s journey was bold and required a fierce independent spirit for our hero Chris to survive. It is a true story of survival requiring courage, resilience, resourcefulness, and necessary brutality. My only complaint is that Chris takes a little too long to ask Rose if they could leave the house. The minute that Walter, the groundskeeper, came at Chris at full speed at 3am at night was the minute that Chris should have hightailed it home to safety. But he stayed and paid the price, thereby treating us to a horrific ordeal from which he escapes. I give his heroism 3 Hero points out of 5. There isn t much in the way of overt transformations in this film, other than the obvious physical mutilations carried out by Dean and Missy Armitage. As I ve mentioned, Chris couldn t have extricated himself from the horror of his situation without transforming mentally, emotionally, and physically. These are the types of transformation we discuss in our latest book, and they happen when real world heroes confront emergency situations. Still, we never see Chris as a changed man after his ordeal, and so I can only award 2 Transformation deltas out of 5. Movie: Transformations: Heroes:\n\nGREG: Get Out is an uncomfortably comedic horror film. It s said there is truth in comedy.  Surely the funniest moments in the film were of white people saying stupid things in the presence of a black man. Both white folk guilty of such moments and black folk who are subject to them feel a sense of discomfort that gives rise to humor. The image of white people taking on the bodies of black men and women may be a metaphor for white people adopting black culture: minstrels in blackface, tap dancing musicals, rock and roll music, and modern rap are all examples of how whites take on black culture and make it their own. And in so doing rob blacks of their own cultural identity. For holding up a funhouse mirror to American racial culture, I give Get Out 4 out of 5 Reels. In the typical horror movie, the protagonist commits some social sin (say, teenagers having sex, drinking alcohol, and smoking pot). Then they go somewhere they should not be going (say, into an abandoned house). And must pay the consequences (attack by an axe wielding madman). Chris is just such a character. He s defied social norms by dating outside his race. He is transported to a scary mansion where he meets the evil family looking to rob him of his brain and his life. It s not what I d call a hero s journey, but it is a classic horror plot. I give Chris 3 out of 5 Heroes. As we ve discussed, there isn t much transformation going on in Get Out. This story isn t so much about transforming the characters in the movie. But, perhaps, the people transformed are the viewers. We can laugh a bit at ourselves and become more aware of our latent and subtle racism. And so we can transform into more aware individuals. I give Get Out 3 out of 5 Deltas for transforming the audience. Movie: Transformations: Heroes:",

Within the inane conceptions in which we coexist, there are black dots and white dots, which keep homologous appearances and similar inner properties, only differentiated by the nature of their pigmentations. Since years ago, it has been stressed the aggrandizement of a subjugation tendency that directly affects the dark dots, which have consented the permanence of subjugators' actions without any retention. With the passing of time, circumferences have had a few reconciliatory encounters, of which emerge vainglory about the overcoming of this abject phenomenon that has whipped them from the beginning, what proves to be a vile falsehood, since many of the black dots admit this new freedom under a latent tolerance yoke, indulgences toward the acts of the white ones that flaunt a full liberation of the racial differences , when the only thing they are achieving is to bury the problem under a thin soil layer. And so, the inescapable incriminating question: whom should we blame? the whites who don't want to confront and eliminate the root cause of their mistakes or the blacks that continue to allow it? I think that it's not an imputation matter, the weight of the racial problems lies in the circumferences of all kinds.\n\nDiscrimination, in all its possible variables, is a matter with which it's possible get very far both in extension and intellection, an issue that has touched various medias in terms of attacking this puppet of such evil purposes. Basing on a sad-popular behavior such as racism in the United States of today, filmmaker Jordan Peele-who gained status by TV shows of a comic nature that with the accustomed dubious quality achieved American transcendence-presents a sour, fiery and impetuous social satire brimming with black humor with delicious psychological thriller hint that arrives in order to impact strong on a certain well-off sector thanks to a reflective tale of the big little lies that we tell each other in such a clever, effective and commercial way that might well gets it a list of meritorious titles as \"cult film\" or \"the best suspense movie of the year\" and maybe, a round of accolades for its splendid components, identical in quality, different in appearance.\n\nPeele's feature film converges, in not few vertices, with the laudable allegorical representation (\"The Invitation\", 2015) by American filmmaker Karyn Kusama, highlighting as the main concomitant the essence of the true thriller: increasing discomfort and vulnerability sown in order to audience does not feel security with what happens on the screen, which provokes in this incessant birth of perceptions toward the loaded questions posed by the story. A genre equivalent to a perverse roulette, in which in the slightest moment of carelessness, a rush of revolutions can shake your safety from head to toe. Such concordance adorned with an acute social criticism, consubstantial of the authentic films inaugurated by Mr. Hitchcock, in which are exhibited the most poor actions that we can come to commit, we, who are the black and white dots.\n\nWhile it builds outstanding psychological game with detailedness, Peele, deserving of double mention acting as scriptwriter and director, conjures up ordinary components and other unusual that can be abridged in three major fields: the first one, of course, is the narrative, although beyond wise skill of developing the subliminal core idea, it's the successful combination and harmonization between two discordant genres as horror and comedy, an impressive achievement especially in the decadent film period in which we are in. While comedy is based on the supporting comic relief gags (contradictory and stereotypical a black man) and irony of the situations, it's fascinating as horror doesn't require scary monsters or spooky entities to fulfill its objective (although there are), here, terror springs up from dread and the veiled significance of the words, from confrontation with the harsh reality. The second one is plausible constituents at technical level, namely, its mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, soundtrack, cinematography and photography that unite the vertiginous final act with the hesitant first act using, as usual in Jason Blum's company, precise elements that facilitate and enrich the following of the story. It's prodigious in the composition of its images, having in its power a vacation home encircled by a dry forest is not a brake, on the contrary, it's sensational as they create beauty, usually in confined spaces, with what they have. With certainty, the film has conceived one of the most beautiful shots in horror film history, an oneiric picture where Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) jolts awake after a cyclic hypnosis in a pale leather sofa, with the sound effect from an old TV as the only company, his face-tremendously photographic-raises an analogy through the melodramatic tears in his exorbitant eyes, a frame that will last in the memory of any modern cinephile. There are also sparkling scenes, which reach horns of the moon in its exciting third act, highlighting vigorously camera focus in the third major factor: the overwhelming and heterogeneous performances. Kaluuya's role radiates power and strength, he's sensitive and unprotected when he needed, aggressive and lethal when everything is a disaster. The alienation of the Armitage family is dosed between the competent actors, from which stand out Allison Williams (with a twist plot worthy of Shyamalan) and her brother in the fiction, interpreted by Caleb Landry Jones. Exclusive attention requests scene stealer Betty Gabriel, who plays a couple of shocking scenes, with dimensions of complexity and interpretative depth typical of an acting matron. Be careful because this lady and Kaluuya will present great surprises.\n\nConscious of its game, Peele's motion picture is a deliberate subversion, offered by the hand of cinema, which cries out for the eradication of injustices perpetuated by the social and political sects of the Trump era. It also breaks supposed barriers between genres and ideas and overflows creativity and power by creating situations as exciting as cartoonish, as intelligent as reflexive; A satire that wasn't requested, perhaps out of fear, but in the end it came with a relentless purpose. It achieves what many feature films don't: surprise and affect.",

            "content": "In American society, black people can exercise equal voting rights with white people. Past laws prohibiting marriages between blacks and whites have been amended and black slave trade has long been lost in history. Many laws and institutions in the present American society treat blacks equally with white people. Rather, because of the fact that many black people are in the poverty line, American welfare policies are numerically more black than white people. Racial discrimination has become a thing of the past. \n\n\tHowever, is black people really getting the same treatment as white people in current American society? People know how ignorant and childish racism is, and the human rights of black people are protected nationally. How can racial discrimination still exist in this situation, but discrimination remains. If the past discrimination was straightforward and explicit, the present discrimination is implicit and ingenious. Discrimination did not disappear. It just evolved intelligently. The movie 'Get Out', a directorial debut by comedian Jordan Peele, a racist satirist, tells him well.\n\n\t'Get Out' is a horror film about a black photographer Chris going to greet his white girlfriend, Rose. Chris is afraid that he will admit herself at Rose 's house because he is black, but Rose takes Chris to her home in a secluded spot. However, Chris is strangely nervous about the negative emotions that Rose often reveals in his family's view. It turns out that his family, including his girlfriend, Rose, was a racist family until he was a black man. It is the moment when the substance of the strange anxiety felt by Chris is revealed.\n\n\t'Get out' represents another horror than the existing horror movies. And differentiates it from films that deal with racism. This is the reason why the 'get-out' has been praised for being the best and has attracted world-wide popularity and empathy. Ordinary horror movies are usually reproduced through brutal scenes such as horrifying disguised ghosts or murderers suddenly popping out, surprise the audience, torture or murder. But the way to get 'get out' makes the audience feel scared is through the expression, the gaze, and the eyes of the performers. When the family of Rose showed off their cold and determined aura of expression and gaze when they looked at Chris, and when they looked at the complex facial expressions such as anxiety, fear, sadness, The movie reproduces fear. It expresses a subtle new fear.\n\n\tThey pretend not to be discriminators on the outside, but they are strange. It was a bigger discrimination than I thought. This is the most realistic and accurate answer to how racism can still be the most powerful fear topic in the current American society where black slavery is abolished, the marriage of blacks and whites is achieved, and the right to vote for blacks.\n\n\tDiscrimination is still remnant, overriding improved systems as serpent. In the face of new discriminations that cannot be said, ordinary people do not make clear their discrimination. Discrimination is more profound for both the perpetrator and the victim, and is still wandering the air between the people.",

            "content": "I know I am a little late to the party, but I just had to see what all the fuss was about for Get Out, Jordan Peele's debut on the silver screen.  I wish someone would have goaded me into watching this sooner because it was a refreshing delight to see a smart and surprisingly entertaining take on social taboos in the form of a thriller/horror/comedy.\n\nPeele seemed out to subvert expectations.  It's almost as if the audience knew going in exactly what was going to happen throughout the remainder of the film from the first scene, but even though we see almost everything coming, the routes Peele leads us down take us along paths filled with laughs, awkwardness, disgust, and elation.  In Peele's commentary during the alternate ending, he talks about making this movie during Obama's administration, but then things flipped when Get Out actually arrived in theaters.  One of the characters played by Stephen Root, a blind older man, actually has one of the lines of the film that perfectly helps the audience understand why anything in Get Out is actually happening.  He can't see color, therefore we as an audience are expected to believe his words can land with a heavier blow seeing as how ignorant all the other white people are around this one black man.\n\nThere is a simmering anger lying in this film, and it's seen through the eyes of our protagonist Chris played by Daniel Kaluuya.  He was also great in Black Mirror.  His representation of the black man in a white society gives everyone a glimpse into social cues and ticks black people are cognizant of and those white people never even think twice about.\n\nMost of the uncomfortableness comes from the pristine white family played by Bradley Whitford, Catherine Keener, and Allison Williams.  Peele pretty much spells it out for us that something is wrong but to the extent we really can't understand until those final scenes play out.  \n\nPeele's sketch-comedy background dealing with racism, social taboo, and other nuanced themes really helped make Get Out a joy to watch.  There's something to be said when a director (and first time at that) can take such a controversial and serious topic like racism and turn it into something we can laugh and joke about without getting all bent out of shape on 'political correctness'.  Get Out turned left when it should have turned right.",

I knew it would be disturbing but I didn't know just how brilliant it was based on many of the \"splat\" RT comments calling it \"stupid\", etc. It is shocking, surprising, funny, gory, disgusting, and yet satisfyingly intriguing. Steeped in the Stepfordesque theme it manages to combine the best elements of Hitchcockian suspense with an overlay of Rod Serling's sense of twisted macabre that shatters cultural and cinematic norms. On the surface, it is a well-made psychological thriller/horror flick, however its substrata pokes fun at and exposes a myriad of topics, from white privilege to racial stereotyping that challenge the very core of human decency, decadence and demoralizing injustice on so many emotional levels.

Overall its not the greatest movie for 2017, but it will be a cult classic, and a movie I think universities should dissect to understand the irony of culture in today's films. I might watch it again just to look into the messages I missed out the first time\n\nAlso never trust a woman who eats her cereal separately from her milk. That gave me chills for some reason",

The dull dialogue drags in between the rancid level of racially and social justice motivated quips that highlight the reverse racism of modern liberals while completely neglecting film basics like plots and character development. As with most duos, one usually outshines the other, and in Mr. Peele's case, we see his former comedy central counterpart has an extremely bright career ahead of him.\n\nThe way I would describe this movie in five words is: Lack of entertainment is overwhelming.",

            "content": "As self-explanatory as the title may seem, there is a lot more to this movie than it would suggest. The premise is the same as every horror movie that's ever been, but writer/director Jordan Peele has taken that old worn-out contrivance and spiked it with a social commentary that's about as on the mark of modern American culture as I've ever seen. I expected this to be another allegorical horror film, as that seems to be the trend in horror these days, but it's not allegorical at all... there is no metaphor for racism here, it's all out in the open. The movie explores the subtler, more common symptoms of racism... small things people say and do that seem harmless and maybe even complimentary, without even realizing the vast amount of stereotype and prejudice inherent in those statements/actions. This movie has its finger squarely on the pulse of white privilege, as well as minorities' justifiable wariness of it. It's probably the smartest \"horror\" film I've ever seen... though to call it 'horror' isn't quite right, it's more of a suspense thriller. There is no gore (the camera cuts away at the more grisly parts); the horror is more psychological in nature. The story goes from normal to creepy to freaky to scary, building on each in even progression. As the situation becomes more terrible and hopeless for the protagonist, it becomes all the more horrific when you realize that no matter how it ends, he is truly fucked. Even if he escapes and fights his way away from these crazy-ass white people, it's the word of a single black man against a slew of rich white people - and there is no way he is gonna come out on top. The power of the film is in that realization. I was a little disappointing with the end, which was not as dark as I expected it to be, and dare I say, should have been, given the message the film is conveying. But it has a humor to it as well (albeit a dark one), full of sly winks to the audience as it plays up all the things that black people stereotypically fear and makes them reality. This is the rare film that works both as a sharp social commentary as well as an effective suspense thriller. Mr. Peele certainly had something to say about the state of race relations today, and I don't know how he could have said it with more wit, bite, and clarity.",

The acting was wonderful from the lead cast who really helped add to the atmosphere and the tension. \n\nThe reason why I didn't give the film 5 stars was because of a couple issues I had. The party scenes were borderline absurd regarding the dialogue between Chris' character and the guests and to me just took something away from the overall feel...it perhaps could have been more subtle in execution. This, alongside the character of Jeremy, who I thought took more away with his characters abrasive nature and caused scenes he featured in to be overly focused towards his nature and dampened the creepiness which had progressed nicely. In fact whilst writing this I can still feel his overbearing presence over the course of the film.

En mi opini\u00f3n, el terror no solo son los Screamers, el buen terror te hace sentir incomodo, tenso y si es posible, miedo. El a\u00f1o pasado The Witch logr\u00f3 ser una de las mejores pel\u00edculas del a\u00f1o y una obra maestra del terror psicol\u00f3gico, jugando con el espectador con un lenguaje cinematogr\u00e1fico impecable, con una m\u00fasica precisa y una historia original con un giro de tuerca impresionante; precisamente esto mismo ocurre con \"Get Out\".\n\n\nEn \"Get Out\" o \"Huye\" no veremos brujas o demonios, en esta cinta el terror es provocado por un grupo de personas comunes y corrientes (Eso lo hace aun mas perturbador)\nLa historia es sobre una pareja interracial, ambos deciden pasar un fin de semana en la casa de los padres de la chica con el prop\u00f3sito de que los padres conozcan a la actual pareja de su hija. A pesar de ser una pel\u00edcula de suspenso (y de vez en cuando de comedia tambi\u00e9n) la historia toca temas como el racismo, cr\u00edtica la ignorancia que todav\u00eda existe en los americanos sobre este tema y de vez en cuando lanzan unas cuantas pedradas a Trump de la forma mas sutil posible. \n\n\nNo quiero hablar mas sobre la trama para no arruinarles la sorpresa, pero lo que si les puedo decir es que la pel\u00edcula logra generar tensi\u00f3n, a veces incomodidad, a veces repugnancia, y en ciertos momentos miedo. Desde que inicia hasta que termina, 104 minutos en donde vas a experimentar todo lo anteriormente mencionado. \nPuede que la historia llegue a ser un poco predecible en cierto momento de la pel\u00edcula, pero el giro de tuerca que nos presentan en el acto final es una locura total.",

The best thriller movies, in my opinion, derive their horror not from jump scares, musical cues, or gore but from the psychological impact of their premise, introducing ideas so affecting as to horrify and provoke thought and conversation far beyond viewing; Get Out is well acted, a perfect mix of humor and fright, and briskly paced, but it's that disturbing premise that puts it over the top as one of the best directorial debuts in recent memory.",

The tone of this film is not perfect. Its tones sometimes change. Even though I know this is serious yet funny, there are so many sequences that are difficult to distinguish between them. Or maybe, it's a combination of the two. The No, No, No scene and the running scene were one of them. Great performance, great directing, great writing, this is a pure horror film but funny. Then, it changed to serious matters. In retrospective, Get Out is an illustration of an uninvited guest at a party.",

I think it's more accurate to call this a suspense with some bizarre visuals and unnerving encounters, built on a kind of twisted sci-fi premise. In fact, the premise is rather laughable once you find out what the sicko white folks are up to.  Chris, the young black man who is the protagonist, seems pretty smart and yet his best friend is more of a stereotype jive talking goof.  Although not strictly about racism, the filmmaker does seem to advance a kind of sly racist notion from a black person's perspective--white people as predatory and deranged while on the surface seeming so civilized and intelligent.  I was also led to believe the film has a kind of quirky humor to it, but that's not really the case.  The scenes with Chris's friend going off in his manic fashion offer a sort of comic relief at times, but there's nothing else in the way of dark humor to the film.  In short, this is watchable and at times somewhat inventive, but overall it's more like a formula with little substance in its execution.  The protagonist survives with resourcefulness and will, but we're left with nothing more than a sense that white people are deeply disturbed and not to be trusted.",

He exposes behaviors that are usually covered up by just about everyone. This is particularly true in the post-Obama, pro-trump era. The genius of the film is how it keeps reinventing itself. It changes the way that film where people pay to do anything horrible they want to another person. That film starts out tame and beautiful, then slowly morphs into a shadowy place where a giant factory shoots out plumes of human ashes. Peele manages to achieve the same thing here, so when you see Allison's transformation at the end of the film, its shocking.

I have seen quite a few people pass this film off as race-baiting propaganda and I can confirm that this isn't the case. It uses racism as a storytelling element, but it in no way tries to antagonize one side nor victimize the other. It's less of a satire towards white people and more of a satire of stereotypical liberals that like to tell themselves that they're part of the fight against racism, but they actually come off as more racist that they let on. This film is a perfect allegory for that. Jordan Peele clearly has a love and an understanding of the horror genre and I can't wait to see what he brings to the table next.",

Examples of this would be the plantation-like atmosphere of the Armitage's residence, the Armitage's African-American \"housekeepers\", and the scene where Chris is being auctioned off to a group of rich, white folk.  Another issue that Peele examines is the current state of affairs between some African-Americans and Police Officers.  In the beginning of the film, we see Chris  being asked to provide identification without any real cause or reason, any obvious calling to the claims that Black people are racially profiled by Police office rs.  Another issue that is tested is the lack of media coverage that missing persons who are African-American get compared to, say, white females.  This is clear during the scene where Chris's friend, Rod, goes to the police about a mutual friend they both have (Andre Hayworth) who apparently went missing a few months ago and shows up at a party that the Armitage's are having, acting very different than they knew him before.  What is very interesting about this is that there appears to have been no investigation into a missing person's case by the police, as they just laugh at Rod's outlandish claims.  In conclusion, \"Get Out\" is an not only an excellent film that examines certain elements of Black culture, but also a Horror-Comedy film with a totally unique and fresh plot.

For instance, one person asks the main character \"Is the African-American experience an advantage or a disadvantage?\" A real racist wouldn't talk this way, as they would already have their mind made up. Although I'm sure that Jordan Peele had good intentions, it felt like the racial commentary was attempting to win over the non-racist audience while trying to persuade the racist audience not to be racist. However, it succeeds at the former but alienates the latter. Essentially, it succeeds on a level of entertaining the audience, but fails at pointing out any racial stereotypes or commenting on racial issues.

This movie kept me on my toes because it was filled with paranoia and suspense. This movie is about an interracial couple who go to visit her white liberal family. Chris, the African American boyfriend (Daniel Kaluuya) experiences really strange behavior from the other  African Americans he meets in Rose's(Alison Williams) hometown. Peele combines their weird behavior with real life scenarios and as a result the audience can relate to the movie. The movie \"Get Out\" communicates a very strong message about how racism is still with us today and that's why I personally like this movie.",

The gardener and maid are actually the white grandparents! Ok, so why are they treated so poorly? Do they want Chris to know they're racist? I thought the whole point was to keep that sh*t hidden?\nThey have to hypnotize people so they can \"sedate\" them to do the surgery! Ok so why doesn't the mother just work as a therapist in the city, gain clients' trust, then hypnotize them to come out to the house? Why add in all this uncomfortable stuff about interracial relationships being \"dangerous\" and \"you can't trust white b*tches lol\" when you could just have the mom hypnotizing people from the start? \n\nAs someone who is in an interracial relationship, I am well aware of the stigma still behind interracial couples a lot of the time, and while the start of the movie would lead you to believe it is going to show a good, positive view of an interracial couple, it quickly becomes apparent that this is just as prejudiced against people like me as the white people the movie protrays.\n\nAnd then there's this movie's weird love of the TSA. I'm sure there are some good people working in the TSA, don't get me wrong, but implying the TSA are basically like cops (the character in the TSA, Rod, even drives a cop car at the end inexplicably) is just confused and does not have nearly as much humor as they want it to.\n\nAnd then there was the uncomfortable fact that there was a Japanese man bidding on Chris' body with all the white people as if they were saying \"the Japanese are just as bad as white people!\" which plays into the whole model minority dynamic and ignores the fact that--shockingly--Asians face racism too!\n\nThe one good thing this movie had going for it was the acting, which was all fantastic!

Jordan Peele proves that his directing skills are something extraordinary, his screenplay is pure brilliance and his cast is unquestionably incredible, starting on the protagonist, Daniel Kaluuya, to LilRel Howery, the man behind the comedy bits in the film. A very important and thought-provoking movie with social preconceptions on other races explored to the tiniest detail, that only fails to deliver a precise backstory to Rose and it has some really minor issues with its second act's pacing and exposition scenes.\"",

At first, Chris reads the family's overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he never could have imagined.\" This film destroyed my expectations. Jordan Peele did an excellent job writing and directing a truely terrifying horror film. This film had everything perfect. The acting was excellent, the soundtrack was so well composed, the directing was excellent. An all round excellent film. Daniel Kaluuya was excellent in this film. He played the character so well. I see a bright acting career. Jordan Peele also has a bright career in writing and directing, this film is an excellent example of how amazing horror films can be without being cliche. The soundtrack was so chilling and fit the film. The runtime was perfect and the pace of the film was excellent. Overall, an amazing example of horror at its finest.

It's a black man coming home to a rich suburban white families house for the weekend, and despite their black servants, they're extremely nice to their daughters new boyfriend, too nice, something weird is going on. Yes, something weird is going on, only Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is too stupid to realize it! He's so deeply in love with his girlfriend of all of four months, that not only can't he see what's going on right in front of his face, but he doesn't try to talk to her about it, he doesn't try to investigate any of it, he just sort of goes with the flow. People are raving about this noir thriller, when it is one of the most poorly written films I've seen in a while. Major plot holes aside for the moment, there is absolutely no character development, no chemistry between the actors, and worst of all they don't even reveal the main plot until twenty minutes before the thing is over! Yes, it's weird, yes, something is going on, but the writers don't even hint at what that is! They don't even give us a chance to figure out what it could possibly be. At first it was interesting and I was hoping there would be clues to help us figure out what might be going on, that maybe Chris would find evidence or over hear something, but no such luck. Maybe there could have been a scene without him, that gave us some insight, there was absolutely nothing until the very end, when it was all thrust into our faces and even then it really didn't make a whole lot of sense. Without giving anything away, they never answer the fundamental question, why black people? I never liked traditional noir, but at least most of the time the acting is good and you have some idea of what's going on. This film is just one big circle of confusion and to be honest with you, aside from some terrific comic relief, I hated every minute of it.",

All the key factors for the resolution happen way too conveniently and are crammed in a pace-breaking, rapid Act III. \n\nThe comedy relief moments--even though unfitting for the theme and tone of the film--are actually the most memorable scenes.

It actually sort of leads you to believe the plot will be simple and predicable. Its got to be about white privilege or talking down to white audiences. You've probably read a few articles about how it flips the race thing on its head, not simply being about ignorant racist southerners, whose brand we've seen all too often. That it does do. Also, if you have been listening to comparisons, Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, Stepford Wive's and Rosemary's Baby are certainly influences on Jordan Peele. Like Quintin Tarantino he borrows, never bites, from those inspirations. Its from half of Key & Peele, so It's funny, witty and then surprisingly scary. Apparently JP has 9 more horror films like this in his bandolier\n\nChildish Gambino's song Redbone plays over the introduction, perfectly fitting the tone of the movie as it demands people \"Stay Woke!\". Allison Williams is one of my favorite characters as Rose, but the two male leads also help make the film all that it is. Daniel Kaluuya is believable in an accent that's not even close to his and Lil Rel Howery plays the everyman perfectly. In this day and age it seems like an operation such as the one going on in this Connecticut town wouldn't get far, especially if you have constant connection to someone outside like Howery. The casting of the family is also brilliant, each filling their role well as supporting characters. The townsfolk are also creepy, especially Atlanta's Keith Stanfield. This is a movie that seems like it never would have got made (like Wonder Woman), but it did and the world is all the better for it. He does well balancing the tone of the film throughout. Peele crafts a horror movie that feels fresh and new; a feat most horror movies only dream of.\n\n\nIn the beginning the film is pace is slow, a perfect set up for whats to come. By the end though it is thrilling, as all that build up comes to a worthy pay off. It's uncomfortable to notice all attempts by the main character to bond over black culture with the other African Americans in the town are failing. The only one who seems to not be acting odd is Rose and maybe with her help, he can get out of this weirdo situation. Visually it is fine and nothing is queer to the eye, but the story and delivery of an on point 'social thriller' is the main accomplishment of the film. This being the directors first outing no one could have saw this coming, and it makes the score a few steps higher because of what he managed to pull off.",

Most of the scares/violence are in the third act, really. The film's about Chris Washington, a black man, who visits Rose Armitage's (his girlfriend)'s house to meet her parents. There, he learns the terrible truth behind what the Armitage family. (I won't reveal anything beyond that as it could be considered as spoilers) The script is pretty damn good. Not a single cheesy line. Most of the comic relief comes from Washington's friend, Rod Williams, a police officer who tries to help in his situation. This is a thriller worthy of the critical and commercial acclaim it received. Go see it if you liked movies like '10 Cloverfield Lane'!",

There was this sense of uneasiness throughout the entire picture that was done so very well. I always love Allison Williams in everything she does and she was stunning here. I don't remember ever seeing Daniel Kaluuya in anything before but after watching him as the lead here, he will be a star.

I'd like to point out that everybody talks about this movie and how well it deals with racism towards blacks, what about racism towards whites? Yes it is actually possible to be racist to a white person everyone, and this movie can be quite a lot. Anyway, moving on: Get Out is a film about a guy going to meet his girlfriends parents for the first time, which he is unsure about doing as they don't know he is black. He is hesitant at first but finally agrees to it and they head to her parents farm-house. At first everything seems fine, but then our main character Chris (Played by Daniel Kaluuya), starts to notice things. After an awkward dinner the night before with his girlfriend Rose's (Played by Allison Williams) brother talking about how black people are so much stronger and could take anyone on in a fight, they decide to leave the next day. This doesn't happen as it turns out they have a dinner party planned. Things start to get really weird, such as Rose's mom putting Chris in hypnosis, shady shit going on, and a weird encounter with another person, things start to go awry very fast. I will admit with what I said about the racism thing, their are probably people out there who are like this. Get Out can be a fairly freaky, jump-scare cliche at times, but at other times it fails to impress. While having great acting, this movies plot didn't rope me in like the trailer did, and slowly just went downhill in my opinion. Albeit an awesome and satisfying ending, the movies lackluster storytelling is what lost it for me. I will admit, this movie does have a very interesting and well-crafted plot twist, so I enjoyed that, and a lot of humor also made this movie much more tolerable for me personally. To me, a mediocre movie with talented actors but lackluster plot. Not bad just not great, and for me it doesn't have re-watch-ability.",

The movie starts out somewhat slow(a good thing in my opinion) and progressively gets faster and faster and weirder and weirder at a perfect pace like a very well made roller coaster ride. The only thing I think this kind of movie could have benefited from was a darker ending but that's not to say the actual ending is bad I just feel it could have possibly worked better.

            "content": "Jordan Peele's screenwriting/directorial debut is quite the leap, exchanging the comedic chops one might expect for a potent blend of social commentary, suspense and horror. Peele shows us a creepy upper-class suburban atmosphere, host to a mixed-race couple's \"meet the parents\" moment, with a thick, permeating air of uncertainty and alarm. Everyone seems overly accepting of Chris, hometown girl Rose's new black boyfriend, but there's a look to their gaze that might imply something else. The town's dark-skinned residents, however, are less reserved. They behave like marionettes, Stepford Wives with an unnervingly wide smile: stiff, oddly-dressed and thoroughly disconcerting in posture and prose. At first glance, I worried that the metaphors Peele was searching for would be too on-the-nose and blunt, but his well paced, muti-layered story soon brushes those concerns away. The analogies remain, but they're nuanced and subtle, effective players in a larger tapestry. The greater story is twisting and unpredictable, a mystery that efficiently mixes legitimate worries with tension-breaking laughs and personal connections to throw us off the scent. We don't know who's in on the scheme (or what that scheme might be) until the very end, and for too long Chris is afraid to point fingers, lest he offend. Balancing social niceties with the increasing terror makes a great vehicle for this genre, and the prim-and-proper atmosphere only makes the occasional weird offhand remark or personal tick stick out that much more. An excellent small-scale nail-biter, it's richly crafted and sharp, with a sensitive finger right on the cultural pulse. Well worth the hype.",

Also as a delightful surprise the movie satirizes racist themes latent in liberalism. Thus the movie was deeply thought provoking. The only problems I had were minor, such as the race theme seemed overly superficial to me at times and some of the medical science elements of the plot were technically absurd, such that I had to suspend my beliefs to remain wrapped up in the plot. I should not fail to mention that the acting was superb, and Allison Williams was a standout. If you like a multi-dimensional film that excels in horror, mystery, suspense, while at the same time stimulating your mind with thoughts and perspective about race relations, then I highly recommend this film. I expect I will watch it a few more times for pure enjoyment and to explore further the race themes this movie puts forth.",

It's that sort of movie.  In a lot of ways, I think it's sort of the Stepford Wives of its time.  Without getting into spoilers, I will say it's not identical in terms of plot and twists, but there are some similarities.  But the biggest Stepford connection is the fact that it's social commentary on an issue of the time through a horror movie.  A daytime horror movie at that, at least for the most part.  There are nighttime scenes for sure, but a lot of the thrills take place in broad daylight in decidedly nonthreatening environments that are given a threatening edge.  This not only works as an intriguing approach to horror, it's also part of the movies themes and the conversation it's trying to create.  It's a very uneasy sort of movie, and hypnotic in it's thrills.  I watched it with a friend, and while at first we were sort of talking to each other while it was on, there reached a point when we literally stopped mid-sentence because the movie had grabbed us.\nObjectively speaking, there's not much I can really find at fault with this movie.  From a technical and performance perspective, it's insanely well-made.  From a story perspective, it's good, though I do have a couple little nitpicks that seem like holes but work to get its point across.  My only real issue is that there's never really a point in the movie where you don't think somethings wrong, where you think maybe these people are okay.  From the get go, you know there's something up with this family, so despite their niceties you're just waiting for them to reveal the sinister side.  Once they do, you're waiting for the reveal of why their doing this.  When each of these turns happen, it just doesn't have quite the punch I would have liked.  I was drawn in to the films world, but it never really hit me, I was sort of just watching it happen.  Maybe that's just me, but I never felt the real impact of what was happening.  Having said that, the stuff that happens was still interesting to me, and I was curious where it was going to go.\nThis feels so close to being a modern horror/social commentary masterpiece, but it lacked a certain punch for me to really call it that.  As it stands though, it's still a damn good genre film with a lot of great performances from actors I really haven't seen in much and an astonishingly good directorial debut for Jordan Peele.  Maybe that opinion will change after a few more viewings.  Right now though, that's where I'm at.",

In this over the top movie, that's exactly what these people do.  Ironic that the same Hollywood that harbors these white liberal racists is the same institution that now puts out a movie on the very subject, attempting to keep the white racial guilt alive.  Possibly Peeles attempt at some soul searching?  Anyways an entertaining movie for the rest of us normal Americans who couldn't have cared about race back in the 80s.

Confronting and dealing with it is necessary. Rather than take a look in the mirror many get irrationally defensive.

Even the twist ending, which I heard such great things about, could be seen from a mile away by any other horror fan. \n\nWhat this film does achieve, however is a terrific blend of horror and comedy, and a genuine feeling of suspense throughout its runtime. The performances are terrific across the board, except for Caleb Landry Jones' terribly annoying Johnny Depp-wannabe performance. Lil Rel Howery's comedic performance stole the show for me. He is the funniest young comedian no one is talking about, and hopefully this film brings him to the mainstream.",

Instead of being scared I was full of tension... it started slow, then quickly ramped up as the plot went on.  To the point where I was holding my breath during some scenes (like when he went through her box of pictures).  I was hooked even though I knew how it ended.  It's been a year since I saw it originally so I had forgotten.  Anyway I thoroughly enjoyed it and upped my rating to 3.5*.  I would recommend this to every horror fan but just know going in that this likely won't scare you... that's not the point with this movie.\n\nOriginal Review:\nWaaaay over-rated.

            "content": "WHAT I LIKED: On the one hand, 'Get Out' is undoubtedly a very gripping and engaging thriller indeed, but really it's more so a product of a whole host of different ingredients.\nYes Jordan Peele certainly isn't going for a straight genre piece here, as the story he writes is one of relative insanity that goes an awfully long way to literally explore its racial themes. Of course that approach to ideas could have easily come off as ridiculous and forced (as it has in many other movies such as 'The Age of Adeline') but it is surprisingly successful here because it doesn't take itself too seriously, and because it hooks you enough to stop you thinking about things too much.\n\nYes for one, Get Out is most definitely a film that invests and engages you extremely effectively as Peele not only builds a well-layered (and well-portrayed) lead character, but he also places him in plenty of genuinely tense and uncomfortable moments that are upped throughout and brought to life by the brilliant score and cinematography.\n\nSecondly though, one can also say that none of that would have worked if it had dealt everything with a straight face and a steady hand, as the madness of the whole thing would have still felt unnatural. As such, Get Out delivers its crazy - if thematically grounded - story in a very humble and amusing manor that feels as though it doesn't take itself too seriously. In a way this is once again brought to life by the lead character, who travels through it all with a somewhat nervous brow and yet a calm and amused attitude that comes off exactly how one is supposed to perceive the whole experience as a viewer.\n\nMatch all that with some potentially eye-opening themes and what you get is a film that successfully challenges the expectations of the genre, its audience and its storytelling methods by using a pinch-of-salt approach with its underlying insanity to ensure it all feels organic and exciting. In the end it's a very enjoyable, engaging and amusing thriller, and whilst that may sound like an overly mixed bag, I can definitely say that none of those elements would have worked as well without each other.\n\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: As it truly descends into madness in the final act, it does occasionally feel as though its forgotten how silly it has become.\n\nVERDICT: A film that embraces its unique-ness in a way that engages and amuses; 'Get Out' is a surprising success from Jordan Peele that should hopefully get him more directorial work in the future.",

            "content": "Fairly entertaining black comedy masquerading as a horror film which, unfortunately, keeps itself back by engaging in a completely ridiculous story. But taken with an extremely large pinch of salt, it remains enjoyable if quite predictable. It's best watched not knowing anything other than the basic story - young inter-racial couple visit her well to do parents, but not is all quite as things seem. That's all you should be armed with before watching.\n\nWhile a decent horror-comedy (and I use \"horror\" very loosely and \"comedy\" for that matter), it's still somewhat astonishing that it currently holds a 99% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes? It really isn't that good.\n\nIt probably makes for \"better\" viewing in a racially charged and hysterical country like the US. But, outside of that nation, it looks sort of twee. I say \"hysterical\", because there is a specific type of touchstone in the US regarding race and for obvious reasons. But that touchstone doesn't travel well and outside of that, 'Get Out' doesn't really have anything else to say. The story is utterly absurd and by itself in another film, would be rightly ripped apart. But, the film isn't really about its story. Getting into some mild spoilerific territory, 'Get Out' has some razor sharp satire regarding Liberal White America - which has strangely been misappropriated by outraged Conservatives in some quarters - and it contains some nice subtle comments (the black protagonist picks cotton at one point). But, while its wit is present, little else is to tell the truth. However, it's just enough to carry the film over the line, as it were.\n\nWell done, but certainly not half as smart as some people think it is and it's scuppered with a couple of dodgy characters here and there. After the incredible reception it has received and abundant online hype, you may come away feeling a bit short changed.",

But reaches amazing fronts on political beliefs as well, targeting a perfect kind of racist person who doesn't realize who they are. The first half is my personal favorite as it doesn't succumb to the usual horror movie tropes that the second half does. Not that the second half is bad by any means it's still amazing it's just not as fantastic as the beginning. In the beginning it has most of it's political discussion and features the main character going to his white girlfriends family home for one weekend. When he arrives everything seems normal but more and more the movie unfolds and shows the family's deep down thoughts. There's a clearly fast pacing after SPOILERS Catherine Keener \nputs playing Missy puts Daniel Kaluuya playing Chris Washington into a different state of mind called the sunken place. After this the movie isn't the same.",

The argument that it is a reflection of social divide in contemporary America, summarised neatly within a horror film, is just bullocks. The film has such glaring plot holes any social commentary is a farce.\n\nFor example, consider the following (to but name a few):\n- I love the fact that the entire film has this racial undertone. But yet the mastermind (the Grandfather - an old white man) willing chooses to become a man of colour. And then relegates himself as a servant to his own family. \n- Let us not forget they do that to the Grandmother as well. Talk about karma.\n - I am also pretty sure all these people disappearing to the same girlfriend, may have raised just a little bit more suspicion. \n\nCome on. It was a fun watch. But seriously. Lord of the Rings is more plausible. And while I understand we are expected to suspend belief when we go watch a film, let's just be reasonable.",

Jordan Peele is on fire here as writer and director, you'd never guess that it's his film debut. The pacing here is perfect as the tone cycles through the tension that builds throughout the film and the necessary moments of humor that momentarily break that tension. The script is also amazing tight with hints to what's really going on peppered throughout, I might have even guessed the truth if I had been prepared for the film to go as completely insane and dark as it does.\n\nDaniel Kaluuya plays the lead and does a brilliant job playing this guy who thinks he's in your standard awkward and uncomfortable situation, only to discover that he's actually in a dangerous situation. The entire creepy white family is also brilliantly acted, Bradley Whitford and Allison Williams being the standouts. And there was one scene in which Betty Gabriel completely steals the movie for a few minutes, I hope she gets cast in more stuff.\n\nOverall this is a must see, and hopefully an eye opener for people that don't realize how casually racist they are in their day to day lives. 9.5/10",

With that said, even though it's not one of my favorites this year, I thought this a really well done movie.  I appreciated the camera shots, score/soundtrack, acting, and script.  Peele does a really good job of balancing the horror/suspense and the comedy while avoiding the tropes of stupid characters and low-brow humor.  I think framing the film's commentaries on racial issues around the horror story made the metaphor for the life as an African American man more relatable without being overbearing.  Overall, it's not the funniest or scariest film out there, but it's sharp and entertaining enough to deserve it's 99% RT score.",

The family is strange from the beginning, and really you wonder what direction the movie is going to go in. You wonder what's up with these strange people. The\n performances from all actors involved is really what makes this film stand out. Every single actor and actress buy in with an intensity and realism that captivates the viewer.\n\nThe film does have comic relief which helped the film in certain areas.\n\nI will say the first half of the film was great.  It kept you guessing, it had me intrigued, it made me wonder about this family and other things.  Was the girlfriend in on it? I had questions.\nThe last 20 minutes kept this film from being a complete 4 star film.\nIt fell into some of the cliches that plague other horror films.  Also the film revealed itself a little early into what was going on.  I will add that from the social satire aspect of the film, I felt it went a little too deep, even if some would say it was necessary.\nAll that being said the performances were so electric, and the twisted nature of the film really make this a unique must see flick.",

He's a bit uneasy about how they'll treat him, as they're white and he's black.  However, her parents turn out to be unfazed and everything seems to be going fine.  Chris then starts to notice some weird behavioral traits with the black staff at the house.  The Armitages then throw a huge party and Chris ends up in some awkward conversations with the guests.  He initially just puts it down to the racial difference, but then the guests', and Armitages', motives start to appear more sinister. Chris decides it is time to get out...\n\nGreat directorial debut from Jordan Peele, who also wrote the script.  Peele was one half of the hilarious comedy duo Key and Peele, so you would be excused for thinking that his first movie would be a comedy.  Get Out is not a comedy.  It starts as a social commentary and ends as a horror-thriller.  \n\nIn both respects it is great, though I preferred the social drama aspect more.  Some very clever observations regarding race relations in the first half of the movie, and I imagine a fairly accurate depiction of the African-American experience.  As a horror-thriller the build up and plot development is very good but the ending felt a bit too easy and rushed.  The conclusion is also not very profound, which is a bit disappointing after all the social observations that came before. \n\nThis said, the ending would be the only weak spot, and it only appears weak because the rest of the movie was so good.  \n\nPeele does throw in some comedy moments, via the character of Rod Williams, and these are great.\n\nSolid performances all round.  Daniel Kaluuya, as Chris, is probably the best of lot.  LilRel Howery, as Rod Williams, almost steals the show though.\n\nGreat movie.",

This is crazy. So I went to see it and... it is pretty good. Good for comedy, but horror?\n\nLet me get it straight first: I think it is a very good movie! It is smart, well-shot and original. I think it tangled a very taboo subject and successfully. It asked the question: are really comfortable with racial differences. Unlike 90% of the movies today that treated way too seriously than it is, it poked fun of it by showing some of the social awkwardness. They would keep on saying things like \"black is the new white\" and \"I would vote for Obama a third time\" but on the other hand gave the main character with a strange eye. Admitted we all have it once in a while when we first meet diversity. It poked fun of people's political correctness yet ignorance on the inside. I find it funny and refreshing. However, the problem is this kept on repeating and feel very unrealistic. I felt like I was watching an M Night Shyamalan. Speaking of which, at times I even wondered if the film directed by him because there were so many similarities to his styles, such as the awkward dialogues, constant and random close ups and most importantly, very out of nowhere twist which I won't spoil.\n\nI did like the cinematography. I liked the set. The house looked like familiar yet unique. It looks like somewhere your neighbor lives but to me it also felt like one of those southern cotton farm in the old times. It gave me a sense of uncomfartability but it doesn't creep me out, which I would expect from an horror film. I think the problem is that everything is way too well polished. By that I meant that every things looked way too clean and it felt the budget was way bigger than it was (5 mil). Split on the other hand, had a slightly bigger budget but it had a more indie look, which helped to raise the suspense and dread. One thing I did like is the sunken place. I won't spoil it, because it is hard to describe anyways, but just watch.....\n\nThe big problem is that the comedy went too far, especially from the actor Lil Rel Howery. He is very good and very likable, but his section is so over-the-top that it clashes with the tone of the movie. Long story short, I liked it as a social commentary rather than a thriller or horror film. I felt the advertising is very misleading. There were many plot holes, which again, I don't want to spoil.

But the film isn't half as intelligent nor as unpredictable as it thinks it is.\nWriter-Director Jordan Peele's approach is fresh and ferocious, but it isn't forward-thinking. In short, the film falls apart long before the third act, due to predictable plot developments followed by Mr Peele's complete failure to realise that his high-concept premise has no need for sci-fi MacGuffins. \nThe film is at its best during its early moments of Twilight Zone obscurity. The majority of which are skin-crawlingly creepy thanks to some fantastic secondary performances.\nThe film is at its worst, however, when it tries to paper its self-torn cracks with mad scientist mumbo jumbo. One development in particular is left not only hanging in thin air, but also distracting from the oblique aura of psycho-racial tension Mr Peele had previously worked so hard to build.",

            "content": "Get Out may not be a masterpiece, as some people claim it is, but you'd be hard pressed to find a movie that's so exciting and fun while simultaneously communicating a problem in modern society. In short, it is without a doubt one of the best films to come out so far this year, especially when compared to its terrible January/February competition, but it is far from a perfect film.  \n\nThe strongest element of the film is the creative and innovative script, by a relatively large margin. Peele demonstrates his trademark creativity with the extremely clever and somewhat subtle signs which are used to gradually build the tension, while simultaneously delivering useful exposition. In doing this, Peele ensures that the movie does not overstay its welcome, while still telling a complete, satisfying, and intriguing story. Two other major strengths that Get Out has are the masterful acting and extraordinary pacing. Lead actor Daniel Kaluuya delivers an incredibly authentic performance as the protagonist, Chris. Kaluuya manages to deliver a mind blowing performance filled with authenticity, from his convincing line delivery to his eerily realistic body languages. Rose (Allison Williams), Rod (LiRel Howlery), and the rest of the supporting cast all deliver extremely solid performances to complement Kaluuya, though none quite compare to his brilliant performance. Peele does a truly wonderful job of pacing the film, as he is able to keep the film suspenseful and interesting for the first act, increase the intensity in the second act, and finish strong with an impactful ending that audiences will not soon forget. At no point does the film feel rushed or does it drag on, it is as close to a perfect balance as one can get. \n\nThis movie only had a couple of major shortcomings, though they ultimately did not do much to hinder my enjoyment of the film. A few times throughout the film, there are manufactured jump-scares, or jump-scares that would not occur in the movie's universe. For example, in one scene, a character is faintly seen lurking in the background, and when the character reveals herself, Peele inserts a slam, which is  cheap and lazy way to scare the audience. Also the plot is stretched a bit thin for this 1 hour and 44 minute film. At no point does it drag, but there is only so much you can do with a plot like this. \n\nGet Out is one of the most dynamic films of 2017 thus far, working very well on nearly every level, all the while seamlessly working in valuable social commentary without it seeming forced or ham-fisted. Jordan Peele certainly exceeds all expectations in his directorial debut, so if you want to see the best horror/comedy/thrillers in months, definitely check this one out.",

But where this movie excels is in Peele's ability to take his story and force and personal discussion about the social issues he is critiquing through his characters. \n\nMore than just its social commentary, this movie is so excellently written and can provide many major studios with the kind of detail oriented outlines for the scripts they so desperately need. Especially for the horror genre. \n\nWatch it. Own it. An excellent modern horror film.",

To anybody that says this is an original film I employ you go out watch two films Stepford Wives and Skeleton Key because once you watch those two you will understand that's all this film is just a new version of an old idea but with one major difference full stop that difference of course in Stratford wives and Skeleton Key there was slightly more flushed out with the plot than this won't you watch it and you give it real thought you realise Swiss cheese has less holes in it on this thing I could never recommend this to anyone I know and to anyone who found it even slightly amusing I worry for you",

This scathing satire is the perfect horror film for the post-Obama era, taking a razor-sharp scalpel to white liberal attitudes on race. Peele succeeds where sometimes even more experienced filmmakers fail: He's made an agile entertainment whose social and cultural observations are woven so tightly into the fabric that you're laughing even as you're thinking, and vice-versa. What makes Get Out more than just a slam-bang scarefest is that, in its own darkly satiric way, it is also a movie about racial paranoia that captures the zeitgeist in ways that many more \"prestigious\" movies don't. I think studios need to take more chances on films like this. Films that try to be different and push boundaries. Get Out is bold and daring and most importantly, unique. A marvel of tightly controlled pacing, off-kilter visuals, and rich atmosphere, Peele's film owes a good deal of its exquisite shocks to the claustrophobic terrors of Rosemary's Baby and the manicured dread of Bryan Forbes's The Stepford Wives. Funny, scary, and thought-provoking, Get Out seamlessly weaves its trenchant social critiques into a brilliantly effective and entertaining horror/comedy thrill ride.\n\nVERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",

The set-up, a middle class black man entering an upper class home where the only other black faces are the servants, is the perfect fodder for a paranoid horror mystery and it\u0092s handled expertly for a first time helmer.  But it ends up somewhere far more generic than you\u0092d expect, and it never quite decides if the allegories you think its setting up are a double bluff.  The politics of the first half are intriguing for such a mainstream film, minutely dissecting the way casual racism can come from the most unexpected sources, but this does mean that some of the characterisation doesn\u0092t stand up to scrutiny when the film starts dropping surprised later on.

All of the actors played their parts extremely well, although it was not as apparent the first time around as it was the second time watching it, which I HIGHLY recommend everyone do.

This movie is scarier than all of them, and earns its scares. \n\t It stars Daniel Kaluuya as Chris, a young black man who is going up to visit his white girlfriend's family. His girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams), and her parents are white, middle-class, liberals, who \"would have voted for Obama a third time\" if they could. Even so, Chris picks up what he perceives to be the subtle racism present in even these families. Of course, this being a horror film, it turns out to be something much more sinister. \n\tThis movie is branded as a \"horror-comedy,\" which I would disagree with. Sure, there's some comic relief, mostly thanks to one character, but this is a horror film, and even more so a mystery. And when the mystery is finally revealed towards the end, it makes everything that happened before it all the more creepy. After this revelation occurs is when the movie becomes a classical horror film, and the final act is done smartly and very entertainingly. \n\tThe way this movie tackles racism is also very smart. Unlike last year's overblown Zootopia, this film deals with serious political issues without forgetting to make a movie. Subtle racism is the theme here; not the blatant racism found in the KKK or the alt-right, but in everyday, middle-class, even liberal folks who try so hard to accept African-Americans that they end up simply making them more uncomfortable. It takes the concept of subtle racism and builds a fantasy out of it; a sort of \"what if\" question kind of film that takes a real element in our society and imagines a creative backstory behind it. This film isn't as politically charged as you might think, though; there is smart social commentary, but not so much that it becomes an ideological preach. There's a really good, scary story here that compliments its message rather than exclusively becoming it. \n\tThe end of the film is fun, entertaining, and thrilling, like any good horror movie ending should be - think Halloween and The Shining. It's not, as the trailers seem to be trying to make us think, a weird, random, nonsensical ghost story. It's neither supernatural nor a slasher; Peele comes up with a unique horror concept that lends itself to one of the best horror movies in recent years. It's not gloomy, depressing, or demeaning; even in its darkest moments, there's fun, excitement, thrills, and, in the most classical sense of the word, horror.\n\n--\nRating: 4/4",

The efforts of Key and Peele on Comedy Central are what I consider to be the edgiest, most important comedy work dealing with social issues that I have seen right alongside with Amy Schumer's fearless feminist takes on her own series at that network.\nSo, I got brave and took a friend to see it with me during the daylight! A matinee! \"Yes! We can watch it safely\" I thought.\nIt was fabulous! We were screaming at the screen, \"Get! Out! Now!\"\nThe lead actor, Daniel Kaluuya, was in another scary piece I'd seen in a British Sci Fi series called, Black Mirror - a segment titled 'Fifteen Million Merits'. He's great to watch and his arc in Get Out is wonderful.\nI don't want to spoil a thing and recommend seeing it without watching or listening or reading ANYTHING beforehand.\nJust.

            "content": "WOW, i mean, i don't even know where to start...... This movie came completely out of nowhere, who knew that Jordan Peele's directorial debut would be this fucking good. 'Get Out' is a Horror/Comedy about Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) who goes on a trip to visit his girlfriend Rose's (Allison Williams) parents whose odd behaviour towards this interracial couple gets increasingly more concerning for Chris during their stay. Ever since reading the initial synopsis for this film i was completely IN just based on that alone, it sounded very intriguing and more importantly it was inherently original, the type of film more people need to go and see. And this movie completely delivered and surpassed my expectations on almost all fronts. This movie highlights a perfect application of Horror, with plenty of unsettling imagery, and Peele blends it perfectly with hints of comedy that hit EVERY time and did not feel out of place at all. The performances here are also so riveting and only enhance the very unsettling nature of this film. \n\nI will start with commending Jordan Peele on his success with this film, not only was this a venture away from the comedic material he is known for as one half of 'Key and Peele' but this was also his directorial debut which is insane. Isn't it funny how this comedic actor can take a leap of faith into Horror for his directorial debut and accomplish something greater than most modern horror directors. What makes this film so well crafted is the way he expertly blends themes of horror with comedy and also incorporates subtle social commentary here and there that you can notice yet doesn't take you out of the film. I mean there are scenes in this film that are terrifying and unsettling but are also really fucking funny. He manages to terrify you right in the middle of some quite humorous scenes and it blends perfectly in ways i can't possible explain to you through words. And forget creepy imagery, there are some scenes where there is nothing even slightly scary on the screen and just through the use of very confronting camera placement you feel so uneasy you just want to squirm in your seat. \n\nOne incredible thing to note with this film is that typically you see in horror films sequences of building suspense towards multiple big terrifying scary moments scattered throughout. But what is really cool here is that the suspense is being built up constantly throughout the entire film towards a final 20 minutes or so that is so balls to the fucking wall crazy that your mind will be blown. The film grabs you early on and for an hour and 40 minutes it is slowly tightening its grip keeping you locked in your seat and delivering with one of the best climaxes in a horror film that i've ever seen. It goes to places you never even imagined it would go and it turns what is a fantastic premise into an incredible story. The pacing is crucial to the suspense factor and the way it gets progressively faster as the film goes on works so damn well. It gives the film plenty of time early on to introduce characters, get you to care about them, and implement little hints here and there of things to come. And it also allows the film to close out on a high note where it does not mess around.\n\nAnd i mentioned the performances briefly but you cannot look past them when thinking about this movie. Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams were phenomenal as this couple and i was completely sucked into every one of their scenes and believed all of their exchanges because they were all so goddamn natural. The film focuses on Daniel's character predominantly so that is the character we are experiencing the film through and he does a great job at really letting you connect and relate with him. The parents though, OMG they were fucking great. Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener were intriguing, unsettling, and haunting, a lot of the time without even saying a word. And also this guy deserves a mention also; LilRel Howery plays Chris' friend Rod Williams in the film and he is fucking hilarious. He provides the majority of the larger comedic moments and his timing was on point 100% of the time. Having a straight up purely comedic character in this film that offers a perfect blend of Horror and Comedy could have been very out of place but it worked so damn well. \n\nSo in the end, yeh, there really wasn't anything i did not like about this movie, the story was great and hooked me in right from the get-go, the characters and performances were all so well introduced and developed. The way Jordan Peele blended Horror and Comedy so seamlessly was incredible especially for his directorial debut. Now the only question looming is was it a fluke or can he deliver this sort of quality again and again and transition into a continuously successful director? Only time can tell. If you haven't gathered this already then YES you should most definitely see this movie, it doesn't release in Australia until May the 4th (Be With You) so until then just wait in anticipation. \n\n9.1/10",

I did like the acting, the overall premise and the revealing twist (or should I say \"twists\"), but something about the whole execution still felt somewhat awry, not as connected or plausible as I would have liked. Like many other such movies, and the 2015 movie The Invitation comes to mind, something about what's going on simply didn't feel plausible or believable enough. It wasn't completely bad as a social satire or an attempt to expose the still existing racism or what have you, but as a movie that is supposed to convince and be believable something still was amiss.",

This story has a twist which makes you want to go and rewatch the movie again so you can pick up the small plot details that are hidden in the movie that you will only understand when the twist is revealed. LilRel Howery as officer Rod is one of the best things about this movie. His scenes will make you laugh even if you have a dead soul. This movie easily get's a 10/10. Go and watch this movie, you will have a great time!",

I repeat, JORDAN PEELE, a guy who's done almost nothing but comedic work. Granted, he's a great comedic talent, but this movie shows that he might actually be a force to recon with!\n\nThe film itself worked really well in terms of structure, cinematography and acting. It follows some horror tropes from the past, but it utilizes a more unique premise and a gradual reveal of its twists and beautiful shots to keep things engaging. In all honesty though, I found the film to be more unsettling than scary. It is definitely the good kind of unsettling however. On top of that, it provokes some interesting thoughts about racism which I won't spoil for you here. I probably wouldn't say it's a game changer in the horror genre, especially since there are a few moments that end up leaving me questioning things rather than trying to put the pieces together, but in just the way it's executed, it certainly is well-made.\n\nIt's definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a worthwhile recent Hollywood film, as it has a very good chance of being one of the best films of this year!\n\n4.5 stars out of 5!",

Based on the trailers and director Jordan Peele's sketch comedy pedigree, I expected a subversive and satirical take on suburban racism, kind of like if Cabin in the Woods was more interested in the world around it than horror tropes (the presence of Bradley Whitford certainly didn't hurt that expectation). Suffice to say, Get Out is not the film I prejudged it to be. It's insights into white-collar racism are sharp, but I expected that. It has its moments of deadpan hilarity, but I expected that. What I didn't expect is how terrifying and tense the film is, and how visually distinctive and original Peele's production is. This is not only a movie that deftly highlights a rift in the modern discussion about race, but it is also 2017's answer to It Follows and The Witch as an original vision in horror, and an announcement of Jordan Peele as a filmmaker well worth following.",

            "content": "From the mind of Jordan Peele comes one of the more surprising thrillers in recent memory: Get Out. There is a crazy amount of hype around this film and normally that can kill everything, but this is actually a film that earns every bit of it. While there is one slight issue here, Get Out is a rare film that walks the line between satire and social awareness and delivers a great time at the movies.\n\nThere is a lot in this film that works but what is definitely the most prominent feature of this film is Jordan Peele's eye in the director's chair. This is such an ornate film that it almost seems like an independent arthouse project. More importantly, Peele even throws in minuscule details that hint towards the future twists in the plot. The color pallet, the use of certain camera shots, all the way down to small visual details, Peele has crafted a film in the way that Stanley Kubrick himself would have been pleased to see. \n\nThe script by Jordan Peele is no slouch and does arguably more work here than the rest of the crew involved. The story is simple with a interracial couple taking a weekend for a white girl to introduce her black boyfriend to her family. However things get awkward and from there we are thrust into a thriller with twists and turns that will do more than keep you engaged. The beauty of the script is that there is comedy in parts as well as heavy drama with horror like elements, but yet it does address these social issues that don't often get brought up. Not once did I feel like the issues took precedent over the story but rather uses them to back up the thriller aspect of the film. Anytime a film can accomplish that in a way that you might not even notice it, there is something special about it.\n\nThere is one major issue with the script though and that is that there is a bit of predictability about it. You can definitely see where the script is going in parts and this does get kind of obvious. While the events of the film are orchestrated in a great way and the overall end product does make this a small problem, you may sit there and think that you have seen this before.\n\nThe cast is fantastic and really do sell this film where it counts. A newer face in Hollywood named Daniel Kaluuya stars as Chris, the boyfriend, and he is hands down the best part of this film. Empathetic, funny, and more importantly shows astounding range; Kaluuya is definitely has a future thanks to this film. Allison Williams stars as the girlfriend, Rose, and does a great job. She is super effective in the role and plays her part like a champ. We also get some great roles from more familiar actors like Stephen Root, Catherine Keener, and Bradley Whitford. They all are great and are huge parts in really filling out the world of this film. However someone who actually almost steals the film is  Lil Rel Howery as Chris's best friend. He adds comedic relief in the best places and definitely makes this film feel like a complete experience.\n\nOverall Get Out is nothing short of a fantastic horror/thriller. The story is relevant, the finished product is absolutely beautiful, and the cast sells this film incredibly well. While it is a bit predictable at times, Jordan Peele's directorial debut is a triumph and gives us as the audience something to enjoy as well as think about.",

Get Out does a good job combining horror and satire in portraying the horror of white supremacy. Excellent cast and great acting. Nevertheless, I could not help but cringe at certain times of the movie. The dialogue seems a bit odd and, quite frankly, very unrealistic. The way Chris asks his girlfriend if his family knows he's black. Why would he ask his girlfriend that if his parents know he's black in such a grave manner as if he already knows it will be a problem for her parents? Or the moment when the white elitist families ask Chris if he plays sports and ask how athletic he is. Now isn't that a bit of generalization to say a statement like that. That just assumes that all blacks are athletic human beings. Other than those odd moments, Get Out is a pretty good movie overall.",

It's shot really well and looks great (nice effort from first-time director Peele), with some smart use of the Alabama location and a good score. The premise is purposefully cryptic: \"African-American man visits his Caucasian girlfriend's mysterious family estate\". Chris (Kaluuya) is meeting Rose (Williams) parents - Missy (Keener) & Dean (Whitford) - for the first time, and they welcome him with open arms, even if the servants seem off.\n\nIt's not all about race, but it is a key aspect of the film and handled quite well. The two leads easily carry the film, both having some great scenes. However, the best bits are probably whenever Chris' friend Rod (Howery) is on screen, being hilarious and boisterous, even though often by phone. The humour and some slow bits do well to make the surprises seem even more shocking. \n\nThe twist isn't as big as 'Cabin in the Woods' or 'The Sixth Sense', but the final 20min is certainly one of the better endings to a thriller/horror film you'll see for a while! Bit of a slow build up in parts, but a very exciting finish and it's all over in 100min.",

Everybody in the film was pretty great; let's not forget that it's technically a horror movie, a genre known for bad acting, and what we get here was amazing by comparison.\n\n2.) Predictable -- Okay, if you're calling it \"predictable\" then I'm pretty sure you didn't actually watch (or finish) the movie. Of course we knew the basic premise from the trailer, but nobody could have predicted the reveal in Act 3.\n\nThis movie has a 99% rating for a reason and calling it the \"worst movie I've ever seen\" is just silly. It's also not really \"racist\" and even if it was, get over it -- white people can deal with a little racism after decades of films, tv shows, cartoons, etc that are racist as hell. Just look at pre-1950's cartoon.\n\nThe one critique I can kind of understand is that it's not particularly \"scary,\" but what exactly were you expecting? It's more of a creepy psychological thriller with a slow burn. Also, I'd say this wouldn't be as scary to white people for obvious reasons, so there's that.",

There is more creepiness and dark humour than proper horror here, even though the last 15 minutes is pure blood and gore and all the more satisfying for it. Peele\u0092s directing is assured and his own script delivers an unsettling something\u0092s not quite right feeling against the idyllic and very white suburbia setting, while Bradley Whitford, Allison Williams and Catherine Keener bring The Stepford Wives/Rosemary\u0092s Baby vibe on. Perhaps it is done so well, there seems to be little room left for any doubts or surprises on the fate of the unsuspecting black boyfriend, played with wide-eyed innocence by newcomer Daniel Kaluuya. As with most films of this genre, the final act has convenient plot contrivances that are papered over by one-liners but it is to the film\u0092s credit that it still never loses its charm or its hold over its audience. While the film touches on issues such as race and race relations, this Twilight Zone take on Guess Who\u0092s Coming to Dinner is clever and thoughtful, timely even, but hardly groundbreaking and its satirical value is limited. In other words, one shouldn\u0092t read too much into what is essentially a fun piece of escapist entertainment.",

            "content": "Alright, let's talk about Get Out, a directorial debut by Jordan Peele (of Comedy Central's Key & Peele) who also wrote and produced the film. Movies in the horror genre are not extremely difficult to make and are often the most criticized due to the repetitiveness of their plot lines (someone/something is haunted, unstoppable killer is on the loose, bodily fluids aplenty, you get the idea). However, Get Out succeeds in this category by targeting racism head on in an unexpected way and injecting an even amount of comedy in the film to keep audiences both enthralled in laughter and frightened at the reality of its premise.\n\nAfter opening with a scene of a black man getting kidnapped in the dead of night, Get Out begins with biracial couple Chris Washington and Rose Armitage who are packing for a trip to meet and spend the weekend with Rose's parents. Rose sees this as the perfect opportunity for her family to meet Chris, yet Chris is slightly nervous to meet them because he is black and Rose (and her liberal family) are white. Rose assures him that her parents are quite liberal and excepting, making his tension simmer but not dilute itself completely by this reassurance. As Rose and Chris arrive to her parents home, they meet Rose's father Dean (a successful surgeon), her mother Missy (a hypnotherapist), and her off-kilter brother Jeremy. Chris also meets the house gardener and the maid, who are black and seem harmless enough but slightly off. Things start to take an immediate turn into twilight zone as Chris is hypnotized by Missy on the first evening of his stay, after sneaking to smoke a cigarette, and begins to notice strange patterns within the few black people he meets; especially during a \"planned\" Armitage family get-together throughout the weekend that Rose conveniently forgot to mention to Chris. His paranoia leads him to conclude that something is definitely wrong and as he tries to escape, (aided via phone by his best friend Rod, played by a hysterically terrific LilRey Howery) he uncovers a horrific truth about the inner workings of the Armitage family.\n\nThe uneasiness of this premise alone echoes memories of the Sidney Poitier classic \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?\" in which a \"free-thinking\" white woman introduces her black doctor fiance to her parents; a break-out progressive film of it's time back in 1967. The comedy and progressive ideology of that film blends with the racial and social tensions of Get Out which lead to an intelligent horror film. Daniel Kaluuya grounds the audience with a realistic portrayal (finally) of what a person in a horrifically charged situation like this would do and brings gravity to his character's narrative and backstory. What Daniel's character, Chris, uncovers of what exactly happens to the black community here may come as an unexpected twist but one that is expertly thought out and executed, leaving audiences talking and pondering about the nature of these ideas for sometime to come. Jordan Peele masterfully interjects these radical notions with precision and excellent timing, striking a balance between horror, comedy, and critical thinking; Get Out is laced with social commentary on the state of what it is to be a black male in today's society but also turns that idea on its head in this racially divided world. In many ways, Get Out manages to break these barriers and delivers an impressive commentary on the way the world views race relations today while entertaining and scaring the hell out of everyone. Get Out stands as one of this best films of the year so far, one everyone should make an effort to see.",

We just have to go along with the fact that the twist works. Okay, I can suspend my disbelief, so I can go along with it, but I'm not going to rave about it as much as some of the critics have. One of the things that annoyed me, and that annoys me about films in general, is the choice to show violence against men, but avoid showing violence against women (apart from one pivotal moment - I won't spoil it). It annoys me that it's socially acceptable to have the dad be a drag, while the mum is so mature and smart. If you're still reading this after my comment about showing violence against both men and women, I wrote it because men are more likely to be victims of violence and twice as likely to be murdered - it is no consolation to the *victim* that men are 9 times more likely to be violent. We need to stop violence against women in society, but even more so, we need to stop violence against men. If we can show violence against men in films, then we should also show it against women.

            "content": "Jordan Peele's directorial debut, Get Out, is a must see thriller.  In a film that finally shows a Black-American being attacked and targeted by a white majority, Peele was able to pull off suspense and intrigue.  We're so used to seeing the black person in the movie as a villain, a savage, and a drug-using/dealing criminal.   In this film, we see it being the exact opposite.  The Black-Americans in this film are honest, law abiding citizens who are respectable, just like they're-shockingly enough in Hollywood- normal people living normal lives.  This film paints a different picture than the ones we are used to seeing in a Hollywood film.\n\n\n\"Do they know I'm Black?\"         My dad would vote for Obama a third time if he could, she says, as if to comfort his unease about meeting her white parents.  That about sums up the other characters interactions with him as well.\n\nImagine going to go meet the parents and being caught up in a culture that seemingly is overly \"I'm not racist.\"- That is to say, the people who mean well, but still say and do racist things.\n\nHowever, moving past that, this film manages to do something that many films before it have failed to do.  It manages to actually psych out the audience.  This movie left audiences on the edge of their seats.  The use of camera movements to portray a deeper story and to add to the raw emotions is outstanding.  The use of silence to fill a gap and leave the audience in suspense works perfectly.  The score added into the silent acting and use of camera\n\nAllison Williams is cast perfectly as the loving, adoring girlfriend, Rose, who doesn't care that her boyfriend is black and who gets along exquisitely with Chris's (Daniel Kaluuya) best friend, Rod.\n\nFrom the time we meet Rose's family, Chris feels uncomfortable, we can see and feel that.  Perhaps that it is the off-handed racism, perhaps it's a gut feeling.  Every time we see another black character, we see Chris getting more and more uncomfortable everything.  This comes to a tipping point when we see Lakeith Stanford's character, Andrew, lunge at our protagonist just for taking a picture of him after hearing and seeing the way he was speaking as if he were a cultured person living in a bygone era.\n\nAfter this, things escalate from thriller to full-blown horror film that can leave audience members shocked if they aren't ready for it.\n\nPeele manages to pull together so many underlying tones and bring them into the spotlight without the audience even knowing.  Audiences of all racial backgrounds have something to make them shift uncomfortably during this film because of it.  One such tone is the ode to slave auctions.  You'll have to watch the film to know where this comes from.  The feeling Chris has when he \"sink[s] into the floor\" is another one.\n\nOverall, this film masterfully addresses the issues of anti-black rhetoric in America and can leave some white audience members uncomfortable and hateful of the film, but other folks deeply in love with the film and its relevance to today's world.\n\n9.7/10",

I found \"Get Out\" to be quite overrated, in an almost symbolic way. \n\nIt's like white people are afraid to criticize this movie because they don't want to resemble the white characters in the movie.

You don't have to go out of your way to prove you're not racist.\n\nEvery single white character in this film, without exception, outwardly worships black people (they're stronger, better at taking photographs, smarter, have bigger penises, are faster etc.) but they're internally, quietly racist against them. This is a silly, shallow concept.\n\nThe black characters in the movie are strong, smart, superior. The white characters are hollow, shallow, and inferior. A far from nuanced approach to racial relations in America.\n\nThe movie is funny, it's got a few good scares. The TSA agent (his name escapes me) is a great comic relief, and has the most sense of any character in the picture.\n\nBut, the film is somewhat hollow. It's being heralded as some subversive peek behind the scenes of America's racial tensions, but... t's simply not.\n\nWhen the Doctor is asked, \"Why us?

Get Out follows Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya), a young black man who's been in a five-month relationship with his Caucasian girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams.) Rose hasn't told her family that she is dating a black man & Chris is a little worried about how they are going to react when Rose takes him to meet the family for the weekend. Upon arriving at the private estate, Chris meets Rose's parents Dr. Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford), a neurosurgeon & Dr. Missy Armitage (Catherine Keener), a creepy hypnotherapist as well as Rose's brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones). While being given a tour of the house by Dean, Chris is curious to note that the family have two black servants working for them; Walter the groundskeeper (Marcus Henderson) & Georgina the maid/housekeeper (Betty Gabriel.) Dean tells Chris that the the two used to work for Dean's parents & he didn't feel comfortable letting them go after his parents' deaths. After a night of witnessing strange behavior by Walter & Georgina, Chris becomes uneasy, especially during the family's spring party featuring only older white people whose demeanor with Chris makes him distinctly uncomfortable. Realizing that he needs to \"Get Out\" of there, Chris soon discovers the horrifying truth of what can happen to black people when they ended up in an unfamiliar place. As a first time writer & director, Jorden Peele has made a smartly intense horror film with some very dark humor & chilling twists. The performances from the cast were phenomenal. Catherine Keener was scarier than hell. Get Out is s MUST-SEE FILM.",

The acting is top-notch across the board and Peele has a sure hand building suspense, creeping dread, and eventually all-out terror. And it's funny.",

            "content": "There has been a substantial amount of ink spilled over the mega-successful horror-thriller Get Out, and I almost feel I have little to contribute that hasn't already been said before and better.  But, as a hack critic I do try to evaluate movies on their merits nevertheless, so if you are looking for grandiose social commentary this is not the place.  You're here to see if this movie is worth your money or time.  In short, yes, Get Out is a taut and well-crafted picture with a relevant message on its mind and if you are one of the hundred people in North America who has not seen it, you probably need to take care of that.  The main plot centers around a young African-American male and his white girlfriend making the big step of visiting her upper-middle class family and meeting her neighbors.  But clearly something is amiss...  Get Out functions as a hybrid of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, The Stepford Wives, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers.      \n\nMost notably the film's messaging seems appropriate for the nightmare that is Donald Trump's America, but Get Out has daggers for upper-middle class liberals with seemingly good intentions but hidden racist actions and ideals.  The setting almost seems to betray the truth.  The white family in question lives in an upscale home that resembles a Georgian manor complete with black servants.  And in a location that looks more rural Deep South than suburban Connecticut.  (It's not subtle but people are pretty fuckin dumb so you have to scream PLANTATION for them to get it.)  The main character is a presented as a bit of an everyman played by Daniel Kaluuya, but it's interesting to watch how he interacts with different people and he displays a healthy amount of wit.  Allison Williams gives the most multilayered performance, as she starts the film as a sympathetic girlfriend character and becomes something else quite entirely.  Oh, and Lil Rel Howery proved hilarious in a movie that I didn't realize needed a good laugh or two along the way.  Jordan Peele proves a competent director for the most part, especially with atmosphere and tension.  In fact, I would say about 75% of the film is downright untouchable.  However, Get Out does become a bit absurd toward the end, and where the first two acts were in line with a Twilight Zone episode, the last twenty minutes more closely resemble a grindhouse or exploitation movie.  I get the allure of revenge fantasy, considering the subject matter, but I'm docking off points for the mindless indulgence out of left field.  \n\nIn summation, yes Get Out is a competent thriller dealing with social issues that you will need to see as it will be a topic and reference point in our pop culture discussion for years to come.  And it's pretty damn creepy too.  So there's that.  Get in.",

I still want everyone to see this movie in the theater, because movies like this need to make more money so the studios can see that people want more movies like this. But I want this movie to be even better, like I thought it was going to be. \n\nSo why couldn't I give it five stars? The biggest reason is I felt it dumbed itself down. To me this film was taking a big chance that is rarely done in movies today, especially horror-esque ones. Not only talking about the race issue, but showing the horrific feelings and realities that people face every day. \n\nAnd then along comes the scene in the bathroom after the mainly white, old people party, where Rose and Chris are getting ready for bed. Rose mentions every racist thing that the people did at the party. And Chris just says, \"Yup.\", because what else can he say. He deals with it regularly. So the reason it stood out to me so much was because the racist people (if they were even to go and see it), wouldn't even think twice about what Rose is reiterating, and the people who do think about racism already, are aware that the things that were done and said to Chris should not be done.\n\nAs far as the Sci-Fi aspect to this movie, it had a bit of a cheesiness to it, which worked for the most part as a tension reliever. I'm referring to the end when Chris is in the basement watching TV. \n\nAnd the horror doesn't really present itself until the last half hour of the movie. Except for the couple of jump scares earlier. In regards to the some of the horror towards the end, when Dean is downstairs in the workroom, and there are candles lit, I understood this to be part of a ritual, but I would have thought by now that there would be new and better ways to do things. I'm torn on that though. I understand the message to be that some still think racism was something that happened years ago, so keeping the basement in the past fit, but I would have also seen it more modern.\n\nIf you go in not reading any spoilers, I think most people will be surprised at how it unfolds. And Jordan Peele left the perfect amount of clues, that if you really think about it, you can probably figure out what is happening early on.\nIf you do watch it spoiler free, I think going back to watch it again is also a good idea, because you can focus more on the actor's nuances, and focus more on looking for the double and triple meanings in some of the scenes.\n\nEven with the four star rating, and some of my comments, I really do think you should see this movie. Go to the theater now and watch it, then watch it again on DVD when you've had time to digest it, and like I mentioned in the previous paragraph, you can look for deeper meanings in the scenes.",

There are a couple flaws but the rest of the film is so good that it easily eclipses them.

There are only a few jump scares and a little blood and gore, this one is far more about the atmosphere it generates.\n\nRookie director Jordan Peele hits every note just about right, making some clever comments about race relations in America (and I guess broader too).  The increasingly dark atmosphere of the movie is akin to something like Rosemary's baby, which is quite something for a rookie\n\nHighly, highly recommended",

The story itself, with it's non-overt messages on racism, is handled so precisely, or should I say, perfectly. What I especially love about Get Out is that it didn't do the things that it could have done, what someone else in the hands with this script most likely would have done. The acts of racism is smaller than the blatant racist southerner that are depicted in so many other movies trying to have that message. This is just one of the many things that made me buy into the movie.\n\nThe performances all across the board are incredible, not a single one sticks out like a sore thumb. And let me say, LilRey Howery who plays Chris Washington's (Daniel Kaluuya) comic relief friend working in TSA was a character that could have broken the movie completely, but let me tell you... it works. Like the themes of this movie, this character could have been handled so poorly, he could have been so unfunny, but he isn't... he is funny and he did get laughs from myself and the rest of the theater. That's a weird thing to say too... a horror movie with comedy? Once again, handled with care.\n\nGet Out is a horror movie that takes risks, which weren't being done that much before this one. Movies like Don't Breathe, and It Follows fit in with Get Out. Both of which I mentioned are modern horror movies with the guts to go to weird places, and I love that, it's the kind of stuff that will make you remember a movie.\n\nGet Out is a movie that I will remember. I will most likely be picking up it on Blu-Ray, and it most definitely deserves this grade.\n\nGrade: A",

            "content": "Pretty awesome concept for a horror film, but not the best execution.\nReally shocked by the high ratings on this site. And also by the genre too. Maybe I'm missing the point of the movie but I don't quite get how this is satirical. I would use the words bizarre, creepy, and interesting to describe this film. Not funny, or satirical. Though there were some hilarious moments but mostly from LilRel Howery's character Rod Williams because of how bluntly he stated his opinion on everything.\n\nThe first half hour or so of the movie was a chore to get through. And it didn't help that I wasn't sure whether I should have been laughing or been uncomfortable with the awkwardness of the introduction to Rose's family. That dinner scene in particular was very bizarre. I chuckled a couple times throughout the exchange looking at my friend thinking, \"What the hell are we watching?\". Thankfully, we get some clarity behind the entire plot, but not behind the behaviors of the characters.\n\nAnd speaking of behaviors of the characters, man was Jeremy one creepy dude. He was so creepy that I devised a theory that I was super disappointed didn't come true. With the film being so centered on racism and how mistreated blacks are by whites in the suburbs, I thought it would have been neat for the big reveal to not be centered on race as well. \n\nBut instead, we got a The Stepford Wives ordeal that doesn't really make sense. For starters, I was theorizing that the Armitage family wasn't who they said they were and that they were another family that replaced them and living inside their bodies. Or at least that a couple of them weren't. Especially with Dean saying that he used to smoke but after Missy hypnotized him, \"the sight of cigarettes appalls me,\" That wasn't as big of a deal to me. What was is the fact that when Chris rightfully asked Jim Hudson \"Why black people?\" and the reply essentially was that it wasn't the color of the skin that mattered, it was the eyes so he could see again. That made sense to me. But why only blacks? Why portray the film as a race issue? (Side note, wasn't it ironic that Jim Hudson won him in bingo as if he was bidding on a slave? Messed up but the parallel is there.) Isn't it enough that there are people out there who are so psychotic that they are willing to take another person's body and make it a vessel for another person by sending that person's conscience to the underneath?(can't remember what it was called in the film) I think that was a bit of a wasted opportunity when they could have made it into a conspiracy that was bigger than this one family and that it could have happened to anyone anywhere.\n\nUnless... I actually am right and this film has nothing to do with race and is actually about gender think about it. Rose and Missy how did they act in comparison to Dean and Jeremy? They seemed almost normal didn't they? What if Missy and Andre Hayworth's wife were behind the procedures? Then this really would be like Stepford Wives but in reverse. But then why Georgina? Oh well, a cool thought but doubt that there's any truth to it. \n\nBut that's all nitpicky. The main complaints I have are with the behaviors of Rose's family. So for their grand scheme to work, they have to take in a healthy stranger that also has to be black, get them to come into their home alone, and be relaxed enough to sit down with the Missy to be hypnotized. Note the key word relaxed. If that was the case, why the hell didn't they work to make Chris as comfortable as possible during his stay instead of the awkward fling that was the first 30 or so minutes of the film? And also, why the hell was Jeremy so damn creepy? He nearly ruined everything. And speaking of ruining everything, not only was it stupid of Rose to have a photo album of all of her previous \"boyfriends\", but why the hell would she not only have placed in a location that Chris could potentially find it in but also leave the door open for it too? Now if we assume that it wasn't Rose that left the door open but it was Georgina that opened it to help Chris to leave, then that brings up another question: Why did Georgina unplug his cell phone? Regardless of who left the door open, it's bad scripting.\n\nBut my biggest complaint was of their servants. Georgina the housemaid, played by Betty Gabriel, while she was fantastic because of how insane she seemed, and Walter, the groundskeeper, played by Marcus Henderson,  both of their roles made no sense. [I was able to figure out that they were the Dean's parents prior to the big reveal but despite that was impressed with the plan. Really unique idea that freaks me out because of the implications if such a thing was possible. But what I don't get is why they are servants at their own home? And even if it was all a ploy to make Chris not suspicious of them, then why were they so damn creepy and nonsensical with him in conversation? And why did Missy treat her mother-in-law with so much disrespect in front of Chris? If anything, they should not have been there at all so Chris wouldn't have suspected them. But they were the masters of the house right? \"Go get him Grandpa,\" Rose says to Walter. And then he asks her for the rifle so he could finish Chris off and she obeyed. Clearly she still despite being an adult respected his authority. The continuity of the whole situation didn't make sense to me.\n\nAnd my last complaint is of the hypnosis itself. There was no explanation how the hypnosis worked and how Chris fell under its effects for the first time. That could have been a quick explanation such as his food was drugged or Rose had been giving him some drugs while dating him. Instead, all we know is that the clinking of the glass with the spoon puts him and the other black people that were also hypnotized into a trance.\n\nTo summarize, this movie was neat but not anything special. It had a lot of funny moments and a satisfying ending with a lot more bloodshed then I was expecting to see. Although the ending was rushed too. What of Andre Hayworth? Is he going to be left against his will to be with his wife that is twice his age? What of Chris? Is he going to always go into a trance whenever he hears the sound of a spoon clinking on glass? And I appreciated how un-cliche that this was. While it was not exciting the entire time, I did appreciate the surprise elements of the film and the uniqueness of it all.",

Jordan Peele's debut effort as a writer/director of macabre and suspense has gone down a storm with critics and audiences alike and for good reason to; it's fantastic. Cultural appropriation is the bogyeman of this zeitgeisty comedy-come-horror-come-thriller where it's thought provoking concept is executed phenomenally. Peele's background as a comedian and sketch writer gifts him with perfect timing and pace proven in his lean story structure where not a scene goes to waste and the ending occurs naturally and fluidly. Daniel Kaluuya is at career best and is dressed up almost like a modern day african american version of Ash from the Evil Dead series. Catherine Keenar too is frighteningly fab as are the whole cast who mesh together together in the most chilling of ensembles. The score is spine tingling and the inspired choice to open with \"Redbone\" by Childish Gambino sets the tone perfectly for the film. Get Out also interestingly enough showcases how racist some (not all) horror movies can really be. It's odd to think that one of the film's greatest strengths is the real world competence and well informed nature of the african american characters is considered, from a filmic standpoint, a \"subversion\" and how it really shouldn't be seen that way. Most importantly though the suspense, horror, gore and all other typical genre tropes one would expect from a film such as Get Out don't overshadow the very real and terrifying concept that the film is conveying. Jordan Peele has on his hands one of the most intricately crafted and brilliant horror movies to come out of the US in quite some time where it's humour never feels jarring and is as razor sharp as it's more gruesome elements. If this if first of many socially aware/conscious horror movies to come from Peele then I eagerly anticipate the next one and the next one and the next one etc etc.... Biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch...",

            "content": "Oh yeah: a horror movie that is actually good. A rare bird, this, no? \n\nYou could predict the quality - or at least freshness - from the trailers but nothing will quite prepare you for this joyride which is a contender for the best horror movie of recent times, and crafty enough to satisfy also those who don't really care about horror movies. Such as me.\n\nBrother (Daniel Kaluuya) dating a white girl (Allison Williams) is dragged to her family estate for the weekend. But something is off from the very start of the journey, and it gets stranger by the minute. \n\nThere's a variety of cool cats in smaller supporting roles and you will probably not know them by name, but I will list them anyway: Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener as the mother and father, Caleb Landry Jones as the brother, Betty Gabriel as the house maid, LilRel Howery as one of the funniest cases of black guy acting like Hollywood comedy black guy I can remember. \n\nIMDb claims he is a rising stand-up comedy star, and he's surely an instant crowd-pleaser here. You will love every precious minute the guy gets to grace the screen.\n\nBut back to the movie at hand. Get Out\" is an effective horror piece but director-screenwriter Jordan Peele's ambitions are decidedly wider than that, and he can meet the high standards that he has set. \n\nIf I have to to summarize his biggest accomplishment, then I would say that Peele proves to be a master storyteller. \n\nThere's a surprising diversity and depth to material. It can be followed as social commentary (what it's like to be different; how covertly racist the modern society can be), classic horror story (adventurer braving the lands unknown) and a crafty cat-and-mouse thriller where the joy of watching rises from following how every \"chess piece\" is moved and how the others react.\n\nIn addition, there's an unexpected comic relief going on, mainly acted out by LilRey Howrey as mentioned above. And last but not least, the movie makers have really taken their time with the characters and the setting to build an natural, convincing atmosphere which can stand on its own and doesn't have to rely on cheap horror tactics as sudden horrifying noises and movements. \n\nPeele actually uses some of those too, but in a way that doesn't feel exploitative; these help to strenghten the oppressive atmosphere and further show how the main character feels.\n\nIf I may nitpick a little, the central hero deserves to have some more individuality because he mostly gets to react to awkward and/or unpleasant situations like in black version of Curb Your Enthusiasm\" or something. This one-note-performance by Kaluuya honestly gets a bit monotone before the action-filled final act.\n\nBut all in all, the chosen approach is understandable because Get Out\" is only 103 minutes long and has a lot happening. And to credit the cast one more time, everybody's offering a top-quality work, even the people in smallest roles. \n\nConsidering how much their faces are shown up-close, it's no mean feat. I'd even call it one of the most memorable ensemble movies of recent times.\n\nThere are also some pacing issues, mostly during the end which would be more hard-hitting if played out faster, especially as some major turns are not that hard to figure out by the middle. \n\nOf course, that would require attentive watching and not checking your phone all the time, as many youngsters do these days. Also, horror fans would probably like to see more gore but this is not a problem in itself. So the movie's not near perfect but what is, eh?\n\nGet Out\" is that rare kind of horror movie that really deserves some major-ass awards or nominations. Maybe Oscar noms for original screenplay, directing, and several possible picks from supporting cast (Betty Gabriel, Bradley Whitford, LilRel Howery if I can pick three). \n\nIf you liked this little gem that deserves to be called born classic, then you will be pleased to know that it's been already popular in cinemas. It only cost 4.5 million USD and has already brought 113 mil from the U.S. box office alone.\n\n\"Get Out\" is the best movie of 2017 I've seen yet. And I have seen ten! Get off your ass and run towards the cinemas!",

            "content": "Possibly the third oddly, interesting horror to hit the big screen this year following M. Night Shyamalan's Spilt and Gore Verbinski's A Cure For Wellness. Blumhouse productions seems to be enthusiastically backing Jordan's Peele's main feature debut and it's easy to see why once you've seen the film. It has to be mentioned, that the highly lucrative Blumhouse, those success was born with low budget horrors like Paranormal Activity, Insidious and the oscar nominated Whiplash certainly has an eye for incredible talent, great and original storytelling, something different,  has a knack for backing a good product, fast earning themselves quite the reputation and possibly pushing those they work with into the spotlight. \n\nJordan Peele is that next thing, but he has been around for awhile, probably best credited for writing and starring in MadTV, and commonly paired up with comedy superstar Keegan-Michael Key. And here's the thing, Peele is mostly recognised for comedy, not horror, but that shouldn't insinuate he's in the wrong field or not capable of making a damn good horror.   \n\nThe idea was born from Peele watching one of Eddie Murphy's standup routines, racial stereotypical about an African-Americans dating white women in the states. Drawing influence from the original Night of the Living Dead and the Stepford Wives. It's actually hard to talk openly about the premise without giving anything but if there's anything you should know from the trailers, black folk have been disappearing in the suburbs and this girl's family certainly has something to do with it.  \n\nThere's a proper cheer from me seeing Daniel Kaluuya taking lead as the protagonist boyfriend allured by his girlfriend to meet the parents. I first saw Kaluuya in the British mini series The Fades as the geeky companion to the hero. He was such a joy to watch, he quickly become my favourite character so I'm generally always happy to see him land these larger roles. He's brilliant, even with a faux American accent. \n\nThe supporting cast are great too, all of them adding that eerie believability that something is certainly amiss, but never actually being able to put your figure on it entirely. It was War On Everyone's Caleb Landry Jones and The Purge's Betty Gabriel that blew me away, both being very uncomfortable to watch, Jones' character being very intimidating and Gabriel's just being weirdly over polite that was very unsettling. \n\nJust when you think you know what it's all about, there's a twist. The tension that builds huge, however, unfortunately, even though being in a full screening, there was a real lack of scares. It misses that expected knockout punch and falls in the final round, leaving me just bewildered than frightened. It might be the comedy that makes light of the situation that takes away the impact. \n\nNonetheless, it's beautifully made, well shot, creative and the sets reminded me of The Shining. Silence of the Lambs another film I thought of watching this. Michael Abels does a terrifying score that really emphasises the chillness, paying some attention to the looming mystery that's slowly unfolding. \n\nUnfortunately for me, I think the timing of the comedy knocked the out the peaks of my intrigue, which then became anticlimactic for me. It'll certainly scare many people, freak them out, but as with a lot of horrors, what I find scary, won't be scary to someone else. \n\nRunning Time: 8\nThe Cast: 8\nPerformance: 8\nDirection: 8\nStory: 7\nScript: 6\nCreativity: 8\nSoundtrack: 7\nJob Description: 4\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 0\n\n64% 6/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

            "content": "A Cogent, Realistic, Psychological Thriller? Get Out!\n\nIt has been a long-time running unspoken rule when making horror movie protagonists: the audience must feel superior to the character. This is why we find ourselves often pulling our hair out wondering why someone could be so stupid as to check the basement at midnight, or continue to live in a clearly haunted house when it would be healthier to live in a van down by the river. Writer and director Jordan Peele ignored that rule as he crafts the most organic horror in cinema history.\n\nThe twisted tale begins innocently as a young, interracial couple Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose (Allison Williams) decide to visit Rose\u00e2??s parents after having been dating for a few months. Rose\u00e2??s parents, it turns out, live in a very secluded manor tucked into the woods where everyone\u00e2??s behaviour seems just a little\u00e2?\u00a6 off. Is their racial ignorance merely a symptom of living in a heavily predominantly white society, or is it something more sinister?\n\nWhat Peele cleverly manages to do here is put the entire \u00e2??horror movie\u00e2?? concept into perspective. Largely thanks to M. Night Shyamalan, the viewer of any horror movie finds oneself constantly guessing what\u00e2??s going to happen next. Being a page ahead in the script makes the viewer feel more secure, and less likely to be startled. What happens when a viewer is trying to guess what is going on in this aberrant tale, is that they break down possibilities as such: best-case scenario is that this nice young black man is in the woods with a large group of creepy racists. This is the best-case scenario because it doesn\u00e2??t involve supernatural-horror influences, just regular-horror influences. Worst-case scenario is left up to the audience's\u00e2?? imaginations. Now, I won\u00e2??t divulge here what the situation happened to be (you should go find out for yourself), but the mere fact that a sizable portion of the tension of this horror movie doesn\u00e2??t come from something out of this world, or a one-in-a-million chance run-in with a psychotic killer, but from a very real and present social issue, this makes the movie feel more real and natural than just about any horror film to date. It\u00e2??s truly artistic the way they made the audience question the degree of sinisterness of racial tension in general.\n\nThis organic-feel didn\u00e2??t stop at incorporating day-to-day threats, though. As previously stated, the sense of superiority to the main character is non-existent for this film, and as such caused the audience to relate to Chris more, bringing them into his experiences. How did Peele accomplish this feat? Simple: good writing. The movie didn\u00e2??t rely on suspension of belief for the audience to accept Chris\u00e2?? predicament. Instead, it relied on a carefully constructed storyline that left no holes, and very strong character building, leading the audience to understand that Chris is in a genuine predicament through no fault of his own, and not guilty of hubris like some kids with a video camera looking for a witch in the woods for whatever reason.\n\nGet Out still provides other elements found in horror (jump scares, twisting plots, hair-raising music, etc.), added to that extra level of connection, while having a heavy theme of racial isolation and prejudice. By doing so, Peele effectively puts his audience through the fearful and helpless emotions we\u00e2??re used to while watching horror, but superimposing this over someone feeling desperately culturally victimized. The mix of emotions in this situation causes an audience to truly empathize with the misunderstood character. This is truly art, and Get Out wins. It wins at movie-ing. Go see it because it\u00e2??s a real thriller. Go see it because of its unique plot. Go see it because of its social discussion. Whichever reason appeals to you, it doesn\u00e2??t matter. It is a real piece of art you won\u00e2??t want to miss. You should get out, and go see it.",

Biting, incisive, frightening, and funny, this is the total package, a movie with something to say even as it constantly entertains.  Peele, brilliantly, does not take the obvious (read: stupid) route that this sort of social commentary could have gone, and instead focuses on a particular brand of unintentional and detached condescension, which he proceeds to absolutely skewer.  Peele's story is totally unafraid of uncomfortable moments, and it's wonderful when a filmmaker feels like he's showing you something subversive, and his writing is razor sharp.  He also reveals himself to be incredibly genre literate; the specter of the works of Ira Levin and things like INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS can be felt (in a very good way, even as the movie's story never rips anything off), and the way he shoots the more suspenseful moments is incredibly effective.  There are sequences here of tremendous tension and unease, and save a couple of unnecessary, cheap-o jump scares, the horrific component of the movie is unassailable.  The movie is also genuinely funny (much of the humor courtesy of secret weapon Howery, who basically walks off with the entire film), but the humor never undercuts the stakes; there is real danger at play for our hero, and his emotional state is always played for real (and is very well conveyed by Kaluuya).  GET OUT accomplishes many things, most important of which is that it becomes an incredibly satisfying, crowd-pleasing genre effort.  It's one of 2017's best films.",

Shocking and funny with so many twists just WOW honestly.\nThe protagonist of the movie, Chris is invited by his girlfriend Rose to meet her parents during a weekend getaway. Chris is curious about her parents' reaction to their daughter's interracial relationship since she never told them that she is in a relationship with a black guy. As the weekend progresses, shocking truths are revealed where the urge to GET OUT is necessary. Once he arrives to her home the environment just automatically shouts something odd with her family only having black workers. They try to normalize that to him but still comes across as strange. From the start of an awkward warm welcome from the parents to an uncomfortable lawn party with family and friends. \nIt is suspenseful and psychological terror with the right amount of humor.

But in the case of a film like \"Get Out\", the answer is very much \"yes\". \"Get Out\" is a movie of contradictions. As opposed to being a weakness, the contradictions are completely the point and the movie radiates with them.\n\nThis is the directorial debut of Jordan Peele. Better known as the second half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, a duo that has forayed into the movies since the end of their series. Last year it was the comedy \"Keanu\" and now we have Peele by himself behind the camera. For a directorial debut, he shows a real eye for using the camera as an integral aspect of storytelling. Also, he seems to inherently understand what makes good horror work: it's not necessarily what you see that scares you, but what lurks just out of sight.\n\nFurther, if this movie was just a skillfully directed horror piece that would be impressive enough, but hung within this horror framework are instances when it also manages to be an entertaining comedy. Without giving anything away, there are two moments of spectacularly jarring musical choices that should jolt the audience out of the movie. Nevertheless, due to the way that the movie is woven together, they become humorous moments without breaking any of the tension.\n\nIf all you want is a horror movie that avoids the worst cliches of the genre (e.g. annoying characters doing truly stupid things) then you should enjoy yourself just fine. However, there is so much more to uncover within this movie.\n\nYou might be able to guess from the ads that racism plays a pivotal role in this movie. Yet, no one in this movie gives the appearance of being a traditional racist. The movie is much to savvy to depict stereotypical racism. Instead, it delves into far more insidious forms of racism and, by doing so, many of the same story elements could be used to examine any form of prejudice.\n\nOn closer inspection, this film exceeds the expectations of a comedic horror movie wherein brain transplant surgery is a real thing. Just as with prejudice, if you take this film at face value, then you've missed the subtle undertones that give life depth.  Peele retells a moral told many times before, yet somehow manages to make it feel fresh and interesting.\n\nPeele's directing career is off to a very strong start. I'm exciting to see what he makes next.",

Initially, Chris is accommodated warmly by the parents, believing this is their attempt to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of disturbing truths leads him to discover something unimaginable. \n\nOn display throughout the film is the comically affable setup by the house help and the inadvertent, uneasily revealing, racism from the family. Our protagonist Chris is in a suspenseful position, he's on a weekend getaway to meet his white girlfriend's parents and family members while being mindful of the awkwardly warm welcome he is receiving. The family members and friends, on the annual lawn party, try to engage with Chris and they end up making him uncomfortable. Rose's father says 'I would've voted for Obama if he had a third term.' A former golf player tells Chris he knew Tiger Woods. And another guest, a black guest, shakes Chris' hand when offered a fist bump. The setup seems like a sitcom rousing a social farce. \n\n'Get Out' triumphs from its execution, deftly knowing when to deploy and balance the suspense and humor. It's all playful yet flinch and the next thing you know, you're at the edge of your seat.  \n\n'Get Out' is most definitely a horror film than a comedy. Fans of the genre won't be surprised by the plot, the excess of violence, and chaos. Though what will surprise them, and much of the audience, is the incorporation of racial paranoia as it happens to be the basis for the violence. This film is an attack on the tension surrounding the questions of the marginalized, which the film replies with a death stare. \n\nOverall, 'Get Out' is unforgettable, despite that it matches the tropes of conventional horror/thriller films, because of how it handles the spirit of the matter while making it a solid film to enjoy.",

The boyfriend is concerned that her parents won't tolerate their interracial relationship. What unfolds is a horror comedy where the boyfriend makes a dark discovery about the family and its intentions. This film is bizarre and twisted in ways I can't describe without spoiling. I found it unnerving but also not fleshed out enough. It is hard to give a concise review without spoiling this film, but. Suffice it to say it is bizarre and twisted in every sense of the word. It is also exceptionally racist. I am reminded of Margaret Sanger from this movie. Watchable but underdeveloped ------------------------------------- B-",

            "content": "One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. In order for a spooky film to be spooky, the characters have to make the same decisions you would make. Thats a mandatory for pretty much every movie, but especially scary ones. This main character, (Chris), had so many opportunities to realize he needs to get the fuck out of there ASAP. The whole first night was a completely twisted situation, once the grounds keeper had solidified it was not a dream, Chris should have been packing his bags. The grounds keeper was sprinting in the dead of night in the dark and Chris didnt even question him on why exercise at night? The mother hipnotized him against his will and he doesnt want to make a big deal out of it? Plus, how could Chris not realize the mother was up to something when she does the cliche turn on light while sitting in the dark and then stirs her tea without sipping immediately after discussing hypnosis. The pinnacle being when he snapped the photo and the flash sent the brain swapped black man who had been missing into a panic. I understand Chris staying with his girl for a bit by the sunset, sex makes you stupid, but  he easily could have said he wanted to take her car now and she could stay to collect his stuff instead of him hanging out for the next hour until the Sun is down. Any reasonable girlfriend wouldnt force their guy to stay somewheres they feel in danger. Now that its clear it should have never gotten to the second evening to want to get the fuck out of there. \n\n     When the evening comes and its just the family at home they double down on the character decisions that make no sense. First off, Rose being against him shouldve been considered by him when she couldnt find the keys. I mean shes fairly young and these are her parents not some distant Uncles shes never met, dont you think maybe just maybe shes one of them since she is literally one of them. As soon as she couldnt find the keys i wouldve been grabbing the bag. As a matter of fact,  why would she actually have them after all? They knew shit was going down that night and they didnt think marybe this guy could pull off a miracle and steal the unhidden keys and drive away? I mean the only physical threat was the brother who armed himself with the lacrosse stick (instead of the gun!!!) and the mom with her cup. Its unlikely for him to make it out but shit happens. Now that hes been captured and is tied and the truth comes out (ill get to that later).  The brother comes to get Chris for the surgery, why would the brother just assume Chris is asleep and how could he not notice Chris getting into that very advantageous hitting position when he is one foot away? Chris then presumably kills the brother based on the blood coming from the blunt trauma to the head, i mean he hit him a few good times with a rock basically. Chris then goes onto kill the father with antlers from a deer head. Did Chris forget that UFC was too hardcore for him? Because he isnt even flinching, but its life or purgatory so ill let it slide since this may be the first rational move by Chris. Now Chris is finally smart enough to smash the moms tea cup and blocks a knife with his palm (badass shit, ill let it slide for the previous reasons). As Chris leaves, the brother comes back despite a major head injury and instead of using the gun they have, he musters up some serious energy to go for the rear naked choke but at no surprise fails, This time the brother is dead right? Rose still heard none of this (some damn good noise cancelling ear buds she has!). As Chris makes his escape he forgets that hes been told all the black people are really white people and decides to pick up the grandma who hasnt forgotten who she is. Chris being attacked by the grandpa and Rose (who brought a gun) . Chris is smart enough to take a picture as a last ditch resort. Rose seems to have forgotten that taking a picture of these transferred mind people makes them crazy. So she gives the man shes assuming is still her grandpa the gun and old man jenkins finishes her and himself off leaving Chris a free man. \n\n   Now i havennt forgotten the best friends side story in this. The best friend was well done. The two main problems with his story though are how unbelievably the police handled his information (just ridiculously unbelievable) and how he got a cop car. Plus why did Chris ask how he found him? Why wouldnt Chris have texted him the address he was at? \n\n    In terms of being a comedy, it had its few moments to get laughs with the cliche sitting in the dark to turning a light on surprise scene and when they have a big blown up picture of Chris while voting like they were frat bros voting on new pledges. \n\n   The key problem with this movie was that none of the decisions make sense. As i write this review i realize this may have been a spoof on horror films. If so, it wasnt that bad....",

I was so wrong!  Get Out is marvelous thriller that kept shocking me with revelations throughout.  I can't remember the last time I walked out of a movie so thoroughly impressed by the way the director and his team paid attention to every minute detail.  While I can't describe exactly what is meant by everything, it seemed that every prop, every line of dialogue, and every shot was telling me something important.  It's the kind of movie that has a great surface-level story, but if you are willing to dig in deeper, there's so much more to see.  In particular, the film has a lot to say about the modern state of racism in America.\n \nAs with all the best movies, Get Out still has me thinking about it days later.  The great thing about this movie is that, as I stew on it, I keep realizing new things I missed the first time through.  Every time I try to find a flaw, suddenly I realize that it makes perfect sense in light of later revelations.  One of the things that I was afraid would never work are the moments that seem manufactured just to build tension.  They have people acting in odd ways and typical jump scares, and I was ready to write them off as pointless nonsense used to meet the horror quota.  But on reflection it all fits in ways that I didn't even see on first glance.  More than most movies, I think Get Out will benefit from a second watch because you can put all the pieces together when you know the ending.\n \nEveryone in the cast of this movie absolutely nails their part.  I could run down the list, but it would just exhaust every positive adjective I know.  Most of the cast is forced to play very nuanced roles and some of them even have to adjust later in the movie because of certain plot points.  Of special note is the star Daniel Kaluuya who has a perfect American accent, that never betrays his actual country of origin.  When a movie is as well-acted, well-plotted, and well-shot as this you have to give a massive amount of credit to the writer-director Jordan Peele.  You can tell that he has a real passion for these kind of movies because of how he manages to pay homage to them, and he even takes familiar tropes and turns them around.  Get Out is one of the smartest movies I've seen in a long time and it transcends any one genre.  I highly recommend it.",

This took away from the complexity of the story-line and any build up of suspense, making the movie predetermined and predictable. It's almost as if the writers got lazy, so they decided to have the overpowered protagonist kill everyone. I found the concepts introduced in the movie were lacking in terms of depth, and speaking of depth, they could have delved much deeper into some of the other characters pasts-like the mother, to better fully develop the setting and relation to the characters. I don't think the movie was meant to be Oscar-winning, or even that serious. \n\nDefinitely not a memorable movie, overall it was OK, not that bad, but not great.",

Honestly I wasn't expecting much as it was written and directed by a comedian but I have to say Jordan Peele has done an excellent job with this film. \n\nThis movie is a horror flick but for me Get Out should be placed in its own special category. While most horror movies tend to frighten its viewers through jump scares, climax-rising music, and people walking down hallways, the scares from Get Out come from the mind using hypnosis, which is why I'd' list this as psychological horror. \n\nThe movie centres around an African-American photographer named Chris as he and his caucasian girlfriend Rose head out of town to visit her parents. Chris is very intimidated as Rose's parents are oblivious to the fact that he is black. When they arrive, everything seems to go smooth as he realizes her parents are acting in a very peculiar and unsettling manner in a nervous attempt to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship. Gradually, he finds out disturbing discoveries that lead him to an unthinkable truth. \n\nNow I'm no movie-spoiler, but just a tip to really pay attention at the beginning of the movie. Like, don't even blink. You'll find out later.  I realized that the whole point of the movie is to use horror and suspense as a tool to bring people more aware of modern-day stereotyping, nd I feel that Jordan Peele couln't have done that any better. There are unexpected twists, jump scares, and people walking down dark corridors that just add to the amazing horror experience. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and although it's only March I believe that this has got to be the top movie of the year.",

            "content": "There are very few films each year that leave a lasting impact on its audience, but I can definitely see Get Out being one of the films remembered by the average moviegoing audience in 2017. When it comes to horror/thrillers I have been known to be turned off by most. I enjoy filmmaking in general as much as the next person, but the genre doesn't really do all that much for me, unless it's fantastic. To my surprise, this film is fantastic in many more ways than one. Shocking, disturbing, cringe-worthy (in a good way), and just downright smart, here is why I believe the audiences who only casually go to the cinemas will be calling Get Out one of their favourite films of the year. \n\nRacism has been a thing since the beginning of time. Nowadays, most of the world has accepted people as people and the division has vanished. That being said, there are still cases where stories like this can be extremely relevant. Now, take segregation and crank it up to a million. Then, and only then will you have Get Out. Following Chris as his girlfriend Rose takes him to meet her family for the first time, it begins as more of a romantic comedy. The tension starts when you see that he is a man of colour and she is not. Her entire family is Caucasian and clearly has something against his race. Using his race as slaves around their house, their behaviour seems off from the start. Seeming to be one big set-up for him, things begin to get uncomfortable at a rapid rate. If giving this film a perfect score meant it having an excessive amount of tension, then Get Out receives an A+ in my book. \n\nMade famous by his show Key & Peele, Jordan Peele writes and directs this film as his first effort out of the gate. If this film is any indication of his continuing talent, then this man has an even brighter future ahead of him than he already has now. Everything about the direction in this film is picture-perfect. From delivering a light tone with some very dark comedy throughout some very tense moments, to having the actors/actresses cry as they keep a straight face, there are so many elements that were probably extremely difficult to pull off here. I found myself in awe at how well this film was put together. For such a low budget and such a large box office return as of now, it just goes to show that people will see an original film after all. \n\nAlthough Daniel Kaluuya's portrayal of Chris is award-worthy in my humble opinion and the rest of the cast surrounding him gives it their all, making for an absolutely moving picture, my favourite actor in the film was easily LilRey Howrey. Portraying the best friend of Chris and the much needed comedic relief, his moments brought a sense of relief in an otherwise tension-filled film. From tears to death, this film isn't afraid to go all out, so it was very nice to see that a comedian (Peele) could bring a sense of humanity to his script in a film that is not supposed to be taken too seriously. There are many laughs to be had, many jumps, and a few great twists, but the best portion of this film is the fact that it's not afraid to balance it all with a bit of levity. \n\nIn the end, Get Out is the type of film that escalates so much by the time that it reaches the third act, making it impossible to not stir up a conversation between its viewers. For all viewers who can accept a bit of an overblown finale, this film will definitely make people talk. For that reason alone, along with the fact that it's cleverly written, well-acted, and very well-directed, Get Out will be able to impress horror fans, fans of tension, fans of a great story, and fans who just love to see a film stay consistently great and surprising throughout. The screening I attended has people applauding at certain moments and I can't see audiences dying down anytime soon. This film is making bank and there is a good reason for that. From beginning to end, Get Out is incredibly impressive. There are a few unexplained things that I wish had a bit more detail, but in the scheme of things, it's just a speeding ticket. I love Get Out and it's one of the best of this young year so far.",

If I had never seen the preview, I would have enjoyed this movie immensely, but the trailer just straight ruined the movie.  Then, once you get passed the areas of the movie that were spoiled by the trailer, the movie telegraphs too often.  Let the audience be shocked and confused instead of letting us know a reveal before the surprise.  \n\nPositives.  There was a moment I completely felt the intense dread, and uncertainty in a situation, and felt the protagonist's situation in my gut....great scene.  Even though the movie delves heavily into race, it deals mainly in interracial awkwardness rather than out and out racism.  I think it handled the race portion well, which reading the negative reviews seems to be where the dislike came from many.  \n\nDecent movie, not a 99% in my opinion, but worth a watch, and if possible avoid the preview.",

Are you just shoving scenarios onto my face, that you've been dying to see in a movie yourself?\" All through the movie I kept waiting for the crux; the show-stopping moment, be in the form of tragic comedy, tragedy or even wit alone, just something that evoked a visceral feeling that I would take home with me. Just something that would make me feel like, Yes! Finally, the movie has begun. Sadly, that moment never came for me. It looked like Peele, through this movie was trying to convey too many things, doing justice to none, really. The horror element was there, just not enough. The racial element was there, just not enough. The comedy was there, again, just not enough. I ended up leaving the movies feeling immensely dissatisfied.

So this is about a young African-American man (Daniel Kaluuya) who meets the family of his Caucasian girlfriend (Allison Williams) for the first time.  They've got money for days, so who really knows what they are up to behind closed doors of their secluded estate?  As you may or may not already know, this is from Jordan Peele, who makes up half of the comedy duo Key and Peele.  He writes and directs here, but he also wrote the misfire Keanu, so I had mixed expectations for this... that is, before all of the overwhelming positive word of mouth and glowing reviews started to roll in.  He has put together one of the smartest horror movies of the decade in Get Out, so I give him a major tip of my hat.  With race relations being the way that they are in this country, not only is this movie welcome, it's actually needed, and it makes social commentary for days.  Jordan Peele has also gone on the record and said that this is a movie that is designed to be seen in a theater, and if you wait for the home market, you're missing out on a large part of the intended experience.  Obviously, this is his baby, so he knows what he is talking about, but I had such a great time watching this in a theater filled with an audience of different ethnicities, I absolutely agree with him.  You know the stereotype of someone that talks at the horror movie and interacts with the person sitting next to him/her?  Someone that would yell at the screen for the protagonist to... well, get out?  This movie has an actual character that does that for you.  The best friend character (LilRel Howery) who is present almost entirely via cell phone always says the exact thought that is on the entire audience's mind, and it is like Jordan Peele is actively speaking to the audience and breaking the fourth wall.  It is a very nice embellishment on a film that is filled with smart decisions.  Something that you should know about me is that I love a movie that will make me feel so awkward that I can barely stand to stay in my seat.  Get Out made me squirm in the best way possible.  It plays on stereotypes, and with the featured conversation topics that are chosen to be had between the people of different skin colors, it allows this movie to have a foot in the door of reality in what is very much a genre film.  The story itself is a mystery, and I do recommend knowing as little as possible walking into this.  It's also a horror movie where your protagonist does not make bone-headed decisions, which is something that is all too rare within the genre.  It's hilarious, it's intelligent, and it is rare that we get a movie that is this good in the first quarter of the year.",

In fact, \"Get Out's\"' best moments are the ones where it keeps you guessing and making you uncomfortable with its social observations. Once the mystery is solved about 3/4 of the way through, however, its legs fall out from under it #GetOutChallengeFail. If the film spent more of its beginning developing the compelling lead, Chris, the latter half of the journey could have had far more of an emotional resonance and not so much of an \"us v.s. them\" vibe.",

            "content": "Get Out review:\nTime to Get this review Out the way. So for those who do not know, Get Out is about a guy named Chris who is going to meet the parents of his girlfriend, Rose. This review is hard to do without spoiling the meaning of a lot of scenes, so I am going to mention a few. First off, almost every scene in this movie serves a purpose, especially the beginning scene where a African American man is getting captured and then you hear the song Stay Woke playing in the background. Like in our society, something bad happens to a African American and nobody talks about it, then when it is brought to the attention of authority figures, they laugh about it, as a way of symbolizing in our world of people ignoring these issues. Not going to go into the lyrics in the song Stay Woke, but pay attention to them and they will make sense as the movie progresses.\nMany people may think this film is racist or anti white, but that is not the case. This people shows passive racism in a way that if you remove people who are black or white with people of a different skin color that the same situation could potentially happen. For example, all because the dad in the movie said he would have voted for Obama for a third term does not mean he is not racist. There is also a scene where the girlfriend is drink white milk in a black straw with colored cereal, which shows the separation of the colors and the whites. Constantly asking the main character what sport he is good at or how his performance is just shows that those type of comments can make someone who is a minority in society feel uncomfortable. At the party scene, the main character is the only one wearing blue while everyone else is wearing red, representing societal power dominance. The fact the idea of color blindness was used in such a non-conventional way in a movie like this helped expand the parallels in this movie.\nThe performances in this movie are outstanding, especially since some people are playing a different character in the same body. All I can say without spoiling that aspect. Chris gave an outstanding performance and his character was written so well that he was not close to being portrayed as a \"black\" stereotype. The actor who played his friend was hilarious and helped ease some of that uneasy tension from the movie while not distracting from the films purpose. The only problem I had with the movie is that it did not explore of biases that exist for African Americans through the interactions at the party scene. They kinda did, but it felt rushed just to help increase tension. The small comments, objects in the back and foreground that represent the prejudice that still invades our society today shows how important and amazing this movie is. On the surface, this movie is a thriller, but if you break down the themes in the film then this movie can be viewed as a horror movie, due to how some people can experiences these awkward situations. Highly recommend this movie to those who have not scene it and I give this movie an A.\nFunny comment I heard someone say in the theater: eat my timbs",

A trigger with the ability to render a person powerless. Ok, there is some blood in the third act, but there's very little viscera. The R rating is mainly for language. As Get Out unfolds to its inevitable conclusion we the audience understand this environment from Chris' perspective, The final twist is the perfect cap to a tale that has toyed with race for the entire duration.

That is just not a genre I love - so there's that - but even if you do, it's not that overwhelmingly great. The premise is very silly - but then that's true of many (most?) horrors - but okay, many people like silly horrors ---> but it's the degree of unanimity that makes no sense to me.  It is getting a ton of credit for it's social commentary about racism. I have no idea what people are seeing. There are a few random observations about racism which are far from fresh that are only tangentially related to what happens. The lead actor is not good at all IMO and there is a really bad plot hole that falsely allows something critical to happen. I thought it might be a bit funny but no, not really.  4.4 out of 10",

It's a bummer that so many people give it poor reviews - almost always noting that it's a good film but they won't give it good marks because it's some secret liberal Obama plot agains the white man. The movie plays on the (well-founded?) fear of that some black people might have about white, rural America. Geez, how rude! I'm glad there are no movies in which white people's fears of inner-city black people play out. Remember Chevy Chase in \"Vacation\", where in one gag he leads his family off the beaten path and into the \"ghetto\", where he has to pull over to ask directions and hilarity ensues? (He's robbed of his money and hub caps). Remember \"Animal House\", where a bunch of white college boys take their ill-gotten dates to an all-black bar? The overwhelming discomfort and fear made me us all laugh our ___'s off. Those are just the ones that popped into my head immediately. Get over it white America - you'd be nervous about being dropped off in Compton in the middle of the night (perhaps rightfully so, depending on who you ran into) and that fear has been played out in movies of all genres for decades. An inner-city black guy might have underlying fears about being dropped off in all-white rural America (perhaps rightfully so, depending on who he ran into). It's no different - as with all satire, there is just enough truth to make it interesting.",

The main problem with this film lies in its use of over used, tired, an quick frankly predictable thrill and scary movie tropes which are littered over almost every single  film in these two genres. Oh the sound track cut out and now the film is mostly silent, here comes a jump scare. Oh no the main character suffers a traumatic experience, well guess what it may have just been a dream maybe.  What that? The main character has some emotional baggage from a family member dying? Its not like I've seen that a million times. I could handle heavy handed message of the film and I could stand how many shots were taken at white people throughout, but don't make a movie that supposed to some social commentary on a very specific topic without at least having an original and well written script. Jordan Peele  as a writer has the ability to write something better, and we should know this from projects like Key & Peele. Yet sadly this film falls just short of passable when it could have been something outstanding and truly unique. I am sorry but this movie really isn't worth the full ticket price would pay to see it. Fortunately I have a discount movie day at the theater in my town so I only had to pay $5 to see this film. on a scale of 1-10 I'd give Jordan Peele's \"Get Out\" a 7-7.5/10, worth viewing but not in theaters.",

Get Out is directed by Jordan Peele, which is surprising when you realize that he is most well known for the hilarious comedy sketch show Key and Peele. However, the thing that Key and Peele was best at was mixing comedy with different genres, and that's what makes Get Out so great. It mixes humor and horror until they essentially become one and the same. And it's brilliant. The movie will go from a genuinely humorous moment to a genuinely freaky moment at the drop of a hat and it doesn't feel the least bit jarring. The movie is also populated with great actors who are all on their A-Game, especially the guy who plays the main character's best friend. He was hilarious. Honestly, another thing I loved about the movie was the runtime. It gets in and gets out (pun definitely intended) managing to never overstay it's welcome. Aside from a couple moments in the first act that are obviously only meant to be easy scares for the audience as they don't really make sense upon further realizations in the movie, I really can't find any flaws with Get Out. The only way I wouldn't recommend this movie is if you're part of a relationship involving a white girl and a black guy, because that would be a really awkward viewing experience.",

            "content": "\"A mind is a terrible thing to waste.\"\n\nLet's talk about the best movie of 2017 for a little bit. No, seriously, this will be the number one movie of 2017 no doubt. It's already earned a number 1 spot on my top 10 list of 2017, and its only March. Jordan Peele is a genius. This movie is genius and it deserves all of the awards and praise.\n\nMost people are chalking this up as a movie about racism, but don't let that deter you from seeing it(if you're that kind of person that is). From the beginning of the movie right up until the final moments, I was sitting, quite literally, on the edge of my seat. It will be a movie that will not only entertain you, but make you think as well. It's got a lot of a Stepford Wives feel, and a little bit of an old school horror flick feel. So basically, it is awesome.\n\nLet's start out with a little bit of the story of the movie. Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose (Allison Williams) have been dating for a while and it's the point in time in their relationship where it's finally time to meet the parents. He's concerned that they don't know of the interracial relationship and she brings him comfort in letting him know they won't care, and that her dad loved Obama. On the drive down, we meet Rod (LilRel Howery). He's a good friend of Chris' and provides ALL of the comic relief in this movie, trust me. Comedic genius. The racism plot starts out very early in the film, as Chris and Rose are involved in a small car accident when a deer runs out in front of Rose as she's driving. The police officer on duty proceeds to try to see Chris' ID even though he wasn't driving, which Rose is NOT happy about.\n\nSoon enough, we meet Rose's parents, Missy and Dean. Missy (Catherine Keener) is automatically creepy to me, while Dean (Bradley Whitford) seems like a welcoming father. We meet the housekeepers, Georgina and Walter as well, both African-American's, which makes Chris uncomfortable, but he understands a little more when Dean informs him they're part of the family. They live with them and choose to work. Weird? Weird. And if it wasn't weird just for that simple fact, their actions are definitely weird. The last member of the clan that we meet is Jeremy, Rose's older, and very strange, brother. He makes it very clear he doesn't like Chris from very early on in the movie.\n\nWe learn that Missy is a therapist and that she can cure almost any ailment, including smoking which Chris has a problem with. On the first night of staying, Chris decides to go out for a smoke and meets Missy, who hypnotizes him, but he wakes up with hardly memory and chalks it up to a dream, but he also has no desire for a cigarette anymore. Rose assures him that she will talk to her mom.  Things can only go down hill from this point. The Armitage's throw a fancy party and everyone seems really interested in getting to know the guest of honor, Chris. Chris feels uncomfortable and rightfully so, all of the guests are asking him very racial questions, and even I felt a little uncomfortable at this point. That is until he meets another young African-American, who seems a little off. Upon taking a picture of him to send to Rod, the flash goes off and startles the young man who tries to attach Chris. In that moment Chris feels like he knows him.\n\nAnd this my friends, is where the important details I can't tell you come into play. I want to discuss the movie in its entirety, but I don't want to spoil a magnificent ending for anyone. I haven't been as excited about a movie, before and after seeing it, as I have this one in a really long time. The moments leading up the end will have you not wanting to blink, there's a slight twist which most people will see coming, but some may not. Either way, it was satisfying.\n\nLet's talk about how this was Jordan Peele's directing debut! I cannot believe we have not seen more from him before this. He's a creative genius, and now that I know he has four more movies in the works I cannot wait. I will be supporting him until the end of my life. Perhaps one of the best directed movies I have ever seen. I love the fact he teamed up with Jason Blum, as we all know is another one of my favorites. From the cinematography to the story to the actors he chose and the blunt focus on racism, it was all perfect. He wrote a story that people need to see, and one that will frighten you honestly. Hand claps for Peele! He deserves it, and if he doesn't get nominated and WIN some sort of award for this movie, we'll all know it's rigged.\n\nThe actors he chose for the characters couldn't have been better chosen. From Allison Williams as the perfect daughter, to Bradley Whitford as the caring father, to LilRel Howery as the comedic relief and awesome best friend, to our main character Daniel Kaluuya, it was all perfect. Guys, I'm seriously writing this review still reeling on this movie and I watched it Sunday!\n\nThe scene where Missy hypnotizes Chris made me the most uncomfortable. The \"sunken place\" that you'll see in the movie is a terrifying concept. It's basically a black hole of void, and to be stuck in a place like that, or even THINK you were in a place like that is honestly the most terrifying thought in the world. She makes him relive a tragic moment in his life and gets in his head, and I couldn't decide if I was traumatized for him or terrified. A mix of both emotions definitely.\n\nI'm telling you right now, this will be the movie I put at the top of any top 10 list I do for the 2017. Quote me on it now, this will be THE movie to compete with now, and maybe for years to come. Pay $10 to see this movie, pay $25 to see this movie. Whatever it is, do it. You need to see this movie, because everyone is going to be talking about it for a while now.\n\nhttps://lifeofanavidmoviegoer.wordpress.com",

My frustrations are largely with the brain swap reveal in the movie. It doesn't make sense that you can replace the brain in the host body and the victim can still be summoned with a camera flash. The fact that the grandparents are pretending to be servants makes no sense. They could have posed as family friends and it would have been far more believable. I think the film should have went along a different line. The mother should have been hypnotizing the victims and selling them off as brainwashed slaves. It would have been far more powerful and diabolical then a goofy brain trade bit.\n\nI also think the straight man/goofy friend bit got incredibly old by the end of the movie. Wouldn't recommend this film to others",

We should just assume that when you transfer one brain to another body that a mere flash of light will reverse the surgery....I don't think so. So much more could have been done with this film to make it grade A. It's pretty much the Skeleton Key with less suspense, intrigue, explanation, and development.

It had a couple of dumb jump scares and irrelevant scenes (like the man running randomly in the woods) but it totally provided tension and comedy. It was such a happy medium of being a satire and horror film. Peeled was able touch on a pretty heavy topic in racism and addressed it in a way without forcing it. Some of these things that seemed so out of the ordinary were things that people actually say to a different race and it was portrayed very well. The lead actor did a great job and I'm sure we will be seeing more of him and I also thought his added a comedic relief and always stole the show when he was on screen. I don't know if I really thought it was scary and if it held as much suspense as it wanted to but it was extremely entertaining and it is definitely worth the watch.",

Recently, I liked \"Green Room\", and \"Split\", but it continues to be a hard genre to break out with a truly original idea. Jordan Peele's \"Get Out\" felt like the universe had heard my prayers. A smart satire on social commentary with genuine humor, and yet a still bone chilling plot? How have we been so blessed? The balance of horror and comedy is weighted perfectly, with every release of laughter being used to reset the suspense, giving the audience the chance to build back up to paralyzing fear over and over again. All of the performances were pitch perfect (Alison Williams with the keys!), and I anticipate this is only the beginning of Daniel Kaluuya's rise.  I often complain to my friends that the biggest disservice of the horror/thriller genre is that by pigeonholing something as \"a scary movie\", you isolate a whole demographic of people who want to just go see a blockbuster on the weekends. Having Peele's name attached and released by Universal on the perfect weekend (only up against week 3 of Lego Batman) gave this layered story a chance to breathe and be appreciated for what it is. Creepy as all hell, and maybe a little too believable. 9.2/10",

I was progressively shocked (mostly because I am a 45 year old introverted white guy who hates news) and thrilled while the climatic ending!

            "content": "A brilliant horror movie. It's definitely one of its kind, due to the subject nature. As we all know from the previews, it's about an interracial couple who visits the girlfriends parents and a whole lot of awkward stuff happens. I would say this movie is a blend of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and Stepford Wives.\nThe genre of this film would be a comedy horror. I applaud the filmmakers for not making this a film that relies heavily on jump scares. Originally that was one the elements I thought was going to deter me from seeing this. However there are really no jump scares in the movie. Which is great because what I love about this film is that it understands that atmosphere is the key element in horror. Not cheap scares to make you twitch in your seat. The director did a great job at conjuring the atmosphere, you feel as if the characters are in a quiet, secluded area. Even the cliche \"loss of phone coverage\" is in the movie, however it works in the movie. We as the audience get a sense that we are removed from the normal world. That's due to the atmosphere and the characters obviously. \nNow to the characters. Jordan Peele is a genius for these characters. For generations blacks know of these type of people. And Peele did a great job in portraying them in this film. As a black man, I don't know how many times people told me they voted for Obama. Or how many times people have made allusions to stereotypes that are linked to my race. There's a term called positive stereotypes. These are perceptions that society grants over certain groups under the \"notion\" that it benefits said group. Examples would be Blacks are great athletes or Asians are great at math. While upfront it may seem like a compliment but when you look deeper a stereotype will always a stereotype. Therefore those who hold strong beliefs in that stereotype, only socially accepts those who uphold the stereotype. It also makes it hard for others within the group. Not all blacks are athletes and not all asians are good at math. Those individuals are likely to be shunned from society for not upholding the stereotypes. When you look at it negative or positive, all stereotypes are bad because you've relegated a race to a few traits. The characters in the dinner party scene have a creepy admiration for the main character Chris. They admire his physical attributes and try to segue each conversation into their admiration for his race. Even though I got a Rosemary's Baby vibe from how awkward the characters were portrayed, what's creepier is that these people exist. I love the fact that Peele did not display the characters as prejudice, Deep South whites. However they were displayed as upwardly mobile, liberal whites. Who support equality and the liberal agenda however they are so far removed from outside their peer group. Due to their position in society they don't really socialize with black people within their circle. However that doesn't make them racist, sure they admire African Americans but they took the time to actually get to know and understand. Growing up black, I was always told to be weary of those types who will smile at the front and stab in the back.\nThe comedy is funny, Chris's freind the TSA is hilarious. He portrays his character in a way that doesn't come off as annoying. The best scene with his character is at the precinct. There are also some funny scenes involving the family. When I mean funny, the humor is done in a satirical fashion.\nThere is a reason this film has such a high rotten tomato score. I know it sounds hacky but the film has never been told before in this style and released from a major studio. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, even if you're not a horror fan you will appreciate this movie. It's very reminiscent of a segment of the Twilight Zone. Congrats for Jordan Peele for putting together a brilliant movie that needs to be told. So for those who see this can stop telling me that they voted for Obama twice and would voted for him again if possible.",

The film overall was predictable, not scary, and used every stereotype in the book to hammer one message into your skull ... white people cannot be trusted or allied with ... ever!!  This is what so-called progressivism gets you, folks.",

Anyone who has been in a interracial relationship , particularly black people  who are middle-class or higher,  will see this for what it is. Does racism exist? Absolutely. But this kind of foolishness is something on a whole different level of nonsense. This is one of the most racially offensive movies I have ever seen. It is the equivalent of Birth of a Nation made from the opposite perspective. Anyone who considers this a film about being intellectually woke as black people are a bit sad. I went to see this film expecting to see smart satire. Instead all I saw was a bunch of tired and trite stereotypes that will marched out pretty early on in the film. Think of every possible mundane stereotype of interracial relationships that you've ever heard of if you're an adult. He left no stone unturned. Absolutely no originality. Every single frame was highly predictable for me. Now maybe that's because I am a film buff and highly evolved. But for me, this flick was very insulting. In contrast, while people did not like Django Unchained because of the language, the satire and the use of metaphors was brilliant. I expected that in this film. Absolutely no such thing.

There are so many cool and disturbing twists and turns that really got under my skin in the best way possible.

The character of Rod played by Lil Rel Howry is so funny. Hadn't laughed that hard at a character in a while. Peele is also obviously influenced by many classic horror films like Rosemary's Baby, and does some cool visual tributes to other films that horror fans will spot and like.

How anyone can even be around people who talk like that, you have to be a seriously sick person to spew nonsense like micro aggressions & the rest of the SJW crap. I'm sick to death listening to delusional people. \n\nI do have to laugh though, in two newspaper reviews they used the same phrase \"seemingly liberal parents\", as if liberals can't be bad people, it's laughable, all the bad people I've met in life were liberals.",

At just the right moments, the tension is broken by the movie's one super-funny character. I won't say more at the risk of ruining it for anyone. It's so good. I really recommend it with the warning that it does earn its R rating (mostly with language). To me, this is the best horror movie since 2016's \"Don't Breathe\" (though it's completely different).

En mi opini\u00f3n, el terror no solo son los Screamers, el buen terror te hace sentir incomodo, tenso y si es posible, miedo. El a\u00f1o pasado The Witch logr\u00f3 ser una de las mejores pel\u00edculas del a\u00f1o y una obra maestra del terror psicol\u00f3gico, jugando con el espectador con un lenguaje cinematogr\u00e1fico impecable, con una m\u00fasica precisa y una historia original con un giro de tuerca impresionante; precisamente esto mismo ocurre con \"Get Out\".\nEn \"Get Out\" o \"Huye\" no veremos brujas o demonios, en esta cinta el terror es provocado por un grupo de personas comunes y corrientes (Eso lo hace aun mas perturbador)\nLa historia es sobre una pareja interracial, ambos deciden pasar un fin de semana en la casa de los padres de la chica con el prop\u00f3sito de que los padres conozcan a la actual pareja de su hija. A pesar de ser una pel\u00edcula de suspenso (y de vez en cuando de comedia tambi\u00e9n) la historia toca temas como el racismo, cr\u00edtica la ignorancia que todav\u00eda existe en los americanos sobre este tema y de vez en cuando lanzan unas cuantas pedradas a Trump de la forma mas sutil posible. \nNo quiero hablar mas sobre la trama para no arruinarles la sorpresa, pero lo que si les puedo decir es que la pel\u00edcula logra generar tensi\u00f3n, a veces incomodidad, a veces repugnancia, y en ciertos momentos miedo. Desde que inicia hasta que termina, 104 minutos en donde vas a experimentar todo lo anteriormente mencionado. \nPuede que la historia llegue a ser un poco predecible en cierto momento de la pel\u00edcula, pero el giro de tuerca que nos presentan en el acto final es una locura total.",

This movie takes that idea basically but chose to go about telling it and doing it in a slightly different, dare I say racial way. And I guess the jokes on us/them because we (white people) now want to habitat and live in black peoples bodies which is utterly racist. All because granddad lost a track race he wants his family Ken to find  good working and gifted black people to help overcome their previous shortcomings in life (looking hard at you too Self/less) this movie was fun no doubt but the idea/twist was just dumb cause we've seen it in other places before, just in a slightly different way.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers. As much as I enjoyed this movie, I think the piling-on of the (white liberal) critics is almost as entertaining as the movie itself. There's something suspicious going on when a movie gets universal rave reviews, especially with as many plot holes as this one has. The critics derisively refer to the \"white liberals\" lampooned in the movie, as if they themselves are not among them. They're especially fixated on the Obama line, which probably wasn't meant to have as much import as they give it. (White people are racist if they say negative things about Obama, but also if they say positive things?)\n\nPeople, this is a quasi-campy horror/suspense movie that's also a mash-up of recent race-related events, which lightly riffs on awkward interracial moments. That's all. It's not a deep, profound statement on race relations in America no matter how desperately the critics want it to be.  And if it was intended to be, it does not successfully pull it off, imo. The main reason is that the underlying premise that's supposed to support the evildoing in the movie doesn't hold up. It never satisfactorily explains why the sinister white people are doing what they're doing only to blacks. Instead of say, any young, strong athletic person. The one attempt in the film to explain it was so lame that it made the whole racial gimmick fall apart for me. \n\nAt the same time, the racial element is necessary in order to convey the paranoia felt by the main character. The film wouldn't have worked if it was a white boy meeting the white parents. (By the way, a white person would also experience not-so-subtle hostility meeting the black parents. Black people are not necessarily more open-minded about interracial dating, something that's briefly referenced in the scene with the cellphone but curiously unmentioned by any critic.)\n\nGet Out is essentially The Skeleton Key with the races reversed, using medicine instead of black magic. The premise seems to be that these racist white \"liberals\" believe they're intellectually superior to blacks but that blacks are physically superior, so they put white brains inside black bodies in order to create some kind of perfect human. Supposedly they covet the physical and sexual prowess of black males. But how does that explain the black housekeeper, Georgina? Are black females also physically better? The plot device would make more sense if Rose were bringing home only star athletes, but she's not. She's bringing home random black guys (and one girl). \n\nThe premise would also make more sense if the evil whites were harvesting blacks to be their servants, but they're not. The two \"servants\" we see turn out not to be servants at all. In Stepford Wives, which Get Out borrows from, there's no question why the men did what they did. This film left me with all kinds of questions.\n\nThe point is enjoy the movie as a fun horror film, but take the racial stuff with a grain of salt and don't try to over-analyze it. The film itself didn't bother me as much as how critics and some audience members reacted to it. I made the mistake of seeing this with a mixed-race audience.  Some black audience members cheered a little too enthusiastically when the white family were being killed, and as much as I'd like to believe it was because the bad guys were getting what they deserved (because I was inwardly cheering too), it seemed to be because the WHITE people were getting killed. (Imagine white audiences cheering as a white character slaughtered blacks.) I felt mildly uneasy walking out of the theater, and not in the \"good\" way that an effective horror film should make you feel. My advice to white people is to try to see this movie with a \"non-diverse\" audience if possible, otherwise some of the reactions might piss you off.\n\nFinally, to address the argument that the film is ridiculing white-liberal hypocrisy and that \"white liberals\" are the target of its so-called social commentary. That falls flat, because the whites here are not really \"liberals,\" they're pseudo-liberals. They're sinister cultists masquerading as liberals, just like the \"servants\" are masquerading as servants. (Why is their son something out of Deliverance when the rest of them are upper-middle-class intellectuals?) It would have been nice if the film had included at least one good, redeeming white character, but it didn't. There's even a stereotypical racist white cop thrown in. So the \"anti-white\" accusations are not entirely off-base. Hence, three stars instead of five.",

Half of the Comedy Central comic duo of Key and Peele, Peele has been a comedian since college and is a veteran of The Second City improv troupe and MADtv. The product of an interracial marriage, much of Peele's comedy springs from his observations about race and racial divisions in the U.S., while he also uses his work as a form of social commentary on those issues. His talent and insight have earned him nominations for the Emmy Award and NAACP Image Award (multiple times each - including one Emmy win, an American Comedy Award and a Peabody Award for accomplishments in public media). Peele has also appeared in films (including 2016's \"Keanu\", with comedy partner Keegan-Michael Peele), television shows and internet videos. All of those experiences serve him well in \"Get Out\", a movie which has moments of comedy and carries implications for our racially divided modern world, but is actually more horror film than anything else.  \n\nChris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is a New York City photographer who is preparing to drive out to the country with his girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), in order to meet her parents for the first time. Chris is nervous about how Rose's parents will react to their daughter dating a black man and Chris' buddy, TSA agent Rod Williams (Lil Rel Howery), teases him over the phone about the situation. Rose reassures Chris that her parents are very liberal and open-minded. As Rose predicted, her father, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and her mother, Missy (Catherine Keener), welcome Chris with open arms.\n\nIt turns out that they are not racist, but they do make a number of racially insensitive remarks without realizing it and they employ two servants, both of whom are black. Walter (Marcus Henderson), the groundskeeper, and Georgina (Betty Gabriel), the maid, both act so politely that it seems phony to Chris, not to mention that they both speak very strangely. When Rose's brother, Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones), shows up for dinner, he is even rougher around the edges than his parents. Things get even more uncomfortable for Chris when an annual gathering at the Armitage home introduces Chris to a host of rich white people much like Rose's parents (except for a blind art dealer played by Stephen Root), while one older woman is married to a young black man (LaKeith Stanfield) who looks vaguely familiar to Chris, but who doesn't act anything like the black men that Chris knows from back in his native Brooklyn.\n\nBut it's not just the way everyone acts that makes Chris uncomfortable - it's also the things that are happening around him. A police officer whom they meet after hitting a deer on a country road treats Chris like he did something wrong, even though he wasn't driving at the time. Missy, who is a psychiatrist, voices her strong opposition to Chris smoking around her daughter and insists on hypnotizing Chris in order to help him break the habit, even after Chris turns down her offer. She also keeps prodding him to talk about a painful memory from his childhood. Chris talks to Rod on the phone about the strangeness of his weekend and then Chris starts finding his phone unplugged. It also turns out that Rose hasn't been entirely forthcoming about her dating history. I'd like to say more, but I won't because, as much as I've already written, there are still plenty of surprises for the audience to discover.\n\n\"Get Out\" is an inventive, insightful and very entertaining film. Although admittedly influenced by \"The Stepford Wives\", what happens in this movie and why it's happening is original and sheds fresh light on the subtler manifestations of racism in America, even from sympathetic and well-meaning people and groups. In fact, it's easy to see this movie as one mainly about racism, but generally, as a Movie Fan, I see it mainly as a well-crafted horror film. There's a certain creepiness about it that starts early, and then slowly, steadily ramps up throughout the film and its appropriately unexpected and shocking reveals. Some of the plot points strain scientific credulity, but that seems to matter little in what is basically a horror fantasy. The film is perfectly cast and terrifically acted. There's also some funny, effective and well-placed comic relief (from Howery's character). That's to be expected from someone like Jordan Peele, but who knew that he would be so good at horror? This movie feels like one of M. Night Shyamalan's better films, with a strong subtext of social commentary. For so effectively presenting these elements and perfectly balancing them, this film deserves the nearly perfect grade of \"A\".",

At first, Chris reads the family's overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he could have never imagined.\n\nIn complete honesty and with all due respect, I didn't expect that Jordan Peele would create such a smart and balanced film. That's nothing against him but a lot of actors, especially comedic actors, don't normally translate well to the directorial stage. When watching the initial trailers for this film, it looked interesting but it looked kind of ridiculous. I expected that it could be something good but then before the film was released, there was a lot of buzz surrounding it. When the film was finally released, I had to see what all the buzz was about. In fact, this became one of the smartest films I've seen in the early year.\n\nThe acting was phenomenal in this film. I first caught sight of Daniel Kaluuya in the TV series \"Black Mirror\" and I was really excited to see what he could do. In fact, he put up a hell of a performance. I can't wait to see what else this guy does because he encapsulated this character so well and he brought this powerful emotion to the table. Everyone else in the film did excellent jobs but you should see this film just based on his performance alone. \n\nIt's a creepy movie but it's nothing too scary. I actually think that this movie had a perfect blend of comedy, horror, suspense, and thrills. It had a great story and an interesting one at that, especially considering they did a good job tying together all the loose ends and questions. There are plenty of things to like about this film and its ability to hit multiple genres and hit them well will appeal to many audiences. \n\nThe writing was good and even though it felt like there was a purpose behind a lot of the racial messages behind the scenes, it still felt like some things were written in just for the sake of them being there. I think this movie does a great job symbolically and it clearly has a message, I just think they pushed the boundaries sometimes. Not everything felt purposeful. \n\nThe ending was fairly underwhelming in my opinion. The story had such a great ark to it but the ending felt kind of cliche and easy. They did such a great job of building this world and keeping you on the edge of your seat, but then it seemed to end in a stereotypical slasher type way. If anything, it left a lot unsaid and the final result of the movie was not very enticing. I felt like the movie built toward something that I can see in just about any movie, which is a shame considering how much I loved 90% of the film.\n\nIn the end, this movie has its problems for sure, but nothing that overshadows all the great things this film did.",

It moves along very slowly for at least the first 45 minutes. It is a different, off-beat kind of movie for sure. The main thing I resented about this movie was the political/social overtones in the movie. There were lines about Obama being the best president ever which were totally gratuitous.

Going through it all with 2 likable characters and discovering all the awkward moments, jump scares, intense scenes and moments of realization that makes the whole movie click. Well acted by everyone who played and when it comes to first directorial debuts, this by far outshines alot of other directors.  A definite must check out for just about anyone.",

            "content": "It's been almost a week since I saw it and I still can't stop talking about and recommending Get Out. It's a twisty dark cross between \"The Stepford Wives\" and \"Guess Who Is Coming To Dinner\" with some \"Rosemary's Baby\" thrown in for good cinematic measure. The film soars as both a truly creepy horror film and a glaringly accurate social commentary on racism in post-Obama America.\n\nThe plot is simple but terrifying. Orphaned black boy Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) has been dating white girl, Rose (Allison Williams) for five months. White girl Rose says, \"Hey, I want to take you home to meet my parents.\" As they are preparing for their trip to suburbia, Chris finds out that Rose has not told her parents (Catherine Keener, Brad Whitford) that he is black and thus, becomes nervous about meeting them. Once at her home, Rose's wannabe hip white parents try to prove to Chris that they don't have any racist tendencies by spouting stock lines like,\"I would have voted for Obama a third time.\" This is when the weirdness jumps off.  The white townsfolk seem overly glad to meet and impress Chris. And worse, something is not right with the few black folks that reside in Rose's little hamlet. In fact, the black folks are downright creepy in their off-ness. Fortunately, Chris keeps in constant contact with Rod, his skeptical TSA agent friend and updates him regularly on the strange goings on. Played by Milton \"Lil Rei\" Howery, Rod serves as the voice of every black audience member, that ever yelled at a horror movie screen. Some fellow and sister critics claimed the film loses steam in the third act. But I beg to differ. Get Out is frightful and creepy, funny and original for two hours and 10 blissful minutes!\n\nAs a horror movie Get Out is awesome and has some great jump out of your seat moments. But where the film is truly terrifying, is the close to the bone jabs it makes at the racism of white liberals in America. As black people, especially in the professional realm, we often find that the very people, who rail the most against perceived racial injustices, the same people marching and protesting against Trump, the same folks who voted for President Obama twice - are often the most racist people in this country. Because in trying to over compensate and not recognizing racists tendencies in themselves, they often make worse racist assumptions than the stereotypical hood wearing, confederate flag waving, sister fucking, backward Trump supporting, loud and proud racists, they disdain.  I have seen this from both the frontlines of activism and my years of working in Hollywood.  For example, Lena Dunham can't stand Trump. But at the same time, Dunham produced a tv show with no characters of color set in one of the most diverse cities and neighborhoods in the world. I would wager that there were few, if any, people of color in senior positions in her production office. This is racist. But Lena would never have realized it. This sort of unacknowledged racism is the American scab that Jordan Peele's film is picking at. It also explains why the Chris character isn't suspicious a lot sooner. Because we all, as black folks, experience and brush off so much subtle racism on a daily level, we can relate to this character just letting things slide, till it is truly too late. From white folks repeatedly telling me that I was \"so articulate\" when I was growing up to the strange woman, who touched my hair in Whole Foods last week then falsely claimed she saw a thread drop (yes, that actually happened!) , I have had every type of well-intentioned racist gesture. It is the norm, which is what makes Get Out so relatable and scary to its black audience. We, like Chris, would likely not see what was going on till it we were tied to a chair either!\n\nThere have been inaccurate claims of the film itself being racist. But Get Out! is one of the most accurate and innovative thesis on race in America ever committed to film. If the Truth hurts, viewers, perhaps it is time to look in the mirror and go within.",

            "content": "A White Woman Will Make a Brotha Want to 'GET OUT'!\n\n'Get Out' Movie Review\n\nGet Out is the new film brought to you by one-half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, Jordan Peele (Key & Peele, Keanu). It is a dark comedy and a horror film, that currently has a 99 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. So I can imagine that this film is really good. \n\n The movie focuses on a cute and young interracial couple. Chris, played by Daniel Kaluuya (Johnny English Reborn, Sicario) and his girlfriend Rose, played by Allison Williams (Peter Pan Live!) are at that stage where they have reached a milestone in their relationship and are getting ready for the first encounter. They're at the point in their relationship where Rose wants Chris to meet her parents. Were you expecting me to say they are having a different kind of encounter? Get your mind outta the gutter for a second. \n\nRose invites Chris to spend a weekend with her parents, in the parents' country getaway. Chris is worried because Rose hasn't told her parents that Chris is African - American. \n\n In the beginning, Chris believes the family is simply trying to break down the barriers of race, learn about him and his culture, and deal with the daughter's interracial relationship. As the weekend goes on, Chris realizes the other African - Americans in this country getaway are acting strange, brainwashed, and Chris is picking up sketchy vibes. Chris then learns some disturbing discoveries, discoveries that will lead him to a sunken place if he doesn't get out. \n\nDoesn't sound as bad as when I met a girl's parents not that long ago.\n\nIs Get Out Changing the Future of Horror Flicks?\n\nNow for years individuals have been saying the movie industry, especially Hollywood, has no more creativity, especially when it comes to horror films. We think we've seen it all in the horror genre. Slashers, ghost, demons possessing little girls, psychopaths, a chainsaw wielding maniac. At this point, I assume somewhere a Hollywood executive must be thinking to themselves, \"What haven't we've done?  (Light bulb) I know! A movie that explains what a large portion of black people are afraid of!\"\n\nI know the media makes it seem like many white people are scared of darker skin people. On the other hand, there is an equal amount of fear. Some darker skin people are actually afraid of Caucasians. \n\n Now I've never really been that kind of person...because of all those white women! Horniness will overcome fear. Yeah that's right, I've been up in that game before! I'm just kidding. But in all seriousness, I've never really been afraid of someone just because of the color of their skin. Unless I'm in the middle of a Neo - Nazi rally or a Klan meeting, I don't think I have much to be afraid of. \n\nBut for a lot of brothers and sisters out there, being the only person of color in a large group can be a little mysterious at times. A lot of things can come across your mind if you are put into that situation. Such as, \"What happened to everyone else? Am I though token? Are these people going to kill me?\" and that is exactly what goes through the mind of our main character Chris. \n\n\"So how long has this been going on - this ... thang?\" \n\nWhen Chris comes across Rose's parents, played by Bradley Whitford (Billy Madison, The Cabin in the Woods) and Catherine Keener (Capote, The 40-Year-Old Virgin) let's just say Rose's parents are acting a little off the wall, they're simply acting f*ckin' weird. \n\nThey have black housekeepers that seem to be lost in a trance, they seem a little inappropriate, and everything is just off. Rose's father keeps referring to Chris as \"My man.\" In addition, Rose's father keeps trying to prove he is accepting, and \"down\" with everything in Chris' culture. \n\n I can see where this movie might anger some people. Mainly because it deals with race, race issues, social issues, and other heavy topics. On the other hand, if you truly see this movie, and open your mind, you'll see that this movie is one of the best horror films/comedies in a really long time. I absolutely had a terrific time seeing this in theaters, and I think most people are loving this film right here.\n\nI'm just gonna dive into it, and give you the inside scoop. The movie does a remarkable job at building up tension. It starts off with an awkward encounter with Rose's parents. Then things really flip a switch. \n\nThe family decides to have a get together. At this get together you have other Caucasian people who are rich, wearing suits, riding white cars that all look the same, and Chris really does stand out like a sore thumb. Everyone there is really condescending towards Chris. \n\nOne woman in the film feels up on his arm and pec muscles, she even asks Rose \"Is it true? Is it (dramatic pause) better?\" I know it may seem like it is just an older woman fantasizing about him. On the other hand, it is everyone that is looking at Chris with an intense gaze. \n\n Also, at this point in the film, Chris comes across another African - American male named Andre \"Logan\" Hayworth played by LaKeith Stanfield (Snowden, Atlanta). Chris takes a picture of him, and Andre seems to break out of his trance. Andre freezes, has a nosebleed, and tears up a little. Suddenly, Andre starts freaking the hell out. He grabs Chris by the shoulders, shaking him, and yelling at Chris to get out. From that point on, the comedy beautifully transitions into a horror film.\n\nIt's bloody, scary, violent, has social commentary and it all works. The humor works, the horror works, and the thriller ride is a real journey. The movie is really a great mix up of different genres in one. Later on in the film, we are introduced again to Chris' best friend, Rod, played by Lil Rel Howery (The Carmichael Show).\n\nT.S. Motherf*ckin' A Saves the Day!\n\nRod truly is the comedy gold of this movie. Everything from his theory on Chris becoming a sex slave for these people to him believing he is the baddest T.S.A. officer on the block. \n\nIn a way, I feel like Rod was the character that can relate to the audience. Meaning Rod ask Chris what we would ask our friend if they were put in that situation. Such as, \"How are you not scared of this?\"\n\nI would love to see more of that actor in movies and television. He literally had the entire theater laughing. \n\nSpeaking of people in the theater, this audience was really passionate, having fun, and really enjoying the movie from start to finish. People in the theater were clapping, cheering, screaming, and this is the type of film that made an audience come to life. One young lady was sitting next to me, and she tapped me, a total stranger, and said to me with a mouth full of popcorn and shiny buttered lips, \"Damn this movie is hella good!\"\n\nAllison Williams and the rest of the cast did a great job, especially the parents. The parents for me were the scariest aspect of the movie. Williams shows some great acting range in this role. This isn't a spoiler, but I'll just say her character has a change of attitude that makes for an awesome twist. \n\n I know this is a small nitpick. But I wasn't a fan of how Chris comes to realize what the family is up to. You know how in many horror movies the killer may have left a door open by mistake, or the villain left his keys that go into his underground lair on the coffee table? Something like that happens in this film. I wasn't the biggest fan because the movie was so original until it did that.\n\nHence, the writing, the directing, and the direction is all very artistic, fun, relatable, and I had a great time with this movie. I actually can't wait to see this movie again. When it comes to a perfect blend of horror and comedy, this is what Kevin Smith's Tusk film should have been like. \nI know I had a little nitpick, but other than that I loved this movie. The comedy doesn't feel forced, it has great tension, an original story, has a message, and there is not one dull point in this movie. I believe Get Out earns a...\n\n4.5 Out of 5!\n\nSo if you haven't seen Get Out, what are you still doing reading this review? Get out and go see Get Out. \n\n\"So how long has this been going on - this ... thang?\" Long enough for me to close the book on this review for now and possibly get back up in the game of some pretty white women. I'll take the risk. Until next time, thank you all for reading, and or viewing, and I hope you all get out and have an amazing day as always. :)\n\nGet Out Movie Review Written by Nile Fortner",

The change resulted in cookie cutter production and predictable outcomes.  Get Out does a great job differentiating itself from the pack by creating a certain demeanor to it.  First and foremost a horror movie needs to have a grounded scenario. If we don't fully believe the situation the movie won't resonate with us. If you don't believe in ghost a paranormal movie will not have a lasting impression on you. Get Out uses it's plot to develop its characters, everything seems to move seamlessly from one scene to the next. One moment you are intrigued the next you are hit by intense form of guttural fear.  A fear that resonates to humans, a fear because we know the human race is capable of such horror. Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams deserve all of the praise they are getting but Lilrel Howery stole the show by delivering perfectly placed comedic relief . Some issues are overplayed and the so called twist  doesn't blindside you if you have been paying attention but the few faults are overshadowed by the great strides Get Out made for the genre.",

It was outstanding! From the directing, to the visuals, to how in depth the actors were. \n\nWhat I understand from the story is that, it is a direct reflection of American and world wide even obsessions with African people. African people are scientifically the STRONGEST, FASTEST, and they don't push this one, but are the most INTELECTUAL. As you can see, for some odd reason, the Europeans are complete opposites & maybe that is why they are so obsessed with African skin, strength, body built. So obsessed they meditate on it, in a sick way because they wish they could have the human traits of an African person. When people wish to be something else, they become jealous. Hate forms. Now there comes the mind control. \nThe fact that Africans were slaves through the the entire Carribbean, & North America, & Europe, etc. People may or may not realize this, but they were obviously brain washed. Just like they were in the movie. They were sunk. \nWhen Europeans brought the Africans to other continentsites, they stripped them of theiron heritage. Beat them if they spoke in their own language. Raped them because they couldn't resist the curves a woman should naturally have. They named them after themselves, Johnson, Smith, Jones, McDonald. Their beliefs were the same, believing in the same religion etc.\n JUST LIKE THEY DID IN THE MOVIE. In the movie, only the Africans subconscious will be in tact. While the rest of their brain was thrown away, they had a dead or almost dying persons brain living in their strong body. The African people smile at the masters, even though subconsciously they don't want to. But the belief in them is so deep, they don't know anything else. \nAnother interesting part of the movie was that at the end , the maid and the outside worker ended up killing themselves. And it's because they were being tortured , having someone else's brain and not their own. They weren't themselves, they didn't know themselves. And that's how it is today. African people who live in america, their african american... don't know themselves. They know what the media portrays them to be. Which are only fuck ups. That's why there's truly no care in the world if they kill one another. Because they're lost. No true direction. And it's sick that Europeans truly meditated on getting the strongest race to be mentally weak. That's why there's good and evil. Mind control is the most evil... that is why when the deer was killed in the beginning of the movie , the father stated how happy he was that the deers are getting killed because they are a metaphor for African people. He was happy because if they don't get killed then they will become superior and\n take over. PERIOD. that's why in France they kill numerous African people, and all around the world. It's sad.\nMovie was phenomenal.",

The horror is so deeply terrifying because it is 100% realistic that terrible people, driven by generations of hate, could be guilty of what you see unravel in this film. Even as the plot twists into something more surreal the truth in it all never disappears. This movie will stay with you and it should. \n\nNo matter who you are, there are scenes in this film that will reach you and I am glad. Your connection to the main character, Chris, will drag you through his experiences and honest reactions, forcing you to see the dangers of implicit and explicit racism through his eyes. Nothing he goes through is fair or deserved and you cannot deny it. \n\nThe film follows classic horror tropes, from the opening scene (think Scream from a new, but familiar perspective) to the final moment (where your stomach will drop to the floor). All while conjuring disturbing images from history in a flawless, artful way. Every scene, gesture, and movement is purposeful. \n\nPay close attention to the dialogue, look for clues in the way characters move, and you still won't catch on.. until it's too late. You will learn something and you will go on a wild ride. Your ignorance cannot protect you from writing and directing like this. Congratulations and bravo, Peele.",

At first Chris is a little nervous about meeting his white girlfriend's family, but Rose assures him that her family doesn't care about his skin color. When he first arrives at their estate, things seems to be running smoothly and better than he expected, but after having an odd encounter with Rose's mother, things take a turn for the worse. \n\nThis satirical thriller will be sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. The storyline is genius and relevant, while the dialogue is witty and eerie. The film seems to be more of a comedy than a horror, but that's what makes it so scary. \"Get Out\" has an excellent way of making the viewer feel uncomfortable about societies cultural appropriation. The cinematography is clean, sharp, and satisfying. The film's score is definitely one of my favorites. American composer, Michael Abels, is what holds the film together the whole way through. Included in the score, there's some blues, folk, rap, and traditional African chant. The cast was great and genuinely captured the films flow. The relationship between Chris and his best friend Rod was perfect and refreshing-they had the audience cheering from beginning to end.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the film, but it was way too predictable for me. Twenty minutes in, I already knew exactly what was going to happen and how it was going to end. I only wish that they kept the concept more on the subtle side and harder to predict. Nothing makes me love a film more than its twists and turns, but unfortunately, \"Get Out\" didn't have any of that. Aside from its predictability, I loved everything else about it. It seems to be a modern-day version of \"The Skeleton Key\" meshed with the satire from \"The Visit\". \n\nThis is 100% a must watch. \n\n8/10",

The comic relief is what probably made me feel that it was not horror enough. I can agree that this movie is nothing like you would ever see before, very cleverly put together and contained classic jump scenes along with chill-binding sound quality. I would more or less compare GET OUT to the movie SPLIT where they equalize as psychotic thrillers with elements of mystery. When watching it I was bracing myself for some really messed up horror scenes, but nothing in there really made me feel I should cover my eyes or feel shivers of fear. In the end I liked the movie but really had me question, did I really? I did feel paranoid after watching, but not scary enough that you won't be able to sleep for a few nights or so. A really great movie, just not a horror film. Sorry, not sorry.",

A great movies that deals with rarely explored themes while having scary parts.\n\nRace is unsurprisingly great at building tension. Horror movies don't just jump into the action, they are suppose to prime the audience with moments of uneasiness and discomfort until the actual horror happens. This movie will most definitely make you feel uneasy.\n\nI should also suggest that you skip the trailer if you haven't seen it already as it reveals a lot of the best scenes.\n\nWith my biases exposed, here is what I thought.\n\nLead actor Daniel Kaluuya is stellar, a perfect stand in for the audience  and his discomfort is palpable.\n\nThe direction and cinematography always kept me interested and everything had meaning. This included moments inside the protagonists head, symbolic imagery and lots more.\n\nThe only thing I wasn't completely onboard with was the reveal of the antagonist's motivations. I felt it wasn't 100% clear and the ending's execution didn't benefit from the information we were given.\n\nThen again, I don't know how it could have ended differently.

The irony (that I am certain Peele intended) is that the speaker of that line would have no clue what seeing through those eyes would really mean. Peele's story is excellent and his direction sure and steady. Though the ending was probably a bit flat, I see  a bright future for him in Hollywood.

It's a magnificent amalgamation of horror, comedy, and thriller, with a series of twists and turns that keep you invested the entire time, all in a very absurd Key and Peele kind of way. Best of all, everything makes sense in hindsight: thinking back on the film lets you fit all the tiniest of details together like puzzle pieces without any major holes, and plenty of really well-handled symbolism to boot. Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams are both standouts as far as performances go, and Peele has really solidified himself as a true talent to keep an eye on behind the camera.",

He brings an ingenuity and a grace to his direction, giving us a very well-rounded movie. We have fantastic moments of horror, which were terrifying. We have brilliant moments of comedy, which were hysterical. We have excellent moments of political commentary, which were thought-provoking. Peele is able to pack so much into one film, and is able to balance it all with perfectly measured ratios, as if he's been doing this for years. Not every director could go from a moment of pure horror to a moment of pure comedy in a second, and Peele is able to do this without it feeling forced. He was also able to build incredible tension and atmosphere, which is not something a lot of horror movies do these days. They just go from jump scare to jump scare, but Peele was able to craft this incredibly tense atmosphere that allowed the elements of horror to breathe naturally...\n\nYou can read our full review here: http://www.themovieparadise.com/2017/02/get-out-spoiler-free-review-jordan-peele.html",

The entire first hour is the main character Chris slowly realizing the people he is meeting are not what they seem. When the twist is revealed, this is when the movie picks up steam, which leads to a third act that is all kinds of crazy. The horror/suspense genre has been struggling as of late. GET OUT may not be original in what it is showing, but the way it is directed, written, and acted make this a fresh entry into a genre that is in need of some new energy. \n\nGrade: A-",

Although the conflict and climax isn't delved into in a very detailed manner and feels very brief, it manages to hold the interest of the audience and remain entertaining. The cinematography emits a nice atmosphere for the film, especially starting with an amazing beginning scene with good camera use and score choice that sets the tone for the rest of the film.

This movie has opened my eyes to so many questions and thoughts that I've literally have been here thinking like \"Damn that movie was deep man!\" For many, the message may not be clear and also for many, you might not have caught all the messages. I'm lost for words at the work that Jordan Peele put into this wonderful movie. Already selling over $33.4 Million in the box office just over the weekedn release and rating at 99% rotten tomato!

            "content": "I'm not really sure what the hubbub is all about. The film has very good acting, great visual style, and an interesting concept, but it just didn't hit the nail on the head.  The story was very sloppy, the pacing was awful, a lot of the things in it have already been done(hot fuzz, beyond the black rainbow, under the skin, the stepford wives), and it treated it's audience like morons.  ****SPOILERS*****  The scene with the red box that had all of the pictures in it was stupid.  If that was going to be in the film it could've been placed somewhere way less convenient.  It felt more like a plot device than a twist.  The pseudo science of the twist at the very end was totally ridiculous and unexplained.  I have a feeling that it could've been better if they were just being used as slaves/accessories rather than a failed attempt at re-animator logic, and the scene with the television while beautifully shot has already been done in a better fashion in Beyond The Black Rainbow. Another gripe I have is when characters are alone in a film and they talk to themselves stating everything they're doing, instead of just doing it, which this film had a lot of.  They also wasted precious time showing flashbacks to state the obvious to the audience, instead of just allowing the film more time to unfold, for the viewer to discover.  Lastly, what the hell was with the picture of him behind them in the auction.  Was that really necessary.  The bingo cards made the scene seem very coy, but that totally ruined it.  If he had walked in during that moment it would've ruined the entire subtlety.  Again, with that being said, the film had genuinely good moments, but tripped over itself far too many times to deserve the kind of reviews it's getting IMO.  I'm happy people are finding movies they enjoy though.",

He explore racism in a way that people now a days could relate. The story is easy to follow, as a interracial couple go to meet with their family and starts there an unexpected horror-thriller. \n\nThey way this movie was shot is fro the POV (point of view) of this main character Chris from Sicario's Daniel Kaluuya, showcasing the horrifying story of the partner's family until it get's real DARK. \n\nNo spoilers, I don't want o give away to much but at the same time express my feelings upon this movie and those which I'm about to review. 'Get Out' is surprising, humorous, and most importantly simple, a little problem about some scenes that try too hard to be scary but ended up not really and that's it. I like the way Jordan Peele direction and definitely will like to see more from him. \n\nA recommended movie to watch at the end of This month and the beginning of another. I'm gonna give 'Get Out' a rating of 8/10. Thank you for reading, it's my first public movie review, be sure to look forward to review more movies to you all.",

The entire cast does a great job, and Jordan Peele almost flawlessly transitions from scenes that are very uncomfortable to others that are really funny. I can say I enjoyed Get Out, although I wouldn't say it's as good as some people will have you believe, the movie dragged a bit in the awkward area right before the 3rd act, and some scenes were a bit over the top with the uncomfortable level and extreme racism. I did really enjoy the little twist at the end and I dug the ending quite a bit. I would recommend this film, and this may even be a future blu ray purchase",

            "content": "I was watching the Oscars last night with a group of people as I do every year. One of the women there, a white woman, couldn't stop talking about how horrible Halle Berry's hair was. It bothered me and became increasingly difficult for me to let it go as the night wore on. Sitting here a day later after the smoke has cleared, I can't help but wonder how differently my reaction would have been to that comment if I too was white. Or better yet, if the woman was black.\n\nTo those of you that think we live in this melting pot of a society where every race and sex thinks exactly the same way, I have a secret to tell you: You're delusional. Get Out puts that myth to bed choosing rather to tackle this concept head on in a way that's extremely creative in scope. The film isn't just about a black man getting introduced to his white girlfriend's family only to find they are secretly enslaving black people, although it is that too. It's more, layers more. What you see on the surface and the subtext make this an important film for our current generation.\n\nRotten Tomatoes lists the movie as both comedy and horror which I think is a fair assessment. Director/Writer Jordan Peele walks the tightrope seamlessly between funny and suspenseful, much like Shyamalan did in Split. The film's realness is what makes it hilarious and scary at the same time. It's a realistic portrayal of what someone might do when put in these uncomfortable situations. Main character Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) can sense there's something wrong with this situation and, deep down, he knows he's right. He just doesn't want to be. He ignores how strangely the other black people in the community act and turns a blind ear when his girlfriend's father mentions voting for Obama for a third term as he tries to relate. He can tell by their actions and words that something is going on, but he's a guest and doesn't want to be the conspiracy theorist. \n\nSome of the most uncomfortable moments come during a community gathering where people in the neighborhood are meeting Chris for the first time. One woman defies boundaries and feels Chris' biceps, not in an endearing way but rather in the same way one might inspect an animal. Another man remarks on Chris' predisposition to being stronger because of his genetic makeup. I imagine that Chris has probably heard about these type of people before but never experienced it in such close proximity, and all at once for that matter. It has to be overwhelming and unsettling for him and Daniel does an excellent job of expressing those sentiments.\n\nThe social commentary doesn't fall flat and it makes you put on your thinking cap. It plays with your mind as you start to look for little subtext, which is not unusual in real life either. When the father tells Chris not to go down in the basement because there's black mold, I'm thinking, \"Why does it have to be black mold? All mold is dangerous!\" Was it meant to be racist? I don't know. Does it matter? Another great question.\n\nMy only gripe was that the resolution came extremely quick, almost jarring to a certain extent. It doesn't destroy an otherwise great movie however. It's a movie that ultimately says, \"You ARE different. And that's ok.\" We aren't meant to think the same things or act the same way. At the end of the day, coexistence and tolerance will help us unify.\n\nI consider Get Out a must-see. I give it a 95.\n\nP,S.--She was right, by the way. Halle Berry's hair was atrocious. I'll never tell her, though.",

The nuances of a story based on interracial relationships not making race more than it is demonstrates the talent of Jordan Peel. But if there is one critique I have is the secondary story of the lead actors childhood story.

            "content": "While the dialogue about racism in America needed to be re-opened in the post Obama era, 'Get Out' was one of the worst ways that this cultural revelation could have occurred. \n\nFirstly, the story was wholly reminiscent of every terrible straight to dvd horror movie to date. It was for the most part predictable, it was incredibly uninspired, and it relied entirely on the fact that it was attempting to address race relations to bring the movie any semblance of artistic merit. A threshold that the film still managed to not reach. Essentially, the film culminated in an excruciatingly awkward experience. It was a comedy that was not a comedy, it was a horror that was not a horror. \n\nBad movies get produced all of the time, however, and many of those movies get better reviews than they should in this artistic desert we reside in. But the reason I am prompted to respond to this movie, an action to which I have never lowered myself before, is the way that it addressed the issue of modern racism, and the audience that the film was directed towards. \n\nRich white neighborhoods exist. Rich white bigots exist. But a fact that many people in the modern era forget is that negative race relations go both ways. This movie painted rich intelligent white people as innately racist, which might be true in many cases. But there was also prevalent signs of racial tension in the reservations the lead character had about going into the suburbs. There was a fear present that in most cases is unwarranted. 'Get Out's suggestion that the people in those communities want to use and control black people failed to recognize the true culprits of racism. \n\nThe audience that loved the film was the target of the films supposed satire. The suggestion was that normal white people encourage racism through everyday comments and behavior. \n\nWhy would you criticize people who are doing everything in their power to help end racism? People who are themselves probably as far from racist as a person can be. Yes liberal racism is annoying, but it does not lead to greater racist tendencies in the public. Those were buried within society far before the term \"liberal elite\" was even thought of. The fact is that racism is truly the lowest it has ever been. Sure the result was that the fringe of society reacted and got a lying bigot elected, but \"ethnic minorities\" are safer and better off then they ever were before. \n\nNo the problem is not gone. However, you should not satirize your allies in the fight for equality. You should not make fun of a group of people who desperately wishes that true equality was an actuality. 'Get Out' is the result of a misguided script, misguided premise, and a ridiculous quarrel among friends. \n\nIt was also a terrible movie.",

It has incredible social critiques, and although they aren't subtle they seamlessly weave themselves into the already refreshingly original plot. One moment I would very frightened, and the very next scene I could be gut-busting laughing without it feeling forced. The acting by every single character was top notch, and each one was extremely unique in their own way, particularly our lead character played by Daniel Kaluuya. Yes, there are cliche'd jump-scares and other commonly seen horror tropes but it never becomes tired, with plenty of things to discover about our characters. Might I add, this film is exceptionally shot, even beginning with a long take which is a rarity for a film like this. Jordan Peele delivers an outstanding debut feature and introduced many delightful and unexpected twists and turns throughout the entire runtime. I was constantly entertained during even the most wordy scenes, and actually really enjoyed the ending, which does go a little fast, however. If this movie was only 15-20 minutes longer the third act could've been more exciting and horrifying for the audience. But aside from that this movie gives new life to the horror genre while also commenting on many controversial topics in today's society. 9.5/10",

I am sure he was trying to capitalize on the current racial tensions in this country and maybe state something like \"the white people you think you are close with or think have your best interests at heart, really dont\", but its confusing and not well done.

All of the actors do a great job but Allison Williams did a terrific job of combining sex appeal and psychopath. This is a great movie and don't be scared off (see what I did there?) keep you from seeing it. I'm going again this week I think.",

Instead with this one you get plenty of nuance and excellent camera work.  Jordan Peele of Key and Peele fame directs this thing and makes plenty of statements about race relations and appearances.  More importantly, he makes a good film that I would say isn't over the top scary, but has plenty of suspense.  He also takes a cool premise and flips it on it's head.  Most of the actors here are of the not well known variety, but they all buy into the notion of making a film with humor, suspense and some good scares.  This is one to check out for sure.",

It just looked so cheesy and dumb. But this is one of the smartest, most ambitious movies I've ever seen, maybe next to The Lobster. Almost everything about this film is perfect except the sometimes inconsistent soundtrack and how the film cuts out a few shots we saw in the trailer out of the movie. And the music sometimes drowns out what the characters were saying. Another problem is that there were a lot of unnecessary jumpscares. There were some that the main character didn't even see and the movie would just play a loud noise. Other than that, this movie was flawless. It was painfully funny. It is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Which in itself is funny because this is a horror movie. And it is horrifying. It is creepy suspenseful, eerie, and, one again, smart. The acting was really terrific in this movie. Daniel Kaluuya gives an Oscar worthy performance. If I rated movies based on how much I liked them, I would give Get Out a 10. But since I rate them on how good they are, I'm going to give Get Out an 8/10.",

The only character of any interest, or that you'll feel any (positive) affection for is a secondary one.

There could have been some depth put into Allison Williams, and it felt like Catherine Keener offered glimpses of a fascinating character that never went anywhere.  Caleb Landry Jones shows the most believable display of emotions, and there's a sense of an external backstory, but he's just used to get angry and hit stuff. None of the characters were much more than one-dimensional entities, and not too far into the movie you hope that they all just disappear or get killed. This movie is a formulaic, trope-filled (although only one jump scare) mess that seems to be trying to milk issues of contemporary \"race relations\" with a touch of Twin Peaks or a lesser X-Files episode. Myself and my companion were both bored and sleepy, and we both thought it sucked.

It manages to have the same creepy, unnerving dread of classic horror/thrillers you (and obviously Peele himself) grew up loving while still feeling fresh and particularly relevant today. This is not just your standard fare. This movie actually has something to say.\nIt's successful not just because it's wonderfully crafted, but also because of the sometimes subtle, yet biting and wholely relevant social commentary which runs throughout the film. This manner in which this is presented serves to bond the audience to its lead character and allows us a perspective, while immediately engaging, most genre films would shy away from.\nPeele's choice of his protagonist and the perspective he's allowing us in on is not the only reason this works. The film is exceptionally well cast and features some of the finest acting I've seen in years. In particular, Daniel Kaluuya, who's work in the lead role as Chris, is bound to get him some serious looks. Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener as the parents have never been better, and Betty Gabriel turns in a supremely creepy performance as Georgina. I could list every cast member here as they all had their moments and there were no flat, throwaway characters. Everything served the story.\nOne of the reasons this film was so satisfying was the work of Chris's best friend played by Lil Rel Howery. Not only did he provide much needed comic relief throughout a tense and taught thriller, but very much served as the voice of the audience. He stole every scene he was in.\nTo sum up, this is a beautifully crafted movie and it's hard to believe it's Peele's directorial debut. I will watch this again and again and can't wait to see what he does next. Go see it!",

The film is pure gold. (sic)\n\nIts a stunningly well made psychological horror with race as the emotional hook. I'm concerned that it's effectiveness with some people is due to a lot of very real racial hatred though.\na decent number of people in my theater were really \"getting off\" on the ending, yelling \"get that white bitch\"... I kid you not. Seeing the naked emotion in the room around me made me avoid eye contact with anyone after I left the film.\n\nwhat I think a lot of people won't get about the film is that the villains weren't anything like what the media is saying about Trump supporters or the Alt right, or any accurate portrayal of what the villain-du-jour is this month. The villains play on acting like your friend, they act progressive, voting for Obama, etc. But you're only worth to them whatever \"purpose\" they ascribe to you. You have to vote their way to be authentic, etc. it's all backwards... it's so backwards and I doubt a single critic will even notice.\n\nit's a REALLY well made film, and the symbolism is powerful, but I do fear, at least a little, that someone too obsessed with the election, maybe someone too high, or too mentally ill, will take the film a little too much to heart. it shocked me that my audience was so into the brutal violence in the film.",

I saw the film and it had the crowd laughing, not at the jokes which were intended, but at points which seemed like they were supposed to add tension. The film failed to effectively use and incorporate audio affects, using out dated sound effects that no one took seriously and did not take advantage of silence. I understand there was suppose to be humor but that is not what the trailer played the film up to be. It wasn't direct enough to be funny and was not serious enough to be scary. camera angles were off, scenes seemed artificial at times. The audio was ridiculously loud for the jump scares. Jump scare is a very low quality scare. The film did not manage to bring the atmosphere to life like it did in the trailer. though the weaknesses and strengths of the protagonists and antagonists were very coherent, the explanation for what was happening was clear.

The dialogue is lazy improv and there is no comedy. There are many attempts but they all involve cursing. To even attempt at comedy with the racial undertones in this film, it is disrespectful and immature. The jokes are not the kind you'd hear in When Harry Met Sally or even Rat Race.There's no great timing or great setups or reactions. It's just middle school humor. As for the scare-factor-this is not The Exorcist, the Ring , The Grudge or The Sixth Sense. But of course there are plenty of moments where the sound effect of someone suddenly appearing on screen is supposed to be scary. There is so much manipulation in this film-I cannot believe it's described so positively. The only good parts are Katherine Keener and Bradley Whitford. It's too bad really, because the plot is interesting were it written and directed better. I just kept sinking in my chair thinking-everyone is deluded.

It's a solid job in a debut, bolstered by a great cast. A wonky premise is pretty fun and bonkers if you forgive some jumps in logic.

            "content": "Biting, satirical horror is a unique blend, but Get Out delivers in spades when coming up with a sharp satire of black endangerment in an otherwise normal get together at a family home. Daniel Kaluuya delivers a star making performance and is nuanced throughout. Allison Williams treads tricky territory in a role that is calibrated to be perceived as one thing but is another in the end. Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford are suitably unsettling. Get Out is paced perfectly refusing to give away its hand too early but instead unfolds with a slow-burning intensity that reaches max suspense in the bonkers finale. If there are minor errors they are in the films unwillingness to go full out horror or comedy, instead teetering in a middle ground that feels like it could be explored to even more absurdity. Jordan Peele directs with a sure hand and his graceful camera work is heightened by the house's many twists and hallways. Get Out is the first must-see film of 2017. Rating: 83",

            "content": "Get Out was written and directed by Jordan Peele of the comedy group Key & Peele and stars Daniel Kaluuya as Chris, a young man who is joining his white girlfriend on a trip to her parents' home. Being black, Chris is nervous about whether or not Rose's (Allison Williams) family will accept him or be judgmental of his race. Chris notices upon arrival that something is off about the whole situation.\n\nI don't want to discuss anything else about the plot because I don't want to spoil it, but this is a great movie. Jordan Peele's script is magnificent, always giving subtle hints about what's going to happen next, peeling layers away from the mystery until the big reveal leading into the third act. Kaluuya gives a great performance in the leading role, and he is a very easy protagonist to cheer for. Catherine Keener also delivers as Rose's mother, a psychiatrist. My favorite character, though, was Lil Rel Williams as Chris' friend, Rod. Rod delivered much-needed and well-timed comedic relief and stole every scene he appeared in.\n\nMy one complaint about this movie is how the climactic scene came to an end. Again, I can't describe it without giving anything away, but I just wanted a more emotional finale than the one portrayed. That being said, it was still a solid ending.\n\nGet Out kicks off Peele's status as a director with a bang. The tension is high, the pacing is perfect, and the racial themes are clear and important. Go see this movie before somebody spoils it!\n\nFinal grade: B+\n\n-Ben",

This movie was a pure and unabridged liberal propaganda to make white people feel guilty for inherently being white. To start off, the main white character mutters, \"I would have voted for Obama 3rd time\", which was also quoted by the daughter at the very beginning of the movie. \n\nThe main story goes like this: a beautiful white girl lures black men into her home on the pretense of a serious relationship. The family alludes how superior black peoples bodies are. Then the black men get their bodies snatched to house white family members brains. The moral of the story: the rich white folks will brain wash you without you even knowing it. So fight back! How much  divisive can this be? At this time of racial tension, we don't need this type of \"brain washing\" and intentional attempt to divide people.\n\nJust to be clear, I am not white. But it really doesn't matter. Don't be lured into their attempts to make you feel like what they want you to feel. \n\nThis IS the brain washing in its core. I hope you are intelligent enough not to fall for it!!!",

Allison Williams is also excellent as Rose, balancing a tricky part where your not sure what her motivations are till the very end, and LilRel Howery brings some much needed humor as Chris's friend, Rod.  Behind the camera, writer/director Jordan Peele makes a remarkable directorial debut, using racism to set the creepy atmosphere of the Armitage house, but this time from a white liberal take, as most of the guests compliment Chris on his black heritage but in a very insulting way, from asking about his sexual prowess to saying they would have voted for Obama a third time.  All this leads to a surprising third act twist that you will not see coming, though thinking back on it make complete sense.  Peele is also well-versed in horror tropes and knows how to play on your expectations (the fact black people infamously don't last long in horror movies is subtly referenced) while keeping in his trademark humor at just the right time (Rod as a character is almost Shakespearian in his timing).

Thank you for making me laugh, cry and then scare me too my soul! Thank you Peele for making a new kind of movie that can open people's minds! This movie actually has A WAY DEEPER MESSAGE ! I wish some of these critics would understand. The fact that the 90% of the ones that are calling this movie \"garbage\" are the ones who continue in their review to call the minority \"colored people, niggas, and negros\" and \"black lives matters activists\" \"libturds\" it is 2017 let me remind you... I just can't believe that some people think that these titles are okay to say IN 2017!!!!!!!! Get a grip and throw away your white privilege. You would be acting that way (ignorant) if you 1. Have EVER been racial profiled and felt how deep those words cut 2. Had a soul 3. Had any common sense or 4. Knew anything about HISTORY OOOORRRR what's gone on in even the last ten years. Of course everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But how can you this movie is \"racist\" \"white-shaming\" or \"political garbage\" when Peele based this movie off of FACTS!!!! HISTORY!!! And things going on in America RIGHT NOW!!! The ignorant people that gave this movie 1/2 a star or \"not interested\" should have went into the movie NOT looking for a good thrill in the first 5 mins, NOT a middle or a good ending. They should have looked deeper and kept their eyes and ears open to see what was really going on. Saddens me that some people are so close minded and only want to speak ignorance. No one can fix stupid. \n\nTRULY I have never left a movie so determined to make a difference in my community. I have never laughed so hard or been so scared. EVER. This was a BRILLIANT piece of art and I Thank him for brining this to us especially at the end of black history month. A++ Jordan Peele",

            "content": "For years, I have enjoyed the genius of both Keegan Michael Key and Jordan Peele, who brought their impeccable chemistry and comedic timing from their days as performers on Mad TV to their acclaimed Comedy Central sketch show Key and Peele. Part of the appeal of the series was their keen and hilarious views towards race relations and ethnic stereotypes, which are reflected in their skits as well as their unpredictable outcomes. So when I heard that Peele's directorial debut would be a horror film featuring those same societal topics, I was a little hooked and by surprised he delivered a surprisingly effective thriller-cum-social satire that follows an interracial couple, African American Chris and Caucasian Rose, on their way to Rose's family home in the suburbs to meet her folks, unaware that their daughter's boyfriend is Black. Awkward at first, Chris hits it off with them and everything is copasetic, until out hero witnesses strange behavior brewing from the housekeepers and the Rose's parents themselves over the weekend and he slowly unravels a very dark (no pun intended) secret about this seemingly perfect neighborhood and Chris, starts to have second thoughts about his visit. This film could have been an exploitive and heavy-handed treatment of it's subject matter, but Peele carefully handles racial ignorance/curiosity (the subject of sports players and Black male sexuality are brought up as well as resorting to slang when approaching a Black person) with the same edge, thoughtful observation, and side-splitting humor (yes, there's plenty of it) of the show, but with dread,  mind raping insanity and gore. Peele demonstrates skill for a first timer as he assembles a smart and entertaining thriller with a terrific cast, an eerie score and terrifying visuals, which has me curious to see what he would do next.",

Get Out is that dream realized. Peele's debut is a clever dark satire and provocative horror film that is sure to be a modern classic, mostly because of its racial themes in this age. \n\nThe cast is excellent, from Daniel Kaluuya as the lead, to Bradley Whitford, an outstanding Allison Williams, and the hilarious Lil Rey Howery. The scares are well done (though, a few don't make sense once the reveal is made), the tension is felt throughout, the world is very realized, and the twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat. There are also some really darkly humorous and intentionally awkward moments that were perfect in adding the element of discomfort. This is a movie that is meant to make the audience realize that - despite the over-the-top plot at play, there is a lot of real-world racial tension that needs to be expressed.\n\nMy only fear is that, because Get Out is currently at 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, that people are expecting this to be the greatest film ever made, and may leave overhyped and underwhelmed. It's not The Shining in terms of horror movies, but it is certainly a memorable, fun, and creepy film experience people will be talking about for years to come.",

I'm not sure if first time director Jordan Peele impresses more with that particular balance, or with his ability to effectively display social commentary.\n\nBlumhouse Productions is putting together quite the resume. Their films continue to make bank at the box office, but the diversity of their horror features are nothing to scoff at either.  Just in the last few years alone they've made films like The Gift, The Visit, Split, and now Get Out.  All original twists on the horror/thriller genre.  Get Out may be the most impressive yet.\n\nI always talk about my disconnect with the horror genre and how I don't find much substance with 75% of the films.  Get Out turns the genre on its head, doesn't rely on jump scares, is surrounded by tremendous performances, and has a socially relevant script.  It is so rare for a film to have a socially relevant message without feeling too political or one sided.  I can't tell you how many times I've appreciated what a film or a TV show is saying, but I get turned off by the way it's portrayed.  Get Out manages to make an entertaining horror/thriller, while also commenting on unintentional and benevolent racism coming from a white family towards their daughter's new boyfriend, an African American.\n\nIt's the racism most people don't normally think about.  The people who say they aren't racist because they \"voted for Barack Obama\" or maybe because \"Tiger Woods is their favorite athlete\".  Films like 12 Years of Slave and the recent documentary, 13th, are important.  But it's films like Get Out that are more effective because they are giving the same message in a different way.  Brilliantly written and structured, Peele gets the most out of his actors and times the laughs and scares in an effective manner.  Please go out and support an original film like Get Out.  You won't be disappointed.\n\n+Original\n\n+Laughs and scares\n\n+Really well acted\n\n+Pacing\n\n9.1/10",

            "content": "GUESS WHO'S NOT COMING HOME FROM DINNER? - My Review of GET OUT (3 1/2 Stars)\n\nFor me, the best horror films serve as analogies for some of our most deeply rooted fears, whether it be disease, death, powerlessness, loneliness or even discomfort.  Leave it to writer/director Jordan Peele to come up with a wholly original scare concept.  With GET OUT, he takes white society's co-opting of black culture and turns it into something insidious. Be afraid. Be very afraid!  \n\nAfter a highly effective, SCREAM-esque opening sequence, GET OUT follows Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya, so good in BLACK MIRROR's \"Fifteen Million Merits\" episode) who sets off to the country with his new girlfriend Rose Armitage (GIRLS' Allison Williams) to meet her family.  Despite the fact that she tells him he's her first black boyfriend, Rose insists her parents, while uncool, have completely liberal leanings.  This opening sections does a great job at establishing Chris and Rose's lovely chemistry, but the pacing felt off.  I wished editor Gregory Plotkin, who knows a thing or two about brisk horror films, having cut 4 of the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY movies, had convinced Peele to tighten things up.  It really would have benefitted from losing a good 10 minutes, as many of the scenes suffer from a bit of slackness.  It's not so much about losing scenes as it is about pacing the whole thing up during the first half.  \n\nRegardless, GET OUT truly knows how to surprise its audience. When Chris and Rose hit a deer on the way to her parents, I rolled my eyes at this portentous clich\u00e9. Didn't we just see the same thing in THE INVITATION?  What makes this sequence sing, however, is the interaction they have with a police officer afterwards. Peele plays with the racism of the situation from all angles, showing us what's wrong about racial profiling while also shining a light on white privilege when Rose \"sticks up\" for her man.  \n\nThis awkwardness carries the film through its introductory moments very well, especially when Chris notices that all of the help on the Ermitage Estate are black.  Both the gardener (Marcus Henderson) and the housekeeper, a chillingly effective Betty Gabriel, seem a little off, yet Peele does a good job of distracting us from it by focusing on the humor provided by Rose's parents and brother, played respectively by Bradley Whitford, Catherine Keener, and Caleb Landry Jones, who I loved in THE LAST EXORCISM, but here seems to have come from a  completely different family.  While Whitford goes hilariously out of his way to appear cool to Chris, Keener's psychiatrist character uses hypnosis to get to know their guest.  \n\nIt's here where the film reveals its true agenda, and I won't spoil any of the fun.  Needless to say, the horror elements kick in, forcing Chris and Rose to make some life or death decisions.  Although the scares in the movie come mostly from shock cuts, the premise itself and the escalation of violence are enough to carry the day.  I also enjoyed the depiction of hypnosis, with cinematographer Toby Oliver's work shining in these surreal sequences.  This film really works conceptually.  It's truly original despite it pulling elements from such classics as THE STEPFORD WIVES, ROSEMARY'S BABY, and SECONDS.  What Peele has to say about race lends the film its kick.  At first, Chris finds the Ermitage's reaction to his presence amusing to the point where he feels like he has to work at making them feel ok about their ridiculousness.  When things change, his confidence erodes, with Kaluuya doing some wonderful work.\n\nThe performances across the board rule the day.  Whitford and Keener really know how to play the ambiguity to perfection, and LilRel Howery carries the lion's share of the comic relief quite capably, but its Williams who's the revelation here.  She astonishes in a phone call scene in which she stays stone-faced while vocally acting the hell out of it.  Same goes for the turn in the scene involving a search for keys.  She reminded me Nicole Kidman ease with difficult material in such films as TO DIE FOR and MALICE, perfectly balancing the simultaneous emotions.  America, we have underestimated this treasure!\n\nAlthough overlong, this film has wonderful setups and payoffs, very good performances, and that rarity of rarities, something to say.  While more satirical thriller than horror, Peele, who still needs to learn to \"take three things off before leaving the house\", has made the first really good film of 2017.  It will surely have an interesting relationship with its audiences.  He reminds me of Melvin Van Peebles (WATERMELON MAN) in his desire to poke and provoke.  \n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nFor me, Peele duffs the ending.  While I appreciate it that he gives us the satisfaction of the black men winning, he's aiming for true subversiveness with his premise, and I thought he could have really gone further by having Chris end up in jail for all of the murders.  I can't imagine anyone believing his story and the trail of bodies all lead to him.  You may leave the theatre elated instead of fully enlightened.  \n\n[END SPOILER]",

In fact, the plot and the subtext (if its right to call it that) actually enhance each other. Peele's said that horror and comedy are really very similar, and having seen this I have to agree with his point since the timing is perfect and every satirical laugh is balanced in such a way as to not take away from the horror. And here both horror and comedy are used to confront a very touchy issue in a way that a straight drama couldn't. It's just like Dr. Strangelove in a way: the basic problem is too horrifyingly uncomfortable to be taken seriously. Or Stepford Wives, which is really where this film draws its inspiration. Somehow the blend of uncomfortable racism and suburban horror really elevates the otherwise potentially stale material.",

But when they get it good, you get \"Whiplash\", \"Ouija: Origin of Evil\" and now \"Get Out\". It is nice to see someone with a checkbook take chances. In this instance, they let a stand-up/sketch comedian direct a racially charged, psychological horror film, and they got a critical and box office smash. Aside from the great tension building in the hypnosis scenes that bring to mind \"A Clockwork Orange\", \"Beyond the Black Rainbow\", and \"Under the Skin\", it was great to see Catherine Keener take on a more sinister role. In fact, nearly the whole supporting cast are typically placed in comedic roles which helps solidify the tone and add to the feeling that something is not quite right. Director Jordan Peele obviously has a deep appreciation for horror films as the effective balance of soundtrack, comedy, and thrills culminate in a very rewarding watch. In the sold out theater I watched this in, by the third act people were reacting as one might more commonly see at a screening for a \"Star Wars\" movie. Cheers of approval and gasps at the twists erupted sporadically. Aside from the visceral reaction, I think there was a genuine sense of catharsis from seeing injustice combated. The blatant subtext of the film is cultural appropriation without respect. White culture has effectively harvested from Black culture for decades, yet we still see no true integration. As Black America continues to innovate and form a basis for our understanding of American culture, it continually is appropriated and made family-safe, disseminated into ubiquity without the recognition it is due. This is primarily exemplified by the music industry, but one can notice this trend in parlance and fashion as well. It is extremely interesting that Peele would take the horror genre, a form decidedly set in a rich Anglo/European/American history, and co-opt it for such a scathing social critique. It's probably one of the most effective uses of film for such purposes as I've seen in years. But if you disregard that essential aspect of it, it is pretty much your standard horror film. I'm not going to say it will change your life, but it is pretty damn entertaining and thought provoking.",

This is a movie rich with commentary, suspense, payoffs, and it all begins by exploring the dread-filled everyday existence of African-American men in this country as a waking horror movie that cannot be escaped.\n\nBefore even going further, I advise most readers to go into Get Out with as little knowledge as possible, which I understand means delaying reading this review. I can accept the loss of eyeballs knowing that more people will go in with an even greater ability to be surprised (I'll avoid significant spoilers below, so fear not, dear reader).\n\nChris (David Kaluuya) is visiting the parents of his girlfriend for the first time. He's worried that Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) hasn't mentioned that he's black. She assures him that her rich, wealthy, and liberal family won't care in the slightest. Rose swears her parents are the least racist people she can think of. Dean (Bradley Whitford) is a retired brain surgeon, Missy (Catherine Keener) is a hypnotherapist who volunteers to help Chris stop smoking, and Rose's younger brother, Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones), is obsessed with martial arts and lacrosse. They also have black housekeepers, which Dean says he hates how it looks. It isn't long before Chris' sense of unease starts to make him rethink this weekend getaway and whether or not something sinister is under the surface.\n\nEarly on, Peele tips his hand to the sharp social and genre criticism. In the opening scene we watch Andrew (Lakeith Stanfield), a young black man, walking around lost in a tony suburban neighborhood. He checks his phone for an address when a lone car drives past him, stops, and turns around, pulling up next to Andrew and idling, blasting the old song \"Run Rabbit Run.\" He takes one look at the situation and immediately turns around, heading in the opposite direction. \"Not today,\" he says to himself, clearly providing voice to the audience's apprehension. And yet, he's incapacitated, and abducted by masked assailants. Even self-awareness and avoidance will not be enough for this man to survive if captured within the crosshairs of modern White America. He becomes another horror victim just like we might see splashed across the news all too often.\n\nPeele's biting social commentary is ever-present but it never outpaces the genuine fun and entertainment from his genre storytelling. It's a condemnation of the fallacy of a post-racial society and an exploration of the uncomfortable burdens African-Americans are disproportionately expected to bear in general. Rose's family is all too happy to show off how seemingly inclusive they are. Rose's father confesses, with no legitimate conversational prompting, that he would have voted for Obama a third time (trust me, there's a lot of people in the camp, Dean). Yet he seems to enjoy awkwardly inserting recitations of \"my man\" while also trying to openly explain why he has eerily subservient black housekeepers. Rose's antic brother seems to hungrily size Chris up as a physical challenge to battle, openly admiring his \"genetic gifts.\" Despite their self-styled liberalism and protests to the contrary that race doesn't matter, the family can't help but treat Chris like an other. Race \"doesn't matter\" to people who have the position where it might not matter, the same going for those who elect to be \"color blind.\"\n\nThis stifling sense of condescension and pandering is best exemplified in a deeply awkward sequence where Chris is introduced at a party to the whole older majority-white neighborhood. One man informs him he likes Tiger Woods. Another says being black is hip. A woman squeezes his muscles in transparent lust. Another asks what the \"African-American experience\" is like and whether Chris feels being born black is an advantage. All through this meet-and-greet gauntlet, Chris is holding his carefully crafted smile, trying to shrug off the mounting discomfort, and being told not to make a big deal out of it. After all, these are well-educated liberals, the \"good ones.\" They can't be racist too.\n\nGet Out is also an excellent example of a movie that straddles a precise tone to perfection. Peele has a carefully refined comedy sensibility, but I was genuinely awed in his ability to go from sardonically funny to creepy funny to just plain creepy. There's an increasingly heightened sense of dread from the get-go. It's like any other horror premise where our protagonist goes into the house they shouldn't and combats a host of horrors be they supernatural or superhuman. In this case, the scary scenario is white people. There's a general off feeling about the Armitage estate and this is best encapsulated with their hired help, Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Georgina (Betty Gabriel). They seem to be in a robotic daze, smiles plastered to their faces, their tone of voice disquietingly calm and meticulous. Even the antiquated and culturally incongruous vocabulary they employ contributes to their unsettling vibes. Something is wrong here. There is a remarkable scene where Chris speaks with Georgina, and she hovers closer to him to apologize. Peele keeps the camera locked on his actor's faces in extreme close-ups and he has a damn good reason for it. Gabriel (The Purge: Election Year) tries to reassure him all is normal and in one mesmerizing moment the camera fixates on her as she repeats \"no,\" each time a different reflection, her eyes tearing up as she tries to fight back subverted emotions. It's feels like you're watching twenty emotions and impulses fighting for dominance behind an impassive mask of compliance. Peele magnificently finds ways to keep his elements intensely upsetting while still finding room to laugh and break tension and increase tension.\n\nWhile more a suspense thriller than a traditional horror film, Peele proves himself shockingly adept at a genre that I would have assumed outside his comfort zone. The shot arrangements and the natural development of tension shows clear knowledge and affinity for the horror genre; Peele knows when to hold onto a moment for extra suspense, when to pull back, and especially when to litter the camera frame with something to draw the eye. Peele has a great eye for his troubling, surreal visuals. When Chris is hypnotized and instructed to \"sink into the floor\" it's like he's falling into an inky void while his consciousness plays out on a square, like his life is a movie only he can watch from a distance. You feel the helplessness but it's also a beautiful and beautifully unnerving image. There are a few jump scares accompanied by loud musical stings but the far majority of the movie is the overwhelming discomfort and dread marvelously kept at a continual simmer. I was squirming in my seat for long stretches and started backpedaling in others, and I can't remember another movie in years affecting me that well. It's partly the terrific execution of his genre elements but also partly because I liked the protagonist and had no idea what would happen to him next, which is the foundation of all horror. The last act cranks up the genre elements but Peele has brilliantly structured his script, laying out all the pieces he'll need that provide an array of payoffs when we're breaking for the finish line. This is a movie that knows how to satisfy all audiences, rest assured.\n\nThe actors are pitch-perfect and Kaluuya (Sicario, Black Mirror) delivers a star-making performance. He has to wear his own mask to deal with the small and large iniquities of whether or not these people are sinister or whether they're just oblivious cretins. Chris is a black man expected to mind his manners and to laugh away the casual ignorance afforded by the oblivious privilege of others. He can never be unaware as the lone black man in a sea of white faces. It's a position I think many people in the audience will be able to relate to and hopefully others can empathize with. Kaluuya has some standout emotional sequences where he digs deep to show the real depth of a character others fetishize or dismiss. Kaluuya is also British and you'd never know it. The Armitage family clan are each their own slice of weird. Whitford (The Cabin in the Woods) is exploding with thinly veiled smarm and great comic awkwardness. Keener (Capote) is chilling in her icy WASP den mother role with her weapon of choice, and hypnotic aid, being a literal silver spoon. Williams is like her blithely privileged character stepped out of HBO's Girls, and her flippant attitude to Chris's perspective belies something familiar and darker. The other best actor in the movie is LilRel Howrey (The Carmichael Show) who play's a friend to Chris that works for the TSA. He's a reliable and reliable crude source of comic relief but he's also our ally on the outside, and he behaves like an intelligent investigator trying to save him. I was actually applauding his sensible steps to see through the sinister conspiracy.\n\nIt's been hours since I saw Get Out and I'm still buzzing from the experience. I was unprepared for how genuinely unnerving and invigorating the movie was as a horror thriller, character piece, but also as a trenchant social satire on race. Jordan Peele has established himself as an immediate visionary in the world of horror, taking the black protagonist who might usually be the first to get killed in a Hollywood slasher flick and widening the boundaries of horror. The real-lie horror film is day-to-day existence in the United States as a person of color. Get Out was conceived in the Obama era but has even more renewed resonance under the beginnings of the Age of Trump. I remember people saying that America now existed in a post-racial world, but we live in the kind of world that takes a call for innocent black lives to stop being executed by police officers and transforms it into All Lives Matter. It's a hazardous world and Peele has created a marvelous movie where the insidious, ever-present force that cannot be escaped is not a maniac with a chainsaw or some cranky ghost, it's white society itself. As the news has indicated, from Trayvon Martin to Sandra Bland and numerous others, there isn't exactly a safe territory to escape to. Danger and death can come at any moment as long as a larger society perceives black skin as a threat first and a person second. Get Out is a timely movie but also timeless, thanks to how brilliantly conceived, developed, and executed Peel's movie performs. This will make my top ten list for the year. Simply put, stop whatever you're doing and go out to go see Get Out as soon as possible.\n\nNate's Grade: A",

However, ONE THING is for certain for a horror film to work - LESS IS MORE. \"Get Out\" hit the nail on the head.... What made it work was the premise, and reality of it (outside of certain parts that I won't share as to not give away the film),  there was no over the top CG, or any typical T&A and meaningless sex, it was a purely psychological, with a great mix of humor (the guy who played the character Rod's comedic timing was absolutely perfect). I recommend going to see the film, though I must say the theater I went to had a lot of movie goers giving commentary during the film, which wasn't that great, but overall, the film definitely deserved a certified fresh rating.... Kudos to Jordan Peele for his directorial debut - assuming nothing goes awry between now and the 2018 awards season - I can definitely see a few golden globes, and possibly an oscar nomination for original screenplay. Side Note - The act\nress who played Georgina (Betty Gabriel) is definitely one to watch - she definitely played her character well - she was oft-times more frightening that the parents.",

            "content": "First off, I want to address the significant amount of people avoiding this film labeling it \"anti-white.\" Film is art. Thus, by definition it is a creative expression of how the creator of said art feels about himself or the environment that surrounds him or her. Therefore, if one cannot handle that, I do not know what the point is of watching anything then.\n\n\tNow, in regards to Get Out, allow me to first address the story. Get Out it is much more than a simple (and obvious) analysis of our culture and how interactions between minorities/lower social classes and predominant, high class members of society are perceived by the former. If one keeps this central theme in the back of his or her head and ventures to examine other elements of the film, it is a clear satire not only of the typical thriller genre but also of slavery, supremacism, and profiling. \n\t\n\tFor instance, take the motives behind the Armitage family's crimes. Though considering themselves as a smarter and superior people, they target African-Americans because they consider them to be \"in fashion\" and physically superior. One of them is even seen choosing her next target by simply using Bing to search \"NCAA athletes.\" These situations immediately raise the question, \"If people of color are treated and viewed as inferior, why then do predominant races attempt to be like them and blend in.\" This is a clever way to address the strong polarity America has on African-American people. It explores the idea that though some may admire people of color in Hollywood and in sports, the same people have prejudice against them depending on their socioeconomic background.\n\n\tAdditionally, in a scene seen during the trailer, the protagonist is a victim of police profiling. In this scenario, the protagonist is perfectly okay with this and has his state identification ready, implying this is a social norm. Writer/Director Jordan Peele then uses this same circumstance to create a supremely clever payoff to prove to all his viewers that this truly is a sad social norm that lives within us all. I am afraid I can not give much detail as to how Peele satirizes slavery without giving away too much of the plot.\n\n\tRegardless, let's move to the technical side of Get Out. The film begins with a exceptional tracking shot. It left me confused since I thought most of the movie would be like this, which would make for an odd thriller since most rely on editing for their suspenseful effects. Evidently, I was wrong. The opening was one of a few tracking shots and the film used editing to its full advantage. However, as decent as the visual aspect of Get Out was, it does not compare to the sound. My goodness, the sound effects and mixing were incredible. Trevor Gates was the man in charge of sound mixing. He is no stranger to making us feel uncomfortable and on the edge of our seats since he was the man in charge of the sounds of Ouija: Origin of Evil and Don't Breathe. \n\nOverall, the film was very well made. Much better than required for the thriller genre, I may add. I would definitely recommend this movie to those in search of a thought-provoking thriller, fans of horror, or even fans of a good comedy. In regards to the story, I would only advise to keep an open mind as which any other form of art. Get Out is without a doubt a step in the right direction for first time director Jordan Peele and I cannot wait to see what he and his eye for detail have in store for us in the future.",

It was slow for the first half, and so many of the scenes (like, all of them) felt forced and unnatural. I guess it felt like a writer/director's first time. Not bad for a first attempt, but it's not what I would call a good movie.\n\nI think it has such a high rating because of the racial sensationalism in our country right now - the film critics are either white-guilted into convincing themselves that this is a great film, or they're scared of being called racist if they don't like it... because there's no way it's worth 100%.",

At first, I was like,  \"This is supposed to be a comedy/thriller/horror flick and it doesnt do any of the genres all that amazing!\" Which normally would mean a hard flop, right? ...but Peele and the surprisingly good cast of performances pile jokes on top of scares until you give up trying to figure out exactly what the film is supposed to be and sit back and enjoy one of the most entertaining and politically bold films in recent memory. The movie shows such smart control of tone (just slightly off in a good way) and pace (slow, steady). Peele has dubbed his movie a \u00e2??social thriller\u00e2?? and he\u00e2??s right on the mark. Like all powerful horror and suspense films, Get Out takes everyday fears and tensions and nudges them into the freaky. Peele also knows just when and how to slacken the tension with a laugh. Get Out emerges as one of the freshest reworkings of the horror genre in years but that's mostly because it\u00e2??s one sizzling with social commentary about race relations in America and that will be how and why it's remembered. The satire here is real, blunt and funny. There's some impressive filmmaking skills here, too. His debut feature has some memorably shocking sequences, including cool hypnotism sequences. These cinematic flourishes are layered with racial subtext regarding slavery, master race ideology and liberal guilt that weaves throughout the movie with unexpected brilliance. The shocks, laughs and suspense are all entertaining but it's the truth in the film that should make you Get Out and watch.",

It's well documented throughout the anneals of history that African Americans have had it pretty shitty, and rarely do we get a glimpse into the realistic day to day eyes and emotions of those subjected to prejudice in a way that isn't heavy handed and begging for Oscar gold. \"Get Out\" is grounded in reality in its attempt to portray how it feels to have nothing but white eyes staring at you, and Peele brilliantly holds on to that sense of unease and judgement throughout the film. See that's the scare. There's no monster, no serials murderers with axes or chainsaw wielding cannibals, and yet the tension in this movie is far more palpable than any of those old tired horror clich\u00c3\u00a8s because it's real. We know it exists. In fact, it happens every single day. \"Get Out\" has the impossibly self assured hands of a long-time master for a first time director, along with an absolutely rock solid script(to which he's also penned), holding onto racial tension and paranoia throughout, building to a satisfying ending for which any horror fan will appreciate. Imagine \"Look Who's Coming to Dinner\" had a baby with \"The Stepford Wives\" who had a mild fling with \"Deliverance\". Oh yeah, and it's pretty damn funny too. Deftly crafted and balanced in both giggles and gore, this is one of the better pictures in the genre since the brilliant \"It Follows\". It seems horror is being lifted from the exploitative dumps of the five dollar DVD bin and back to the top shelf, and the movie going world is better for it.",

I was told it was worth seeing, looked up the score on rotten tomatoes and it was good. \n\nAs for the movie: HOLY CRAP IT IS GOOD!!! I thought it would be a jump scare, maybe slash em up movie but I was wrong. \n\nIf you're a fan of Gravity Falls and or Star vs The Forces of Evil you will like this movie. It's an odd comparison, I know, but hear me out. In the movie no detail is too small, just like Gravity Falls. There are twists, surprises, it's genuinely creepy, excellently acted and has a good story that takes a concept we've seen before in Skeleton Key and Human Centipede (without all the gross out stuff) and you want to figure out what is going on. If you're familiar with the thinking strategies behind Star and Gravity Falls you'll start to figure it out faster than those who aren't, but it's still super enjoyable. \n\nThere's really only one thing I can say I saw as a mistake and that was when the phone that was supposed to be dead made a chirping noise when he plugged it in. I'm sure there are others that I'm missing but it obviously didn't ruin the movie. \n\nThis was the first time I actually mouthed \"Holy crap no way!\" and covered my mouth from surprise. It is one of the few movies that I felt every cent of the ticket price was worth it. This hint: it's such a wild ride and you want to pay attention to the details, so go to the bathroom before the movie. There really isn't any good time to do so in the movie. \n\nI would rate this movie 5/5 and it is definitely worth the view.",

I was expecting a bit more of something to the plot, but I wasn't totally impressed by some of the scenes that were meant to be unnerving.  It somewhat relies too heavily on the strange/menacing/benign nature of the white (and some of the black) characters to the point where the movie lacked nuance and was always having me questioning everything that happened, which in turn took away some credibility of the main character in addition to taking away the thrill.  Also, the hypnotizing stuff kind of fell flat for me.  Not just the how, but mainly the what didn't really give me much of anything like the trailers suggested.

What I got was the exact opposite. \"RACIAL SATIRE, UNNEEDED RACISM TO 'PROVE' A POINT.\" The only fucking reason the movie gave as to why the victim(s) were black while the perpetrator's were white is because rich, white, posh, assholes wish to literally live in a black body. Which makes no sense, because if the plot is built upon racism why would racists YEARN to live as what they DISGUST? Plus the other half of the victims that were mind controlled by white brains, was because \"Black is in fashion,\" \"I want your eyes, son,\" or them just being in peak physical condition. Only one of the cases actually needed a black person. I wanted so badly for this to be a critique about the newly arisen racial tension in America but it turned out to be more of an \"anti-white\" film. Oh how I will hate how people will use this as an example to \"prove\" racism as being the worst thing ever. \nOn a positive note, the acting was incredible, really the only reason it got 2 stars. Everyone in the film played their characters amazingly. Then I threw in another half star for the dark and dry humor that I personally enjoy, but even went overboard when the Black victim's friend found him after the ordeal and said \"I told you not to go into that house.\"\nI had to chug my overpriced shit soda after that one.\nAnyways, thanks for the read and I hope you guys enjoyed it much more than I.",

            "content": "Get Out movie review (NO SPOILERS):  Jordan Peele (of Key and Peele fame) needs to take a bow. Because he's about to get a LOT of attention.  This movie was fantastic.  It manages to have the same creepy, unnerving dread of classic horror/thrillers you (and obviously Peele himself) grew up loving while still feeling fresh and particularly relevant today.  This is not just your standard fare. This movie actually has something to say. \n\nIt's successful not just because it's wonderfully crafted, but also because of the sometimes subtle, yet biting and wholely relevant social commentary which runs throughout the film.  This manner in which this is presented serves to bond the audience to its lead character and allows us a perspective, while immediately engaging, most genre films would shy away from. \n\nPeele's choice of his protagonist and the perspective he's allowing us in on is not the only reason this works. The film is exceptionally well cast and features some of the finest acting I've seen in years.  In particular, Daniel Kaluuya, who's work in the lead role as Chris, is bound to get him some serious looks.  Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener as the parents have never been better, and Betty Gabriel turns in a supremely creepy performance as Georgina.  I could list every cast member here as they all had their moments and there were no flat, throwaway characters. Everything served the story. \n\nOne of the reasons this film was so satisfying was the work of Chris's best friend played by Lil Rel Howery.  Not only did he provide much needed comic relief throughout a tense and taught thriller, but very much served as the voice of the audience.  He stole every scene he was in. \n\nTo sum up,  this is a beautifully crafted  movie and it's hard  to believe it's Peele's directorial debut. I will watch this again and again and can't wait to see what he does next. Go see it!",

            "content": "I've seen many Horror films over the years. A lot of them look very much like each other. Most of these films are veeeery generic in formula or are just not executed right. We have long since been removed from the days of legendary slasher films and went through many years of found footage style films that have almost all been duds. Now, of all the people to give us a brand new fresh horror film, it is none other than one half of comedy duo Key and Peele, Jordan Peele. Peele gives us a horror film like no other, one that deals with the subject of racism. Get Out is of the more creative and uniquely executed stories for this genre and it is very suprising.\n\tGet Out is about Chris, a black photographer and his white girlfriend Rose. The two of them are going up to rose's parents house for the weekend. Chris meets her parents and the inhabitants of their area that all exhibit bizarre unusual behavior. It doesn't take long for Chris to be freaked out and he later discovers a dark secret about the family.\n\tA very solid unique film. It actually transcends a bit beyond horror and is more of a racial satire.I initially went in thinking Jordan Peele was going to just hammer in statements about racism when it comes to interacial interactions. He actually instead utilizes more of the uncomfortable and tense atmosphere when black people are surrounded by folks who act a certain way based on the color of your skin to make his point. A brilliant directorial choice that served him well this entire film. \nthe film had some great humorous moments that you don't often see in horror films. good cinematography and good editing as well. \nAlison Williams and Daniel kaluuya were both excellent especially Kaluuya in his first real film role. Their facial expressions body language and even their ability to disappear into the world of the characters was nice to watch and very impressive. Bradley Whitford did a fine job here. He provided a nice blend of being mysterious and unsettling in nature. One of his best roles since his days on the west wing.Even Catherine Keener did well here. She played one of the real key roles in this film than the trailer leads on. \nOverall 2 thumbs way up and I must say I am looking forward to more films directed by Mr. Peele",

The movie feeds off a paranoia that the majority of the United States population doesn't experience on a regular basis. Fake smiles and awkward handling of racially charged conversations are masterfully put on display in the first half of the movie. The cracks in the white facade intensify at a steady pace. Uncomfortable questions or points start popping up in the viewer's mind. What is up with the eclectic decor (explicitly called out)? Why are all the black \"caretakers\" acting \"white\" on the property? Are we, as white people, really this ignorant? In short, you start to feel an entire system is out to get our protagonist. Admittedly, an early scene explicitly sets the stage up. Mainstream horror films play it safe with the usual jump scares and gory imagery. To be sure, Get Out sports a fair amount of both elements. At some point, all too shockingly familiar racism starts to out scare the traditional horror cliches. Unfortunately, several dumb horror tropes also make an appearance. For example, you have that one horror scene where you have an odd figure chopping wood. The others tropes I could list involve spoilers. The acting is consistently top notch from all involved. I only have one minor quip with the casting choice of a peripheral character. The character certainly sticks out when you notice him and the inclusion is somewhat puzzling. Overall, the subject matter more than makes up for Get Out's very minor shortcomings. How often do movies aimed at a mainstream audience have the audacity to call out whites in America? The timing of the film's release is sadly impeccable. Racism is alive and well in our country. America \"smiled\" when she elected Trump as POTUS. I congratulate Jordan Peele for his impressive foray into directing. The film is dense and I certainly missed a few points on my first viewing.",

At times the tone did feel jarring, but would quickly recover. The lead performance from Daniel Kaluuya was a standout for me and leaves me excited for his future projects. I highly recommend Get Out if you are a fan of horror, comedy, or just great movies in general. Go see it in a packed theatre -- you won't regret the experience.",

It relies on very few jump scares and actually just maintains a scary vibe without them. I was invested in this movie from the moment it started. I felt it was wholly original and endlessly creative. It's the type of movie that I want to watch again to analyze and look for hints I missed the first time. I was consistently wondering how this movie was going to end and was truly surprised by how it ended. I also found myself laughing a lot since there is a comedic relief character that never feels forced. I think the movie is somewhat over the top in places and has a couple moments that are paced a bit slower than the rest. Regardless, the finale of this movie is insanely entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The movie also has a lot of social commentary going for it, which made it even more unique. It's a movie that defies genre conventions and is most definitely worth seeing. Jordan Peele is a surprisingly phenomenal filmmaker and I wouldn't be surprised if he took some time off from sketch comedy to make more movies like this.",

Jordan Peele proves that Comedy is not the only area in film he can succeed in (Key & Peele). This is a truly interesting and original concept which turns racial stereotyping and modern day racism into an extremely strong social commentary. Like Peele has done in the past, there are flat out hilarious moments in \"Get Out\" that make it damn near impossible not to enjoy it even if the film comes across as too \"bizarre\" for non horror fans. Avoiding major spoilers, this is an important and incredibly well conceived concept that blends multiple genres together while pulling apart what today's world defines as prejudices and racist thinking both from a black/white perspective. It's just disappointing that some less open minded people will leave the theatre not appreciating the true meaning behind the film. One of the best Horror/Comedies of all time and a must see for those looking for something new. It's very rarely I'll rate a movie a perfect score. On another note, this film has possibly the most hilarious character I've seen in a long while (The TSA friend).",

            "content": "Proper Perspective: This movie is not going to reinvent the wheel in the horror genre, but it also doesn't break or hinder the wheel. More of a mystery-thriller with elements of horror sprinkled in throughout...\n\nOfficial Synopsis: A young African-American man visits his Caucasian girlfriend's mysterious family estate.\n\nPlot: When Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose (Allison Williams) go on a \"meet the parents\" trip to Rose's family home out in a remote location, things get weird. Initially it appears to be the awkwardness of parents meeting the boyfriend, who also happens to be a different race than them, but slowly devolves into what appears to be tests, or racism, or attacks, and at an annual family party everything comes to a head.\n\nTake: Like I already mentioned, this movie does not reinvent the wheel. It is a social commentary on racism today, the subtleties and the obviousness. There is some of The Stepford Wives vibes initially, then it turns into a mystery and psychological thriller. Who is doing what? What should we believe? What is happening???\n\nThe movie did a good job of dropping bread crumbs along the way for the audience, but not the entire loaf. As you watch you can piece together where they are going, not in a bad way. This movie is like piecing a puzzle together, sort of knowing the final picture, but the surprise at the end is still worth the journey.\n\nI really liked the overall story, acting, and direction of this movie. It is Jordan Peele's first feature directorial effort. The movie was also written by Peele, who has also written on MadTV, Key and Peele, and last year's Keanu. He has a knack for character and story, peppering in the jokes to lighten the mood and keep the viewer off balance.\nThe jokes were too much at times, but this style can work in horror where tension is released with a fun character gag.\n\nTo compare this to another directorial debut, say last year's \"Morgan\" from Luke Scott (Ridley Scott's son), this is a better overall film.\n\nThe rest of the cast is rounded out by Lakeith Stanfield (Short Term 12, Straight Outta Compton), Catherine Keener (40 Year Old Virgin), Bradley Whitford (The Cabin in the Woods, West Wing), Caleb Landry Jones (X-Men: First Class), and Lilrel Howery (The Carmichael Show). The cast played well of each other and nobody felt out of their depth.\n\nRecommendation: In a year, that is not quite two months in, we have two very good thriller/horror movies in Split and now Get Out. I'd recommend going out to support this film if you are one that clamors for original movies and less sequels, remakes, reboots, etc...\n\n2017, well done so far. Well done indeed.",

Get Out is not a comedy though it contains a fair amount of laughs, namely from the performance of stand-up comedian LilRel Howery who will get many, many jobs from this star-making performance. What Get Out actually turns out to be is a rather striking thriller that provides a topical conversation around racial tensions that then amplifies and exaggerates the inherent tensions of its presented scenario in a way that both plays with the tropes of the horror genre while delivering commentary on innate and unavoidable fears in the black community. I heard someone explain it as, \"playing on black people's fear of white people's fear of black people,\" and it's hard to put it any better or more simply than that. This is all to get to the point that Get Out is making the point that we need to stop pretending we know what it's like to walk in other people's shoes. Not that these assumptions can't be compassionate, but more that they are unnecessary. Get Out begins as one thing-playing on the natural awkwardness that comes along with a black guy going to meet his white girlfriends entirely white family in their very white/suburban neighborhood for the first time and then, once it arrives there, takes steps using its genre classification to get at this idea that no matter how good or well-intentioned one might be, it is near impossible to have a real comprehension of what people who have experienced struggles and/or faced some kind of oppression have indeed been through and more over, who they became out of such experiences. Get Out is a film that plays on those facets of ourselves that we'd rather not acknowledge-that no matter how much we believe ourselves to be above stereotyping people or forming preconceptions, that there is a truth to such ways of thinking and Peele uses this unavoidable, unflattering truth to draw out a fair amount of anxiety. Peele plays on those anxieties and social standards exceptionally as through to the very last frame Get Out keeps things as taut as any horror movie in recent memory while never losing sight of its original intent no matter how crazy the genre hijinks get.         \n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

            "content": "GET OUT\nDirector/Writer: Jordan Peele\nStarring: Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Bradley Whitford, Catherine Keener, Lakeith Stanfield, Lil Rel Howery, Stephen Root, Marcus Henderson, Betty Gabriel\n\nI would never have thought funnyman Jordan Peele would have turned to the horror genre for his directorial debut. He's best known as one half of the Comedy Central duo Key and Peele. After their show ended, they released the cat action comedy Keanu last year, and now Peele is flying solo. There's that old myth that the black guy always dies in a scary movie, and Peele is shifting that around with Get Out. Girls star Allison Williams stars as Rose Armitage who is excited to take her boyfriend, Chris (Kaluuya), home to meet her parents and brother. He feels a bit worried, as she hasn't broken the news to them that she's dating a black man. Rose doesn't feel a concern in the world as she states they are extremely welcoming and that her dad, Dean (Whitford), would have voted for Obama a third time. Rose's parents have a picture perfect estate nestled in the woods. Dean is a bit abrasive to Chris at first, while her mom, Missy (Keener), is quieter and introspective. She's basically studying his demeanor and behavior due to her work as a psychiatrist and hypnotist. Chris happens to notice that they have a maid and a groundskeeper who both happen to be black.\n\nRose tries to remind him that it will be a lovely weekend, but he has his guard up. There's something off about the maid and groundskeeper. They appear to be doing their jobs, but they have a wide-eyed, zombie-like disposition where they're not all together with it. The weekend carries on with the Armitage family hosting an outdoor party. All of the guests are white, rich, and lavish. The sole black partygoer is around Chris's age and also appears to be in this alternative state of mind. Chris can't help shake that there is something deeply wrong with this family and their friends. His best friend, Rod (Howery), works as a TSA agent and starts to dig deeper into this mystery when Chris finds himself trapped in the Armitage's house.\n\nWithin the opening sequence, you can easily tell that Jordan Peele has a knack for directing horror. It opens in that dark and quiet suburban neighborhood. It was very reminiscent of Halloween in that sense, including the use of hedges. It's very suspenseful and eerie without relying on cheap tricks. It sets the stage for what's to come as it shifts to the introduction of Rose and Chris's relationship. Peele takes his time with a nice build up with the characters and the relationship within the family. He remembers that in order for scary movies to be effective you have to care about the characters. He gives it that slow burn effect as the suspenseful moments build up to a grand finale. So much of the movie relies on Chris's growing suspicion, and Peele knows how to keep him teetering on the edge of sanity. I never felt like it was pummeled with obnoxious jump scares or blood and guts as a way of being scary. Betty Gabriel and Marcus Henderson are creepy enough as the maid and groundskeeper, respectively. They have some evil death stares while keeping a Pollyanna grin on their face at times.\n\nWhat you normally don't find in horror films, especially of late, is a social commentary. Jordan Peele adds a fair amount of racial dialogue and satire in the film when Chris realizes the mental state and behavior of the other black characters in juxtaposition of the extremely privileged white community present. As the dad, Bradley Whitford tries to acknowledge it but passes it off as pure irony. The party guests all have a certain \"reaffirming\" way of speaking to Chris where think they're being polite, but it's all comes out incorrectly. Race isn't the only hot topic as I felt a connection to Scientology given Catherine Keener's profession as a psychiatrist and hypnotist. Not to get too spoilery here but brain washing comes into play with Kenner going into the subconscious of Chris's mind.\n\nThe films boasts a perfectly cast family. Williams is not nearly as annoying as her Girls character Marnie can be. Whitford and Keener are clearly having a barrel of fun as Mom and Dad. This is the first time I've seen British actor Daniel Kaluuya, and he can easily pull of the paranoid aspects of Chris. Jordan Peele doesn't fully drop his comedic side and cast Lil Rel Howery in the comedic sidekick role of the film. Howerey brings out just enough laughs at the expense of what's going on with the situation and how seriously he takes his job as a TSA agent.\n\nGet Out is impressive move for Jordan Peele has he continues on in his post Key and Peele career. I've already seen two pathetic genre movies this year with The Bye Bye Man and Rings. Peele stays clear of their issues as he's a smart writer and doesn't try too hard to make it scary. There are pacing issues that become evident with its slow burn nature. This will no doubt become an issue in the current age where scary movies need to move at lightning speed. I can only assume Peele will work on this as his directing career takes off. He's written in some good laughs like I mentioned earlier, but the balance between laughter and screams isn't as consistent as it is in films like Scream and Shaun of the Dead. The film comes with that third act twist that is often found smart horror movies. It makes sense if you're putting the puzzle pieces together like Chris is. By the end, the audience was cheering and applauding. That certainly didn't happen with Rings. I'm looking forward to seeing Jordan Peele take on these genre-bending types of movies. I'll gladly sign up for more funny-scary movies from him.\n\nIs It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? Horror fans looking for something fresh and exciting will get a kick out of Get Out.\n\nRATING: 3.5 out of 5 TICKET STUBS",

Some of you need to stop trying to play the victim card when you know it isn't the same. You're not the victim. You're not being oppressed. You're not underrepresented. STOP. If you're not racist, then you're not racist, but stop trying to act as if racism doesn't still exist. Stop taking movies with a message personally if they don't apply to you. Instead, let them inform you on some of the crap people have to go through because of something as simple as the color of there skin.",

It perfectly encapsulates the quiet apprehension that lies under the surface when initially meeting a non-black stranger; the fear of whiteness as an assertion of power. The inherent violence of whiteness, as a political identity, is something that many previous horror flick directors have dabbled with (see Kevin Smith's 'Red State') but have never tackled with such transparency and vigor. Peele sets himself apart by daring to take it to the deepest darkest corners of our bigotry",

I loved Keanu and thought that the trailer for Get Out looked really interesting so I had to check it out. I had a blast in the theater with a pretty engaged audience and a fun crowd, the direction is impeccable, the performances are awesome and the film overall was a great original concept.\n\nHowever, leaving the theater I tried to think back to just one white person who wasn't evil in the movie and I couldn't think of any. I would've felt better if there was even one regular white dude for comedy relief to comment on how crazy the town was, but nope. That seemed like a kind of mean-spirited and unnecessarily divisive depiction, especially in the world we live in right now. The last thing we need is more narrative trying to get us to fear each other for no reason which was the opposite of what was happening in the theater where everyone was enjoying themselves regardless.

Peele has proven to have an auteur's eye in many of the sketches he directed, and his transition to cinema is often impressive. He gives viewers plenty of great bits of gore and viscera, and keeps the pacing interesting so that horror fans shouldn't be (too) bummed that the killings don't come to the film's last act. Unfortunately though, Peele's talents as a writer are less evident in this picture. While it's filled to the brim with good ideas, most of them aren't explored to their full potential, and the ending feels a bit rushed as our hero seems to get out a bit too conveniently. Still, Get Out is certain to be a crowd pleaser for its target audience, and if Peele were open to explore more of the film's mythology for a sequel than I would be open for it.",

It's equally funny as it is suspenseful and scary. If you've seen the trailer you know the premise - and without spoiling it delivers without shying away.  An interracial couple is at the meet the parents stage and the weekend for Chris at his girlfriends home is one that he will never ever forget. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",

He is so natural that it feels as though he's breaking the 4th Wall at times, which is one of my favorite parts of his performance. Marcus Henderson, as normal, is just brilliant in his small but key role. But the real star of the movie is LilRel Howery. Showing great comedic and dramatic chops, LilRel shows why he's is a superstar in the making. \n\nThe entire Armitage Family is excellent and truly terrifying.

            "content": "Get Out Movie Review\nA riveting trailer with answers practically written all over it, the beginning of the film being so predictable you begin to question its predictability, when in fact it is that predictable. When the film reaches its climax stage it all unfolds, the \"mystery\" we have all been waiting to be unveiled... Why is it so obvious and an even more important question is; why was I still so engaged up until the end? Now a film cannot be scrutinized for its predictability, if it reaches the stage where it is predictable to the point you don't care what happens next, that's where you should have a problem, but what is so different with Get Out? Why are the clich\u00e9's so exhilarating?\nCharacter Development is such a huge factor in film, the absence of it in this movie makes the narrative, the plot and the message so much more interesting. The deer getting killed, Chris' identification with it and embodiment of it, the racial profiling from the police officer, all this veered the audience into the message of \"White people dislike Black people\" when in fact it is nothing of the sort. The film attacks the idea that there is such a difference between Black and White people, it simply states yes we have different minds and intuition, we are each enhanced in our own way but by no means are we different as people, as a society.\nNow besides the clear racial messages this film utters it possesses lots of clich\u00e9's, the protagonists heroic and merciless resurgence, the ever so satisfying death to all rampage which makes any supporter in the audience yell \"Yes!\" behind the grit of their teeth. The female protagonists sudden turn to antagonist and complete transformation of character, this brings us back to the lack of character development, as to say yes she changed completely right at the end; suddenly tying her hair in a ponytail, but did we ever know her? I certainly didn't gasp when she turned, whether predictable or not she never truly had an identity. This applies to Chris as well, his immediate concern of her parents knowing that he is Black, as to say the people who are concerned with the differences of Blacks and Whites are the people who lack any character themselves as they restrict themselves from... Well, themselves.\nI think this film has many layers, too many for me to be bothered to try and analyze, and had tons of depth in the story, the pacing was great, the acting was fantastic and the directing performance was brilliant. This is a great thriller, it won't blow you away with plot-twists but it will keep you on the edge of your seat feeding you more information which you thought you predicted, but you actually did predict it, then thought it couldn't be that predictable, but it actually was that predictable, but then turns out it wasn't, no wait it actually was.\nMy rating for this movie is:\n9/10\nReview Summary: Unpredictably predictable, therefore unpredictable, but pretty predictable. Not.",

This movie is also brave to venture into the R zone unlike most horror movies these days. What's so great about the suspense and thrills is that it makes the movie extremely scary if it's your first time watching. The movie is also clever with its reveals and twists. One great thing about this movie is that normally too much gore in a horror movie ruins it, but in this movie it just adds to the scary factor. Another amazing thing is that this movie is directed by Jordan Peele. Just wow he did a great job with this movie. He really did a great job with mixing up comedy with horror. This movie just found a way to be scary and extremely funny at the same time. This movie just kept finding ways to impress everyone and won't disappoint. Can't wait for DVD release. Overall this is just an amazing movie and makes the most of what it has. A+",

            "content": "*this review contains spoilers\n\nLives up to the buzz, although if I had managed to avoid the buzz I think the film would have come as much more of a surprise. \n\nWhat is great about Peele's choice of direction is that he manages to take a serious issue (racism), normally the subject of either (satire) comedy or serious drama, and set it within a genre that fuses these two things together in a wonderful and unexpected social commentary. Actually, I am surprised that the horror genre hasn't really tackled the subject in the past, as it really is perfect for bringing to light a discussion of the underlining fears that guide the issue in both past and present (which is really what horror, in general, does so well, is take a familiar issue of our day and use it to confront our fears and our questions surrounding the issue). \n\nRight from the start, I was able to recognize Peele's interest in playing with some familiar horror movie (and other genre movies) tropes. For example the opening scene, which shows a black man getting killed is juxtaposed with the young, white girl getting killed in the end. It is almost easy to miss the fact that he is playing with the idea (or fact) that horror films typically open with a young, white girl being the first to get killed. It's subtle, but it actually sets the tone for the film to make a strong social statement about our stereotypes, tendencies and neighbourhood. It is also no mistake that the film makes its lead a black man living in a suburban neighbourhood, given that the normal setting for a hollywood horror is setting the white person in an urban (inner city) neighbourhood. In doing this it forces us to re-examine the nature of our fear and how it is being displayed on-screen. \n\nAnd this is really where the film gets interesting. Again, in strong spoiler territory, the whole premise of the film as it eventually veers into almost science fiction territory, brings out the image of the black experience being one of feeling stuck in their own skin without a voice. Unable to speak and express themselves even though they can see what is going on around them. It is a powerful symbol that Peele unveils with a strong creative force. This is not your basic horror story, even though, in many respects, it feels like that is exactly what it sets out to be. \n\nI love the way the film takes a singular experience that many of us (who are not black) could not truly understand (of being the only black man in the room), and weaves it into a story that we can empathize with and recognize from our own experience (for example, as a white, caucasian male). And the truth is, recognizing this story from the perspective of a white male was incredibly uncomfortable and revealing. And it should be. I recognize that I am associated with much of the incredibly shameful, and even sometimes subtle (but no less harmful) racism that the film exposes. Not that I believe I am racist (I chose to stand against all forms of it), but that my actions can certainly still be unintentionally racist, whether I know it or not. And it is helpful to be aware of this. \n\nWhat is even more interesting is the films over arching metaphors (which shed light on the kind of extreme white supremacy that seemed to be resurfacing during Trumps recent campaign) really give way to those subtleties as the more important conversation for everyday life in our modern day. We can recognize extremism, and most of us would disagree with it, but we don't always see those subtleties. The film reminds us that in much of American (North American) history, blacks were not only treated like commodities, but in many ways they were also feared, largely by those who thought they would (and could) overpower the dominant white population of the time. And fear can cause us to do and think some pretty terrible things sometimes. And what makes Get Out perhaps most scary of all, most horrifying, is that some of these fears still exist, even if they look a little bit different or less obvious. To this end Peele has done us all a favour by shedding a welcome light on the black experience.",

The ending is an utter frustration for me, it's just a trite revenge of a black man. I mean, come on, after this beautiful premise, even innovative for a genre, you resolve all this in a bloody one-sided act of vengeance which delivers nothing, actually, no thrill at all, it's predictable with its each step.\nAnother beautiful thing about this movie that it's multilayered. It could be interpreted differently. It could be seen as a sarcasm on black man's fears of white people, it could be seen as mockery of a 'liberal' white society underneath which lies pure racism. Interpretations could go on and on. And it's a beautiful thing for a horror movie.",

The subtle (yet to many of us... not so subtle) symbolic images and coded dialogue give this movie layers that after only one viewing one cannot decipher without the discussions one will have with friends and relatives.  Those discussions will be what make this movie a classic.

The judgement that this film is \"white people are evil propaganda\" on behalf of a white or a black/brown/tan/yellow person is exactly what makes this film a piece of genius material. \n\nThis is indeed a suspense thriller though not necessarily scarily. Milton \"Lil Rey\" Howery, who plays the leads cousin, is a show stealer. This guy is so funny! I laughed before he could get his full sentences out. \n\nI have said it before but Keith Stanfield is one to watch. I think that he is gonna prove to be a very good and popular actor in the future. His ability to adapt to different characters is impressive. \n\nOverall, this one is a little above average. Definitely worth the money and time. I gave it a bit of a higher score because it is doesn't fit into the \"stereotypical\" black experience story or over-cooked romance Or soap inspired drama Or overrated religious flick.

It is great because of the outstanding acting performances by Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams. BUT! It does not have a very culminating and overwhelming climax, and it would seem that Daniel Kaluuya's Chris got out way to easy. It was basically a joke that the white people who captured him actually believed that they could keep him there. Not to mention the light innuendo of racism that Jordan Peele had in mind when screenwriting. But not towards blacks, but towards whites. By showing that black people like Chris are constantly humiliated by white racism, he is making middle class white liberals out to be the bad people. Since Chris also only socializes to the black groundskeeper and black housemaid, Peele is clearly trying to introduce the feel of segregation not only in this movie, but in this world overall. Great horror, humor, and acting, but terrible theme, interpretation, and opinion of African American victimization.",

The feeling I got watching  the opening scene was one that made me realize why we go to movies, then it just fizzled away just as quickly as it came. \n \nThe movie was very slow moving with just enough it keep me from loosing interest and looking at Alison Williams, was a huge help to keep my eyes on the screen i must add. However with that said, the movie was not bad at all, i just didn't see the horror in the film. \n\nIf you watch this movie it won't be a waste of your time, but the amount of action, or the climax of this movie is peanuts compared to the build-up, other than the one part that i felt was very cheesy, and I thought it was outdated in movie production,  you will find this movie to be interesting at the least, and if you hold out until Redbox or Netflix you won't be missing out on much. I suggest catching a matinee if you must go and watch  Get Out in theaters, it will be worth the discounted ticket cost.",

But it turned out to be a very solid horror flick.\nThe main actor, Daniel Kaluuya, I had only seen on the English show Black Mirror (which is incredible by the way) so seeing him in this type of American role was quite a shift. He does extraordinarily well, showing a wide range of different emotions. And finally I can report that an accent was done well! I never heard him drop out of it.\nRace definitely plays a big role, but it's not presented in a vicious way. It more just shows the constant foot-in-mouth moments of white people when they're around African Americans. Rather than a hateful approach to the divide, it takes an honest route and pokes fun at it. The movie's theme and underlying story of course go deeper than this, showing the first time director's ability to get this across without just having the white people shouting the n word to show us they're the villains.\nA smart, creepy, and satisfying social commentary. 8/10.",

However, about two thirds of the way through, the movie went from interesting to completely bonkers. There's a revelation involving brain surgery that...well, it's a little bit too ridiculous, and made it difficult to take the film seriously from that point on. It's certainly an entertaining twist, but it did rather go against the tone the rest of the movie had set.

Race is discussed so brilliantly in this movie and in a way that made this film even scarier. Some directional choices managed to sky-rockett some of the scenes, while the performances managed to create the desirable atmosphere. The last act was weak though and although that's where most of the horror took place that's where the film's weaknesses lie. I personally feel that the social/racial documentary was this film's greatest strength, and while focusing there Peele managed to create the suitable background for the sotry he wanted to tell. The result by the end, was really weak though.",

Well luckily, Get Out succeeds at blending these elements will to bring tension through the 103 minute runtime.\nDaniel Kaluuya as Chris plays a mid 20s photographer going to meet his girlfriend Rose's family for the weekend, but quickly realizes he becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the questions Rose's family asks him and he begins to discover even more.\nWhere this film succeeds is playing in the racial undertones in a not over the top way. It lends itself that much more to the tension Chris feels when he finds out why he's truly here (don't worry I won't spoil it). There are a handful of scares, but get easily settled with great laughs, particularly Lil Rel Howery as Rod who delivers a handful of the biggest laughs in the movie.\nSome will say Get Out has a \"agenda\", but at its core, it's a successful thriller that never once falls off nor loses track of its goal and I'm hoping we see more films by Jordan Peele.",

Trust me when I tell you that this movie is full of surprises and the trailers don't give away anything. It wastes no time in getting really weird, and ratchets up the tension every step of the way. The way the mystery unfolds and the pacing and timing of the reveals is expertly done. First time director Jordan Peele nails the genre and flips it on its head, using comedy sparingly - but at the most perfect moments to cut the tension. It's unique in its portrayal of the black experience and its commentary on underlying liberal racism and how it manifests itself. It's the kind of movie that causes outbursts of laughter and exclamation and applause, and seeing it in a crowded theater only enhanced that participatory experience. I was semi-skeptical going into this because I knew so little about it, but it ended up being one of the most surprising movies I've seen in recent memory. It definitely lives up to its 99% on Rotten Tomatoes - and fuck that one asshole critic that gave it a bad review just to bring it down from 100. This is damn near perfect.",

            "content": "Wait, did I see Jordan Peele's name attached to this horror movie as the director? Yes, yes I did. Get Out marks the famous comedian's directorial debut in the form of an interesting take on the horror-thriller genre. And it's a debut that pays off immensely.\n\nFor those that have seen the trailers for Get Out, you know that it focuses on a young couple consisting of a black man and a white woman as they venture out for a weekend trip to meet her parents. After they arrive, the young black man, Chris, played by Daniel Kaluuya, feels uncomfortable in the primarily white environment of her parents' household, and even more uncomfortable as strange things begin to happen in the house. Those strange things quickly become sinister, and Chris is forced into a terrifying fight for his life as he tries to \"get out.\" Now, some of the biggest standouts of the film are the performances, particularly that of the little-known Kaluuya and several of the main supporting actors (like Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford, who play the parents, Allison Williams, who plays his girlfriend rose, and Betty Gabriel, who plays their black maid Georgina). All of these performances contribute to a genuinely creepy and unnerving atmosphere set up during the first half of the film. The way the film executes Chris' uncomfortable predicament of being a black man in a sea of white folk is brilliant, making us as an audience feel genuinely unsettled. It almost does not even need the more traditional horror-film aspects, like jump scares and creepy music, to create this atmosphere. It is marvelously well-done, making the majority of the first half of the film tense and freaky. As the secrets and events of the plot begin to unfold over the course of the film, the creepy and unsettling tone gives way to a much more intense thrill-ride, one that is, again, executed fantastically. Many of the shots induce audible reactions, nail-biting tension, and applause-worthy relief, giving way to a satisfying ending to a satisfying film.\n\nGet Out, in short, works as both a social commentary on situations like the one Chris is in and an excellent horror-thriller film. Some other note-worthy things to mention are the comedy sprinkled throughout the dialogue that helps relieve some of the unsettling feelings I had. The cinematography was another praiseworthy aspect of the film: shaky-cam was utilized effectively on occasion, and there were many beautiful shots especially near the beginning of the film that provided great additions to the set-up. But anyway, Get Out is a fantastic horror-thriller film and a promising step in Peele's career as a filmmaker. It gets 5/5 stars.",

For me, that wasn't  enough for such a long beginning. \n\nThen it did get interesting, with the guy getting kidnapped, the freaky black servants, and crackpot neighbors. The whole hitch of the plot, however, missed in its foundation. I won't give it away, but they could have tied it to a more historical beginning, more than just familial and scientific. They could have gone the American history route, to be specific, the African American slave-times history route. That would have been something!\n\nThe ending left me saying, \"That's silly.\" To me, it was your typical thriller/horror type ending, kind of a cop out.

However, it's not exactly terrifying and perhaps is best described as a psychological thriller than a true horror film.\n\nIt remains, however, pretty entertaining (Rod!) and takes you on a bewildering ride that is sure to get you to react, somehow. Sure, the music might not be the best (despite the horror genre seemingly relying on cheesy SFX) and even too overt, but Peele has done an incredible job of creating an ever-escalating experience with a smaller budget.\n\nDefinitely worth a try.\n\nEdit: Increased for its rewatch value.

The anxiety of trying to impress them, the background history or even the appearance can make you feel a little nervous. Director/writer Jordan Peele first film and tackling a horror genre at that makes a pretty entertaining movie. He definitely has his work cut out as a director by making the one thing couples usually have an anxiety about and twisting it around.\n\nThe film follows Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) are planning a small trip to visit her parents. He is afraid they will judge him for being a black guy. They arrive at their country side house, were Chris notices that there is a black guy doing work on their yard or a house maid. Which her parents assure him that they are not prejudice. When his girlfriends mother does an hypnosis session with him. He notices that everyone there may not be who they say they are.\n\nGet Out is a great suspenseful horror movie. It may not be scary or bloody. It does build the mystery suspense. The moments of Chris noticing the strange behaviors that the house maids are behaving. Her parents behaviors being erratic and cheery and creepy about meeting him and introducing him to other guests in a big party. The concept of hypnosis is also pretty crazy as Chris starts questioning if its his paranoia self about fearing about being judged for his race or if something sinister is going on. Jordan Peele does well building the suspense and the anxiety with a white family having black people as maids.\n\nI was very surprised about how awesome this movie was. I had low expectations after watching the trailers and was thinking it would be a cheesy bad acting horror movie. Jordan Peele proved the expectations wrong. It turned out to be a smart suspenseful movie were you root for the main character. Which is rare to see characters make certain decisions which can be frustrating in most horror movies.\n\nThere is a twist that is best not to reveal or talk about. The less you know or see from the previews the better the surprise will be. The last act and the ending does not disappoint. The movie does have some funny moments and plus a comic relief character that is Chris friend that is always throwing jokes about sex slaves and only trusting the \"brothers\" of his kind.\n\nDaniel Kaluuya did great which this is my first time seeing him perform on screen. Allison Williams did well as his girlfriend. Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener both were great and creepy with their characters.\n\nOnce the twist is revealed, it can be kind of disturbing about whats really going on. Without giving much away. Overall, Get Out is a great horror film. Director Jordan Peele may have a great start working on films. The suspense and funny moments were well balanced. The twist was surprising. The cast and acting were great. The plot and concept of interracial meeting the family and paranoia was entertaining. I definitely recommend the film if you are looking for suspense",

Aside from having many stereotypical talking points, this was really quite a unique horror, unpredictable, humorous, vaguely gruesome in parts and perfectly staged into a climatic ending. Ultimately it's about a girl introducing her new boyfriend to her parents, and you sense that the film is going to be about them turning against him because he's black. This isn't the case though, so that part is cleverly deceiving, and hides the truer meaning of the storyline. Horrors are normally so obvious and littered with cliche's, but you're left feeling dumb when you realise this film has actually made a fool of its audience in producing a twist ending that no one saw coming. It teases us into knowing there are some strange goings on, yet never revealing the full identity of proceedings until the closing moments. At which point, you leave the cinema on an all time high, applauding the producers for their cunning plot. It has a few jumpy moments which you try to play cool, but fail ridiculously, a new looking but very professionally acted cast, and the odd look away scene where you are always left wondering why people have to die in the most bluntest of fashions. Can they just be shot? No, they have to have something impaling them through their eye ball, or rammed into their mouth. That's not a complaint, but just an amusing trait of these films which makes them totally over the top and adorable. I'd definitely recommend this one as its compelling and weird at the same time, making it one of the most novel films of the year, so 'Get Out' there and get in to that cinema :)",

The movie is a horror film in a way thats full of suspense, but ultimately a satirical look at race and how people long or act toward one another. The film follows a young photographer named Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) who along with his girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) are visiting her parents together for the first time. Chris is concerned that Rose hasn't told her parents Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener) that he's a black dude. Chris' best friend Rod (Lil Rel Howery) brings up that he shouldn't go at all since this never ends well (foreshadowing!) Rose see's no concern and they go along on their trip. When they reach her parents house Chris immediately notices some strange things. The help at home are all black people and they act incredibly strange. Rose's younger brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones) who acts very strange. Soon enough Chris is caught up with Missy and her hypnosis which brings him to a strange place called the under. Chris excuses the strange behavior, but soon enough more and more alarming things begin to happen. I'll leave the plot alone there. What I've gone over you can pretty much see on the trailers for the film. The film has a really great kind of method of putting people in Chris' shoes. You see first hand the racism that he encounters at a party with people asking him questions about his strength, or about his \"culture.\" It moves with the story, but the truth is this could have easily been a real life situation for most young black males. The social commentary mixed in with the suspense and horror of the film really mix well. Overall, I was impressed by this one and would definitely recommend giving this one a look!",

The acting plays a big role too -- by giving us a range of visceral emotion to subdued reactions and responses, the lead performance shines above all the other quality ones on display.\n\nIt's a genre entry that isn't only ace in that regard, but also incorporates layers of vital messages (stealing of black culture, progressive racism, etc.) with keen imagery peppered throughout.

Sort of a cross between \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" and \"The Stepford Wives\", \"Get Out\" centers around a black man who's dating a white woman and when she takes him to meet her parents, the mom and dad start to develop strange behavior around the black man because he's in an interracial relationship with their daughter.\n\n\"Get Out\" is an intelligent, scary, funny and effectively creepy thrill ride that will make a perfect viewing for any black person who's afraid of police officers and the Trump era. The parents here aren't exactly presented as racists but you will still puzzled and afraid by them anyway. I don't know how Jordan Peele came up with this idea or convinced the studio executives that this concept would make for a great horror flick but he has accomplished the impossible with this film. Even though the year is early, \"Get Out\" is one of the best movies I've seen this year so far.\n\nThe film follows an African-American photographer named Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) as he and his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) go on a weekend trip to meet the parents. Chris quickly gets nervous about meeting Rose's parents because it might get uncomfortable and they might be concerned about their daughter dating a black man. When he does meet the parents, Dean and Missy Armitage (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener), they both seem like nice people with Dean even explaining that he would've voted for Obama if he had to serve a third term. \n\nThe parents introduce Chris to their maid (Betty Gabriel) and groundskeeper (Marcus Henderson) and he immediately notices their strange slave, zombie-like behavior. Dean and Missy seem to be developing strange behavior as well as they ask him questions about his smoking addiction and his late mother. When Missy offers to hypnotize Chris to cure his smoking habit, he thinks that there might be a link between Missy's hypnotizing and the slave-like behavior in the maid and the groundskeeper. \n\nWith a heightened sense of fear, Chris calls his best friend and TSA officer Rod Williams (Lil Rel Howery) for help and he tells him about the unusual behavior that surrounds Rose's parents and their maid and groundskeeper. When Rod looks up online about a months-old disappearance of another black man, Andre Hayworth (LaKeith Stanfield), he warns Chris to get out as fast as possible.\n\nThe ending gets a little predictable and soft but nevertheless the big twists in this movie are chilling and the satire works like clockwork. Writer and director Jordan Peele has crafted a horror film that's both clever, witty and stylish. The performances from Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are all terrific. Kaluuya is the key to the movie because he walks an intense tight-rope of being both charismatic and psychologically afraid.\n\nEven though it's a Blumhouse Production, Jordan Peele doesn't fall for any of the usual genre trappings and he goes all the way with his story which has echoes to classic Hollywood thrillers. \"Get Out\" is a near-perfect horror film that takes the issues of racism, slavery and other social topics and blends them together to make a biting satire of the black man's fear of the white man.",

He is also a huge movie buff, so I was anticipating on seeing many gorgeous shots and camerawork. What I had hoped coming in is what I got coming out, and then some. This film will go down as one of the most important cultural films not just for the Horror genre, but for movies as a whole. The narrative and meaning behind every metaphor and ugly truth is eye-opening, and I feel like we are at the start of a renaissance for black filmmakers. The entire cast was absolutely fantastic, the writing was incredible, and Jordan Peele's direction deserves a standing ovation for a first time filmmaker. We have seen the birth of two new stars in Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams, and Lil Rel Howery might've been the biggest surprise to me. He provided the much-needed comedic effect to this very tense film. I will be absolutely shocked if this film isn't nominated for at least two Academy Awards. I was floored walking out of the theater, and I believe Jordan Peele has what it takes to be the next great Director.",

            "content": "I wouldn't have expected someone with their background fully entrenched in comedy to be the main  advertising draw behind a horror movie, but here we are. Following on the heels on his work in Key and Peele and the sometimes-funny-but-overall-disappointing Keanu from last year, Jordan Peele has often been overshadowed by Keegan-Michael Key, but with Get Out, his talents as a storyteller, filmmaker, and satirist display themselves wonderfully. Not only is this one of the most fun movies in recent memory, but it's a brilliant use of the horror genre and its formula and tropes to deliver a biting, twisted racial satire without ever even running the risk of coming off as angry or preachy. It's tense and hilarious in equal measure, making for a Cabin in the Woods-type ride that gradually morphs itself into something crazy \u00e0 la an Edgar Wright film. Chris (Daniel Kaluuya of the \"Fifteen Million Merits\" episode of Black Mirror) and Rose (Allison Williams) are a couple going to visit her parents (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) for the weekend. She hasn't told them that Chris is black and he's dreading the inevitable awkwardness that will arise from the situation, but she reassures him that they aren't racist. When they all meet, the family seems normally awkward and stilted with dad jokes and a weird younger brother, but Chris is intrigued by their disconcerting black housekeeper Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and the few other black people that he has uncomfortable interactions with. He grows from wary to suspicious of the parents, and to say anything else would likely ruin the experience. The horror genre has been done from so many angles, ranging from lazy and clich\u00e9d (endless remakes) to meta and subversive (Scream, The Cabin in the Woods), and the revisionist approach of those included in the latter category often employ a feminist slant. With Get Out, though, the sense of being the \"other\" is the core of the film. Instead of the male gaze, we experience the white gaze. Instead of having a final girl, we have a final black man. Instead of casual and unintentional misogyny from characters due to ignorance, there's casual and unintentional racism. The discomfort and anxiety is firmly rooted within a viewpoint too often neglected in mainstream movies, and while Jordan Peele's sense of humor is often palpable and makes it a very fun viewing experience, it never strays into parody. This is laser-focused, tonally coherent satire with tricks up its sleeve. We see the humor in how stilted white people can be; there's no denying that behavior typically seen as \"bougie\" can be off-putting. In addition to cringe-humor, here's also a sense of horror inherent to social anxiety, and this movie fully understands that. This movie doesn't take easy potshots at racism. This family isn't a redneck conservative backwoods type. The mother is a psychiatrist and the father is a neurosurgeon, and the latter has an undying love for Obama. Get Out finds the institutionalized racism that's infected society and then laughs at it with a shrug while maintaining a political but welcoming tone. Comic relief, namely from the work of Lil Rel Howery as Rod, Chris's best friend who is a TSA agent, is the type of accessible humor that's nearly impossible to dislike. The movie's commentary sneaks up on you like a monster in the woods and then gives you a friendly nudge on the shoulder, and the progression of the script and the increasing insanity of what unfolds doesn't let you off the hook. My only issue with Get Out is that it doesn't really have a specific look to it. Other than a few moments of surrealist imagery that reminded me of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World or Under the Skin, oddly enough, the film is pretty generic in color schemes and how it's shot. The visual style is definitely the weakest link here, and really the only flaw that I can think of. Otherwise, this is the best movie that I've seen in months, and it's definitely the best movie of 2017 so far. I'd be really surprised if this didn't make it on my top 10 list come December. 9.2/10, amazing, A, far above average, etc.",

Most horror films do not have that much going, so, for a first-time feature film, Get Out is especially impressive. Perhaps the horror itself is not too frightening upon full realization, but the presentation will be enough to give you the perspective of Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), a black man about to visit his white girlfriend Rose's (Allison Williams) prestigious and even whiter family. Regarding the theme and premise, I do not feel fully comfortable in saying that Get Out offers Chris' full perspective. For Rose's family, it is not enough to welcome black people into their culture. They must literally be able to become black people. This film leaves quite an effective mark in contemporary American society, where many media outlets fail to integrate cultures in a respectful manner. Blatant white supremacy is a dying problem, but the secret supremacy lives on. That is what Rose's family represents, and we see Chris experiencing the extremities of feeling out of control, helpless to the strings of someone with more power, aggravated with how near impossible it seems to share compassion with the more privileged. Mainstream audiences are not often blessed with films like this. This is nice. Bonus points for an interracial sex scene (seriously, I cannot remember the last time I saw a black man and white woman have sex in a film that was not porn), as well as the comedic chops of Bradley Whitford, Catherine Keener, and LilRel Howery.",

This is like the STEPFORD WIVES of the 2010s, where everything you want to believe about your friends & neighbors, post-election, comes into question. Can I believe what you are saying to my face, or is there insidious race rage beneath the surface? One of the few films of recent memory to successfully satirize white liberal race fetishization, and to do so while leaving the audience cheering.",

            "content": "Get Out is the directorial debut of Jordan Peele, and it stars Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Bradley Whitford, and Catherine Keener in a horror film about an interracial couple that is going to see the girlfriend's family, but the issue being, her family doesn't know the fact that her boyfriend is black which certainly got them surprised, and when Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) starts going around the house and sees the people that he met, he starts to get a little suspicious around the place that he's in. Knowing the fact that this is the first film that Jordan Peele has directed and is a horror film, is enough for me to be interested in, and I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD so that I can rent it. Now that I finally got to watch it, Get Out is definitely worth the wait. The acting is fantastic as I haven't seen the main actor in anything which he did great of acting scared and giving out emotional scenes. I finally got to see Allison Williams in something as I kept hearing about her in Girls, and she's great also, and I do like the ambiguity of Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener as you're not quite sure about what they are, and it's really nice to see them in this as I haven't seen them in a while. The actor that stole the show surprisingly, is Lil Rel Howery as almost every time he's in this, he makes me crack up so much that I can definitely tell that this is Jordan Peele's comedic side in what he sees in his horror elements. I had no idea where it's going, and the scares in this are effective. The characters are likable and memorable, and the climax is crazy in an exciting way. It's really funny in a way that the awkward jokes have the advantage here towards a racial thing going on as white people in this don't know how to talk to the main character, and you feel just as awkward as he is, but in a funny way. There's never a moment that I thought was dumb, and the ending is very good, which there was an alternative ending that was Jordan Peele's original intention, and that was pretty good too. It's thought-provoking, and it gets by the message pretty clear in a subtle messed up way. Get Out is a very strange film that's really original, and is definitely one of those films that I'll watch again.",
