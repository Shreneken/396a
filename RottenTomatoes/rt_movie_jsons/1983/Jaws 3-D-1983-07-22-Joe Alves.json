    "summary": "After a young great white shark finds its way into a sea-themed park managed by Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett Jr.), workers try to capture it. But the facility's attempt to keep the shark in captivity has dire consequences: A much larger mother shark appears in search of its offspring. Among those who must battle the angry aquatic killing machine are marine biologist Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong), her co-worker Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid) and a pair of friendly dolphins.",

            "content": "Firstly, the 3D effects were impressive for their time, and they still hold up fairly well today. It was fun to see the shark leaping out of the water and towards the audience, but beyond the gimmick, the movie lacked substance.\n\nSecondly, the acting was mediocre at best, with some cheesy lines and over-the-top reactions. While it was enjoyable to see Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr. on screen, their performances didn't quite save the movie.\n\nLastly, the plot was predictable and lacked depth. It was essentially just another shark attack movie, and the characters didn't have much development. While it was a decent watch for a lazy weekend, it wasn't particularly memorable or impactful.\n\nOverall, Jaws 3D was a decent movie that relied too heavily on 3D effects and didn't offer much else. It's worth a watch for fans of the Jaws franchise, but don't expect too much from it.",

The acting by the two main characters was actually ok but all the supporting characters were not good and marred with bad dialogue most of the time and generic characters overall. The cinematography is bad in this. A lot of the movie is just showing off SeaWorld at times, than the horrific special effects (I'm sure these looked terrible even in 1983) and the terrible out of place 3D shots which don't fit at all and murky hard to see underwater shots. Mix this in with boring uninspired basic shots and you get a bad combination overall. The music is ok and probably the best thing in this. The Jaws theme works but the rest is forgettable and generic. The editing is bad with no real flow at times of story and gives way to terrible pacing. The first 30 minutes are incredibly boring followed by a semi interesting shark capture and plot twist that makes no sense and a laughably bad ending shot with subpar scenes in between. Because of this its very hard to ever build any suspense and sustain it and makes for a very boring picture that you laugh at at times for how bad it gets towards the end. This isn't worth it at all. I didn't see this in 3D but I can't imagine that making a difference.",

Not real terrible because it falls into the \"so bad its good\" territory. But doesn't come close to matching the original 1975 film and doesn't even surpass the first sequel.

Even the second film was better, and while I would hardly call that film a masterpiece, it was watchable.\n\nOne major problem with this film is that it's dull, in my opinion that is. I wouldn't have minded so much the sluggish pace if the suspense and plot were up to par. Sadly, neither are. The plot is both unoriginal and close to being a non-event.\n\nThe suspense, tension and thrills were what made the original so memorable, there is next to none of that here. The music and direction do not help. The music feels very predictably placed sometimes which spoils the mood of the scene, and the direction feels pedestrian and tired.\n\nThe locations are pretty good, they're not what makes the film so dull and cheap visually. That's the fault of the slip-shod editing and the rubbish effects, with the shark completely lacking menace and feeling incredibly gimmicky. Jaws 3-D also has some cheesy and trite dialogue and superficial characters that you don't care for at all.\n\nThe acting is poor. Dennis Quaid has a badly-written character, and sadly in his performance he lets that show. The other actors are either bland or annoying.\n\nSo overall, while not as bad as Revenge the film is a big mess. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

I will say I didn't enjoy the plot, but only because it lacked something worth watching - it's poor, not terrible. More of the shark was wanted, but I would personally say that about the preceding two films as well.\n\nParts of this 1983 flick that are terrible, though, are the special effects, especially right at the end. There is also some poorly done green screen and it, clearly, has a dire cover. There's no doubting this being made was a cash grab, that's basically the only reason to ever go 3-D, but a cash grab doesn't necessarily mean it's an awful film; which this isn't, in my opinion. It's simply bad. The cover is hilariously awful though, granted.",

The shark doesn't seem that big at all because there is not attempt, apart from a moment near the end with a person in the shark's mouth, to really show the size of the shark in relation to anything relatable. There aren't many deaths. The in-you-face 3D moments are not very well done. The only positive was that it wasn't too boring, just about enough happened to hold my attention.

As for the ending scene where the shark breaks the glass, is without a doubt the worst scene in movie history. First of all, the shark in that scene looked like someone googled up a photo of a shark and edited it into the final cut. Also, when the shark brakes the glass shouldn't it have gotten pulled into the room with the other people, and not have just disappeared! On top all that, this was meant to be the climax of the movie! Truly nothing could truly be farther from a satisfying ending that could've made up for the horrible cinematography and poorly rendered CG that was the whole movie. Overall, I would like to hear from anyone who thinks this is even a slightly good movie because it deserves every bit of criticism that it got. You can't even take the trailer let alone the whole movie even slightly seriously and in my opinion is a truly dreadful 0/10 film!",

You barely even see the shark. And the end of the shark which were epic in the first movies was awful in this one. Logic is thrown out the window for this movie. THE SHARK SWIMS BACKWARDS!!!! If you didn't know sharks can't do that. And the shark is thirty feet long. And Apparently doesn't eat people just kills them because we see two dead bodies one a day after the shark attack one STILL IN THE SHARK'S MOUTH. And the one in the shark's moth is there even after another person is eaten. It's so bad! Also right before the main shark attack and death scene the main characters run into the shark and are rescued by dolphins without the trainer calling them. They just swam over where a deadly shark is and saved some humans. WHAT? Sorry I keep using all caps this movie is garbage. The characters aren't bad and the acting is fine I guess. The one good thing I can say about this movie is that it tried to do something different. But man did it blow it. Don't waste your time with this. It's so bad it goes past the point of it's so bad it's good. Because there is nothing good about this movie. If you're curious and want to laugh at the bad special effects, don't.

Now, you have to consider this has been decades since it was first released. You also have to give credit due to Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong for making a likable pair. It was a good idea for having the shark based in Sea World. The only problem is it was Joe Alves first movie, and given that it was in 3-D. Not so well...most of the shots look dark. They can be creepy but a little hard to tell what's going on. The shark looked the best I think, giving that it had rows of teeth and you can see it from the inside of the sharks jaws.  Even whites of her eyes. But I think this movie flounders with the aspect of it. They showcase the 3-D, \"way...too...much.\" The dialogue doesn't make sense unless you have subtitles on. About the time the shark gets going, we've already spent forty-eight minutes waiting on it. Not really any attacks, but I think that was a good thing. It made the shark kind of pick and choose who to do next. From there on, it's a decent follow up. It was decidedly good, until it rammed the undersea lab. Not sure if they didn't have money or what, but both that and a couple effects weren't that well handled. I've read the script, and they cut about fifteen minutes out of it. It made it more dialogue heavy, but Hollywood always goes for the budget constraints of more people in the seats with slimmer budgets.

Well with Jaws 3 (3D on cinematic release in 1983) I had one of those moments.\nThe eighties were to result in several of these appalling films. (Grease 2, Superman IV, several Cannon films)\nThe premise is quite frankly laughable. \nYou have a water based 'Seaworld' theme park on the East Coast of the US.\nA Great White Shark enters the lagoon or man made lake of the park from the ocean via the gate that supposedly separates them.\nIt later becomes apparent that a second, far bigger shark (it's mother) is also at large in the park.\nCharacters include the grown up sons of Chief Brody from the first two Jaws films.\nThe park owner Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett Jr), Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid),  a marine biologist Dr. Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong) and two British actors Simon MacKorcindale and P.H. Moriarty.\nDiscerning British viewers may recognise Moriarty from the likes of The Long Good Friday and Scum.\nMacKorcindale from the BBC TV drama Casualty.\nFor its cinema release the film was called Jaws 3D and required the viewer to wear some naff cardboard glasses.\nWhen watching the 2D version as I did it becomes apparent at certain points that objects come flying toward the camera for the 3D effects.\nThe special effects are poor by modern standards and add to the inadvertent comedy of a film that was released as a horror/suspense production.\nCertain scenes again made me laugh to myself at quite 'gory' moments such as characters being eaten showing their view inside the 35 foot mother sharks mouth.\nWhere as the direction of Steven Spielberg in the first film and it's music by John Williams were great highlights this film relies on a novice director Joe Alves who is out of his pardon the pun, depth.\nThe music being scored by Alan Parker with only elements of Williams Jaws theme.\nA film that with a better director and better script could have been so much better  (it can't be much worse?).",

This time, son of the Brody family Mike (Dennis Quaid) works for SeaWorld along with his marine biologist girlfriend Kay(Bess Armstrong).  His younger brother Sean pays a visit for continuity reasons from the first two films and he takes a liking to water skier Kelly (Lea Thompson).  Lou Gossett Jr joins the cast as the park's owner Calvin who has a bizarre Cajun/ Creole/ Caribbean (not sure) accent.  After a great white shark swims into the park's man made lagoon, a park employee gets eaten along with two coral poachers.  Mike and Kay investigate the disappearance of their coworker and discover a baby great white shark.  Instead of killing it, they decide to capture and keep it in captivity to boost park ticket sales.  The park opens and the baby shark dies.  Then the body of their missing coworker appears in front of some park guests in their undersea tunnels.  However, he seems to be attacked by something much larger than the baby shark.  It's 35 foot long mother who shows up right on queue to reek havoc on the park, terrorizing water skiers and park guests by trapping them in the undersea attraction.  Mike and Kay must now rescue the people trapped and kill the shark while Calvin ponders the huge lawsuits bound to follow this disaster.\nOriginally filmed and released in 3-D under the title \"Jaws 3D\" then changed to \"Jaws III\" for video and TV.  This film suffers from poor special effects, a paper thin plot and not enough shark mayhem.  If they would've focused more on reviving the disaster film genre from the 1970s then this entry in the series may have been fun.  Instead, it's slow, talky and what ever little action and suspense it does have is preposterous.  This shark can swim backwards, remain still in the water and even snarl even though sharks have no vocal chords.  If you think \"Jaws 2\" was a bit of a bore during the second and third acts, then you'll think this entry is even more sluggish.  Skip this film and just watch the original.",

In fact my 3 star rating would be reduced further were it not for it's kooky 3D effects which in of themseleves are far more entertaining than much else that the movie has to offer. \n\nThat said, it's almost unfair to call this movie bad when the movie was designed purely to serve the 3D rather than the other way around. The movie knows exactly what it is and never pretends to be anything else. In fact I'll be brave and say its not actually a bad movie when viewed in its intended form and taken as tongue-in-cheek as clearly intended.\n\nIn 2D though, it's a much flatter experience in every sense. For a start the badly composited process shots look much worse and completely lose their novelty factor. In 3D you actually look forward to seeing them!\n\nThe 3D is so dominant and the depth so amped up that you are never allowed to forget for one second that you're watching a 3D movie. Even ardent 3D fans may find it headache inducing eventually. The script is mostly forgettable but it does have its moments and generally the cast do okay to work with what they have.\n\nOne interesting thing to note is that most of the shark footage (except for a few strange looking bad processed shots) looks good. \n\nOverall, in its 3D form it's a fun B movie that goes well with a bag of popcorn, a couple of alcoholic drinks and a few friends.\n\nThe big achievement of the 3D version is it's ability to leave you with a guilty smirk on your face by the end.\n\n In 2D, it loses most of it's charm and any real reason for existing.\n\nThe third dimension in hilarity.",

Well almost 30 plus years later I recently saw it on Bluray in 3D, on a 60 inch TV. \n\nI enjoyed the movie, its a typical 80's cheesy movie. If the movie had been edited a little tighter it would actually be a good film. The reason the film is in my memory is because the directors sister used to be a secretary for my father, and from memory the director was on the run at the time for legal reasons. Anyway back to the movie, it does drag in places. However watching the in your face 3D is enjoyable and brings back childhood memories of just how great the 80's really were I need Doc Browns Time machine to just spend a few weeks there, and to get an opportunity to have the big hair and shoulder pads. Its basically Jurassic Park in the water, a theme park that goes wrong and people die, pretty simple really. Watch it and enjoy it for what it is good old plain cheesy fun.

The shark looked awful real for the most part and the music was decent. Some of the new 3D graphics though looked pretty unrealistic (yet it was filmed in 3D at the time) and the ending could\u00e2??ve probably been redone with a better idea. Some other plus sides though, it was fun to see Mike and Sean Brody in this continuation on another frightful adventure as Mike is an employee at the park and Sean more afraid than ever of the water. The film is enjoyable enough in my opinion, but probably my least favorite out of the series.",

Making a second sequel and turning that standalone film into a franchise.  So it is with the \"Jaws\" franchise with the release of \"Jaws 3\".  And while some single films have found success in becoming franchises, the same cannot be said for \"Jaws\".  \"Jaws 2\" was a disappointment, but \"Jaws 3\" is a whole new level of bad.\n\nThe biggest problem with \"Jaws 3\" is that it takes place at Sea World.  As such, it is less about the shark, and more about the park.  There is one decent scene where the shark attacks a bunch of people at the Sea World opening day event.  Other than that, it goes long periods without a shark attack.  As a result, the film is also less about suspense and more about...well I don't know what.\n\nI think it speaks volumes about this film that its big gimmick was being in 3D, yet there are some truly awful visual effects.  It's a film that cannot deliver on its promises.  It's just one of many problems that \"Jaws 3\" has.  Even the things it does well - like the twist that there are two sharks - are ruined because they end up not being utilized well.  \"Jaws 3\" is just a really boring film; one lacking the fun and suspense of the original \"Jaws\".",

No actors from the previous films were cast. The film was released in 3D, but the unlike its predecessors the critics did not like it. I, on the other hand, was able to enjoy it. Agreed, the storyline is not that complicated and it does take long before we get to see the shark in action, but I do like the fact that it takes place in a sea-world theme park. And yes, the special effects are a bit cheesy. A good suggestion for a night of brainless entertainment.  \n\nMichael Brody (Quaid) works with his girlfriend Kathryn in Florida's Sea-World. When Michael's younger brother Sean comes on a visit, they plan to have a good time together. But when a man is found dead in the water, half eaten, they recognize the wounds as shark bites. A great white shark has made its way into the lagoon. With the help of famous TV hunter Philip FitzRoyce (MacCorkindale), the people of Sea-World are able to capture the animal, wanting it to exhibit it. The shark dies shortly afterwards. Kathryn and Michael are shocked when the learn that it was only a baby. Its mother must be nearby. And then Sea-World colors red as the gigantic monsters appears. Can they stop momma shark?",

Most of the people who have seen this movie have only seen it on home video and not in 3D, so the film winds up being an exercise in trying not to laugh your butt off at how bad it is. This time around, the film takes place at Seaworld, where a shark accidentally gets in and reeks havoc. Mike and Sean Brody are conveniently present for all of the shark's shenanigans and don't contribute a whole lot to the plot anyways. It's all about the 3D and the images jumping out of the screen at the audience to sell the gimmick. It's a shame too because it could have at least been on par with the previous sequel if they had just not gone with the 3D. All of that said, this film is indeed hilarious. The special effects and the 3D parts don't hold up and are laugh out loud funny, as is Louis Gossett Jr.'s terrible delivery of the dialogue. Actually, hardly anybody in this film delivers dialogue that's worth listening to, but that adds to the charm, so watch it to make fun of it only. Does it tarnish the Jaws legacy? No, but it's a terrible movie, but under the right cirumstances, you can have some fun with it.",

Looking at the writing credits you'd think the film had potential, with \"Jaws\" original screenwriter \"Carl Gottlieb\" and the brilliant Richard Matheson. However, the film is a mess, involving a great white shark eating people at Sea World. There's no real suspense, a complete lack of interesting characters, and just abysmal special effects.  In later interviews, writer Richard Matheson claimed that the film was bedeviled with script doctors that ruined the central premise of a white shark swimming upstream and becoming trapped in a lake. I think the only reason to maybe watch the film is to see Lea Thompson in her feature film debut and Dennis Quaid in an early role.",

            "content": "Ever since I was a little kid, I have always loved the first two Jaws films, and I remembered when I watched the less than stellar third and fourth films. I hated them both and for many years, I didn't watch them again until I recently got a nagging feeling to revisit these widely despised sequels, in the hopes of being able to salvage them for camp value as I have become quite fond of stupid, trashy films.\n\nThankfully, I was able to salvage Jaws 3, at least (Jaws: The Revenge is another story) and I must say that I had quite a lot of fun watching this utterly ridiculous, unintentionally hilarious, and completely inept film.\n\nThe plot follows the Brody brothers who are now grown up. Mike now has a girlfriend and works at Seaworld, while Sean...I don't remember what the hell he does, but anyways, he decides to visit Mike even though he has a petrifying fear of the water after the events of the first two films.\n\nSomehow, after getting through the gates, not one, but two Great White sharks have found their way into Seaworld and begin to raise hell among the staff and park visitors. But, park management wants to keep the sharks alive to have the first ever Great White kept in captivity, but things don't go according to plan and now Mike, his girlfriend, his incompetent boss, and a suave British guy must do everything in their power to take down these beasts.\n\nOriginally, Jaws 3 was going to be a comedy in the tradition of the National Lampoon's franchise, but Spielberg and some other higher-ups shot this idea down and what we got instead was a film that was even hokier than what it would have been had it stayed a comedy.\n\nThe acting is terrible across the board, even with talented stars like Dennis Quaid and strangely, Louis Gossett, Jr. who just came off the superb An Officer And A Gentleman two years earlier who plays the incompetent park manager. It's especially funny to watch the scene where Quaid's character tries to warn people about the shark by stealing a golf cart, crashing it, pushing people out of the way, and shouting almost incoherently into a bullhorn. All the acting is way over the top and the characters are idiotic and unintentionally hilarious.\n\nAs far as shark mayhem goes, there is a lot of it...and a lot of it is absolutely terrible special effects combined with shoddy remnants of 80's 3D effects to remind you of just how awful it looks. There's a lot of blood, people getting eaten, scenes of peril due to severe park negligence and idiocy, and more. It's all quite entertaining to watch as the ineptitude unfolds and you will be astounded and amazed by the shoddy special effects. The ending is also hilariously bad when the characters end up forgetting about the lives of others and are instead thrilled and happy to see the dolphins happily jumping in and out of the water.\n\nMost baffling of all is the Seaworld advertising, because the film is set there and constantly talks about attractions there. What company would want their business associated with people being eaten by sharks and being put into perilous situations like getting trapped under 40 feet of water in an enclosed space? What would the advertisements be like? \"Come experience Seaworld! The place where negligent management will insure that both our employees and park visitors will be put into life-threatening scenarios involving sharks and being trapped in underwater tunnels! Because here at Seaworld, we don't give a fuck about you.\" That's honestly what this advertising feels like, which is why it still baffles me.\n\nIn terms of its actual quality, Jaws 3 is a monumental train wreck of a film that has earned its scorn (Unlike Jaws 2 which is unfairly maligned). However, I will compliment the beautiful music by Alan Parker as probably the only legitimately good thing about the whole film. Only the most hardened veterans of crappy film-watching will be able to survive this film because the story is ridiculous and filled with strange advertising, the acting and dialogue are terrible, the special effects are stunningly bad, and it is incompetently made in almost every other area as well...and yet, I can't help but like it because of those reasons.",

(oooh!) even a reed gets bafflingly poked right into the lens, it's like they started running out of things to have pop out in 3D. The acting is of course awful, also the shark somehow looks even more fake than the one in the second film, which looked even worse than the one in the first, and  the plot is kinda silly brilliance, the shark this time gets loose in a sea world style undersea kingdom/amusement park and wreaks havoc amongst the visitors. The thing is about this film is, yes it's rubbish, but A. It's a good laugh, especially if your a bit drunk and watching with your mates, mostly for the amusing \"3D\" moments, and B. At least it's not Jaws: The Revenge. You also get unintentionally funny bits like Dennis Quaid, in a little episode, going insane trying to warn everyone about the shark and seemingly causing more havoc than the rubber beast, knocking over popcorn trays, knocking over commentators, crashing buggies, shouting truly incomprehensible dialogue, BLOO, BLEE, BLAH, GEDDOU DA WADA!!! it's hilarious, and you get the worst special effect ever in the last scene, when the astonishingly dodgily blue screened plastic shark fly's through the screen, it's amazing, just jaw droppingly bad looking, but also wonderful in it's sheer, blatantly cheap, poor quality. But really Jaws 3 is great fun for all the above reasons, an amusingly sincere and brilliantly cartoonish wonky relic from the early 80's red and green spec era of 3D.

Well, I suppose that's what happens when your director isn't even a director, but the production designer on the first two films, and I only mention the first two films because I'm dubious that Joe Alves also provided production design effort on this film, seeing as how most everything seemed to be CG. Actually, scratch that, because the sets looked real, and every other effect, whoah boy, were anything but. It all goes into creating the ridiculous cheesiness that ruined this film and, well, actually made it rather amusing, definately not to where it made it as good as decent, but decidedly to where it made the film laughable enough to only be passable , which isn't to say that the camp isn't the only thing to undeniably enjoy in this film, to a certain degree.\r\n\r\nI don't really want to call the film tense, because \"Jaws 2\", as well-done and chilling as it was, was still considerably less tense than \"Jaws\", and you better believe that with this cornball film with bad effects and the occasional limp action sequence, scares fall to the point of just about collapsing clean out of sight (That little bit with the bloated corpse they find in a water tank was pretty messed up though). However, whether it be because they were really forcing the in-your-face 3D or whatever, there is a degree of inspiration put into the action sequences, quite a few of which have their moments of play with the steadily-rising-intensity action methods found in the predecessors, and while this film is certainly not competent enough to absorb a whole lot of tension from that, there is an undeniable degree of engaging thrill in beholding some of these action sequences. Still, in between that, you get more than your fair share of cheesiness, though, quite honestly, not quite as much as I expecting. Don't get me wrong, this film is a mess and as dumb as a stump, but inspiration as palpable, as the film isn't totally inept, and while that typically means that a film of this type isn't even bad enough to be enjoyable, here, that moderate degree of inspiration in Joe Alves' direction, married with amusing ambitious misfire, gives the film a certain aura of charm, and certainly entertainment value. Certain spots are livlier than others, but on the whole, the film rarely limps out, keeping consistent with events made entertaining by Alves' livliness and charm, made all the stronger by some of our leads' pretty unexpectedly decent chemistry, which gives the film a bit more of a human touch. I went into this film expecting a disastrous display of inexcusably uninspired filmmaking, and while the screenwriters and producer seemed to go in with that type of sensibility, Joe Alves' directorial execution, while also more tremendously disastrous than not, has enough charming ambition and occasional inspiration at its back to carry this film past contempt. Still, make no mistake, this film is more disastrous than not, maybe not on the level I was expecting, and definately not on the level where it's beyond redemption through ambitious charm and mild inspiration, yet most certainly to where the film could never be anything more than mediocre, with flaws that fall well beneath mediocre.\r\n\r\nAs I said, the film does get surprisingly rather thrilling here and there, yet on the whole, not much in the way of consequence can be felt, and for numerous reasons, one of which being this film's decision to experiment with more effects than just those of a 3D nature. Now, this is 1983 for goodness' sakes, so I'm not asking for Michael Bay here, people, but really, many of these digital effects can not at all be excused for the cheesiness of their concepts and poorness of their rendering, and it doesn't help that the film will sometimes linger too long on the abysmal CG, as well as use CG in places where they could have very easily used immensely more convincing practical effects, and on a few occasions the practical special effects fail to be all that special. The film is a technical mess, yet don't go thinking that things slips all over the place only during the handful of points where they play up the technical value, because the real scariest thing in this film is the script, such as it is. Guerdon Trueblood's story concept is underwhelming enough, but in the story's structure and execution at the hands of Carl Gottlieb and Richard Matheson, it's a disaster, because as if \"Jaws 2\" was conventional enough, this film relentlessly collapses into embarassing cliche into embarassing cliche, with uninspired plotting and overlong, uninteresting filler, and it's made all the worse by paper-thin and sometimes exaggerated characters, as well as absolutely dreadful dialogue, two aspects that are, in and of themeselves, made worse by the acting, or at least most of it. As I said, no matter how messy the acting gets, there is undeniable chemistry throughout the lead cast, with the strongest chemistry resting between Dennis Quaid and John Putch, largely because they're both actually pretty decent in their roles, yet outside of them and, well, quite a couple of passables (Ooh, Simon MacCorkindale was so charmingly British), there a few performance that lack - pardon the choice of words - \"bite\", with Bess Armstrong particularly making her lack of presence all the more stinging with plenty of cheesiness in the line delivery. Still, when you get down to it, one of the most key culprits behind this film's failure is the very man who helped the film in transcending total dismissal, for although director Joe Alves graces the film with some ambition and some inspiration, he just can't hold things together on the whole, and crafts a film that may not be bad, though certainly isn't good, just plain bland. Yes people, with all of its couple of high spots and many low spots, one of biggest the definitive reflections of this film's is simply blandness, as the film is with no real rewarding value, but plenty of missteps, and at the end of the day, it's the latter that you'll notice more, no matter how much the few strengths keep the missteps from really destroying this film, thus leaving the final product to dance pretty close to the waters of all-out terrible.\r\n\r\nOverall, the film doesn't quite \"bite\" the dust (Speaking of cheesy), being saved largely with the help of inspired moments in Joe Alves' direction, which provides unexpected engagement value during the action sequences, as well as a consistent degree of ambitious charm that, when complimented by fair chemistry throughout the cast and married with charming cheesiness within ambitious misfire, creates a kind of entertainment value that really does save this film from total collapse under the weight of its flaws, which isn't to say that flaws don't go drowned out, because with shoddy technical and a relentlessly cliched and cheesily poor script - whose flaws goes pronounced in execution by a few campy performances - incorporating cringe-worthy moments amidst constant blandness, \"Jaws 3\"... or \"Jaws 3-D\", or whatever version you're spending your time not too wisely watching, is left drifting as an utterly forgettable, considerably unrewarding and altogether tremendously underwhelming forced third installment for the once promising blockbuster saga.\r\n\r\n2/5 - Mediocre",

Mike Brody, now played by a thirty year old Dennis Quaid. What bizarre condition does he suffer from that causes such rapid aging?\r\nA young Great White is captured and put on display in the park but, in a plot twist lifted from \"Gorgo\", it's gigantic mother turns up looking for baby.

The plot is really bad and uninteresting. No interesting characters, no memorable lines, nothing really stand outs from the plot. It's just really boring and the Whole Sea World setting makes it feel like a really bad advertisement for Sea World. The ending was just terrible as well, when our heroes escape you know what there main concern is, the Dolphins. The Dolphins have no importance to the plot and doesn't mention if any of the other characters are alive.  \r\n\r\nThe only redeeming quality is the music, mostly because the music doesn't talk and acts terribly. I'm serious when I say every time a person yells it sounds something like Taz from The Looney Tunes. The 3D gimmick doesn't work mainly because the DVD doesn't give you any 3D glasses and it looks really stupid. The camera work is really bad, you could clearly tell what parts were meant to be in 3D and the special effects are so bad there laughable. I literally saw a scene where Jaws was just floating slowly towards our characters, I reason I say floating is because Jaws doesn't move any part of his body.\r\n\r\nJaws 3 somehow manages to be just a boring movie. It's not unwatchable like some of the movies I watch, but it's certainly not worth your time.",

If you've seen 'Jaws' 1 and 2 you'd be expecting Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) to return, in 'Jaws 3' that is not the case. Instead Martin's sons Mike (Dennis Quaid) and Sean (John Putch) are the main characters here. I like how Spielberg touches on Sean's fear of the water as a result of the events that occurred in 'Jaws 2', but that's about it. The rest of the movie is really not that interesting or as suspenseful as the original 'Jaws' and 'Jaws 2'. I would not recommend this movie to anyone it was quite boring.",

            "content": "Mike Brody appears to be totally over the events that struck his family in his youth and now works in Florida's newest underwater attraction - Seaworld. His brother, Sean is less sure and never goes in the water - although a visit to see Mike and a new girlfriend help him confront his fear if not get over it. Meanwhile, something is picking off staff and swimmers getting Mike and the staff out on a shark hunt. They capture a small great white and take it into captivity, only for it to die when it is put in too small a tank. They think their problems are over until an examination of the bite marks on some bodies and they realize that the shark that did the killing is much, much bigger than the one they caught.\r\n\r\nI saw this film as a child but couldn't remember if it was any good or not - my childish fears may have made it scary even if the film was poor, so I decided to give it a go again recently. The first thing that struck me was the sheer rubbishness of the effects. In the original Jaws, Spielberg had hidden the shark as much as he could because the effects didn't work (and also therefore upping the tension); however here the makers just decide to show anything - a poorly superimposed image, a rubber shark, fake severed arms and so on - none of them are concealed, they are all shown up in all their rubbish glory. I could forgive it this due to its age but two other films had already managed to handle this issue before this film so I don't see why they went this route when it so clearly didn't work. Some shots are so bad that they could have been mistaken for being a spoof (witness the shark swimming towards the control room).\r\n\r\nOf course, after the poor effects the second thing that hits you is the laughable plot. True it is not as bad as part 4 in terms of plausibility but it is still pretty thin. No attempt is made to really give the characters any sort of, well, character and the very basic sea world plot just about manages to give the shark enough high profile feeding scenes to keep the film moving - just don't hold your breath for any logic or sense. In fact, the opposite is true and this film does deliver some moments that make you wonder what the writers were thinking when they conceived some of this stuff! The manner of Jaws' death here would be hilarious if it wasn't so darn pathetic. Even with the plot being poor the film should still have had at least a few moment of fear and tension - many of us fear being eaten alive so it isn't hard to draw on that, but this fails to have any tension or excitement to speak of. The effects suck a lot of this out - but a director who's name is listed in the dictionary alongside the work 'workmanlike' didn't do anything to stop the rot either.\r\n\r\nWithout characters the cast are set adrift with nothing to do - how Quaid must have envied Roy Schnieder in the first films, at least he was a good character. Quaid runs around the place, Armstrong screams, Putch broods, Thompson screams and Gossett tries to act tough in the middle of a script that gives him nothing to do. I don't blame the cast but I am disappointed that nobody mention how very bad taste it was to make a happy ending out of the dolphins surviving while so many other people had not!\r\n\r\nOverall this is just a bad film. I'm not a big one for lists so I'll not play that game here but it is pretty much without any value at all. The plot is poor, the effects are rubbish, the direction is weak, the script just a load of nonsense and there is a total lack of tension, thrills or excitement. The original is a classic and this film is further proof that sometimes classics should be just left alone.",

            "content": "Well one day I was on Thatguywiththeglasses.com watching some Nostalgia Critic episodes and a new one popped up for a review of Jaws 3. I was curious because I hadn't heard of that film before, so I watched the review. I had almost choked on one of the warheads that I was eating because I thought that Spielberg had something to do with it (at the time I had no idea that he wasn't the one who directed the second one). I ran to go check on my computer, and to my relief I found out that he had no relation to either of the films. Since I was almost stricken with grief, I decided that I had to rent a copy just to see it for myself. This film is proof that when a studio decides to release a sequel to a successful film and the director of the former film decides not to direct it then the studio should just not make a sequel, because their reputations and future successes will without a doubt begin to go down the tall slide of pure badness and severity. The idiots behind this idea must've had piggy banks flying around in their heads because no one would be so stupid as to ruin the reputation of a respected and masterful film. And as if it weren't enough, I hate it when movies use 3D, especially when it's used as a stupid stratagem in order to put more money in the studio's pockets. 3D is ok sometimes, like in How To Train Your Dragon, but here it's just an annoying and barbaric pile of hagfish guts.\r\n\r\nThe major failure in this film happens to be the special effects, which are so bad that they can't even match the effects of the first one, and all the first one had was an animatronic shark named Bruce. In fact, if they had just used Bruce from the original or the other shark from the second one then they would've been in the clear. But no, they had to try and use ingenuity and put crappy effects in the movie, which by the way wouldn't have been maturely developed until Young Sherlock Holmes was released. The new cast and crew starring in and working on the film didn't help to alleviate the mediocrity that the SFX had already given the film. The stars are all blatant cardboard cut outs of typical Hollywood clowns, and they are given roles that are either improbable or statistically ridiculous. Dennis Quaid gives it his all, but even he is in shambles as he tries acting like a real three-dimensional character. The director of the film, who happens to have been the production designer for the two previous Jaws films as well as the production designer for The Sugarland Express, doesn't seem to have the same grasp on the subject matter as Spielberg did. There's too much of an emphasis on making a special effects extravaganza instead of actually trying to make the film true to the mastery of it's source material (gee, does that sound familiar?). What's more is that the film is an embarrassment to the people who had a part in making it, and that's why people have to be careful what projects they work on. Oh, and there's one other small teeny tiny itsy bitsy little detail that they forgot in this film...IT WASN'T SCAAAAARRY!!!!!! How can you go from one of the greatest and scariest if not the greatest and scariest horror/thriller movie ever made to this pet project hullabaloo? One thing's for sure, once everyone saw this film they started saying, \"Well, I guess I can go in the water now.\" Oooh, but watch out for those fake sharks that seem to levitate even though there's a vacuum of the wet stuff pouring through an open window right next to them. If you haven't seen this film then don't bother doing so, because unlike some bad films that'll make you laugh because of their idiocy, this one will just make you mad, and trust me, you'll want to put the DVD in a toaster after seeing it. I almost did, but I had to return it. What a waste.",

            "content": "Jaws 3, People 0 was the original title for the tragedy, better known as Jaws 3-D.  It was actually planned as a comedy to parody the earlier movies in the series.  But somewhere down the line the studios changed their mind.  Too bad, because this movie is so bad, it actually is a comedy.  And it was this wonderful movie that started off Dennis Quaid's career.\r\n\r\nThe story tells about the continuing adventures of the Brody family and their tagalong shark.  Except this time, the main characters are the children of the family.  And according to the studio description, it's the great white shark that survived (I don't know how) the second movie, that is on their tail.  But now the shark comes with child and is a threat at Sea World, where the Brodys are at.  Honestly, this movie totally stinks and is as far away from the genius of the original as can be. It deserves a big 0.  Still, the movie is so bad that it is halarious, and I can't imagine it was not intended as a comedy.\r\n\r\nWe never actually see the shark(s) attack anyone.  Several times I was hoping it would.  Actually, I was almost begging it; please bite someone!  But this shark seems to not only have a sense of humor, but is blind too.  For example: In one scene, Dennis Quaid yells \"get out of the water! Shark in the water!\"  At this point in the film, no shark has been sighted yet.  The shark itself wakes up and says \"shark? where?\"  The shark comes up to the top of the water, notices waterskiers, speeds up to them and tags along right behind, probably wanting to be part of the team.  The waterskiers notice the playful fish, panic, and fall down all over the place.  This is where fishy could have a huge smorgasbord, yay!  But no, fishy is bored, so it decides to play over by the bumperboats instead.  Lea Thompson get bumped, receives a huge cut, starts bleeding, and again people are swimming all over the place.  The shark is bored yet again, not to mention half asleap, so it swims off to an underwater tunnel and bumps into it several times (probably trying to wake up) causing leakage and panic.\r\n\r\nHow do you even categorize or criticize this film?  First a blind shark that seems to swim up to its victims, but instead of attacking, smiles, says \"hi\" and then wants to play.  But if the people don't want to play, the shark may growl (literally) and play tag instead.  And when you have a character that has just escaped the flooding of the underwater tunnel who then turns around, starts running back yelling \"I need my wallet!\", you know you can't take it seriously.  I also read that there was a risk that Roy Scheider was going to be brought into this movie. He made sure that he was going to be busy filming \"Blue Thunder\" instead, so there was no risk that he would be part of this \"masterpiece\".\r\n\r\nFor some reason, Jaws3-D also inspired me to sing these lyrics to the tune of The Brady Bunch theme song:\r\nHere's a story, about two kids named Brody\r\nwho had problems with two big sharks of their own\r\nthey were cursed to star in the film\r\nthat sucked completely\r\nanother chapter of the tragic Brody Bunch\r\n\r\nThis movie looks like something a group of flunking students in movie production class put together with bad props, cheesy special effects and under the leadership of Ed Wood.  I would actually watch it again because I can't remember the last time I laughed so much.  I still wonder how in the world they got oscar winning actor Louis Gossett Jr. and oscar winning composer Alan Parker to even consider being a part of it.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who want something to laugh at, you'll enjoy this.  But for those who want a good movie, run away!  Far far away!",

            "content": "There have been a lot of 3D movies recently. Some of the ones that stuck out and helped drive the format, whether they were good or bad, are as follows: Avatar, Alice in Wonderland, How To Train Your Dragon, Clash of the Titans, Toy Story 3, and even the horrendous The Last Airbender. However, movies like Spy Kids 3D: Game Over prove, 3D wasn't always a cool trick or an easy way for studios to make a quick buck. It was once a format that was dorky, chintzy, and headache-inducing. Friday the 13th Part III and Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare were prime examples of the gimmick being cheap and unattractive, but the biggest abuse of the format is Jaws 3, better known as Jaws 3D.\r\n\r\nIt was only like that in theatres, since most home videos or TV stations couldn't replicate the 3D technology, so it comes off as someone leering at you when you're sitting down. Seriously, they try so hard to pass off a shot as 3D that I keep thinking the camera is going to bump into them like in Spaceballs. \r\n\r\nIn addition to that, the special effects are a joke. Steven Spielberg was disappointed with the shark puppet that he made up for the first Jaws, so he used other filming techniques to hide it until the film's climax. This heightened the terror and made Jaws one of the best horror films ever. Spielberg was not involved with any of the sequels that I can recall, so the filming techniques make it painfully obvious that the shark looks like a rubber pool toy (and with a shot where Jaws moves at the camera perfectly still and suddenly makes a glass pane appear and break, that's probably not a bad guess).\r\n\r\nI think I've spent enough time bitching about the amateurish effects and lack of 3D. Now I need to take on the characters and story. It takes place in Sea World as they're about to open a new underwater attraction. Jaws is interfering, so the staff and some of the park's financiers want to catch it. O_O That's a weird product plug. Why would you want to market your amusement park as having Jaws in it, the biggest man-eating shark in the world? That's like Disneyland advertising that they have a Tron attraction that is an actual grid that you download yourself into and fight for your survival through video games. It sounds cool, but 23 people died in the original Tron, and I'm expecting a much higher toll in Tron Legacy.\r\n\r\nThe characters that get the most screentime here are the Brody brothers, played by Dennis Quaid and John Putch; and their girlfriends, played by Bess Armstrong and Lea Thompson. \r\nThey are dull beyond reason. They tried to make these heroes more like real people, but I think the writing staff went out of their way to give them no personality at all. It's like watching Pokemon and having the animators dump mud on all the Pokemon except Pikachu and Meowth.\r\n\r\nI really don't have anything else to say. This movie doesn't deserve to be associated with 3D any more than Justin Bieber deserves to be associated with music. I have two more Jaws sequels to do this month, and they won't be done in any particular order. So next time, I will tackle Theodore Rex.

The effects are the absolute worst, ever!This is the grand \"so bad it's good\" movie. It's also intresting to see Dennis Quaid during his early years. Another positive I have is the setting, which takes place in SeaWorld. I find it quite odd that they chose SeaWorld, because I wonder how they'd advertise having Jaws in the park.

It receives two stars solely because it is so bad that it becomes enjoyable in its own campy kind of way.",

It's abundantly clear that Jaws 3 is a movie where the cast and crew had a great time filming, unfortunately, that fun doesn't transcend from the screen to the audience. Instead of a guilty pleasure, Jaws 3 comes off as tedious and laughable. Again, not laughable in a \"fun\" way, just laughable in a \"you have got to be kidding me\" kind of way. As much as I love Dennis Quaid, he doesn't really bring much to the role and neither does anybody else in this film. The only person I had a good time watching was Lea Thomspon's character. Not only do I have a huge crush on Lea Thompson (Back when she was cute in the 80's, she's getting kinda old now), but her character is the most fun character on screen. Anyway, this movie bored me to tears. It bored me so much that I felt it necessary to turn it off and assume that people get eaten by a shark in silly 3D effects.",

The dismembered body parts \"floating\" towards you in slow motion really aren't all that effective anymore. \n\nI had remembered that this film takes place at a water park, but I had completely forgotten that the water park happened to be Sea World!

By that time he (who is this time a she) has worked up quite an appetite, and proceeds to eat some tourists and employees at Sea World, in Florida. That park is the second biggest star of this movie, which is no match for ''Jaws'' but probably no worse than ''Jaws II.'' It's harmless but unsurprising.\r\n\r\nI had to read the production notes for ''Jaws 3,'' which opened yesterday at the Rivoli and other theaters, to realize that two of the nice young men in the story are supposed to be the sons of Police Chief Brody of Amity, who was played by Roy Scheider in the first two films. Mike (Dennis Quaid), who has certainly grown up quickly, is now chief engineer at Sea World, and his brother Sean (John Putch) has come to visit. Also on hand are Kathryn (Bess Armstrong), a spunky marine biologist who is having the underwater equivalent of an office romance with Mike. Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett Jr.), the park's supervisor, is around,too.\r\n\r\nNothing much happens to any of them during the film's first hour, which revolves around the capture of a reasonably harmless great white shark hardly bigger than a station wagon. Kathryn wants to keep it alive in captivity, while a sleazy film maker named FitzRoyce (Simon MacCorkindale) thinks the shark ought to be killed on camera, or else turned into a tourist attraction. Then the little shark's mother puts in an appearance. The mother is roughly the size and shape of a 35-foot-long battering ram, and she has a much nastier disposition than junior's.\r\n\r\nAside from integrating the mother shark into the wonders of Sea World -as a fin behind a chorus line of water skiers, say - the chief job of the director, Joe Alves, is to find ways to call attention to the process. Mr. Alves has used a lot of undersea footage that is interesting enough to watch, even if it's often more decorative than scary.\r\n\r\nAlthough ''Jaws 3'' introduces some novel inside-the-shark'smouth chewing shots, it's less gory than its predecessors. Without Steven Spielberg's timing or John Williams's music, the shark's periodic visits become feeding scenes rather than ferocious attacks. It's like watching someone make regular raids on a refrigerator in search of midnight snacks.\r\n\r\nThe Jaws cycle has reached its nadir with this surprisingly tepid Jaws 3.\r\n\r\nGone are Roy Scheider, the summer resort of Amity, and even the ocean. They have been replaced by Florida's Sea World, a lagoon and an Undersea Kingdom that entraps a 35-foot Great White, and a group of young people who run the tourist sea park.\r\n\r\nThe picture [from a screen story by Guerdon Trueblood] includes two carry-over characters from the first two Jaws, Scheider's now-grown sons, who are played by nominal star Dennis Quaid as the older brother turned machine engineer and kid brother John Putch.\r\n\r\nFemme cast is headed by Bess Armstrong as an intrepid marine biologist who lives with Quaid.\r\n\r\nDirector Joe Alves, who was instrumental in the design of the first Jaws shark and was the unsung production hero in both the first two pictures, fails to linger long enough on the Great White.",

No amount of cheap 3D fx can save this laughable misfire, that contains the absolutely worst looking shark fx in the entire Jaws canon, ( which includes the abomination, Jaws The Revenge. )   Joe Alves,  Jaws' production designer,  was hired to helm this mess. \r\n\r\n  Plot :   Chief Brody's son now works in a Sea World like amusement park, alongside  perky Bess Armstrong's dolphin trainer.   A worker by the gate to the ocean gets chomped by Baby Great White, who likes the taste of yummy humans so much,  it decides to swim into the park,  and proceeds  to munch on guests and water skiing employees .  Baby Great White is caught and put on display, much to the delight of park owner,  Louis Gosset Jr ( fresh from his Oscar win for An Officer and A Gentleman )\r\n\r\n   Baby Great White dies.  35 foot mommy Great White comes cruising,  looking for her kid.   Mommy gets royally pissed off,  taking out the Undersea kingdom.  Tourists trapped underwater!  They need rescue!  Dennis and Bess look quasi-concerned.   Lea Thomson is shark snack food.    Did I mention this was in 3D ?  The third dimension isn't terror, it's boredom.",

            "content": "My mother won a competition to see this movie, unfortunately for her it was a children's colouring competition which she had entered and won in my name so I had to go along and accept the prize. As a 12 year old back then I made a few observations about the movie which still hold water (pardon the pun) today.   \r\n  First of all, I was amazed that this was a 3D movie which didn't require red and blue/green lenses but used shades like those of a modern 3D movie.  It suprised me that I didn't see any other film utilize this until the recent offerings.\r\n  Secondly, so much time and effort had been given to the 3D aspect that the shark looked quite unrealistic and the effects in general suffered hugely in comparison to its predecessors. Part of the fear factor in the first films was derived from the fact that you couldn't see the shark in its full glory; we were given glimpses, glimpses that looked like a real shark, glimpses that made us believe that this shark was a predatory animal after its prey.  In this movie, so much was shown of the shark that we could plainly see that it was a fake; in one scene we see a diver being attacked by the shark with its mouth open, attempting to 'bite' the diver without moving its jaws.  Near the end we see a model of a shark in a blue screen scene (not a good move); obviously a model shark, obviously not performing the movement it is supposed to be portraying. \r\n\r\nThis movie is bad.  You may gain some pleasure from it but it is drastically inferior to the first and second and is a different kind of movie from the other two in its perspective.\r\n \r\n  Well, that's what I thought when I was twelve.  I did win (or rather my mother did, to her shame) a Long Playing record of the soundtrack which, I have to say, was much better than the movie; You could listen to some of the music and imagine underwater scenes, including a realistic shark.",

            "content": "Didn't think it was possible to take a backwards step in terms of graphics, but if you thought the original Jaws was comical, these effects were embarrassing. Vaguely linked to the previous storylines, a young male meant to be the original Sheriffs son is working in a waterpark, when it inadvertadly houses a 35 foot shark in its confides. How the beast goes unnoticed in such a small remit I don't know, but after devouring several of the staff and public, the owners and remaining workers begin to believe that such a monster is actually living within the resort. Torn between whether to utilise the opportunity to benefit the facilities profits, or whether to just kill the thing, enough time passes for a few more people to die before they eventually arrive at the sensible move. Famed for having several moments of suspense in prior movies, this edition lacks that cutting edge, and instead attempts to throw some gore in to spice matters up. Unfortunately that move degrades it even further, and but for some reasonably credible acting, there's not too much originality or credibility to be extracted from this. This appears to be a much unwanted step back from the classic thrillers we've witnessed before and unlike those, leaves us with no on screen connection to any of the lead characters. Possibly produced on the back of its names credentials and undisputed success, it might be best to now put an end to the series before it gets itself famed for all the wrong reasons.",

Jaws 3-D (how threequels in the 80s used this 3-D title gag?)  is terrible.  It's clear the entire film hinged on the 3-D gags which look worse than your average 3-D gag.  Seeing the film not in 3-D leaves the film looking kinda drab and blurry.  The heart of the original, and to a lesser extent the sequel, is completely forgotten.  The characters are just tools to further the plot, and any moment that could have made you believe in the characters gets lost in bad acting.  Its not even like funny bad acting or overacting...it just seems like Quaid and company are just saying the lines.  No emotion at all is put forth.  Bad flick.",

That's not to say that the film isn't poorly executed. The now-dead 3-D sequences make the film a visual disaster. Its thrills are extremely cheap, and the only thing remotely creepy about the films atmosphere is the musical score. The acting is subpar and the robot shark actually got worse this time around. But for all these things, why is it that I still find this film entertaining? Good question. Even I don't have an answer for it.",
