    "summary": "After getting a green card in exchange for assassinating a Cuban government official, Tony Montana (Al Pacino) stakes a claim on the drug trade in Miami. Viciously murdering anyone who stands in his way, Tony eventually becomes the biggest drug lord in the state, controlling nearly all the cocaine that comes through Miami. But increased pressure from the police, wars with Colombian drug cartels and his own drug-fueled paranoia serve to fuel the flames of his eventual downfall.",

He nailed it and Bauer was a phenomenal compliment. You know one thing that's rarely brought up when discussing the movie is Tony Montana died because he didn't kill a lady and her kids.

In addition; the role played by the actors makes us move to the early 80s, the time in which the film takes place. Through Tony Montana; which is the main character, played by Al Pacino, we see how having great ambition can be the cause of a rapid rise to power and also a tragic descent.\n\nScarface has marked a before and after in the history of cinema, and to this day, we continue to see numerous references to this film in songs or other films.\n\nI consider that it is a great audiovisual work and everyone should see it at least once, since in spite of it lasts almost three hours, with the fights, dialogues and scenes it is impossible to get bored!",

On watching it this time, however, I'm reasonably sure what I thought I'd seen I'd only imbibed through the rest of pop culture. Right or wrong in that regard, I've seen it now. \n\nIt's terrific, of course; and given the writer, the director and the era it's not without parts that haven't aged well - either technically or morally. I'm never quite sure with any of his films how much De Palma is critiquing what he's portraying, and across the three hours of this, that's especially the case here. \n\nBut there's no doubt it's gripping, and Pacino is as magnetic as you expect. The script has weaknesses, and some of the direction just doesn't work to modern eyes - but in the pantheon of organised crime dramas, there are many more behind it than there are ahead of it.",

What justifies the substance is Brian de Palma's skillful direction providing thematic character study whilst playing around with aesthetical merits and staging the action that capably, and definitively, bolster the cult classic status with unique trigger control taken to unseen limits. He benefitted from Al Pacino's independence as he returned to similar crime scenes with a heightening, thematically fulfilling performance, lingering intellectually over pitiful irrationality. This 80s action drama seems to still have what it takes to solidify its recognition through the sporadically praiseworthy merits, only to be shadowed by the films it eventually inspired that were most likely seen first.

Una obra que se mueve entre géneros y logra expresar de manera inmersiva e impactante todo lo que propone, ya sea en momentos en los que se inclina hacia el drama o cuando camina en el campo del cine criminal y de acción. Al Pacino es excelente en el papel del icónico personaje Tony Montana, expresando muy bien toda la personalidad y las diferentes actitudes de Tony, quien está obsesionado con obtener todo el poder posible. Hablando más del personaje, su desarrollo comienza dando \"pistas\" sobre su personalidad, como la frialdad y la ambición, que son elementos claves en el desarrollo, siendo fundamentales para que el personaje alcance su pico y eso es lo que básicamente sucede en la película; un hombre se está sumergiendo en el poder y el dinero proveniente de las oportunidades que surgen debido a las diferentes situaciones en las que esta involucrado. Es de destacar que el ascenso plantea una interrogante sobre el pensamiento de que el poder y el dinero cambian al ser humano, ya que se puede apreciar que sus valores y características se mantienen a medida que ascienden en el mundo criminal, siendo solo potenciados por el creciente uso de drogas. El caso es que Tony Montana no fue forjado por el mundo criminal, fue forjado para el mundo criminal. Finalmente, en contrapunto al ascenso, está la caída, que caracteriza un trágico final a la historia del personaje, quizás el único final posible para un hombre atormentado, que tenía un pozo de ambición y logró extraer todo de él, encontrando solo el vacío y que nada podía consolarlo más que la muerte, más aún así, luchando y desatando todo el tormento construido por los hechos finales de la película. En general la historia es excelente, acompañada por una brillante dirección de Brian De Palma, un soundtrack tremendo y excelentes actuaciones de Al Pacino, Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, entre otros. En conclusión, me parece una tremenda película, contando la trágica historia de Tony Montana, desde sus comienzos, ascenso y descenso. Muy recomendada.",

Al Pacino is excellent in the role, expressing all of Tony's personality and faces very well, especially as he is immersed in a meteoric escalation of power. Talking more about the character, his development begins by giving \"clues\" about his personality, such as coldness and ambition, which are key elements in the development, being fundamental for the character to reach his peak and that's what basically happens in the film , a man is being submerged in power and money coming from opportunities that arise due to his personality. It is noteworthy that the rise raises a question about the thought that power and money change the human being, as it can be seen that their values ​​and characteristics are maintained as they rise in the criminal world, being only enhanced by the increasing use of drugs . The point is that Tony Montana was not forged by the criminal world, he was forged for the criminal world. Finally, in counterpoint to the rise, there is the fall, which characterizes an apotheotic ending to the character's story, perhaps the only possible end for a tormented man, who had a well of ambition and managed to extract everything from him, finding only the empty and that nothing could comfort him but death, even more so the way it was, struggling and unleashing all the torment built by the final events of the film.",

Italian-Americans are pretty synonymous with the gangster film, but here we get the story of something which could have happened when Castro sent his criminals over to America. Never have I seen the extravagance of the money and power that the drug (mostly cocaine) industry shown in such a manner before. De Palma refused to back down to the MPAA as the film, regardless of recuts, kept getting an X rating. The more provocative scenes and R-rated material is needed for the audience to get the best understanding of Tony Montana's life and rise to power - to get to his richness he had to do a lot of violent deeds and gets addicted to his own supply. Luckily, De Palma and Universal famously appealed to the MPAA and it then got an R rating because really it is violent but so are plenty of other R rated films. I really can't comment on the authenticity or offensiveness of the portrayal of Cuban Americans as I'm not knowledgeable on the subject, with that said though, I do believe Pacino's acting that he is this character. He is one of the greatest actors of all time and it shows here. This isn't the operatic feeling Godfather, nor is it the fast paced Goodfellas - it is in it's own world cut off from the likes of Scorsese and Coppola. A true classic that I waited too long to view, but when I finally did I was far from disappointed.",

I would say that Scarface might be one of those movies that's 10 minutes too long- as in it's close to the right runtime, but I still think they could've cut some things out and the characters' motivations would be the same.

While I was thinking about this, it went on the whole new level with the violence for the most part because it's directed by Brian De Palma. I know he's not going to make a movie overly violent to get an NC-17. Al Pacino as Tony Montana is what everyone loves, his character is incredible with his Cuban accent and his dialogue. He has his friend, Manny and a younger sister and later takes over Frank Lopez' place and becomes addicted to cocaine. This is the first time that you'll see Steven Bauer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio in the film. I love the soundtrack in this movie. The soundtrack is awesome and amazing. It actually came before Grand Theft Auto III which is amazing. I love all the songs in this such as \"Rush Rush\", \"Shake It Up\", \"Push It To The Limit\" my personal favourite along with \"She's on Fire\" and \"I'm Hot Tonight\". If you forgot about that Scarface starring Al Pacino is the original version, think again. This is a remake to the B&W film from the 1930's. Scarface is the original film shot in B&W in the 30's and now you're looking at the ultimate gangster and I mean, the ultimate badass! Al Pacino does a great job as Tony Montana. He's unforgettable in this. \"You wanna play rough? Okay. Say hello to my little friend!\" \"You know what I'm talking about, you f**king cockroach.\" And the script is great and it's written by the director Oliver Stone which is a surprising thought. He was Tony Montana. The world will remember him by another name ...Scarface.",

He is a thugged out dude and fears nothing. This brings him to the top.

            "content": "Classic 80s action/crime flick from director Brian De Palma and screenwriter Oliver Stone. This film is hard for me to be objective about because I've seen it so many times and it's an inappropriate childhood favorite. Sure it's overlong. Sure it's gratuitously violent. Sure Al Pacino is over-the-top and constantly at the top of his lungs, but \"Scarface\" is a film that revels in its excesses, much like the 80s, and that is a large part of why the film has endured and what makes it so fun. A critical and commercial bomb upon its initial release (even ardent De Palma defender Paulina Kael gave the film a negative review), the film later gained cult status after its release on VHS. Oliver Stone's screenplay is an update of Howard Hawks' 1932 original film of the same name based on prohibition era gangster Al Capone, but instead of Paul Muni as an Italian gangster working his way up the criminal underworld in Chicago, Al Pacino's Scarface is Tony Montana, a Cuban refuge working his way up the criminal underworld in a neon soaked and coke fueled south Florida. Still in place are storylines about his rise to power, his weird obsession with his younger sister, and the central theme of \"The World is Yours.\" Both films at their heart are a bastardized version of the Horatio Alger story and the \"American Dream.\" Interestingly, Hawks' film was condemned for its excessive violence upon its release, as was the 80s version, and that excessive blood and violence is significant in what makes the film so memorable. The excesses of \"Scarface,\" from garnish cars, fashion, and music (composed by the great Giorgio Moroder), to characters living wildly lavish and extravagant lifestyles, to most notably the film's graphic violence, are incredibly fun to watch for fans of this sort of thing. Audiences will be simultaneously attracted to and repulsed by the world of \"Scarface,\" at once waningt to live in this lavish and impossible lifestyle, but at the same time find it debauched and repugnant. The cast of \"Scarface\" is another major element of the film's appeal and longevity, led by Pacino in one of his most memorable roles, along with the underrated Steven Bauer (the only actual Cuban in the principal cast) as Montana's loyal best friend, Robert Loggia as Montana's boss, a wonderfully trashy Michelle Pfeiffer before she was famous playing the boss' girlfriend and the target of Montana's awkward affections (\"Grease 2\" was her only lead role prior to this film),  F. Murray Abraham as the boss' main henchmen, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's sister. There's also loads of familiar faces like De Palma regular Gregg Henry, Harris Yulin as a dirty cop, Richard Belzer, and many other faces you'll recognize (one of which is a young Brett Ratner as a boy lying on a raft in pool). But director Brian De Palma is who really makes \"Scarface\" a classic. Pacino chews the scenery as Tony, but it's De Palma's action, suspense, and atmosphere that make it so memorable. De Palma brings his usual cinematic panache for suspense set pieces, the most memorable of which of which is a drug deal gone wrong that comes early on in the film. That scene is vintage De Palma in building of suspense as Tony and his friend are ambushed and then tied up in a bathroom, tortured with a chainsaw over where they've hidden their buy-money. The slow pans back and forth from a South Beach hotel room to Steven Bauer sitting outside in a car on the street flirting with a blond instead of being on lookout are wonderuflly suspenseful. De Palma's use of sound is masterful and frightening when he cuts back from Bauer on the street to the roar of a chainsaw in a hotel bathroom as Pacino is about to have his face ripped off. It's a crazy scene and it's too bad it comes so early in the film because it doesn't get topped later, but there are several other standout sequences including a nightclub shootout, an excellent suspense buildup scene involving a remote car bomb, and the film's memorable finale (\"Okay. You wanna play rough? Okay. Say hello to my little friend!\") is very nearly as memorable as the earlier drug deal scene.  Also in the film's credits is Ferdinando Scarfiotti as the visual consultant, which I'm not quite sure what he did on the film, but Scarfiotti worked primarily as a production designer on a number of visually memorable films including \"The Last Emperor,\" \"Daisy Miller,\" \"Cat People,\" and \"Toys\". I'm not sure what he did on this film, but the look of \"Scarface\" is unique and pretty amazing. But if I do have a complaint about the film, it's that once Tony reaches the top of the crime ladder, the film's pacing takes a major nosedive and is not nearly as engaging as the early or later parts of the film. Still, outside of that, the film is utterly brilliant. Overall, \"Scarface\" is in essence the 80s personified, for better or for worse, and is memorable for it all the same.",

            "content": "A raucous blaze of glory.\n\nScarface (1983) is Brian De Palma taking everything about the 1980's and turning it up to 11. The girls, cocaine, guns, dealing, and debauchery is unlike any other gangster movie. This is De Palma moving the camera across atrocity. He points out the flaws in these criminals that you love to watch, but you cannot take your eyes away from the violence. It is intense, funny, and poignant. Witness corruption, bribery, and gunfire with a reckless abandon.\n\nAl Pacino is the real star of Scarface. You laugh at his jokes and listen in to his Cuban accent, but you are stunned by his brashness and cunning. Pacino's plays Tony Montana with a vicious flair that you cannot help but love. It's an eccentric performance for an eccentric time. Scarface is as intense as Pacino ever gets.\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer is gorgeous and sultry as Elvira Hancock. You'll never forget Pfeiffer after seeing her in Scarface. But she is not just a pretty face. Pfeiffer takes on the greed and boredom of the mob's hedonism and addiction with a sincere passion. I love her role in Scarface. She shines a mirror on how depraved and unsustainable their lifestyle really ends up.\n\nSimilarly, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is excellent as Gina Montana. She portrays a good woman trying to live her life, only to have it upended by Tony Montana's ambitions and selfish desires. She has several memorable scenes to her credit.\n\nNext, I would like to give a shoutout to the supporting actors Steven Bauer and F. Murray Abraham for their respective parts. I like how they play the henchmen characters quite a bit.\n\nNotably, Scarface is first major credit for Oliver Stone. Stone wrote Scarface. No easy feat, but an admirable one as his memorable one liners and complex crime plot are excellently written. Stone had greatness all lined up for him clearly with how deep his characterization of Tony Montana dives and how he sets up the fall of Scarface. It is a testament to great screen writing that Stone wrote Scarface with such iconic characters and quotable lines.\n\nLastly, Giorgio Moroder scored Scarface. His haunting synths and escalating sounds underline the tumultuous nature of Scarface and all its violence. Moroder is just a phenomenal composer. His numerous musical accomplishments speak for themselves, Scarface being another brilliant piece of art.\n\nOverall, Brian De Palma directed another gangster epic with Scarface. Like his movie The  Untouchables, this is as classic and influential as they come. Enjoy the greed of it all.",

There's no doubt that Oliver Stone is a great screenwriter, but with Brian De Palma behind the camera Oliver Stone's screenplay became very very entertaining, not just smart. I felt I was watching a movie its script is written by Aaron Sorkin, and is directed by Martin Scorsese! \n\nAl Pacino delivered a powerhouse performance as Tony Montana which, in my opinion, is the second best performance in his long career, just right behind his exceptional performance as Michael Corleone in The Godfather II. I don't want to say that Al Pacino's performance elevated the movie, because the movie is already great, but as a matter of fact, Scarface couldn't have become a classic without his iconic performance.\n\nSpeaking of the Godfather, Scarface also is a movie that takes a bad guy and allow him to be a human. The result is a nasty, and vicious protagonist that you couldn't help but root for. But it doesn't stop here, In this movie I didn't only sympathized with Tony Montana, but I also sympathized with the people Tony Montana care about the most. I cared about his relatives that I was about to shed some tears, in a gangster flick!!!!\n\nThe pacing is fast, and that was very acceptable. But at the last hour the movie dragged a little bit, but it picked up very quickly, and I found myself very engaged again.\n\nAlso, I have to mention the De Palma's spectacular representation of the Magic City, Miami. And the movie's electrifying soundtrack. \n\nScarface is one of the best gangster films of all-time that doesn't only entertain, but it also a great character study, and has an underlying moral philosophy. And above all things, it's the most Scorsese-esque films not directed by Martin Scorsese.\n\n(9/10)",

            "content": "The first time I ever learned about the movie Scarface was when I bought a T-shirt from the Supreme online store. I wanna know the roots of this picture, so I did some research online and found out it's a gangster movie. I'm interested in this type of movies, because the mafia stuffs are really cool. The real things happened in our lives. Also I could learn some history about America, it's very helpful me. I like the culture of freedom, that's why I came to United States for college. \n\tScarface is a 1983 American crime film directed by Brian De Palma  and written by Oliver Stone. \"Tony, a man for whom \"ambitious\" is too weak a word, quickly rises up the ranks of the Cuban underworld. Relentless, shrewd, and heeding no boundaries save those of loyalty and personal honor in his ravenous acquisition of power and status. Unfortunately, in the eighties the means to this end for a significant number of people was the nefarious illegal drug trade. Little white powders that could be easily transported and sold for an incredible profit permitted the less moral young entrepreneurs to do everything and anything necessary to grab the riches they coveted\". This is the basis of the tale of the Cuban immigrant Tony Montana as told in Scarface. As the story begins Tony and his friend Manny are literally just off the boat from Cuba. Tony and Manny are dedicated to obtaining their Green Cards and becoming rich. The more legitimate ways to obtain these goals never seem to cross their minds. \n\tIt has many different elements to this movie Scarface  and I'm going to talk about the first scene from the movie. They begin with blank black screen and white text. The text is small and just at the bottom of the screen like subtitles.This shows up that it is background informations to help us understand the movie we are gonna watch. The next one is the form of the opening scene is an interrogation.We didn't see  the faces of the immigrations officers in the scene, the camera focus on a guy who has scar on his face. So that all we know this guy is main character in the film. We might be know he is a tough man and it shows up he's not afraid to get in flights. Tony is an anti-hero, he is not one of the good guys but we instantly like him. Tony was wearing a Hawaiian shirt, it means he came to Miami just relaxed and enjoy the holiday. We might be know he's not United citizens. And the immigrations officers wearing the uniforms it means authority. I think the target audiences is for the teanngers, espicailly for the man what the age range of 18-35. There has some adult subjects in the movie, such as sex,murder and drugs.\n In the years that followed, this movie has received reappraisal from critics. A bunch of people said \"Scarface\" is one of the best crime movies ever made,especially in the gangster genre.Which has been referenced extensively in pop culture, especially in rap, hip hop music, comic books and video games. A lot of American rappers released the songs about Tony or the film. For example,Nas - \"The World Is Yours\" and  Jay-Z - \"Moment of Clarity\". As a result, the castle-like mansion has high fences, bodyguards, and advanced surveillance systems.In addition, he also learned Cuban English accent - his fuzzy accent makes Tony's character appear fresh and iconic.I think Tony has courage.Tony said Frank was a coward, and Tony was bold, so he seized a lot of opportunities, got the chance of a green card, the opportunity to be the first pot of life, cross the middleman, become a partner, and evan get rid of him. In the eyes of the unsuspecting former boss, he finally expanded his territory of drug trafficking to a much greater extent than before. At first, Tony was so bold that he dared to do everything he wanted and he was talented in the negotiations. The money can not give him happiness, the continuous increase in drug intake also brought him no happiness. In the end, he shot and killed his partner and his brother-in-law. He was completely enslaved by impulsiveness. He loves his younger sister, but he does not know what to do with her. Tony Montana believed something simpler and more directly. This world belongs to me. In this world that belongs to me, the only person I can trust is myself. Tony's life is like a gambler in a casino, always using all the money to pay the highest odds. He won all the games but lost the last one. He won all the people and lost to himself. Tony is a paranoid and everything he creates ends up crashing under the sign of \"the world is yours\".\nThe movie argues that sometimes the  American dream can go wrong.  It makes this argument by making Tony a sympathetic character in this movie. I think this movie depicts an extreme case of how living the American Dream can go wrong. Living the \"American Dream\" is great as long as it done by your working on it. Lies and scams happen everyday, because those people trying to advance themselves to get more power and money.  Once they got it, their morals become clouded with greed and lust for power.America is a land of opportunities and it is unnecessary to resort to crime and violence to achieve success.Contemporary perceptions of the American Dream define it as  monetary gains and power in society, and I think that most people would agree that least one aspect of the American Dream is the acquisition of money and power, At this point in the movie Tony saw a blimp flying through the sky that reads, \"The world is yours.\" This fuels his ambition and becomes the motto that he lives by. He makes it his goal to rise to the top, and will do anything to get there. Although he has money and power he is never happy with it.",

            "content": "Scarface can be added to the long line of gangster movies that do nothing for me. This one was one of the roughest because I could not find one shred of likability in the character of Tony Montana, and yet the movie forces us to follow him around as if he’s a hero protagonist for three hours of vile deeds. The infamous ending of the film is played like a tragic opera unfolding as he finally meets his demise. For me it was a celebratory moment because, not only did that mean the film was going to end soon, but he was getting what he deserved at last. It was a brilliant choice to cast Al Pacino in the lead role, because he can hold down that thick Cuban accent well, and he has lashes out in rage as good as anyone. Michelle Pfeiffer was terribly underused, which bugged me a lot. Instead we got way too much of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, who I like as an actress, but I don’t know what fool thought she would be convincing as a Cuban. Her accent is laughable in the rare moments when she tries to use it. I’ve seen the end of Scarface before, in fact I think everyone is aware of it on some level, which you would think would lessen some of the drama. However, in this movie his demise seems like a foregone conclusion. I cannot believe how reckless his actions are throughout the film. At first I was surprised how aggressive he acted, but then he never saw any negative consequences for his actions, so it lessened the severity for me as a viewer. The stakes didn’t seem to be there until the end, and that would have been frustrating if I cared more about the story. The point is, I’m not wired right to enjoy most movies about gangsters, so my opinion is probably useless to most of you. If you don’t have the same hang-ups as me, and you can enjoy these tales of evil people slowly spiraling down to their own demise, then Scarface could be a favorite for you. If you’re anything like me, though, don’t bother with Scarface because there’s nothing to set this film apart from the familiar tropes of its genre. ",

I've never seen this movie before in my life, despite the fact that I got a 3D poster of Scarface in my room, and I had it in my DirecTV list for a few years. So when I wanted to delete something, I figure I'll just go at the bottom at the list, and watch this, which turns out to be an insane film. Al Pacino gives a maniacal performance that you can't help but love that kind of acting, especially when it's from Pacino himself. I thought that at first, Scarface was going to be like The Godfather since it's a crime film, and of course it has Al Pacino in it, but it actually didn't felt like it at all as the characters are more insane in this than The Godfather, and the plot gives in more towards the extremes of it while the other is more of a calming and professional way. The direction by Brian De Palma is very kinetic that keeps it on feet, and the writing by Oliver Stone is very well-written that I'm surprised that this is from the same guy who did Platoon, JFK, and Wall Street. The characters are very memorable, especially from Tony Montana who you just love to hate, and when it gets to the end, I just ended up feeling sorry for him for being so pathetic in this. Despite the fact that it's 170 minutes long, it manages to be very interesting, although there were some slow patches on the way there. It's interesting to see Michelle Pfeiffer in one of her first roles, and even back then she was really good in it and make more than that type of character that she plays it to be. Scarface is a really great that I can see why it's considered to be one of the best crimes ever made.",

Should we not strive to be the best no matter what situation? Frank says that those who lay low and are content with what they have live through this business.

De Palma's direction choices didn't always agree with me, specifically some shot choices where the camera veers off of what you want to be looking at in a jarring way, almost ripping you away from the focus of some scenes. Additionally, some of the time jumps in the film felt rushed, and I wished we spent more time in some of those periods or at least explored some other avenues within those time frames. The colour palette for this film is gorgeous, using island/beach/neon colours to evoke the glamour and liveliness of Montana's lifestyle. Overall, Pacino is easily the best part of Scarface and is ultimately why the film works as well as it does.",

            "content": "\"Scarface\" remains to be a singular mob film some thirty-plus years after its release.  Ignoring the subtleties and suave attitudes of many of its peers (\"The Godfather\" series, \"The Departed\") and going for the guise of a Grand Guignol soap opera, it's fiercely over-the-top, artistically maximalist, emotionally cartoonish, and sadomasochistically violent.  Nothing about it is remotely embedded in reality, but maybe that's what makes it such a bewildering experience; it is so pumped up with lethal confidence and mountainous opulence that its carnage is only a part of its aesthetic, to be lapped up with delirium amongst the various thugs and glamorous women.\n\tTaken from an incandescent screenplay by Oliver Stone, \"Scarface\" is directed by none other than Brian De Palma, whose eminence arrived in the 1970s through several sexy, stylish B-pictures, his reputation solidified by 1976's \"Carrie,\" and later works such as 1980's \"Dressed to Kill\" and 1981's \"Blow Out.\" The film, though, was his very first big hustle, a piece lacking his previous Hitchcockian instincts and instead heading for the breadth of a magnum opus, epic in length and epic in aspiration.  With \"Scarface,\" we play audience to a director being challenged by material that does the talking all on its own, his quirks and nuances hushed down for Stone's subversions but still supplementary in regards to the loud colors of the movie itself.   \n\tAnd so the illustrious exaggerations from Stone and De Palma are perhaps amplified by the film's star, Al Pacino, who is an American actor playing Cuban with all the caginess of Ron Jeremy doing a belly flop into a kiddie pool.  Elsewhere, Pacino's theatrical method acting might be observed as overacting.  But because he possesses unbreakable certitude and an unsettling of way of becoming rather than portraying, Pacino is \"Scarface's\" most valuable asset.  Without him, the excesses Stone and De Palma so shamelessly promote would seem artificially extravagant; Pacino embodies the terrifyingly believable extremism needed to match the exorbitant textures of the film.  \n\tHis Tony Montana, as iconic a mobster as Brando's Vito Corleone, is a character that almost immediately announces himself to be one for the ages, our introduction to him as instantaneously unforgettable as Dustin Hoffman's asking of Mrs. Robinson if she's trying to seduce him, as cerebrally permanent as Rita Hayworth's rendition of \"Put the Blame on Mame\" in 1946's \"Gilda.\" We first meet Montana in 1980, when he's a penniless refugee trying to make it in America.  A criminal before his arrival in Florida, only a brief period of what we'd like to call humble beginnings passes before he's back to his old ways.  After a series of cutthroat criminal detours, he is hired by Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia), a Miami drug kingpin who sees potential in his unshakable brutishness.\n\tYears pass, and Tony metamorphoses into something more than your average drug dealer.  He, after much backstabbing and much petty clawing, rises to the top of his crime keychain, becoming a narcotics lord in a relatively short time.  We endure his marriage to Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer), a cutting, slinky blonde, his questionable relationship with his sister (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), to whom he is incestuously attracted, his backward friendship with his wingman, Manny (Steven Bauer), and, eventually, his downfall, which is a direct result of getting addicted to his own supply and being too ruthless to remain protected by reputation alone.\n\tFor being an opportunistic crime saga, though, \"Scarface\" is portentously watchable, moving with snappy pace for nearly three hours and never allowing for us to lose our focus.  And it's not necessarily in response to a compelling storyline, either; it's more because of its sensational ensemble and its ostentatious style, and how they work together to ensure intensity that we fall helpless in response to.  Pacino gives a tour-de-force of a portrayal, and Bauer is handsomely slithery as his devoted right-hand man; but I especially like Pfeiffer as Pacino's snippy, desirable wife, a platinum-haired minx whose own cocaine habit destroys her, and Mastrantonio as the kid sister who vaguely understands the weight of her brother's evils until it's much too late to turn back.  And look at the set design that outlines the antics between these actors; are they not underrated support for such overstated drama? Similarly scrumptious is Giorgio Moroder's score, which is synthetic, sparkling, and dated, and yet captures the shabby lusciousness of the movie's parts.  ?\t\"Scarface\" falls short of greatness only because it never rings as much more than beautifully executed pulp - with an anti-hero more godly than human at its front, it's all sinful fantasy dipped in temptation and power, emotionally unreachable because it's more cinematic than it is ingenuous.  But what a deciduous complaint for a film of such adamantine, zealous splendor.  There isn't anything like it, and it's better that things are kept that way.",

All are about someone who eventually makes it big through sheer perseverance and are written by people who know nothing about the industries they chose to depict and how to gain power in them and the writers themselves never achieved any kind of remarkable success. The Hollywood producers of Scarface are big shots like Scarface himself, so  I can only suppose, but my guess is they thought: \"Good, this script tells no one anything about how under any circumstances to beven slightly successful at anything.\" Just a wild guess. The big difference between all three works of fiction is that Scarface starts as a boat person and winds up as billionaire - my estimate, since he uses many money counter machines to count his Ben Franklins - drug dealer. The story is so implausible that if outer space aliens arrived during the movie I wouldn't be surprised. That makes sense too:  aliens? He's an illegal alien? Only in Hollywood. \nScarface serves the same function that Horatio Alger used to serve; it will give your wanna be thug friend - everyone has one - hope that one day she/he can fullfill their dreams.",

            "content": "Dripping in charisma, flooded with violence and profanity, filled with riotous drug use and centred around one of the most energy infused performances seen in cinematic history, Brian De Palma's Miami set 1983 gangster classic Scarface is a movie that sits on its black leathered throne high above all others before and all others since. Scarface is a movie that put its Oliver Stone penned middle finger up to those that shunned excess and made it it's cornerstone that has now seen it become not only a movie marvel but a member of pop culture that many movies only dream to be a part of.\n\nA remake of the 1932 Howard Hawkes directed film of the same name, De Palma's updated tale was upon release misunderstood by both audiences and critics alike. People knew not how to take a film that revelled in 3 hours of epic debauchery, murder, vanity and drugs and a main character that only \"trusts himself\" and only has his \"balls and his words, and he doesn't break either of them\". It's not hard to see why so many were put off by Al Pacino's frank and stunning turn as an immigrant who can think of nothing more than taking the world any way he can and taking no prisoners in doing so. It's interesting watching such a character at work in today's movie age in which all hero's and antiheroes must have a backbone as to why they do as they do, whereas Tony Montana just wants, he doesn't need a reason to own a tiger or rake in millions he just does it and enjoys doing so. It's a real testament to both the performance of Al Pacino and the script by Stone that this journey and man work the way they do as it would have been an easy feat for the movie to go off the rails without them at full strength which is the same as renowned director Brian De Palma.\n\nInstilling the Miami set film with a sense of life rarely seen on cinema screens, De Palma's Scarface is a film not only made by its subject and actors but a film that is transcended by its locale becoming a key component of the story it harbors. Miami lives and breathes under De Palma's steady hand (despite it being filmed elsewhere in the majority) and the sense of opportunity it presents to its migrated Cubans can be not only sensed by the audience but felt also. De Palma is a director well known for his erratic efforts behind the camera for every Untouchables there's a Femme Fatale and for every Blow Out there's a Raising Cain, but here the director is in charge at every angle, every performance feels right, every brutal act of gang violence strikes a blow and every synthesised beat of Giorgio Moroder's now classic score resonates. It's a film that works on all levels and De Palma is the king of its unique domain.\n\nScarface is a movie that speaks for itself, it is what it is and that's why it has become the masterpiece many now see it as being. De Palma's film is a 3 epic that from the first frame to the last is utterly and undeniable excessive and for all the right reasons. From esteemed professionals through to street gangbangers, Scarface speaks to that wannabe crime lord in all of us and gives to us in the form of Tony Montana a protagonist that unlike most others is unashamed of who and what he is and a protagonist that makes this movie such a blast of fresh air even these 30 plus years on.\n\n5 flying flamingos out of 5\n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check out -\n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

            "content": "Upon the release of Scarface in 1983, it was negatively reviewed for its excessive violence, profanity and graphic drug use. Well, in the 1980â??s this was perhaps too excessive for what was already shown on screen therefore it can be considered as one of the first to graphically represent the gritty features of a mob film.\n \nThe 1980â??s were a period of great social change as youthâ??s began to rebel and try new crazy ideas and thus the only way to view Scarface is as a product of the time in which it was conceived. Nowadays it is judged in a society where these graphic representations are acceptable and commonplace. Scarface is regarded as a classic of the crime-gangster genre with adults, but even more so the majority of those fans are teenagers and young adults. This is mainly down to their adoration of Scarfaceâ??s protagonist Tony Montana, portrayed by Al Pacino, a Cuban immigrant turned gun-toting, cocaine-addict drug lord. He usurps a lifestyle that intrigues young audiences who are also dabbing with drugs and wanting to be larger than life. However, the connection between the audience and product draw a fine line there because the term â??Montanaâ?? means wild business.\n \nScarface tells of one manâ??s desire to be the greatest and reach the higher echelons of society; it is a trait that perhaps everyone today suffers from therefore can be identified with. But the stark difference is that Montana does this through illegal means by arriving in Miami with nothing and rising up to become a powerful drug kingpin. Montanaâ??s downfall is his self-confidence and over-indulgent hedonistic lifestyle; which is fantastic to witness as he causes havoc on screen. The graphic violence, drug use and profanity elevate Scarface into the bracket of gritty realism. This realistic depiction is integral to the popularity and longevity of its star and his actions. This dramatic inside look into the life of a criminal can be too weighty after a while because with almost a 3 hour running time, the story does take its toll on you and when the film ends you leave it with a hint of contentment that you watched Scarface. And most probably, you will not revisit the Scarface experience for a long time until it fades in your memory and you desire a dose of what Tony Montanaâ??s on once again.\n \nFor Al Pacino, he was already in The Godfather Part I and Part II and therefore you would think: why feel the need to reincarnate yourself with a new gangster flick that probably will never reach the heights of The Godfather? There is only one reason I can think of: it is because Pacino is the driving force of this movieâ?¦ not the story, setting, other actors or anything else! He made Scarface what it is, and the way you can deduce this is that whenever someone watches Scarface, the only thing they come away with from the film is the amazing Pacino as Montana. We watch a criminal in the making and end up seeing the downfall of that same criminal. It is an intriguing perspective as he starts out normal but his infinite desires changes him for the worse. You see a ruthless maniac in plain viewing but deep down you admire Montana for the vibrant force that he is. Pacino is Montana, he doesnâ??t act as the character; he simply becomes this vicious power because his portrayal is so natural. People consider Al Pacino as one of the greatest actors alive and the purpose of why people have this view is because characters in films like these live on the memory.\n \nScarfaceâ??s legacy upon the world comes in many shapes and forms. Many of the cultural industries have been inspired such as television, films, video games and comic books. It has also influenced the audience greatly through its protagonist and subject matter. Peopleâ??s perceptions of places like Cuba and Miami have been changed because of this film and its famous quotes including â??Say hello to my little friend!â?? have been etched in the memory of every generation at a very young age. It is weird that considering Scarface was criticised heavily for its tough viewing in 1983, it now is watched by every generation at such a young age and isnâ??t frowned upon.\n \nScarface was in the hands of two of the most dependable directors who back then were not as highly revered as they are now. The Director Brian De Palma, of Carrie and The Untouchables, brought to the film a steady mind that could navigate their way through such a tough story and deliver a remarkable outcome. Oliver Stone was relatively new in Hollywood back then, but now the Vietnam veteran, director of Platoon and Wall Street, has become an Oscar winning director and screenwriter for a few films. Scarface had a direction, which was to represent realistically the toils of criminal life by in the meantime creating a cinematic legend in the making. It simply is just pure genius! However, despite it being remarkable, it may stand in the gangster genre next to The Godfather and Goodfellas, but in all truth, it is a tad bit below its fellow gangster colleagues.\n \nThe reason for Scarfaceâ??s international recognition as one of the best mob films ever to be made is, in truth, wholly down to its star Al Pacino whose performance as Tony Montana catalysed its enduring legacy.\n \nâ??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??        9/10",

I don't know, I just don't know why, but for the life of me I cannot get into Brian DePalma's huge cult movie \"Scarface.\" I've tried, I've really tried. I love \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\" I love \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.\" I even thought \"Blow\" was a very good movie, but for some reason and I am prepared to debate this on a great level, but I truly believe for me at least, that \"Scarface\" is completely and hugely overrated. I don't get it, maybe because Al Pacino plays the biggest piece of shit ever portrayed on screen that I just cannot get into it and sympathies with Tony Montana. In his own words he is a \"cock a roach!\" Complete scum in my eyes. And I know, that's who these guys really are and that is what Pacino and director Brian DePalma were going for in this very dark, and cruel underworld of the Cuban mafia underworld in Miami, Florida during the 1980's. I love Brian DePalma too. \"The Untouchables\" is one of the greatest gangster flicks ever made. I even think \"Carlito's Way,\" which reunites Pacino and DePalma, was a much better movie than this. Mostly too because I thought Sean Penn was so good as Pacino's coked out Jewish lawyer that I thought his performance to the movie really added hugely to the movies effect. \"Carrie\" also is one of the best horror movies ever made, another DePalma masterpiece, but I'm sorry \"Scarface\" just doesn't do it for me. I can see the attraction and everything for most people, but I don't know, I'm more of a Scorsese guy. \"Goodfellas,\" \"Casino,\" \"Raging Bull,\" \"The Departed,\" and \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" which I think is Scorsese's greatest masterpiece by far. But \"Scarface\" I'm sorry, is going on my list as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm sorry, I truly am, but I cannot deny the fact any longer that I cannot get into this movie no matter how many times I watch it. Again, I'm sorry.",

He is an exiled Cuban criminal, who is always one step ahead from everybody to becoming one of the most dangerous drug load in Miami, Florida. Once he is at the top, he becomes truly obsessed and panaroid. Not to mention, sniffing cocaine on his supply and destroying things that once matters to him.

De Palma has some brilliant set pièces here, not to mention the late John A. Alonzo's (Star Trek:Generations, Chinatown, Harold & Maude) stylish Widescreen cinematography. Giorgio Moroder's (Cat People \"1982\", Flash Dance, Midnight Express) music score is also quite good. The supporting cast are terrific, how matter how big or small, their roles are...they do have memorable presence in it as well. De Palma's film is often very pace, while \"Scarface\" wallows in unpleasentness for nearly three hours but somehow De Palma's direction, Pacino's dynamic presence and Stone's script that also has an satirical edge on the American Dream and more. Which De Palma, Pacino and Stone touches on the picture, it is them that makes \"Scarface\", an excellent film.

It is also difficult for me to put aside many of the elements about it that were fresh upon release but are cliche now. It's also hard to not compare it to other gangster movies, and I just don't think it's better than Godfather or Goodfellas. I do think it's very good though. Very good! I think I prefer the first half. The second half is a bit less fun for me because I don't really like to watch the plane going down in flames. I love how Tony is introduced. He's scary but he's got charisma. I LOVE the hotel scene with the chainsaw. I love how it takes you out and then back in again and ramps up the tension. I love the scene in the hot tub \"Fly, pelican, fly!\" and how the camera slowly pulls back and into the ceiling after he treats his wife and best friend/partner like crap, showing how alone he is and how small he really is despite how he talks about himself. It really frustrates me that the popularity of Scarface comes from people who misinterpret it. Tony is a monster. Yes, he has lines he won't cross but he still kills his best friend and alienates everyone he comes in contact with. And people idolized him and want to be like him. Do you really? did you not see the end? Tony is willing to use and hurt and kill anyone he can to satisfy his greed. He's a fascinating character and I get the fantasy of wanting to be like a cool character. But the reality Tony is alone and everyone he knows either is dead because of him or hates him. And then he brings about his own death. The movie is a cautionary tale and shows the extremes of the American dream. \nBut what REALLY frustrates me is how the people who don't like this movie, chiefly complain about its score. UG! The music is PERFECT! This movie's style and even it's whole point is to show a specific time and specific place and a specific state of mind. Having period appropriate score is exactly the right kind to have. It goes hand in hand with the style of the clothes, the cars, the decor, the excess. It's all so 80's. That's the point! \nSo, I think this movie is great but find its misinterpretation annoying. Fight Club has the same problem.",

It's written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma. They understood and foresaw at the time that the movie was a terrible risk and that it would be known to be detested. The casting of Al Pacino as the lead part Tony Montana, satisfied De Palma and Stone with their risks and challenges. Pacino says so many back-stabbing lines in this movie filled with constant swearing and abuse that's totally beyond belief. Steve Bauer is his sidekick and partner in crime, Manny. Manny is more or less the guy who accompanies Tony as a friend and assists him with his drug-dealings in America. He's a part portrayed by Bauer with a lot of innocence and calmness, unlike the crazy and drug-snorting Tony Montana, who's living life like the world is his own big empire. It's got a lot of downsides both on Oliver Stone's side to writing and Brian De Palma's side to the directing. And Pacino plays Tony Montana with an effortless performance - a performance that needs to be toned down a little. Scarface is also horrifically violent and absurd for a lot of good reasons, but it does present thrilling moments and fine puns.",

Francis Ford Coppola is too boring and after watching his gangster films, I felt not even the slight interest in watching the other renowned gangster films of that time. Even at 2 hrs and 44 minutes, Scarface proves to be more interesting and fast paced than the Godfather series that you can almost forgive it's long long running time. Like in all his films, Pacino gives a good performance and I feel bored to say this because it's understood and on all occasions, Pacino's work stays above the entire movie as such. Like in all the gangster movies of the vintage time, here also the protagonist would be a character more selfish than anyone around him and he would not even care for anyone around him, the same is with Tony Montana, but with an addiction for cocaine. This really irritates me because the character does not seem admirable, except for once and moreover, showing all characters snorting the brown sugar for the better part of the movie. My favourite gangster film is The Departed(2006) which I believe is above all these films. Scarface's ending could have been a bit more grant and stretched out, but it's way too good than any Godfather film could have brought up. The leading ladies are nothing bout gorgeous.",

            "content": "With some great movies already in his resume (Blow Out and Carrie for example) Brian De Palma gave us Scarface, back in 1983; a film that is now consider a classic. \nThe film follows the rise and fall of cuban refugee Tony Montana, set up in 1980, Tony arrives to Miami with the desire of power and money. Soon, a very important drug dealer named Frank Lopez gives him a chance to be someone in the drug business.\nFirst of all, I want to applaud De Palma's direction, the movement of the camera, the cinematography and the edition, which is very important in a movie that is almost 3 hours long. The acting is very good, of course the best is Al Pacino's Tony Montana, which is a very complicated character and I cant think of another actor that could play Montana as well as Pacino. Another important thing for me that this film does incredibly well is telling this story with perfect timing, the story presented here is one of Oliver Stone's greatest screenplays, sure he already had the story from the 1930´s version but the changes he made were perfect to make the story more satisfying and more developed. The biggest problem that I have is that some characters are left in the background when they have potencial of doing more in the story.\nOne of the best remakes ever made, arguably better than the original. I consider this De Palma's greatest film and it deserves all the praise it receives. If you enjoy crime/mafia films, this is a must see. One of the best films of the genre!",

            "content": "Grade:Low 8/10\n\nScarface is a dark gangster film that has a great mix of dark and\nviolent scenes mixed with near humorous parts which lighten the film up\nat certain times. With a lead role that makes this film better than\njust good, it also brings us good acting and some quotes that still are\nused in film folklore, worth a watch just to hear the memorable lines.\nI felt this film was just about very good, and here below is why so.\n\nThe story as said is dark, it revolves around drug trading in 1980's\nMiami and a man bent on power to succeed. It is thrilling even at some\ntimes because it really makes you want to see what happens next and at\ntimes leaves you excited as to how Tony Montana will act upon a threat\netc. The film has it's slow parts and can at times be a slight bit\nboring, but nevertheless the ending makes up for some of that with a\nbig ending to a big story, a long story to wade through indeed.\n\nAl Pacino masterfully creates Tony Montana and brings him to be one the\nmost famous gangsters in cinema, with his iconic voice and ever so\ncrazy outbursts, you can't help but kind of like him(and his insanity).\nMichelle Pfeiffer does little to impress here I think and it is\npossible De Palma and Pacino were right when they said they didn't want\nher for the role. Steven Bauer as Manny is maybe the most well acted\nrole ever but still manages to lighten the movie somehow and chips in\nwell.\n\nI think the true man behind the camera here is Oliver Stone, he writes\nthis so well and of course dealing with this own drug problems at the\ntime, he probably felt he knew just what to do with the script. Stone\nwrites well but Brian De Palma doesn't direct up to standards that the\nacting and writing are on, not a bad job at all but he never really\nbrings the best out of every scene and can leave bits becoming stale\nand boring.\n\nThere isn't really so much wrong with this, you could say there is too\nmuch violence and an overuse of it but I think at times it benefits\nfrom it and makes you more thrilled. I said about the directing, that\ncould be classed as criticism and I also felt the camera work or maybe\neven the editing isn't done so well as some rather silly shots and the\nscore quite often gets annoying here, the technical side has bits wrong\nwith it in general.\n\nGangster films fans should enjoy this as it mixes all you could want in\ngangster films together well and creates an even darker drug gang film.\nDon't watch if you dislike dark violence and things along that line as\nyou will not enjoy, I will say it is also a powerful drama led in the\nrole greatly by Pacino, but the violence contained in this might just\nthrow you off it.\n\nOverall I give this a low 8/10 meaning it is Just About Very Good, I think in\nthe end that possibly Pacino just edges this over the line of just\nbeing good into very good with his brilliant portrayal. It is a long\nfilm nearly getting to 3 hours long but worth the watch for so many\npeople who Ii know will just love not only the action scenes and the\nsmartly written plot, but also the crazy tones of Tony Montana who just\nruns everything in this movie.",

As Tony gets richer, he soon learns the hardships of this business.

This is what happens with \"Scarface\" (1983 ): hugely entertaining and enjoyable, but nor think is the masterpiece which all shout. In its premiere, received enormous negative reviews, but as often happens with many works, and as Tommy Duncan said, \"Time changes everything\". That axiom enthusiastically applied in the film, growing over the years to become a cult. The famous double DVD edition marked the success that it was not his first release. Everyone love the movie; Why not ? people crying: Tony Montana; mountains of drugs is what people crave to see, that fantasy and metaphor of the American Dream is what everyone wants to look\n\nBut if you momentarily abstracts that universe, \"Scarface\" has a facile and affected loading. It's \"Alice in the Wonderland\", but Heroin and money version. Part of facility moves to aesthetics, a catalog of eccentricities invading. A soundtrack hyper-saturated of sensationalism stylization (the songs \"Vamos a Bailar\"; \"She's On Fire\"; \"Push It On The Limit\"), exotic and flashy suits, Cadillacs, mountains of cocaine, the \"king\" chair of Montana, etc. Blood, black and the white of the drugs are the three primary colors of the film, like a mafia cartoon at its best. Maybe the real problem is the movie length: if the movie was shorter, would win more precision, but nearly three hours where there are many good scenes but easily editable, so there are too much excess\n\nOliver Stone's script for Al Pacino's version takes some elements of the 1932 version eg the obsession with sister, the murder of the husband of this sister, the phrase \"The World Is Yours\", the betrayal of Tony's boss, etc. Oliver Stone's problem is: transfers certain customs and details in a movie that strongly develops interpersonal relationships: in \"Scarface\" (1983) his sister's husband is a close friend of Montana, so the murder was nonsense. In the 1932 version, the husband was more a bully in the service of Tony. In addition, this 1932 film, obsession to his sister could be understood as the custom of those times where the role of women was too restricted, while in the 1983 production is a bit contradictory: as liberal and anti-communist as Tony Montana is so strict with Gina\n\nTony Montana is arrogant, says phrases for a poster, he does not care about human life and makes apologist of guns. The problem is not that (ultimately all heroes like Terminator or McClaine do), but \"Scarface\" has two serious problems: one is Brian De Palma , who is unable to moderate the behavior of Al Pacino. Pacino is a great actor, but when he overreacts becomes a parody, and that excess is what happens with \"Scarface\" (1983). But actually the problem of Pacino would not be so terrible if the script did not makes a second fatal mistake. The real problem lethal in \"Scarface\" 1983 is: Stone tries to inject a tragedy where there is none. When an overwhelming person like Montana appears, is necessary to write a good core to his character, and so prepare him for the tragedy. The story of Tony Montana should be similar to that of a monster and a sinister sociopath, but the final quality offered by Al Pacino, De Palma and Oliver Stone is a \"bad guy\" who takes drugs to exhaustion (Al Pacino's nose is tainted with cocaine) and is thought \"cool\" in top of the world. Since there is no real tragedy (even the end of the film is very \"cool\" instead tragic, with the bullets that pass through it but he feels nothing because the drugs effects, and the final shotgun. The law does not appears here) Tony Montana is a caricature of a gangster, an entertaining cartoon but filled with psychology of poor quality (melodramatic quality; eg the rule \"not killing children\", excerpted from \"The Godfather\" but here reduced to an element that will mark the end of the protagonist). Montana is a character too much theatrical and noisy, he lacks the modesty of the original version\n\nThis review continues on my personal Tumblr, which has no commercial purpose now\n\nhttp://reviewsandthecity.tumblr.com/post/70214211987/scarface-1983-film-review",

Scarface had all of those qualities, but he lacked anything you could really root for or cheer. He started the movie a poor sociopath and ended alone and a sociopath. He didn't really seem to struggle with any moral questions either. It was very flat.\n\nThat said, the action was fun, and I bet in 1983 it was stunningly violent. Glad I saw it, but meh.",

He comes to America to be something more, and does so with a stubborn but great attitude.  It's a simple film, with amazing acting and characters as well as one of my favorite all time sqripts.  The plot is great, watching him grow up to own a drug empire, as he deals with problems from customers, friends, and his own family.  It has good action too, better than almost any other film of its day in terms of gore and realism.  I don't really know what to say about this movie other than it is great, and has stood the test of time to be very successful.",

The film is actually a remake of the movie with the same name from 1932. This latest version was considered controversial due to the bad language, explicit violence and the hard drug usage. A must-see movie with a genius ending. If we can believe the rumors the leading roles were to go to Robert DeNiro and Glenn Close, but apparently they turned it down. 'Scarface' stars are Al Pacino (The Godfather) as druglord Tony Montana and Michelle Pfeiffer (What Lies Beneath) as Elvira Hancock, with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (The Abyss) and Steven Bauer. The world is yours... \n\nCuban refugee Tony Montana (Pacino) arrives in Miami with his best friend Manny Ray (Bauer), where the both of them kill a former Cuban government official at the request of a powerful drug dealer to get green cards.  The two of them start to work for Frank Lopez, who is impressed by their daring actions because the boys aren't afraid to use bloody violence to get what they want. They get invited to Frank's house where they meet his attractive girlfriend Elvira Hancock (Pfeiffer).  Tony climbs up the ladder and turns from a small criminal to a true drug kingpin.

Al Pacino out-does himself as Tony Montana, and makes the role very believable. This movie is 2/3's of being a total shoot-out action movie and the other 1/3 is filled with plot, deception and character build-ups. I think that is the perfect gangster movie and this movie does that so well. It has a lot of drug use and some violence that people may find disturbing so if you don't like violence or drugs, avoid this movie like a plague.

Obsession. \nWell that alone sums up of what you're going to get for the next 3 hours of the movie. \nThe problem is, people compare 'Scarface' as another 'Godfather'. No, that is injustice to both the movies, mixing them up like that. While 'Godfather' was a bit more artistic in it's approach of painting the picture of a Mafia family, Scarface is an open and more violent depiction of the mob.\n\nA political refugee from Cuba, Tony Montana builds his way from scratch and becomes a drug overlord. The later half of the film is all about how his greed and obsession for power brings him down. Brian DePalma and Oliver Stone's violent narrative of the story is a success. They have created a string of powerful and fascinating characters and blended them up in the perfect 'heavy' amount of profanity and graphic violence. It's a frank story with lots and lots of blood. \nTalking about the amount of profanity in the film, to be exact, it has the 'F' bomb used 226 times. Al Pacino leads the way for that. Now having said that, it's pretty much justified when a character says to Montana (Pacino) \" Can you please stop saying that all the time ?\"\nIt is also a bloodbath. There are a lot of killings, including a scene were a man is dismembered by a chainsaw, revenge killings, all of which leading up to the climax - the grand finale shootout. \nThere are a lot of drug uses too. Well the whole film is based on Montana's drug cartel empire. \nMoving on, now let's talk about Al Pacino. Al Pacino is unstoppable with yet another memorable and exciting performance. His character, Tony Montana is violent,confident and fearless. Montana is a vicious tiger. He mauls everything that comes in his way towards success. At the same time , his greed and obsession for power, addiction towards cocaine and his sense of over protectiveness towards his sister, leads to his fall and the eviction of his loved ones from his life, one by one.\nIt's a delight watching Al Pacino. He gets everything right and is just perfect in playing the violent kingpin.  Bravado!\nSupporting cast did a good job too. Steve Bauer as Montana's bestfriend and partner of his newly established empire, Michelle Pfieifer as his cocaine addicted wife and Robert Loggia as 'Frank Lopez'  the Miami drug lord, who Tony works for at first. \n\nA classic in the mob film genre. And one of Al Pacino's best performances.",

            "content": "\"I always tell the truth. Even when I lie.\"\n\nBrian DePalma's Scarface has become such a classic film over time and its main character (Al Pacino as Scarface) is such an iconic pop cultural figure that few people would believe that he was actually nominated for a Razzie for Worst Director in 1984. Scarface is yet another film that was perhaps misunderstood when it came out, but has built a solid cult following over time (it influenced a lot of rappers and hip hop artists during the 90's) and is recognized by the IMDB as one of the top 250 films. When it comes to gangster films this might not be as perfect as The Godfather I, II, or Goodfellas but it still ranks among the top 10 in the genre and it has become more popular over time. Despite having never seen the film in its entirety before, I was familiar with the ending. Everyone knows where the phrase \"Say hello to my little friend\" comes from despite never have seeing this film because the ending of Scarface is perhaps one of the best known scenes in cinema history. Scarface has so many memorable quotes that it's hard to choose one, and that is thanks to the great script written by Oliver Stone who loosely adapted it from a prior film. It is also such a memorable film thanks in most part to Al Pacino's masterful performance as Tony Montana. He has made so many great films in his career, but I think this character will always stand out a bit above the rest. For some critics his performance may be over the top, but I think he nailed it and that is why Montana has become such an iconic figure over time. There is something about him that has transcended time and cultures. It is an epic and ultra violent stylized film and that is why Al Pacino's over the top and loud performance worked so well. Scarface is about 170 minutes long but it never ceases to entertain for a second.\n\nDuring the Mariel harbor opening in Cuba more than 100,000 Cuban refugees were sent to the United States, one of those refugees happened to be communist hating ex military Tony Montana (Al Pacino). He has big dreams and high ambitions but upon his arrival he has to start off low. He and his friend, Manny (Steven Bauer) begin washing dishes when they are contacted by Omar Suarez (Murray Abraham) to make a business deal with some dangerous Colombians involving some drugs and money. Tony and Manny survive their mission and Omar introduces them to his boss, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia), a drug kingpin in Miami, who hires their services. Frank has it all: a big mansion, nice cars, and a beautiful wife named Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer); everything that Tony dreams of having in this new country. Tony is convinced that he will not stop until he gets what he wants and in doing so helping his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) with whom he had been separated during his prison stint in Cuba. The only problem is that he will have to make a lot of enemies on the way to the top.\n\nI really don't know what DePalma's true intentions were for Scarface. I don't believe he was trying to glorify Scarface because he was portrayed in a dark and negative light, but over time he has become sort of a role model for some people. Perhaps Al Pacino's performance was so strong that it made it easy for audience's to relate to this ambitious character. DePalma was able to make the audience care for this unstable and explosive character. On the one hand he refused to kill women and kids, but on the other he was able to kill his best friend without hesitation. Scarface does seem to walk a fine line between glorifying the character and showing how destructive ambition and excesses can be. This bleak mood set in the film can be seen through Pfeiffer's character, someone who has it all but seems completely unhappy with life. Even Tony himself once he achieves his goals seems to lose himself completely by these excesses. He hates seeing his sister with other men involved in the same business because he knows how ugly this life is. That is why I think DePalma was never trying to portray Scarface in a glorifying light, but over time his character has become admired by worldwide audiences. The film has a lot to say about ambition, loyalty, and betrayal, but above all it is a stylized ultra violent film that lacks the technical achievements that The Godfather had. It still remains as one of the great gangster and immigrant films of the 80's.",

            "content": "This movie came out five years before I was born and I would never hear about it till I was fifteen years old while attending my sophomore year in High School. It was when Universal released a twenty year anniversary DVD of the film, and when I first heard and saw bits and pieces of it, I didnât want to see it at all. But one day, I was watching TV, flipping through channels, and I came across it on a movie channel. So for the hell of it, I watched it and I really enjoyed it. The movie Iâm talking about is Director Brian De Palmaâs 1983 epic crime drama SCARFACE. Written by acclaimed filmmaker Oliver Stone and based on Director Howard Hawksâ 1932 film of the same name, the film tells the story of Tony Montana (Al Pacino), a Young, ambitious, and aggressive Cuban refugee who, along with his best friend Manolo âMannyâ Ribera (Steven Bauer), come to Florida in 1980 as a result of the Mariel Boatlift, and, intent on running Miamiâs Drug world. The duo begins to climb the ladder of the cocaine empire and after their successful journey to the top; the two learn that nothing can last forever. The film features a cast of familiar faces: Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns) as Tonyâs wife Elvira, Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (The Abyss) as Tonyâs beloved kid sister Gina, Robert Loggia (Independence Day) as aging drug lord Frank Lopez, Harris Yulin (Rush Hour 2) as the corrupt Miami cop Mel Bernstein, F. Murray Abraham (Amadeus) as Frankâs underboss Oscar Suarez, the late Paul Shenar (The Secret Life of NIMH) as the murderous Bolivian drug lord Alejandro Sosa, Mark Margolis (Ace Ventura: Pet Detective) and Geno Silva (1941) as Sosaâs henchmen Alberto the Shadow and The Skull. The film also features a brief uncredited appearance by a young Brett Ratner, the director of RUSH HOUR, as The Boy Lying on Raft in Pool. Although itâs Rated R, The movie was almost Rated X for its extreme violence, excessive strong language, and hard drug usage. Luckily, De Palma pulled in a panel of experts, including real narcotics officers, to convince twenty members of the Motion Picture Association of America that the film was an accurate portrayal of the real life drug underworld and should be widely seen. SCARFACE held its premiere in New York City on December 1st, 1983 where Pacino and Bauer, along with Martin Scorsese, Cher, Raquel Welch, Lucille Ball, Joan Collins, and a young Eddie Murphy and Diane Lane attended. The film was dedicated to Hawks and Ben Hecht, who were the writers of the original film. The best scene for me would have to be when Tony, in a cocaine-fueled rage, takes on Sosaâs hit men with a M16A1 assault rifle at his mansion, where it starts with Tony saying âSay Hello to My Little Friend!â and it ends fantastically. Despite the fact of the filmâs critical response to its violence and graphic language of that time, SCARFACE is a cult classic and to me, one of the greatest movies of all time.",

I don't believe in using fancy terms, in describing this movie in film makers jargon, instead I'll try to tell you my opinion of this fine film, the greatest gangster film, and one of the greatest films period, ever made. This is the movie that shows us Al Pacino's first role where he really comes into maturity as an actor in his early 40s. The supporting cast is phenomenal, The score is timeless, so is the message, 'the world is yours'. \n\nThis film is shot so well, the tension thought  the film is superb, you get mesmorised by the colour, as you hear the songs that will stay with you forever. The acting is 2nd to none, it's perfection in every scene. \n\nThe greatest achievement above all else, is that the film familiarizes the viewer with a ruthless Tony Montana, and despite his shortcomings as a person, we learn that he's still a loving, moral man who would rather die than to take away an innocent life. I cry and feel the deepest sadness whenever i see the ending of Scarface, and the dead Tony Montana. You learn to really care for this ruthless man, even mourn his demise. Its in this achievement alone that makes Scarface a film above all others, but a handful in the history of cinema. Its the rise and fall of a man who chose to forge his own mark upon society, only to throw it away to uphold his morality, and values. \n\nAl Pacino has only made one other film to surpass this in his acting ability and that's Scent of a Woman, and if that wasn't made, then this would remain his greatest performance. A performance that will echo into eternity. Please watch this 83' masterpiece at least 3-5 times by which time you will see for yourself just how timeless Scarface really is!",

            "content": "Oliver Stone and Brian De Palma came together to make what is now considered a classic by many of the gangster genre, combining Oliver Stone's somewhat B-movie script with endlessly quotable dialogue with De Palma's elegant and fast paced directing.\n\nIt all starts with a mini-documentary of the Mariel boatlift accompanied by an amazing deep soundtrack and one of the cuban refugees is Tony Montana (Al Pacino) being interrogated and making jokes the whole time, he's a ballsy guy and he's ambitious. He only cares for his best friend Manny (Steven Bauer), with whom he shares his ambitions, and his sister, Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), apart from that he doesn't feel for anyone else and will stop at nothing to get everything he wants.\n\nI wouldn't classify it a gangster film, because even though it is in that genre, De Palma makes a different type of gangster film where he makes them feel more human. I think its more the rise and fall of a man who wrongly thought money and power would make him feel complete.\n\nAl Pacino's performance is in my opinion his best of all time, his performance is one of those like Robert De Niro's in \"Raging Bull\" where he becomes the character and he becomes Tony Montana, not Al Pacino playing Tony Montana.\n\nThe script is loosely based on Oliver Stone's addiction to cocaine, which makes the film a lot more personal turning it into more of a character study than anything else. I wonder if the rise and fall story was in some way influenced by \"Barry Lyndon\" which I believe started that kind of story in film and was followed by many others like \"Goodfellas\", \"Casino\", and \"Blow\". I also think that Brian De Palma influenced a big part on Quentin Tarantino's movie making technique in the way he takes from other films, breaks some rules and turns it into something new.",

He's got that insane rage that he hasn't lost but he also still has that youthful look of mercilessly hunting out justice- however skewed his character's form of justice may be in this one. It's also got the character transformation elements that films like The Godfathers and Serpico have to some degree or another.\r\n\r\nThis one is very 80s (or very \"GTA Vice City\" as 90's kids like me call it) and it's almost funny now to see violent shootings scenes followed by joyous 80's moments with \"Push It To The Limit\" playing over them. It all adds to the joyous insanity of it all though. It's over-the-top but so is Montana and his dreams in every way so it fits perfectly. \r\n\r\nIt could probably have done with some trimming in the editing room- a faster pace certainly would have produced a stronger effect, but the scenes are still all relatively entertaining. It's hard to believe how popular this film still is today- it's probably not an exaggeration to say that 1 in every ten rap songs has a Scarface reference in there somewhere. My favourite, I hear you not asking? \r\n\r\n\"Stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock, working overtime for making money for the crack spot. Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine, fulfilling the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain\" - Immortal Technique\r\n\r\nAnyway, enough of me showing how cool I am (or just being a prick who wastes your time by going off on a tangent) but my point is that this film is such a definitive one- it's a real \"movie\" movie, a gritty blockbuster. Whatever you wanna call it- it's done well! I think that that's a result of certain outstanding scenes and general ideas in the film rather than the finished product itself though. It's still great but you really have to be a fan- it's one you keep watching because you love it not because it's the best thing you'll ever watch, but just because you love it. \r\n\r\nIt's certainly a go with the flow kind of thing and I think if you view it like that, it won't disappoint but if you are looking for something more from this, which it's reputation suggests you will get, then I'm not sure you'll be fully satisfied in the end. I don't judge it on it's reputation though, I judge it on how much of an experience it is- how it feels to watch, and for that, it's great indeed.\r\n\r\nWhat I will say though, is that you have to be a Pacino fan to some extent for this one- I honestly can't imagine someone who isn't a fan of him enjoying this one. It's the Pacino show really and anyone who dislikes Pacino probably has this on their lists of the most over-rated movies. When it comes to me though, I take pleasure in trying to perfect my Montana impression (it's still horrendously bad) and I one day hope to go around bars using it and see how many times I get a knife pulled on me- so I think that means I like it. (or I'm crazy enough to love this movie anyway.)",

            "content": "Scarface is often held up at the quintessential violent gangster film. While The Godfather series is arguably the most revered gangster saga, Scarface is the film whose posters adorn student walls and whose many quotable scenes are a meme generator's wet dream. But after 30 years, the film that took so long to become cool has started to lose some of its sheen, and is now, for good and bad, the epitome of 1980s indulgence.\n\nScarface was a watershed for many a career. For Al Pacino, this performance can be seen as the beginning of his over-the-top streak, which slowly but surely started to erode his technique and which has rarely been reigned in since Scent of a Woman. For Oliver Stone, it was the film which launched his career: a few short years later he was the toast of Hollywood, directing Platoon and Wall Street and penning The Untouchables. And for Brian De Palma, it marks the point where his love of visual extravagance began to dominate his sense of discipline; his later works are, for the most part, a never-ending pursuit of style with little time or care for substance.\n\nIn remaking the 1932 film by Howard Hawks, Stone and De Palma shift the setting from Chicago to Florida and change the central crime from bootlegging alcohol to shipping cocaine. The original was modelled around the real-life gangster Al Capone - who allegedly liked the film so much that he bought one of the original prints. But while both films feature a protagonist who rises to the top by running his former bosses out of town, this version adds the twist of our lead being a foreigner. In making Tony Montana a Cuban immigrant, the filmmakers are attempting some kind of satire of the American dream, in which anyone can come to America and make it as a successful businessman.\n\nAt least, you'd like to think so. In reality Scarface is far more interested in how best to shoot excess or bloodbaths than it is in offering any insights into their cause, repercussions or wider meanings. No-one can deny De Palma's brilliance in terms of cinematography and choreography, not to mention his use of Giorgio Moroder's famous score. But once you stop admiring how well a given shot is framed, or how sleazy Pacino looks, there isn't a great deal more going on to justify the running time. In short, the film has all the style in the world, and all the depth of a teaspoon.\n\nTo put it another way, this is how The Godfather I & II would have looked, had Francis Ford Coppola only been interested in period detail. While both parts are longer than Scarface, clocking in at around 3 hours each, Coppola's films are better-paced, have much more nuanced characters and have a far greater amount of depth. Even in its slowest, quietest, least consequential moments, The Godfather series had a lot to say about family dynamics, the position of outsiders, the role of crime in American history and the corruption of the human soul. Scarface looks lavish and excessive, but it has nothing to say beyond the old adage that crime doesn't pay.\n\nPart of the problem is that the film is incredibly episodic. It takes an awfully long time to set up Tony Montana, and an equally long time to go through the familiar motions of a gangster story: the initial encounters, the rapid rise, the enjoyment of one's success turning to hubris, and the fall from grace. The film is one of many memorable moments which loosely connect together until the last 20 minutes - which might help to explain why it is so easily quotable. You might say that this this is the closest we got to a Quentin Tarantino film before Quentin Tarantino; certainly the violence rivals anything in Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction.\n\nOne of the big disappointments of Scarface is that De Palma doesn't make a great deal out of the modern-day setting. This is surprising considering what a political filmmaker Stone is: you would expect him to use an event like the Havana boatlift as a springboard for some kind of commentary on race relations or American politics. The opening montage is very well-assembled, so that we cannot tell whether we are watching actual news footage or fake footage shot on different formats (something that Stone is known to do). But after this there is little or no attempt made to tie Montana's story into wider ideas about immigration, police corruption or the influence of Latin America on American crime.\n\nMore than any other film of the 1980s, Scarface raises the question: at what point does depicting excess become revelling in excess? We're not just talking about the impressively stylised violence, but also the lifestyle enjoyed by Montana, Sosa and the other characters. The film's narrative arc and unlikeable, sleazy characters would seem to support the argument that the visual excess demonstrates how bankrupt their lifestyle is. But this is somewhat undermined by the many long, wide-angle establishing shots which show off the characters' wealth. The director may not approve, but the camera is in love with the money.\n\nUltimately the visual style of Scarface is enough to drive the film over the line of ambivalence. We're still left with plenty of questions about the intentions of the film, but the experience of watching it is so full-on that these concerns are not always at the forefront of our minds. The film is operatic in scale and intent, with every scene playing on big emotions and impulse where The Godfather thrived on subtlety and nuance. It's not hard to see the influence of the film in contemporary music videos, with the 'push it to the limit' montage being a good example of what was to come.\n\nAccepting the operatic nature of Scarface is in many ways the secret to appreciating it. We could sit there looking at our watches, wondering where cuts could have been made or whether in real life the characters would behave like this. Or we can take the grandiosity and indulgence at face value, seeing them as extensions of the acting style and regarding the film as a hallucinogenic trip. The film unwittingly draws us into the same high as the characters, and our discomfort and desire for things to be over is as much out of objective frustration as it is a shared subjective experience.\n\nIf we allow ourselves to be seduced by Scarface's repulsive extravagance, the performances begin to feel like more than pantomime tomfoolery. In any other context Al Pacino would come across as a ham, but Tony Montana is so larger-than-life, so much a symbol rather than an individual, that he holds our attention even in his nastiest, scuzziest moments. Paul Shenar is terrific as Alejandro Sosa, conveying genuine threat while keeping suave and restrained. And Michelle Pfeiffer manages to make the best out of what is essentially a nothing role. Pfeiffer would later joke that she won her part when she accidentally cut Pacino with a plate during her screen test.\n\nHaving flannelled around and drawn itself out for so long, Scarface really starts to gather pace and reward its audience in the final act. The last 20 minutes are worth the price of admission alone, as all the different aspects of Tony's life begin to collapse and the film begins to focus on what little it has been trying to say all alone. In these last few scenes the screen is veritably dripping with cocaine, and we find ourselves in the middle of Tony's desperate and tragic high. The final fire-fight is very well-orchestrated and the pay-off is both memorable and blackly funny.\n\nScarface is a bloated and indulgent epic which leaves its audience enthralled, exhausted and ambivalent all at once. Enjoying it involves suspending a great deal of critical judgement, treating the film as an experience rather than an analysis, and for all its memorable moments it is ultimately very shallow. But for all its many flaws and excesses, it remains an essential watch, for those who can last the distance and tolerate its reckless showboating.",

There is never a clear focus on what the movie wants to do but it's core works surprisingly well with the portrayl of this detestable character and it's eminent downfall. You know how it will end but the ride to get there is handled with expertise and variety. Typical 80s feel all over and a movie that probably sums up this decade of Hollywood the best.",

            "content": "Al Pacino gives one of the many outstanding performances of his career with this immensely powerful, morally depraved rags-to-riches gangster classic and remake of the 1932 movie of the same name. Forged with a gritty, profane, and excellently paced screenplay by Oliver Stone, director Brian DePalma films with confidence and style to create a memorably brutal and heavy-handed depiction of a Cuban immigrant's obsession with power that leads him down a path of destruction. Upon the immigration of over one hundred thousand Cubans to Miami by decree of Fidel Castro in 1980, many of them criminals released from Cuban prisons, the drug trade becomes increasingly prevalent and dangerous within the city, drawing in the opportunistic and aggressive Tony Montana, who quickly ascends in rank and notoriety. Montana is street-smart, over-confident, and has a volatile temper, not letting anyone or anything get in his way, making him a both likable and distasteful character played to perfection like no one else could by the great Pacino. He starts out as a chef working in a meal shack to becoming one of the biggest cocaine suppliers in the country, complete with his crew of fellow immigrants, including Manny, his womanizing, talkative best friend and right-hand man who develops feelings for Tony's little sister, Gina despite Tony's warning and protective nature toward her. When tony starts out in the business, he works for a wealthy supplier named Frank, a relaxed, aging Cuban who takes a liking to Tony, while Tony sets his sights on Frank's mistress, Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer), an alluring junkie who finds Tony repulsive at first, but joins Tony when he eliminates Frank and builds himself an empire. Boasting potent performances from the entire cast, a handful of intense and infamously violent scenes, and peppered with social commentary on the American economy and the elusive American Dream, Scarface is a tale of furious, drug-crazed proportions that closes its power saga with one of the greatest shootouts in movie history.",

It's in many ways an old fashioned film, even telling a very key part of it's story using the type of montage you see in films from the 30's and 40's.  All of the 80's gloss and extreme violence is layered on a plot that's beat for beat the same as Hawks's film.  Pacino's performance has often been ridiculed for being oh so very big, but I'm not sure what anybody should expect in a portrayal of Tony Montana.  He's a character almost completely lacking an inner life who subsists entirely by bluffing and and convincing others that he's stronger than them.  He's all action without thought.",

If it were paced better this would be a lot better in my opinion. Anyway, i think gangsters and the vibe of the 1980s go pretty good together at the right time, other time it's just cheesy.",

Finally seeing it, I was underwhelmed -- it isn't a masterpiece although there are some pretty amazing set-pieces where everyone pulls out all the stops.  The tracking and panning camera glides everywhere to the now-dated Giorgio Moroder soundtrack (which nevertheless fits the Miami 1980s milieu perfectly). Pacino, well, Pacino chews the scenery.  Unfortunately, as we approached 3 hours, Scarface became something of a hard slog -- Pacino himself is worn out by drugs, violence, power, and paranoia -- and so was I.  As a result, the climactic battle plays more like a videogame than a truly engaging comeuppance.   Still, the film scores points for its imaginative transplanting of the Hawks-Hecht 1932 version to Little Havana and the 80s coke binge.",

Now, those three reasons right there are good enough to recommend \"Scarface\" to anyone that hasn't seen it, but there's not much else about the film that's worth talking about. There are instances where the screen is crackling with tension and stylistic filmmaking, but more often than not, the film feels sluggish and drawn out. This can be attributed to Brian De Palma's much-criticized direction, which is a mixed bag. There are about five or six well-handled sequences that are memorable and, at times, suspenseful, but a lot of times, it seems like he doesn't really know what to do with the material. This occurs mainly during the film's second half, after Montana has gained full control of the drug trade. Scenes designed to give us insight into his character just aren't that interesting because De Palma doesn't direct them as intensely as he should have. The music hasn't dated all too well but it doesn't harm the film as much as others have said. (Of course, I'm excluding the \"Push It to the Limit\" sequence because it goes without saying how cheesy that part is.) I won't say that I didn't enjoy \"Scarface\" because I did; it's just that it isn't a great film or even one of the classic gangster films. I'd say that it's worth watching for the three reasons stated above and because of its overall influence on the crime genre, which is just massive.",

Definitivamente el Ã (C)xito de este filme se marca en la intersecciÃ³n de tres talentos: La direcciÃ³n de Brian de Palma, el guiÃ³n de Oliver Stone y por supuesto la ya mencionada actuaciÃ³n de Al Pacino. Y realmente el resto del elenco es merecedor de elogios en donde no solo actores que no son latinos, logran personificar caracteres cubanos, incluyendo el acento y el lenguaje, sino que Michelle Pfeiffer debuta de forma magistral agregando valor adicional a esta compleja historia. Es un filme muy diferente en donde el personaje principal estÃ¡ lleno de defectos y realmente no cambia mucho, sino es para empeorar en sus decisiones, y que a la vez en interesante siempre cuando aunque sean desalmados en muchas de sus acciones sin embargo marcan una lÃ­nea donde no van a cruzar y no la cruzan no importa las mortales repercusiones que impliquen. Un filme que ademÃ¡s sirve para mostrar el siguiente paso en la evoluciÃ³n del crimen organizado en Estados Unidos posterior a la Ã (C)poca del Padrino (50s a 70s), aquÃ­ precisamente muestran el acenso de los latinos en los 80s como factor dominante en la criminalidad de Estados Unidos. Y sin duda, una pelÃ­cula que ofrece un desenlace brutalmente violento como solo el cine puede ofrecer.",
