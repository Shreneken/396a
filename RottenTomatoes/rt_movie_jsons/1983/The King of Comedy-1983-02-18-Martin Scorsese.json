    "summary": "Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) is a failure in life but a celebrity in his own mind, hosting an imaginary talk show in his mother's basement. When he meets actual talk show host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis), he's convinced it will provide his big break, but Langford isn't interested in the would-be comedian. Undaunted, Pupkin effectively stalks Langford -- and when that doesn't work, he kidnaps him, offering his release in exchange for a guest spot on Langford's show.",

            "content": "\"Better to be king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime\"\n\nThe King of Comedy is a more relevant film than ever in our current age. I have heard countless times that this film is a \"better Joker\", and while I don't like to compare films in centered reviews I think this is everything Joker tried to be (in some sense.) The dangers of celebrity worship and idealistic values are prevalent all throughout history, and in another Scorsese masterpiece, these themes are explored. Rupert Pupkin is selfish, egotistical, disturbed, and everything else you'd expect out of his character. Robert De Niro gives one of his finest performances playing this disturbed individual, he is consistently on point and fully believable. Sandra Bernhard is also incredible here, as she plays another crazed fan in Masha. Rupert constantly believes he is above her when it comes to his character and his position, but in reality, they are two sides of the same coin. Jerry Lewis has less to do has the comedian Jerry Langford, but he does enough to make you feel sorry and sympathetic for him. From a technical perspective, this film is on point, there are a few strange editing cuts but I was never taken out or taken aback by truly anything in this film. It'd be remiss of me not to talk about the ending, as it is one of the most impactful endings I've seen in any film, Scorsese or not. Whatever your interpretations are of sed ending, it is disturbing and equally bleak. The King of Comedy manages to stay relevant all of these years later, it holds up as a flawless masterpiece that exhibits themes that are as equally disturbing as they are compelling.",

            "content": "Scorsese's work style has always been fluid and ephemeral; he entered the apex of his career with Taxi Driver, a film with a strong experimental bent, and with Raging Bull, he developed a distinctively frigid picture style. This period's King of Comedy, however, is a mature work of appropriate discipline, a dark drama of incisive societal satire. \n\nSince the mid-1970s, in response to the social and cultural instability in the United States, Scorsese's creative trend has been social, that is, he uses pictures to convey societal critique. While \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Raging Bull\" were deeply gloomy antiheroics, \"The King of Comedy\" was a humorous take on TV culture's propensity to coddle. Parkin desired to become a TV chat show star when his idol ignored him, his admirers abducted his idol, and he lost the chance to perform on stage in exchange for fame. Parkin is a very neurotic man, and the film employs a great deal of bizarre speech to convey this. Parkin is full of self-righteousness and drunk by his particular fantasy from the outset. This scenario is an abstraction of typical American achievement, and after resting his expectations on his idol Langford, Parkin finally dashed his aspirations. The following insanity of Parkin is representative of the post-Vietnam mentality of the United States, in which the individual's battle against society becomes an extreme and foolish measure. Scorsese's film is on the impact of a monotonous television culture as well as the desperation of individual inhabitants. Scorsese's approach is measured and controlled, and his depiction is amusing without being kitsch. Initially, the characters' conduct is exaggerated, so enriching and exaggerating the social reality. In addition, all the performances are genuine and represent the characters' self-catharsis in this type of atmosphere and character. Parkin sharing the stage with superstars in his vision and receiving the acclaim of the crowd, or Langford confronting the loud inquiry of the daily program and audience abuse, are thus the director's personal portrayal of the actual society. And employs the style in which reality and fiction alternately emerge, so enhancing the comedic meaning with a sort of confused dislocation and the satirical potency. The ultimate conclusion is also a form of comparative irony, in that it is difficult to determine the veracity of this dream, the offered optimism becomes a form of helplessness, and the seemingly mundane reunion is actually concealed. \n\nThe King of Comedy is an extremely somber film in terms of its cinematography. Scorsese utilized the conventional American cinema technique, as he himself stated, with no close-ups and no documentation-type pronouncements. Therefore, the entire film has a fairly consistent, objective point of view. The filming style that Scorsese devised during this era is closely tied to his social subject matter, with Raging Bull focused on the visual setting while The King of Comedy is much more prosthetic. The majority of the presented mirror pictures originate from the creator's own perspective, which not only shows what they have observed, such as following photos on the street, easy switching, and scene browsing, but also pays closer attention to observers' eyes. Mr. De Niro and Mr. Scorsese, fresh off the tough ride of \"Raging Bull,\" especially from the weariness of his tremendous weight gain, continue to perform admirably, and he is as adept at the pompous comedy, even if he overacts in several parts. Jerry Lewis provides a flawless performance, cracks hilarious jokes, and delivers wonderful impromptu statements. The film replicated the television production process of the era in an attempt to make the fictitious show appear as realistic as feasible. \n\nThis film represents the culmination of Scorsese's creative process. Personal motivation and accomplishment will eventually confront roadblocks and bottlenecks when reaching the summit. A somewhat tranquil and mature work might serve as a moderator, therefore defining the style, which is to ponder with personal pictures and critique society.",

The film tells the story of a mentally ill loner yet sympathetic character (played by Robert De Niro) who just wants to be a famous comedian. The film has some amazing acting from Robert De Niro, Jerry Lewis, and Sandra Bernhard. Speaking of amazing, the cinematography by Fred Schuler was not only amazing but was very nuanced at times. Despite the film being a dark comedy satire showing how destructive groupie culture can bring horrendous consequences within our society, it had some funny moments even for a Martin Scorsese who previously did Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. What should also deserve some praise was the subtle costume designs. The King of Comedy is more than just a film. It's a philosophical debate that involves our own critical thinking. Is it ideal or real? Is it in my mind? Do the ends justify the means? Martin Scorsese did a wonderful job creating this underrated film.",

            "content": "Perhaps the single most significant film to demonstrate the range of both De Niro as an actor and Scorsese as a director, so distinct is The King of Comedy from rest of the output of both, particularly in their early careers. \n\nPeople remark about how spot-on Paul D. Zimmerman's script was in predicting the lure of media and the forgiveness that recognizability alone inspires, but to me there is one particular aspect of the film and television industry that this film taps into - the insertion of themselves as a 'friend' to the viewer. TV wanted to make themselves hard to shake, so they reached out into the living rooms of their audience and sat themselves down at the dinner table. The King of Comedy feels so unnerving (and works so well; it should be called 'Secondhand Embarassment: The Movie) because it focuses on an individual who has taken that affection and returns it with confidence and gusto. There's a fine line between stick-to-it-iveness and a disturbing inability to understand social cues, a breaking of unspoken moral codes that people don't anticipate and are severely put off by, that makes the film effective.\n\nGreat performances (from De Niro and particularly Bernhard), a sense of delicious, darkly comic irony, and a prescient social understanding make The King of Comedy an unexpectedly brilliant piece of work, particularly in light of the stark differences to other projects that the big names had been attached to. (4/5)",

            "content": "Absurd cringe comedy from dramatic star Robert De Niro and crime auteur Martin Scorsese!\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese's black comedy The King of Comedy (1982) is a thoroughly misunderstood gem of biting satire and psychological breakdown of celebrity stalkers and desperate entertainers. Scorsese laughs at the cruelty and insanity of the chaotic entertainment industry from ultra fans frothing at the mouth of average late night hosts to the stalkers who have no boundaries or respect for their idol's privacy, time, or opinion. \n\nAll Robert De Niro's  Rupert Pupkin wants is validation from his pathetic, worthless existence and Scorsese clearly understands that this character is all cringe, horror, deception, and potential for violence. The King of Comedy is quite funny in how absurd every scene is, to the point of Scorsese directing vividly ridiculous surrealist dream sequences with Rupert's wish fulfillment, as the joke is always on De Niro's Rupert Pupkin. Scorsese ensures The King of Comedy is entertaining and stylish with a directorial knowledge Todd Phillips' Joker only wishes he could inspire such originality and slickness.\n\nWriter Paul D. Zimmerman's script lambasts Hollywood, late night television programs, obsessive celebrity stalkers, failed stand-up comedians, and rabid fans whose celebrity worship borders on mental illness and personal delusions. Breaking it big in show business requires years of hard work in smaller venues to establish yourself, being born rich, or having connections who can pull strings to streamline your path to stardom. The King of Comedy hilariously provides an alternative path wherein you can kidnap and blackmail your way to fame with godspeed if you're psychotic and persistent enough. \n\nI love how Zimmerman's writing shows how pathetic, desperate, lonely, impoverished, forceful, and obnoxious Robert De Niro's funnily named Rupert Pupkin is at all times. You never think this guy will be genuinely funny in De Niro's neat impression of Rodney Dangerfield in The King of Comedy's finale comedy stand-up routine for 10 minutes. De Niro blasts his way through conversations with incessant talking and pushing his awful comedy towards anyone who will listen one way or the other. It's a neat parallel to Travis Bickle's social awkwardness in Taxi Driver with Jake LaMotta's brute bullying capabilities in Raging Bull. Robert De Niro truly can act in any role, even inspiring Joaquin Phoenix' Joker in combination with Heath Ledger's Joker.\n\nEditor Thelma Schoonmaker clearly has had a profound impact on Martin Scorsese's already fearsome directorial prowess. She even produced The King of Comedy! Her startling apt cuts keep The King of Comedy progressing steadily for 109 minutes into Rupert's descent into ruthless cunning and a hilarious crime spree. I love how she splices Scorsese's dream sequences with Rupert's daytime delusions seamlessly, so that you don't even realize what you're watching at first.\n\nRupert's socially awkward conversations with Jerry Lewis' deadpan and visibly frustrated late night host Jerry Langford are so funny as Thelma rarely cuts the cringe dialogue and creepy interactions Rupert has with everyone. Jerry Lewis is excellent as you can see him take each moment seriously with this unsurprised nonchalance and clear fury at how Jerry Langford's fans never let him rest in peace.\n\nSandra Bernhard steals the show as the relentless stalker Masha, who has deluded herself into falling in love with Jerry Lewis. Bernhard's blaring yelling at Rupert's repulsive ineffectiveness in properly getting Jerry's attention is a delight to watch. Her every line is killer and only she could have pulled off that cringe kidnapping seduction dinner scene so funnily. I always thought she was hilarious in Hudson Hawk too as the villainess alongside Richard E. Grant. Diahnne Abbott is believable as the tired bartender sick of Rupert's cringe advances and horrified by his intrusive behavior. I liked Martin Scorsese's cameo as one of Jerry's crew with his off the cuff manner.\n\nFred Schuler's striking cinematography uses wide shots to show just how few people really find Rupert Pupkin funny and how isolated he is in his life and mind. All of Schuler's centered framed shots are so beautiful. The King of Comedy has visually held up wonderfully. From these on foot chase sequences that are shot down real New York streets as the camera flies by characters to the quiet little moments in Jerry's office with his secretaries, The King of Comedy lets you in on the joke at all times.\n\nBoris Leven's production designs play around with Rupert's colorful home show set to Jerry's dark blue late night set with a strange aesthetic that makes The King of Comedy all the stranger and more fun. Edward Pisoni and Lawrence Miller's art direction matches seas of audiences laughing at and along with Rupert to all these imaginative scenarios of delusions from Rupert. George DeTitta Sr. and Daniel Robert's set decoration looks like real homes and sets, while the office is curiously cold and distant like the world of Hollywood was never in Rupert's grasp to begin with really.\n\nComposer Robbie Robertson's score is quite playful and silly, which fits perfectly for the chaotic and insane nature of The King of Comedy. Dick Vorisek, Frank E. Warner, and Tom Fleischman's sound design is quite creative as audience voices will echo with laughter as disembodied voices from beyond the camera to in the room audiences bursting with hysterical chuckles at Rupert's jokes. Richard Bruno and William Loger's costumes are hideous and unflattering on every single person and that's the joke. Philip Goldblat's make-up is quite realistic as each person looks normal and sweaty.\n\nIn short, The King of Comedy is worth a watch only if you can stomach super cringe-inducing comedy and have a bit of a dark sense of humor.",

The film endorses itself, comically tragic and famously opinionated, in the sense that the film speaks the inner voice of the common man. And it is a timeless classic. Perhaps this is why, even decades later when Todd Phillips commands the very subject in Joker, the topic feels fresh and is trending like any other hip and happening theme in this post social media era. But what's to note here, is that the fame has always been this cryptic mythical entity that everyone wishes to crack in a night. The hangover is too heavy to be shaken off by someone or something from the outside.\n\nAnd this is what the first half of the director Martin Scorsese's ambitious and controversial project runs on. And it is a very slow and steady procedure that he wants us to go through, almost like a therapy. Even the dream like sequences where Rupert Pupkin played by Robert De Niro assumes only the ideal situation. In those scenarios too, that are actually installed to speak more about the characters and its ideologies, De Niro is repetitively whipped by the dose of reality to see the line differentiating right and wrong.\n\nAnd his entire character is based on that blurred factor that he is incapable of recognizing. Even in his stand up bits, the one-liners and the stories he mocks is just showcasing the sadistic outward look that he has towards his own life. And that is why we feel empathetic towards The King Of Comedy. For he is self obsessed. He doesn't account other's life and hence also doesn't have a sadistic approach towards their priorities or importance. This thrown penny that is seen in De Niro's panache is hungrily grabbed by us, it represents that tiny part of our life that we all dream of.",

Now, Starship Troopers (1997) and American Beauty (1999), unfortunately tainted by Kevin Spacey, would also rank highly on my hypothetical ranking of satirical films but I think that The King of Comedy nails the entertainment industry and people's relationship to celebrity in a way that few other films do. After having seen Raging Bull (1980) I thought that there was no way that De Niro could top that performance but here he is even more hopeless and desperate and yet in some ways the perfect embodiment of the American dream, he is very different but equally good in this role and the lack of attention that this film receives is criminal.\n\nRupert Pupkin, Robert De Niro, is an aspiring stand-up comedian obsessed with talk show host Jerry Langford, Jerry Lewis, whom he is able to meet one night after a taping of the show. His obsession only grows worse and he continuously pursues Langford in the hopes of appearing on his television show despite the star's obvious lack of interest. Helping him in his pursuit is his wealthy but equally mentally unstable friend Masha, Sandra Bernhard, who harbors romantic feelings for Langford. He is unfettered in his pursuit and continues chasing his dreams through a series of increasingly more terrifying attempts but his horrible acts appear to have only positive outcomes, at least from what we see which may or may not be his delusions.\n\nThe reason that it worked so well for me is that it was able to make you feel intensely uncomfortable but also to see how little people care about the person behind the celebrity and how willing people are to commit horrible acts just to get a piece of it. Unlike The Player (1992) which left me utterly cold I was horrified throughout the running time of this film as we see an innocent man get tortured so that a maniac can have one night of stardom. The scenes in which De Niro is fantasizing about serving as a talk show host alongside Langford are particularly terrifying as the dialogue resembles the tone of a late night talk show and the various gags that Pupkin imagines feel as though they could be ripped right out of the Late Late Show. His final comedy routine is also perfectly tailored to the style of a late night comic on a family friendly TV show, his jokes aren't particularly funny but they are referential and they sound like something that Jimmy Fallon, ugh, would spew. The audience eats up this routine however, in the way that middle Americans appear to love Fallon, and Pupkin is a strange success a fiction that doesn't feel so far from the truth. This \u00e2~believability' allowed me to cringe throughout but also to understand what the film was trying to say about the shallowness of the entertainment industry.\n\nAll of the performances are just wonderful and as I have already mentioned how great De Niro I will now expound on why Bernhard and Lewis are just terrific. Bernhard plays a completely mad woman and she makes you believe it, when she is discussing her mental illness with Langford we get the sense that this is a woman with many, many mental issues and that Langford is just a person she can take her issues out on. Her rambling style of speech, slurred words and ability to jump from being in a fevered frenzy to being eerily calm lend her character a fearsome unpredictability and make her a worthy sidekick to De Niro. Lewis is great as a pragmatic, scared but successful comic and you feel sick for him as a crazed individual chooses him as a victim. He is particularly good when being tortured by Bernhard and De Niro as his bespectacled eyes betray his fear. Diahnne Abbott, De Niro's wife at the time of filming, is also good as De Niro's girlfriend who is terribly humiliated when she is brought to Langford's holiday home under the pretense of a vacation then informed that her boyfriend is not wanted and her shock at his success later in the film mirrors the audience reaction. It is again a travesty that De Niro and Bernhard received almost no attention for their brilliant work in this film.\n\nI would certainly recommend this film, not because it is fun but because it really comments on the nature of fame and the fickleness of the industry and the public at large. Pupkin's last line in his stand-up routine \"Tomorrow you'll know I wasn't kidding and you'll all think I'm crazy. But I figure it this way: better to be king for a night, than a schmuck for a lifetime\" is a criticism of the dangerous ideology of the entertainment industry itself. This is his fourth greatest film because it analyses existential, social and political issues whilst being terrifyingly deadpan.",

            "content": "In the cannon of Martin Scorsese films, this one stands apart. The film does feature Robert De Niro in the lead, is set in NYC, and includes many of Scorsese's regular behind the camera crew members, but in terms of visuals and drawing attention not the camera, \"The King of Comedy\" represents Scorsese at his most subdued. In this film, Robert De Niro creates one of his most fascinating characters with Rupert Pupkin,  a obsessive fan of late night talkshow host Jerry Langford, a wickedly good Jerry Lewis. Pupkin stalks Langford after shows, sets up his own talkshow set in him parents' basement, and is self deluded enough to believe he has a real personal relationship with Langford. The story is a serviceable one for a comedy, but where Scorsese and the cast shine is in the darkness they bring to the comedy. Taken on it's own, the script is not necessarily that dark and in lesser hands might have been a light breezy comedy. De Niro makes Pupkin a likable character, even if it does appear that he must be mentally ill, and never plays him for broad or overt comedy, yet delivers what is at times a hilarious performance. Jerry Lewis gives what has to be the best performance of his career as Langford, a character that I'm certain allowed him to tap into his personal experience with obsessive fans, balancing his need to be kind to his public while also protecting his own privacy. It would be easy to write Langford off as the villain of the piece, the guy who continually shuns Puplkin and won't give him his big break, but Lewis brings a reality to the part where you feel bad for him and almost understand why he's a bit of a jerk when having to deal with crazed fans. The scene were Langford walks down a busy NYC street and politely greets fans, says canned witty retorts he's said a million times before, and in the end really just wants to get where he's going is pure cinematic magic. When the one woman at a phone booth begs him to speak to her nephew Morris and Langford politely says he's running late, how quickly she turns on him saying, \"You should only get cancer! I hope you get cancer!\" is hilarious and at the same time extremely sad for Langford, who has likely experienced this many times before. While Scorsese makes his visual presence not as pronounced in \"The King of Comedy,\" his sensibilities still pervade this a dark comic classic.",

            "content": "GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED, ALL-AMERICAN FUN - My Review of THE KING OF COMEDY (5 Stars) \n\nSince Jerry Lewis died on August 20, it seemed only fitting to rewatch the 35th Anniversary screening of THE KING OF COMEDY on Labor Day.  Having been raised watching him on the Muscular Dystrophy Telethons every year on that holiday, I thought it fitting to honor him by revisiting what I feel is his greatest acting achievement.\n\nInitially a box office bomb and largely ignored by critics, this prescient film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by the late Paul D. Zimmerman, a former NEWSWEEK film critic, is right up there with NETWORK and A FACE IN THE CROWD in predicting the onslaught of crazy or untalented people achieving fame and power. Sound familiar in this age of social media stars and Presidents?  I also think it's Scorsese's best film and Robert DeNiro's greatest performance to date.  It also brought us a blazing, unforgettable performance by Sandra Bernhard in her debut.  Did I also mention it's one of my favorite, squirm-inducing, funcomfortable, funny/sad anti-comedy comedies of all time?  Since I wasn't in the game of writing movie reviews when it was first released, I thought it appropriate to take a stab at it now.\n\nDeNiro plays Rupert Pupkin, an aspiring standup comic who lives with his mother and makes money as a messenger in NYC.  He idolizes Jerry Langford (Lewis), a Johnny Carson-esque late night talk show host, and dreams of a slot on his show as a ticket to instant stardom.  God forbid Rupert should pay his dues and go to every open mic night available.  Instead, he practices his appearances on the show in his basement, complete with cardboard cutouts of Langford and guest Liza Minnelli.  Every now and then, his daydreams get interrupted by the voice of his mother (a hilarious cameo by Scorsese's own mother), instantly reminding us of Rupert's place in the world.  We don't know yet if Rupert is talented or not, in fact we won't know until a scene near the end, but his corner-cutting entitlement predated so many Hiltons, Kardashians and Trumps.  \n\nWhen we first meet Rupert, he's outside Langford's studio along with a throng of autograph hounds.  When Jerry enters his limo, a crazed fan jumps in after him.  That would be Masha (Bernhard).  Langford, adept at clocking a stalker when he sees one, immediately gets out and comes face to face with Rupert.  From inside the limo, the frame freezes on Masha's hands pressing against the window, aching to make contact with Jerry.  Ray Charles' \"Come Rain Or Come Shine\" plays on the soundtrack:  \"I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you/\nCome rain or come shine\" - so eery in this context.  It's such an indelible image of obsession and one in which I knew we were in for a masterful filmgoing experience.  \n\nSeizing the moment, Rupert parts the crowd, shepherds Jerry to safety and then climbs into the limo himself.  He uses him time just long enough to convince Jerry to listen to a tape of his material.  Never mind that he hasn't recorded it yet, Rupert takes Jerry's condescending brush-off and uses it as invitation to much more subversive actions.  \n\nScene after scene shows Rupert trying to infiltrate Jerry's offices, but he comes across the expert deflection of a knowing receptionist or Cathy Long (Shelley Hack in a cunning, astute performance), Jerry's Development Rep.  Masha also schemes to get a love letter to Jerry, but also gets the cold shoulder.  In one amazing sequence, Masha chases Jerry down the street, but gets turned away at his revolving office door.  Eventually, Rupert and Masha team up to kidnap Jerry, allowing Rupert to appear on his show and for Masha to have some personal time with her prey.  \n\nWhat works so well in this fairly straightforward, simple story is the tone.  It's meant to keep you in a constant state of queasiness.  Scorsese, with his cinematographer Fred Schuler, locks the camera down most of the time so that we're forced to sit still with our main characters...the better to make you squirm.  Things only get zippy when we're out in the New York streets.  Lewis himself directed one of those scenes in which we watch Jerry walk to work.  With calls out from construction workers and cab drivers, Jerry has a little spring in his step.  A woman at a phone booth stops him to praise him.  Jerry thanks her but demures when she asks him to talk to her nephew on the other end of the line.  Turning on him instantly, she yells, \"You should only get cancer! I hope you get cancer!\"  And that, in a nutshell, is the brilliance of this film.  The journey from top to bottom, and vice versa, can be very short.  \n\nAt one point, Rupert reunites with his high school crush Rita (Diahnne Abbott).  She sees him for what he is, but can't resist an offer to go to Jerry's with him for the weekend.  Unbeknownst to her, they weren't invited.  Jerry's dead-inside reaction to this home invasion speaks volumes.  In scene after scene, Lewis plays against type.  Gone is the wacky clown, replaced by years of knowledge of the exact toll celebrity can have on a person.  It's an astonishing, scary, unforgettable performance.  A prisoner of his own fame, Jerry can do nothing but be numb to the atrocities on display.  \n\nRupert is a delusional, entitled, lazy dreamer.  He was decades ahead of social media stars who made fortunes by posting a picture of their breakfasts.  DeNiro has never given a performance that's anything like this.  He's constantly gesticulating and unwilling to take no for an answer.  He's dangerous.  Who would have imagined that 35 years later, a Rupert would become the leader of the free world?  \n\nWhen we finally get to see Rupert's act, done in one incredible single take, it's mediocre at best.  Sometimes mediocrity is celebrated.  Oh what the hell am I saying?  This country has a history of putting mediocrity on a pedestal.  It explains Twenty One Pilots.  \n\nI look at THE KING OF COMEDY as TAXI DRIVER's funnier but just-as-ugly little brother.  Two delusional men find fame by committing crimes.  They both go after ideal but disinterested women.  One does it to save an innocent soul while the other is completely self-serving.  On second thought, which one is the darker film?\n\nThere's too much to unpack, but I want to point out some details that get me every time:\n\n-Rupert eyes the ceiling of Jerry's waiting room.  It makes the weary receptionist look up. He notices and then asks her, \"Is that cork?\"  Probably the best use of insipid small talk in a film since NASHVILLE.\n-Masha's entire head shaking wildly when she goes on one of her tirades\n-Rupert standing in front of a giant audience photo as he fantasizes about his big debut\n-The guy imitating Rupert behind his back, sending a signal to Rita that she's having dinner with a schmuck.\n-The never-ending mispronunciation of Rupert's last name (Pipkin, Pumpkin, Pupnik)\n-Members of The Clash in the scene where Masha yells at everyone, calling them \"street trash\"\n-Masha's reprise of \"Come Rain Or Come Shine\".  Funny how Bernhard's career after this film always included a little comedy and a little singing.\n-Masha casually tossing the wine glass away.\n-Masha clearing the candlelit table as everything comes crashing down.  They threw in cat noises just to make it even funnier.\n-Masha's one-sided conversation with Jerry, telling him, \"I want to be black\" and then doing an adorable yet frightening Tina Turner imitation.\n-Rupert asking Cathy, \"Are you speaking for Jerry?\"  Makes my skin crawl.\n-Editor Thelma Schoonmaker, a legend, smash cutting to the Jerry Langford show logo right after Masha strips down to her underwear and says that she and Jerry are gonna have \"Good old-fashioned, all-American fun!\"\n-Masha hauntingly blowing a kiss to Jerry.  She's crazy scary.  \n-Rita proves she's just as susceptible to the glow of fame when she steals a little box from Jerry's house.  She's supposed to be the saint of the story, yet even she can be bought.\n-The announcer cheerily chimes, \"Rupert Pupkin, everybody!  Rupert Pupkin!\"\n-The line:  \"Better to be king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime.\"  \n\nI kept thinking about NETWORK and A FACE IN THE CROWD when watching THE KING OF COMEDY this time.  How ahead of their time these films were, and what would a prescient film made today look like?  Would we be predicting the end of fame?  The end of mediocrity?  A return to hard work and talent?

It is a constructive script, has an excellent character construction, is a growing and extremely linear script, although it splits into scenes of Rupert's imagination with reality, this may confuse a bit because Scorsese does not change the picture or any aspect that shows Being an imagination, this is good because it privileges the viewer who is more inside the film. The moral of the film is to talk a bit more about the obsession of fame, we run the risk of arrest for a successful night, it also criticizes people who idolize artists by putting them on pedestals common people. We have a dark photograph, with that gray film, it even recalls a mafia movie - not Scorsese's - but we have a touch of humor and irony, we do not have that typical Scorsese rhythm, on the contrary, a good edition, but nothing surprising . Robert De Niro does a very cool acting, he is very fluent, and he does a very good acting but very funny, he is the only one, because the secondary characters are weak.

It's a look into the life of a celebrity stalker, and it paints an interesting picture of how someone like this might delude himself into believing his attention is desired by the person he idolizes. I loved how the obsession and delusion became more aggressive as time passed.\n\nThe fantasy/dream sequences were a superb idea. When the first one hit I didn't know if it was real or imagined, and this works perfectly in the plot. This added element makes it so each time we see another sequence we have to question whether it was really happening. In fact, I still don't know for sure if the epilogue was intended as an actual glimpse into the future or not. \n\nRobert De Niro is great as Rupert Pupkin. He plays him as a sympathetic character, so you feel sorry for him instead of being annoyed or disgusted by him. Sandra Bernhard is a good counterpoint to show what he could be if his obsession is taken to the extreme. But I think the best acting in The King of Comedy came from Jerry Lewis. He is everything you'd expect from a popular TV talk show host, and delivers some of the most subtle and funny jokes in the movie. \n\nThe humor was something I never expected. I don't know why but, despite the title, I thought Scorsese was taking this down a more serious path. But the film is darkly comedic throughout and I was chuckling a lot. Scorsese makes a few choices that I don't understand, but most of the time I think it's a very good movie. I was even impressed by the costuming because Rupert's suits looked exactly like someone trying to dress up as his favorite talk show host. Maybe not one of my favorite films of all time, but definitely a treat, and proof that Scorsese has more range than I thought.",

Predicting the obsessive nature of celebrity culture 'The King Of Comedy' is a dark comedic tale. One that's eerily real, one part hilarious the other disturbing.\n\nThree years after 'Raging Bull' 'Scorsese' took on the black comedy (and later again with 'After Hours). 'The King of Comedy' is a largely forgotten film in his bibliography. But may be one of the most important.  One that is only more relevant the years go by. 'Rupert Pupkin' (Robert De Niro) a huge fan of comedian and talk show host 'Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) and after a 'meeting' with him is convinced they are now best friends. It's not abundantly clear that 'Rupert' is a little off, his first encounter with 'Jerry' is that of an over-eager up and coming comedian. It's only when we see him back at his house talking to cardboard 'Jerry' and 'Liza Minnelli' that it's clear.\n\nEven then there's something remarkably like-able about 'Rupert' even in the third act when some realisation hits home (well in a way). Eventually it becomes particularly clear that this man is obsessed with his hero 'Jerry Lewis' as his 'friend' 'Marsh' (Sandra Bernhard). Living in his own world their are some fantastically 'real' yet 'fake' scenes where we get to see inside the man's head. Going all out in his own head on how it would or will play out when 'Jerry' realises his talent. Initially trying to tell himself how humble he would be but quickly descends into self-indulgence. It's funny yet tragically sad - I was always pulling for him despite his ridiculous beliefs. \n\nIt consistently delivers the same tone throughout with neither the dark or comedic aspect fully taking over. Particularly with Pupkin's final and ultimately effective attempt at getting on his idols show in the form of a 10 minutes slot. Despite it being a stand-up routine it slowly descends into 'Pupkins' view on his  bad upbringing. Is any of it true? who knows. \n\n\"Better to be a king for a night than a schmuck for a lifetime\". He reaches his goal and is willing to live with the consequences. And there's some parity with Taxi Driver' - whether or not the 'end' (or as his act starts on TV) is real or a day-dream. I'm more incline (for both films) with the dream, an idealisation of what happens. The books, the early release and his own show. Living forever in his delusion, at least he's happy though.\n\n'The King of Comedy' is part of the forgotten films of 'Scorsese' but isn't any less brilliant. A deft look at celebrity culture and the (sometimes) negative impact it can have on peoples view of their idols. And of all the films he's made this one has the most relevancy. This is something waiting to happen although it won't be as endearing or as funny.",

The title \"The King of Comedy\" had me thinking the Scorsese film would be a biopic of some talk show host I had never heard of. Instead, the film is an off-beat character study which kept making me feel embarrassed for Robert De Niro's character, Rupert Pupkin, but in a good way.\n\nI'm sure we all have fantasies of meeting our one true hero, and we imagine a conversation with him/her will go really well. Rupert Pupkin has this fantasy about his hero, Jerry Langford, a famous comedian played by Jerry Lewis, but this fantasy takes a quick turn to more of an expectation for Pupkin. After one encounter with Langford, Pupkin, who still lives with his mother while he is in his 30s I believe, constantly harasses the people who work for Langford because he believes Langford has become his friend and has agreed to let Pupkin appear on the show, which couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nDuring the course of the movie I found myself feeling embarrassed/awkward for Pupkin since he does so many things which made me internally say \"come on, man, don't do THAT.\" In this sense the film reminded me of feelings I constantly have when I watch \"The Office;\" well, at least feelings I have when Steve Carell plays Michael Scott and makes things super awkward for the people around him. De Niro's performance as Pupkin was so on-the-spot for this quirky and awkward character, proving he has a great range in his acting ability since he often plays \"tough guys\" like Jake La Motta, Al Capone, and the younger Vito Corleone in \"The Godfather Part II.\"\n\nI feel that one mentally ill character was enough for this film, though in hindsight I guess De Niro's counterpart lady friend was essential to the film. There are scenes with her towards the end of the film, however, that make her appear to be abnormal \"just because,\" whereas De Niro's character is abnormal out of a strong passion for his image as a comedian and out of a need of approval from Jerry Langford and his love interest, Rita.\n\nCertainly not one of Scorsese's best films, but then again Scorsese has so many movies that I don't believe I've even seen a third of his filmography yet. I'd still recommend this film because it is a nice change of pace from the typical dark drama which Scorsese often directs.",

This is an film that triggers frustration and irritation and have characters that you may not like or aprove of. DeNiros character Rupert pupkin reminds me of Jake Gyllenhaals character from Nightcrawler, psychopathic, excentic and egoistic. He is a 30-something year old nerd who lives in his mothers basement with cutboards of Jerry Langford that he talks to. All the dream sequenses are well done and innovative because the most of them is filmed with a TV-camera which gives it a different effect than from other dream sequenses. It is written with irony within showbusiness and fanboyism and straight up obsession over fame and famous people. All because of the TV. Extremely well directed and acted, perfectly written and very realistic. It is not a comedy and more of a drama and psychological film filled with dark and tragically true reality.",

            "content": "This movie came straight outta left field really, after two mean thrillers and hard hitting biographical, a black comedy felt like an odd turn. Scorsese was still kinda finding his feet at this point, almost at a fork in his career in what to do, his following two movies after this ('After Hours' and 'The Colour of Money') confirms this. From very raw emotional adult films, then branching out into a comedy, even with De Niro, seemed brave. Scorsese could of easily slipped into the mainstream realms at this time. 'After Hours' was another quirky black comedy, but the type of comedy that you could easily see Tom Hanks leading, whilst 'The Colour of Money' was most definitely a mainstream movie with the man of the moment Tom Cruise.\n\nLuckily this didn't happen and we have a string of adult targeted movies to enjoy...mainly mobster movies. Nevertheless looking back its cool to see these more unique Scorsese projects, how he handled them and how or if his now infamous trademarks and style are still visible. First up, its a Scorsese movie, De Niro? check, New York setting? check, plot about a wacko loner? check...annnnd we're done.\n\nThe film feels like an extension of Scorsese's 1976 film 'Taxi Driver' to be honest, naturally this is down to the simple fact that De Niro plays another lonely weirdo who inadvertently becomes a hero of sorts by the end. You could almost call this a remake really, just a more light-hearted version. We follow the celebrity worshipping Rupert Pupkin (great name) as he tries his utmost to get on Jerry Langford's (Jerry Lewis) talk show with his stand-up act. This takes up pretty much the entire film until an encounter with Langford at his home shows Pupkin he has no chance of getting on the show. The ever resourceful Rupert doesn't let this fade him though as he hatches a plan to kidnap Langford in order to demand his act be shown on the talk show. At the same time Pupkin has the help of another fellow celebrity worshipper/stalker in Masha (Sandra Bernhard).\n\nI can't help but think De Niro is gonna explode in a tidal wave of blood soaked violence when I watch this movie. Its probably down to his previous performances and roles (and the era when this was made), but its like you're just waiting for his character to pop and kick someones head in. Its really quite unnerving at times, that's how good De Niro is, the man is a twitching time bomb ready to blow. I love watching De Niro in this movie, its almost hypnotising with his little quirks, his little nuances, everything we now know about the man but ramped up to ten. \n\nI could probably go on record saying this is one of De Niro's best performances. Not only is he uncomfortable to watch with his sleazy used car salesman-esque appearance complete with a little annoying tash, but he's both funny and kinda lovable at the same time. His character is always very polite and well mannered to everyone he meets, he's smart, gracious, keen and accepting of criticism to a degree. I adore how he oozes around the top brass in the networks main building in NY, still very polite and pleasant but also such a slippery, slimy, creep, trying his best to talk his way into a meeting with the mighty Langford. Its amusing because you know this guy probably doesn't really have much talent but he clearly thinks he does. He's clearly overly ambitious and overly confident in himself which is funny but at the same time not exactly a bad thing, that's why you kinda love the guy for persevering, he's got balls but no sense of tact.\n\nThe little moments where we see Pupkin pretending to be on the show with Langford, in conversation with him either professionally or in private and setting up his own overblown introductions for the show etc...are priceless. The funniest thing is he's doing this at his home with his mother in the next room type of thing, a typical middle aged man still living at home with him mum scenario. These brief scenes also show us how crazy Pupkin is, his room (or basement) is decorated like a real talk show studio with a big picture of an audience on one wall, mock-ups of Langford he can talk to etc...This shows us his potential scary side and makes you wonder if he will go hyper nuts at some point.\n\nThe other cast members are all very good in their roles too. Jerry Lewis really nails that old fashioned 70's (I'm guessing) talk show host look with the big rimmed glasses, dapper suits, slick hair and smoking whilst on the air. He really does look like one of your old relations in a family photo from back in the late 70's early 80's perhaps. Not only that but you really feel his frustration and anger as he puts up with the constant unwanted attention and pestering from fans and nutjobs. The scene where he confronts Pupkin at his private home is probably his strongest. I was also really impressed with Bernhard who gives us an excellently crazy yet sexy stalker. I don't much about Bernhard outside of the TV show 'Roseanne' and her role in the Bruce Willis turd 'Hudson Hawk', but towards the end of this film she really gives it her all. The sequence with her character having a romantic dinner with the kidnapped Langford (duct taped to a chair) is amusing, sexy and obviously disturbing. All three being perfect traits of Bernhard.\n\nOf course the twist in the film is that Pupkin's stand-up routine is successful, he doesn't end up killing anyone or himself in a blaze of glory and he actually manages to achieve what he always wanted. On one hand that might seem anti-climatic but on the other hand the more predictable ending of him getting killed along with his idol would be errmm...predictable. For me this ending is just right, it could of easily been a subdued finale but I think Pupkin was too likable, as was Masha, neither of them really do anything unlikable throughout. In the end I was really happy Pupkin manages to succeed with his dream, sure he's a bit twisted and unhinged in a strangely calm way (he did kidnap someone after all), but he's still a really nice guy at the end of the day.\n\nI like this film very much, I think its a cute yet slightly off-kilter story which shows both a gutsy win for the little guy and the heartache a famous personality may have to deal with. But at no point is it ever deadly serious to the point of being a thriller, the crime committed is serious but its all done in a very tame almost apologetic way. Its a breath of fresh air to see an early performance by De Niro where he isn't a psychopath for the mob or just out of his mind. This movie was a bomb on release and has been largely forgotten about ever since, but I wholeheartedly recommend it.",

The King of Comedy is an engaging picture that boasts memorable performances, a great story, and brilliant direction to really make the film standout. I really enjoyed the movie, and felt it was another standout feature from Martin Scorsese, who is one of cinema's finest directors. With this film, being a slight change of pace, as Scorsese would be more at ease with the crime, and gangster genres, it's great to see him movie in the comedy genre, and he is able to pull it off because he is a phenomenal filmmaker and storyteller. The way Scorsese crafts a film is unmatched by any other director, he is able to get the simplest ideas and make them into a terrific, well layered picture that delivers some truly engaging entertainment. Scorsese is one of my favorite directors, and I've seen a lot of his movies, The King of Comedy would rank among his best films, a film that is funny, dramatic, thrilling from start to finish and is sure to appeal to fans of the director. With that being said, Whenever Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese would make cinematic gold. If you enjoy Martin Scorsese's work, then you're surely going to love this film.

It is\ndone well and mixes drama and comedy to make a film that is hugely\nenjoyable but also has a very unpredictable plot which shows us how\nmuch people can go to get near there celebrity idols. In the end I felt\nthis film was safely very good, and here below is why so.\n\nThe story is well timed and for the length that it is, it plays out\nvery well as a plot. In the end you come out thinking \"was that a\ncomedy, or a drama\" well in a sense it is both but because it contains\nso much of both, you may be think it just one of the genres. It takes\nmaybe a little while to truly get stuck into the plot but it is worth\nit by the end as the ending is very unpredictable and will leave you\nwith a sense of what is going on here.\n\nRobert De Niro in the main role as Rupert Pupkin is very good and shows\nall his class that we don't always see in a comedy role, this is\nperhaps his most diverse performance ever in film. Jerry Lewis as the\nchat show host is calm and comfortable in the role and to say he is a\ncomedian in real life, he lets others take the funny bits as if to say\nJerry isn't allowed to be the funny on there, he has to take it by\nothers. The rest of the cast do well but no one stands out as much as\nDe Niro really and no wonder Scorsese and him work together so well.\n\nNow on to Martin Scorsese he directs this well and really brings the\nscript alive with his commanding role that in my opinion, is the reason\nDe Niro is such a good actor here. He seemed to bring the best out of\neveryone but also with the solid script he had to work with, it is no\nwonder it works so well to listen to and to watch. It has some good\nbits of humour, not chocked full but could pleasantly entertain some\nfans of Drama comedies.\n\nThere isn't much wrong with this film but what I will say is that it\ncould lack enough humour to be funny, and that maybe the story isn't\nthe smartest Scorsese has ever done, maybe the most fun but not smarter\nthan most he does. I think the comedy also changes too much and bits\nare funny then it goes away for long spells only to randomly come back\nwith it's more humorous ramblings, funny bits are funny though. \n\nAny Scorsese fan should love this, as I say maybe won't have you struck\nby the power of it, but will still thoroughly entertain you and you\nknow it is by him it done so well. Most people should enjoy this as it\ncontains all the elements a comedy drama must have and some very if not\nweirdly likable characters in it. Some may dislike this as it can be\nvery quiet at times and slow compared to the beginning pace, but most\nshould have positive thoughts after watching this.\n\nOverall I give this a low 8/10, it is a Safely Good Movie, not near to being\nGreat in my opinion like so many others think, but I still felt it was\nvery good like I say and that makes it very very fun. With this you\nhave to marvel at the acting skills involved and may even serve as a\ncult film to some as we really get to explore the mind of Pupkin and\nwhy is he so obsessed with Stand up on the Jerry Langford show, and\nJerry Langford himself.",

At the end I have to say that it was a good movie with solid performances (even from Jerry Lewis) and very secure directing by Martin Scorsese. I really liked the subject of the movie - the celebrity worshiping and the American media culture, and what they create!\r\n\r\nI had a chance to follow a real psychopath Rupert Pupkin (De Niro), a stage-door autograph hound, who happens to be an aspiring stand-up comedian whose ambition far exceeds his talent. After meeting Jerry Langford (Lewis), a successful comedian and talk show host, Rupert believes his \"big break\" has finally come. He attempts to get a place on the show but is continually rebuffed by Langford's staff and, finally, by Langford himself. Well, along the way, Rupert indulges in elaborate and obsessive fantasies where he and Langford are colleagues and friends... and failing to differentiate between his fantasies and reality, he even takes a date, Rita, to Langford's home...\r\n\r\nAfter Raging Bull was completed, Scorsese was keen to do a pet project of his, The Last Temptation of Christ, and wanted De Niro to play Jesus Christ. De Niro was not interested and preferred their next collaboration to be a comedy. \r\n\r\nScorsese's first choice for talk show host Jerry Langford was Johnny Carson. Carson refused the role, and the entire Rat Pack was also considered-specifically Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin-before a decision was made to select Martin's old partner, Jerry Lewis! \r\n\r\nI will repeat, it was a good movie but for me was neither funny enough to be a black comedy nor scary enough to capitalise on its thriller elements... the best part was the satirical one.",

It is a wonderful and unsettling film with a great performance from Robert De Niro. I feel sorry for younger audiences who have only seen his recent work, because they are missing out on one of the best actors during the 80's and 90's. Here, De Niro plays a mentally unstable  character who is obsessed with becoming famous. I don't know if our culture was so obsessed with celebrity and fame during the 80's as they are now, but The King of Comedy is very much prescient today and that is one of the reasons why it still speaks to its audience more than 30 years after its release. It isn't an easy watch, especially if you are expecting a Scorsese film like Goodfellas, but it is equally effective. The King of Comedy plays out as an edgy cultural satire and despite feeling unsettled by some of the characters motivations I still was engaged with the story. This is a unique dark comedy because it is much more restrained than others, and it isn't a comedy that will have you laughing throughout the movie, but it works in a creepy and unsettling way thanks to Scorsese's direction and De Niro's inspired performance.\n\nThis satire of our celebrity obsessed society was written by Paul D. Zimmerman and it stars Robert De Niro as an aspiring comedian who is obsessed with becoming famous. We first see Rupert Pupkin hanging around a crowd of fans outside a local TV studio where Jerry Langford's (Jerry Lewis) comedy show is taped. Jerry is greeted by his fans as he exits the show and heads for his limo, but an obsessed stalker named Masha (Sandra Bernhard) awaits for him hidden in his car. In the midst of all the turmoil, Rupert separates Jerry from Masha and the rest of the crowd. He then seizes his opportunity and ends up alone with Jerry in his limo distancing himself from the rest of the crowd who in his opinion are simply autograph hounds. Rupert then introduces himself and tells Jerry that he is an aspiring comedian and wants him to invite him to his show because he believes he has potential. In order to get rid of him Jerry politely gives him some advice and tells Rupert to send a tape of his jokes to his assistant, Cathy Long (Shelley Hack), but he recommends he start at the bottom and begin performing in small local shows. Rupert is so fixated with himself and his desire to become famous that he has a difficult time trying to separate what is real and what is fantasy. Back home he begins fantasizing about his conversation with Jerry, and now that he has gotten this far he won't stop until he gets his shot at fame.\n\nRupert isn't an easy character to root for considering he only cares about himself and can't take no for an answer. His presence unsettles everyone around him just like it does with us as we watch him invite himself to Jerry's country home or as he insists on meeting with him in his studio. Scorsese does a great job with this film creating this unsettling and disturbing atmosphere. Jerry Lewis gives a much more restrained performance and it is very different from the quirky roles we've seen him play before. In a way he's just playing himself and that is why he is so believable in his Johnny Carson like role. Sandra Bernhard's performance divided critics as some considered it to be over the top, but I thought she was great considering this is a satire of our culture's obsession with celebrities and fame. I thought the ending of this film was also perfect and very poignant. There are two ways you can read into the ending (since Rupert fantasizes so much it is hard to separate that from reality) but if it really played out the way it's presented at the end I thought it was a powerful critique of how we as a culture value success and fame over morality.

The King of Comedy is not an easy film to watch mostly due to the annoyingly persistent nature of Rupert Pupkin and because of how he treats people but strangely I wanted to keep watching because of Pupkin, I really quite liked him, in a very odd way. Probably because I've never really seen a character like this. It's a very painful and annoying film to watch but for the right reasons.

And even, give or take a few pounds, Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) -- a zealous talk show host in the hangdog vein of a leather-skinned Johnny Carson ripoff -- could pragmatically come off as the very same stand-up lounge lizard for whom we left Jake LaMotta at the end of \"Raging Bull\".\n\nBut Scorsese, now 71 years old in 2013, has fashioned a rich career out of never settling, always trying to one-up himself. \"The King of Comedy\" is a blistering, fairly depressing look at the near-impossibility of making it in show business, yet the film comes off as effortlessly edgy, hilarious and subtle, when ultimately its message is something bleak and disheartening. \"King\" is the work of a filmmaker with genuine passion for what he's skewering, and it's one of the greatest Hollywood satires ever made while the story itself is set in NYC. It just goes to show how well Scorsese and the late screenwriter Paul D. Zimmerman understand the worrisome silver lining to America's all-consuming intoxication with celebrity and media culture: better to be king for a night, than a schmuck for a lifetime. (100/100)",

This movie just brings you back to the times when De Niro starred in great movies and totally placing himself in the position of the character he's playing and making sure we realize that he is not just playing himself each movie. This movie he gets absolutely scary. It has a comedic undertone and sort of a sympathetic one, even if this guy is absolutely insane and doesn't even know it. With this exceptional performance, he makes the movie totally unnerving.\r\n\r\nOur main character, Rupert Pupkin, happens to meet Jerry Langford, who's a popular talk show host who feels losing a bit, on the way out after the show. They share a limo together and Pupkin soon thinks he and Jerry are friends and he continually tries to get himself on his show through all sorts of ways.\r\n\r\nThis movie has plenty of funny gags and all, but it's all about the character of Rupert Pupkin. Without him and Jerry Lewis, the movie would completely fall apart. The funniest part has to be when Pupkin gets confronted by the police, because he actually thinks he won't go will jail and he will do his stand-up routine if he tells them where he captured Jerry Lewis. Awkwardly, Scorsese makes this the one of the most unnerving parts. He's such a sympathetic character for being such a psychopath and Scorsese does this all funny scenes in the movie. It's done so brilliantly that I can't put it into words. The final part of the movie almost had me looking away from my computer screen. It was so hard to watch in the best way possible. \r\n\r\nI haven't talked about a lot of the casting yet. There's only three main characters, those being Pupkin, Rangford and an obsessed woman who wants to love Rangford. Scorsese has almost always casted every guy character in his movie correctly. I've always thought he's had a problem selecting his female leads. While Cybill Shepherd was great in Taxi Driver, Cameron Diaz was horrible in Gangs of New York along such lines as Leo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis. The main female lead here didn't have a lot here except some satire of celebrity obsessed people. Jerry Lewis plays his role really good here. His facial expressions are amazingly funny and what he has to put up with this movie just makes his down to Earth portrayal just that much better.\r\n\r\nThis is without a doubt one of the most underrated gems of all time and I am very reluctant to give it a 10/10.",

            "content": "As with After Hours and The Last Temptation of Christ, King of Comedy is one that tends to be forgotten amidst Scorsese's more widely known and oft-hailed classics such as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas etc. It's a shame that this savage satire on celebrity culture is so overlooked, as it is arguably one of his best, and undoubtedly one of his funniest movies. Likewise, it's probably DeNiro's most underrated performance. He is truly remarkable as the deranged would-be comedian extraordinaire Rupert Pupkin. \r\n\r\nThe story centers around Rupert Pupkin(Robert DeNiro), a slightly troubled(to put it mildly), fame-hungry man who fancies himself the next big player in the world of stand-up comedy. In his desperation to fulfill this dream Rupert decides to kidnap his ''friend'' and idol Jerry Langford(Jerry Lewis), in the hope of ensuring a spot on television to finally perform his stand-up in front of a live audience and convincing the world at large of his self-proclaimed talents.  \r\n\r\nOne of the things that struck me while watching the movie was the close similarity with Scorsese's less comedic yet equally unnerving Taxi Driver. Like Travis Bickle, the iconic hero of that movie, Rupert is a deeply troubled character, at once deluded and narcissistic. De Niro channels Bickle in Pupkins obsessive nature, confrontational attitude and eerie charm. Both movies explore existential themes of alienation, loneliness and obsession. Despite his outward, pompous charisma Rupert is a lonely man who spends most of his time in his own manic head, conversing with life-sized cardboard cut-outs of the celebrities he so desperately wishes to be his peers. Unlike with poor Travis Bickle, Scorsese was kind enough to give Rupert a solitary companion, the equally bonkers and fame-obsessed Masha(a brilliantly demented performance by Sandra Bernhard). Pupkins is a more amiable and goofier character than Bickle, but in all honesty he is no less menacing. From the very first scene you can sense a dangerous person bubbling beneath his chummy exterior. To harp on about the similarities with Taxi Driver, there is also that strange ambiguity, particularly at the ending, where the apparent reality of the movie seems to have meshed with our hero's obsessive fantasies.\r\n\r\nArguably the movies greatest scene is where Pupkins finally gets the opportunity to perform his stand-up in front of a live audience. Wisely, it seems the writers elected that Pupkins comedic material should not completely stink. It's just mediocre, miserably mediocre; just good enough for someone like Pupkins to believe it's truly exceptional.  \r\nIt's a strangely unsettling scene- watching someone as emotionally damaged as Pupkins recite wacky jokes about his difficult childhood. Scorsese seems to recognize something sad and wounded in the art of stand-up comedy. I was reminded of the scene in the final act of Raging Bull, where Jake La Motta performs a dire piece of comedy at his club, and how the strained laughter of his audience seemed to sum up the characters piteous downfall. Here, again, the stand-up scene is more depressing than humorous; Ironically it  may be the least funny scene in the movie. One might feel uneasy laughing at such misery and degradation, if certain scenes weren't so absurd and at times clearly played for laughs. One particular scene springs to mind, where our hero attempts to force his way through Langford's TV studio. The situation is painfully awkward, yet somehow transforms into a slapstick cat-and-mouse chase scene. Misery and comedy are never too far apart in this movie.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, this is quite a dark movie, much darker than I expected it to be. It's also quite cringeworthy and sad but undoubtedly very funny. Rupert might be a lame comedian, but he makes for an immensely funny character. There's much more to discuss about this movie so I may have to edit this review in time. Like the best work of Scorsese and De Niro, it is a dense and subtle piece that demands a re-watch. But for now, I am happy to declare that this is a marvellous, funny and thought-provoking movie. An underrated gem. 10/10.",

Jerry Lewis and Sandra Bernhard highlight an inspired cast headlined by Robert De Niro in top form.

Director Martin Scorsese underscores this with his film The King of Comedy (1983) about a struggling, unemployed comedian in the making (Robert De Niro) in which comedy seems to be his only interest; chiefly the popular comedian Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) who is a rather sad man. De Niro's character Rupert Pupkin attempts to set up numerous meeting with Langford, only to be spurned each time by his breezy secretary, leading him to resort to more and more drastic measures. Pupkin is a very unusual type of antihero, one who has absolute confidence in himself and whatever he does and is persistent in his efforts to achieve fame. He is his own unique kind of psychopath. While not grounded plot-wise, the film instead takes the anything could happen approach, where Pupkin is as clueless as the audience is about what his next move will be, but when he does act, it is not upon logic or reasoning but emotion. It was not very popular upon release, receiving limited theater coverage and mixed reviews, but became more recognized among critics later on as another great pairing between its star and director.",

The King of Comedy is in a way a black comedy, and in a subtle way a little horror film; it is a rumination on the dangers of celebrity culture, celebrities, and the sensibility in our country to allow anyone to become famous for the entirely wrong reasons. Rupert Pupkin is a fellow who fashions himself quite the comedian. And boy does he idolize Jerry Langley. He thinks his idol will help him make the big time as easily as possible. Only Langley (played by an alarmingly sour Jerry Lewis) is a jaded man who detests being as famous as he is. And Pupkin is completely insane. The film grows in a quiet crescendo. It is only very slowly that you realize how demented Pupkin (played as eerily earnest as possible by Robert De Niro) is. He starts off as a somewhat obnoxious guy who can't take a hint. He becomes a stalker. You see that each day for him is a delusion in which he lives as more famous than Langley himself. And when Pupkin performed his comedy routine to a black and white cardboard crowd, who in his mind adore him, well, it's clear just how deranged he is. And yet he never has that big crazy moment. He is consistent throughout: collected, pleasant, earnest, assured of his own success. Despite seeing the hell that is Jerry's life, and being the partial cause of it, he wants nothing more than to be famous, at any cost. (Stop reading if weary of spoilers; analyzing end is essential to criticizing film). \nAnd the clincher is: Rupert Pupkin wins. He goes to monstrous lengths to get what he wants, and wins. He becomes more famous than anyone but himself would have dreamt. He is the Spencer and Heidi. He is the Octomom. He is TMZ. He is OJ writing the 'If I did it' book. He is everything wrong with American celebrity, and he becomes a veritable folk hero. This film was more on the nose than Scorsese would dare to believe, like the Truman Show. It is a quiet, simple story of obsession and glory, that, if you can deal with its slow pace, is a true masterpiece.",

Zimmerman instrument an ambiguous comeuppance thanks to the film's shrewd amalgam of reality and hallucination.\n\nAs a pungent satire to the instant showbiz fame and the celebrity's overwrought mental condition with the autograph hounds and devout stalkers, the film is an eloquent body of work in manipulating its viewer's empathetic oscillation between Pupkin and Langford, for instance, on the one hand, I feel repellent towards Jerry's hubris and snootiness (his deadly oomph towards women is something I could never understand, what a great job for Bernhard to deliver the madness in front of such a distasteful sine qua non), on the other hand, when put myself in his shoes, the nettlesome Pupkin is a parasite-like cipher one instinctively despises. The same could be transposed with Pupkin, one moment you regard him as a deadbeat chatterbox by badgering Jerry, next scene you feel sorry for him because we know Jerry will shatter his dreams sooner or later, and when that dramatic moment eventually happens, the interplay among Pupkin, Jerry and Rita (Pupkin's love interest played by De Niro's then-wife Abbott) is spontaneous, awkwardly cringing and impeccably acted.\n\nDe Niro has unwaveringly forsaken his acting skill since his glorious years (70s to 80s), a committed incarnation of a stand-up comedian in his hard-earned live stint, but an overall, his comedian bent may be not as hyped as he claims, at least, not ground-breaking enough to be at a king's level, thus making the ending resound with a more cynically suspicious irony. De Niro's methodological strenuousness seems to be markedly discordant with Lewis' more naturalistic instinct-driven skill, which actually is an opportune win-win situation both for the comic vein and for the actors, they are ranking high in my respective categories. Also Bernhard is spectacular in her nut's sickly possessiveness despite of her less-limned backstory, maybe she is a much qualified comedian than her pal. \n\nAn unfeigned delight to watch this film and to revere more towards Mr. Scorsese, whose all-purpose greatness is an unerring beacon to guide his disciples and an insatiable lure to his ceaseless fan club recruits.",

De Niro often has these fantasies of performing live comedy with his \"mentor\" Jerry in front of audiences when it is all a figment of his imagination. De Niro however is a psychopath but strange enough a likeable one. One whom the audience can sympathize with and one we can understand. Pupkin saves Jerry from a mob of people but after various attempts to get his attention he decides to kidnap him this way he can finally get his chance to be \"king for the night.\" \n\nThe film is structured perfectly and Scorsese not for a minute leaves you bored. This film is a great accomplishment for himself and for Mr. De Niro who as always gives a powerhouse performance like no one else can. The film despite being very dramatic, and serious with its story is also very funny. De Niro's jokes, mannerisms, and actions are spot on I swear you would think you were watching a real comedian.

The movie follows Rupert Pupkin, a sociopathic man who balances his time between developing his comedy routine and stalking his idol, a talk-show host named Jerry Langford (played by Jerry Lewis) who greatly values his privacy. After he is able to have a brief conversation with Langford, Pupkin begins to obsessively pursue him in order to perform stand-up on his show, and Pupkin eventually resorts to drastic measures to achieve this goal. The movie is very uncomfortable very frequently because Pupkin repeatedly puts himself into painfully embarrassing situations, and De Niro plays him so well that it's hard not to cringe at the social ineptitude of his character. The movie is a black comedy, but it definitely has an eerie feel to it, partly because Pupkin is a complete sociopath and partly because the message of the movie is even more relevant now than it was thirty years ago. The King of Comedy is one of Scorsese's more overlooked movies but it's definitely one of his better ones, and it's just as likely to make you laugh as it is to make you squirm in your seat.",

For those of you that liked The Cable Guy, you'll like this movie. If you didn't, I think you'll still like it. It's very similar: Robert De Niro plays an aspiring stand up comedian and obsessive fan named Rupert Pupkin. He's obsessed with a talk show host named Jerry Langford, who is played by Jerry Lewis. I don't want to waste a whole lot of time on story for those that haven't seen it, but you can kind of guess where it could go from there.\n\nRobert De Niro is great as Rupert Pupkin. Scorsese says that De Niro's best performance under his direction is as Rupert, and I can definitely see it. I love the idiot savant characteristics that De Niro plays; he's practically autistic. You laugh at his obsessiveness, but are creeped out by it at the same time. Jerry Lewis also deserves a lot of praise. I haven't really seen his comedy, but he did a very good job getting into this character. I did not like Sandra Bernhard. She was constantly yelling, and I guess it fit her character, but she went over the top too much and seemed as if she was playing two emotions: angry and seductive. Mainly, it's angry, and it's annoying. Diahnne Abbott, who plays Pupkin's \"girlfriend\" and was De Niro's wife in real life at the time, is not without mentioning. She didn't blow me away, but she did do a good job.\n\nThere's a lot of good things to say about this movie. This is one of the few films (and I can't think of any others at the moment) where I felt the dream sequences are appropriate. They really allow you to go into the mind of Rupert Pupkin, and they're very enjoyable to watch. I also love Scorsese's direction. He doesn't give a damn about continuity. There's a conversation between De Niro and Bernhard on the street. In one shot, they're walking. In another, they've stopped. I'm one for continuity, but in this scene and in many others, you're usually so absorbed in the performances and the scene that you don't care. I also love what he does in the sequence where De Niro and Abbott go out on a date, with the guy in the background imitating Pupkin. That was absolutely hilarious, and one of the funniest parts in the movie. Again, don't want to give away what happens, but you'll know what I'm talking about. Another little moment I loved was when Pupkin was going in an office, and he tries to open the door inward, but realizes he can only pull it outwards. It's a little moment, but we've all been there and it's great to see it in a movie. I also love the moment where the cops are chasing Pupkin back and forth and Scorsese just holds it on a long shot.\n\nThere are things that I didn't like about it. I definitely thought the first half of the movie was much stronger. Not that the second half wasn't good, but in my opinion it became much more of a plot, and I feel that kind of hurt it for me. Again, I did not like Bernhard's acting at all.\n\nAs for the end, I believe it was real and not a dream sequence. It was a bit of a stretch for me that a guy could still be famous after 2 years in prison, but I could buy it as being real. The media usually sensationalizes people who are infamous, so for Rupert Pupkin to be made a sensation like that doesn't surprise me. It kind of reminded me of Network in that way, albeit Network is more about that, and The King of Comedy not as much. For example, we remember the names of the Columbine kids but not the name of someone who spent their entire life fighting cancer. \n\nOverall, I really liked the movie and it is a Scorsese film that deserves to be watched and recognized.",

Lewis gets the same treatment from HIS staff that Rupert gets trying to audition for a spot on the late night show ( it mimicks The Tonight Show btw).\n\n[img]http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTWHbtxoxFUvoAoLMB-37LmIS10ri8a9Zu_wszNLuV6AXpJ7zqvPQ[/img]\n\nThis film starts off so truely funny and until the kidnapping of Jerry Langdon (Jerry Lewis) it was funny.  Then it took a ugly turn to being a crime drama.  Most unpleasant was to see Jerry Lewis smack a near naked woman (his captor along with Rupert).  THAT need not have happened.\n\nI actually lost total respect for Jerry Lewis, the exalted comedian in this film.  Sure, its a movie, but Lewis seemed not acting at all as he grew increasingly hostile and unsympathetic to his kidnappers.\n\n[img]http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTegJVsgHOM5zAwdJK6ld4dKbRjCAxV963Bf8RXrTpTHkEJvlXs[/img]\n\n\n\nAt some point Lewis actually seems to want to feel something toward the struggling comics like Rupert (DeNiro), but instead he only becomes human at the point of a gun.\n\nEssentially for me this film was another Travis Bickle character, a deranged comic that behaves similarly as Woody Allen!   At one point in the film I actually thought Scorsese was trying to mimic a Woody Allen film!  The problem though is Martin Scorcese can no more make a comedy than Woody can make a serious drama.\n\n[img]http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTTeZ8jWrqtV8iOM4q-vq4_WQ_pahr2JJp1YZ_GHbbIakSWmoHF[/img]\n\nSee the film if you have not already.  It's great but it can make you uncomfortable and uneasy especially when Rupert doesn't take no for an answer and acts out his dillusional fantasies.\n\n\n\n\n\nREVIEWS:\n\n80% \nCertainly an interesting and thought-provoking one here. Very much the kind of performance that I like to see from DeNiro and Bernhard and Lewis didn'...\n\n70% \nAlthough it is scarce of any feeling and ultimately unrewarding, to watch it unfold is interesting and sometimes funny.\n\n\n\n---Roger Ebert says: \"Martin Scorsese's \"The King of Comedy\" is one of the most arid, painful, wounded movies I've ever seen. It's hard to believe Scorsese made it ... It is frustrating to watch, unpleasant to remember, and, in its own way, quite effective.\"\n\n--- Although the film was well received by critics, it bombed at the box office. De Niro said that the film \"...maybe wasn't so well received because it gave off an aura of something that people didn't want to look at or know.\"\n\n[img]http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRt3gKaSQD3faVjPSejQAByfH_NfBnVAmLYMak-y0VEEHPtCD4spA[/img]\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n\n1  Scorsese said he felt Lewis' performance in the film was vastly underrated and deserved more acclaim.\n\n2   He (Lewis) suggested an ending in which Rupert Pupkin kills Jerry, but was turned down. As a result, Lewis thought that the film, while good, did not have a \"finish.\"\n\n3   Scorsese's first choice for talk show host Jerry Langford was Johnny Carson.  The entire Rat Pack was also considered - specifically Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin - before a decision was made to select Martin's old partner, Jerry Lewis.\n\nScorsese has called De Niro's role as Rupert Pupkin his favorite of all their collaborations.\n\n4   The King of Comedy was the first film to open the 1983 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n5   Scorsese suggests that Rupert Pupkin's character fails to differentiate between his fantasies and reality. Scorsese sought to achieve the same with the film so that, in his words, the \"fantasy is more real than reality.\"\n\n\n[img]http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTy-P-jHOwC3AslVKEG29JNQF0AHqrTV8bCNUeQM9XwPKzsc3s3xA[/img]\n\n\n\nCritic's lists\n\n-Halliwells Top 1000 #180\n-1001 Movies You Must See Before you Die\n-Jonathan Rosenbaum: 1000 Essential Films\n-The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made--Total Film Presents The 100 Greatest Movies Of All Time #85\n-Empire's list of 500 greatest films (no. 87)\n\n\nCast\n\nRobert De Niro as Rupert Pupkin\nJerry Lewis as Jerry Langford\nDiahnne Abbott as Rita Keane\nSandra Bernhard as Masha\nShelley Hack as Cathy Long\nEd Herlihy as himself\n\n[img]http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRH7es9NOGr4jueemItV6xuwZPOJ_IIQc-0xmt2LeLrbskE361D[/img]\n\nDirected by Martin Scorsese \nProduced by Arnon Milchan \nWritten by Paul D.

I feel that it paid off and the result is an intriguing and line-blurring black comedy that shows the desperation in human nature from various angles, be it the psychopathic and somewhat terrifying Pupkin, the even more terrifying Marsha or the general public in the film who welcome Pupkin's insanity with open arms. What makes it more chilling is how convincing it's ending premise is- just look at Issei Sagawa for example- a cannibalistic murderer who went on to become a TV personality and even a food critic (apparently having a taste for human flesh means you have a good palate!?).  Despite all of it's benefits though, it's not hilarious and it simply doesn't go far enough to be as terrifying as it could be. This is understandable though, there's a lot of emphasis placed on Pupkin being a \"nice guy\" behind the sheer insanity and this makes for  a lot of uncomfortable viewing & so the moderate not-too-funny, not-too-scary tone fits well but it still makes for a frustrating watch, something that could probably have been avoided without damaging the integrity of the film.",

            "content": "Rupert Pupkin: Better to be king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime. \n\n\"It's no laughing matter.\" \n\nThe King of Comedy has to be one of Martin Scorsese's most underrated films and also one of De Niro's most underrated performances. This film, like many have said, has a style that is similar to Taxi Driver, and since it's again a Martin Scorsese-Robert De Niro film, it's easy to lose this one in the shuffle. Although being similar to Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy definitely has a life of its own. There's so much to like about this movie.\n\nRupert Pupkin weasels his way into talk show host Jerry Langford's limo after his show. He pleads with Jerry to let him go on the show and that he's a stand up comedian, but Jerry explains to him that he has to start at the bottom. Trying to get rid of him, he tells him to call his office and they'll set something up. Rupert thinks this is his shot at the big time, but when he calls the office, he is ignored. So he goes into the office, but slowly begins to realize that he's getting the brush off.\n\nThis is a great film about the worship of the celebrities and also the desire to become a celebrity. This is even more relevant today then it was when the film was made. Also, I loved how insightful the writing of Rupert's stand up comedy was to get a little background into his early childhood and see why he seeks the attention of the world. I believe this is something that is glanced over when I read other reviews that say there isn't enough character development of Rupert's character. His stand up comedy it tells it all, as he says early in movie, in one of his practice/fake meeting with Jerry scenes, that he takes all the screwed up stuff from his life and makes it comedy.\n\nThe King of Comedy is an excellent film from Martin Scorsese. Robert De Niro is outstanding as the delusional and tragic figure of Rupert Pupkin, and Jerry Lewis is a surprise as Jerry Langford. He's terrific in both the real life scenes and Rupert's delusional fantasies. This isn't a film to be missed. It may not be talked with Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, or even Casino, but this is every bit a great Scorsese/De Niro collaboration.",

Great direction, writing and performances; all round it hits all the high notes for me and you\u00e2(TM)re even left with a small mystery at the end. But more of that after this very brief summary.\n\nRupert Pupkin is obsessed with celebrity comic and TV host, Jerry Langford. He inhabits a fantasy world where he and Langford are close friends; as well as being extremely rich and famous (of course). Having conned his way into Langford\u00e2(TM)s car one evening after a show, with the help of another fan, Masha. Pupkin starts pestering Langford to give him a spot on his chat show. Not wishing to appear rude, Langford tells him to ring the office and they\u00e2(TM)ll arrage to look at his work. Of course Pupkin takes this much further than intended and eventually ends up in trouble with the building\u00e2(TM)s security guards. But how much further will Pupkin take his obsession? I think I\u00e2(TM)ll leave it there or the Spoiler Police (Comedy Division) will be measuring me up for clown shoes (again).\n\nWith Scorsese in charge you know the film is going to be well made; and he doesn\u00e2(TM)t let us down here. It\u00e2(TM)s an excellent production with some trule excellent performances. Talking of which; I have heard from several sources that this is considered the best; or certainly one of the best; performances from Robert De Niro. I must say his portrayal of Rupert Pupkin is quite stunning and I\u00e2(TM)m struggling to disagree with that assesment. I also thought Jerry Lewis did and excellent job as Jerry Langford; a more serious role for him and I thought he played it very well. Also worthy of note were; Diahnne Abbott as Rita Keane and Sandra Bernhard as Masha.\n\nI love the way Scorsese switches the action between reality and Pupkin\u00e2(TM)s fantasies and back again. It really keeps the audience guessing just what is real and what is coming from inside Pupkin\u00e2(TM)s head. This is where De Niro really shines; it\u00e2(TM)s his perfromance that gives it creedance; Pupkin\u00e2(TM)s dilusions become real because Ne Niro makes them appear so. It\u00e2(TM)s a masterful performance I must admit. As to the mystery; well, is the ending real or is it another of Pupkin\u00e2(TM)s fantasies? Scorsese leaves us no clues which I think is pretty cool.\n \nSteelMonster\u00e2(TM)s verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n\nMy score: 9.2/10",

De Niro is outstanding as the psychotic we sympathize to . . . well, on occasion - and Jerry Lewis plays the tired, worshiped idol of De Niro's Rupert Pupkin to perfection. As said by other critics, the film doesn't feel like it really has a center to balance on, and while that may hurt the film from being called a classic, it helps the film become something much more ambitious and much more memorable than if it had been any other way.

De Niro's acting and performance as Rupert Pupkin is as good as and as unique as that of Jake La Motta or Travis Bickle. I've lost words now for De Niro's acting skills. \n\nThe film is significantly different from every other Scorsese movie but is still one of the most refreshing and unique stories told on screen! The movie's not a masterpiece or something but its really solid and enjoyable. The beauty of the movie is that throughout the movie one would think Rupert Pupkin would fail miserably... Flaw after flaw after pathetic flaws; but he doesn't fail... He comes out as a winner... He shines bright... The end as well as the movie is really classic... Some dialogues are really hilarious and some are really hard-hitting! Some scenes make you laugh out loud and some just manage to disturb you! Overall, a brilliant movie.

It's an excellent black comedy that satirizes our obsession with the celebrity lifestyle (whether it is wanting to be personally connected to them, like Sandra Bernhard's character, or the crazy things some people do in trying to become one, like De Niro's). It also has one of De Niro's finest performances too, he plays a more likable variation of the psychopath that was Travis Bickle (Scorsese named it as his favourite performance out of all their collaborations!) Supporting performances are all top-notch as well, especially the dramatic turn by Jerry Lewis, who pokes fun at his own image, and who I've noticed has taken a lot of stick for his slapstick works. An amazing OST, steady direction and great cinematography cap the lid on this gem of a movie. A must-not-miss, surely.",

He is the best. Streets ahead of anyone else in the game and universally adored by one and all, unable to walk the street without constantly being delayed by admirers and autograph hounds, and after taping his show he must pass through a sweaty feverish throng of well-wishers and overzealous fans.\r\n\r\nIt is during this running of the gauntlet one evening that Langford meets Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) - whether he wants to or not. Pupkin squirms his way into Langford's limo after a stroke of luck and against his better judgment - or perhaps to avoid further argument Jerry allows Pupkin to ride along for the short journey to his hotel.\r\n\r\nIt is during the trip that Pupkin informs Jerry that he of course admires him greatly, but that further to this he sees himself as someone that could suit the show as a guest. It turns out that Pupkin is immensely confident of his stand up abilities, so Jerry ultimately decides to agree to listen to his stuff and will consider him for the show as long as he can provide a tape of his work.\r\n\r\nAll good so far right. But as we learn quite rapidly Rupert Pupkin is not some talented no-name trying to fast track his way to the top, but a largely talent free never-will-be with incredible delusions of grandeur, delusions that manifest in the basement of the home he shares with his Mother where he runs his own variety show - complete with laugh track - and interviews the same cardboard cut-outs of real celebrities every night, while Mum continually yells at him to keep the noise down.\r\n\r\nThe following days see Rupert continuing to role play while he waits for news from Jerry and the production company staff. When this is not forthcoming Rupert visits the company offices. Frequently. Of course Jerry doesn't come out to meet with him personally, so to Rupert's surprise he is left dealing with what he views as 'underlings', he decides that this breakdown in communication will be best solved by going direct to Jerry himself.\r\n\r\nWhile Rupert's view of his own abilities and reality are poles apart, he still manages to talk a good game, so much so that he convinces a dubious barmaid to accompany him to a 'meeting' with Jerry one evening. A meeting that does not go well.\r\n\r\nFar from being daunted and calling it a day, Rupert and a similarly 'intense' fan of Jerry's named Masha (Sandra Bernhard) - all 6 foot two with a face of 'ewwww' -  concoct a more extreme plot, one that will guarantee they get attention...\r\n\r\nUp to this point I was less than overwhelmed by events as they unfolded. Rupert's bizarre self confidence even in the face of an obvious lack of true capability was more embarrassing than fascinating, which is why the awful acts on American Idol are the ones they replay 37 times per season. The train wrecks are always infinitely more memorable than the actual talents.\r\n\r\nBut does that  provide a lick of entertainment? Perhaps in another film but not here. Not The King of Comedy. I found the finale contrived and extremely unlikely. After all can you imagine how hard it would be to meet Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods, let alone have enough time to take things further... I mean unless you were a cocktail waitress or a cheap floosie that is. Bad example.\r\n\r\nWhile I yield the point that The King of Comedy is indeed a disturbing tale of what some ordinary citizens will do to share a moment in the spotlight, I can't say it is a great one. In fact I don't care how you spin it, who stars in it and who made it. The King of Comedy is the epitome of 'just a movie'.\r\n\r\nFinal Rating - 6 / 10. Now that I have the Scorcese-freaks riled up, might I add that I found De Niro's performance a little TOO over the top?\r\n\r\nIf you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com for over 800 reviews and plenty more good stuff...",

            "content": "Considering within the previous ten years, Scorsese released powerhouse films such as \"Mean Streets,\" \"Taxi Driver,\" and especially, \"Raging Bull,\" one would not get substantial effect from this movie, also starring Robert de Niro. I was shocked! Rupert PUPkin (De Niro), not Pumpkin, is a man who wants to break into show business as a stand-up comedian and through the likes of a TV television personality Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis). The viewer is tricked a variation of times through intercutting scenes, with the thoughts that \"yes, Pupkin is now a star\"; \"no, he is not yet a star\"; and \"perhaps, he will be a star.\" This eventually leads to Pupkin so desperate that he and deranged female sidekick (Sandra Berhnard) kidnap and hold Langford at gunpoint. The film is evil, vicious, annoying, hysterical, hilarious, and excruciating in ways that predecessor films of Scorsese were, but very different in comparison. De Niro demonstrates versatility within his career in an excellent performance, and Lewis also give a really one to accompany his. It is a sad character study, but it is a really funny film. Interesting how the swearing in this film is minimal in comparison to Scorsese's other major hits, both before and after. The scenes where De Niro is yelling at his un-seen mother may have inspired the scenes between Howard Wolowitz and his mother on the sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory.\" Here is, yet, another great film by the master director, starring one of the best actors of all time.",

If his performance doesn't work the entire movie fails, he's just outstanding. When i saw Sandra Bernhard's name in the credits i cringed a bit but i was pleasantly surprised, she gives a great supporting performance. Also Jerry Lewis is fantastic. Scorsese's direction is subtle but once again great. The scene of Lewis alone in his apartment or how he doesn't use a reaction shot during DeNiro's monologue are just a few of the many brilliant scenes he crafts.",

            "content": "Robert De Niro and Jerry Lewis star in Martin Scorsese's darkly comedic satire about media obsession, and the lenths people will go to in order to become famous. \n\nRupert Pumpkin (Robert De Niro) is an aspiring stand-up comedian with ambitions that outweigh his talent. He sees television talk show host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) as his idol, and is willing to do anything, including kidnapping in order to get Langford to give him his big chance to become the star he's always seen him self as being. \n\nLewis and De Niro give some really good performances in their respective roles, and it is a joy to see them playing off one another. Lewis seems really grounded and downplays his schtick tremendously, but I think that is all for the best. De Niro is wonderful at playing these desperate, pathetic types who you feel bad for, even though you maybe shouldn't.  Sandra Bernhard is terrifically nuts as an obsessed Langford fan and stalker who agrees to help Rupert with his scheme. She's really unhinged and sometimes grating, but it is quite funny and a job well done. \n\nIn a lot of ways, this really felt like Taxi Driver, but, uh, with jokes, and not quite as dark and gritty. When I first heard about this film and its plot, I really was expecting it to be quite dark, gritty, and intense, especially with Scorsese at the helm. Surprisingly though, the film is only PG, but it still manages to get its point across without being too extreme. I believe there's probably some sort of word for being able to pull off a feat like this without things coming off as watered down, but I can't think of it right now. Maybe it's nuance, perhaps genius.\n\nThis is another one of Scorsese's films that is quite terrific and well made, yet unfortunately more overlooked and underappreciated than it deserves. It's not a brilliant masterpiece or anything, but it's definitely quite solid and enjoyable (though not for all tastes), and fits in perfectly with Marty's oeuvre. \n\nIf at this point, you like what I've had to say, then you should definitely go give it a watch.",

Like Peter Weir\u00e2(TM)s THE TRUMAN SHOW, the film is a comedic gem, medicated with the highest possible dose of political satire; ironically, any comedy mastermind would ruin it. Had Woody Allen done it, he would have delved into the characters\u00e2(TM) persona too far, quite possibly so much that we could see some unintended and unsubtle hypocrisy. Had Mel Brooks directed it, it would have become a nonsensical joke-fest with all too much emphasis on the stand-up comedy and not nearly enough on the underlying theme of mania. Martin Scorsese tackles it perfectly. You can\u00e2(TM)t expect a film from him without some sort of violence (except last year\u00e2(TM)s family movie HUGO), even if it\u00e2(TM)s a comedy. The first person to bring obsession to crime would certainly be him. I especially love the scene in which Langford is confined to a chair, held at gunpoint, a phone in front of him, and Pupkin is raising up cue cards (some of which are upside-down or blank) for Langford to read to tell someone in his office to make Pupkin the \u00e2King of Comedy\u00e2\u009d on the upcoming show.\n\nREAD MORE ABOUT THIS OVERLOOKED CLASSIC:\nhttp://themoviefreakblog.wordpress.com/2012/04/28/review-the-king-of-comedy/",

Scorsese proves in this film he is able to work and adapt in any genre, as this film is a combination of so many genres, and touches on almost everything in Scorsese. His eye for talent, his wit and his ability to tell a story in a unique and captivating way. It ends with on a high note, in a very unpredictable way. A great addition to your Scorsese collection.",
