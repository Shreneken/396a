            "content": "This movie tells the story of the most remarkable achievement reached by mankind, when we started going where we are not supposed to go. Just because of this, it is worth watching, even though I don't think this is a masterpiece by any means.\n\nFirst of all this movie was made in a pre-Top Gun era, and only now I realize how Tony Scott raised the bar. The flight scenes are just weak and kill the hype. I also think that Yeager is a bit sacrificed, dwarfed by the screen time given to the Mercury 7 and therefore not as impactful as intended during the ending. They weren't faithful to facts either, for example depicting Gus as a coward, which is untrue. It is also evident by the lack of consequences for him as the story moves on.\n\nHowever, spending about 200 minutes in front of the screen while letting out zero yawns is something to take note of. The pace is great, and there is a permanent yet uneventful tension: a disaster seems always imminent, but nothing ever happens. It's just humans reaching for the stars, which is good enough to entertain most.",

            "content": "The most engrossing and honest space race epic you will ever need to see!\n\nDirector Philip Kaufman's historical drama The Right Stuff (1983) is brutally honest about American life, politics, and the space race from the 1950's and 1960's. I am surely shocked that Kaufman is so honest about the fear the astronauts faced with societal and personal pressures. You see government influence and political pressures of Russia versus America. NASA's start is basically documented here with a genuine sympathy for the astronauts, their wives, and their associates. The Right Stuff inspires awe with swirling space patterns in flight to lights back on Earth looking like diamonds in the darkness from the astronaut's point of view. The Right Stuff is a beautifully crafted picture and a true American classic of cinema, not just for its wonderful space flight sequences, but for its honest heartfelt depiction of the lives of America's first astronauts.\n\nKaufman's artful direction is stylish with vivid imagery and thoughtful storytelling. I'm most impressed by Kaufman's ability to conjure up emotions over the real troubles during the space race as juxtaposed to the ultra patriotic American ideal of space travel. The Right Stuff shows the deeply human flaws and courage of every individual astronaut and spacecraft. It's a neat story about nervous pilots and early make-shift capsules. Kauf should have certainly been up for Best Director at The Academy and won Best Picture compared to his other nominees that year. The Right Stuff is respectful and redeeming of every astronauts' triumphs and failures.\n\nScreenplay writer Philip Kaufman and the novel's author Tom Wolfe really demonstrate how dangerous and argumentative the space race process was for brilliant scientists just trying things out and testy test pilots fighting over glory. Kaufman and Wolfe beautifully show empathy for the wives of the pilots and astronauts, while sympathizing with the stress and pain these pilots endure.I really appreciate Kaufman's honesty over the heavy political leveraging of tenuous government funding, military contract breaking, and the frenzy of media speculation at the time. All because the space race truly was a political stunt for American glory to prove national pride of free democracy over communist Russia's initial space conquests. I love how earnest, mature, and reflective the dialogue feels from Kaufman and Wolfe.\n\nEditors Lisa Fruchtman, Tom Rolf, Glenn Farr, Stephen A. Rotter, and Douglas Stewart have sleek cuts that really use match cuts and parallel edits to startle the viewer into paying attention to every little detail. The editing is phenomenal, creative, and artistic for every scene. No one cuts films like this anymore. I was enthralled for 193 minutes that does not feel half that length. The Right Stuff is stuffed full of epic plane flying, harrowing rocket launch explosions, and grueling training montage sequences. The intercutting of laughing Russian faces over the successful Russian launches is hilarious editing. I was quite touched by the artful editing of cutting to the dead pilots' photos in the bar during the breaking of the sound barrier tests that show the high stakes and heavy cost of human life to the space race.\n\nCinematographer Caleb Deschanel's gorgeous cinematography captures graceful shots from rockets taking off to a lovely shot of coffee being poured into a cup. I am floored by his endless stunning shots of flame igniting, spinning pilot tests, and gently panning shots around the rocket base.The black and warped skies during the flights are terrifying and awe inspired shots. Deschanel's close-up shots of faces are as breathtaking as his careful wide shots that show just enough to really put you in the astronaut's boots. The long tracking shot following footsteps running down a hallway to steady camera shots in board meetings and engineering rooms are all fascinating. The warm lighting is really pretty to look at throughout The Right Stuff. Deschanel's iconic shot of the astronauts lined up and walking in slow motion down to the rocket has entered pop culture iconography.\n\nSam Shepard's pensive acting as Chuck Yeager is subtle and reflective with his careful movements and speech. Shepard shows you that adrenaline rush of the pilots as well as their cautious knowledge of piloting dangerous new rockets. Shepard represents great, true pilots and the respect they command from their fellow fliers.\n\nScott Glenn really said he was up for all of the astronaut training segments as you see him in nearly every training montage, hilariously getting shaken and spun around. Glenn gives you every emotion from bravery, fear, humor, worry, outrage, and reflective pause as Alan Shepard. Ed Harris is very serious and mature as astronaut John Glenn. His loving support for his stuttering wife and clear leadership among his fellow space pilots is confident and lived in as a dramatic performance. Dennis Quaid's big mouthed, hotheaded, fierce pilot Gordon Cooper is very funny and even likable despite his faults as a man.\n\nFred Ward's moving portrayal of guilt as astronaut Gus Grissom is quite something. You see all of Grissom's guilt and supportive feelings on Ward's agonized face. Ward delivers a funny and charming supporting actor role, while redeeming Grissom as a man and astronaut for his bravery and conflicted feelings. I love that he calls Quaid \"Hot Dog.\" May Fred Ward rest in peace knowing he gave an earnest redemption for Gus Grissom's nervous early opening of the rocket capsule's blast doors with a heartfelt sincerity. May Gus Grissom rest in peace as an American hero as significant as his fellow astronauts.\n\nBarbara Hershey is thoughtful and captivating with her speeches about being loyal to your spouse, feeling free in life, and knowing the dangers of their perilous work. I found Barbara Hershey realistically concerned in a brilliant dramatic performance as well as being stunningly beautiful. Kim Stanley is funny as the plain speaking, rough, older bartender Pancho Barnes.\n\nVeronica Cartwright is hysterical as the upset Betty Grissom when she cannot meet Jackie Kennedy and is distraught over the military not honoring their agreements to Gus and her. Pamela Reed is absolutely outstanding in The Right Stuff as the sympathetic and long suffering wife Trudy Cooper. She's so individualistic and honest that her character feels the most like a modern woman here with real insight and sincere worries over her husband's life for these NASA flights. Pamela Reed also looks gorgeous here with a charming and cute beauty.\n\nScott Paulin's Deke Slayton is playful and ever ready to go in scenes. Charles Frank is competent as astronaut Scott Carpenter, with his competitive nature. Lance Henriksen is nice as the steadfast astronaut Wally Schirra. Donald Moffat's raging Texan Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson is a riot. You see his furious need to outdo the Russians and his fits are funny when Johnson did not get his way. Levon Helm makes for a reflective narrator and a likable Jack Ridley, who helps Sam Shepard to fly.\n\nMary Jo Deschanel is incredible with her sad stuttering and nervous support of her husband Glenn. Deschanel is actually married to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel. They're the parents of Zooey and Emily Deschanel for a fun fact. You really feel bad for her in The Right Stuff. Scott Wilson is excellent as the cocky, yet cautious pilot Scott Crossfield, who is jealous of Yeager's wife Glennis as you can see in his eyes. Kathy Baker is very fun and sympathetic as Mrs. Shepard. She's got a tough and supportive attitude. Jeff Goldblum and Harry Shearer are hilarious as NASA's nerdy astronaut recruiters. The real Chuck Yeager cameos as Fred the bartender in the beginning scenes too if you look out for him.\n\nProduction designers W. Stewart Campbell, Geoffrey Kirkland, Richard Lawrence, and Peter R. Romero's NASA sets look so realistic and ornate. There's also a grounded quality to all the numerous buttons and rocket sets. You absolutely feel how realistic everything looks in The Right Stuff. George R. Nelson and Jim Poynter's set decorations make the astronaut homes look humble and NASA's base look brimming with scientific gear and consoles.\n\nComposer Bill Conti's sweeping score has a lovely melancholic tone and a perilous tension for all the flight action. I am always delighted and humbled hearing Conti's music in a movie ever since I heard his breathtaking score for Rocky. Truly one of the greatest composers who ever lived. The Right Stuff will make you tear up at some point just due to the majesty and grace of Bill Conti's magnificent film score. They even use legendary composer Gustav Holst's \"Mars, Bringer of War\" from his Planet Suite for Glenn's launch among other classical pieces scattered throughout The Right Stuff like De Bussey's \"Claire De Lune.\" I also enjoyed the 50's and 60's pop and folk tunes used in the soundtrack.\n\nSound designers Mark Berger, Pat Jackson, Richard Hymns, Tim Holland, John Benson, Randy Thom, Todd Boekelheide, Karen G. Wilson, Jay Boekelheide, Thomas Scott, and Andy Wiskes creatively fade in voices and burst rockets forth from their launch pads. Every jet engine roars to life and planes crashing and taking off have rarely ever sounded so exhilarating. This sound design clearly took notes from 2001: A Space Odyssey and must have inspired how they did the sounds for Top Gun and Apollo 13 to my ears. Karen Bradley and Yvonne Curry's make-up nails the 1950's and 1960's glamour for the ladies and the gruff natural look on the guys.\n\nIn all, The Right Stuff is a supremely entertaining movie with endearing characters and cool rocket flights that hold you in suspense every single time. Additionally, Philip Kaufman's direction is as fearsome and artful as any great auteur could have accomplished for a space race film as epic as The Right Stuff.",

            "content": "Regardless of how significant the event, history becomes streamlined and simplified in the popular imagination. In the case of space exploration, it's not a real exaggeration to claim that half a century down the line, most of the events prior to Apollo 11 are gradually lumped together as a general formative period rather than a diverse range of fascinating pioneers of exploration. Maybe it's the uniformity of the crew cuts, but the test pilots and early astronauts that found themselves in the cockpit in early NASA seem to be painted with a broad brush in their current perception, clean shaven all-American bright-eyed gentlemen who can do no wrong. The Right Stuff, while clearly a dramatization, gives a much more entertainingly varied look at the personalities involved, less formal portrait photos and more visits to the bar. A dedication to practical effects and gaps filled with excellent, boundary-pushing model work give the action scenes plenty of substance to keep the tension high, even decades down the line. While the program veterans themselves and the author of the source material may disagree with the critics on the quality of the film, I believe that the viewing experience is still sharp today and remains an excellent piece of film that avoids falling too deep into generic American patriotic sentimentality and pushes back against the established notion of these early pilots as infallible, while still giving them their due credit (Mercury astronauts waddling through the halls essentially holding their bladders closed defrays that prospect, though posterity seems to agree that they likely gave an unnecessarily damaging portrayal of Grissom). A look at the Mercury program and other early steps in the development of the American space program that was so well done that it has never been really revisited with a major studio budget, despite the sustained interest in Apollo and the many films that have emerged as a result. (4/5)",

Episodic in nature, The Right Stuff moves along at a nice clip despite the three-hour running time, helped along by an impressive cast.

            "content": "Three hour films can often feel like a real chore as it is difficult to keep a film feeling urgent and lively for that period of time while also keeping characters and smaller details in mind. This is a film that hardly feels as long as it is because director Philip Kaufman miraculously pulls together the stories of several different astronauts to present the audience with a vision of mid-century America and what drove these men to achieve so highly. The film is funny without losing sight of the inherent drama of men putting their lives on the line and it is a miracle that the screenplay balances all of these elements without feeling weighty or jarring at any moment. If it had been any other year this film would have been deserving of being named Best Picture but my personal affection for Terms of Endearment (1983) prevents me from considering it the best in the lineup.\n\nPilot Chuck Yeager, Sam Shepard, breaks the sound barrier in 1947 despite having broken his ribs while out horse riding with his carefree wife Glennis Yeager, Barbara Hershey. He continues to push himself as other pilots break his records but with the introduction of arrogant younger pilots Deke Slayton, Scott Paulin, Gordo Cooper, Dennis Quaid, and Gus Grissom, Fred Ward, his era would appear to be coming to an end. The three younger pilots pursue careers as astronauts and are put through strenuous tests before being selected as one of the original seven astronauts. Joining them are the media savvy John Glenn, Ed Harris, and the immature Alan Shepard, Scott Glenn, who both struggle to handle the new pressures of becoming an astronaut. The men eventually band together after initially clashing and support one another as they are each launched into space.\n\nThis is one of those epics where you feel that you truly know the characters, their relationships and their motives at the end of the film while also having a sense of the greater events occurring around them. Each character is set up wonderfully as the first thirty minutes is devoted to establishing Yeager as the \"Ace of all aces\" and showing why every pilot that came after him modeled themselves upon him. The film continues to weave new characters into it's story as the cocky Cooper is immediately shown to be an unlikable figure and we appreciate the fact that he is cut down a little when he meets the other pilots but through his relationship with his wife he is humanized. Fortunately this is not one of those films where the relatives of the main characters have a few obligatory scenes in which they express their concern over their husbands dying and are afraid of the impact the press have on their children. This film is unafraid to show the women lapping up the media coverage as Grissom's wife Betty, Veronia Cartwright, is angry about the fact that she will not be able to meet Jackie Kennedy due to her husband's minor failure. Yes, Glenn's wife has a speech impediment and does not want to face the media and in one scene the wives commiserate over the dangers their husbands face but the wives become so much more than that and are the sort of flawed individuals that we see in real life.\n\nThe film is also a technical marvel as the aerial sequences are extraordinary and have you on the edge of your seat despite knowing that most of these men will survive. The sympathy that you feel for Grissom as he flails around in the water after nervously breaking free of his pod by pushing at the escape hatch, against orders, is drawn from the fact that Kaufman is unrelenting in displaying his struggle as he thrashes around and contrasts this with the calmness with which the operators extract the pod from the water. Glenn's horrific fall to earth while his ship is on fire is seen largely through a close up shot on the terrified eyes of Harris but one is still dazzled by the special effects employed to show all of the splendor of being in space. The film deservedly won Academy Awards in all of the categories that it was nominated in and as a technical achievement it still impresses 36 years later.\n\nThe emotional heart of the film is Yeager as we see the man who gave life to the idea of a pilot be passed over in favor of a younger generation. He drops out of the film for long periods of time but his presence is felt as his influence is acknowledged towards the end of the film in an answer given by Cooper to a television reporter when asked who the greatest pilot in the world is. Throughout the film he has told his wife that he is the best with total self assurance but as he begins to talk he realizes that it is in fact Yeager who deserves the recognition. The end of the film serves as a tribute to Yeager as he heads out on one more flight to prove that he still has it and despite having to eject himself from his plane he shows that he is just as tough as any man half his age. \n\nThe performances are uniformly excellent as several well known stars settle into their roles and we are able to divorce our expectations of them from the roles they play. Shepard gets one of the best parts as the determined Yeager with his hard stare and ability to convey a great deal of emotion in just a stare. Most of the characters are \"good old boys\" and we have to believe that they are larrikins of sorts so there would have been plenty of room for broad characterization but all of them resist this temptation. Quaid is brilliant with his irritating little grin as he convinces as a man with little self awareness but he matures effectively into a figure who is still a goof but who respects his fellow astronauts. It is hard to imagine anybody other than Harris playing Glenn as he brings a conviction and passion to the part that few other actors could have. The performers should have received more recognition for their work as while it is easy to see the film only as a technical achievement it excels on other levels too.",

It combines good writing, behind-the-scenes \"dirt,\" and strong characterization with a first-rate score to create a film I've watched many times over the years, and still holds up well.

I'm so annoyed with how bad I thought it was in comparison to all these fawning reviews I was motivated to join the site and post my first review.  \n\nFirst of all, I'm not a pilot and I've never flown supersonic, but even I know that the scenes depicting the test pilots' race to break the speed of sound and then continue going faster was silly.  Clouds have mass, especially thick cumulus clouds.   No way that Yeager or any of those other guys would have been trying to break speed records by flying through clouds that generally weigh thousands of pounds (look it up).  And when planes going that fast go out of control, they don't spin around like they were being thrown into the air by a third-grader.  Aerodynamics don't work like that.\n\nSecond, the movie is long. I mean, L-O-N-G.  I watched it on TCM and Manckewicz was talking to some guest who said the director Kaufman was ordered to cut the movie to a reasonable time but he refused because he just didn't see anything that could be sacrificed for his artistic vision.  So the movie gets released,  no one goes to see it, and it's credited with causing the movie company to shut down.  Sometimes the studio has it right.  This would have been much more tolerable if it was 2 hours long instead of 47. (Or maybe it only seemed like 47...)\n\nThe tone of the movie is maddening, because there isn't one. Sometimes it's pure historical drama, sometimes it tries for poignancy, sometimes it tries to be a screwball comedy - it's like someone rolled dice every morning before shooting to decide what mood they were going to try to set. The result is an awkward, disjointed mess.\n\nLastly, and this is just personal preference, for the most part I was not fond of some of the casting. Shepard's a great playwright but I always found him to be a mediocre actor. Same with Barbara Hershey. Same with Fred Ward.  Ed Harris does OK here. Jeff Goldblum's talents are squandered.  Quaid and Scott Glenn, especially, do a  nice job, but not enough to redeem this mess. I remember the only acting performance that really made me lean forward and pay attention was  the small part of Jack Ridley. I recognized that lazy southern accent - it was Levon Helm from The Band.  I wish he had done more in front of the camera before he passed away.  \n\nSo this is a longer review than most, and you're probably bored by now.  This will give you some small sense of what I spent 3 hours doing trying to watch this movie hoping that at some point I would see why so many critics loved it. I guess I'm more with the unwashed masses with this one - and they all stayed away. You should too.....",

            "content": "When I look down the cast list of The Right Stuff I cannot complain at all. Some of my favorite actors are sprinkled throughout this film and they are crushing these performances. Each character is unique and stands out as an individual. It's a huge cast, so some of them don't get a ton of time to make an impression, but I think most of them pull it off. Special recognition goes to Jeff Goldblum and Harry Shearer for injecting some great moments of humor.\n\nAs for the story of The Right Stuff, it is an interesting historical film. It has the feel of a biopic, but it doesn't focus in on one person. Instead it explores the history of the early manned missions into space. It's a topic that I am intrigued by, but I'm not sure it needed to have the entire first section of the film with the test pilots competing for the fastest flight speeds. In fact, the presence of Chuck Yeager as a character was a real mystery to me. \n\nThis is a long movie and so on reflection I thought the entire opening act (before the creation of the space program) could have been cut. This is not how I felt when watching it though. It felt like a smart setup because they would establish Yeager and then have him mentor Gordon Cooper, who would then take that knowledge into his astronaut career. But they barely spoke to one another and Gordon Cooper did not become the star of the film. He was there, but shared the spotlight with others. \n\nThere were so many things I wanted The Right Stuff to do, I kept having visions of what it could be. I wanted it to center on one character's journey, but it would only do that for a couple scenes and then moved onto the next guy. I thought they had potential to make a big theme out of the way these men would support and help one another through the program, but after touching on it for a moment you don't really see them lifting one another up. The movie didn't even get to the moon landing.\n\nI didn't dislike The Right Stuff at all, there are a ton of high quality elements in it. I didn't get bored or annoyed by the film, even though it was longer than I'd usually like. However, I never felt myself locking into the story. I would watch a segment and hope to see how this was going to tie into the next sequence, but it rarely did. The entire movie felt almost like a TV show because it was a series of short stories all mashed into one film. Not a bad movie, but far from what I hoped it would be.",

This is reflected in the film's poor box office performance despite rave reviews from the critics.  The film chronicles the transformation of military test pilots into NASA astronauts during the space race of the 1950's.  If you are interested in either of these topics, the film will prove to be informative and entertaining.  If you are indifferent to either of these topics, this will be the longest 192 minutes of your life.  I watched the film in two chunks on separate days and I still found myself counting down the minutes until its ending.  The film's length is a result of the emphasis on Chuck Yeager.  It bothers me that the film introduces Yeager as what you would assume to be the main character, and then he disappears for nearly 2 hours before coming back at the end.  He is included in the story because the future of space travel began with his fearlessness as a test pilot; however, his inclusion adds a significant amount of content to a story that does not concern him.  This film received a slew of Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Cinematography, and Sam Shepard for Best Supporting Actor (ironically as Yeager, who shouldn't have been in the film).  It was deserving of its wins in technical categories like Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Film Editing, and Best Sound, but I just wasn't impressed with the overall film.  The acting of Ed Harris and Dennis Quaid is impressive, all of the training sequences are cool, and the filming of the Mercury missions truly brings space flight to life.  \"The Right Stuff\" is an interesting look at NASA's entrance into the space race but I'd prefer to watch a 1-hour documentary version.",

My only minor criticisim was that perhaps the seperate strands of the stories don't weave together perfectly, perhaps this works better in the book.  Really minor faults though, this is great.

They don't really fit in well with the rest of the film and it fells like a second director came in for those scenes.  Also there is a poorly dubbed Mexican in the film which just comes off as insulting.\n\nBut there are some really good moments of this film.  It opens up with them trying to break the sound barrier; and the fears and difficulties in that task.\n\nIt's one of those films that your grandparents would probably like, provided that they can pay attention for that long.\n\nIt has its moments, but those moments have been done better in other films.",

            "content": "Said to be an unforgettable tale of aviation heroism and nominated for many Academy Awards, The Right Stuff sounded like an inspiring piece of entertainment.\n\nMy first thoughts are that The Right Stuff is a film that would have been more powerful 32 years ago than it is today. Perhaps audiences back in the day were more able to be amazed by the technical aspects of the film and had different expectations for the film, but as times have changed audiences have grown to expect more fast-paced and exhilarating cinema. Of course The Right Stuff must be acknowledged for the time of its production among other things, but I guess that just suggests that it has not aged too perfectly. When I say that, I mean that audiences these days are more likely to be desensitised to the film's depiction of Astronaut training due to it being depicted in countless other films since. None of them have the extensive focus on little details like The Right Stuff does which remains admirable, yet at the same time that kind of focus really slows down the film. The Right Stuff runs for a total of 192 minutes which clearly makes it an extensively prolonged film, and running at that pace makes it one that audiences must be patient about. Yet when the film is not exercising its strong technical values or its depiction of Astronaut training, it takes audiences through a tale of very many characters with their own personal struggles, and that is not always compelling.  There are a lot of characters and subject matter put into the 192 minutes that The Right Stuff runs for, but that still isn't enough time to fully establish a connection to the surplus of dynamics being fit into the narrative. Perhaps it was back in the original day of The Right Stuff's release, but by contemporary standards it feels like a bit of a stretch. All the little character points seem arbitrary in the face of the bigger picture about the patriotism and heroism that the characters face, and the abundance of supporting characters largely serve as a distraction from the narrative progression.\nHowever, when the film actually depicts the rigorous training that the men must go through to become astronauts, it proves to be inspiring. As the film progressively gets closer to its climax, we see things intensifying more and more for the men being trained and so it becomes easier to sympathise for them. As a result, the mood of the film becomes more involving and so the atmosphere progressively develops its tension. This is where the feeling of patriotism develops, the cast become interesting and the production values of the film really prove themselves.\nFrom a technical perspective, The Right Stuff is an impressively crafted film. The aviation sequences in the film are powerfully shot, and rather than hiding behind visual effects they are all of a practical nature. And as well as this, The Right Stuff makes use of stock footage depicting prior attempted lunar missions and an exterior view of the planet earth very nicely. This all works as a means of contributing to the realism of The Right Stuff, and it renders the experience a valuable one. The most valuable elements of this come from the scenes depicting John Glenn's space journey as the practical effects are shown off with a mediated touch of visual effects which illuminate the magical nature of his space journey in a style which is like a mix of Top Gun and 2001: A Space Odyssey. These are the most truly wonderful scenes in the film because they capture the mysterious nature of space without deviating from the realism in the narrative and the focus on the missionary accomplishment. It is a very stylish film all around, even on the ground with the scenery and production design being extremely convincing in capturing the high profile nature of the Edwards Air Force Base aeronautical research. The cinematography is also very impressive because it illuminates the large scale of the story while emphasizing  a lot of little details within the visual plane, effectively ensuring that the visual experience is capitalised on.\nThe musical score of The Right Stuff is also extremely powerful, and this is due to the versatile nature of it. It is intense during the more dramatic moments of the film, energetic when the story gets patriotically heroic and just very effective overall in emphasizing the scale of the story. All in all, the production values of The Right Stuff make a powerful contribution to ensuring that the recreation of real-life aeronautical research and heroism is powerful enough to transcend the long experience that the film is. And even if the dialogue scenes may tend to drag on a bit, the cast remain dedicated to giving it their all.\nIn his breakthrough performance, legendary actor Ed Harris plays a role which equals that of the characters around him in terms of screen time and story relevance. But he stands out among the cast because he has the charisma to transcend everyone. He still maintains the status of an everyman astronaut rising up to a large challenge, but he is more interesting because he remains tenaciously involved with his character on a notably physical edge. His facial expressions say everything about what he is feeling, and when he speaks he lets it all out with an intelligent understanding of what the character is facing and the complicated science behind the missions. Ed Harris paved the way for a much-deserved career with his performance in The Right Stuff, and it makes his Academy Award nominated effort in Apollo 13 from twelve years later all the more relevant.\nSam Shepard is also powerful. The way that Sam Shepherd delivers his lines so directly and refuses to dance around the drama of his character but rather confront it directly. Because of this he remains deeply involved in the role and consistently delivers all his lines with easy dramatic charisma which draws audiences in and brings out the best in the actors around him. Sam Shepard's restrained but effective dedication to his character and his ability to let the dialogue flow naturally from him with understanding and emotion pays him a lot of credibility as a member of the cast in The Right Stuff.\nLastly, Dennis Quaid is also a notable presence. Dennis Quaid injects his natural charm into the role of Gordon Cooper which allows him to be both a heroic addition to the patriots of the story and add a minor sense of comic relief to the tale at the same time. The instinctive sophistication that Dennis Quaid maintains over his line delivery as well as the slight touch of humour makes him a very likable character and gives him an attitude that differs from the characters around him very nicely. Dennis Quaid is a powerful addition to the cast in The Right Stuff, and his passionate line delivery is very admirable.\n\nSo while The Right Stuff is long, slow and overstuffed with characters, its production values are exceptional in portraying real-life aeronautical heroism and the cast is brilliant.",

I was also genuinely impressed with how the stock footage was implemented into the film, especially with the varying ratios and colour changes. The music is also successful and feature many familiar music that would have been heard elsewhere since the films release.\nUnfortunately, in my opinion, I feel The Right Stuff would be more enjoyable to viewers with any interest in this aspect of the past. The film flows along at a slow pace with many instances of a possible end. For those without an interest in this particular topic may find it a struggle to reach the end without constantly checking the time.\nAgain this is not to say it is a bad film. It is clear a lot of work has been put into it. The only issue I have is the running time which could be shortened to make it flow easier for others.",

I think the film's main flaw is that it takes a while to get to the actual story of Project Mercury, which is the interesting part of the film. Granted the time before that is devoted to character development and setting the stage for things to come, but it does feel like a bit of a drag at times when you know there's better stuff in store. The cast and score are both amazing, as is the editing style. Pace, as I said, is an issue, but the way everything is cut together really makes the film stylish and doesn't feel very rudimentary. Phillip Kaufman directed the hell out of this movie, and it shows. While not perfect on all edges, it's still a fantastic film.",

I'll tell you something, and you guys too: No bucks, no Buck Rodgers. \n\nKind of entertaining but a bit idealized in the portrayal of some characters: John Glenn, (played by Ed Harris), was portrayed as a really nice guy and almost too perfect. Nobody is that perfect or that nice (no offense to the Mr. Glenn). Sam Shepard's character, Chuck Yeager, was also a bit idealized. I mean, I'm sure he was a kick-ass pilot but could he have really survived a fall like that, let alone walk away defiantly from a crash like that and with those extensive injuries. Otherwise, the chemistry of the cast was really good; they were a good old boys club and were good as an ensemble. Unfortunately, Dennis Quaid seemed to always act like his character in \"Great Balls of Fire\", why is that? He's so capable of delivering a better performance. It was pretty interesting learning about the events that transpire during the space race with the Russians and what incredible feats the space program then was able to achieve. It was so amazing and so impressive. Overall, the film was alright, I would have wanted to have seen it when it came out, it seems so dated now, either than or I'm just too jaded in my old age.",

At times it can be a bit long-winded and unwieldy, but for the most part The Right Stuff is fully demanding of one's attention throughout it's massive running time. Just as the book is frequently considered the best novel about the space race, the same could be said of the film adaptation in regards to movies that have touched on the subject.",

The pilots tired of engineers' incompetence, insist on having a flight, and, finally, get even with the Russian. That would be a good ending to the film but despite the fact that the film is already 2-hour-long, the scriptwriter seems to be enable to stop. He continues the saga with another pilot who wrecked the satellite capsule, yet another one who returns back to testing fighters, and breaks the world speed record together with his plane, the same pilot who nearly escapes death after the satellite's return capsule malfunctions, and tells a lot of other irrelevant stuff without a meaningful story, until the length of the film exceeds 3 hours.

Shockingly, it appear as though the Moon is a very musical place, or at least it should be, because I'd imagine being on is boring without some tunes. Yeah, being trapped billions of miles from civilization, on a giant rock in the black vacuum of space, which can explosively decompress your lungs if just one thing messes up in either your helmet or suit; it doesn't get any more boring that insufferable claustrophobia. This film is right, if you're going to do something as insanely dangerous as that for the sake of science, then man, you need \"the right stuff\"... baby, this evening. Seriously though, it would appear as though \"Philip\" Kaufman is the real \"man on the moon\", and I must say, sorry Andy, but I like it that way, because the boy seems to have the right stuff to take on a project like this. Now, whether or not he has the right stuff to make these three hours go on without getting to be too much after a while, well, I'm going to have to say not so much.\r\n\r\nThe film suffers a tad from an ever so occasional uneven focus, paying too much attention on one subplot, only to rather jarringly slip into another out of nowhere. These jarring transition isn't helped by the fact that the over focus is supplemented considerably through padding, either by repetition or, most of all, excess, superfluous material. There's not much epic sweep to this sprawling film, though there is much filler and over exposition as we witness the hardly abriged and surprisingly hardly layered progress in this very talk-driven central mission, with a fair couple of cliches within the story making the progression more bumpy. Still, at the end of the day, the central problem with the film is that it is just so very slow. It's not nearly tedious; in fact, the film is rarely all that dull, yet the film remains rather sluggish in its very steady progression, and that alone makes the film rather underwhelming, let alone when it goes plagued by an uneven tone, losing oomph and gaining it back in such inorganic fashions that, after a while, not even the more oomphy parts hit all that hard. Much like some of the test rockets, this film launches strong, only to slow down considerably until it finds itself running the risk of becoming an unrewarding venture, yet where those rockets sputtered and wrecked, this film carries on, never quite living up to the promises made by the strong beginning and concept, yet still carrying enough of its own right stuff to carry on and hit considerably more than miss.\r\n\r\nIt would appear as though, for a while, if you wanted your film to look reasonably handsome for the most part, with a few show-stopper shots of beauty, then Caleb Deschanel was a go-to guy, for although the cinematography, on the whole, is not terrible stunner, it's consistently handsome, with a couple of shots that really stop you cold. Still, it's not just the look of the film that engages, as the feel for the film is also an engrossing one. Sure, the film rarely punches on an emotional level, yet it is with relentless charm, powering this film during its slower, less eventful moments, while still leaving room to not drown out the fascinating intrigue of factuality. However, when depth does come into play, Philip Kaufman truly accels in a kind of meditative grace that really drives home and enthralls with dramatic depth and intrigue that really extracts the humanity and heroism of this story in an engrossing fashion. Sadly, these glowing moments remain underused, yet the film still always has that charm to run back, and does so with the help of quite the colorful cast that really does have the right stuff to carry this picture. Sure, dramatic material for the performers are, much like the dramatic material within the film, few and far between in presence, yet when they do come into play, our cast of sharp talents predictably provide a humanly strong presence, if not a degree of emotional range. Still, where those impacting moments of excellent acting hit the scene on occasion, charisma is constant among the cast, with each person delivering a colorful and distinctive performance that, when married in atmosphere with the others, create remarkable chemistry that defines the film's defining humanity and leaves the film consistently resonant, as well as stylish and fascinating.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the film hits its cliches and lapses in tone and, ever so occasionally, focus, with padding and over exposition to make worse the slowness which, in it of itself, serves supplementary to the film's ultimate misstep of underwhelmingness throughout long periods of time, yet where the film could fallen as simply that, underwhelming, handsome style that, at times, serves supplementary to the sobering atmosphere that creates the occasional, yet worth waiting for piece of sharp emotional resonance to break up consistent charm, complimented by a slew of charismatic and, at times, emotional performances, thus leaving \"The Right Stuff\" to land smoothly as a fascinating, charming and sometimes emotionally rewarding study on the early days of the pilots of space.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

            "content": "The Right Stuff depicts the early American 1960's space program - better known as the Project Mercury - in epic manner and succeeds well enough in bringing the early space flight times to the big screen. \n\nThe film follows seven Astronauts chosen to be the first Americans to reach space and how they became much celebrated national heroes. In parallel the film follows the legendary American test pilot, Chuck Yeager, as he inevitably has to acknowledge that the Space Program taking priority over the old and more convenient aerial flight era. The early space program proved to be highly captivating and refreshingly new subject as this early cold war space race is much less known than the later American Apollo missions to the moon (at least for us Europeans). The film succeeds well in portraying the hazardous nature of the early days of space race with it's constant mission failures and also how mortally dangerous Astronaut's job really is; which essentially is just firing man into space on top of gigantous firework.  \n\nThe space program side of The Right Stuff is interesting despite the bit annoying tongue on the cheek approach it takes in portraying the astronauts as carefree and larger than life characters. Where the film fumbles the ball is with the script by trying to tell two separate stories in one film. Unavoidably the Chuck Yager's test flight side of the film is left with less focus and turns out to be more of less meaningless in the grand scheme of the film. Thus - in my opinion - the film would have been more coherent and even entertaining had it solely focused on the space program and left out the Chuck Yager's part from the film altogether.\n\nDespite this, The Right Stuff is still worth watching - if for nothing else - for the highly interesting subject and the films epic proportions of covering 15 years of early space race. The film is bit on the slow side and burdened with too much content thanks to Yeager's test pilot affair attached to it; this does not ruin the experience but makes the film lengthier and more burdensome than needed.",

For instance, although I appreciate a little levity in most movies, this movie's attempts at humor are a bit heavy handed, and completely wrong for the tone of the movie.

But the film uses its 193 minute running time to great effect, contrasting the lives of the men and their wives with the broader spectrum of the political and social contexts of the time. And, being an adaptation of Wolfe, there's also the nice undercurrents of countercultural liberal subversiveness at times. \n\nThis is a very well made film, and cinematically yes it is truly amazing. As far as accuracy and history go, well, the film does suffer, and many of the people whose lives were the basis for this were rather critical of the portrayal of the times and events, and even Wolfe was very displeased with how this turned out, but even then, this is still a remarkable and wonderful piece of work, and one of the many great examples of \"they don't make 'em like this anymore\". And they probably wouldn't be able to either, at least not without some major changes.\n\nThat's fine though, because this film does a great job of bringing out a sense of wonder and excitement. These men were real heroes who risked their lives to try to go where no one had gone before, and to try to do it before the Russians, since, at least then, that truly meant something. It really makes you yearn to achieve something great like this, and especially from a relatively low tech perspective. No super advanced computers at that time (being depicted in the film), and no digital technology to tell the film's story with either, so this really makes you appreciate the craft since there's no CGI.\n\nThe ensemble cast is very notable here, and they give some terrific performances. To name a few: Fred Ward, Scott Glenn, Sam Shepherd, Dennis Quaid, Ed Harris, Barbara Hershey, Veronica Cartwright, and Pamela Reed. The cinematography is quite excellent, and overall the film really looks and feels as epic as its story. A main reason for this would have to be Bill Conti's rousing score, especially when the brass kick in, really leaving you stirred up.\n\nThe film mostly uses it's long running time to great effect, giving tons of development to the characters, letting the story breathe, and keeping things from being even more rushed. That said, it does drag here and there at times, but the film also has a nice balance where tone is concerned, so there's a blend of humor, drama, adventure, etc.\n\nAll in all, this is a fine film that, despite iffy history, is cinematically a high water mark for docudramas, and a great look at a wonderful moment in time.",

Philip Kaufman's script was very strong and given that Tom Wolfe did not necessarily want to see his book adapted into film, Wolfe at least has to respect Kaufman showed to the men who took part in the early space program. The acting in the film was very good. Ed Harris did very well as the morally straight John Glenn and I also loved Scott Glenn's portrayal as the fearless Alan Shepard. Dennis Quaid was also great as Gordo Cooper but I thought Kaufman could have done more for the star-crossed Gus Grissom (Fred Ward).

All perform well but personally I thought Ed Harris was the standout here and really captured that wholesome, heroic, 50's family man of the USA that the public lapped up at the time.\n\nThe plot follows the space program and the recruitment of young test pilots to undergo rigorous training to become astronauts for Project Mercury. At the same time the story also follows Chuck Yeager, his high-speed aeronautical flights which included breaking the sound barrier and the snub he got from NASA not being selected for the Mercury programme.\n\nEverything about this film is epic due to the fact its about epic events in our human history, the film is extremely 'God Bless America' of course, the films cover design is bold in red, white and blue, but you can't blame the director for that, this is the US's proud history lets be honest. Most of the film is pretty accurate and does include real footage of actual failed rocket launches and news reel archives/interviews/ceremonies but of course Hollywood being Hollywood there is also much artistic license involved. This doesn't deter from the film as most regular folk won't know the difference but if you read up on the real events you will find issues.\n\nEven though this film was made in 83 the effects are still perfect for the present day, they all hold up extremely well and show what can be done without cgi. Of course you don't see as much as you could with cgi but less is more and what you get with model work, minatures, full size sets and simple lighting tricks works wonders here. The sequences of the astronauts in their capsules orbiting the earth are absolutely perfect and with very little SFX. This too goes for all the inflight sequences with Shepard/Yeager when he flies, the cockpit effects are clearly simple lighting tricks with allot of movement but it looks so real so effective. \n\nAllot of time is spend with the training programme for the Mercury seven before we start to see the missions go ahead, it does build excitement as you watch, like the men portrayed, you wanna see them fly and touch the heavens. All this is interspersed with sequences of Yeager's story and his calm frustration on being left out but his continual push to reach higher attitudes. Shepard's performance here is probably his best as the cool clear headed Yeager, no ego and no over the top 'Top Gun' nonsense.\n\nThere are some slow moments yes but anyone should find enjoyment here despite some historical inaccuracies (were the NASA engineers really Germans?) and downplaying. The story of man's efforts and dedication to break barriers, reach new limits, continually to push further and achieve is a proud one, a history lesson, a very important one at that.",

Eventually, a developing space program, NASA, becomes interested in their activities and wants to recruit them for a potential space mission. As a result, they go through a number of physical, mental, and endurance tests to see if they are capable of becoming astronauts. This very watchable movie, despite its three hour plus length. It actually goes by quite quickly and always spawns interest. The images, which I never knew of, of the rockets consistently failing to take off are fascinating and shocking. One flaw is the during the various tests, the scenes become unrealistically silly, but it surprisingly adds good humour, although it likely irrelevant to the actual space mission.

There are some memorable surrealistic images during John Glenn's space flight, apart from that however, there isn't much focus on space.  The film mainly (and smartly) focuses on it's characters and the trials and tribulations they went through during their tenure with the NASA programs, it's more of a really exciting, really funny history lesson than a piece of cinematic fiction, and i suppose such is the reason for it being such a good picture. \r\n\r\nThe main reason I feel this is an Elevated piece of filmmaking however, is how it's directed.  Most film's reserve their most challenging thinking until the second half and even the finale of the feature, The Right Stuff however, is peppered throughout it's epic 3 hour+ runtime with unnerving short intervals of unexpected, intelligent storytelling decisions that make sense as you watch the film and continue to understand and know the characters of the film.\r\n\r\nThe Right Stuff is a fast-paced epic biopic that's funny and superbly directed, and serves as a great work of American patriotism.",

You don't need to know, or care, about the early days of our space program to enjoy this film. Behind the cool exteriors of the astronauts and the cheerleading of the press we are told the real story of space travel in its infancy -- mainly that we got into it out of fear (how American) and that the U.S. pretty much wrote the rules as the game was being played. Telling the astronauts' wives side and what they suffered through is compelling. A must-see film and yes, one of the top ten movies of all time.",

The film is superbly acted with a great cast of actors, and they all deliver on screen.  The film is well paced, and well directed and does a great job at covering the first big step of America to conquer space. This is a phenomenal film that is a classic and is a must see for people who are fascinated with the space program. Director Philip Kaufman has crafted a solid picture with a great cast. What I love about The Right Stuff is the combination of drama, adventure and comedy. Theres a bit of comedy here and it works well. The Right Stuff is a well crafted film that definitely is exhilarating with wondrous adventure. The Right Stuff is an  epic film about the early years of the conquest of space, and its a film that equally entertaining as it is is interesting. If you love films like Apollo 13, then give this one a view. A very good thrill ride with a superb story of the first Americans in space. The Right Stuff is an excellent film and is a must see film.",

A thunderously high-flying thrill ride that's jam-packed with wicked adrenaline and wonderous intensity.  Director Phillip Kaufman's (Invasion Of The Body Snatchers) Academy Award Winning biopic on the American/Russian space race of the 40's, 50's and 60's was an absolutely splendid piece of cinematic mastery.  Its the seriously satirical and oddly told true story of the events leading up to the first American to orbit the Earth.  Kaufman and company were quite unflinching in showing the amount of preparation and training that went into being one of the first astronauts.  This film will grab you from the very first scene and hold on to you for the entire three and a half hour runtime, its absolutely astonishing for the entirety.  From a technical aspect, this film is second to none, the amount of work that went into the making of this epic is phenomenal.  A towering classic that was decades before its time, I havent seen such brilliantly crafted film in quite some time.  The Right Stuff is \"Apollo 13\" multiplied by 100, its a flat-out gripping, unbelieveably suspenseful, brilliantly captivating, beyond thrilling, triumphantly tense, amazingly gorgeous, gut-bustingly funny, adrenaline-charged and over the top instant classic. This film unloads tremendous thrill after tremendous thrill, its just unmatched in the action column, it also dishes out more satire than ive seen for quite some time.  Despite the long runtime, The Right Stuff is a must-see, must-own kind of film that can be enjoyed by truly anyone.  A monumental masterwork that climbed to one of my all-time favorite films.\n      An epic film deserves an epic cast, and thats just what Phillip Kaufman and company did.  Its packed with spellbinding performances from all involved.  Ed Harris is brilliant as John Glenn.  Sam Shepard gives his best performance as Chuck Yeager.  Scott Glenn was astounding as Alan Shepard.  Dennis Quaid gives a great performance as Gordo Cooper, and Fred Ward does a great job as Gus Grissom.  The Right Stuff one of those films that was well done from every angle that you look at it, inside and out.",

Philip Kaufman's script was very strong and given that Tom Wolfe did not necessarily want to see his book adapted into film, Wolfe at least has to respect Kaufman showed to the men who took part in the early space program. The acting in the film was very good. Ed Harris did very well as the morally straight John Glenn and I also loved Scott Glenn's portrayal as the fearless Alan Shepard. Dennis Quaid was also great as Gordo Cooper but I thought Kaufman could have done more for the star-crossed Gus Grissom (Fred Ward). Like all long films, this probably should have been shortened by 30 minutes but still, it was definitely worth seeing.",

Those women had to sit back and watch the television to see what was going on but at least up in that rocket those men had control. The women had to keep their self control waiting there.

Philip Kaufman is a great director and I would like to see more of his films, if any. This movie was getting a little boring at the end, then there was more action when Chuck Yeager went up to space and lost control of his aircraft. I think \"The Right Stuff\" made me realize that I like action-packed movies or that the actors should be a little active in these kinds of movies. I also liked the fact that this movie was in color.

            "content": "Philip Kaufman best known up till this point for directing the last 70s horror film Invasion of the Body Snatchers and as early as 1980 had replaced William Goldman to work on an adaption of Tom Wolfe's book on the space race from the first pilot to break the sound barrier to the first to orbit the Earth. Kaufman unlike his predecessor was determined to also focus on the test pilots like Chuck Yeager and finally filming began in 1982 for the Oscar nominated underrated classic. You would think from the sound of it the film would either boring, awkward or too documentary like but on all accounts you'd be wrong the film works and very fluidly in the narrative style and for the most part is rather interesting even in some of the less exciting and space exploring scenes. The film also features some pretty good acting even from people who are most definitely not good actors and at times kind of gets a cool modern tall tale feel too it most notably in the beginning when it discusses the sound barrier as a kind of sky monster...yeah it's cooler when they do it watch the movie.\r\n \r\nThe film starts in the desert in Muroc Army Air Field 1947 where such legendary jets as the X-1 are being tested in attempts to break the sound barrier. Chuck Yeager (Sam Sheperd in a great but brief performance) an old war hero is contracted to fly the jet. He's met with some difficulty when he breaks some ribs horseback riding but ironically enough seeing as he's now crippled Yeager fastens a broom handle to help him close the door of the jet and becomes the first pilot to break the sound barrier and conquer the mythical demon in the sky me and the introduction were talking about. Six years later the same base though rennamed Edwards is still a prime spot for pilots. It remains pretty much the same thanks to the Happy Bottom Riding club ran and operated by the humorously named Pancho Barnes and is a gathering place for pilots with the titular \"right stuff\" including Scott Crossfield (Scott Wilson) who has a friendly rivalry with Yeager. New pilots are referred to as \"pudknockers\" until they prove their worth, including Gus Grissom (Fred Ward) and Gordo Cooper (Dennis Quaid in an actually GOOD role go figure) I mention them because they will come into play later. At this point much theorizing is made as to the source of this behavior and many of the wives seem to believe it's thrill seeking mixed with desire for fame.\r\n\r\nFlash to '57, you history buffs should see the significance, the Russian Sputnik is launched. The government turns to NASA to combat the Russians in the you guessed it \"Space Race.\" Jeff Goldblum and some other guys are sent out to find pilots among them Yeager, who is decided against due to lack of college degree. Out of them all during a vicious competition to see who will be the Mercury 7 arise the famed John Glenn (Ed Harris always excellent and in an early role) and Alan Sheperd (Scott Glenn in a much more resigned role). The two have an amusing competition including one where they're taking a dump and respectively whistling the Marines and Navy songs. As I'm sure you could guess Cooper and Grissom are two of the other selected pilots. Some complications arise during the attempts to build a rocket including multiple explosions and this leads to the film's heavy theme in how reckless and insane the desire to beat Russia into Space was. Juxtaposed we see Yeager and others still experimenting with Jets including one Jet/Rocket hybrid Yeager's badly burned and almost dies ejecting from. \r\n\r\nAfter some conflict in the ranks Sheperd is elected to be the first American into space and his successful and nerve racking mission is met with national laud and the group meeting the President (suck it Gump), Grissom follows suit but almost dies in reentry and crashes in the middle of the ocean. The film like reality is muddied as to whether Grissom opened the hatch prematurely or as he maintained the technology malfunctioned. More theorizing is made back at Edwards about how the astronauts are basically passengers not real pilots and chimps could do their jobs but Yeager maintains they're still brave as to all the number of things that could go wrong and kill them all. The films descends into it's final throes with the tale of John Glenn the first man to orbit the Earth. The boys are sent around the world including Australia to respond with transmissions to Glenn and the journey begins. It all gets kind of loopy and stonerish here especially when as he's passing Australia (where Cooper is witnessing some Aborigines doing a strange tribal dance near the satellite) he sees yellow swirls outside the ship later believed to be sparks and endangering his life. But Glenn makes it back OK and we have a triumphant banquet hall scene reminiscent of Star Wars. \r\n\r\nThe Last thing I'd like to comment on is how the Director handles flight scenes. He seems to know we'd be bored just watching the jets and rockets take off and fly and such so he goes back and forth between that, the pilot or astronaut in the cockpit and where it gets cool a kind of blurry strange attempt to recreate what the pilots would have actually seen from inside the aircraft. This is in my opinion the coolest part of the film that makes up for some of the cheesier scenes and dialogue he made a gamble and lord knows in 1983 he could have screwed it up but in my opinion he succeeded admirably in my opinion. What a great film, not to forceful in it's convictions not to sappy but just involved enough that you can enjoy it and feel the characters. It truly has \"The Right Stuff\"....sorry for that.",

A sappy, syrupy telling of how it was to be in the space race with the Russians.\r\n\r\nThe Right Stuff is a 1983 American film adapted from Tom Wolfe's 1979 book The Right Stuff about the test pilots who were involved in high-speed aeronautical research at Edwards Air Force Base as well as those selected to be astronauts for Project Mercury, the United States' first attempt at manned spaceflight.\r\n\r\nThe story contrasts the \"Mercury Seven\" and their families with pilots like Chuck Yeager, who was considered by many test pilots to be the best of them all, but was never selected as an astronaut. \r\n\r\nThis film did not get it's \"wings\" from me.  Although a 5 out of 5 with review books and a 93% from critics (that should know better), this is abomidable in direction and acting all around.  I would have more interest if they didn't make every test pilot a cowboy chewing gum and beer guzzler.   What a shame. \r\n\r\nIt has all the awards and none of the realism. A fan favorite to those that just can't get enough balogney into their lives.  Fluff for naive kids learning remote controls.\r\nAfter 30 minutes into this film it sucked. Sorry flag wavers, this film was made for all those that love legend more than reality itself.\r\n\r\nWatch  2001: A Space Odysee, Space Cowboys or Appolo 13 before even entertaning the idea of viewing this heap of hero worshiping revisionism.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES about the film:\r\n\r\n1    downplaying and sometimes even ridiculing the collective scientific and technical effort of the Mercury program, emphasizing instead the individual adventure and heroism of the test pilots and astronauts.\r\n\r\n\r\n2    Despite immense critical acclaim, and winning four Academy Awards, the film grossed only $21.5 million in North America on an estimated $27 million dollar budget. \r\n\r\n3   Film critic Roger Ebert named The Right Stuff best film of the year, and wrote, \"it joins a short list of recent American movies that might be called experimental epics: movies that have an ambitious reach through time and subject matter, that spend freely for locations or special effects, but that consider each scene as intently as an art film\".\r\n\r\n4   It won Academy Awards for Sound Effects Editing; Best Film Editing; Best Music, Original Score and Best Sound. It was also nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Sam Shepard), Best Art Direction-Set Decoration (Geoffrey Kirkland, Richard Lawrence, W. Stewart Campbell, Peter R. Romero, Jim Poynter, George R. Nelson), Best Cinematography and Best Picture.\r\n\r\n5    In 2005, Tom Hanks had expressed interest in a radio interview in producing a new Right Stuff miniseries in hopes of giving the history and the myths associated a bit more in-depth representation.\r\n\r\n6    Real life subjects of the film like Chuck Yeager said of the film: \"Sam [Shepard] is not a real flamboyant actor, and I'm not a real flamboyant-type individual ... he played his role the way I fly airplanes\".   Deke Slayton said that none of the film \"was all that accurate, but it was well done\". Walter Schirra said, \"They insulted the lovely people who talked us through the program - the NASA engineers. They made them like bumbling Germans\".

            "content": "This ambitious, uneven, sometimes maddening, always fascinating evocation of the Mercury Program is as essential and lasting a film as Philip Kaufman ever made, and as bizarre a mixture of patriotism and satire as has ever infused an intended blockbuster. Indeed, it may have been this very strangeness that led in part to the film's disappointing box-office and its somehow losing the Best Picture Oscar to TERMS OF ENDEARMENT.\n\nPhilip Kaufman's scripting and direction are brilliant in a mad sort of way. It's a remarkably indulgent film, with some scenes (Australian Aborigines conducting mystical practices by firelight, Sally Rand performing a fan dance) which have little to do with the narrative flow, but which are striking in of themselves. It's a grab bag of oddities and goodies: highlights include a cameo by Chuck Yeager, an omni-present press corps played by San Francisco improv group I Fratelli Bologna (whose every appearance is backed by a strange clicking hiss), trippy evocations of space travel created by the avant-garde filmmaker Jordan Belson, pee and enema jokes at the expense of Alan Shepard (Scott Glenn), and a farcical depiction of Lyndon Johnson (Donald Moffat). \n\nKaufman, to his credit, handles it all pretty well, the only complaint being an occasional lack of human connection. While the tone throughout is intentionally a bit mythic, one may still find it a bit hard to get truly invested in the story. Despite this, the spaceflight sequences are engaging, and, as many have commented, the film is amazingly well-paced for its three-hour-plus running time. Kaufman's script is amusing and intelligent, and is able to cover a massive scope of time (16 years, 1947-63) and an enormous cast without too much glossing over. \n\nAlthough the film can seem a bit chilly at times, the actors all do their best to bridge the gaps, and all do quite well. Sam Shepard, as Chuck Yeager, was the only Oscar nominee in the cast, and while it's a shame to single him out at the expense of the others, he's great; a quiet, determined, good-natured presence throughout, folksy but never cloying. He has some great interplay with Levon Helm, who plays Jack Ridley, his friend and strongest supporter--aside from his wife Glennis (Barbara Hershey); a pillar of tough beauty.\n\nAs for the Mercury astronauts, four are strongly profiled. Ed Harris plays John Glenn, and while Glenn is portrayed (and described) as a \"Clean Marine\", Harris is excellent, and in walking a fine line between morality and self-righteousness, never makes a false step. Dennis Quaid, as the brash Gordo Cooper, is constantly amusing, yet he avoids stereotype and obnoxiousness. Fred Ward, as the tragic Gus Grissom, is eminently sympathetic, more so because of his toughness and clear capability, which is useless to him in the face of a simple mishap. Scott Glenn's Alan Shepard, as noted before, is the butt of many jokes, partially as comeuppance for his racism (he delights in imitating Jose Jimenez), and partially due to the shortcomings of his own spacecraft (no way to use the bathroom). But Glenn reins it all in, displaying fine comic skills as well as dramatic ones, especially in the scene where he notifies (John) Glenn of a crisis with his own spacecraft. The interplay between these men and the other astronauts is one of the film's highlights. Unfortunately, Deke Slayton, Scott Carpenter, and Wally Schirra are given fairly short shrift here (Schirra has all of two lines).\n\nThis isn't just a man's show. Mary Jo Deschanel is affecting as Annie Glenn, whose stutter puts her through a great deal of distress, especially when she cannot fight off LBJ and the press on her own; Veronica Cartwright is strong as the long-suffering Betty Grissom, whose repressed frustration at not being able to visit the White House (due to Gus's aforementioned mishap) is powerfully conveyed; Pamela Reed, as Gordo's wife Trudy, brings a sense of depth to her role that the script doesn't quite grant; you can see how weary she is of Gordo's brashness, even as she is compelled to stick by him. In supporting roles, Jeff Goldblum and Harry Shearer, as a pair of bumbling recruiters, are quite entertaining, as is Donald Moffat as LBJ (\"Well, what the hell is a 'jimp'?); the rest of the huge cast are all equally fine.\n\nThe technical aspects are, of course, outstanding. Caleb Deschanel's photography is marvelous from start to finish, as is Geoffrey Kirkland's sweeping production design. Bill Conti's score (apparently based heavily on Holst's \"The Planets\") is sweeping and moving; it's the perfect complement to the picture and won a deserved Oscar, as did the editing, which helps this massive film to move as gracefully as it does. Jordan Belson's space effects, strange as they are, make a perfect complement to Kaufman's idiosyncratic vision; the other effects have stood the test of time quite well.\n\nIn spite of its erratic emotional depth and its occasional descents into farce, THE RIGHT STUFF is a marvelous film, and a quintessentially American film; it's also a must for anyone with a passion for history or space travel.",

This segment seems a little long, but I like how the film parallels the advancements in jets with the advancements in space exploration, and it's a great way of showing just how quickly technology changes. \r\n\r\nEventually, the film makes the transition to the United States's Mercury Program: a program designed to get Americans into outer space in reaction to the USSR's Sputnik. The 7 astronauts are all real and they're all played really well by actors such as Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, and Scott Glenn.\r\n\r\nWhat I like so much about this movie is how it shows the sacrifice these seven men had to go through. The various training assignments and family frustrations are very believable.\r\n\r\nThis film is almost a documentary in that it contains so much information to be learned, but it's about an important time in U.S. and world history that I believe everyone should see it.

            "content": "In 1947, a group of determined men gathered at a remote Air Force base in the high desert of California. Their goal was to break the sound barrier by using a small rocket-powered test plane called the X-1. The only problem was that others had tried before, and not all had survived. Some thought of the sound barrier as a \"demon that lived in the sky\", waiting to destroy any who dared confront it.\r\n\r\nA young wartime ace with a wild reputation named Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard) volunteers to fly the X-1, and spends the night before his flight at the local bar. After a few drinks, he and his wife go galloping off on their horses through the twilight, but a tree branch catches Yeager across the chest, knocking him off the horse and cracking a few ribs. Hiding his injury from the flight crew the next morning, Yeager climbs painfully into the plane and prepares to confront the sound barrier \"demon\".\r\n\r\nThe little X-1 is carried aloft by a large B-29 bomber, then at the right altitude the X-1 is dropped free. Yeager ignites the rocket engine and quickly zooms up into the sky, going faster and faster, closing in on the deadly Mach-1 mark. The plane begins to vibrate, then shake, with Yeager fighting the controls. Suddenly, there is a strange boom, heard by the crew waiting on the ground, and everyone fears that the sound barrier has claimed another life. A moment later, they are suprised to hear Yeager's calm voice crackle over the radio. \"Make a note here would you?\" he asks. \"This Mach-meter must be busted. It's jumped clear off the scale.\" Amazed, then jubilant, they realize that Yeager has done it. The sound barrier had been broken.\r\n\r\nThe desert airbase, now called Edwards, quickly becomes the center for all test and experimental aircraft in the U.S., and every hot-shot jet-jockey looking for a chance to become famous gravitates there. A few years pass, and one such pilot, Gordo Cooper (Dennis Quaid) can't wait to take a crack at becoming \"the best pilot anyone ever saw.\" He finds Edward already packed with others like himself, with Yeager still at the top of the pyramid.\r\n\r\nUnforseen events halfway around the world change everything for these test pilots. The Communists launch Sputnik, and suddenly everything is focused on the race for space. Looking for the first American astronauts, representatives from the newly formed NASA visit Edwards. Cooper sees a chance to stand out from the crowd and volunteers, along with his friends Gus Grissom (Fred Ward) and Deke Slayton (Scott Paulin). Other pilots, such as Alan Shepard (Scott Glenn) from the Navy, and John Glenn (Ed Harris) a Marine flyer, also answer the call.\r\n\r\nTested to exhaustion, the astronaut candidates are slowly weeded out, leaving a mere seven men as the handpicked group that will lead America into space. Basking in their glory, they are stunned to hear that the Soviets have beaten them again, launching the first man into space. Chagrined, they must now play catch-up with the Russians, and Alan Shepard is chosen to be the first American astronaut.\r\n\r\nStrapped into his capsule early on the morning of the launch, he waits patiently while ground control works its way through an endless series of glitches. Shepard's flight was supposed to be a short 15-minute loft into space, and he's been waiting on the pad for hours. Feeling the call of nature, Shepard is forced to \"do it in the suit\", much to the embarrassment of ground control. However, once he's relieved himself, he demands that they get on with it and fire the rocket. \"I'm cooler than you are, so let's light this candle!\" Everyone holds their breath, and the button is pushed.\r\n\r\nShepard's rocket ignites, and quickly climbs into the sky. Subjected to tremendous stress during the launch and then the fall back to Earth, he survives the flight and is picked up by the waiting helicopter. America has its first astronaut.\r\n\r\nGus Grissom is next and his flight goes well, but during the recovery the hatch on his capsule is blown off, and when the sea floods in Grissom nearly drowns. No one believes his claim that there was a fault in the system, and he's denied the hero's welcome afforded Shepard. The Russians make yet another bold move, placing a second man into orbit while the Americans struggle with short sub-orbital flights. Decisive action is needed, and John Glenn is chosen for the next American mission.\r\n\r\nAn unreliable rocket is chosen to launch Glenn into orbit, and the country watches as the risky flight progresses. Thankfully, Glenn's capsule makes it into orbit, and everyone draws a sigh of relief. Soon however, trouble develops, and there is a serious doubt that the capsule's heat shield will protect Glenn during re-entry. Without it, he'll be incinerated. Facing the fact that there's nothing he can do but try, Glenn fires his retros and begins to fall back through the atmosphere at 18,000 miles per hour. As the heat builds up around the capsule, his radio link to the ground is blanked out, and all they can do is wait. Minutes tick by as Glenn tears through the super-heated air. Amazingly, he survives, and American can finally claim they have at last matched the Russians in the space race.\r\n\r\nBack at Edwards, events have bypassed Chuck Yeager. No one cares about high altitude flight or Mach-speed records now, eveyone is talking about spacemen. In one more record-setting attempt, Yeager takes a specially modified F-104 Starfighter up in a dangerous high-altitude flight. Zooming through the stratosphere once more, he pushes his plane to the limit, climbing higher and higher, pushed to a record altitude by the rocket in the tail. The sky around him grows dark as he approaches the edge of space.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the engine begins to stall. The air is too thin and the jet can't keep running at this height. The plane slows as alarm lights flash on the control panel. Yeager looks out at the dark sky around him, and for a moment he can see the stars twinkling just out of reach; he is almost there. But the plane lurches, and begins to fall. There's no control, no power, no way to recover. Yeager is in a deadly flat spin.\r\n\r\nSpiraling down faster and faster, Yeager struggles to get his craft under control, but as he nears the ground, he must either eject or crash. Pulling the ejection control, his seat is fired out of the doomed plane, but the small rocket in the ejection seat has ignited his flight suit, and he plummets through the clouds, trailing smoke as the flames burn up into his helmet.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, the crash truck lumbers out over the flat desert towards the crashed plane. The recovery crew fully expects to find Yeager's smashed body in the wreckage, but something off in the distance catches their eye, and they turn towards it. As they draw closer, the shape becomes Yeager, his face badly burned, calmly walking towards them. He has survived once again.\r\n\r\nAs the last of the Mercury-7 astronauts perpares for his flight into space, the ground controllers hear snoring over the microphone in the capsule. Gordo Cooper is finally getting his chance to prove he has \"the right stuff\", but first they have to wake him up. Laughing, they continue the countdown, and Cooper rides the rocket into space, setting records for the longest space flight to date, and proving, if only for a short time, that he is \"the greatest pilot anyone ever saw.\"",

The film begins in a remote California desert, the home of an obscure Air Force base.  Here American pilots are attempting to break the sound barrier.  One in four die trying.  Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepherd) is the first to do so successfully.  This, along with advances in the Russian space program, help jumpstart the American space program.  Two recruiters (Jeff Goldblum and Harry Shearer) show up at the base (and other places) to begin looking for candidates.  Over 50 candidates are put through rigorous physical and psychological testing before seven are selected for the inagural Mercury space program.  The seven men include John Glenn (Ed Harris), Alan Shepard (Scott Glenn), Gus Grissom (Fred Ward), Gordon Cooper (Dennis Quaid), Wally Schirra (Lance Henriksen), Deke Slayton (Scott Paulin) and Scott Carpenter (Charles Frank).  \r\n\r\nThis epic drama chronicles 15 years and clocks in at over three hours but it never drags thanks to Kaufman's inventive direction and sharp script.

Some of the funnier examples include the man vs. monkey montage, Alan Shepard needing to urinate while he awaits for his mission to begin, and Vice President Lyndon Johnson's frustration when John Glenn's wife refuses to speak to him.  And Kaufman makes sure his characters are not one-dimensional.  Yes they deservedly recieve the hero treatment but he shows they are human too; showing their faults and desires.  Kaufman also shows the anxiety and frustration of the astronaut's wives.  \r\n\r\nThe cinematography is quite good as well, whether showing the gorgeous desert sunsets or the claustrophic confines of the space capsule.  The film is sharply edited too, in fact this film won several technical awards.  The acting is superb as well.  Ed Harris, Scott Glenn, Sam Shepherd, Dennis Quaid and Barbara Hershey (as Yeager's wife) all shine.  \r\n\r\n\"The Right Stuff\" didn't fare very well at the box office upon it's initial release but it's a film that has grown in stature over the years and deservedly so.  It's a strong film that truly captures the American spirit.",

It's the story of one man who broke the sound barrier - and  the seven men who became the original Mercury program astronauts. Part drama, part comedy...and although the story focuses on the exploits of the men, Kaufman also shows the trails and tribulations faced by their wives.    \r\nThe story opens just after WWII as test pilots stationed at an lonely California desert air base take turns trying to become the fastest man alive. Always dangerously pushing their experimental planes to fly just a bit faster than the last man.\r\nThe story then segues into the genesis of the space race between the United States and the USSR. Having already pushed their aircrafts to their extreme terrestrial limits, the test pilots are enticed and recruited to join a newly formed government agency - NASA.\r\nPoliticians and scientists seem to provide most of the comedy in this. Then senator Lyndon B. Johnson is hilarious as he tries to understand a heavily accented german scientist (presumably rocket whiz Werner von Braun). The paparazzi who swarm around the astronauts seem to always be accompanied by the sound of buzzing locust.\r\nThe cast is excellent...especially Sam Shepard as test pilot Chuck Yeager and Barbara Hershey is his wife. Ed Harris portrays the straight-laced astronaut John Glenn who has a publicity-shy wife. Dennis Quaid as the cocky pilot Gordon Cooper and Pamela Reed his troubled wife. Fred Ward as luckless astronaut Gus Grissom and Veronica Cartwright his publicity-hungry wife.

It follows the early, near suicidal attempts by test pilots to break the sound barrier in the X1, as well as their long suffering families on the ground. Following the Russians success in space, the Americans childishly spring into action to compete, realising that a PR opportunity to create some all-American heroes means the early rockets would have to be manned. Kaufman successfully manages to cram a lot into his film - the seven space program pilots are treated with respect for their bravery and hero status , and far from being government pawns they were real pilots who refused to compromise. But the space program itself is often ridiculed for its stubborn smallmindedness, and the media frenzy is a constant harassment for the families. Each pilots flight has a different feel, from nail-biting reentry with a damaged craft through to an almost supernatural experience with cosmic fireflies. It's view on heroism is both respectful and satiric, with Sam Shepards continued, unpublicised attempts to go faster in conventional aircraft, and the far greater pilot skills and bravery required, contrasted with the heavily funded, media-worshipped space race. Some of the effects and synth soundtracks date the film, but nothing which diminishes any of the enjoyment.",

Everything related to the space program is exciting, full of science, drama, adventure, and opening up man's knowledge of the universe like nothing else.\n\n  The scene that really did it for me is when NASA / federal gov't officials are meeting to discuss what type of person to put into space - circus stuntman, pilot, etc.  Then a Navy steward comes running down the hall, his hard shoes kloppy-klop along the floors, and burst into the room announcing, \"The Russians have put someone (Yuri Gagarin) in space.\"  Thus, the SPACE RACE begins.\n\n  \"The Right Stuff\" is very much a product of Hollywood, etched with that stamp of romanticism that remains elusive to any other studio locale in the world.  The acting is great, and the plot weaves and winds between the science of reaching the moon, competition with the Russians, the selection of astronauts, each astronaut's personal odyssey, the astronaut rapport, and a sometimes overlooked aspect -- the German scientists (including Wernher von Braun) who made it happen.\n\n  What really grounds this movie is Chuck Yaeger, arguably America's greatest test pilot.  The scenes in the Air Force training grounds build the movie viewers connection to these times, early on in the movie.  There are some great scenes in the desert diner. It's the simple movie elements at work, character change and dialog, that starts your blood pumping with the romanticism of it all.\n\n  Another great scene is the horse race in the desert between one of the Air Force pilots and his girlfriend.\n\n  For a regular movie, perhaps coming in long at about 3 1/2 hours, this is THE BEST MOVIE about the space race.  It is only surpassed by the HBO Mini-Series \"From the Earth to the Moon\", which will always hold the position as the best video encapsulation of The Apollo Program and subsequent moon landing.\n\n  Nothing that I know of in the 21st Century exceeds  as mankind's greatest moment.

One of the greatest ensemble casts in movie history brings this story to life in such a full scale that they tend to BECOME the people they are portraying. Two of the biggest standouts are Sam Shephard as Chuch Yeagher, the first man to break the sound barrier, but who was deemed unqualified to become an astronaut. Another genius piece of casting is Ed Harris as John Glenn, perhaps America's most celebrated astronaut after Neil Armstrong. There are too many great actors to give credit to them all, but there is not one performance in this movie that doesn't ring completely true. The movie also balances archival footage of actual rocket launches, with outstanding visual effects that still hold up today. The movie is filled wall to wall with American pride, and makes one wish they could've been alive at that time to experience this all first hand. At over three hours in length, the movie is never boring, and my only wish is that it could have been longer. A stirring musical score drives home the struggle and achievements of the first seven Americans in to space. A film that should be required viewing in every American history class.",

            "content": "Entralling, unnaturally ambitious and very funny, THE RIGHT STUFF is one of the great and original films of modern times, and certainly one of the best films made over the last 40 years. It succeeds and works on every level it aspires to. There is not one false note in acting, directing or writing here- this is a beautiful piece of filmmaking right on through.\n\nThe movie is set from 1947-1963, and it is about the transitional period of American heroes, from the lone, mysterious warrior to a group of corporation-type team players. It first starts with the lone hero, who is Air Force test pilot Chuck Yeager, (played by playwright Sam Shepard) who was the first man to fly a plane faster than the speed of sound. Then, it moves on to team players, and they are the original 7 Mercury astronauts, who were part of NASA's first ever manned space machine program in the early 1960's. The connection between these two rather different stories is that the space program's astronauts were originally test pilots- that's where they came from, that's where they developed their skills. Yeager is important here because he is by his own nature a lone warrior in a different era of heroes- that is what makes him interesting.\n\nThis is a movie I have never really been able to put my finger on in terms of what kind of a movie it is. When you see a movie, most movies announce their main genre type straight away- not this one, however. It's many things, really- it's part satire, part human story, part biopic, part drama, part action/adventure, part comedy. It's really a unique movie- but what writer-director Phillip Kaufman has achieved here is really astonishing. The fact that he was able to not only do a great job with, but organize all these creative and logistical challenges into one of the great films of modern times is an incredible achievement.\n\nThis film serves as an example to what every film should be, to a degree- ambitious with its scope; and this film has one of the most ambitious storytelling scopes of any movie I've ever seen. It is an awesome and boldly visionary movie-going experience that does what about 90-95% of filmmakers are too afraid to do- it takes chances, a lot of chances. And it comes out as a great, great time. \n\nI love movies that start off in a period of time and a place with one scenario, and then end with an almost completely different scenario with a set of totally different characters. I love movies that make me feel like I went on an amazing journey with real life characters, and after it is all over, my head is still spinning from all the excitement. And that is what this movie does. THE RIGHT STUFF has become one of my personal favorite films- and what is even more amazing about this movie, is that more than 30 years on, it hasn't aged a bit.",

Any chance that the vaguely cynical/satirical elements of the plot could bog it down are rectified by the surprising amount of humor and exciting \"action\" scenes. I love how fallible and human the astronauts seem, and I know that in the hands of a lesser director (ahem...Ron Howard...), they may have been portrayed as perfect heroes whose flaws turn out to be part of their overall charm. At 3 hours 13minutes, it's perhaps a bit longish, but it's never boring. Unfortunately the end is a bit of a whimper compared to the bang bang bang of the opening, but it was still enthralling.",

Despite the immense star power in this film, everyone shares the spotlight and every actor has a chance to bring out the essence of the role they play.  This movie plays across genres, bringing the audience moments of ingenious humor along with awe-inspiring moments that make us sit back and take it all in.  This movie also goes to show that you can incorporate patriotism into a film without resorting to egomaniacal idolism or frantic flag-waving.  This movie will engross you from begining to end, leaving you with goosebumps and a faint swallow of pride.",

Fine cast but no single actor is allowed to dominate the story. Also avoids tipping over the edge into full on stars and stripes flag waving, (which certain directors would almost certainly have chosen to do). The old footage of the various missions is very well integrated into the film and provides for an authentic period feel throughout. Runs Apollo 13 very close for the best space film to date.",

Couldn't it be mentioned or glossed over instead of examining his life and accomplishments? This could take out an hour of the over 3 hour long film. The acting was good and there were some neat scenes but a lot of the times the film doesn't take time to examine what is truly inspiring and beautiful - \"space\". The point of the film was to give audiences an idea of what the space race was like and the challenges and people involved.

Despite lacking the benefits of CGI, the movie gives us the sense of danger and wonder during this primitive stage of space exploration.  But the human story is obviously central in this movie.  Acting was flawless from this relatively unknown (at the time) cast.  Ed Harris shines, as does Sam Shepard.  One of Dennis Quaid's best movies (and one of his first...I guess that says a lot about the rest of his career).  Personally, this is my all time favorite movie.

I don't even remember the names of many of the characters in the movie.\n\nThe movie moves as a slow pace, it takes forever to get anywhere. And the movie is 3 hours long, and I can't even stand 30 minutes of it!",

This film never quite spoke to me the way I expected it to, but it was certainly one of the most \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell-made\u00e2\u0080\u009d movies I have seen. The Right Stuff ran 193 minutes and I never grew tired of it. In fact, I was craving even more aeronautical and civic history when the credits rolled. Over the top at times, as would be expected of any epic of this scale, especially in the portrayal of LBJ, the raucous media, and the unfair implication that Gus Grissom panicked moments after his capsule hit the ocean. Director Phillip Kaufman manages to amalgamate biting social commentary and satire into an uplifting story of courage, grit and great achievements. The government, military, NASA program and the Mercury 7 were all simultaneously criticized and glorified in this film, which was remarkable considering the smooth narrative. Caleb Deschanel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cinematography was wonderful, Bill Conti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s score right-on and the overall art of this film (costumes, sound, setting) was so aesthetically pleasing, too much so perhaps. The stellar cast was highlighted by a charming Dennis Quaid (didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even realize it was him), hilarious Jeff Goldblum, scene-stealing (better than Hoosiers) Barbara Hershey, a convincing Ed Harris as John Glenn, and so on. Fred Ward's \"Fuckin' A, Bubba!\" was hilarious. But it was Levon Helm (resembling Slim Pickens in Dr. Strangelove) that stole the show with his brief, but powerful, narration and his fine performance in a minor role as Jack Ridley.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was a demon that lived in the air.

Full of career-best performances, including Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Ed Harris, and Sam Sheppard, the film version of Chuck Yeager's account of the Mercury Seven program (from Yeager breaking the sound barrier to John Glenn's orbiting of the Earth) is both thrilling and touching.  For every rousing moment in the air or in outer space, we get several quiet \"non-moments\" that define the astronauts and help us to truly understand their sacrifices and courage.  Director Philip Kaufman is not afraid to paint his heroes as flawed (Gus Grissom's tale is especially heartbreaking), but each of the lead pilots/astronauts being fleshed out makes their achievements that much more spellbinding.  Also fantastic is the film's approach towards Cold War politics, which is alternately amusing, educational, and scary.  Of course, freedom and democracy win in the end, but only after American drive and initiative are put to the test.",

            "content": "One small step for man ?\r\n\r\nThis is the story of the time just before that small step. This is when man learnt to crawl in space. It is the beginning of our peep outside the window of the very limited, insignificant space we occupy in the universe. It is the spirit that drove American science-fiction of the 60s and the idea of boldly going where no man has gone before. This is that same Buck Rogers/James T. Kirk spirit but in science-fact.\r\n\r\nThe story starts with the breaking of the sound barrier. The film opens with a narrator on a flight through the clouds reminiscent of the opening of Dr Strangelove: ?There was a demon that lived in the air. They said whoever challenged him would die. Their controls would freeze up, their planes would buffet wildly, and they would disintegrate. The demon lived at Mach 1 on the meter, seven hundred and fifty miles an hour, where the air could no longer move out of the way. He lived behind a barrier through which they said no man could ever pass. They called it the sound barrier.?\r\n\r\nChuck Yeager (Sam Shepard) will be the fastest man alive, confronting that demon in what to our eyes is a creaky, rickety peace of flying equipment and proving the demon does not exist. That gung-ho energy and will to defeat limits justifies the statistical likelihood of death while trying.\r\n\r\nIt seems that these test pilots throw their lives lightly and willingly in the process of research on how to push back the limits of the technology of movement. It is not that their death is absolutely necessary to the research process. This is especially true when these test pilots work on flying into space, a feat entirely controlled from the ground and that quite literally monkeys could do better.\r\n\r\nBut humans are necessary because the march to go faster and higher and eventually the race to the moon is not simply a game for German scientists working for the Americans and the Soviets. It is that. But it is also an important cold war front of propaganda and dramatic achievement. Tragic deaths are episodes of heroic failure that are as necessary as glorious victories and ticker-tape parades down New York esplanades.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important process of this film is the contrast between the secretive, dusty, private life of the Air Force test pilots in the desert and the extremely public nature of the space program. Notice the transition of the shy Edwards veterans at their first press conference in the space facility. They are quick to follow the example of the more TV savvy John Glenn (Ed Harris) and quickly coin phrases and speech lines that would combine their now rather under-utilised skills as pilots with their new skills as glam stars and politicians.\r\n\r\nIt is this critical, endearing look at Americania that gives much value to this film. LB Johnson (Donald Moffat), senator and later vice-president and chief promoter of the space program as a vehicle of personal and geo-strategic propaganda is a ridiculous character with eminently transparent motivation: exposure for himself and going one up on the Ruskies. \r\n\r\nThe humour with which his character is approached places a context around the merits of the space program that defines humanity as a species dissatisfied with the physical limits of its existence and the cynical reasons that may drive decision makers to sacrifice other people?s lives.\r\n\r\nBut consider how frustrated the pilots themselves were when the sensible ?Cherman? scientists passed them by and flew a monkey on the first ?manned? American flight into space. A monkey is not likely to panic, and if it does, it will not try to mess with the controls. And if the experiment goes wrong, sad as that may be, it will be a monkey that dies, not a man (it is early for the American space program to speak of women).\r\n\r\nAll that sensibility is suppressed when the Russians put Yuri Gagarin into space. Though Yuri did very little but stare into space during his short trip in the great out-doors, it is easier to capture the world?s imagination with the idea of a technological latter-day Columbus than with a monkey obviously oblivious to what it had just been through.\r\n\r\nIt is that political imagination that the scientists cannot grasp. When they first design the man-containing capsule (the pilots prefer to call it ?space-craft? but the USS Enterprise it is not), the scientists neglect to include a window in the design for the man inside to enjoy the view. Two reasons that are not articulated in the film but emerge in the telling. First, a window is necessarily a weakness in the structure of the capsule especially during re-entry. Second, what a man sees out of the limited view of a window he is very likely to misunderstand. Consider the ?fire-flies? Glenn is sure of seeing entertaining him in outer space when a broader view of the great outdoors would have told him just how less charming those flashes of light should have been from his point of view.\r\n\r\nHerein lies the debate that still plagues America?s space program (and now China is also joining that fray). As the now rickety space shuttles increase the likelihood of killing their passengers what are the next steps for astral science. Do we continue to consume resources in struggling to bring people back from the round trips we send them to, or do we focus instead on sending probes further, to study deeper and send more accurate data further?\r\n\r\nBut then again how far can you go if the public?s imagination is limited to toy cars crawling around the sand on Martian terrain without any real risk to anyone?s life and limb? If nobody?s dying, why do it? \r\n\r\nThere is no Apollo 11 (?one small step for man? and all that) without Apollo 1 (Gus Grissom ? Fred Ward in this film ? et alia burnt up) and Apollo 13 (?Houston, we have a problem?). \r\n\r\nThere is no space shuttle program without the burning up of the Challenger and later the Discovery.\r\n\r\nHeroic failure is inherent to success. The tragic loss of battle gives the charge to fight the war. It is crucial to funding programs and to politicians justifying their own existence and the budgets they consume. \r\n\r\nAs American national pride is challenged again by China as it had been by Russia, we may yet see in our lifetime an American (or a Chinese) making a one small step for man (and woman) on the lurid Martian landscape.",

The Yeager stuff was really interesting but didn't necessarily connect with the space stuff so much.  I think they could've separated the two halves out and developed them into two very strong movies.\r\n\r\nAnyway, despite those minor issues this movie is still well conceived, and executed, and fascinating throughout.

It's funny, entertaining, adventurous, awe-inspiring, and really puts into perspective that only a select few are ever willing to put their lives on the line just to spend a minimal amount of time in space. It's a satirical film, depicting a gung-ho NASA program who really seemed to be crapshooting the whole deal, with individuals that wanted to shoot themselves into the outer reaches of space for the sake of fame and spectacle, but they were just as well replacements for the monkeys that would make competition difficult with the Russians. The acting is amazing, with each actor breathing life into individuals that should be commended for their insane bravery. Of special note should be Bill Conti's rad score, which is one of the most exciting scores EVER placed on film. Movies like these are hard to make, but this one just makes all of the pieces fit in just perfectly, providing one of the most thrilling, enjoyable, and fascinating looks at what mankind is able to achieve. Even at over 3 hrs., the pacing is marvelous and a very breezy watch. Anyone interested in space, or anyone remotely interested in the thrill of adventure, NEEDS to see this.",

This was when the United States were competing with its Russian counterpart and speed was the key.

Shepard's performance is particularly important, because of the necessity of not forgetting Yeager during the second half of the film.\n\nVisually it's very good as well but the sheer lenght of the film (over 3 hours) might put off some people but I got through it quite easily without getting bored.",

The woo-woos who don't believe the Apollo missions happened have a dozen or so main arguments, and yet we only seem to be deluged by one of 'em at a time.  The current one is the ever-popular \"why would they send up an untested capsule?\" one.\r\n\r\nWell, kids, today's movie is about that testing, or at least some of it.  It's called \"the Mercury Program.\"  Which would be followed by the testing phase known as \"the Gemini Program.\"  Eventually, as tonight's film shows us, you have to stop dinking around in labs and actually put the thing out there.\r\n\r\nOne aspect of the argument is that they would have never tested these things manned.  Which is a silly argument, when you get right down to it.  If it's designed to be manned, the only proper test for the thing is a manned version.  What's more, these men were [i]test pilots[/i].  It was their job to get out there and fly the untested craft.  If they didn't, who would?\r\n\r\nWhen [i]The Right Stuff[/i] came out, there was apparently some concern that it would basically be one big campaign commercial for John Glenn, but having now watched it, I disagree.  Frankly, he doesn't come off as that great a guy.  He's more concerned with the image than the flying, and the best thing about him--which is a really good thing, I admit--is his concern for his wife, who doesn't want to be the focus of attention.  (This may be part of why he never did become President.)\r\n\r\nThe Gus Grissom this film shows us--by all accounts, very close to the real Gus Grissom--is also not the man the HBs want you to believe he was.  If this Gus Grissom thought there was something wrong with the capsule--even if that something wrong was the mere lack of a window--he would damn well tell the press, and to hell with what the engineers thought.  He wouldn't have been killed in the Apollo I fire to keep quiet, because it wouldn't have taken until the Apollo I fire for him to talk.  He was a great man who might've been first on the Moon, who would today have made a damn fine advocate for space travel.\r\n\r\nWe always forget the lead-up in this country.  Our accomplishments spring, you'll pardon the expression, out of a vacuum as far as we're concerned.  But there would have been no Apollo without Mercury--there would have been no Apollo without the X-1 and those crazy test pilots out in the desert.  To say otherwise, to forget that these things never happened, is inexcusable ignorance, and those who believe it should be ashamed of themselves.",

Exactly! \n\nHere is the story about jet pilots, the beginnings of the space age, and the first astronauts. It's an adventure film, a historical drama, a social commentary, and even has elements of satire all combined into an entertaining film clocking in at just over three hours.\n\nJust like Apollo 13 and 2007's documentary In the Shadow of the Moon, I enjoyed this movie because not only is it exciting and well made, it brings back the excitement I use to have when dealing with anything concerning our exploration of space and the technology we develop to reach it.\n\nThis movie starts off when pilots were still trying to break the sound barrier. This is achieved by none other than Chuck Yeager, played wonderfully by Sam Shepard. Yeager was basically a cowboy of jet pilots. A former war hero, who now constantly went to test planes, even when these pilots suffered a high mortality rate.\n\nThis story jumps forward to Russia's success in putting Sputnik into space, leading to the USA going in to recruit some pilots to put into space themselves.\n\nThis leads to the seven test pilots chosen to become astronauts. Among them there is John Glenn, Alan Shepherd, Gus Grissom, and Gordon Cooper, all played by Ed Harris, Scott Glenn, Fred Ward, and Dennis Quaid. We get to know these men and their wives as they struggle to reach space and become successful in their own eyes, as they are already heroes to Americans due to the press.\n\nChuck Yeager: Monkeys? You think a monkey knows he's sittin' on top of a rocket that might explode? These astronaut boys they know that, see? Well, I'll tell you something, it takes a special kind of man to volunteer for a suicide mission, especially one that's on TV.\n\nThe movie devotes its time to almost all the aspects surrounding the Mercury Space Program, cleverly weaving special effects and stock footage within the film to make it have an authentic feel, especially for its time.\n\nWe are also given few segments in between showing us Yeager, who was never chosen to be an astronaut, even though all the pilots consider him to be the best.\n\nThe movie is long, but never unbearable. Something is always happening, the movie plays very well due to its actors, the great score from Bill Conti, and how well made it is.\n\nThis is a great film about the first bunch of guys that got to go into space.\n\nAlan Shepard: Dear Lord, please don't let me fuck up.\nGordon Cooper: I didn't quite copy that. Say again, please.\nAlan Shepard: I said everything's A-OK.",

I remember when I was young, I was enthrawled with space flight, test pilots and jet fighter planes. I read up and studied about all of these famous men. In particular, one of my favorites was not even one of the Mercury 7, Chuck Yeager.  Their tales of pushing the edge, stories of near death experiments and flying planes were the things to drive imaginations wild.  While I have always had a like for Science Fiction, nothing compared with these real stories of real men. I still have in fact Chuck Yeagers autobiography.\n \nThis movie was great. Showing the competative nature of these men as they went through a space program to prepare them for something no one had done before. They didn't really know what they were getting into and yet there they were put through every sort of test there was at the time. All for a chance to be one of the few to get into space.\n \nIronic as it may be that Ed Harris, who played John Glen, later went on to play a part in Apollo 13. The man just has a face for this type of flick. I really felt for the families of these men. Strapping a missle onto their ass and igniting them. With as many rockets that crashed, blew up and otherwise had disasterous results these women sat there and had to watch as their husbands defied the odds at the time.\n \nThis is a great film, a bit long at 3 hours and 10 minutes, but it never drags. There really aren't any slow parts. It's one high flying space craft, airplane, and witty conversation after another. One of these nights, skip the latest and greatest movie from hollywood and give this new classic a try.\n \nNext Up: [b]The Tuxedo[/b]\n \nWow I'm really getting through the wide gambit of movies today.

            "content": "\"The Right Stuff\" opens in the desert. We meet a man who looks every bit the cowboy. He even rides a horse. When the movie begins, it may as well be a Western. In the 1950s, as the revisionist Western got more and more popular, a common theme was the disappearance of the Old West due to the industrialization of the country. The cowboy we meet is Chuck Yeager. \"The Right Stuff\" is his story, and playwright Sam Shepard gives the role a Gary Cooper-like presence that represents the Old West at the very end of its time. The bulk of the movie, of course, is Tom Wolfe's account of the Mercury program, and the seven astronauts who made history that eventually got us to the moon. After Yeager breaks the sound barrier and becomes the fastest man alive, and the Russians launch Sputnik, the Space Race suddenly becomes big business. We spend most of our time with the Mercury seven - Walter Schirra (Lance Henriksen), Scott Carpenter (Charles Frank), \"Deke\" Slayton (Scott Paulin), \"Gus\" Grissom (Fred Ward), Gordon Cooper (Dennis Quaid), John Glenn (Ed Harris), and Alan Shepard (Scott Glenn). Director Philip Kaufman ably counters the perfection of the public's perception - the home-spun honesty and righteous intellect of John Glenn is never made to seem ironic or false - with the truth of the human frailties even test pilots can have - after his trip in space, Grissom suffers an attack of claustrophobia, and there's a question as to whether he prematurely blew his hatch, or whether it was a malfunction. Kaufman focuses our attention on their wives more than is usual in this kind of ensemble piece, and it gives the magazine cover-boys even more dimension. A nice scene has John Glenn defending his wife's (Mary Jo Deschanel) decision not to allow Vice-President Lyndon Johnson into their home, and the underlying passion Yeager shares with his wife (Barbara Hershey) feeds the rugged maverick image. And it's Yeager who bookends the movie. As the Mercury program comes to an end and the seven astronauts are thrown a barbecue by the Vice-President, Yeager attempts one more record, alone. The cowboy was disappearing, and the spaceman was taking his place.",

I don't want you to spend any time reading this that you could spend actually watching the movie though so I'll keep this to just why it's my favorite film.\nI think that when I watch [b]The Right Stuff[/b], I see these guys, these seemingly ordinary guys, embodying something more than just a dream. They each have what it takes to become heroes, to lead America into the unknown, and the film has a very inspirational and patriotic tone. One quote from the film that really shows this is said by John Glenn (a wonderful Ed Harris) \"I just thank God that I live in a country where the best and finest in a man can be brought out.\" Just so many things to appreciate in this film. I love watching Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard) keep on flying, constantly determined to push the outside of the envelope. I love how the story goes further than just the men; it tells how scared the wives of these pilots were, and how they had reservations and feelings about their husbands' involvement. Just a great, full story.\nI also love the film for its light heart. Throughout the film you get a sense of just how fun it was to work on an ensemble project like this. The sequence when the test pilots train to seal their fates as astronauts is always a joy to watch, as all the characters start showing their personalities. Speaking of which, the acting was superb, and I thank Dennis Quaid for making me laugh everytime he is on screen. Ed Harris never ceases to amaze as the Dudley Do-Right of the crew, and Sam Shepard embodies the man that was Chuck Yeager. Kaufman's space effects were very chilling too, and the special effects crew should be applauded for creating such a lifelike rendition of flight for the screen.\nLastly, I love this film because of Bill Conti's score, full of fanfare and heroism. There are so many memorable themes within this score, and each one gets the inspiration across perfectly.\n*****/***** faster, higher, and further than any other film",
