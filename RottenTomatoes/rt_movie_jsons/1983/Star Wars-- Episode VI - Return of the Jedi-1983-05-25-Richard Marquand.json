It is a fun and exciting adventure that wraps up the story of the original characters and sets up the future of the Star Wars universe. However, I also think that some aspects of the film are weak, such as the Ewoks, the dialogue, and the pacing. The film also suffers from some inconsistencies and contradictions with the previous films and the prequels that followed. The film also lacks some of the depth and complexity that made The Empire Strikes Back so great. Nevertheless, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi is a worthy finale to one of the greatest trilogies of all time.",

The \"leia is my sister\" line is the worst of the original 6 movies. I've watched all of them dozens of times, so I've pretty much memorized every scene of each movie. The Ewoks were the minions before there were minions, and the Death Star shouldn't have been reused. If you watch the movies 1-6, it's glaringly obvious that the choreography isn't nearly as good in this movie as it was in any of the prequels. In spite of all of this, it has many positive aspects. The final fight with Vader is one of the most emotional in Star Wars, and the final defeat of the emperor is oh so satisfying. Vader's redemption felt genuine, and the parallel between the rebellion's celebration and Luke mourning the death of his father is brilliant. For the time, the visual effects are extremely impressive, and it's easy to see why so many enjoyed it so thoroughly. Overall a satisfying -albeit flawed- conclusion to George Lucas' brilliant 6 movie saga. So glad some big company like Disney didn't go and buy it up and make 3 terrible sequels that ruined the first 6 that George Lucas carefully crafted, or something like that.",

Action, I love the action really perfect and I love it so much because its just perfect no one can really say anything different. Acting is always prefect in SW. CGI for the time the CGI is perfect. Villain, I said this before and I'll say it again Vader is one of the greatest villain of all time a lot of villains across all franchises are great but Vader is in top 3 in my opinion. Writing, I think that the writing is great but in some scenes it could have been slightly better. Story is great SW always manages to make the story perfect. Casting is perfect. Characters, I really like the Ewoks I think that they are cute characters and should be used a bit more in SW. Adventure is perfect it really is SW always travels though space which is really nice. Ending I love the ending but I don't know how Luke could have beaten Vader his speed would help him but Vader especially in the Obi-Wan show is shown with immense power and I don't understand how Luke could have beaten him or how Vader could have come how gotten weaker.",

Leia and Han also have a great story around taking down the shield and revealing their feelings for each other. As well I like how Lando gets redeemed by taking down the second death star. The only problem is that the first segment of the movie on Tatooine does drag but it is still an incredible end to this trilogy.",

This was the complete emotional and narrative end to the saga, and where they should have left it. The originals were self contained with a beginning, a middle, and an end.

While the latter trilogy would come close to this level they never quite fit with the darker and more auspicious original trilogy in scope and atmosphere. Our primary protagonists see fitting ends to their stories here, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) all see their destinies fulfilled. Many story arcs are brought to fitting conclusions and heroes are formed and villain's vanquished all with wonderful storytelling and composure in it's final act.",

Well, forgive me for nit picking, but I didn't think the humour is as strong as it was in New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. Plus, while it was evident, the romantic elements weren't as developed either. However, putting these flaws aside, it is still enormously entertaining, thanks to the elaborate set pieces and the well choreographed battles(the final battle especially was a knockout). And I will say that it is a vast improvement over the prequels. The plot is still fast paced and sophisticated, and the screenplay while not as fun still is as imaginative as ever.\n\nI have heard many complaints about the Ewoks. I think it depends on your perspective whether you like them or not; maybe a delight to younger audiences, maybe too sickly cute to an adult. Being a 17 year old female, I thought they were very cute. The acting is still very impressive, with Mark Hamill spontaneously likable in the lead. Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda and his death scene is heart rending, and Ian McDairmund also steals his scenes as the Emperor. Harrison Ford, in an inspired bit of casting is great again as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher is still vivacious and Alec Guiness the great actor that he was is brilliant as Obi Wan. But my favourite is James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader, his majestic booming voice is very ideal for a dark menacing villain. And I must mention John Williams's music, brilliant and innovative, unquestionably one of the best film scores of all time. All in all, while my least favourite of the original trilogy, Return of the Jedi makes for essential viewing. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",

The acting is good overall though not as strong as the other 2 films (Especially Harrison Ford who feels more like he's going through the motions). The highlight is clearly the Emperors acting. The action is very well done although just a step below the other 2 in my opinion.The editing and pacing has some minor issues joining the first and 2nd half together. The editing and pacing hold up much better than I remember as it does feel like the Jabba's Palace scene and the rest of the film feel like there 2 different movies combined but it still works. And my biggest thing I didn't like the Ewoks while I still wasn't a fan it wasn't nearly as bad as when I was younger. My biggest complaint would be that the 2nd half is just mainly a retelling of Star Wars (1977) but it was still well done (The highlight is the fighting between Darth Vader, Luke & the Emperor). Overall it is a classic Science fiction Movie/classic 80's movie and a great way to end the trilogy and the problems it has are all marginal that still make it a classic of its genre but not a all time great like its predecessors.",

The only thing that could have been better is if you look up what the original plan for the second half was. Basically, it would have wrapped up certain things, but set up for an episode 7,8, and 9, to be made in the 80s.

Then we finish it off with a final battle so large, that it's on three fronts at the same time. With the Rebel Alliance fighting the Empire in space while they hold out for the ground assault to disable the second Death Star's shield. Meanwhile, we have Han Solo, and Leia Organa leading the Rebels and Ewoks against the Imperial Bunker. Within this battle we've got the Ewoks beating on the legs of the giant AT-STs with small wooden and stone clubs and throwing rocks at Stormtroopers and hijacking the Imperial speeder-bikes. On top of that, we have a fantastic duel of Palpatine manipulating Luke to harness his anger and use it to fight his father. Until he realizes that he's being manipulated and that Palpatine is trying to turn him to the dark side. All of this culminating in Darth Vader making the ultimate sacrifice and throwing the Emperor down a bottomless pit to his death in order to save his son, thus bringing balance to the force and fulfilling his prophecy as the chosen one. 10/10",

It has lost half a star for additions to it post prequel trilogy, one of the worst of which turns that disgusting Sarlacc creature (sand beast that devours people dropped into it) into Audry from the Little Shop of Horrors, and some other additions.  I forgot about that particular addition, and it made me rage again upon seeing it when recently watching the movie on Disney+. It's original version was far more impressive, as a giant thorny hole in the sand, and much more menacing as a result.  In addition I didn't much care for adjustments to the entertainment in Jaba the Hut's base, those moments seeming to be particularly disjointed.  With respects to original elements, the Ewoks, while cute, do seem to be something of a mistake, in that they occupy too much movie time, with no meaningful amount of Ewok character development - there was indeed a regular one that popped up more often than the others, but they didn't go to any lengths to make that really resonate.   Endor also seemed a location that had little meaning, in so far as that new death star's development was concerned - I suppose it would have been a tactically discrete location for construction, and testing maybe, but it didn't make all that much sense either, in terms of ramping up the stakes!

Richard Marquand (Eye of the Needle) brings a heartfelt love for George Lucas' heroes and villains with his magical finale for Lucas' Star Wars Original Trilogy. Richard Marquand was the perfect director for Return of the Jedi.\n\nMarquand's direction is more character focused than George Lucas' A New Hope or Irvin Kershner's The Empire Strikes Back. Marquand's idea for Luke to return to Dagobah to say farewell to Yoda and keep his promise is touching attention to character arcs and narrative detail. He delivers realistic and playful 80's action set pieces with fascinating tenderness. His nuanced style gives Return of the Jedi the most emotionally moving and raw scenes in all of George Lucas' Star Wars saga. Return of the Jedi is finely tuned to make you cry or stare in awe as these gripping character interactions and witty dialogue from writers George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan.\n\nMark Hamill is phenomenal in an all-time great acting performance as Return of the Jedi's space wizard hero Luke Skywalker. His sincerity in saying that he believes the good Anakin still lives on in Darth Vader is touching. I never cease to be amazed by Hamill's Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi because he feels like a cool hero becoming the man he's needed to be his whole life. Luke is brave in the face of danger and kind when he could have chosen to be cruel. Luke Skywalker is possibly cinema's greatest hero from any film. Mark Hamill's acting is precisely why and brilliantly on display in Return of the Jedi. His nuanced expressions and specific body language as he reluctantly duels Darth Vader or addresses Leia or Yoda is profoundly apt for Luke Skywalker.\n\nHarrison Ford is funny and nonchalant as ultra smuggler and ace pilot Han Solo. His romantic chemistry with Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia is palpable. He's a cool hero in Star Wars with a fun sarcastic tone for all of Han's casual jokes. Carrie Fisher is ethereal in Endor's moonlight scene as she speaks with Luke about her mother. Her natural charisma and gentle performance gives Leia real heart. You can feel the gravitas of Luke revealing Leia is his sister with her stunned, yet knowing reaction. I love how feisty Princess Leia can be gunning down Storm Troopers or choking the life out of Jabba the Hutt. \n\nBilly Dee Williams is likable as the brave pilot crook Lando Calrissian. Anthony Daniels is super funny as the ever complaining protocol droid C-3PO. Peter Mayhew's Chewbacca is funny and still shows his love for his pal Han with hugs and roars.\n\nIan McDiarmid performs his delightfully evil and cackling sadism as The Emperor. His vicious words cut through Luke to challenge his faith in The Force and his father. He's an iconic villain, not just for his perilous Force Lightning powers, but his mastery of manipulation. Frank Oz delivers a wondrous farewell speech from Jedi Master Yoda. His earnest well wishes and parting wisdom to Luke are neat to contemplate. I often ruminate over Yoda's Jedi teachings and morals that Luke must learn.\n\nSebastian Shaw gives a moving departing performance as Anakin Skywalker once he is unmasked as Vader in his dying moments with his son Luke. You can feel how touched Anakin is that Luke never stopped believing he was good inside. James Earl Jones provides Darth Vader's menacing and evil voice. He sounds conflicted as you can tell Vader is considering Luke's proposal to return to being a Jedi. David Prowse nails Darth Vader's body language to display how Vader is contemplating Luke's pleas for Anakin to return to his senses and The Light Side of The Force. His lightsaber duel rages on with Luke for the most thrilling lightsaber combat to date. Every one of Luke's ferocious swings is meaningful with emotional weight and careful swordplay.\n\nAlec Guinness proves his worth yet again as the wise and patient Obi-Wan Kenobi appearing as a guiding Force Ghost to Luke. His confirmation about Leia is fascinating as a concept and gave me hope that Leia would become a Jedi in the future like Luke and Anakin. Kenny Baker moves R2-D2 all over the place, giving the little astromech droid a real personality. Director Richard Marquand even cameos as an Imperial Major driving an AT-ST.\n\nMarica Lucas, Duwayne Dunham, and Sean Barton's editing slickly cuts between Luke and Vader and the rebel space battle for thrilling pacing. Return of the Jedi is a blisteringly fast 135 minutes that only slows down for the emotional climax and fun with the Ewoks. Production designers Norman Reynolds, Fred Hole, and James L. Schoppe actually created tree houses for the Ewoks of Endor with lush greenery all around the Redwood forestry. I loved the throne room set with The Emperor as it's ominous and isolating. Set decorators Michael Ford and Harry Lange create a legendary throne and consoles for The Emperor's chambers. I like all the handcrafted props around Ewok's village.\n\nAlan Hume and Alec Mills' cinematography has moody blue lighting in the throne room, yet stunning natural lighting outside for Endor. The panning shot of Luke fighting back against Vader as they strafe to the left in striking. I love the framing of Vader looking out a space window at the stars. All the matte paintings in the backdrop are gorgeous and hold up beautifully to me for simply lovely illustrations painting Star Wars' world.\n\nVisual effects artists Phil Tippett, Chris Walas, and Paul Huston's green glow for Luke's lightsaber looks better than ever just like Darth Vader's ominously red blade. The Emperor's Force Lightning is still terrifying and looks real like Luke is really suffering. I love all the practical explosions of mini models and toy Star Destroyers. Yoda, The Rancor, and Jabba the Hutt's puppets look astounding with realistic depth, detail, and movements. Puppets over CGI anyday for me. The theatrical version surpasses George Lucas' specialized version every time.\n\nComposer John Williams provides a very tender and emotional symphonic score for Return of the Jedi. Leia's theme is romantic and soft with a dreamy atmosphere. I love how inspiring and moving Luke's theme is when he makes heroic Jedi choices in the throne room scene. Darth Vader's bombastic theme is enthralling just like the quieter and playful flutes for the Ewok theme. John Williams just knew every character and major moment would need appropriately devastating or exciting music. His music on Dagobah helps say farewell to Yoda with respect. \n\nSound designers Ben Burtt and Gary Summers go wild with the starships exploding, Vader's echoing voice and deep breaths, to Luke's searing lightsaber audibly whirring through the air. Burtt and Summers playing all their brilliant noises for C-3PO's recounting tale to beguile his captivated Ewok audience is adorable fun.\n\nCostume designers Nilo Rodis-Jamero and Aggie Guerard Rodgers craft cool camouflage rebel uniforms for Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker. I appreciate seeing Luke in all black Jedi robes to visually symbolize his potential for The Dark Side before he makes his choice to remain a Jedi. The Emperor's black robes, Darth Vader's sleek black armor, to Han Solo's outfit are all iconic looks. Return of the Jedi has that truly iconic gold bikini Princess Leia is forced to don at Jabba the Hutt's grotesque command. You can tell Carrie looked uncomfortable in such a skimpy costume, unfortunately. She looks incredible in it, but I love seeing how comfortable Carrie looks in her camo gear on Endor. She looks like she had fun with the Ewok scenes!\n\nMake-up artists Phil Tippett, Nick Dudman, Peter Robb-King, Tom Smith, Stuart Freeborn, Richard Mills, Graham Freeborn, and Kay Freeborn create striking old age make-up for The Emperor's shockingly deteriorated face. Leia, Luke, and Han have a real glow to their looks. Leia's fallen bangs with her back head braid is a lovely hairstyle on Carrie Fisher and one of cinema's prettiest aesthetics. She even has a cute blush on her.\n\nIn conclusion, Return of the Jedi delivers upon the immense expectations for Luke's hero journey with his fierce moral convictions that define heroism in film. Return of the Jedi remains my favorite Star Wars film to this day with wonderful puppets, humor, space action, and moving performances. It is mesmerizing.",

I loved this movie so much as a kid and I still do; it's obvious Lucas was going for my age group with this movie, but it made me a fan nonetheless. Thankfully, there's so much fan service and emotionally satisfying moments by the end, you won't care that it's probably for kids.",

This was a great way to finish the OG story and say goodbye to the characters. There was room for sequels, but they should have been done in the 2000's after the prequels were finished, not so late that Luke looked like a great grandfather. That way they could have used the EU as direct source material. That being said, I enjoyed the sequels for what they were, and am loving what Disney is doing with expanding the galaxy on Disney+. More Star Wars is never a bad thing.",

            "content": "Weirdly enough after watching the original trilogy as a whole I am unsure which I prefer this film or A New Hope but I do have a knack for enjoying the less celebrated Star Wars entries more than the acclaimed films. That being said I despise the sequels but this film was just so much fun. From the opening sequence to the final battle this film was pure satisfaction. That being said I do have my criticisms. I am going to focus on a few topics, the overall vision issues, originality, and what I am going to call the Porg problem. Lets start with the originality, this film features both a new death star complete with another space battle with a satisfying destructive pay off, an opening fight that resolves and sets up parts of the previous film and current film, Luke going to Dagobah and splitting off from Leia and Han, and final fight with Vader, While the destruction of the death star is done better in the first film I will give the film credit the confrontation of Jabba was more entertaining for me then the battle of Hoth and it was a cool way to update the audience on the ways in which the characters have changed. Additionally it was a cool reinvention of Tatooine and an extremely captivating and sleazy environment. The Dagobah scenes are important in shooting the arrow towards Luke's final arc and the showdown with the Emperor and Vader but the reveal of Leia as Luke's sister was however well handled in this film something that should have been chosen from the start because it makes some scenes in previous movies fairly uncomfortable. The final fight with Vader was also reinvented in the most compelling way possible and seeing Luke prove the Emperor wrong was immensely satisfying especially since we have seen him succeed over and over again from the prequels until this point. Now that we have tackled the first two issues I am going to move on to the Porg Problem. I did not hate the Ewok's. They were a strange addition but they were cute. They did feel a little too cartoony at times as well and also it was kind of messed up to see the Ewok's get taken advantage of by the rebels in order to win the battle. They are seduced by C3PO and his stories and essentially become a fan club of soldiers for the rebellion and its really sad especially in one scene to watch an Ewok clutching the body of one of his own. I also found it kind of distasteful to have the them believe C3PO was a god because he is essentially in a position of power over them. Its clear that the film wanted a fuzzy lovable toy selling tribe of Teddy Bears and while I took a great amount of joy watching the Empire get emasculated by a bunch of Care Bears with spears I think it would have been much cooler if instead of Endor the Empire built their base on Kashyyyk. That way we could explore a little bit of Chewbacca's species and history and have his people tear the arms off of some Stormtroopers. It would feel more like they were fighting with a goal in mind and actually have the respect of the rebels rather than be looked down upon plus it would have been pretty awesome. Still the final battles were incredibly satisfying from the Ewok's fighting the Stormtroopers and the destruction of the base, to Lando's assault and destruction of the second death star. But finally this film makes the prequels feel like their actually part of the story and the lore. Luke's showdown with the Emperor is pretty awesome and builds its tension well as we see Luke give in to the dark side but then after cutting off Vader's hand realizes he is becoming like him and turning to the dark side so he unlike his father defeats his temptations and puts his negative emotions aside. Because of this the Emperor tortures and tries to kill Luke but as we know Vader cares about his son even if he won't admit it just as he cared for Padme and in his emotional turmoil destroys the Emperor at the cost of his life. In his last moments he redeems himself thanks to the love he had for his son. The culmination of all three of these moments results in a giant party with fireworks and the conclusions to everyone's arcs as Lando regains cloud city from the Empire. Luke completes his training and becomes a Jedi Knight. Anakin is redeemed by his son and becomes one with the force. Leia and Han resolve all their tension and begin their romance officially and the entire galaxy celebrates their freedom. The film also makes changes to itself to fit into the future films with Anakin's actor in the prequels playing his force ghost and a few added scenes of Coruscant and Naboo. I commend these changes although I can understand why those who hate the prequels and grew up with the original trilogy may despise them. Overall the ending is extremely satisfying and gave me goosebumps. Honestly I received all the closure I needed and this is a perfect end to this trilogy and a perfect end to the saga. Honestly I am not opposed to new Star Wars films but after seeing the original trilogy for the first time in a decade or so I refuse to acknowledge that any of the sequel trilogy exists in this timeline. I loved this movie and despite a few flaws it wrapped up the trilogy with a note of triumph that left me with great happiness.",

Heck, from an action standpoint, this might be the best of the three, as the Climax is very long, featuring both a Ground Battle and a Space Battle, alongside a third based on Story Resolution, and despite the >30 minute duration, this climax NEVER loses momentum.  While this movie doesn't have the depth of the first two, it does escalate everything that worked before, and because of this, the emotional catharsis from the climax of this movie is sublime -- I honestly can't think of any other Action series that ends with such a perfect emotional satisfaction.

The plot is simple but effective, resolving many of the questions we were left with after Return of the Jedi and ending with the penultimate battle between good and evil in the re-match between Luke and Vader (spoiler alert: good always wins). We get to see more of the Emperor and to understand more of Vader's life as a Sith Lord, and to appreciate the internal conflict he felt towards his son. The special effects and sound effects were once again great - nothing particularly new, but we didn't need them to be new, just reliably great. All of the cast return, and you can tell that they have grown comfortable with their respective roles in the intervening years.

            "content": "Now before you rush ahead and quickly mark my review unhelpful, hear me out alright? Return of the Jedi is the only movie of the trilogy I had no hopes from. I had heard of people saying that it's the worst in the series. But considering I got bored from A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back I thought this one is going to be even worse (why I got bored of them, that's written on their reviews. But still if you're too lazy to check it's because I always somehow get bored watching old movies). So I had absolutely no expectations from it. Turns out it has the most story of all the Star Wars movies.\n\nThe movie began with answering the question as to what happened to Han Solo. He gets rescued by Luke and Leia. We even get to see the iconic Boba Fett in that scene. Later on we get to see Lando. Even though I haven't heard about him and I actually had to look up his name while writing this review, he looks pretty iconic. I don't know if this was a popular look or this movie made the look popular, but I guess the latter is true. There were many other NPC characters throughout the movie, but for me the selling point were the Ewoks. And I don't care what all the \"die-hard Star Wars fanboys\" say.\n\nThe Ewoks are so adorable! I wanted to pull their cheeks. Their scenes were so cute and funny. The way they fought the Stormtroopers or treated C3PO like a messiah was really wholesome. I really wanted to see that kind of stuff in Star Wars movies. Just because it's set in space doesn't mean it always has to blast out laser guns or have huge flying ships. After all, it's set long long ago in a galaxy far far away. There could be many tribes living over there as well. And seeing them hold up makes me believe they still exist somewhere in today's time, having evolved into becoming teddy bears as advanced as humans.\n\nAnd finally Darth Vader's final fight scene in this movie, in my opinion, was way better than The Empire Strikes Back. We actually get to see what Darth Vader looks like, and he hasn't cut Luke's arm for this. This is the correct way of drawing out emotions. The one who is making the audience emotional should be in pain, and not the one being made emotional. Darth Sidious was really intimidating, and I really wanted more of him rather than the trash that Palpatine was.\n\nStar Wars: Episode VI is even today my favourite Star Wars movie. It doesn't matter what others say about it, it's gonna be the most OP in my opinon. In just 2.5 hours it managed to tell more story than the entire sequel trilogy combined. And the best part - the spoilers from this movie aren't even as popular as Episode IV or V, so I could watch it without already knowing what I'm about to watch. I'd absolutely watch it again.",

Where the first two pushed boundaries and innovated, 'Return of the Jedi' was content to do little more than end the story in uninspired - albeit entertaining - fashion. There isn't anything inherently wrong with making a simple, breezy, popcorn-ready flick, but being anything less than ground-breaking like it's predecessors were is a recipe for disappointment. The plot doesn't seem to have any forward thrust; after a thrilling first act, the story settles into well-troden territory by following the blueprint of 'A New Hope' - a gang of rebels must defeat the empire and it's giant destructo-ship. It's unfortunate that the creativity and character development from 'The Empire Strikes Back' couldn't carry over. The movie was still quite entertaining, as any fan of the effects-driven action sequences, so viscerally brought to life by a top-notch technical crew, can attest. Another familial twist and the final redemption arc that sees peace restored to the galaxy are interesting nuggets, and Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor is a scene stealer. 'RotJ' wraps up this trilogy with technical wizardry and fun, but opted for safe, crowd pleasing mundanity instead of creative daring. It could and should have been much more, but ultimately stands as a testament to the complacency that often follows success, and foreshadows the overarching creative issues found in Lucas' prequel trilogy.",

Also, the plan to rescue Han felt really weird, it was very uncoordinated. The death of Boba Fett was unspectacular and disappointing, a really good built-up character died within seconds. Overall I liked the battle at Jabbas basement. The first 40 minutes are really well done. Luke making it up to Han, which saved him just like he did in this movie. A really good callback. Yoda\u00b4s passing scene together with Luke was very sweet, and a great way to say goodbye to an iconic character. Seeing the group of Han, Leia, Luke, Chewie, R2D2, and C3-PO going for possibly one last adventure was great and a real nostalgic factor, which I totally loved. On a critical note, I have to add the speeder fights, which did not age well at all. The fight in itself wasn't that bad, but the pictures and effects looked very bad, just signs of the time. I dug the whole jungle set, though, which in my opinion were a good different location compared to the other movies. R2D2 once again saving the group by helping them to escape from the trap in the jungle was another proof that R2D2 is the goat. C3PO being the god of the Ewoks was a bit weird at first, but I liked it in the end. Luke\u00b4s reveal that Leia is his sister felt very well done and well-written. In another epic moment, Luke first meets Darth Sidious which was a super important moment, and felt like that, too. I was not the biggest fan of the fact that 6 guys and a group of Ewoks are equal in a battle against AT-STs and a couple of hundred stormtroopers. Really epic was the fight between Luke and Darth Vader though. And it felt like it's a tradition to lose an arm in a battle in Star Wars. Vader finally betraying Sidious felt soo good and also was great as a moment. The space battles in the last act are visually spectacular reflecting back to this time. Anakin's goodbye to Luke was emotional by a well-surrounded score, lovely moment. I loved the look on Han\u00b4s face when Leia told him that Luke is her brother, brilliant. It was a brilliant way to end this trilogy, I really loved it.",

Luke Skywalker is in his prime here and he had the best character arc out of everyone in this trilogy. Han Solo felt kind of wasted for a good bit but he was kinda pointless not bad. Doesn't downplay Harrison Ford's acting. Darth Vader's redemption story is the thing that ages well the most of this movie. The score for that whole final battle was truthfully masterful, and the space battle of Endor was one of the best we've ever gotten. The Pit of Carcoon and the whole battle at the Sarlacc  pit was a very good action sequence and we've all got our thoughts on slave Leia. Not essential to the plot and pretty wild for a kids movie but overall they didn't overdo it. This movie shows how little planning their was for the whole trilogy but it still wrapped up the trilogy very finely and solidified this as one of the best movie trilogies ever made",

I did find parts of the plot a little similar to 1977's 'Star Wars', due to the Death Star stuff, but overall I unquestionably enjoyed the 135 minutes.\n\nThe score is great again, while the new bunch of characters are cool.

The ewok battle goes on too long, but the Death Star space battle is amazing and visually marvellous, and everything in the Emperors Throne Room is incredible, best of the franchise stuff. The music is still great, and the sets and effects are great, but the story does become episodic, with some weak pacing in the Ewok Village and Jabba's Palace. However, its always entertaining and rewatchable, and for all its flaws, Return of the Jedi is still a great adventure and a throughly satisfying end to the Original trilogy, with many best of the franchise moments. | Grade: B+",

Han Solo in this movie is not Han Solo. He isn't sarcastic, mean, witty, cool, or even ready to fight for most of the movie. The only time that he was really Han Solo was when he told Luke that he was going to die at his home planet. \"Convenient.\"  2. This is a small knit pick but I just thought that it was weird. Although I did enjoy the final battle between Luke and Darth Vader a lot, there was one thing that threw me off. During the entire battle Luke keeps stating that he's \"not gonna turn to the dark side\" and that basically his anger won't control him. But then as soon as Vader mentions Leia he tries to freaking murder him any way he can. That just made me confused and it made Luke seem hypocritical. But other than that, the final battle was easily the best part of the film. 3. The freaking Build-a-Bear workshop side-plot. Yeah they're cute and all, but our so-called \"rebel heroes\" spent the night with some teddy bears instead of actually continuing with the mission that would save the entire universe. Shouldn't they have been working on a attack plan instead of playing with teddy bears for the entire night? And another question I have is... why was this sideplot even necessary in the first place??? I guess it was to fill up time or something? But other than these dumb things being in the movie, I enjoyed it a lot. The visual effects are great and I loved the music in the final battle between Luke and Vader. Yoda's death was actually done pretty well and it didn't feel forced which was great. Although this movie could have been a lot better, it does its best to put a satisfying conclusion in one of the most famous (probably the most famous) movie trilogies of all time.",

The true ending  of SW saga, respectfully for the special surprise of the planets, ending music & most of all the spirit Force of Anakin(Hayden great cameo)! True Star wars conclusion!!",

            "content": "Pros: Palpatine is a great villain and the best he has been in the saga. Darth Vader is great. Luke Skywalker is the best character in this movie and I love him as a Jedi Knight and how powerful he has become. The Jabba scene is fun.  Yoda's death is quite emotional. The speeder scene is fun and the Ewoks capturing Han Solo and everyone else accept Leia. The battle of Endor is epic and I like the Ewoks and this is the best third act in StarWars in my opinion. The arc with Luke Skywalker is fantastic with him trying not to turn to the Darkside. The lightsaber fight between Vader and Luke is my favorite in the original trilogy. The scene where Luke cuts off Vader's hand is great because he realizes his father did this to him and if he continues he will turn to the Dark side. So he refuses and Palpatine uses sith lightning on him to kill Luke. Darth Vader turning to the light side at that moment is perfect and him taking the Emperor and killing him was great and he phophil's the prophecies of Anakin bringing balance to the force. Vader's death scene is the most emotional death scene in all of Starwars and Luke being the only one at his funeral is really powerful writing. \n\nCons: While the first 40 minutes in Jabba's palace were fun, It feels useless and it doesn't need to be there and it is just there to save Han and is very disjointed. They even had someone break the fourth wall and run up and scream at the camera. The death of Boba Fett is stupid because he just gets knocked over by an item and falls into the monster and this is the guy that captured Han Solo. There should have been a fight and it was not funny and it annoys me. Luke and Leia being a sibling felt odd to me because they never hinted at it in Empire Strikes Back and it came off as weird because there was a love triangle between Han, Luke, and Leia and it doesn't have the pay off it should have had. This movie also got worse after Rising of Skywalker because Vader phophilling the prophecy feels less satisfying because (Spoiler Alert) he is still alive.\n\nOverall I still really like this film even though it is my least favorite in the original trilogy but that's not saying much because it is a good film. I'm going to give StarWars Episode 6 Return of the Jedi a (B+)",

Where the first two pushed boundaries and innovated, 'Return of the Jedi' was content to do little more than end the story in uninspired - albeit entertaining - fashion. There isn't anything inherently wrong with making a simple, breezy, popcorn-ready flick, but being anything less than ground-breaking like it's predecessors were is a recipe for disappointment. The plot doesn't seem to have any forward thrust; after a thrilling first act, the story settles into well-troden territory by following the blueprint of 'A New Hope' - a gang of rebels must defeat the empire and it's giant destructo-ship. It's unfortunate that the creativity and character development from 'The Empire Strikes Back' couldn't carry over. The movie was still quite entertaining, as any fan of the effects-driven action sequences, so viscerally brought to life by a top-notch technical crew, can attest. Another familial twist and the final redemption arc that sees peace restored to the galaxy are interesting nuggets, and Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor is a scene stealer. 'RotJ' wraps up this trilogy with technical wizardry and fun, but opted for safe, crowd pleasing mundanity instead of creative daring. It could and should have been much more, but ultimately stands as a testament to the complacency that often follows success, and foreshadows the overarching creative issues found in Lucas' prequel trilogy.",
