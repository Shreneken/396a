Or could it be Fanny and Alexander, Bergman's semi-autobiographical story of growing up in early 20th-century Sweden?  The first act of the film is a joyous celebration of what it is to be young as young Alexander (Bertil Guve) rollicks through life with the expansive Ekdahl family, a bourgeois group who embrace the joys of music, food and theater.  However, when his father dies and his mother marries a stern bishop, he finds himself at the mercy of the cruel whims of his rigid stepfather. It is a visually stunning film, shot by Bergman's regular cinematographer Sven Nykvist, the first half filled with vibrant colors, the second half with drab tones, clearly representing the contrasts in Alexander's early life and punctuating the significant impacts of the adult influences in our formative years.",

For the most complete version of Bergman's vision, you must watch the television version as the theatrical has been trimmed almost in half. While the film is extremely long, it is never boring or wasting time with unneeded elements. Fanny and Alexander may start off a little slow as it introduces characters and stories, it is so wonderful to watch the stunning cinematography and poetic dialogue that runs throughout Bergman's whole film and for that matter filmography! With both likable and villainous characters and a phenomenal script you can't take your eyes away even for a second. Hearing the dialogue and watching the beautifully filmed settings, you know this is something special. This isn't just a masterpiece but a visual representation that captures Bergman, the believes and ideals and is such, a piece of him preserved in film history forever! While it is indeed long, its a film that needs the time and attention of the viewer and justly rewards those that are willing to do this!",

It was difficult to read all the colored-white subtitles on a 32\" TV!!  The ONLY real ridiculous part of the story for me was how the close-knit and caring mom could dramatically \"turn off\", suddenly wed that conservative Bishop AND permit that turd to dominate her kids' lives. Even in very early 20th century Sweden, I don't believe a loving mom from an educated and artistic, close-knit family would do that.  I can suspend disbelief for all the other absurd happenings in this film but not the mom's sudden submissiveness toward that bully at the expense of her children.",

I'm thinking of ghostly appearances of a dead dad etc. but despite the length it keeps the viewer on side.\n\nFrom a technical perspective the film seems high spec for a foreign language, non-Hollywood production.\nThe set design, cinematography, screenplay and lighting are all top quality.\n\nThree hours of a good film I can cope with but I would  not be able to do five!",

But even the bishop was given a fully embodied human agony and suffering instead of just a villain with pure malice.  The drab bleakness of bishop's counterfeit religiosity contrasted sharply with Ekdhls' effusive, rich, and deeply human love and affections.  The cinema photography made such points vividly from the rich velvety red and green of Ekdhls to the cold stony gray and black of the bishop's household. What a masterpiece.",

Real, tragic crazyness from back in the days. I enjoy being a spectator and the cinematography is to blame together with mentioned acting, script and surprizingly edgy stuff - remember, the setting is put 100 years back. A great atmosphere, I get in the mood for christmas - in a weird way. I'm fearing/hoping it's a mild build-up for bigger happenings.\n\nThe second part is picking up a year later or so and is in the same style. Still a subtle bore-vibe over it, but the acting stays ace. Some bigger moments here as well, but I feel that the film hasen't bloomed just yet.\n\nIn the third part (or fourth act) things bloom. It's more psychological, darker - almost horrifying. It makes me really look forward to the last part of the film.\n\nThe last part and act five is truly a great finisher. It's more exciting, still dark. The great performances continue and we are up for several surprizes.\n\nIn total this is a great play told from kids eyes, but that's easy to forget.\nIt's epical, huge, long and filled with great characters. The manners of spoken words are fascinating and they are delt with so well. It's unexplainable at times, but also very real and probably a personal and nearly autobiographical film from Bergman. A late masterpice from one of few Scandinavian masters.\n\n8.5 out of 10 cognacs.",

On the macro level, like all Bergman films, it wrestles with meaning of life and death, and has his typical memorable existential dialogues. I think it is misnamed. It is not through the eyes of both of the children but only Alexander and secondarily through his mother. There is much that is unpleasant in the film--the bishop and his household seem like allegorical elements for everything the director dislikes about religion--but the passion of the actors is believable, and the sets and costuming first rate.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nDirectors like Stanley Kubrick, Federico Fellini, and Ingmar Bergman are fascinating individuals, adding pieces of themselves into their films; ensuring they are creating a product that is personal and unique. There can only be one of them, and many could try to mimic their style but it would not create the same impact as a piece of them in not found in it.\n\nIt was only recently that I was won over by Persona, finding it much easier to find the appeal of Bergman's distinctive style and the deeper and intelligent themes that lurked behind its story. Fanny and Alexander was not a difficult film to experience, due to its characters being easily identifiable and the journey they go through feels more grounded than what I have seen in Persona. One does not need to give deep thought to its meaning and ideas in order to enjoy what is being shown, simply sitting there and taking in the film's visuals and atmosphere is enough to leave one satisfied.\n\nFanny and Alexander is a beautiful painting of joys and tragedy, and the unpredictability of life itself. It shows that major tragedies could come at the most unexpected of times, and seeing it through Alexander's eyes gives it a larger emotional impact. It is through the aftermath of these strategies, we see how it affects a person, and Bergman executes this in a way that is much different to other filmmakers who try to capture the honesty of death and grief. In this film, Bergman lets these tragedies feel more theatrical, to connect in some way to the inherent connection of the family's performing arts; something that was also present in Persona. The recent passing of Alexander's father has changed him and his sister, but Bergman keeps the film's perspective through Alexander's eyes. It is from there we see his deeper connection of the \"supernatural\" grow, becoming more and more intrusive of his life; but the film doesn't treat these supernatural elements as fantastical or mystical, instead it feels more psychological and human. Alexander sees the ghost of his father walking around him, acting in a particular way because he saw his father struck by death whilst in the role of the ghost of Hamlet's father.\n\nIt was also after the sight of his father's death that his sense of innocence has started to fade away; beginning to conjure up dark and hurtful lies, speaking out cuss words as a way of rebellion against the world and his god. Alexander's lies is also a reflection of his innate connection and abilities to the theatre, to be a storyteller that would draw others in and be convinced, possibly converted in the process. It is sad to see Alexander constantly lie, as it is clear that he has a gift; a gift that could be shared and positively impact the lives of others, and he probably would have walked down a path that allows this, if sudden tragic events did not unfold so bluntly.\n\nBergman contrasts the film's sense of tragedy with joy and happiness during the opening and closing scenes of the film. It is during these times where we see the characters in a much different light, a reflection of what many want for their lives. It is during these scenes that Bergman emphasises the importance of finding joy in life as it is short, not feeling guilty for a bit of luxury as long as it evokes a feeling of happiness. The difference between the two, however, is the ending being darker, showing that Alexander's previous experience has completely changed him, not having that sense of curiosity, wonder, and blind joy that defined him then.\n\nMy core issue with the film resides in its final hour, with Alexander exploring his uncle's store; becoming more in touch with his supernatural elements. It is here where Bergman becomes much more ambiguous, requiring intense attention in order to understand the ideas behind it. I was thankfully able to follow the story, but with a film like this, knowing the story isn't enough; it is the richer and thoughtful elements behind it that make the film enjoyable. It also helped that the magical quality that Bergman carrier during it were executed strongly.\n\nFanny and Alexander features cinematography that is both delicious and atmospheric. The film's opening and closing sequence emphasise the sense of lushness and luxury that fills the Ekdahl home. Sven Nykvist, the film's director of photography, contrasts this during the scenes in the middle where Fanny and Alexander is living with the bishop, where the surroundings are stripped down to their fundamentals, lacking in vibrant colours and artefacts that would create a welcoming atmosphere. It is a place seemingly devoid of memory and warmth, emphasising the internal suffering and sacrifice that the children has made.\n\nFanny and Alexander is great film by Bergman, ending his filmography on a high note, with a story that manages to be personal and spiritual. Though it becomes a bit difficult during its third act, it still managed to keep my attention and curiosity engaged until the very end.",

            "content": "This is more like it. I feel bad saying this, but honestly, the Bergman movies I prefer have plots that mostly make sense. I won't deny that movies like Persona and Passion of Anna are meaningful, but whatever the meaning is, I really struggled to discern it. I prefer movies like this, or The Seventh Seal, both of which tell coherent stories with a bit of a supernatural element.\n\nThere were a lot of great images in this movie, as usual for Bergman. The scene with Fanny and Alexander slowly approaching the room with their dead father and hearing their mother screaming in devastation is really hard to watch, and some people may say it was over the top, but it definitely chilled me. Also, all the sets are gorgeous, and the difference between the various settings really stands out, like the contrast between the red velvet adorning the Ekdahl house and the white ascetic Vergerus house.\n\nThe main issue preventing most people from fully enjoying this movie will probably be the runtime, and that makes sense. Honestly, I was surprised to find that it didn't bother me. The first hour or so are slightly pointless, taking too much time to establish characters, and the plot really begins when Oscar dies. I know that if I rewatched the movie, the first hour would annoy me a bit, because a lot of it could've been cut. But as I was watching it, I enjoyed it, partly because I liked a lot of the characters. Especially the grandmother. She was great.\n\nAfter the ball gets rolling on the plot, it becomes much more fast-paced. The movie really succeeded in making me hate the Bishop from the very first scene where he teaches Alexander not to lie. One issue (I guess) I had with the first hour was that the two titular characters were barely explored at all, so I had no reason to really feel bad for Alexander when his life started going downhill, but I started to like him a lot more once he started being a sarcastic little shit to the Bishop. I was cheering for him, and that made it all the more crushing when he finally admitted that he'd lied.\n\nAs usual, the fantastical elements of the movie gave me pause, like when Fanny and Alexander somehow appear in the attic despite them escaping downstairs. Typically it's a little cheap to use deus ex machina and just explain something as a 'miracle' or 'magic.' Same goes for Alexander somehow making Elsa kill the Bishop. Still, though, even those scenes were haunting and emotional, and the supernatural element is worth it for the scenes with Oscar's ghost. I really liked all of those scenes, especially the one when Oscar speaks to his mother (really, the grandmother was wonderful).\n\nSo overall this is definitely one of my top three Bergman movies. I can forgive some magical realism when it's in small amounts and pertains to the themes of the film. It's harder for me to like when I completely fail to understand it.",

The First Act beautifully explores the family's get-together at Christmas, and sheds some light on the individual families of the three brothers as well. Then the remaining acts go on to follow the ups and downs of the two siblings, Fanny and Alexander, and their mother Emilie, and how everyone in the Ekdahl family tries to cope with it.\n\nEach of the characters in the movie is so uniquely fascinating, and really have something to offer to the combined family as well as the movie. The rich colours and cinematography, the in-depth exploration of the characters' lives, the movie is filled with heartwarming and hilarious moments; there isn't a single dull moment in it.\n\nAll the actors involved with the movie have done a brilliant job, especially the beautiful and charming Ewa Fr\u00f6ling delights us with her talented performance of Emilie Ekdahl. I wonder why I haven't seen her in many movies; she really has the ability to captivate you with her eyes and emotions. Helena's conversation with his son's soul and Isak Jacobi's monologue with the children were really entrancing.\n\n'Fanny och Alexander' is an ornately shot period piece that beautifully studies both childhood and adulthood (not of the same character). As critic Aaron Hillis from 'Village Voice' says so aptly, 'nothing else in his (Bergman) oeuvre addresses so directly his childhood escapes into fantasy as the by-product of a harsh Lutheran upbringing.' It explores many themes like loss, prison-like childhood, polygamy, etc., but the story is essentially about the importance of family. Overall, the movie is quite life-affirming and memorable. Please watch the five-hour long cut to get the director's intended vision and proper impact of the epic.",

            "content": "Regarded as another one of Ingmar Bergman's masterpieces, Fanny och Alexander sounded like another chance to look into the best that Swedish cinema had to offer.\n\nAs Fanny och Alexander is a 188 minute film trimmed down from a 312 minute miniseries, the effect of the film is certain to be different as it loses over two hours of material in the process, and so the tale is not as detailed or extensive as the extended version. But still, as far as it goes, there is a lot of interesting ground covered in the 188 minute cut of the film. It is a long film, but the pace of the story is a gentle and good one. The material ranges from how involving it actually is, but as a whole there is a lot of sentimental spirit in Fanny och Alexander which is what makes it worth watching so consistently.\nDrawing from director Ingmar Bergman's personal experiences in his unhappy childhood being raised by a Lutheran priest, Fanny och Alexander is clearly a very personal piece for the director. In his final feature length film, Ingmar Bergman is able to score himself another Academy Award nomination for Best Director by creating an insightful and touching look at growing up, particularly in its time period and setting of early 20th century Uppsala, Sweden. One of the themes in Fanny och Alexander is how it examines the life of a child, most specifically Alexander Ekdahl as he grows up under the rule of a stepfather who has no sympathy for him and imposes religious power over him. Fanny och Alexander has the kind of premise that a fairy tale usually has before it turns into a tale of magic and heroism. Fanny och Alexander is all about the despairing lead up and sadness that the characters must face, and it is very interesting mainly because of the way the film depicts the relationship between Alexander Ekdahl and his stepfather Edward Vergerus, particularly as the two clash with each other.  In the end, I was surprised just how much I enjoyed Fanny och Alexander because it was a film with a gentle pace which was perfect as it gave the film the ideal amount of time to develop and plenty of room for audiences to look into it and gain a deep perspective. I was so enthralled by the 188 minute cut of Fanny och Alexander that it left me enthusiastic to see the full 312 minute experience. Fanny och Alexander was a surprisingly touching and insightful film which dealt with its complex subject matter with a lot of heart and intelligence, and so it left me extremely enthusiastic to look into more Ingmar Bergman films. Part of the reason that I loved Fanny och Alexander was because it was a Swedish film and because that is a type of cinema new to me. If the film was an American tale I would find it less effective as countless American films have explained what their society was like in every decade imaginable. In Fanny och Alexander, the mystery surrounding its Swedish setting was refreshing to me, and so it reminded me just why I love foreign films. Even though Fanny och Alexander was a 188 minute foreign film, it all went by so gently and organically that I never felt like I was waiting around or that the story was too slow.\nPart of the reason I loved Fanny och Alexander was it had story elements reminiscent of the novel Flowers in the Attic which I am fond of. It deals with a family coming to terms with the sudden death of the father and having to look elsewhere for support. This time however, the issue comes into the relationship between the son and the stepfather which meant that I could empathise with the tale a lot more. It fascinated me, and it dealt with it all in an atmosphere which was dark and intense and therefore gave off the kind of sense one gets from being stuck in the attic of a house which cannot be seen by its inhabitants. Fanny och Alexander's material could have been turned into juvenile melodrama, but not with Ingmar Berhman as director. Thanks to his keen eye for strong imagery, he is able to establish some excellent production design, costumes and scenery for the film which is all captured with terrific, atmospheric, Academy Award winning cinematography. Everything in the film looks great and seem genuine, assisted as well by a subtle musical score which is moderated very well and saved for the perfect moments in the film. In all honesty, Fanny och Alexander is a brilliant film from both a technical and emotional perspective, and it is one of the greatest foreign language films that I have ever seen, easily earning its Academy Award in the same genre.\nThanks to strong direction and an excellent script, Fanny och Alexander can only get better. The cast is the precise thing to prove that.\nThe standout performance in Fanny och Alexander comes from Jan Malmsjo. Jan Malmsjo takes on the role of Edward Vergerus very well because he has a brooding sense of power to him which comes not so much from his status but more so just how he acts in many situations. He has a manipulative sense to him and his power is subtle but stern in his line delivery which really gives him the ability to snatch the screen when he sees fit. Jan Malsjo is terrific in Fanny och Alexander because of the sense of strength he  maintains from within, and his interactions with all the other cast members are rich with dramatic tension.\nBertil Guve is terrific as the titular Alexander Ekdahl. He has a lot of strong juvenile charm to him, but at the same time he is able to handle the dramatic material of the film very maturely. Bertil Guve is terrific because he makes for a compelling and sympathetic young boy, and he interacts with the other actors very well, particularly with Jan Malmsjo due to the intense chemistry they share in the scenes where they go against each other. The angry father and son chemistry that the two share is one of the best elements of Fanny och Alexander due to the fact that it is so raw and confrontine, and Bertil Guve stands his ground in the situations with a firm grasp on reality and strong dramatic charisma.\nEwa Froling does a nice job in Fanny och Alexander because she has a sense of beauty to her which draws in viewers, and her dramatic passion is excellent. She keeps herself involved in the material very deeply by constantly conveying the mental anguish of a troubled wife and mother in a way which is easy and is able to stir up sympathy from audiences without problem. Ewa Froling interacts with the many other cast members in Fanny och Alexander very well and her character development remains impeccable as the story progresses, so she remains a pivotal cast member to the success of the film.\nPernilla Allwin gives a decent performance as the titular Fanny Eckdahl, and Pernilla August does a good job as well.\n\nSo thanks to its excellent ambition, the strong cast and screenplay as well as thoroughly meaningful direction from Ingmar Bergman, Fanny och Alexander is a beautiful and touching Swedish story which does an excellent job conveying the difficulties of growing up in a troubled family situation.",

He's a filmmaker who crafts picture that not only tell a great story, but they rely on a powerful, evocative visual style to really grab your attention. With Fanny and Alexander, he uses a simple idea, yet he brings it to fruition with a superb cast of talented individuals, and it's a beautiful picture that easily ranks among the finest ever made. The story follows two children and its adventures they experience with their family. What follows is a striking story that you cannot forget, and is hard to tear yourself away from because Bergman's picture is more a work of art than actual film. This is a must watch if you enjoy a finely crafted genre picture, a film that resonates with the viewer and uses a simple plot to its advantage. Of course what I appreciated the  most about the film is the fact that Ingmar Bergman doesn't overdo anything with the film, and like many of cinema's finest artists, he does phenomenal work with using so little, and it works very well. Fanny and Alexander is a picture is engaging from start to finish, a film that has power in its visuals, acting and direction. If you're a cinephile you owe it to yourself to watch the film.

(The best way to see it is in Criterion's 5 DVD set, which has both the television and theatrical versions, as well as two DVDs of \"making of\" and other commentary).\n\nFANNY AND ALEXANDER deals with the great two preoccupations of Bergman's career, namely the absence of God and the unbridgeable gaps between human beings, but the result is wonderfully life-affirming. Fanny and Alexander are the children of Oscar and Emilie Ekdahl, actors in Uppsala circa 1907, but the film gives a panorama of the extended Ekdahl family, presided over by grandmother Helena, uncles Gustav Adolf (a restauranteur and the film's most comedic presence) and Carl (a professor who has fallen into debt and is trapped in a loveless marriage), their wives and children, and the selfless Jewish shopkeeper Isak Jacobi. This Swedish family lives in an Old World opulence that is hard to believe for audiences today, especially for a country whose class system by and large disappeared after the war. The rigid interaction among people not closely acquainted and the deference of servants to their employers make for gestures as alien to us 21st century viewers as a Noh play.\n\nIn a way, FANNY AND ALEXANDER is like those big novels of a century ago, by Tolstoy or Galsworthy, dealing with the vicissitudes of a whole family. The vaster family drama, however, is only a backdrop to a more personal one: Fanny and Alexander are soon orphaned, and their widowed mother eventually remarries, this time with a cruel clergyman. The children move from the freedom and comfort of the Ekdahl home to the austere bishop's place, where the children are punished for the slightest infraction by beatings or being locked up in the attic. The Ekdahls' torment living under the bishop is the great crisis of the film, and their unexpected liberation from it presents Alexander with a burden that he will carry into his budding manhood.\n\nThe original television version is the way to see Bergman's final masterpiece. Don't be daunted by the length: 5 hours should not be a problem in an age when people will watch an entire season of a sitcom on DVD in one sitting. FANNY AND ALEXANDER is not slow, meditative cinema like, say, Andrei Tarkovsky or B\u00e9la Tarr, but rather Bergman is always presenting the viewer with some engaging drama. The theatrical cut, which Bergman made only with the greatest regret, is a very different (and much weaker film), cutting out much of the film's magical realism, the touching meditations on growing old represented by the character of the grandmother, and some vivid depictions of early 20th-century Sweden.",
