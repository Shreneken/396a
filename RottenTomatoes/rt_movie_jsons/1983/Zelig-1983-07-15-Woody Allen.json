    "summary": "In this fictional documentary, a man achieves notoriety for his ability to look and act like anyone he meets. With his unique talent for mimicry, Zelig (Woody Allen) ingratiates himself with people from every sector of society. His chameleon-like skill catches the eye of Eudora Fletcher (Mia Farrow), a doctor who thinks Zelig is in need of serious cognitive analysis. Their relationship moves in a direction that's not often covered in medical textbooks.",

            "content": "\"He was, of course, very amusing. But at the same time touched a nerve in people, perhaps in a way that they would prefer not to be touched.\"\nThough he wrote it for one of his characters, that's an oddly apt description of Woody Allen himself.\n\nAllen discards most of the neurotic intellectual persona that he used to such acclaim on his other work in order to create one of the most successful faux-documentaries that had been made to date. Using bluescreen technology, Allen and longtime cinematography collaborator Gordon Willis got very creative with the techniques that could convincingly edit old newsreel footage in the pre-digital era. With an eye towards lampooning the dry nature and even the practical design of traditional documentaries, the script gives plenty of short-form comedy to get the quick laughs. But as usual, there's also some creative subtext mixed in, as Zelig serves as a way for Allen to explore his own nervousness and social coping mechanisms, just taken to the extreme. \n\nZelig is definitely dated on the race jokes, which might make some people turn it off early, but for the world before Christopher Guest and This is Spinal Tap, the film is groundbreaking in the development of mockumentaries. Not as emotionally involving or consistent as some of Allen's other comedies, but definitely a creative departure featuring a lot of solid gags. (3.5/5)",

            "content": "Yes, a masterpiece. The entire premise of the movie is wildly original, even coming from WOODY ALLEN who continually cranks out one interesting film after another to this day. The label of mock-umentary just doesn't do justice to the uniqueness of this film. ALLEN and his amazingly talented staff created a movie that no other director could have made nor even thought of doing. Some of the humor is rather modern like the forward references to self-gratification during the psychiatrist scenes with MIA FARROW. But mostly, it's filled with humor from another time and place which we'll never return. To me, one of the wonderful aspects of this is the period music dispersed throughout with joyful admiration. We are lucky that ALLEN has continued to use music from the early part of the 20th century. I think no other director has so consistently had such a reverence for this wonderful music. Perhaps no other director has such a strong knowledge of it either. That WOODY ALLEN normally portrays himself as a nebbishy character in many of his own movies works so well in this movie. A more aggressive person who becomes a chameleon would not have worked as well at all. I am glad that MIA FARROW was still associated with him when he made this film, I think no other modern actress could have pulled this off as well as she did. She has that timeless look that is appealing but has a far-off feeling. The flavor of the period-looking cinematography and photography is part of the genius of the implementation here. It is so right on the money. The flickering of projectors, the out-of-focus look to so man scenes shot today meld amazingly well with the contrived shots. THINK ABOUT THIS - this is years before CGI took over Hollywood...years before FORREST GUMP and countless of other knock-offs have proliferated in movies. Gee whiz, there is CGI in so many movies these days. I watched a DVD of a recent movie recently which used special effects in the most unexpected, unlikely and unnecessary parts you'd be surprised. Yes, ZELIG is a masterpiece and I only feel sorry for those who cannot see the astounding piece of cinema this is.",

Allen is brilliant in the main role, and Mia Farrow is also perfect as the psychiatrist doing research on and trying to cure Zelig's exceptional ability to change character, which is a result of an intense identity disorder. The story is basically set to the 1920's, and this together with the superb old style filmography and special film and photo effects, takes the total up to a unique dimension of realism that almost makes one forget that it's only satire. Technically very realistic and most impressive for being made in the early 1980's. Also the actors playing the bi-characters are all doing such a credible job, without trying to be funny, which makes it all the more comical. In a myriad of priceless humoristic elements, there's also a general but subtle segment of serious psychology, both on the individual and universal human plan. It's so spot on that Charles Chaplin, who even has a small part as himself, would have been absolutely amused.",

            "content": "One of Woody Allen's most technically ambitious films this has a large a cult following and often ranks highly in critical assessments of Allen's entire filmography. In concept it is fascinating and it can be seen as a forerunner to films like Forrest Gump (1994) in the conceits that it employs and the comments that it makes on the nature of American society. I did find myself loving parts of the film but where it lost me was in the fact that we spend so much time viewing Zelig through the eyes of the intellectuals that narrate the pseudo documentary and not enough time with the characters at the center of the film. That meant that this was a difficult film to engage with emotionally and it lost something in it's refusal to let us into the character's mind.\n\nThe shy young man Leonard Zelig, Woody Allen, lied about having read Moby Dick to a group of people as a child and was able to assimilate successfully. From that moment on he was able to fit into any group he met, losing his own identity in the process. He becomes a media sensation as the public are fascinated by him but kind Doctor Eudora Fletcher, Mia Farrow, is eager to take him on as a patient and treat his condition. While treating him the two fall in love and eventually marry but women make unfounded claims against him which bankrupt him and the young couple struggle to survive.\n\nThe heart of the film should have come from the love story between Zelig and Fletcher who find themselves when they fall in love. Some of the best moments in the film come when Fletcher is simply questioning Zelig and an attraction between them slowly builds as the quiet Fletcher is charmed by Zelig's aggressive pursuit of her. Those who do not appreciate Allen's regular nebbish persona will be pleasantly surprised by his performance here as he is quiet and subdued without the joking of Alvy Singer. I could have used more of Allen in the film though as while there is novelty to hearing Susan Sontag spout absolute trash there should be more than just vague amusement to be drawn from imaginative nature of the film.",

Mia Farrow plays his psychiatrist.  Although Allen claimed that the content of the film (about conformity and needing to be liked, one supposes) was his main focus, the no-holds-barred effort to shoot the film using old cameras (and even to rough up the film stock), to create songs and other ephemera featuring Leonard Zelig the Chameleon that appear true to the period, to entice real people like Susan Sontag and Saul Bellow to reflect on the fictional Zelig, and most famously to super-impose Allen himself into stock footage featuring various celebrities and politicians of the era, suggest otherwise.  The whole thing flows very smoothly and you could, if your thoughts wandered for a moment, forget that you were watching a 1980s film (or at least forget that the footage of the past was faked).

I must admit, it's shot extremely well and he really looks like he's in some of the old footage, but the storyline is completely bonkers. It's about a human chameleon who seeks treatment for his weird condition. I really wondered what was going on while I was watching the film because it looked so real. The added commentary and interviews also made it seem really realistic but the storyline does go from one extreme to another. Watching Allen's character change into a Jew and a black person was cleverly done for a movie that was made in the 80's, but I was wondering what was Allen trying to attempt. It's shot like a documentary so there isn't much comedy but the concept is original but weird. I did stick with the movie because of the crazy storyline, but I don't know if I liked it or just thought that it was mad. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nPersonally I think that this movie would have been much better if he had some top class actors in it. The scene were Zelig was sitting behind Hitler trying to get his wife's attention was impressive and Allen played his character well. When all of his wife's started to pop out of the woodwork, the moral of the story comes into play but it's still a crazy movie. It's worth a watch just to witness Zelig change into different people and to see how he cleverly put the movie together. It does seem like your watching the History channel because of the old footage, but when you see Allen's face pop up in some of the shots, you realise that it's his warped sense of humour that created such a off the wall movie.\n\nBudget: N/A\nDomestic Gross: $12million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies about human chameleon, trying to to be cured of his condition. 5/10",

I don't think I ever saw another film like this.\n\nAn oldstyle comedic mockumentary on a fictional figure.\n\nWhat's better is the type of person this film is about: a human chameleon named Leonard Zelig, someone who can literally transform to match the people he is around to fit in. If he is around black people, his hair and skin will change. If he is around doctors, he will pose as one. When around anyone, he will fit in with them.\n\nIt came from when Zelig was younger and was asked if he's read Moby Dick. He was embarrassed to say no. He was humiliated and never wanted to feel like that again. So from then on, he's made sure he could always fit in with the crowd and not negatively stand out and potentially be humiliated.\n\nWith this story concept, Allen add hilarious lines all throughout the film.\nThis film is added to my list of favorite Woody Allen films.\n\nZelig, I give you a 100%.",

There's so much social and cultural critique to be mined for both smart comedy and introspective pathos: people's prejudices toward different races, the knowledge of one's own race as the Other, the oftentimes unquestioned authority of those in respected professions, et cetera. \n\nThe fictional Dr. Eudora Fletcher states that to the untrained observer, Zelig's faux-psychiatrist sounds realistic, but he's really just deploying cliched lingo. It would follow that Zelig adopts different stereotypical speech patterns for different races or classes, but all of this \"research\" is presented in silent \"archive footage,\" not some tour de force bit of spoof acting like Robert Downey Jr.'s in \"Tropic Thunder.\" Nothing changes within Woody or Zelig to actually BECOME or even inhabit another personality, which is sadly unsurprising since Woody Allen seems incapable of playing anyone other than Woody Allen. (And anyway, mimicking Dr. Fletcher is technically a plothole because Zelig's chameleonic power doesn't work with or on women.)\n\nWithout grounding in what it actually means to \"pass\" as a different race, class, or other distinction, this lightweight premise and execution is almost as insulting as Woody's blind man bit in \"Hollywood Ending.\"",

Like many other Woody Allen projects, Zelig is, as a whole, an underwhelming effort. This is truly one time that you could accuse Allen of choosing style over substance. Allen's strict adherence to the documentary structure, including authoritative narration, works to ultimately confine the work. All the humor and action is just moved along by the narrator, in order to setup and repeat one of the film's two jokes. The jokes surrounding this nothing man range from inserting him into old footage - He's behind Babe Ruth! He's behind Hitler - or him taking on the appearance of those around him - He's black! He's Asian! He's Scottish! The special effects used to believably insert Allen's Zelig in stock footage is impressive, but aren't really funny, let alone funny enough to carry the film.\n\nZelig marks Woody Allen's second attempt at the mockumentary, following his directorial debut, Take the Money and Run. The documentary structure is not as strictly adhered to in Take the Money and Run, which makes me wonder if Allen thinks that those breaks have a negative impact on the film. Allen does make statements concerning pop culture, celebrity, and himself as an artist and person, but I found them muddled in overall tone and structure of the film. Zelig, running at about 80 minutes, feels long and can never overcome the fact that it's a one joke film. I can only recommend it to die hard Woody Allen fans.",

When his medical malady is discovered, Dr. Eudora Fletcher (Mia Farrow) is determined to cure him of this strange syptom, but it's not going to be easy, especially when Zelig is exploited because of his symptoms and put in freak shows and put on a world tour, but after a tragedy, he's discovered at the Vatican and put in Fletcher's care, and she finds a way to cure him, and doctor and patient find themselves falling for each other. This brilliant piece of cinema, it took nearly 3 years to make, but it was worth it.

Yet, this does feel like a funny premise stretched to feature length.  As funny and smart as it is(as well as the underlying metaphor's incisiveness), it doesn't feel quite right all the time.  It might be better suited for a vignette or a short film, because the diversions with this idea often feel strained.",

I laughed out loud throughout, was impressed by the authentic feel of the mockumentary given that it is a humorous endeavour, and was astounded that a film from the 80s could be shot so that it looks like it was actually filmed in the 20s and 30s. Every other modern day film I've seen that tries to imitate that look never quite pulls it off completely, whereas with this it was pretty much impossible to distinguish between the vintage newsreel clips and the scenes that had been shot for the film. Brilliant stuff.",

Basically, this film pioneered the same concept and special effects later used to great effect and acclaim by Robert Zemeckis with Forrest Gump.\n\nThis film is a lot funnier, more clever, and more zany, though. Besides his antics with mimicking people and showing up at various historical events, Zelig becomes a celebrity in his own right, and, while being treated and cured by Dr. Eudora Fletcher, he falls in love. \n\nThis is a brisk, funny, very sweet, and terrific film. I loved the ideas and the execution. At a running time of 80 somehting minutes though, this feels really slight and the style seems to overrun the substance. The film does get slightly beneath the surface though, so it's not all fluff. It's not one of Woody's best, but I'd put it near the top of his B-Sides.",
