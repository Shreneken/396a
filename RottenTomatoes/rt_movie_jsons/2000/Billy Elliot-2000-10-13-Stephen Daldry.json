    "summary": "The life of 11-year-old Billy Elliot, a coal miner's son in Northern England, is forever changed one day when he stumbles upon a ballet class during his weekly boxing lesson. Before long, he finds himself in dance, demonstrating the kind of raw talent seldom seen by the class' exacting instructor, Mrs. Wilkinson. With a tart tongue and a never-ending stream of cigarettes in her hand, Mrs. Wilkinson's zest for teaching is revived when she sees Billy's potential.",

            "content": "I had heard of this film after finding out Jamie Bell won a BAFTA for this role. I didn't know about what would make him win for this film. After watching it, it made sense. His acting as a young adolescent was spot on and he brought a lot of musicality, but didn't get rid of his essence in finding his passion and determination. The story was simple, yet effectively conveyed about his passion for dancing and how with the toughest circumstances, he has shown that the impossible can be achieved. The supporting role of Julie Walters was also spot on, where the character performed a mentor relationship with the character Billy. Another highly recommended film to watch again in the future.",

BEST MOVIE EVER W O W W W W W WW . Billy was very hard working and deserved getting in a very good ballet dance team.",

It shows the process and developments that Billy elliot presented with in adapting to learn ballet. This movie presents the changes that Billy had experienced, and the struggles that he had faced in order to keep striving to achive his goal. He had the support from the sideline in order to move from one level to another. Overall this is good movie for veiwers that are interested in change and ballet and yup boci",

            "content": "This is by far the best classic movie made. Watching this movie I've had no regrets I enjoyed it so much I had to watch it twice. My honest opinion is I found it to be very classic as it's the original movie made so it wasn't too extra or crazy. This movie includes scenes with humor, drama, and some adult language.\n\n The name of the movie is called \u2018Billy Elliot' it is about a boy who does boxing once a week but finally finds his passion for ballet after some time. He then becomes better with the training and help of Mr. Wilkinson's\u2018 ballet teacher,' This movie was set in county Durham North East England. It was filmed in 1984 during the miner's strike rage. The main characters are Billy, Jackie, and Mrs. Wilkinson. This story is about a boy who becomes a ballet dancer after solving some misunderstandings/disagreements with his family. In my opinion ill say most actors did a good job because throughout the film although opinions were changed they were supporting Billy after they understood what he wanted. \n\nThroughout watching this movie I've had some scenes I really liked, one of them is towards the ending I don't wanna spoil anything. Another scene is how the father supported Billy. What I didn't like is how they didn't mention or explain to us how the mother passed.\n\nSome lesson I learned was to always be open with the people important to you especially when you don't know how they'll react because it's better if they heard it sooner than later. Some lessons people may take from the movie are to do what you want most and what you feel like you can do. Some quotes from the movie that I found had a lot of meaning are  \"Where you are born does not define your future\" and \"Don't let anything get in the way of you running after your dreams\".\n\nThis movie would be perfect for people who do ballet or don't do what they really want because they're scared of what might happen. Because of the inappropriate language in the movie I definitely wouldn't say it's good for young people but acceptable for the ages of 15 and above, so if you are under the age of 15 this movie wouldn't be recommended for you. The MPAA should be Mature Accompanied (MA 15+). Overall the movie is good because of the story and meaning behind it. 5/5",

            "content": "A movie that I thought wasn't too bad for such a kind of strange subject matter. Set in 1984 Billy Elliot is the tale of a young British boy that gets into ballet. Billy isn't exactly good at many things.\n\nAfter once again suffering at a boxing practice Jamie decides to stick around and take a ballet class. Soon enough dancing and ballet are all that is in Billy's head. He keeps it a secret from his father Jackie and older brother, but after his teacher, Mrs Wilkenson insists he tries out for the Royal Ballet School billy is torn between keeping the peace at home and fulfilling his dream. The movie has a plot that runs parallel to his father and dad on a strike from the local coal mine so tensions are high between the two of them throughout the film.\n\nBilly Elliot is a great little film that has a lot to say about what it means to be a man with some exceptional acting. Jamie Bell is brilliant and has one of the best child performances ever. Julie Walters is unbelievably likeable and gives a great performance. Gary Lewis (Jamie) also plays a very complex character who at the start you hate but by the end you just love. This is a very well-directed, well-written and entertaining film. There are very few problems and Billy's speech at the end is pure gold from the writers. There are also some good emotional moments. Billy Elliot is a great little film with a lot of heart\n\nI'd still argue that Billy Elliot is one of the best simple, heartwarming films out there. Billy Elliot is well-acted and both simple & complex. Everyone can relate to battling versus family and societal expectations on some level, and that makes the film powerful. Jamie Bell is just astonishing in Billy Elliot. The beauty of this film is its subtleties & performances, rather than the predictable story. Billy Elliot is visually absorbing and emotionally satisfying. A predictable, though unique & witty portrayal of a fun story. Billy Elliott superbly combines a real and raw working life piece of history together with a precise and beautiful art form. The language is direct and the humour is subtle but timed to perfection due to the emotional state of the movie. There's lots of great music and the dance side of the movie is told in an interesting way, non fans of the art like myself can definitely appreciate it. Despite the fact of the ballet scenes fall short of becoming more of a movie about tap dance, it is an interesting and well-acted movie that will entertain you with its emotional plot.\n\nI got to say that Billy Elliot is a passionate, and breathtaking movie!\" The performances in this movie are amazing! I just loved this inspiring & wonderfully uplifting film. I loved the gritty realness of life in blue-collar England, the sorrow of loss & the complicated emotions of crazy family life. So much was said in this small lovely film which was so well done. And thank God for subtitles.",

            "content": "Billy Elliot is a generous film in which a young boy discovers a passion to dance during the miner strike of 1984-85. The film potrays a young boy named Billy who grew up in North England. The director Steven Dauldry employs a range of techniques which enhances the films overall quality. One of the strategies he uses is music. Such as the song \"I was dancing when I was 12\" in which it helps the audience understand how you need to dance when you are younger and develop the talent. This film is an overall great watch for a mature audience as it does include swear words. I personally recommend this to an audience of 15years of age or above. It provides a great insight on life during the 80s and the hardships that people face.",
