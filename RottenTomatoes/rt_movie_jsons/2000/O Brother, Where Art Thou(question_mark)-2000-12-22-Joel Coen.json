Truly an Odyssey if there ever was one.",

The story was a little weak and boring at times, but the cinematography, comedy, characters and amazing music made it work phenomenally. It made me want to read the Odyssey, and it was just a great representation of old southern folk music. And of course considering the setting and source material, there was a major theme of religion. But unlike a lot of Christian movies, it used religion as a way for the characters to connect to their selves and their own morality instead of using religion as an end all, be all, or a way to demonize others. It actually critiques this idea, but in a way it's guilty of it as well. It elevates the story and the connection to the setting, a model of how religion should be used in film.  Loved this movie, it was an amazing time. Highly recommend.",

While it's not at the same level is its predecessors, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is certainly a well-executed and entertaining follow-up. When Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) escapes from a chain gang with fellow prisoners Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) and Pete (John Torturro), they embark on an episodic odyssey in search of spiritual salvation, personal redemption and, most importantly, a hidden treasure, at least according to Ulysses.  The film is filled with interesting characters, quirky events and some brilliant dialogue, with a sepia-tinged Mississippi as the backdrop.  While it may not be top-level Coen Brothers, it's certainly better than average and you can't go wrong with that.",

The first person the had meet that helped them was on the the criminals family members son he drove them away from the people after them and then they had meet with a guy playing a guitar that helps them make some money, then had also meet a guy who robbed banks and stole money, and then they meet a guy who robbed them of their money, they also had lost their friend Pete and they thought he had turned into a frog but in Pete was just caught by the people after them and the other two criminals decides to finish the road trip to find the treasure. The two of them ended up stopping in a town and one of them found his wife and 7 kids and the two boys went to see a movie and they saw their friend that was caught by the sheriff and they got their friend out of jail so now they are back to running from the sheriff. One of the boys went back to his old cabin that he had his family in cause he needed to find his ring for his wife and the sheriff was there waiting for the boys to arrive and they are going to hung for their crimes and they prayed to god cause he wanted to see his daughters and after this big waves of water came through and took them away with the water. They never found the right ring but they ended up living happy in the and free from work and they took back their bad habits for a new change cause they don't want to be away from their family anymore. In the end they all lived happy and free from working for most of their lives. The plot summary is that in the movie they are on a trip to find treasure but they have to go through some rough stuff to make it to the end they lost one of the three because he was caught by the people after the three of them and now they are trying to find the other two that have got away, they had met a guy that had taken all their money. All the people they have come across have seen them all in the future of the movie. The director films the way he does because it was way back in the day when things were very different. The directors tell the camera man to do certain shots to make an effect in the movie. The director works to make sure that the light crew has the lighting in the right spots so they have the effect they want in the movie. The director made it back when the great depression was because of people committing small crimes because people needed food and stuff. In the movie they have used medium and wide shots and they have used some others for effects of the movie. They have a shot in the movie where the camera guy slowly zooms in on one of the actors to make an effect. They used the sound effects where they should be like when the car broke down with the old old trucks like from the 80s and they had the radios from back in the day and what they sounded like. They have taken music for certain places in the movie like when the actors sang into a can for a guy to make money. The music was also from the 80s because it was filmed to be back in the day. The actors were very well picked for the movie and they do their job very well. The actors came based off of the odyssey like the one eyed monster was the guy that took all their money.",

They caught a barn on fire and picked up a black man on the road with a guitar. His name is Tommy and he claimed he sold his soul to the devil. They went to a recording studio to make ten dollars each. The three are wanted and have come very close to getting caught. They met up with George Nelson and robbed a bank. The record they sang went crazy. The whole state loved it. They steal a car and find a few girls in the river washing clothes and singing. Pete, one of the boys, goes missing after the fling with the woman and Delmar believes he got turned into a toad. They go to a restaurant and talk business with a one eyed man. The guy, Big Dan, beats them with a stick and steals their money. They got a ride with a hay truck and passed some slaves. Everette believes he might have seen Pete but then thinks the heat is getting to him. Everette found his wife and kids and his wife \"divorced\" him. \n\nThey went to a movie and the farm brought in the prisoners, Pete was one of them. Everett and Delmar broke Pete out of prison. Pete tells them that he told the prison guards that they were going to the treasure. And Everette tells them there was no treasure in the first place. They got in a fight then stumbled across the KKK. The KKK has their friend Tommy and the three boys are trying to save him before he gets hanged. They dressed up as a member of the KKK and saved him. The three boys and Tommy got on stage and sang their hit that everybody liked and Everett thinks he can get his wife back. They then sang \"You Are My Sunshine\" with Pappy O' Dan. They go to their cabin. The guy with the hound is there and they have ropes to hang the three guys. He had a few prisoners to dig their graves. Just as they were going to hang the three, a huge wave of water came through and wiped everything out. Everette got back with his wife but she got mad when he got the wrong ring.\nCamera angles/shots\nBlack and white, a lot of close up and medium shots. Slow move in from a medium shot to close up. Lots of wide shots of the fields. Some over the shoulder shots. The guy that is chasing them had fire in his glasses all the time to represent being the devil.\nDirector\nThe Coen brothers are the directors. It's very easy to follow and the timing is about right. It's in the depressed state of the country so you can tell times are tough. They also put time related things in the movie such as KKK, and how not many people like the blacks.\nLighting, sound, and music\nFilmed in a brownish color to make it look like the 150s, and 1960s. A lot of older music to make it seem like the 50s. All the people are wearing clothes that were from the 50s. They put the glow of the fire as reflection so it looks realistic.\nActors\nVery believable. If it was real life I would definitely think they were prison escapees. They also do a good job on how they make it seem like they don't have a very good education.",

Robbing banks with a man named George nelson. The three men sang a song that went very popular through the whole state now making more people chase these three men. One of the three boys  goes missing after they stopped for three women on the water.a one eyed man stops the two boys and makes them pack up their food just to make money by selling bibles. The one eyed man lied and knocked them both out stealing all of their cash. The one man that went missing got captured by the man that's been trying to arrest the three men for their whole trip.\n\n\nPlot description- The two boys found peet back to being a prisoner going back to hard labor. Everette went to a city and found his six kids but his wife told his kids that he got hit by a train then she remarried. The 2 boys broke peet out of jail again at night. Peet admits that he told the guard where the treasure was, then Everette admits that there was no treasure. The three boys come up on a kkk meet. The three boys steal kkk uniforms to save their friends from getting hung. They successfully save their friend while destroying the kkk meat dropping the burning cross. The 4 boys go to a show and play their song that went famous across the state cheering the whole crowd up. The kkk leader tries to intervene and ruin their show but fails, gets booed then gets kicked out. They come by George Nelson again with a whole crowd carrying him somewhere. The man that's been hunting them gets to the three boys not expecting the extra man preparing to hang them. Water crashes down right before they were going to get hung after Everette prayed that he just wants to see his daughter again then a massive flash flood. At the end the three girls were attached by a rope referencing the time where the boys were in jail all chained together. \n\nConan brothers- I don't think I could critique the director all that much because the actors were well casted the songs were good for the time, the way they dressed was accurate even the way Everette gelled his hair was good for the time so I think all around it was an amazing movie. \nExamples \n\nShots and lighting- Used lots of darker colors to give an old time feel. Even the way at night how the flame when they get hunted feels and lights up the surroundings in a good way. They use lots of medium shots and are amazing. They also use a good amount of close ups at the right time. They use over the shoulder shots when they speak. The man that hunts them always has a flame in his glasses representing the devil in the movie.",

The soundtrack, cinematography, and general atmosphere of the Depression-era South grips from the first scene and never relinquishes. The story arc manages the impressive feat of provoking both feelings of satisfaction and dissatisfaction after running its course through its fun-filled subversions and winding path through one stellar scene after another. Clooney, Turturro, and Nelson are an enjoyable trio but the film really find its strength in strong supporters. Big Pappy, Sherriff Cooley, and Baby-Face Nelson are only three of a pool of marvelous characters also including Holly Hunter as Clooney's estranged wife and King as a devil-dealing musician that are predominantly acted with a special amount of enthusiasm by the cast. Of course credit must go to the inspirational Odyssey in this case, but the Coens advance a step further by offering up a clear stamp of their own style while only loosely sticking to the classic.",

            "content": "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?: The Drama and the Joy of living.\nThis week I'll be looking at the classic southern comedy Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? Released in 2000 and Written, Directed, Produced and Edited by the Coen Brothers it features a stellar cast including George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman and Holly Hunter. The film follows three men, Ulysses, Pete and Delmar, who escape from a chain gang and set off across the wide fields of Mississippi in search of a hidden treasure. The thing that struck me most about this movie is how it achieved a sense of life and action and journey without dwelling on the typical tropes that fill a normal travel film. Instead, it whisks it's protagonists past fires, robberies, recording contracts and KKK rituals with reckless abandon. The enjoyment of dramatic comedies like this one often lie in the hearts and emotions of its ridiculous and lovable characters and the simplicity yet insanity of their plots rather than cooking up a complex or thought provoking narrative. Oh, Brother Where Art Thou? Is an excellent example of this formula. The events of the film are fantastical, stylized and unbelievable at best but that is definitely the point. The story is more a fable then it is a cohesive story and the way the film is presented leans all the way and more into its unbelievability. The thing about this film is that nothing was quite weighty, nothing was quite serious and no plot point was dwelled on for very long. Sure there were instances of foreshadowing, plot twists and high stakes but the film can't escape the feeling that it's wandering around aimlessly with no clear plan. Rather like its main characters. The thing is that every point I've made about this movie is the point the Coen brothers wanted to create when developing it. Thus the film thrives in its own right even with those narrative oddities. Oh Brother is a film that works not necessarily because of what it shows, but how it shows it. The film is simply a joy to take part in and a pleasure to watch. It's not philosophical and it's not even like real lifeyet the film practically leaps and jumps for the joy of life itself. Three men on the road, taking things as they come and seeking their fortunes while stopping to enjoy the scenery around them. Going through ridiculous and dire circumstances together and living a life far from reality but somehow close to the heart. In short, it's pure entertainment. Oh Brother Where Art Thou? Is a spectacle; a preposterous and hilarious experience that may not leave you thinking but will definitely leave you smiling. The Coens bring us into a world of stylized fantasy, colorful characters and steadfast brotherhood that paints a picture without much food for thought but that is masterful at entertaining us with its charms.\nThe thing I found most impressive about this movie is how it uses very clever tricks to immerse the audience in the world it creates. Now using the word \"world\" might be a little strange because this movie takes place in plain old Mississippi. There's nothing strange or otherworldly about 1937 rural America or is there? At the start, the film teases us into thinking it's serious by showing us a very real scene: A chain gang working on the railway tracks and singing a spiritual. Then it reveals itself in its true colors as it introduces its main characters prancing through a tobacco field while the whimsical folk tune \"big rock candy mountains\" plays. From the get go the chief thing that makes the film so immersive is the quality and authenticity of its soundtrack. Every time the country music plays it elevates the film into a whimsical stratosphere and breathes life and color into every scene. The storytelling relies heavily on the soundtrack and this would be a definite problem for the film if the music wasn't so darn good. That's not all the film presents to tell its story. The Coens hit us with an original one two punch by the films unique color palette. Many people have talked about the significance of Oh Brother's yellow, sepia-tinted look as the first time digital color correction was used for an entire film and how that was because it was shot in spring and the Coens wanted an autumnal look and huge respect to Roger Deakins and his team for pulling that off but the thing I want to focus on here is how that change in color makes Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? So much better from a narrative standpoint. The subtle, sepia-tinted look of the film puts the audience back into the 1930's more effectively then making the film in black in white would have because that color evokes not the films of that period but the pictures of that period. It puts its color palette into a time period that never existed and in so doing sets the film apart from connection to down to earth reality. And very far from reality it is. The Coens based the story on Homer's Odyssey and that poem is a rather epic and mythical one to adapt to 1937 Mississippi. They achieve this by presenting each preposterous scenario and character casually as if such things and people happen every day. They also present their three main protagonists as acceptant to such oddities as a soul selling guitarist, a bible salesman with an eye patch, one of their number being turned into a toad and hundreds of people singing in white robes on their way to be baptized. They also structure the story so full of chance encounters, unexplained conveniences and Ex Machinas that the viewer finally abandons trying to make sense of the movie and starts to focus on more important things. The film really takes you into its world and even provides you with a great place to be.\nWhile the film saunters along with no clear message or point that it's trying to convey, it sneaks a message of friendship and life just out of sight of face value. The core and heartbeat of the movie lies within the character, interaction and relationship of the three main characters: Ulysses, Pete and Delmar. Even though they lie to each other, get angry with each other and are forced to escape together out of necessity and initially stay together because of false promises, a bond forms between them (and Tommy) so that by the end they stick up for each other through the thick of it and work together to achieve Ulysses' actual goal. This particular type of friendship is what one might call the friendship of experience. As time passes and the trio experience more and more crazy things together; rob together, sing together, travel together and brush with death multiple times together they develop a connection that shared experience makes and particularly life on the lam. Closely connected to that message is the theme of journey. That might seem obvious, I mean the film is a road trip movie through and through but it conveys in its own whimsical and wild way all the trials, hardships good times and bad times that come by getting from point A to point B and the change that occurs because of it. With the films mythical southern tall tale feel it's able to show so much in just a couple of days in its time and only 100 minutes of film. As they wander through the wide Mississippi plains they encounter incident after incident but with each misadventure band closer together. Reaching a goal requires journey and Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? Dwells on the trip rather than the goal and feasts on the drama and the laughs that come from it.\nGood character is always the most important element in a narrative and in this film the characters (especially the main three) are truly the heartbeat that drives the film forward and provides the core of the life that reverberates from it. From humor to heart to conflict and conversation Ulysses, Pete and Delmar provide the exaggerated banter a comedy often has balanced with the real human interactions that would occur between three such people in their situation in the quieter moments. Though the film may deter briefly from them or seem to focus more in on the people and places they go, they're always at the center and their interaction between themselves and the world around them is more than just the focus of the story, it's the heart of the story. The title of the film seems ambiguous. The Coens based the title as a reference to the Preston Sturges' 1941 film Sullivan's Travels where a director seeks to make a film from the fictional great depression era book called Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? And if there is an intentional significance to the phrase in regards to the film the brothers have never specifically stated. However the question can apply in an indirect way to the relational nature of the film. I see the title as an overall question that the narrative asks with brother used in the more biblical sense as brethren or friend. The way I see it another way to phrase the question is \"where is a friend that I can confide in and how can I find him?\" each person in the story is looking for a companion. Many are looking for their own selfish reasons but every person Ulysses, Pete and Delmar encounter draw them in with amicable gestures. The film tracks its three main characters as they seek to find where their brothers are. Whether between themselves or the people they meet. Though comedic and light in tone the movie still has a message of true friendship that is brilliantly portrayed by the three main characters; the words they speak and the actors who portray them. The film, in a very lively and tongue in cheek way creates a landscape of characters and their relationships and interactions that truly define it. It even slyly hides a connection to that fact in its odd and seemingly unrelated title.\nOh Brother, Where Art Thou? Is a madcap blend of buddy comedy, road trip movie, southern adventure and mythical fairy tale. The story is delirious and fabled and the film revels in that fact providing scenarios and characters that are over the top and hilarious yet never unbelievable, forced or unentertaining. The incredible soundtrack, wide open locations and amazing cinematography perfectly compliment the whimsical and wandering story. The film is made by its clever dialogue, amazing music and wonderful characters that work not because they're believable but because they entertain and immerse. The world it provides is one of life; full and bubbling over with the joy and drama that is being free and alive. Oh Brother, Where Art Thou is a showcase of how cinema can be great by the adeptness of how it tells a story rather than the complexity or philosophy of the plot. It also proves that the main goal of film is to draw in the viewer and move them to emotion and it does just that in its own unique, clever, musical and brilliant way.",

            "content": "Whimsical humor among a folk odyssey wherein George Clooney steals the show.\n\nJoel Coen's direction for his crime-comedy, musical adventure O Brother, Where Art Thou (2000) is very pleasant in atmosphere, but never really keeps the laughs coming. The entire movie is delightful, but I wasn't laughing hard like the other Coen pictures, nor was I exactly moved by the dramatic scenes very much. I enjoyed T. Bone Burnett's folk music soundtrack the most. Not all these country folk songs are as inspired as the others, but I found them all fun as they're very goofy. I recommend O Brother, Where Art Thou? for die-hard Coen enthusiasts, but it's not comparable to how funny Fargo or The Big Lebowski are, let alone the serious drama that falls short of Miller's Crossing or even Blood Simple.\n\nGeorge Clooney is the reason to watch O Brother, Where Art Thou? Because his fast talking, hair slicked back convict on the run named Ulysses Everett McGill is a riot. His silly Southern accent and good natured humor is just so pleasant to watch. I really love Clooney at his most whimsical. John Turturro is the short tempered idiotic convict on the run with Clooney named Pete Hogwallop. His idiocy is a nice foil for Clooney's suave and commanding presence. Tim Blake Nelson plays the biggest dumbo on planet Earth named Delmar O'Donnell and he's delightfully dimwitted. Nelson is a fun pairing with Clooney as they just get along swell.\n\nChris Thomas King is excellent as travelling blues guitarist Tommy Johnson, who the guys pick up for the adventure at a crossroads after Johnson sold his soul to the devil. It's just like Robert Johnson and Tommy Johnson's real life claim and I think he's an excellent addition to the gang. Holly Hunter is great as Clooney's stubborn ex-wife Penny, but she needed more screen time and jokes. She's only in the last few minutes or so. Charles Durning's opportunist governor and Ray McKinnon's goofy new suitor to Hunter are fun side characters. Everyone else is serviceable, but not as memorable as other Coen Brothers' supporting actors.\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen's writing is generally pretty clever for these 3 idiots escaping a chain gang. It's a neat concept to adapt Homer's classic epic The Odyssey in the deep South as a journey between 3 friends. I don't think they do too much with that concept other than representing each character as some form of somebody from The Odyssey like John Goodman's genial and hulking bible salesman representing the Cyclops, encountering seductive sirens, or the blind gentleman being the prophet. Rather, I think the comradery and antics between the triple leads is what sets O Brother apart from the other Coen movie as they are each uniquely lovable morons. Whether they quarrel with the Klu Klux Klan or play folk music for the radio, you are attuned to these stupid fellows no matter where their journey takes them.\n\nJoel Coen, Ethan Coen, and Tricia Cooke's editing is probably the biggest complaint I have as O Brother is only 107 minutes, but feels twice that length. Everything moves so slowly like an old Western instead of the modern comedy it is actually. I appreciate The Coen's nods to old cinema like Preston Sturges' Sullivan's Travels being the origins of the movie's title, but it should be paced quicker for such a silly movie. Roger Deakins' cinematography looks nice with pretty sepia tones and striking wide shots. Deakins is always creative in how he shoots films with fun and fresh style.\n\nMary Zophres and Cha Blevins' costumes look neat with an old timey warmth and simplicity. Jean Ann Black's make-up is great as every guy is covered in mud and dirt for that gritty feel. Dennis Grassner and Nancy Haigh's production design and set decoration, respectively, comes up with a wretched look for every place the boys visit. It sure looks like Mississippi.\n\nIn all, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is merely a very fine and thoroughly enjoyable movie, but not quite a great picture like The Coen Brothers' previous films.",

As if they were putting the movie together and just threw together a bunch of random scenes. And some have complained about the Coens making light of racism and the Klan. \nThe Coen brothers don't do anything randomly. Every detail in their films is meticulously planned out. Much like Hitchcock, the movie is essentially done when the storyboard is complete.\nAs to making light of racism and the Klan, the three protagonists save Tommy the black guitar player, and they show the Klansmen for the fools that they are.\nThis film is unique, hilarious, and nostalgic. The 1930's Mississippi setting  is perfect. The performances of Clooney, Tuturro, and Nelson are comically exaggerated---exactly as they should be. And don't overlook Durning, Goodman, Hunter, and the others. There's a palpable feeling that the actors were having a ball making this film.\nThere are scenes here that will stay in your head forever: the baptism scene, the siren scene, the Klan scene. \nI can't think of a more entertaining movie. Magnificent work by the top auteurs of postmodern filmmaking. \nAnd the soundtrack is priceless. Looking at the concert scene toward the end, you could say that there's a message here about the healing power of music.",

            "content": "This might just be The Coens' most playful movie. It's exhilaratingly fun to watch, hyperactive in its madness and highly expressionistic in its form. Right in the middle of their careers, when they were beginning to grow up and but still had their early infectious energy, the Coens craft this loose adaptation of Homer's Odyssey. O Brother, Where Art Thou? centers around George Clooney's Everett Ulysses (ahem) McGill, a 1930's Southern American bum with the gift of talking as he escapes his hard-labor sentence with his two trusty, not so bright, sidekicks, played by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson.\n\nIn their journey through the beautifully coloured plains of America they encounter numerous quirky characters, each one funnier than the previous, running from a deliciously one-sided villain reminiscent of the antagonist in Cool Hand Luke. Never has been The Great Depression showed as being so wacky, creative and fable-like and this is not only owed to the Coens but also to Roger Deakins' spectacular cinematography. He can truly shoot any genre and any style and make it look effortless and masterful.\n\nDespite the film's richness in symbolism and tongue-in-cheek, non-judgemental social commentary, some might say that it's not as heavy-hitting as the Coens' more serious works, and they might be right, but this does not come from a lack of substance, but from the choice of a simple form for the movie, a purely linear form fitting for a universal tale of coincidence and justice, a parable as old as time, as relevant now as it was when it was written.",

The bit at the beginning of the film where it tells you that the story is based on The Odyssey probably made people afraid to dislike this film since it's based on a literary classic.  Those same people probably think this film is \"smart\" for the same reason.  Thankfully I'm not as gullible as the average idiot.  I didn't laugh or chuckle even once during this abject failure of a film and neither did any of the people I watched it with.  I forced myself to watch this horrid, dull, piece of cinematic feces through to the end.

            "content": "O Brother Where Art Thou tells the story of Everett, Pete and Delmar three members of a Mississippi prison chain gang who embark on a quest to gain their freedom and pursue money and glory. Taking place during the 1930s and the depression era the plot situated on the trios search for a lost treasure, which later turns out to be an idea and not just gold. Along the way there is conflict between the characters as their own interests come in between the central goal that they have. Meanwhile Sheriff Cooley is on the trail to pursue our heroes and they most use the eccentric and downright detestable at times characters that they meet along the way to move on in their quest. The allusion throughout the film borrows from Homer's The Odyssey as the main character Everett's middle name is Ulysses which is Odysseus in Greek. The whole film fits in the archetype of the quest of the quest as they as characters like Everett are looking to restore their marriage, and Delmar and Pete are looking for recognition security and their freedom. The treasure symbolically is being accepted and gaining their freedom. We see more allusions to the Odyssey with one-eyed Big Dan as the Cyclops, the three girls by the river as the Sirens, Sheriff Cole as the villain, Everett's wife marrying someone else when he comes home and the Baptism at the water just to name a few. One of the more intriguing elements was the blind man on the hand-pumped railway that tells the companions that they would not find the treasure they seeked, which mirrors the prophet that Odysseus consults in the underworld. I found the largest foreshadow in the song that played at the beginning of the film and then throughout called \"The Man of Constant Sorrow\", which was directly foretelling of the character Odysseus whose name means \"man who is constant pain and sorrow.\" It was very interesting to see film and famous literature intersect at such a complex level and all of this is easy to miss if you do not pay attention or have not read Homer. The Resolution of the film was fulfilling as the three heroes are pardoned and then survive a flood when the dam breaks. Everyone is left off in better suits and it mirrors the conclusion of the Odyssey. This was an entertaining film that was witty, funny and enthralling and one I would watch again just for the soundtrack alone. The archetype of the quest is clearly present as they are searching to restore and bring back the old within their lives and to renew what was lost from before and it may also fit into the archetype of the journey as well.",

            "content": "The Coen brothers style of comedy is certainly an acquired taste. I tend to be somewhat frustrated with movies like this where it seems like no one is normal, everyone is either a complete moron or they are a cartoon-like stereotype. I think in O Brother this works better because it all has a mythological feel since they are trying to recreate stories from the Odyssey, but I still wish it was grounded in a reality instead of this stylized variation of the real world. The other issue with the way they recreate the myths is that the entire film feels episodic. It doesn't have a good flow from one scene to the next, because 2 back-to-back events are sometimes completely unrelated. Yet there are a fair share of these events that I find funny, and I did laugh out loud more than once at this movie even though I've seen it a couple of times.\n\nWhile the story structure doesn't work for me there are two aspects of O Brother that I find delightful. First of all there is the music. It is a bit cheap when they make it so clear that the actors themselves are not singing, but I'm a big fan of this style of old-fashioned Southern music. I find myself humming the tunes for hours after watching the movie, and the way they integrate music into scenes that range from baptisms to Klan meetings is great. The singing isn't merely a tool used in the plot, but it sets the tone for many scenes perfectly. Most importantly there is the cast. Clooney can be a bit over-the-top with his character, but somehow he makes that work for humorous effect. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are great as his cohorts. They are simultaneously dumb as a bag of rocks, and lovable. My other favorite performance in the film is Charles Durning as the incumbent governor of Mississippi. His interactions with his advisers and the turn his campaign takes at the end are all played brilliantly. There's a lot to like in O Brother, Where Art Thou and frankly I'd be happy to watch it again for those aspects. However, since the story structure doesn't hold together as cohesively as I'd like it's not one that I'll seek out.",

Not as good as many think, but its a good-humoured, excellent looking, well-designed period piece which takes the template of the Odyssey and plays it for laughs without glossing over the danger and darkness of the deep south at the time.  The three leads are terrific, especially Tim Blake Nelson, who's performance one could derive great pleasure and enjoyment from (the movie is quotable).  The supporting characters are mostly memorable, from Charles Durning's really funny turn as the rotund incumbent Governor of Mississippi (surrounded by even more rotund advisors) to John Goodman's dastardly, Cyclopean bible salesman, to a welcome appearance by Daniel Van Bargen, a longtime favorite of mine, as one of those creepy southern cops who might be old scratch himself.\n\nIts not a perfect movie.  At times it is made with too light a touch, and little of the humour is of the belly laugh variety.  I maintain the Coen Brothers are confectioneers who, while undoubtedly clever and original, tend in most of their films to dance along the surface rather than hitting you in the gut on either a comedic or dramatic level.   The weakest element to me is the Holly Hunter character.  She is played well, but is really annoying, which is a problem because as with the Odyssey the driving force of the journey is the central hero's need to return to his wife.  But who would risk their life to return to this prissy, materialistic caricature?  I found the whole wedding ring scene cringe-worthy and very reminiscent of Portia's lengthy jewelry inquisition in \"Merchant of Venice\".  This is much less of a problem here, because she's a bit character rather than the central heroine.  But it is a problem due to the thrust of the story.\n\nWith the problems out of the way, this is a nice little movie, well acted with terrific dialogue and quite pleasing visually and aurally.  Speaking of the latter, there is some terrific music, which itself is enough reason to see the movie/buy the soundtrack.  Better yet, some of the best music is mixed with the comedy, which as I said isn't uproarious but is consistently chuckle-worthy.  So not a great movie but very good in many different ways.",

The script is also very funny and makes you feel for the main characters. The film is not perfect however and there are a few problems. One problem is that I thought the film got a little slow at some points. Another problem is that I would've liked for there to have been some more character development besides Clooney's character.

Led by George Clooney as Everett, John Turturro as Pete, and Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar, this movie often makes comedy out of seemingly awful situations.  These situations include lynching, getting beaten up by a man representing the cyclops (John Goodman), almost getting hung, etc.  As the leader of the pack, Everett journeys with his companions to search for a supposed treasure, which will make him rich and available to his wife (Holly Hunter).  The story is highlighted by the fact music could be a solution to Everett, Delmar, and Pete's problems with the law and with their families.  No spoilers here though.  Also going on is a political campaign where Governor Pappy O'Daniel's incumbency is threatened by an opponent (Wayne Duvall) who seems to be an appealing everyman.  Charles Durning does a fantastic job in this supporting role being cantankerous and hypocritical.  As with many things in this film, it comes across as hilarious.  The real stars are Clooney, Turturro, and Blake Nelson though and their plight will keep you engaged for the most part.  This film falls short a little in the pacing department, but it isn't too bad.  Not what I would consider the Coen Brothers' best, but a very stellar flick nevertheless.",

Along the way, they meet some others inspired by monsters and creatures from The Odyssey.\nExcellent movie. I wouldn't say it captured The Odyssey perfectly but it was an interesting and fun movie and it definitely captured the 30s vibe, especially musically, well. Another success for the Coens.",

            "content": "The Coen brothers like to be trendy and I don't blame people for hating them just for that (cause I'm a bad person).  I, however, feel that there's often more to their films than just an image; made up from a showbiz cast, a good soundtrack, and a story gimmick of some sort. I think that there's sometimes a charm in there too that gives some substance to go with the style and , for me, that's what takes one of  their films from something that I don't care about, to something that I do. It's been a mixed bag overall but- I sure as hell care about this one.\n\nThis is my favourite Coen brother's movie which is somewhat ironic considering it's probably the one most associated with trying to be hip- its got the image (the first film to be colour-enhanced in the way that it was), the setting (Old Timey Mississippi), \nthe showbiz (Clooney, of course), the soundtrack (IT'S FANTASTIC) and the gimmick. (Homer's Odyssey, but really not. Like, really not...) None of these things have to be bad though- I like them all in this case, but it doesn't change the fact that this is the one that you'll likely think of when you're asked to name a Coen brother's film that lacks depth but succeeds due to the other elements anyway.\n\nIndeed, it does lack depth- the characters are simplistic, some scenes feel tacked on and there for cheap laughs (which this film has a lot of), and its humour is simple- often leaving this one to be seen as a 'teen movie' with ridiculous tags like that found all over the place in reference to this film.\n\nHowever, I see these issues as minor, even beneficial in some cases, as we're talking about a comedy here and the lack of sophistication in certain areas plays right into that. I do disagree altogether with the claim that this is a film solely worth merit based on how you respond to its attempts at comedy. I find the film funny, and I'm certainly no fan of so-called 'teen movies' so let's put that claim to rest, but the humour is simplistic- a running gag is Clooney's character using the catchphrase \"we're in a tight spot now\" repeatedly... that's it. I enjoy such things (this is actually my favourite of Clooney's films) but I'm sure that others sure as hell will not. \n\nI think there's more to the film that its comedy though and that's why I take issue with some of the criticisms that have been aimed at it- indeed, the film lacks depth but it doesn't lack emotion. It does a fantastic job at using music to create atmosphere, which is nothing new of course, but to hear outstanding blues tracks like 'Hard Time Killin' Floor Blues' along with plenty of great folk pieces (even the very dark 'O death') glued into a slapstick comedy film is a brilliant experience- this film deserves the reputation that it has with regards to its soundtrack.\n\nThe music furthers the feel of the film too, as does its striking visuals- while it never takes itself seriously, it deals with serious themes in as un-serious a form as it can- leaving the music and setting to add the emotion while the film keeps us happy and interested.\n\nIt surely is interesting too- it's a great example of a madcap story that's full of adventure and unpredictable and unexpected events with lots of fascinating and engaging characters along the way. These characters may not be well-developed but they're all well-introduced and the execution is great too with the likes of John Goodman and Holly Hunter involved.\n\nThe performances are strong all round and the accents work too- despite how ridiculous the film is, it feels genuine, not just in its attempts at humour, but also in the; arguably more important, ideas of capturing the setting and telling the story. To anyone who isn't out to hate it from the start, this film doesn't feel empty and is clearly a labour of love.\n\nFor me, this is most comparable with 'Raising Arizona'- another quirky, interesting, and exciting work by the Coen brothers but this one feels more comfortable- there's a confidence in how it tells its story and puts itself forward and I think that's what has made it so successful. A film like this shouldn't be as cool as it is, or as mainstream and successful- it's as simple as that, but it's so superbly-executed and clearly cared for that it managed to become a real piece of pop culture and I think its perfect blend of comedy with its minor touches of emotion, is what led to that happening and it's well-deserved.",

            "content": "This is the third time I've tried to write this review and by this point I'm fucking pissed.  I'm gonna try to keep this review as concise as I possibly can, but I really doubt I will, so bear with me.  This is an excellent movie, and it's typical Coens, but it's certainly not their best.  I've not seen The Ladykillers or Intolerable Cruelty, so I can only talk about the films that I HAVE seen.  I find their \"worst\" film to be Burn After Reading.  But, to be fair, the Coens' worst film would be Brett Ratner's best film, for example.  Just to throw a name out there, not that I have anything against Brett Ratner.  What I appreciate about the Coens' films is how they're able to adapt and evolve with each film they make.  Their career, as with that of many great filmmakers, certainly has constants.  Like their oddball characters, for example, and their dialogue.  They have a very specific way of writing dialogue, which I can't exactly describe, but you still know it's one of their films from the way the characters talk and behave.  So those two  are certainly one of their constants, but they apply these elements differently with each film they make.  They're simply not content with just making the same movie over and over again with different names for the characters, like Wes Anderson.  They adapt to what each film requires of them, and that's one of their very obvious strong points.  And they've been doing this for 30 years, at least on a high level since I'm counting from Blood Simple's release.  I'm sure they've been working on their craft for even longer than that, Blood Simple was just the film that brought them to the forefront.  The fact of the matter is that, anyone who's involved in a business where you create your own stories and you direct them as well, there's bound to be some stagnation at some point.  You could say that stagnation came with The Ladykillers or Intolerable Cruelty which, again, I haven't seen, so I'm basing it on what people have said.  But, for all intents and purposes, the Coens have managed to produce consistently great movies and manage to remain relevant in a business that changes every year.  They've managed to do this for 30 years straight.  And yea, people like Scorsese and Spielberg have been doing it for longer, and though I don't doubt that they're very much involved in the creative process, the fact of the matter is they don't write most of their own scripts.  Don't get me wrong, I love Scorsese and Spielberg, and I'm sure they're involved in the creative process regardless of whether or not they're credited for it.  Sometimes script changes on set, and the director has to oversee that, so I don't doubt that they work hard.  They probably work even harder considering the fact the projects they're involved in usually are high-budgeted with a large cast whereas the Coens do films closer to indies with a smaller budget and a smaller cast.  But it's different when, every film you've ever directed you've also written.  You're involved in the creative process from beginning to end, you don't come in at the middle or even a quarter of the way in.  The fact that the Coens have managed to adapt and evolve, as I mentioned, makes me have the utmost respect for them because they know they have to stay ahead of the curve and the quality of their films reflect that.  But that's enough kissing of the Coens' asses.  On to this film.  Like I said, it's certainly not their best, but it is a pretty damn great film regardless.  One of the things that I'll say, and probably the only time I'll ever compare it to one of the Coens' previous films, is that I found that, much like The Big Lebowski, this film didn't have much of a story.  It wasn't certainly focused on as much as a No Country for Old Men for example.  This more about Delmar's, Everett's and Pete's journey and not the destination.  Because of that, I don't think the story to be as tightly woven as some other films in their filmography.  But the fact that the cast is so great, George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro have excellent chemistry, and the script is simply so damn good, on top of that you have the great cinematography, which has a great sepia-tinted look to give it that dirty feel certainly make up for the fact that the narrative is a little lacking.  Not to mention the great soundtrack, which certainly makes watching the film that much easier.  There's also a hint of surrealism in this film, like the Coens have done in the past.  The trio will be in the forest during their escape/adventure, and all of a sudden they'll come a group of people singing in the forest on their way to the lake, or when they come across the women singing while bathing at the lake or when they come across a klan rally.  Two of these groups acknowledge the trio, but one of them doesn't even acknowledge them, which adds to the surrealism.  Those aspects of the film, again, aren't as focused on but they are there and that's another Coen trademark.  I will say that I found the way the story wrapped up, with everything being solved perfectly, to be a little too \"mainstream\" and unlike the Coens, but I didn't have that much of a problem with it...but it is noticeable if you've followed their careers.  With that said, and I'd have to go back at the films I've seen to see where this ranks up, but this isn't their best...so don't go in expecting it to be.  But that doesn't mean this film isn't excellently written, funny, beautifully shot and with a tremendous cast.  I definitely recommend this film even if you're not a fan of the Coens, there's still a lot to enjoy here.",

O Brother has an interesting and satirical look on American culture in the late '30s, such as crime, music, radio, and the law, giving audiences something to laugh at.  The Coen brothers do a great job writing and directing this clever comedy, along with other thanks to the actors involved with the production, including George Clooney as Everett (the bright one), John Turturro as Pete (the weak  one), and Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar (the dumb one).  The film also has great production design, costume design, cinematography, and great editing.  O Brother has lots of laughs and music, my most favorite song being \"Constant Sorrow\" by Dick Burnett (song was published in 1913).  Composer T-Bone Burnett also helps with the film's music.

This may not be the favorite of many folks out there, but I truly feel that everyone would benefit to watch this movie again with the perspectives of noticing the links to Homer and seeing the application of ancient ideas to our worlds today. There has been no script more clever in my movie watching existence, nor one more deftly constructed. My one and only critique of the movie is that if you miss the two quick early references to the dam breaking, much of the point of the last scene is entirely missed.

            "content": "I had wanted to see this film for a long time, but never got the proper chance to see this film. Ever since I was a kid, I remember hearing \"Man of Constant Sorrow\" on the radio, and after finding out where the song came from, which was O Brother, Where Art Thou, I've wanted to watch it ever since. Last night, I got the chance to watch it on AMC, and having low expectations, I ended up enjoying this film. And I mean, really enjoying it.\r\n\r\nIn this Appalachian version of Homer's The Odyssey, three men, Everett Ulysses McGill (George Clooney), Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), and Pete (John Turturro), escape from a prison farm during the Depression in the Deep South. McGill had stolen some treasure and buried it before going to prison, and wants to reclaim the treasure with his friends. Along the way, the three encounters a mobster named George Nelson (Michael Badalucco), get heated up with a so-called bible salesman (John Goodman), encounter some Siren women who seduce them, and even record a song as The Soggy Bottom Boys (\"Man of Constant Sorrow\"). But their worst nightmare comes when the Sheriff (Daniel von Bargen) is tracking them down and won't stop until he either kills them or puts them back in prison.\r\n\r\nAlso, Charles Durning plays Pappy O'Daniel, a political leader, Wayne Duvall plays Homer Stokes, Papp's competitor, and Holly Hunter plays Penny, McGill's wife who's convinced that he was killed in a train wreck.\r\n\r\nWhere to begin about this film? Well, the casting in this film is unbelievably good. George Clooney is smart, smooth, and well-cast as McGill, the leader of the group, Tim Blake Nelson steals the show as Dunbar (\"They turned Pete into a toad.\"), while John Turturro is memorable as Pete (\"Do not go near the treasure.\") John Goodman was hilarious as the Bible salesman, Michael Badalucco was entertaining as the mobster (\"DON'T CALL ME BABYFACE!\"), while Holly Hunter was memorable as Clooney's wife.\r\n\r\nI thought O Brother, Where Art Thou was going to be a serious, overly melodramatic drama that would torture me until the credits roll. I was wrong. Instead, the film turned out to be a comedy, and in the end, O Brother Where Art Thou is one great, funny film. There's many memorable quotes, such as the one's I mentioned earlier, and the situations they get into turn out to be pretty hilarious. From the Soggy Bottom Boys performance, to the Siren women, to a scene where it's believed that Pete was turned into a toad, to the climatic flood sequence, O Brother Where Art Thou is an entertaining, never dull, and always enjoyable film that will put even the serious crowd a chuckle.\r\n\r\nThe music is the film's strongest highlight of the film. Featuring bluegrass music, each song is a delight and puts you in a cheery and sometimes inspiring mood. Some of my favorites are \"Keep on the Sunny Side\", the inspiring \"Down in the River to Pray\", and the opening credits number. But the best song is easily the film's signature tune, \"Man of Constant Sorrow.\" It's awesome. Even though you can clearly tell that George Clooney and his crew were not singing, the song is a hoot and will get stuck-in-your head instantly.\r\n\r\nO Brother Where Art Thou is a film that definitely exceeded my expectations. The casting is wonderful, the cinematography is beautiful and looks like the 1930's, and the music and humor really sets me in the mood. I'm glad I got to see this film, and I'll be glad to see it again.",

O BROTHER is one of the most fun films they've ever done. Less an American ODYSSEY than an American picaresque, it's filled with one damn thing after another as the chain-ganged, dumber-than-a-bag-of-hammers trio (played with skilled comic pitch by Clooney, Turturro, and Nelson) navigate a delightfully exaggerated American South to get home (or at least away from the law). It's still emotionally glib, but as an out-and-about comedy it keeps you laughing - and the endearing, none-too-bright characters win you over. With a great blues, folk & rockabilly soundtrack by T-Bone Burnett, O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU is magnificent entertainment.",

This movie was not just apreciated by me, almost everyone liked it, this movie has a 7.8 on IMDb, it was nominated for 2 Oscars and isn't that enough already, really, you should watch it if you haven't, I was a very lucky guy by having the chance to watch it, I've experienced a great movie, a diferent movie but never disapointing, it has amazing jokes in it that provided my big and long laughs and it has a fantastic, acutally Oscar-nominated script, so as it has fantastic actors. Sow, O Brother, Where Art Thou? might not be the Coens best movie, but it's one of their best, I really liked it and I'll always remind of it, it's really those kinds of movies that you just have pleasure to watch, trust me, it's really fun. Great movie.\n\nJoel and Ethan (Uncredited) Coen direct this movie, it's another great movie that they've created, they're really true genius guys and it doesn't matter what genre of movie they'll direct, it just has to be good, this movie show us that, they really did a great job and they left us here one remarcable comedy. George Clooney takes the lead role, this was defenitly not the highlight of his career but I like to consider it one of his best perfomances, I really enjoyed to see him here, he was funny and he played a great character so if someone asked me wich were George's five best perfomances, I would might mention O Brother, Where Art You?, George is known from The Descendents, The Ides of March, Syriana, Up in the Air, Ocean's Eleven and some other movies. John Turturro is great here, he was funny as always and talented as always, he was really great here, John is known from You Don't Mess with the Zohan, Barton Fink, Quiz Show, Anger Management and some other movies. Tim Blake Nelson is okay, just that, Tim is known from The Incredible Hulk, Holes, Minority Report and some other movies. John Goodman plays a supporting role but I enjoyed to see him here while it last, he was okay and he never disapoints, John is known from The Big Lebowski, Evan Almighty, Monsters, Inc., The Artist and some other movies. Sow, as you can see, this movie has a really good cast, it's full of amazing actors with a great history and all of them got to play a really nice and funny character in this movie, I enjoyed every actor that starred in this movie. Great cast.\n\nEverett (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) are three guys that during the Great Depression, escape from prison so they can find a hidden treasure. Their travel starts with a visit to Radio Station where the guys and a guy who they gave a lift sing a song that actually starts to be a big sucsess. The travel is cointinued by meeting weird kinds of people and doing all kinds of idiotnesses but they will also have to space from the cops. They have a plan, but not a clue.(What I thought about the plot) I really liked the plot, it was adapted by the Coen Brothers, wich turned into an Oscar nomination, it was very well written and it worked really well here, it's a really smart, entertaining and amusing plot that I really enjoyed. It was an adaptation of \"Odissey\" and from my point of view, it was really adapted and it show us that the Coen brothers are not just incredible directors and producers, they're also amazing movie writers. Great plot.\n\nSoundtrack, well, I don't remember any theme but they did sung some good musics, not amazing ones but some fine musics, if the actors really sung it, they did a great job.\n\nBesides all that, I am now going to tell you what I really thougth about this movie. First of all, O Brother, Where Art You? is a classic, not an outstanding or really memorable one but it is memorable and it's really good, it's really fun, it's a diferent kind of movie, it envolves comedy and entertaining in a great way, I enjoyed everything they did with this movie, they really made it fun and great. I realy apreciated to understand that they didn't want it to make it really serious, they just did a movie with care free, at least, it seemed and that seemed to work, cause with that act, they could create a light but very good movie, that's why O Brother, Where Art You? is very good, I really liked it and when it got to the end, I had a smile on my face that I just couldn't wipe, I think you should watch it with any concirnes, you'll have a great time and you won't even have to be focess, you'll just have to relax and enjoy it, wich is enough to get attached to it. Overall, this is a very fun movie that I'm sure it can provide a great time to everyone, it has a great cast, a great plot, it's hilarious and very entertaining, after I watched the first 5 minutes, I had no doubts that I was going to like it. Watch it if you haven't, it will not just provide you a good time, I just think that any movie lover should watch this, cause saying that you've watched O Brother, Where Srt Thou? is a thing that any movie lover should be able to say to anyone. O Brother, Where Art Thou: 7.0/10. Great.\n\nGreat movie. Very recommended movie. Grade: B-.",

This movie is filled to the brim with hilarious situations and performances,as well as more quotable lines than you'll probably find in most comedies. George Clooney, who made his Coen brothers debut with this role, casts aside any movie star vanity  to portray Everett Ulysses McGill, a chain gang convict who escapes in pursuit of treasure while chained to two other inmates, hotheaded Pete (John Turturro) and sweet natured but dim-witted Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson). Their adventures take them across the deep South, where every character they encounter is a delightfully realized eccentric of one sort or the other, from a blind recording studio owner on down to a one- eyed Bible salesman. The movie filled to the brim with that wonderfully quirky Coen dialogue that often times is the driving force behind their best hits, with Clooney in particular getting the lion's share of the good lines. And one more thing that must be mentioned is the cinematography by long time Coen collaborator Roger Deakins. This movie is quiet stunning simply to look at, with picturesque postcard visuals that really work well in making the South as much of a character as anything else. So, in conclusion, if you're not a Coen brothers fan already, there's worse places you could start than with this film. And if you are a fan and have not seen this.....WASSA MATTER WICHOO,HUH?! See this already! :)",

            "content": "This peculiar, Coen brothers take on Homer's \"Odyssey\" is a lot of southern fun. \n\nPLOT:After breaking out of a jail line-up, Everett (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro), and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) head on a journey to find a foretold treasure in a valley that is about to be flooded. Of course, things aren't going to go all according to plan. They'll have to flee the law in every direction they head in, but they just might become celebrities along the way in this early 1900s, Mississippian film. It's a well-adapted plot executed quite uniquely. \n\nACTING:The acting was alright considering most of the characters were either uneducated or painfully cliched southern folk. The shiners were George Clooney as Everett, John Turturro as Pete, Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar, Charles Durning as Pappy O'Daniel, Ray McKinnon as Vernon T. Waldrip, and John Goodman as Big Dan Teague. I believe with out Clooney, this film wouldn't have been as good as it really was. Turturro did a pretty great job too. I particularly didn't care for Holly Hunter as Penny. This wasn't really a good role for her. \n\nSCORE:This is also one of my favorite soundtracks. All of the music matches the time period that this was trying to recreate perfectly, plus some of the songs are either beautiful (\"Down to the River to Pray\") or toe-tappingly catchy (\"I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow\"). It's all of the same certain feel. \n\nOTHER CONTENT:This film was fun and had clever twists, accurate history, and an interesting story overall to be told. The Coen Brothers always come up with great films, and this one is no less. The only flaws in this are that there isn't much of a true plot and there are times where this can get a little jumbled up/confusing for the viewer. It's not everyone's type of film, but it's good. \n\nOVERALL,a great Coen brothers film with a uniquely executed plot, alright acting, good matching soundtrack, fun, clever twists, accurate history, and an interesting story, but there isn't too much of a plot, and things can get jumbled up sometimes.",

            "content": "The Coen Brothers are at their best when they start with existential darkness or absurdist comedy, and then build in zaniness or whimsy on top of that in small chunks. Barton Fink, for example, has a great story with weighty themes and a pessimist worldview, into which Steve Buscemi's character comes as an interesting and quirky piece of light relief. When they try and start with whimsy and then shove in weighty stuff on top, the film quickly loses its way or becomes self-indulgent, with The Hudsucker Proxy being the best example.\r\n\r\nO Brother, Where Art Thou? is interesting because it falls somewhere between these two camps groups. It has the foundation of a great story, being based on Homer's The Odyssey, and much effort has gone into retelling this story with both humour and pathos. But while you've always got a rough idea of where it's going, the film is full of distracting and increasingly unfunny whimsy which makes the storytelling more chaotic. Because there is such a strong, well-known story at the heart of it, it doesn't ever fall apart, but it remains a strangely uninvolving comedy.\r\n\r\nDespite claiming to have never read The Odyssey, the Coens have done a great job in matching all the key events in the story to a modern-day equivalent. The direct parallels are obvious for those of us who know the story, but they still work separated from that within the mechanics of the period setting. Some of the creative decisions are inspired, such as the Cyclops being replaced by a one-eyed conman and Ku Klux Klan member, played with typical gusto by John Goodman. There is also a good joke where Delmar and Everett go looking for a wizard to turn Pete back into a human; they end up infiltrating a Klan meeting, and come across the wrong kind of wizard.\r\n\r\nUnusually for a film of this scale, the music of O Brother was composed and recorded before filming. It functions like a Greek chorus, commenting on the trials and tribulations of the characters, articulating what they cannot say, and interacting with the characters like a nameless, shape-shifting protagonist. Acclaimed producer T. Bone Burnett used his extensive knowledge of American folk, bluegrass and jug band music to assemble a soundtrack which evokes its period down to the last detail. Even the production has an old-fashioned tinge to it, as if George Clooney and his colleagues were genuinely singing into 1930s microphones.\r\n\r\nThe scene which best illustrates the music being integral to the action comes when the trio of criminals comes across the sirens washing their clothes in the lake. Like Odysseus and his crew, they are quite literally lured onto the rocks by the sirens' songs, enticed by the beauty which reminds Everett of his wife and the others of the fact that they've not had for some time. The sirens' song is very much of the period, with its multi-part harmony and soothing, seductive refrain of \"go to sleep you little baby.\" But it also conveys the universal theme of temptation which is writ large both in Homer's work and in the criminals' story.\r\n\r\nThe other huge plus point of O Brother is the cinematography. The film is shot by the Coens' long-time collaborator Roger Deakins, who received his fourth of nine Oscar nominations thus far for his work. As we have come to expect from both Deakins and the Coens, the camera angles are expertly chosen and the compositions are superb. But beneath the position of the camera and manipulation of natural light, there is another aspect to Deakins' work which deserves to be recognised.\r\n\r\nThe film shot in the summer of 1999, and upon viewing the rushes the Coens were dissatisfied with the amount of bright colours present. They were looking for a washed-out, almost sepia look, to make the film look like a product of its time. Deakins' solution was to colour correct every shot to de-saturate the bright greens into yellows. Not only does this give the film a more old-fashioned look, it also adds to the mythical feel, with the vast yellow fields nodding towards Jason and the Golden Fleece. The film is significant for being the first to be colour corrected entirely by digital means, narrowly beating Nick Park's Chicken Run (although Chicken Run was released sooner, O Brother finished post-production earlier).\r\n\r\nSo far O Brother, Where Art Thou? seems to be cutting the mustard, both as a quirky adaptation of The Odyssey and as a film in its own right. But the more the film rolls on, and the more quirky its characters become, the less confident we are that the film is in control of all its wild excursions into the period and moments of artistic license. While Homer's story provides an anchor, and its major events are used to keep the plot moving, there's an odd feeling of the ship going round in circles even as it inches further forward.\r\n\r\nThe best way to explain what I mean by this is to compare the film to Lindsay Anderson's O Lucky Man!. Both films are translations of epic texts, with Anderson's three-hour oddity being a loose reworking of Voltaire's Candide. Both stories are based on a male protagonist who goes on a long journey of self-discovery and encounters many strange evils along the way. Most of all, both films are chock full of interesting or unusual scenes which don't necessarily gel into a seamless, well-structured whole.\r\n\r\nRoger Ebert wrote in his review that he had \"the sense of invention set adrift; of a series of bright ideas wondering why they had all been invited to the same film.\" There are many great moments and characters in O Brother, which work well in the same self-contained, incidental way that parts of Quentin Tarantino's films do. But despite the knowing thrill of meeting Tommy Johnson or George Nelson (don't call him Babyface), such encounters never become properly integrated into the plot.\r\n\r\nThe climactic scene of the film, where the trio perform at the political rally, demonstrates this feeling of characters intersecting and uneasily coexisting. The Soggy Bottom Boys perform their surprise hit, 'Man of Constant Sorrow', the reform candidate recognises them as the men who infiltrated the KKK meeting, and in trying to expose them turns the crowd against him and effectively loses the election. As a result of the success that the Soggy Bottom Boys seem destined to have, Penny gives her husband Everett another chance.\r\n\r\nThis contrived convergence of all the plot strands is problematic enough. But what's even more problematic is that these storylines break apart almost as soon as they have converged. The Soggy Bottom Boys are applauded wildly and seem destined to be stars - but they don't get signed up and we never hear of them again. The three criminals are pardoned by the Senator, but are then arrested again, and are only saved by the flooding of the plain caused by the building of the dam. And as soon as Penny has given her husband a second chance, they have a massive falling-out over her wedding ring and seem back to square one.\r\n\r\nThis last point also illuminates the character problems in the film. There is the ongoing problem in several of the Coens' films, where we are expected to laugh at people for the simple fact that they are idiots. The son and campaign managers of Pappy O'Daniel are regarded in  the same way as the protagonists in Burn After Reading or Raising Arizona: they're all idiots, and their antics apparently become hilarious on account of their stupidity.\r\n\r\nThe other problem is with Holly Hunter's character, whose demanding wife Penny stands in for Penelope in The Odyssey. But while Penelope is depicted as the model of loyalty and patience, in the film she is demanding and spiteful to the point of being obnoxious. Not only does she not wait for Everett to return, but she divorces him and lies to his children, saying he was hit by a train. Hunter is a talented actress, but you would have thought the Coens would have given her more to work with, given her contribution to their first two films.\r\n\r\nO Brother, Where Art Thou? is a strange, quirky little film which leaves you feeling both entertained and unsatisfied.  As a demonstration of how well The Odyssey translates, it works really well, and its period details are immaculate and enthralling. As an entity in and of itself, it falters on its inability to control and combine its various plot strands. On the whole it's enjoyable but not special, and certainly not the Coens' finest hour.",

Thanks to a great cast under phenomenal direction this is by far one of the of most enjoyable movie ever made.        \r\n\r\nO Brother Where Art Thou? is set in the deep south during the 1930's. In it, three escaped convicts search for hidden treasure while a relentless lawman pursues them. O Brother Where Art Thou? never gets complicated despite its many and thoughtful subplots. The humor is great thanks to the likable cast and their performance. There`s a lot to laugh about when watching like George Nelson yelling his name in a bank robbery, the Ku Klux Klan doing some ridiculous dance during a ceremony and giving a unrelated solution to a problem n a speech, Ulysses and Delmar thinking Pete was turned into a horny toad, and a Cow ending up on the roof of house during a flood. It`s not a movie that you're supposed to take serious which is why it's so much fun. Each character in this movie is surprisingly unique and memorable in their own way. The story is keeps your interest as it takes our characters in put them in unexpected situation that should guarantee laughter. As much as i'm praising the story I will add it`s a little too light hearted and it never takes it into a dark direction when given a great opportunity. It shouldn't bother the audience too much since the story does give us a lot to think about and enjoy. The story is memorable, simple, fun, and hilarious for all to enjoy and alone is worth viewing.                      \r\n\r\nGeorge Clooney was fantastic, his presence in the movie made that much better. Not only does he deliver the goods, he deliver laughs and a memorable portrayal. The rest of the cast is just as funny and entertaining. The Coen brothers know how to direct a movie as their direction is spot on and have a good sense of humor. I also enjoy the music in this movie, though it?s not personally my taste it?s really good. One thing about the movie is that it?s compare to the Coen brother other works which it shouldn?t be. Even though I haven?t seen their other work a comparison seems out of place, this isn?t exactly one of their more dramatic work either so you can?t have the same expectations in a different genre. It knows what?s trying be and I applauded for it.\r\n\r\nO Brother Where Art Thou? is enjoyable movie thanks to a likable cast, great writing, and the Coen brothers unmatched direction. It?s easily one of the most enjoyable ever made and certainly worth a watch for everyone.",

They're not reinventing the wheel here, but this is an immensely likable comedy filled with terrific comic performances and the same sharp writing that we're used to from Joel and Ethan.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the ensemble acting is a large part of what makes this film such a delight. Tim Blake Nelson and Coen regular John Turturro gets their share of the laughs, but it's star George Clooney that really makes the movie. He's usually thought of as a more serious actor, but here he shows a real affinity for comedy. He has impeccable timing and seems game for anything. It's a real treat watching him here. And in just a few scenes, Holly Hunter is a joy as well recalling her starring role from \"Raising Arizona\".\r\n\r\nThe other big crowd-pleasing element of the film is the wonderful music, including the irresistible \"Man of Constant Sorrow\". It's great, but there's great music all throughout the picture. And there is also a number of whimsical, off-the-wall moments in this that only filmmakers as talented as the Coen brothers could pull off. They make their unique mark on every single scene here.\r\n\r\n\"O Brother Where Art Thou?\" won't win any Oscars, but when you have writers and directors as talented as these guys, even their lesser efforts are something special. It may sound like a mess on paper, but on the big screen, it all comes together beautifully.",

This movie was not just apreciated by me, almost everyone liked it, this movie has a 7.8 on IMDb, it was nominated for 2 Oscars and isn't that enough already, really, you should watch it if you haven't, I was a very lucky guy by having the chance to watch it, I've experienced a great movie, a diferent movie but never disapointing, it has amazing jokes in it that provided my big and long laughs and it has a fantastic, acutally Oscar-nominated script, so as it has fantastic actors. Sow, O Brother, Where Art Thou? might not be the Coens best movie, but it's one of their best, I really liked it and I'll always remind of it, it's really those kinds of movies that you just have pleasure to watch, trust me, it's really fun. Great movie.\n\nJoel and Ethan (Uncredited) Coen direct this movie, it's another great movie that they've created, they're really true genius guys and it doesn't matter what genre of movie they'll direct, it just has to be good, this movie show us that, they really did a great job and they left us here one remarcable comedy. George Clooney takes the lead role, this was defenitly not the highlight of his career but I like to consider it one of his best perfomances, I really enjoyed to see him here, he was funny and he played a great character so if someone asked me wich were George's five best perfomances, I would might mention O Brother, Where Art You?, George is known from The Descendents, The Ides of March, Syriana, Up in the Air, Ocean's Eleven and some other movies. John Turturro is great here, he was funny as always and talented as always, he was really great here, John is known from You Don't Mess with the Zohan, Barton Fink, Quiz Show, Anger Management and some other movies. Tim Blake Nelson is okay, just that, Tim is known from The Incredible Hulk, Holes, Minority Report and some other movies. John Goodman plays a supporting role but I enjoyed to see him here while it last, he was okay and he never disapoints, John is known from The Big Lebowski, Evan Almighty, Monsters, Inc., The Artist and some other movies. Sow, as you can see, this movie has a really good cast, it's full of amazing actors with a great history and all of them got to play a really nice and funny character in this movie, I enjoyed every actor that starred in this movie. Great cast.\n\nEverett (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) are three guys that during the Great Depression, escape from prison so they can find a hidden treasure. Their travel starts with a visit to Radio Station where the guys and a guy who they gave a lift sing a song that actually starts to be a big sucsess. The travel is cointinued by meeting weird kinds of people and doing all kinds of idiotnesses but they will also have to space from the cops. They have a plan, but not a clue.(What I thought about the plot) I really liked the plot, it was adapted by the Coen Brothers, wich turned into an Oscar nomination, it was very well written and it worked really well here, it's a really smart, entertaining and amusing plot that I really enjoyed. It was an adaptation of \"Odissey\" and from my point of view, it was really adapted and it show us that the Coen brothers are not just incredible directors and producers, they're also amazing movie writers. Great plot.\n\nSoundtrack, well, I don't remember any theme but they did sung some good musics, not amazing ones but some fine musics, if the actors really sung it, they did a great job.\n\nBesides all that, I am now going to tell you what I really thougth about this movie. First of all, O Brother, Where Art You? is a classic, not an outstanding or really memorable one but it is memorable and it's really good, it's really fun, it's a diferent kind of movie, it envolves comedy and entertaining in a great way, I enjoyed everything they did with this movie, they really made it fun and great. I realy apreciated to understand that they didn't want it to make it really serious, they just did a movie with care free, at least, it seemed and that seemed to work, cause with that act, they could create a light but very good movie, that's why O Brother, Where Art You? is very good, I really liked it and when it got to the end, I had a smile on my face that I just couldn't wipe, I think you should watch it with any concirnes, you'll have a great time and you won't even have to be focess, you'll just have to relax and enjoy it, wich is enough to get attached to it. Overall, this is a very fun movie that I'm sure it can provide a great time to everyone, it has a great cast, a great plot, it's hilarious and very entertaining, after I watched the first 5 minutes, I had no doubts that I was going to like it. Watch it if you haven't, it will not just provide you a good time, I just think that any movie lover should watch this, cause saying that you've watched O Brother, Where Srt Thou? is a thing that any movie lover should be able to say to anyone. O Brother, Where Art Thou: 7.0/10. Great.\n\nGreat movie. Very recommended movie. Grade: B-.",

            "content": "I imagine the pitch for this movie might have seemed rather weak to the wrong Movie Producer, the oddball Coen Brothers directing duo, doing a film set in Dustbowl America, adapted from the Odyssey, starring that guy from ER, with a soundtrack that sounds like it's out of thirties and using cutting edge computer technology to color correct every cell of the film to give it a faded look that will add to the retro thirties effect. And yet the film has been one of the most successful of the Coen Brothers many works, doing well in its theatrical, keeping a devoted fan base to this day, having one of the bestselling soundtracks of all time and for better or worse changing the way movies were filmed for an entire decade. Regardless of how you feel about the movie it revolutionized the industry in a way few have noticed but those that have probably curse, color correction it was the first movie to be shot digitally, transferred to a computer and have the color scheme changed, to saturate the Mississippi landscape and as stated make the cells of the film look faded. It worked pretty damn well at the time for making a unique, and pleasant looking film experience though many probably couldn't have told you why but with the technology out there to be exploited it has basically since been used for mostly evil being the main contributor to the bland blue and orange landscape of the movies today. And not content to start annoying trends in moviemaking it started annoying trends in the music industry as well by popularizing the alright when used properly Producer T Bone Burnett for the now iconic soundtrack. I don't mix music, I can't explain how he does it but T Bone Burnett has become infamous for mixing all the music he produces to give it a lo-fi but high quality sound and after this soundtrack which utilized that for retro effect popularized that every semi folk or country hack looking to get started or make a comeback came to T Bone for a boring lo-fi effect on their record and it took almost ten years for that trend to die. And yet despite the mess it left in its unfortunate legacy, O Brother Where Art Thou? Is debatably the most popular of the Coen Brothers many works, which begs the question why? Is it truly the best among a quite illustrious list? Is it just the most accessible amid a pretty weird catalogue? Or are people just wrong about this one? Let's take a bona fide pater familias look.\r\n\r\nOur quick witted and silver tongued protagonist is Ulysses \"Everett\" McGill (George Clooney, this is one of his best and most unique comic performances) a Mississippi dust bowl conman serving time in a chain gang. Everett is supposedly in prison for robbing an armored car, and the cash which he stashed in his valley Lodge will be under water in four days as the state plans to flood the valley to provide hydro-electrical power to the surrounding area. So he enlists the aid of chain mates Pete (John Turturro, one of his best starring roles he lends a lot of humor as the anger prone one) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson, who is damn near inspiring as the loveable simpleton) to break three and set out on a quest across the state to risk life and limb and recover the treasure. Along the way they continually encounter incumbent governor Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning, a real comedic highlight as he blows southern spiced gasket over everything) in his quest to defeat reform candidate and anti-big government Homer Stokes (Wayne Duvall, a bizarre and equally hilarious turn as a really freakish character) by harnessing old timey sensibilities. Meanwhile the boys also cut a hit record as the Soggy Bottom Boys with blues guitarist Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King, kind of a background performance) who's sold his soul to the devil to play the geetar. But many less savory obstacles await them as they will face traitorous kin, sirens, a bi polar bank robber and one nasty Cyclops (John Goodman, a fun performance but a sad one as well as Goodman said he'd never work with the Brothers again as they constantly cast him in the same roles).\r\n\r\nI personally adore this movie and it will always be perfect in my heart, I remember watching it on countless car rides, on a friend's iPod for the first time going to the beach and jamming out to the soundtrack on many occasions. This is why I regret to say it is deeply flawed from a narrative standpoint even for the Brothers Coen. Now don't get me wrong a lot of things about this movie really work and are incredible, the beautiful cinematography, sharp directing, wonderful music, and comedically genius performances but the fact is the story just has too many holes and could definitely have been told better. It quickly establishes a central conflict by giving a countdown saying our trio must reach the valley in four days. But it never establishes how far away the valley is or even why the valley will be flooded till the very end when it doesn't really matter. It gives us a four day limit before the valley is toast but it takes much longer than four days (including a few musical montages of old timey antics) to reach the central conflict and implies afterwards it takes quite a long time from there to reach the valley and not to give anything away the valley floods at the end. Now in all fairness the pretense of getting to the treasure is pretty flimsy as the discerning viewer can tell right away from how vaguely Everett sets up this race against the clock he has some ulterior motive for breaking out but even when they reach the real event for which they escaped more than four days still should have passed. Too give credit where credits do though, the twist of Everett's real motive is perhaps unearned but significantly improves the film in my opinion as well as strengthening the Odyssey parallels and is one of the few movies I can think of the pull of the whole \"climax, than wait surprise climax remember this subplot?\" ploy. And the Odyssey homages though not direct are really great, maybe this would have been more interesting as a direct adaption into a new setting and time but I was satisfied with a few nods and a basic overall arch and carrying themes of an intelligent man with a lot of vanity and hubris trying to return to his family while first having to reconcile himself spiritually. This is a stylish movie with a lot of nods to the Odyssey and Dustbowl Mississippi culture so it's hard to find that much fault in it when there's such fun to be had. But it is still hard to ignore the messed up timetable and how confusing it is to remember where they're even going or what they're doing...or why they keep losing their cars.\r\n\r\nO Brother, Where Art Thou? Has a lot wrong with it and annoyance with it can be understood and perhaps even expected, but through the myriad of glib southern humor there's far too much to be enjoyed about it to hold that against it. It has enjoyable characters, many memorable moments if not a lot to string some of them together and some real heart amid the mess of the story and any movie that can have those accolades heaped on it deserves to be watched. It's certainly not the best Coen Brothers movie, though it may be the most accessible but you can certainly do worse, it is not the worst Coen Brothers movie by far.",

George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are perfectly cast as the charismatically brainless scoundrels at the story's epicenter, while guest spots from John Goodman, Holly Hunter and Charles Durning take the whole mess over the top.

If I were to list pros and cons about O Brother, it would definitely have more pros than cons, but there's something about the aimless story that I can't quite enjoy.\n\nIn O Brother, the one thing I admired most was it's aesthetics. Visually, the film is a winner. Scenes that involve the KKK, a tidal wave, and especially three sirens are all constructed absolutely beautifully. The music selection fit the film perfectly and really bolstered what was happening on screen. However, when the cast \"sings\" it's so terribly unrealistic, it's almost embarrassing. Maybe the was the intent, but either way, I didn't like that it was painfully fake.\n\nBut what the actors lacked in competent singing, they surely made up for in acting. Clooney gets a lot of praise for his role, but I honestly thought he did all right. Tuturro and Nelson did a better job at sticking with their accents and remaining in character.\n\nThe quirky nature of a Coen's film is there still. Their witty dialogue, unique story, and originality is all present in O Brother, but it's the incoherency in the film that doesn't do it for me.\n\nI'm sure if I watch it more I may be able to appreciate it. It's a great looking film, with enjoyable segments, it's often funny, but nothing ever gets done. It may be because George Clooney is in it haha. I'm not too partial to his acting, but I try to remain objective. 6.5/10",

One character, George (\"not Babyface!\") Nelson, has both a violent side and a psychotic side. We see them meld into one personality in scenes such as the one in which he tips his head out of the roof of a car, begins cackling and recklessly firing an automatic weapon.\n\nWhat's excruciating about this film is that the film goes far enough on a bizarre tangent that it often relies singularly on being an offbeat, wacky comedy, rather than building up a noticeable plot. That is to say, half the time, such as during the scene in which our trio disguises themselves as members of the Ku Klux Klan, we REALLY don't know what on Earth is going on.
