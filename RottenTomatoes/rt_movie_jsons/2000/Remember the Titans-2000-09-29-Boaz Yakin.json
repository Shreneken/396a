    "summary": "In Virginia, high school football is a way of life, an institution revered, each game celebrated more lavishly than Christmas, each playoff distinguished more grandly than any national holiday. And with such recognition, comes powerful emotions. In 1971 high school football was everything to the people of Alexandria. But when the local school board was forced to integrate an all black school with an all white school, the very foundation of football's great tradition was put to the test.",

Set in 1971 Virginia, racial tensions are ramped up when the local high school becomes integrated, causing significant social issues within the community as well as within the school's football program.  The performances, including that of Denzel Washington as the head coach, are uniformly solid, the production values are great, the soundtrack is stellar, and the football action feels real.  Where it becomes frustrating, and it happens early and it happens often, is the fact that the swelling music score consistently sets the table for inspirational speech after inspirational speech, all leading to the following questions: Will the players learn to see beyond the color barrier?  Will the team win the state championship?  Will the head coach be accepted by the community?  You probably know the answers to these questions even if you haven't watched the movie yet.",

This movie is based on real events, though altered to serve the narrative of people working together despite racial differences. Denzel's performance in this movie is terrific and the writing for him and the rest of the movie is really good. I think the standout performance in this movie is Hayden Panettiere as Sheryl Yoast, the daughter of the white coach. As a child actress, she had to speak a lot of football lingo and she sold it well and stole most of the scenes she was in. This is a great movie that I think everyone should see, but not something that I would watch on repeat which is what my higher ratings are for.",

            "content": "In the summer of 1971, at the newly integrated T. C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), a black head coach who was supposed to lead the black high school's football team, is assigned to the coaching staff under current white head coach Bill Yoast, who previously led the white high school and has been nominated for the Virginia High School Hall of Fame. In an attempt to placate rising racial tensions and the fact that all other high schools are \"white\" only, the school district decides to change course and name Boone the head coach. He refuses, believing it unfair to Yoast, but relents after seeing what it means to the black community. Yoast is then offered an assistant coach's job by the school board and initially refuses but reconsiders after the white players pledge to boycott the team if he does not participate. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind and takes up the position of defensive coordinator under Boone, to his daughter Sheryl's dismay. Soon after, the black students trying out for the team have a meeting in the gymnasium with Boone, but this turns into a fiasco when Yoast and several white students interrupt it. After this, Boone takes Yoast aside and explains how he will run the team and that black and white does not matter to him, leaving Yoast with renewed faith in Boone. On August 15, the players gather and journey to Gettysburg College, where their training takes place. Early on, the black and white team members frequently clash in racially motivated conflicts, including some between captains Gerry Bertier and Julius Campbell. However, through forceful coaching and rigorous athletic training by Boone‚Äîwhich includes an early morning run to the Gettysburg National Cemetery and a motivational speech‚Äîthe team achieves racial harmony and comes out a unified team. After returning from football camp, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be dismissed. Subsequently, the Titans go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice before slowly gaining support from the community...\n\nAmong mainstream critics in the U.S., Remember the Titans received generally positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes consensus states: \"An inspirational crowd-pleaser with a healthy dose of social commentary, Remember the Titans may be predictable, but it's also well-crafted and features terrific performances.\" James Berardinelli writing for ReelViews, called the film \"relentlessly manipulative and hopelessly predictable\" but noted that it was \"a notch above the average entry in part because its social message (even if it is soft-peddled) creates a richer fabric than the usual cloth from which this kind of movie is cut.\" Describing some pitfalls, Robert Wilonsky of the Dallas Observer said that \"beneath its rah-rah rhetoric and pigskin proselytizing, it's no more provocative or thoughtful than a Hallmark Hall of Fame film or, for that matter, a Hallmark greeting card. Its heart is in the right place, but it has no soul.\" Wilonsky however was quick to admit \"The film's intentions are noble, but its delivery is ham-fisted and pretentious; you can't deny the message, but you can loathe the messenger without feeling too guilty about it.\" Todd McCarthy, writing in Variety, said, \"As simplistic and drained of complexity as the picture is, it may well appeal to mainstream audiences as an 'if only it could be like this' fantasy, as well as on the elemental level of a boot camp training film, albeit a PG-rated one with all the cuss words removed.\"[22] Roger Ebert, in the Chicago Sun-Times, viewed the film as \"a parable about racial harmony, yoked to the formula of a sports movie,\" adding, \"Victories over racism and victories over opposing teams alternate so quickly that sometimes we're not sure if we're cheering for tolerance or touchdowns. Real life is never this simple, but then that's what the movies are for\".\n\n\"Remember The Titans\" ends up in the same trap as \"Friday Night Lights\", not managing to stay on the right side of being a strong drama but rather being a silly melodrama despite being based on a true story and it has an important message concerning race. \"Remember The Titans\" is a stereotypical sports film with silly dialogue/silly scenes and a more or less predictable storyline and a overbearing American gung ho vibe. Denzel is solid as always, but that¬¥s not enough for me. And I couldn¬¥t stand Hayden Panettiere precocious 9 year old.",

            "content": "Remember the Titans is a masterpiece, probably the greatest movie I have ever watched! This movie has brought history to life. This movie was first introduced to me in middle school, where when I watched it, I thought it was just a football movie that had racism in it. As I continued to rewatch the movie, as my high school health teacher, who witnessed this happening in real life since she attended school with the real characters in the movie, I started to witness the details for its true meaning. I started to put myself in the shoes of the actresses shoes, on how bias the school system was, impacting a sports event, where being a different race should not impact the game, the performance of the athletes as well as the chemistry and performance of the team in whole should be the one to talk and show what the end game score should be. Remember the titans had many symbolisms, from the new head coach being seen as a god and savior due to him bringing in equality for each player to the controversy that each race has faced, both races learning the true meaning of racism from their own experiences, changing their perspective on one another. I have seen other sports movies such as 42, My All American, Dangal, Coach Carter, and a few more, but none of those could stand up to the emotions that Remember the Titans had. This movie tackled real life issues that we have faced over the years and are still facing, such as racism, equality, and death. If you were to watch this movie, you would think it would display just football and racism, but it includes inspirational speeches by not just the coaches, but the players themselves; displaying a few scenes of a musical to show the atonement of happiness. This movie had inspired me to watch several other sports movies and to pay attention to the scenes, either by what the actresses were saying, the music playing in the background, or just by the way the actresses were being presented, such as the zooming in on the actresses and blurring everything out when something important between the two are happening. I would definitely recommend watching this movie because it has happiness and sadness, but it teaches you a whole lot about history and how the impacts were not just impacting adults, but it was teaching the children to hate at a young age. I would watch this movie with anyone who would give it a try, since it just isn't about sports at the end of the day, it is about the message that the movie is trying to give out, by using football as an example of it since this event actually took place in real life with TC Williams High Schools football team.",

Will Patton is sound as Bill, while Ethan Suplee is hilarious in his parts as Louie.\n\nCredit to Ronna Kress for the rest of the casting, a lot of well-known faces in this. Ryan Gosling, Ryan Hurst, Hayden Panettiere, Donald Faison - that's pretty impressive.\n\nAs with most biopics, it isn't 100% accurate but it does a respectable job at the portrayal of problems of the time - even if it is carried by Washington & Co.",

I recall seeing this film shown several times in school to demonstrate true sportsmanship and decency. To understand someone different from your takes a kind of bravery that is integral to society.\n\nThe music score is beautiful much like the variety of 1970's era songs that light up Remember the Titans' soundtrack like the floodlights of a football field. The clothing, language, and social dynamic all fit the era. You often feel you are watching a documentary rather than just a recreation.\n\nDenzel Washington is phenomenal as the tough and groundbreaking coach. His speeches and demeanor will inspire you like his players. Denzel delivers not only a convincing performance, but a dramatic level of acting that touched a generation of actors and audiences. Alongside Malcolm X, Training Day, and Fences stands Remember the Titans proudly.\n\nI must also mention the excellent supporting role from Will Patton. His assistant coach displays an important side to the story of a man that changes his perspective entirely. It is in steps towards progress like this story that we move society forward towards a new understanding of each other.\n\nThis is a great film, an entertaining movie, a gripping football tale, an informative historical piece, and a wonderful parable.

And it also explains how these young men work together to form strong friendships and are able to become football champions. In this paper, it will be explained why and how this movie portrays friendship using the characters, respect, and how looking deeper into other's eyes could possibly change things. The main purpose of this movie is to create friendships, these friendships in the movie symbolises learning about each other and using it to mend the bond. And how friendship is based on the color that stands out to others from the inside, instead of out.Characters in the movie \"Remember the Titans\" makes this movie golden. The way they act, helps the audience see what is going on and the tension that is going on inside the movie.  The way the characters bond slowly throughout the movie with each other, makes \"friendship\" an inspirational aspect. The 2 main characters Coach Boone, played by Denzel Washington, and Coach Yoast, played by Will Patton, also set the movie up. It shows how these two coaches take a group of boys, and make them respect each other, to be successful. Which causes the group of boys to become friends, as well as get to know each other. By forcing the love of football onto them, they realize that friendship is a big deal in any kind of sport you play. For example, at the camp Gettysburg, they will have 2-day practices, until they get to know every person's name, and what that person likes. For example, Louie Lastik, one of the football players says, \"I eat lunch with Rev sir.... Me and Rev both dig on the Temptations sir.\"Boone used the cemetery at Gettysburg, as the example for having the players get to know each other better. He said \" 50,000 men died right here, fighting the same fight that we are still fighting amongst ourselves today.... Listen to their souls man, kill my brother with malice in my heart. Hatred destroyed my family...You listen take a lesson from the dead. If we don't come together right now, on this hallowed ground we too will be destroyed.\" This shows how many people use to fight others over color of skin, fighting over which part of this country you come from. But, he also is trying to say that, if we don't come together we will destroy ourselves without the work and understanding of others. Friendship can be built in and with anybody, and they don't have to be the same color skin, or from the same place that you're from. As a society, we need to come together and put aside our differences.\"I don't care if you like each other or not but, you will respect each other.\" Respect, is something you earn. It's not just given to you, you have to work for it. In this movie, respecting each other is another important point. Having respect for others, especially who aren't like you, is very one, very important point made in this movie. For example, those who have different backgrounds, like the characters in this movie. Judging a book by its cover is not a very great way to understand and become friends with people, and in this movie, it shows us how these young men overcame that. In conclusion, \"Remember the Titans\" showed great emphasis on the importance of seeking the differences in people physically, emotionally, and mentally. And making lasting friendships with people who have different ethnic backgrounds and interests, as well as social lives. It also shows how working together as a team can strengthen each other as individuals, and as a whole. Learning how to respect other people's point of views and understand where they are coming from is a key topic in this movie created by Yakin. The thing that I learned was that different people have different things that they value, and different perspectives that others might not see.",

            "content": "In a time of separation, change, and -in honor of the super bowl- football; a movie such as Remember the Titans is a great reminder of the enduring actions that took place when America was in another time of great change. This movie portrays the real life story of a town called Alexandria, Virginia experiencing major integration transitions in 1971. Not only does their high school, T.C. Williams High, become integrated; but also their praised football team who traded their beloved head coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) for an African American coach named Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). Washington again provides the world with another great performance. His portrayal of a high-stressed and intense football coach is evident as he tends to obnoxiously chew his gum throughout every play of a game and expresses his anger with football referees by humoring the audience with his lack of personal space and dramatic hand motions. Boone, a humble and family-oriented man, decides to let Yoast become an assistant coach; together the two struggle to work hand-and-hand in front of the town and, more importantly, their players throughout the season. This movie is an inspiring reflection of one of the greatest transitions in American history, shown through the eyes of all ages and a sport that we have all grown to love.\nThe original T.C. Williams High football captain and All-American, Gary Bertier, was brilliantly played by Ryan Hurst. Hurst turns Bertier's natural aggressive body posture into a less-dominant and respectful-type mannerism in times of tension. Usually, this happens when Washington approaches Bertier with his portrayal of an intimidating and almost humorous type of coaching authority. Another character that was delivered by a talented actor was Bertier's new found friend, Julius Campbell (Wood Harris). Harris also turns his intimidating first impression into a surprisingly timid personality throughout the movie. This was conveyed to the audience when Julius walks into Bertier's white dominant neighborhood for the first time and delivers a nervous stutter when confronted by Bertier's neighbors. Ultimately, both of these actors were able to take the harsh judgements people had regarding their new found friendship and reacted in a way that will surely make the audience feel uncomfortable at times. Later on in the movie the actors were able to warm the hearts of all that were watching by bringing comfort and a sense of brotherhood to both of their characters whenever they would step onto the football field. \nScenes like this captured the hearts of many due to the genius behind the camera, Philippe Rousselot. Rousselot's ingenuity perfectly captured a scene where Sunshine wants to take Blue and Petey to a restaurant to celebrate their win. When Sunshine forces his two friends into the restaurant, Rousselot captured Petey and Blue's desire to hide by creating an over-the-shoulder shot, giving the audience the perspective of the two young men's unwelcome feeling in a public venue within their own town. Shots like this helped depict the society-changing transition this town was going through from both the white and African American perceptive. \nThe emotions this movie illustrates to its audience is due to the work of Gregory Allen Howard who beautifully wrote the screenplay for this movie. Howard was able to show the audience how to turn tragedy into togetherness with his inspirational, heart-warming, and witty screenplay. As he located a memorable scene at the Battlegrounds of Gettysburg, he had Washington deliver a speech to the players that will surely send chills down your spine. \nHoward was able to deliver a lesson of overpowering hate with acceptance in a way that makes the audience form a loving bond towards this movie. This lesson was greatly needed for that time (1971), but also one that our society is in need of today. Because \"before we reach for hate; always, always, we remember the Titans\".",

This is one of those films that I haven't seen, and everybody has in school, which I kept in my DirecTV list for a few years. When I was thinking that I need to delete some movies, this was one of them, and after watching it, I had a hard time deleting it because it was better than I thought was going to be. Denzel Washington is just amazing as he usually does, and gives his performances 100% from any film that he's in, and when he gave some speeches in this, it's really effective and make you feel that you're along the ride with them. Will Patton is good in it, and it feels believable when he's going through a transition that is supportable. The characters are a lot of fun, especially the team who are just trying to deal with high school because of the people in there that's racially diverse. The football scenes are fun to watch, even when you know where it was going in the climax. The story is a little bit different than what you see in a film like this, but you can see where it was going at times. There are a lot of good-feel moments where it's the speeches that are well-written, or the dances which I remember seeing something like that in a Frosted Flakes commercial. I like the social commentary of the film with the racial issue as it's similar, but is different for what it is. Remember the Titans is a really great film that honestly could've been worse when it's Disney at the early age when dealing with serious stuff, and while it's not quite as extreme as you usually see, there are some adult moments in there that'll shocked kids, but still have humor and heart in there that'll get kids laughing and smiling with their parents.",

            "content": "Remember This Movie-It's a Score!\nRemember the Titans is quite simply one of the greatest sports movies ever made. From tensions to touchdowns, the film follows the true story of a high school football team that defies all odds by coming together and overcoming racial differences. \nSet in Virginia in the 1970's, the film delves into tensions involving school segregation. A federal mandate to desegregate closed the white and black high schools and students were sent to T.C. Williams High School. Successful football coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) was replaced by black coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) in an attempt to suppress negativity from the community. Coach Boone accepted the position and Yoast grudgingly accepted an assistant coaching position. The initial challenge the athletes faced came while attending training camp, however. Tensions rose and fights broke out, but coach Boone kept his team in check. He forced the team members to spend time together and get to know each other as people rather than colors. A morning run to the Gettysburg battlefield was a reminder that the battle the team was fighting was the same as their ancestors'. Once those racial walls were broken down, the athletes returned home where the real challenge awaited them: the responsibility to exemplify what they had learned. \nThe film shows racial issues of that time period, but spends more time showing the football team's accomplishments. Nevertheless, the film is still an excellent feel-good movie with emotional scenes between athletes and coaches, the Gettysburg scene being one of the best.  \nUnlike other sports films that focus on successes and trials of individual athletes (e.g. When the Game Stands Tall or 1000 to 1), Remember the Titans is a comeback story about a team's hardships.  \nRemember the Titans is a step above other sports films because the historical and emotional lessons it teaches are fantastic. The film is a successful interpretation of societal issues from the 1970s while incorporating a high school football team's story of overcoming adversity.",

            "content": "A Film Worth Remembering.\n\n\tTaking place in Virginia, \"Remember the Titans\" brings the tensions of integration to life. The film follows the struggles of a football fanatic town as their high school, and football team, integrate. Coach Boone, an African American man, is sent in to fill the position of head coach, knocking out, well known and well loved, head coach Yoast. Though the two men faced their own issues of pride and difference in coaching styles, they battle to overcome their differences and develop a bond that will carry over to their players. \n\n\tDenzel Washington, Coach Boone, encounters racism throughout the entirety of the film. At one point a member of the local black community comes to Boone, asking him to decline the head coach position to keep the town peaceful. Boone responds, \"I just can't do that.\" His wife then walks into the room telling him there's something he needs to see outside. As soon as he steps onto the porch, applause fills the night air. The street was completely filled with members of his community. He stood in awe as they displayed their love and support. The world would do well to learn from Boone's character. We need more people who are willing to not only stand up for what they believe in, but to stand by it - no matter who is trying to push them down. Boone refuses to be bullied or belittled. I'd love to see him and Trump go head to head.   \n\nSome of the most monumental moments of the film take place at Boone's boot camp. As the boys are loading the buses, Gerry Bertier, former team captain, approaches Coach Boone telling him who plays which position and that Boone's black players are basically not needed. Boone stands closer to Gerry and in a soft stern voice tells him to take a good long look at his mama because she's not coming on the bus with him. He says, \"Now when you get on that bus, you know who your daddy is right? Who's your daddy Gerry?\" At this moment, Boone demands respect from the leader of the white half of his new football team. He also establishes that he is a family man, and he fully intends to turn this team into a family. After seating everyone on the bus by position, therefore integrating the buses, Boone announces that the player they are sitting next to will also be their roommate at camp. Gerry Bertier and Julius Campbell, new promising player, find themselves sitting next to each other but have no idea their friendship will become unshakeable, and eventually their example leads not only the team, but the town. The moment their movement starts is after they complete a good play at camp. Gerry excitedly shoves Julius and yells, \"LEFT SIDE!\" Julius hesitantly looks at Gerry for a moment, then shoves back yelling, \"STRONG SIDE!\" The chant continues as they grab each other by the jersey and come head to head. Physically, it looks as if they are about to kill each other. They are quite literally butting heads. However, the emotion of this scene is high as it is the first moment that racial barriers truly begin to fall within the team. The two join the forces of their influence to start truly integrating the team. \n\nWhen the season officially starts, the Titans begin winning games, and the town erupts. It seems nothing could possibly go wrong, but like any good film, \"Remember the Titans\" calls an audible, that will surely toss the audience the most stressful trick play yet. It will have the audience cheering and crying along with the well developed characters. \n\n\tDirector Boaz Yakin took it to the endzone with this film. Not only was he able to capture the emotion and tension of the time period, he managed to do so in a family friendly way. The film refrains from major profanity and racial terms, if only our presidential candidate could do the same. The film is well paced and well spaced. All in all, this sports drama might be one of Yakin's best films yet. \n\nAlthough this film is 16 years old, it remains incredibly relevant as our society faces racial and sexual discrimination. We could learn from Boone's integrity, respect, and leadership. It wouldn't hurt for us to brush up on the loyalty, virtue, perseverance and friendship displayed by Gerry and Julius. \"Remember the Titans\" is indeed worth remembering; many of the issues handled within the film need to be handled in today's world. As viewers follow the movement and growth of their favorite characters, it's no surprise they too will leave with the desire to become better and help make our society one history will want to remember.",

Based upon a less well-known episode in the racial history of American sports, the integration of a high school football team in Alexandria, Virginia in 1971, it provides an awful lot of swelling from within.  \nCoach Boone (Denzel Washington) and Coach Yoast (Will Patton) meet in the beginning of the movie and Coach Yoast shares his concern that his players won't play.  Coach Boone then says that the best player will play, skin color doesn't matter.  Coach Yoast then responds with, \"Coach, I'm afraid that is the only thing that does matter right now.\"  Coach Boone and Coach Yoast do an unbelievable job of balancing the effects of racism in developing these young football players into men.  They use football to teach them to control their anger on the gridiron, but most importantly, in real life.   \nThe moment that changes the team from a group of individual to an actual team is when Coach Boone takes them on a run through the woods to Gettysburg.  He shares his feelings of how 50,000 men died on the very ground they were standing on fighting the same battle they were fighting today.  Life is not necessarily about liking everyone you're around, but respecting them.  That's all Boone asks from them, to help them become a group of men. \nIn the end of it all, this movie crosses more than one goal line and overcomes defeat.  The Titans defy the odds and conquer defeat in the game of football, but more importantly, in the game of life.",

            "content": "\"Remember the Titans\" is a movie based in 1970s. An all-white school becomes integrated by black students. This soon becomes dangerous when people from the community, parents, and students begin to realize that it is an adjustment that no one is ready to make. The students are divided, but began to break down the color barriers as they realize that they all must work together if they want to win the football championship. The original coach of the football team becomes furious after he is demoted and must now be second in command to an African American (Denzel Washington). This is an amazing film that everyone should get the chance to watch.\n\tThe actors were all top notch performers. Not a second in the movie would pass by where the audience members were not holding on to every word spoken. From the plays, to the locker-room, to the scenes where the players were home, their acting skills would shine through. When a character was introduced that gave the audience a reason to dislike them (like the coaches on the other teams), there would be genuine hate attached to that character.  Each of the players played an important part in bringing the movie to life.\n\tThis is a fast paced drama that depicts racial tension among racially integrated schools and football teams. Race and segregation are both touchy issues, and the film did a good job portraying the issues despite the fact that this was a Walt Disney produced movie. There were few to know racial slurs thrown during the movie (which I appreciated). \n\tThe different settings help add to the progression of the movie. The high-school shows how the students begin acting once the school becomes integrated. Steeped in racial turmoil, little to no contact is made among the football players. As the film moves to the football field, tension is still high as the boys try to outshine each other rather than work together. \nIt isn't until they lose a game that they realize that they must put aside their differences and work together. At a time when people could not be more divided, football brought everyone together. This sudden change of heart allowed the boys to bond both on and off the field. You begin to see their lives, as well as the community, change as they become more accepting of the other race. The head coach (Denzel Washington) is also receiving hate from each of the other coaches because he is African American and coaching an integrated team. Their tones begin to change after they realize that their comments don't hold much value once the Titans begin to win.\n\tThe rich dialogue keeps the audience focused on the excitement unfolding within the movie, but also supplies you with scenes of comic relief. There is a shower scene where they guys bond by singing a song (I know it sounds cheesy, but it works). One quote that many people remember is from the head coach. He is being disrespected by another coach, but responds with, \"I don't scratch my head unless it itches and I don't dance unless I hear some music. I will not be intimidated. That's just the way it is.\" This quote alone shows the unbreakable spirit that the characters in the movie have. \n\tRemember the Titans is a classic. It handles the plot better than a lot of films from its time, and also tops the charts as a family favorite. The film shows the racial tension begin to die down as the football players begin to bond. When the Titans accepted each other as brothers, their community saw them as a team.",

All of this is shown from the viewpoint of Herman Boone, played by Denzel Washington, the black coach who usurped the successful incumbent and stirred racial prejudices amongst the general public.\n\nAlso featuring a cast that includes Will Patton, Wood Harris, Ryan Hurst, Kate Bosworth and an early small role for Ryan Gosling, the film is well acted, and it takes the racial tension and portrays it in a reasonably gripping way.

Ever films in the genre seem to embody the feel good aspect that has been a staple of the genre since the early sports movies, and I'm fine with that. With Remember the Titans, we have a good drama that is based on real events, and does something a bit different than your normal genre film, but it does add the typical elements that are we come to expect with these films. What is great about the film is the fact that it adds a lot to the story by showing the racial tension, and in doing that, the plot becomes more intricate, engaging and thought provoking. The performances are very good, and there several that stand out, especially that of its lead actors Denzel Washington and Will Patton. The film tackles an important subject that goes beyond the sports dramatic genre, and it does it pretty well. However, I did feel that at times there could have been a few improvements as well. Remember the Titans is a good film, but one that should really have stood considering the subject the film displays. If this wasn't released by Disney, then maybe a much better movie would have been made. This is good for what it is, but you end up wanting more from its story. For a sports film that uses the issue of race in its story, this film really should have been memorable. But what we have here is good entertainment, but to viewers wanting a bit more, you'll be a bit disappointed because like all other genre films, it is a tad predictable, and it left a lot of unexplored ideas that just never came to fruition.

In order to be successful they have to put aside the differences of their skin tone. It gives you a slight visual into what is was like back then in regards to newly integrated schools. You can see the struggles the students faced and the director uses a football team to metaphorically show the struggle within the school and how it is possible to become a family and get along no matter what the color of your skin is. While watching the movie you will see humor, happiness, sadness, camaraderie, internal and external struggle, compromise, and love. If you want to see a movie that will tap in all sorts of different emotions than this is one for you. In my opinion this is one of the greatest movies ever made, with a mixture of serious issues with some light heartedness this is a classic that the whole family can see. Whatever your age, you can definitely take something away from seeing Remember the Titans.",

The movie appeals to football fans as well as the average viewer, using a football team to describe the struggles of African Americans in the 1970s and how they overcome the race barrier. Based on a true story, this movie follows the journey of Coach Herman Boone in coaching the newly integrated TC Williams High School football team. Denzel Washington plays the role of the frank, passionate coach who is not afraid to tell it how he sees it while attempting to integrate African Americans into the program. His intensity throughout the whole movie is mesmerizing and he churns out memorable interactions with his players. In one such moment, Coach Boone asks his running back (Petey) after he fumbles a ball: \"How many feet are in a mile? How many feet are in a mile?\" After Petey mumbles, Boone screams at him, \"5,280 feet! You pick this ball up and run every one of em! You're killing me, Petey! You're killing me!\" While the plot is fairly predictable and not necessarily riveting, the movie more than makes up for it with tense emotional moments and a likability the viewer develops for both the players and the coaches. Overall, it is a certainly worth seeing for people of all ages, and also sends a strong societal message to the audience.",

            "content": "The last thing I expected from Remember the Titans was for it to be a Disney movie, but I would never miss a Denzel Washington film and I'm sure that with him on board they wouldn't mess it up.\n\nAmerican football films tend to be dark and gritty as they emphasise the savage nature of football. But with Disney producing the film, they emphasise the fact that \"Football is about controlling anger\" as Denzel Washington rates early on. That way it lightens to mood of the film without ever reducing itself into descending into melodramatic territory. And luckily enough, Boaz Yakin respects his viewers enough not to hide its racial subject matter away from viewers. \nWhile the view of racism is dealt with rather simplistically, it does so in such a basic manner that young viewers are able to easily comprehend the idea and learn from it as well. Although at times it feels like the film is playing it a bit safe and only lightly touching upon its theme of racism so that it can still remain light and family friendly as a way of sticking with Disney standards, overall the experience was good. I liked the fact that the film lightly touched upon the theme because it reminds us that racial equality is really not something that needs to be dramatised, its simply just something that doesn't need to be thought about too much. Equality shouldn't require audiences to think and truly consider if it is ok, they should just acknowledge the fairness in it and move on. I guess all in all I have mixed feelings about how Remember the Titans tackles racism because it doesn't think too much about the idea and plays it a bit safe, but really it doesn't need to. The only problem is that since the theme is one of the most key to the film, it should be explored a bit better. And also, the film is rather predictable from start to finish and implements some childish elements in to make it more of a Disney feature which drains elements of the serious nature of the film, such as the character Sheryl Yoast who really doesn't seem believable and feels thrown in there just so that the film has a child to add to its list of characters. \nAnd also, the drama within the plot elements seems rather scattered. While I enjoyed the drama and that it had a touch of comedy at times to lighten the mood, it didn't always feel like the drama had been as effective as it really should have been. The movie feels perhaps a little too light at times for a story which deals with such themes, and so as a drama Remember the Titans may be effective for young age groups without being too rough but is a little thin for the older crowds.\nBut aside from that, Remember the Titans is a successful film. It's largely a film about coaching, and coaching films don't tend to impress me as much as I'd hope. But Remember the Titans finds an important balance between the importance played by the coach and the actual team itself. Although it may not be as widely intelligent and interesting as it could be, as a sports film, it has a lot of heart and uplifting spirit to it which is where the importance lies.\nRemember the Titans is well written and is packed to the edge with a lot of interesting characters so that every plot dynamic the story goes through maintains various sources of interest. In Remember the Titans, you have to be able to remember that the importance comes from how the coach and the team work together, so a lot of what is interesting comes from the ways that the team members interact with each other throughout the film and its various plot dynamics. And thanks to the efforts of the cast, the characters are interesting enough.\nDenzel Washington is an actor who never lets me down, and Remember the Titans is no exception. His performance captures all the dedicated spirit necessary for the characterisation of Coach Herman Boone without going over the top. Denzel Washington's performance in Remember the Titans is a restrained one and in that manner it proves effective and inspiring, therefore having both Denzel Washington and Herman Boone essentially pay tribute to one another by putting Denzel Washington in the role.  Denzel Washington is the highlight of Remember the Titans, and it is his performance that will actually leave viewers remembering rhe Titans.\nWill Patton's performance is an effective one as well, because due to the strong way he interact with all the other actors in Remember the Titans, his role as Coach Bill Yoast is a fairly good one which pays the man the tribute he deserves. He's no Denzel Washington, but he's undeniably good.\nI'm never gonna forget Donald Faison for her performance as Chris Turk in Scrubs, so I was surprised when I saw him in Remember the Titans. But I was very enthralled because I think he's a great actor who is very talented as well as hilarious, and his performance in Remember the Titans was full of the same energy that he put into 9 seasons of Scrubs without going as far as putting a comedic focus on his character. He just puts a lot of charming spirit into his performance, and it makes the entire experience more enjoyable by playing a friendly figure. Donal Faison is a great addition to the cast in Remember the Titans.\nKip Pardue gave a meaningful and friendly performance as well, as did Ethan Suplee. And a young Ryan Gosling makes an appearance too which is good to see.\nLastly, Remember the Titans is well filmed and benefits from a strong soundtrack. Although some of the time the editing during football matches is rather quick, overall the visual experience is fairly good, thanks in part to a lot of quality scenery which has been shot on location.\n\nSo while Remember the Titans may be a bit light for its own good its sporting spirit and dedicated cast make it an uplifting look at American football that honours the titular team very well.",

In this 2000 film, Denzel Washington and Will Paton bring the movie to life with there amazing acting.\r\n\r\nThis film is a true story of a newly appointed African-American coach and his high school football team on their first season as a team with black members. This was during the time where blacks were discriminated against, so this team was not well thought of. This film had an original plot and kept me on my seat as it was hard for me to predict what was going to happen next.\r\n\r\nI think there was a theme or moral to this movie. Even though the Titans football team was a mix of black and white people, they overcame that and put there differences aside. I believe that there were 2 morals. 1.) To never give up, and 2.) No matter what skin color we are, we all belong to one human race and deserve to get along with one another.\r\n\r\nIn this film the camera work was excellent. Even when someone was talking for 30 seconds, the camera would slowly move up or tilt down. It was rare when the camera would just stay still. The camera work kept me interested in the film but was not so much as to where I was distracted from the movie.\r\n\r\nI loved this film. It is my favorite movie of all time. I would recommend this film to people who love sports, drama, or just being entertained. This film had joyful moments, sad moments, and even suspenseful moments where you could not tell what was going to happen next.\r\n\r\n-CE, 8th Grade Student",

The issues the film highlights, racism in a heated and old world town in the south during the early 70s, are raw and real. Though the subject matter is heavy, the characters feel real, real teenage boys on a real high school football team.

            "content": "Some movies are so inspirational that you stop what you are doing just to watch it. Disney's Remember the Titans (2000), directed by Boaz Yakin, is one of these movies for me. I remember the high school field trip to Virginia in 2002 when I first saw the movie. On the school bus ride home to New York, I am trying to do homework. However, Remember the Titans starts playing and I could not stop watching it. As with many Hollywood movies, it is loosely based on the true story of the desegregation of the school system in Alexandria, Virginia. In real life, three schools are integrated: George Washington, Hammond, and T.C. Williams high schools. In the movie, it is the integration of the black George Washington and the white T.C. Williams. While the film includes characters with the names of the actual players, much of the racial tensions and drama of the season is sensationalized for the movie. For an excellent breakdown of the parts of the movie that are fact or fiction, please go to http://www.chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/rememberthetitans.php. As such, the real life events are less exciting as there is no racial tension among the team and the football team dominated the season. Nevertheless, I agree with the use of creative license. While racial tensions may not exist for the football team in real life, including them in the movie helps reflect the climate of the era. Moreover, dramatic games in a sports movie are important for drama. As T.C. Williams is a dominant team, it would have been very boring to watch them take knees at the end of most blowout wins during their season. Remember the Titans does an excellent job addressing the issues of race and how an unifying force, like football, can bridge differences.\nIn addition, the cast is great. Denzel Washington is a great actor and fantastic as Coach Herman Boone. Will Patton is also brilliant as Coach Bill Yoast. Wood Harris is great as the best of the black players, defensive end Julius Campbell, and Ryan Hurst does an excellent job as the best of the white players, Gerry Bertier.  The cast for the rest of the team is fantastic and are a great group of characters. The film also includes future stars in Ryan Gosling, Kate Bosworth, and a very young Hayden Panetierre. Hayden is the most memorable of the supporting characters as Coach Yoast's tomboy daughter, Sheryl. She is a diehard football fan. In one scene, she is passionately debating strategy with Coach Boone. When Coach Yoast comes into the scene, Boone asks \"Why don't you get this little girl some pretty dolls or something, Coach?\" In response, Yoast answers \"I tried. She loves football\". Moreover, her temper tantrums and frustration when plays go against the Titans during the movie are hilarious. While the rest of the cast are great characters, the movie is driven by Coach Boone, Coach Yoast, Julius Campbell, and Gerry Bertier. Moreover, the film is defined by the relationships between the two coaches as well as the best players, Julius and Gerry.\n\nFor my full review, please go to http://rookerville.com/2013/08/27/retrospective-review-remember-titans/?fb_source=pubv1",

The story is truly great and there are some funny moments in the movie as well. I HIGHLY recommend this movie. It is incredible.",

It was inspirational, true to the time, and even.\r\n\r\nPLOT:In 1971 Virginia, three high schools are forced to integrate with one being black and the other two being white. The football coaches of two of the schools, long-time favorite, Coach Yoats (Will Patton), and new-comer, Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) agree to try and combine their teams and integrate their players to form the almighty Titans. It's not easy, however; the players constantly fight each other and the town's racist mind's often interfere. However, they can pull through with a loving heart and a strong mind. It's a good plot executed fairly well. \r\n\r\nACTING:The performances in here were great. Denzel Washington played the best of them as the wise and forceful Coach Boone. Will Patton also played a pretty decent part as Coach Yoates. In some places, I could see where he could've done better, but he did well overall. The other shiners were Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier, Craig Kirkwood as The Rev, Kip Pardue as Sunshine, Donald Faison as Petey, Wood Harris as Julius, and Hayden Pentierre as Sheryl Yoast. \r\n\r\nSCORE:The score was mainly songs from the time period mixed withe some inspirational themes. It wasn't too bad. \r\n\r\nOTHER CONTENT:I thought this was just going to be another cheesy inspirational movie, but I was proved wrong. This was a little cheesy and inspirational, but it did everything right. It balanced the humor and drama with the performances evenly to tell the story true to the time period. I appreciate how accurate (from what I've studied) they depicted the time. Though this still was cheesy in places as well as predictable, it played its cards right and remained fairly even throughout. \r\n\r\nOVERALL,a good movie with a good plot, great acting, alright score, even tonal balances, accuracy to the time, and lots of inspiration, but it was still a bit cheesy and predictable.",
