Also, this film has a much more developed storyline and actually deals with the origins of the two main families.\n\nWilma runs away from her snobby rich family and her associates, and winds up in a diner meeting Betty, a waitress working there. Shortly after, they meet Fred and Barney, and during their double date, Fred is with Betty and Barney is with Wilma, but shortly afterward the couples switch partners. Also, Gazoo the alien appears to them, doing a study of human mating rituals, and he tags along with them, though he is an annoyance to Fred and the others.\n\nBut the casino they patronize is run by a ex-boyfriend of Wilma's who wants to marry Wilma-not for love, but for access to her family's money. He tries to sabotage the relationship between Fred and Wilma-will he succeed? Ironically, while the original movie was a hit, this one wasn't, even though it improved on the original. Too bad they couldn't have made animated versions instead.",

And why did Hollywood put all their chips on Alan Cumming at the turn of the century? No one won from that bet\u2026including Cumming.",

            "content": "A really unnecessary prequel to The Flintstones (1994), but one that has some decent things about it. The movie is about Fred Flinstone (Mark Addy) and Barney Rubble (Stephen Baldwin) who are visited by The Great Gazoo (Alan Cumming). This is about as random as a plot as we can get. Gazoo has been sent to Earth to learn about the earthlings mating rituals. Only Fred and Barney can see him and truthfully he doesn't even need to be in this movie. Also the effects to show him look very very bad. Anyways Fred and Barney one day get some food and run into Berry O'Shale (Jane Krakowski) and Wilma Slaghoople (Kristen Johnston). Wilma has run away from her lavish live in Slaghoople manor and is currently living with Betty. The four of them decide to go on a double date and both basically come out of it with their respective partners. Wilma brings her new found friends to her family for her father Colonel Slaghoople's (Harvey Korman) birthday where Fred meet's Wilmas ex-boyfriend Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson). Chip invited them all to his new casino opening in Rock Vegas. Fred agrees they should go with hopes of winning enough money to buy Wilma a proper ring and propose to her. The four of them go, but meanwhile Chip is actually the puppet master here planning to get Wilma back and get rid of Fred. There's a bit more to it all, but that's the jist of it. So yeah the plot is basically an origin story of how Fred and Barney met Wilma and Betty. Why they added the Gazoo plotline I have no idea. Looks like they just wanted to make more references to the cartoon. The film does actually have some funny moments and some adult jokes in it like the previous one which I actually laughed out loud at. I will say Mark Addy is definitely no John Goodman. He's sufficient, but he just is kinda missing something here as Fred. I thought Stephen Baldwin was a good Barney and I even liked Jane Krakowski as Betty. I think Kristen Johnson as Wilma was miscast. She's very much out of place in this movie and while she's trying her best I think they could have gone with someone else of this role. Definitely, a forgettable film. If you have to watch one terrible Flintstones movie might as well just stick to the original (as I said previously I think it's a decent flick). This one's also streaming on HBO for anyone curious.",

Additionally, the Great Gazoo is introduced; a small green alien with superpowers who no one but Fred and Barney can see.  The plot is just terrible, hitting every bad rom-com clich\u00e9 and trope in the book.  And the caveman jokes are incredibly lame.  Also, the casting is awful; particularly Kristen Johnston as Wilma.  Humorless dreck, The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas is an insult to Flintstone fans everywhere.",
