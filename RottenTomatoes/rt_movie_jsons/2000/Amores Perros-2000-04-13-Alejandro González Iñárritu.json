Inventively structured as a triptych of overlapping and intersecting narratives, \"Amores Perros\" explores the lives of disparate characters who are catapulted into unforeseen dramatic situations instigated by the seemingly inconsequential destiny of a dog named Cofi.",

I missed the disclosure at the beginning about no animals being hurt while making this and wrongly assumed they'd gotten away with it because they'd filmed in another country, adding a heavy dose of pure dismay to my viewing experience. The supermodel section of the story was the weakest of the movie (I didn't feel that the dog getting stuck under the house was a big deal really), but compared to the next two movies in the trilogy I think they did a better job here at blending the disparate tales together and making them all compelling in their own way. The best part for me was the sustained level of violence and suffering across the three stories; even when they weren't hurting the dogs I kept feeling like at any moment the older brother might barge into the scene and start wrecking stuff!",

The themes we see are \"Dogs and disloyalty\", \"Inequality\" and \"Violence\". It\u00b4s violent, emotional and difficult film.

It's a film about compassion, friendship, exploitation, and class struggle, all told with equal parts of sensitivity and brutality.  It is the brutality that will turn a lot of viewers away as the catalyst for so much of what happens is a fighting dog called Cofi, an animal that leaves a graphic trail of blood and viscera in its wake. The handheld camerawork can be dizzying at times, but this was no doubt Inarritu's intent.  The compelling stories, dialogue, and characters make Amores Perros memorable and harrowing viewing.",

I'll be honest, the individual parts aren't necessarily seamless, but that doesn't mean that they aren't powerful. Loyalty (or the lack thereof) is a key theme throughout the film, as I\u00f1\u00e1rritu probes potential motivations for his human (and famously loyal canine) characters to act in certain ways. Though marked by a penchant for violence, the plot is particularly character-driven, as plot points force difficult decisions upon different individuals, with the director using these \"boil-over\" moments to demonstrate an underlying cruelty and penchant for cruelty, often as a means of base desires such as revenge or self-preservation. A dark tale that makes full use of the societal divisions prevalent in Mexico (brought together by a single sporadic moment, but which otherwise would have remained separate), though perhaps with some rough edges around where the stories meet.\n\nAfter all the depressing turns of events, animal abuse, and physical and mental devastation in this movie, it might be Echevarr\u00eda cutting his nails with scissors that made me wince the most. (4/5)",

I think every story and batch of characters presented in the story are interesting and different, but I found myself most thoroughly engaged with the first story the movie presented.

I believe the first 5 minutes are devoted to showing the inner workings of a dog-fighting establishment, and I instantly wanted to shut the movie off. I have a serious soft spot for dogs, and I\u2019ve been a dog owner myself for a little over a year (she\u2019s like my baby, since I have no kids of my own.) So, to turn on a film that shows such realistic dog-fighting made me a little sick to my stomach. While the end credits claimed they didn\u2019t hurt any of the dogs, it\u2019s hard for me to buy that. Even if they did find a way to simulate the dog-fighting without actually letting the animals rip each other apart, they at least created a fair amount of real rage in these animals that could be just as dangerous in the long run. I don\u2019t want to give the false impression that I\u2019m some PETA wacko who wants to throw paint on your fur coats, in fact I understood the dog-murder as a plot device in John Wick and never complained about that choice. However, that doesn\u2019t mean I want to watch such brutally violent treatment of animals in a movie. In fact, even the second and third acts of this movie continued the ugly mistreatment of dogs to a degree that I started to wonder if I\u00f1\u00e1rritu hates dogs. Amores Perros is a movie that looks like it is about three intersecting stories, but in reality, it\u2019s about three totally separate stories that only have a small tangential relationship to one-another. I found all of them unpleasant, and most of the people in them to be even more unpleasant. There weren\u2019t real protagonists or antagonists, instead there was just all the awful stuff that happened to them. I can get on board with a movie that tells the same story from multiple viewpoints, but these are not the same story. All these people are dealing with their own struggles, and at best we get a person from the previous story hanging in the background. I was most put off by the first act of the film, because that\u2019s where the dog-fighting occurs. The second act was just as frustrating for me as the last one. I could not understand the characters\u2019 logic for handling their problems, and I didn\u2019t care much about the crumbling adulterous relationship. Finally, the last story just puzzled me, because it didn\u2019t have a solid resolution. Needless to say, Amores Perros was a somewhat painful experience for me to watch, and I hope to never sit through that again.",

The story is filled with infinite sadness, but leaves one with the feeling of true life authenticity, of having touched some things personal in my own life.

The title translation is Love's A Bitch. Set in Mexico City, it tells three interlocking stories - connected around a gruesome car accident - about violence perpetrated by man and dog. The first segment involves a young man (Gael Garcia Bernal) who wants to use money earned from dog fighting to run away with his sister-in-law (Vanessa Bauche), who he is in love with; the second segment is about a beautiful model (Goya Toledo), incapacitated after being injured in a car accident, and how her relationship with a married man begins to unravel; the final story is about an assassin (Emilio Echevarria), hired by a business man to murder his partner, who begins to regret his life and the loss of the daughter he abandoned. The violence is graphic but never exploitive - even the dogfights are judiciously edited - and we are always made aware of the consequences. Shot using hand-held cameras with a grainy, slightly bleached out color scheme by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto that gives the locations a seedy reality. Inarritu overlaps scenes and plays with continuity in a manner that suggests \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Before the Rain.\" Written by Guillermo Arriaga. In Spanish with English subtitles.",

I\u00f1\u00e1rritu had not mastered (or chose not to use) the single take approach here and so that is conspicuously absent in a film where at times, it feels almost necessary. Absent as well is the exceptional (and expensive) camera work of The Revenant, with Amores Perros grounding itself in low budget shots that work for the most part but can occasionally be too choppy, too grimy, or simply too poorly done even for the film's arthouse tastes. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's storyboarding also falls short of his work with Birdman, although this may reflect his greater involvement with the writing of that later film. Although the first and last storyline of the film are powerful, the central sequence feels underwhelming, both in importance and connection to the other characters, despite moving performances from the actors involved. It's a letdown quickly solved in the third act but it's also another hour added onto what is already an overly long film, another issue that I\u00f1\u00e1rritu would address with later films by tidying up the narratives (Birdman runs at only 119 minutes) or engaging the audience more effectively throughout (The Revenant as a case in point). However despite all of this, Amores Perros is a fantastically engaging character study, in the tradition of Tarantino. It's also a film that shares a stylistic structure with films like Requiem for a Dream and Crash but as regretful Oscar voters can likely attest to, Amores Perros will probably give you a better feel for that style then those other two atrocities ever will. It's impressive because despite seeming like a television episode needing several more seasons (this is apparently part of a loosely connected trilogy, although the fact that the other two films start mostly white actors seems to strike against what made this film interesting for me), Amores Perros manages, for the most part, to keep you engaged on its own terms, despite not really having much of a significant resolution, climax, or narrative goal. Everything has small endings certainly but since the film is part of a larger story, most is left unfinished but remarkably, doesn't lose engagement. Most importantly however, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu showcases, for the first time, his incredible affinity for human emotion and drama along with the beginnings of the unique storytelling abilities that would catapult him to the Academy's highest honors with Birdman. Although Amores Perros is certainly the seeds of better works and will not be for everyone, for those film fans looking to engage with one of Hollywood's best living directors and his filmmaking roots, this movie is his actual start and it's a good one.",

            "content": "Sometimes great cinema is not always based on things that are easy to watch and digest. Ameros Perros is such movie where the viewer will get to witness painful things and through that pain come the art of realization. Maybe there is no other pleasant way to tell this story without making it less effective. Whichever it is the final result is a staggering piece of true cinema.\n\nAmores Perros is directed by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, and is the first movie of the death trilogy followed by 21 Grams (2003) and Babel (2006). Though there is no relativity in plot between these movies the sublime and underlying similarity in style of storytelling is what binds them together. Here in Amores Perros there are 3 parallel story lines that seem very different to each other on surface but speak of a common theme all together. And at one point the characters of each story line overlaps and meets ones another at a common symbolic incident. This incident is what binds the stories together however not largely dependent on each other's success. This is one reason I called this point symbolic than crucial.\n\nStory line one follows the most painful to watch material. It's about a young man from the city low class who turns to fighting his dog in underground dog fights to earn money for his plans to get away with his unconventional girlfriend.  Here you may come across the ugly trade of dog fights and the fate of dogs that goes in to them. For dog lovers this section is nightmare. Story line two is about a super model who faces an unfortunate road accident. The drama between her illegal partner and her struggle to survive takes a very different mood and rhythm from the previous story. Yet she also has a pet dog that keeps her company. The key character of storyline three is a hit man. Beaten up by life and mistakes he did in the past he lives with a bunch of dogs and almost homeless. However he struggles to put things right by his daughter and for some reasons he is pushed away from his dreams.\n\n\nAs you may realize these three storylines are far from being common. But they are beautifully connected by dogs. The dog is a symbol of loyalty at each story and the people are symbols of disloyalty and unfaithfulness. This combination works perfectly and Amores Perros gives the viewer heavy breathing. Powerful performances, wonderful cinematography and music ads spice on top of each other without making a single story lines prominent over each other. It seems like the director has done a perfect job in phasing out the sequences and laying out a perfect ending as well. While I highly recommend this I would like to recommend 21 Grams and Babel too if you have not seeing them already. They complete one of the most satisfying trilogies of contemporary cinema.",

            "content": "*Thumbs Up!*\n\nWarning, if you love dogs and hate to see them get harmed in any fashion, stay away from this film.  You'll regret it sorely.  Amores Perros is my first stop on Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's trilogy of death.  It is the first film of the trilogy.  The others are 21 Grams and Babel, which I'm highly anticipating since this film was amazing.  The film is often referred to as the Mexican version of Pulp Fiction, and I can definitely see where the line is met.  Both films are told in non-linear functions while also switching to a different story.  However, I think it resembles more of a Crash-esque feel, due to the fact that it's all connected through an accident.  However, unlike the very moronic Crash, Amores Perros is not an exercise to sit through.\n\n3 people's lives all connect through one car accident.  Octavio, a middle classman who falls to the clutches of infidelity, lives in an apartment with his brother.  He loves his brother's wife and begins an affair.  They plot on running away with each other and leave Octavio's brother behind.  However, Octavio doesn't have enough money to provide the escape.  With his back against the wall, Octavio falls into the deep ring of dog fighting.  In another part of Mexico, Daniel abandons his family to be with a model named Valeria.  All is going great until Valeria loses her leg in a car accident.  Soon, Valeria is beginning to lose her beauty, scaring Daniel.  In another part of Mexico, there is a homeless man by the name of El Chivo.  He is hired to hunt down and kill a man for money.  However, he is interrupted by a car accident.  All 3 stories are interconnected through this, and that is their only connection.\n\nDirector Alejandro Inarritu is the true star of this film, mainly due to the shots he creates during this film.  He definitely took a couple lessons from Tarantino while having a hint of Pasolini thrown into the shots.  The world he creates in this film is dark, brutal, and very depressing.  It may affect viewers who have a soft spot for dogs very much because, well, many dogs die throughout the film.  The many dogs' death felt very realistic.  It attracted a pretty huge controversy over the very realistic deaths.  If it's any consolation to those who watch, the dogs were not killed.  Though the soft hearted ones might not fare well with this, those willing to watch will be amazed.  In hindsight, this film is not much of a disrespectful view of life, but rather, a statement that life should be celebrated.  The three characters El Chivo, Octavio, and Valeria are all 3 very different people.  El Chivo represents the lower class of Mexico.  Octavio represents the middle class.  And Valeria is the upper class.  There is severe segregation throughout the country, separating all 3 of them from actually interacting.  If it weren't for the accident, they would never meet.  The upperclass is victimized in Amores Perros even when they are the ones perpetuating crime, for instance, El Chivo is hired to kill a man's business partner and eventually decides to leave both men to fight it out themselves. Although Ramiro works at a grocery store, he also participates in the underground economy by committing robberies. Octavio, and El Chivo participate in the underground Mexican economy as well, in order to secure untaxed income and bring stability to their lives.\n\nAmores Perros is a strange, strange film indeed.  And the dog fighting sequences are pretty tough to sit through at times, especially with the brutal realism.  However, what really drives this film home is the focus on characters over plot.  Now, I love when films have great stories, but if they have useless characters, then I can't get into the film.  Props to Guillermo Arriaga Jordan for the script because this film truly wouldn't have been good if someone else wrote it.  All the characters were tragic in their own sense.  Octavio, who I felt the most sorrow for, loved the woman he had, only to be wronged by her.  Inarritu, rather than telling you, shows you the terrible consequences of infidelity.  He doesn't restrain anything back and while the message is handed heavily, it works for the best in the end.  It works mainly cause if you handle tough material with too much care *cough* Crash *cough*, it comes off terribly.  \n\nOverall, Amores Perros is a very brutal, realistic film.  Dog lovers or people with weak stomachs better stay away because it can get a little too rough at times.  However, with all the Hollywood BS that we've been given for the past decade, we need a little gritty film, with no restraints.  The film is masterfully shot by Inarritu.  I really hope 21 Grams and Babel can live up to the high standard set by this film.  The script from Guillermo Jordan is wonderful, creating tragic and likable characters.  The acting was great all around, especially Gael Garcia Bernal's portrayal of Octavio.  It gives off a Pulp Fiction feel, only if Pulp Fiction was more realistic.  That's not to say Pulp Fiction sucks or is inferior to this film because it isn't.  It's actually the opposite of that.  While feeling unfortunately inferior to Tarantino's film and to some of Pasolini's, Amores Perros provides us with a great addition to thesse non-linear films.",

            "content": "Amores Perros is a brutal, unflinching, and gripping crime drama that is not for the faint of heart or people who whine about films being too depressing or too dark. It's a film that depicts the dark underbelly of a criminal underworld, the differing human perspectives in such an environment, and the companionship between humans and their dogs. It's an unusual combination, but an absolutely brilliant film was churned out from these elements. It also happens to be one of the best films of the 21st century.\n\nThe story is anthology comprised of three stories that are connected by a horrific car crash that forever alters the lives of the characters.\n\nOctavio y Susana\n\nThis particular story focuses on a man named Octavio who lives at home with his mother, his brother, Ramiro, his sister-in-law, Susana, and an infant. Octavio has no real prospects in life, but is in love with Susana, and resents the way his brother treats her.\n\nHowever, things take a strange turn when Ramiro's dog, Cofi, wanders away from home and ends up killing the dog owned by a dangerous gangster involved in the underground sport of dog fighting, after the gangster tries to sic his dog on Cofi.\n\nWith the gangster demanding money and seeing possible ways to make money so that he can leave with Susana, Octavio and his friend, Jorge, become involved in dog fighting, which proves to be quite successful and lucrative as Cofi is quite good at fighting.\n\nBut being involved in the criminal underworld comes with consequences and shady dealings that can go wrong at any time. Plus, Susana is always sending mixed messages to him, which leads to further issues, on top of his brother beginning to suspect Octavio's feelings for his wife.\n\nDaniel y Valeria\n\nThe second story focuses on a couple who recently hooked up after Daniel left his wife and children for Valeria, a successful model from Spain. As they prepare for their new lives together, things take a dramatic change when Valeria is severely injured in a car accident, which leaves her in a wheelchair and threatens to destroy her modeling career.\n\nOn top of that, her precious dog, Richie, decides to crawl into a hole in the floor of their apartment and will not come out. Meanwhile, the couple's relationship begins to deteriorate from all these events, while they are both tormented by the scratching noises under the floorboards as Richie continues to wander aimlessly beneath them.\n\nEl Chivo y Maru\n\nThe final story focuses on a man known as El Chivo, who wanders the streets looking like a homeless man with several stray dogs in tow. The man is a former school teacher who became involved in a guerrilla group that landed him in prison for 20 years. His daughter, Maru, was taught to believe that he was dead, while El Chivo's wife died shortly after his release. Now he works as a hitman who lives in squalor, while trying to make contact with his estranged daughter.\n\nHe is hired by a man to kill his business partner, and as he prepares to carry out the hit, things take a strange turn when he witnesses a major car accident. When he goes to the scene, he tries to aid the male driver (Octavio) and then steals his wallet when the emergency workers arrive, and rescues a severely injured dog from the backseat (Cofi), who has a bullet wound.\n\nHe takes Cofi into his care and helps him recover, while he plots out how he will take out his target. However, the introduction of Cofi into his life induces life-changing revelations as El Chivo sees elements of himself in Cofi and reflects on his life's decisions.\n\nClocking in at 2 hours, 53 minutes, Amores Perros has a wealth of dramatic depth to offer in its 3 stories. It was interesting to see people from all walks of life as they handled the dangerous environment around them, and how a single event can induce massive changes in the lives of so many people. \n\nIt's a superb tale of love, greed, companionship, crime, and human nature all rolled into one superb, mesmerizing film. There is not a single dull moment, and not a single moment that rings falsely or drowns the viewer in schmaltz. It's a brutal and harsh film. It's a story of multiple character studies and they are all developed and feel very alive and very human.\n\nThe acting across the board is stellar, especially from Gael Bernal Garcia as Octavio, Goya Toledo as Valeria, and Emilio Echevarria as El Chivo. These 3 leads stole the show with their distinct characters and styles they conveyed. Garcia conveys unrequited love, foolhardy greed, but also conveys a level of sympathetic naivety as he tries to make the best of his situation in such a harsh environment. Toledo conveys spoiled model, but also beautifully conveys torment as her world crumbles around her. Echevarria proved to be rather enigmatic, fascinating, and dangerous in his portrayal. My words will never do these performances justice - you need to see the film and experience their greatness.\n\nNeedless to say, I was glued to my seat for the entire running time. There is so much for a fan of drama to sink their teeth into with this film because of the depth of the 3 stories and the well developed characters that inhabit this frightening and dangerous city. It's got crime, it's got romance, it's got relationship troubles, it has themes about companionship with dogs, and so much more. You're always going to be eager for whatever comes forth, voraciously devouring every detail.\n\nAmores Perros is a masterwork of a crime drama. It's brutal and unpleasant, but also very deep and resonant at the same time. It's superbly directed, very engaging, well written, superbly performed, and very visceral and evocative. It packs one hell of a punch, and I highly recommend it to fans of crime dramas.",

Today they are all directing big budget movies in Hollywood, but it wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for this gem of a movie that put Mexican cinema in the international map again. Gael Garcia Bernal was also a revelation in this film and has become a well known actor after his performance here and in Y Tu Mama Tambien. Having watched I\u00f1arritu's later films, 21 Grams and Babel, I kind of knew what to expect from Amores Perros. He has a way of interconnecting several stories and playing with linear chronological events, and Amores Perros seems to be the film that started this trait. I wish I would've seen this film before the others because this feels like a more complete film, but I have grown a bit tired of the director's stylish and depressing vision of the world. This is still a great film with some powerful scenes, although the movie does suffer from being a little too long (150 minutes) and I thought one of the stories (Valeria and Daniel's) wasn't up to the same level of the other two and I could have done without it. Having said that I still believe this is one of his best films and definitely Mexico's best film. It deserves all the awards it has received and should've won an Oscar for best foreign picture if it didn't have to compete against Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The script from Guillermo Arriaga was also gripping and realistic. In my opinion I\u00f1arritu's best work has been done alongside Arriaga.\n\nThe film centers on three interconnected stories that overlap with each other in a terrible car accident. The first story focuses on Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) and his sister-in-law Susana (Vanessa Bauche), with whom he's secretly in love. His brother, Ramiro (Marco Perez) treats her terribly, but Octavio promises to take care of her if she runs away with him. In order to make money, Octavio gets involved with dog fighting, since his dog happens to be a great fighter. When one of the dog fights goes wrong, Octavio has to escape from a group of gang leaders that eventually cause the traffic accident. The second story (and my least favorite one) centers on the relationship between a successful model, Valeria (Goya Toledo) and magazine editor named Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero) who has abandoned his family to live with her. And finally the third story introduces us to a bum named El Chivo (Emilio Echeverr\u00eda) who also works as a contracted killer. All these characters also seem to have special relationships with their dogs. \n\nAs the title suggests dogs do play a very important role in this film, not only because the accident is produced in the first place due to a dog fight, but because I\u00f1arritu compares the violence in dog fights with the brutality and savagery of humanity. There are several themes and layers to this film, but I\u00f1arritu knows his craft and delivers a very brutal and realistic film. Amores Perros is an ambitious movie with several scenes that will stick with you and some powerful performances from Gael Garcia Bernal and Emilio Echeverr\u00eda. I\u00f1arritu is very familiar with the brutality in human nature and isn't afraid to show the dark side of humanity along with the search for true love. Amores Perros is an emotionally involving movie with a gripping humanistic story, but I think I\u00f1arritu should shift gears for his next movie and focus on another aspect of humanity instead. This film was fresh and innovative, but his tricks have grown old after 21 Grams, Babel, and Biutiful. \n\nRating: 8,5/10",

            "content": "An astonishing film from Mexican director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, \"Amores Perros\" packs a complex emotional wallop that rivals \"Traffic\" or Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\" -- and the fact that it's I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's first film makes it even more remarkable. Its dark and disturbing--an almost surrealist tone that escalates it high above the usual film laced with carnage. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu doesn't present Mexico City as a tourist attraction with exotic locales. Written by Guillermo Arriaga, the film lies in the belly of the underworld--a rat's-eye view of a city undergoing economic upheaval. The political angle doesn't exactly leap off the screen, and it doesn't have to. But circumstances are dire--an environment where only the strong survive. \r\n\r\nStructured as a triptych, \"Amores Perros\" opens with a speeding car racing through the streets. Its backseat cargo is a wounded dog -- not the last you'll see, either. Its driver is a shrieking mess of blood, sweat and tears. His name is Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal), and his car is making a getaway from a dogfight gone deadly. But before we get a whiff of what precipitated it, there's a crash. A narrative rewind then takes us back a few days, to when Octavio has hatched a plan to run off with his brother's girlfriend. \"Amores Perros\" interlaces three distinct tales around this single event, and then plays fast and loose with structure and narrative to fill in the befores and afters. \r\n\r\nThere's slum kid Octavio (Bernal), who, with a friend, enters his hulking rottweiler Cofi in the local dog fights. He's also in love with his abusive brother Ramiro's (P\u00e9rez) wife (Bauche), and begs her to come away with him to the coast to open up a storefront using his dog fight winnings. Then there's the gorgeous model Valeria (Toledo) and her magazine editor lover Daniel (Guerrero) -- the aforementioned car crash acts as a terrible proving ground (for better or worse) for their romance. Finally, there's a disheveled vagrant -- El Chivo, the goat -- played by legendary Mexican character actor Echevarr\u00eda, who collects the city's homeless canines and occasionally moonlights as a hitman. \r\n\r\n\"Amores Perros\" at 154 minutes is a heavy, prolonged story-- rich with characters and atmosphere. His characters are people with feelings and motives. They want love, money, and revenge. They not only love their dogs--but desperately depend on them. And it is clear that the lower classes are better at survival than the wealthy, whose confidence comes from their possessions, not their fortitude. It is the work of a born filmmaker-- you can sense his passion as he plunges into melodrama, coincidence, sensation, and violence.\r\n\r\n\"Amores Perros\" has much more going on in its multi-layered plot--but the less viewers know going in, the better off they're likely to be. Forewarning however: The film's portrayal of the brutal world of back alley dogfighting, and a way of life in their culture, is utterly realistic, appalling, and difficult to watch. Those averse to the sight of dead and dying canines should at the very least be prepared to cover their eyes. As with everything else in his film, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's camera doesn't flinch from the mundane cruelties of the street. Entirely apart from the remarkable narrative, \"Amores Perros\" is a triumph on virtually every conceivable front. Rodriego Prieto's cinematography is unique to each storyline.\r\n\r\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu feverishly works to earn the existentialist melodrama that closes the film. He's daring you: Can you see beneath life's luridness? Admittedly, this violent, ruthless film is not going to be to everyone's taste. But for those willing to submit to its unrelenting misery, will be rewarded substantially.",
