            "content": "I have to say... I really think the critics were completely unfair to Urban Legends: Final Cut, the 2000 sequel to Urban Legend. I can easily imagine them seeing a sequel to a mediocre slasher, with such a corny subtitle, and not giving it a chance at all.\n\nI actually liked it a lot. It's definitely better than I Still Remember What You Did Last Summer, and I liked it better than the first Urban Legend, too. I'd even say it's better than Scream 3.\n\nThe Scream movies get love for all the pop culture references and commentary, dialogue about the \"rules\" of horror films, extended sequences of Carpenter's Halloween being watched by characters, etc, and I Know What You Did Last Summer also plays to the urban legend thing.\n\nBut Urban Legends: Final Cut both directly addresses and also applies the elements that make great films. I don't hear people talking about mise-en-scene in a Wes Craven movie. I really loved the framing and the camera work in UL: Final Cut. It has great lighting and mood. And I love Jennifer Morrison, so that helps too. It also had a few kills that were more clever, I thought, than anything in the Scream or Last Summer franchises.\n\nI have a strong suspicion that the subtitle was NOT the choice of the director. It just doesn't fit with the impression I get from the filmwork, and I can easily believe a dumb shit studio executive slapped it on there because they thought it was \"edgy\". You should give this one a chance!",

While some may see this as a good thing, this still is an R-rated film, but it didn't even try to earn the rating, feeling more like a television show at times. It had the same budget as the first, but it seems as though they spent it on keeping the elaborate sets rather than some good deaths. Also, the plot is fairly clever by using film students as the victims, but it strays away from urban legends as the MO, and the motive is just awful and barely becomes clear by the end. The performances don't speak for much either, Anderson and Devine probably being the most entertaining. While it certainly wasn't the worst sequel I've seen, it was far from being a good one.",

An art student working on her thesis film about urban legends finds that her crew is slowly being picked off one-by-one by a mysterious killer.  The script is terrible, particularly the weak and uninteresting urban legends that it uses.  And, the film itself is incredibly pretentious with all its metaphors about film.  Urban Legends: Final Cut is a barely coherent film that has no real scares to it.",

Which just makes it all the more annoying when nothing original or clever happens the entire time and the ending, far from being a twist, is a mangled rat's nest of uninspired end tying.
