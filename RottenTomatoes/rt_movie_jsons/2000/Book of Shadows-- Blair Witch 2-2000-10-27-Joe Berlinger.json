    "summary": "As it follows the twisted path traveled by five people fixated on \"The Blair Witch Project,\" \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" journeys into a dark and dangerous place where the line between truth and fiction blurs and perhaps vanishes altogether. Individual perception grows increasingly untrustworthy as the film's protagonists find themselves caught in a vortex of unspeakable evil, the origins of which -- human or supernatural -- remain chillingly uncertain.",

            "content": "I love how meta this movie is, pre-dating the concept of \"meta\" by at least a decade or longer. This movie focuses on a group of fans of the original Blair Witch movie (a fake documentary, but real in this movie) who travel to the very real town of Burkittsville, Maryland to catch a glimpse of the Blair Witch. From there the movie dives into full-on psychological horror, leaving the characters and you the audience member questioning what's real and what's fake. Overall, the movie's cheesy, but fun.",

Instead of being a thrilling and horrifying found footage movie, like its predecessor, this sequel is more like student-made pseudo-intellectual fan fiction. It's wandered so far off the path of where the first film was, that it becomes almost unrecognizable as part of the original story. This horror flick tries to be so deep in all of its references and editing and cinematography, but it all comes off as pretentious and gratuitous. Book of Shadows was a waste of my time and a sequel I hope to soon forget.",

While the Blair Witch Project was controversial/divisive movie, people cannot deny its significance in movie pop culture and because it made twelve hundred times its budget back so naturally a sequel was inevitable. Director Joe Berlinger had the promising idea of making the sequel a satirical psychological thriller and the studio seemed intrigued by the idea and greenlit the sequel. Unfortunately, the studio did a complete 180 and wanted straight up supernatural horror film and as a result the script was change. As a result, it left a horrendously butchered experience of a film as the movie is left with nothing but a confusing story with huge plot holes, clueless directing, and scenes that led to nowhere. (For example, A group of tourists the run into the protagonists were there to show the global obsession of the first film, only for the studio to mandate they get brutally murder by the protagonists just to have some slasher gore.) As result the film was horribly panned by critics and left 16-year gap in terms of sequels. Fans have been hoping for director's cut to be released but as it stands the movie is an incomprehensible mess.",

It is sort of making the first one a joke. when they tried to redeem them selves in the 3rd one they got it all wrong. butt again we could just blame book of shadows for making the 3rd Blair witch not scary and bad. they made book of shadows into a more adult version of Scooby do. But I have to admit it was fun in some places. if this was not linked to Blair witch I would of given a rating of more like three stars. but as hard as you try you just can't like this movie. as a Blair witch fan I am disappointed. if movie were better Blair witch would be no doubt the best horror movies. witch brings me to horror. this is not a horror movie! the dead children part is just not scary. any way half the movie is not set in the woods. when Kim goes to the store to bye beer that dose is when I new What I was in for. In the first blah witch when there in the woods they do not come back out and adding a Tristan who goes mad dose not make it any better. It was a attempt of mocking Michael going mad in the first one. Tristan went mad about nothing. the child part was from I would think the noses out Side the tent in the first. there were children playing. I think what also ruins book of shadows is that you see the ghosts. what makes the first really good is that you can only hear and not see. In the 3rd Blair witch you see the ghosts as well witch is why that Blair witch is not popular as well. even through It is not the Blair witch it still ruins the point. after saying that I would not watch It. I will do a review on the other Blair witches as well butt My points are the same on the third 'do not watch It'. that is all I have to say",

I can't possibly imagine how this film could be fixed. Jeffrey Donovan's the only decent actor in the cast, but he's playing a character that doesn't fit him at all. Who buys his action hero self as a stoner, ne'er do well tour guide? The plot is recycled and silly. It feels like one of those Hellraiser sequels that started as something else and then they shoe-horned Pinhead (or in this case the Blair Witch) in to get views.",

Waiting for her tour group in a cemetary lying down on a grave? Yes she was a misfit but she was a good person and knew how to stand up for herself when the local grocery store with a low gene pool didn't like her kind shopping at their store: \"Hi Peggy, can you please tell the (b - t c h) at the counter to do her G Damn job and ring up the customer?\" It's such a classic line I absolutely love and feel other people wish they could tell that to rude employees as well!  And then there is the hot Wiccan girl that was not only hot but intelligent in the Wiccan ways and came on the tour to personally talk to the dead blair witch lady. Yes she is not your typical main stream person either but neither am I and that is why I just love this person!  Finally we have the couple researchers, they were probably the most normal of the bunch but I would love to talk to them about their research on the Blair Witch, I know I would make friends with them very easily!!! Oh to be young again and hang out with some misfit millennial youths, that is what life is all about and in case you are wondering? The doctors probably let me out a little too early too!!! ;) Watch the movie and let me know if these people ever go on a tour again, call me and I promise you I will be the first one in the van!!!",

There was not much I can say this movie has going for it - except for maybe the fact that it tried to be more eventful than the original. The plot of this movie is just a mess, these people go looking for the Blair Witch, which, once again we learn absolutely nothing about, and slowly see themselves get terrorized by the witch, similar to what happened in the first movie. There was a twist that this movie tried to throw in, which I have to say was probably the most interesting thing that happened in this movie, and I can't really complain about that because at least they tried to do something other than leach off of the first movies success. There is so much wrong with this movie, even the title doesn't make any sense. There is no \"Book Of Shadows\" in this movie, nor is there any mention of a book of shadows, no reference, not even a book that could resemble a book of shadows. This movie should have just been called \"Blair Witch 2\", but I guess the producers scrapped the plot entirely for the \"Book Of Shadows\" and just made up some new crap and threw it out. Everything from the way this movie was shot, to the acting, to the actual plot just screams lazy, and although I could see \"The Blair Witch Project\" being good in 1999, I know for a fact that there is no time where this sequel would be anything better than just a trashy movie looking to make a quick buck off of the original movie's success. \"Book Of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" is terrible.",

In fact, what was up with that opening with the pouring of the mucus into his nose? They never explained that. Hey, how come they saw crazy images sometimes and then didn't at other times? Was there ever a rhyme or reason to it, or did they just do it out of nowhere? For that matter, how do we know the video footage is really what we're seeing? I mean, is that really what happened, or did the ghost or witch or whatever it is play with that, too? We saw clearly he can mess with the footage. Speaking of which, why was the footage only playable when being played backwards? I mean, even then, how did they see the snippets of it when they were playing it forward? Oh, yeah, and did they ever explain why the goth chick was psychic? That was a thrilling backstory, wasn't it? I'm so glad they had that in the movie, that was essential to the plot!

The acting is atrocious in this film and it's clear that first-time, feature film director Joe Berlinger was out of his depth in reigning in these performers, who resort to going as over-the-top as possible with their line deliveries. The editing is also terrible, with random inserts of exposition that don't connect to anything, as well as intrusive foreshadowing that really only exists to give the film some gratuitous violence. The film is so lazy, it borrows every cliche from the horror playbook including random ghosts, jump scares, animals acting nuts, and of course, DREAM SEQUENCES! The only good that came from this film was the element of time displacement, which expands the mythology and answers some leftover questions from the first film. Apart from that, this is a complete waste of time and the only enjoyment I reaped from it was rocking out to the Marilyn Manson song that plays during the opening credits, that's as \"scary\" as the film gets.",

The film is edited to shit (so many cuts to the present and the past), the characters are unlikable, and the whole thing is confusing. There are some genuinely interesting ideas here (One example: If a group believes in a fictional thing hard enough, can that fictional thing be brought to life?), and the mystery at the heart of the film is actually an intriguing one. Unfortunately, the film throws all the puzzle pieces in a jumbled heap on the table and tells you to get to it. Figuring out what's really going on is just about impossible. It's clear that the group is suffering from severe hallucinations (sometimes even shared hallucinations), and that one or more may be possessed by The Blair Witch at different times. I suppose the simple answer is that the group is slowly being driven mad by The Blair Witch (which begs the question: Was The Blair Witch real all along,  did the group inadvertently bring her to life by believing in her, or have they been driven mad by their obsession over the Blair Witch?). Either way, the film leaves you with many, many questions and tons of almost answers (and the film is assembled in such a way that finding the truth is a herculean task). Hopefully one day we'll get a directors cut, but as it stands now Book of Shadows is interesting, frustrating, and maddening. On the plus side, I actually kind of dug the score and I liked the setting of the warehouse.",

The film is titled \"Book of Shadows,\" and yet there is no mention of any book of shadows at all. The filmmakers behind this one seem to think that cramming strange imagery at random counts as suspense and scares, but fail to realize that it's actually just utter nonsense. There's nothing wrong with ambiguity, but when all of the posed questions go unanswered, it's not ambiguity: it's nonsensicality. There's no scares, no thrills, no suspense: like its predecessor, it's a paranoia driven story, but unlike that film, the paranoia isn't effective. The Blair Witch Project works because it's grounded in reality. There's a reason so many people believed it was real footage and not just a movie: everything in the film was plausible. Here, the constant visions of random events posing as \"horror\" are just absurd, and not at all frightening. A pathetic excuse for a horror movie, and a horrible follow-up to a fantastic horror film.",

            "content": "Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 (Joe Berlinger, 2000)\n\nSo I finally got around to watching the almost universally-reviled Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, which as I write this has a 3.9 rating on IMDB and has a 13% critical rating at Rotten Tomatoes that (spoiler alert!) is scarier than anything in the movie. But, you know, I figured \"Joe Berlinger directed this movie. He's half of the team that directed Brother's Keeper and the Paradise Lost documentaries. How bad can it really be?\" By the time I was done watching it, I discovered I had been asking myself the wrong question. Instead, I was then asking myself, \"how does a director with such a proven track record (as well as the aforementioned, Berlinger had also directed at least one episode of Homicide: Life on the Street, one of the best shows ever on television) make a movie this awful?\n\nPlot: Jeffrey Patterson (Burn Notice's Jeffrey Donovan), a resident of Burkittsville, MD (the scene of the original Blair Witch Project), decides in the wake of the film's publicity to start a tourism service. A group of college students and a husband-and-wife professional ghost-hunter team take the maiden voyage, which finds itself in not-so-friendly competition with another guy who had the same idea, and is also on his maiden voyage. The first night, the crew camp out-but when they wake up the next morning after a night of drunken and drug-fueled revelry, they find that they weren't the only ones who blacked out-their everpresent video cameras have lost five hours of time. And during that five hours, the other crew of ghost hunters were brutally murdered. With Jeffrey and his charges the prime suspects, they retreat to the well-guarded house of Rustin Parr, supposedly the first victim of the Blair Witch's possession (and in whose basement the first film's unforgettable final scene takes place), and start dissecting the videotape they do have to try and figure out what happened that night.\n\nWhat makes it even more confusing is that, unlike the first film (let's face it, Joshua Leonard was the only person to come out of that movie with a career), Book of Shadows has a ridiculous cast. Stephen Turner (Seducing Charlie Barker). Erica Leerhsen (Mozart and the Whale). Kim Director (Inside Man). Tristine Skyler (Cadillac Man). Lanny Flaherty (Signs). The list goes on. Ironically, this may point to one of the potholes the movie hit-whereas Myrick and S\u00e1nchez specifically sought out inexperienced/first-time actors, the casting team for this movie went for already-established actors, which hamstrings the whole \"we have no idea who these people are\" gig. It's obvious Berlinger and co. still wanted to play on it, however, since they used the same tactic of having the actors use things close to their real names. It seems a little thing, but it shows that somewhere during the development process, a lack of thoughtfulness about the movie's direction crept in. And the finished product shows you just how dangerous that sort of thing can be. Barely coherent, unsure whether it wants to be a horror film or a mundane murder mystery, with odd moments that look as if they were shot by rank amateurs (that stand out far more in a film as otherwise well-shot as this one); it's presented nicely, but little else. *",

Seeing it now, I agree it's not very good, but it's not very pornographic. I tried to understand the point of the movie, I am not sure if \"the witch\" fucked with the tapes or if what we saw was what the characters thought was happening. I also would like to know what happened to make them like that, I kept expecting to find out they had been drugged, which would be why they couldn't remember, but no none of that. What was the evil thing they brought back? To me it wasn't very clear as to what I should be taking away with me from seeing this movie.

It's already dumber than it sounds. Back then when I first used to do reviews online, I would give a specific rating for a specific reason. Here I am going to the same. Out of 10, this movie gets a 2 for two. One of the reasons were that even though both movies had annoying characters, at least in this film, I get to see one of the girls' boobs. The second reason is this wimp who squeals the lines \"I swear to Christ\" in a police station which I still make fun of to this day and those are the only two reasons what I liked about this movie but that doesn't make this movie good.

Ditching the documentary-style for a traditionally shot film, 'Shadows' is a terribly conceived idea from start to finish, and is only made to be clumsier than one would think thanks to an F-list cast, amateur cinematographic work and a nonsensical plot. The film is so bad that it's laughable at parts, and it does not once give the audience a chance to be scared. It's the opposite of scary. Considering how bad this is, it's a wonder that the studio gave this a green light. Although they are two completely different franchises, the differences in quality between 'Shadows' and 'Paranormal Activity 2' are miles apart, with the latter being an example of how to prolong the life of a successful horror series.

            "content": "Bad writing. Bad acting. Pointless movie. Reasonably decent ending, that is extremely flawed. Blair Witch Project was a scary, creepy movie. This is an empty shallow movie... which isn't scary. It doesn't even give any creeps or crawls. It just 'is'. This movie was hyped up upon so much, and then it seems to have been completely forgotten- I can see why. The only way that movie is related to the first is due to the fact that they set it a year after the release of the first Blair Witch Project. Apart from that, this movie isn't filmed in the same style, there isn't really much connection. If it were a good movie then it would've been good as then it would've still been an original movie, and avoided being a rehash. But this film just failed across the board, and was timed so badly, but also had so many talking scenes about the mystery, but it was poorly written and acted, so it was just bad. \n\nThis film has so many flaws to it, that you just start wondering why you haven't stopped watching it in the first place, as there are things that no-one would do. If you have a miscarriage, the first thing you do is definitely not go on a horror tour. Is it? There are other flaws that will be big spoilers so I won't give it away, but these are so blatantly obvious that I couldn't let it go. The characters are so thick in this movie that you don't feel any sympathy but just find them annoying, and it drove me crazy on some of the things they will do, ad it will annoy you too, because it is so stupidly ridiculous. You could argue that if they weren't stupid then this movie wouldn't work, well it doesn't work anyway, as this movie didn't need to be made in this way. It could have worked, but it just felt unnecessary, and like I was watching a straight-to-DVD movie instead of something that had a lot of money put into it, especially compared to the last one. The first movie's budget was $60,000, while this one had \u00c2\u00a315 million.\n\nThe performances in this movie are pretty atrocious, with some scenes where one person is possessed, and she just walks around the bed really quickly whilst reciting something like she was from a primary school. Everything was so over the top, that it just didn't work, and also they tried to add humor to this movie, and it just wasn't funny, and it also didn't seem genuine which was a big problem because these movies are made to seem genuine. It never felt like I was really watching a Blair Witch movie.\n\nThe way the movie worked wasn't the worst thing, as the way it was filmed was quite clever in the way they made it seem like a documentary, but then I found myself distancing from the characters, as it just didn't feel as real as it would've done, had it been in the 'found-footage' genre. The movie was just messy, with no clear story line or plot, and the structure was all over the place, leaving some stories open, and then just closing them without much explanation.\n\nAnother problem I had was that this movie just wasn't scary in the slightest. It had some of the mot lazy attempts at scares I have seen in a long time, as the scares would be things fading in and out, or it would be flashes of something going 'boo', and that would be it. And it happened only a few times, I would probably call this a bad fantasy or thriller than a horror, because it isn't really a horror that much. Also, some of the editing in the movie is so sketchy, as things are coming in and out of the frame, and the way it is edited, and shot, it results in things being missed and misunderstood. When the end neared, I missed a few major plot points, as it just wasn't portrayed in an effective enough way.\n\nThis is no Blair Witch, it has a decent ending, but has many flaws to the ending. But by the point of the ending, you don't even care, as the movie has been pretty dull and boring for the most part, as it is just people aimlessly walking around for an hour and a half. There is no fun to be had here. No scares to be had here. But there is poorly written dialogue... all the time. Fun! Fun! Fun!",

This will go down in history as one of the worst sequels ever, a follow-up that no one asked for and only exists to cash in on the wildly successful original. But while that remains one of the most original and scariest horror films of all time, this is conventional in every way. \r\n\r\nThere's great evidence of tampering by the studio to make this more commercial, but all they've succeeded in doing is making an incoherent mess of a movie that is so bad it tarnishes the reputation of the first film. There's absolutely nothing even remotely scary about this film, as the most it can muster are a lot of shocking images that turn out to be hallucinations anyway.\r\n\r\nGone is the imagination and suggestiveness that made the original so special. Instead, it's replaced by a lot of ridiculous and unnecessary gore that doesn't even make sense within the context of the film. The sequel sets up an intriguing premise that is founded on the basis that the first movie was just that; a movie. What would happen if fans of that movie try to prove its authenticity? But that premise is forgotten about after the first twenty minutes and what follows is an excruciatingly boring and talky film with only the most threadbare connection to its predecessor. And as perhaps a sign of the studio's desperation, the title is completely meaningless. There is no \"Book of Shadows\" in \"Blair Witch 2\", as well as no scares, logic or a coherent story. This may very well be the worst film of the year.",

If it had been even a slight success, there would have been a crazy amount of additional sequels dished out. As it is, this killed the sequels and we haven't been shown any for 12 years. Thank God.\u00a0\n\nBook of Shadows took everything that was cool and terrifying about the original and threw it out the window. The first relied on its small budget as a way to scare. Instead of showing us all the details, they left it to our imagination. This one decides to show just about everything. They show us tons of blood, in a schizophrenic and hectic sort of way. We are shown hallucinations of what characters think is happening and everything seems like it is passing over everything else. It's like a 3 year old with a coloring book. Initially you can see what the picture is, but after they've scribbled on it with ten different colors in incoherent ways, all that's left is a mess.\u00a0\n\nThis takes place shortly after the hysteria of the first film. At the start we are shown clips of late night shows and critics speaking about the film. We are given a fake news broadcast that is showing us how everyone is overrunning the town of Burkittsville. Locals say it isn't true, and the sheriff tries to keep all the tourists out of the woods. One local takes it upon himself to cash in on the hysteria, creating the Blair Witch Hunt. He takes some tourists out to some spots and they party. They wake up remembering nothing. All their stuff is thrown about and they have weird marks on their flesh. They then retire to the locals house, which is a factory, in order to decode what has happened with their cameras.\n\nDon't watch it. I love the first one, but this is just a waste of time. It adds nothing to the Blair Witch story and only serves as a film Artisan thought they could make some money off of. Once again, Thank God they didn't.",
