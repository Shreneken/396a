    "summary": "Selma is a Czech immigrant, a single mother working in a factory in rural America. Her salvation is passion for music, specifically, the all-singing, all-dancing numbers found in classic Hollywood musicals. Selma harbors a sad secret: she is losing her eyesight and her son Gene stands to suffer the same fate if she can't put away enough money to secure him an operation. When a desperate neighbor falsely accuses Selma of stealing his savings, the drama of her life escalates to a tragic finale.",

It's overly pessimistic and over dramatic for the sheer purpose of poking fun at the narratives you have been accustomed to.

Audiences and critics were so taken by how distinctive and original the film is, with its deliberately rough composition and bizarre blend of sentimental melodrama and musical escapism, that they interpreted novelty alone as an indication of the film being a masterpiece. The design has originality in spades and is certainly different from just about everything that came before it, and for creativity alone it deserves some recognition. Apart from that, however, it's difficult to find many redeeming features in this film; it feels superficial and pandering, attempting to make itself seem important by contrast and not much else.\n\nIt's rare that I actively hate the experience of watching a film, but I felt nothing but loathing watching Dancer in the Dark. Every once in a while, you run into something (a work of art, a type of food, anything), and it just seems impossible to understand the love that others have for it. For me, that is just about everything by Lars von Trier, with the exception of The Kingdom. (1/5)",

Bjork is excellent as the Czech immigrant who moves to the U.S. in order to work and raise money to provide her son with surgery to cure an eye condition that will ultimately lead to blindness.  The film is unrelentingly bleak but is somehow inspirational as a mother sacrifices everything for the sake of her child.  All of von Trier's trademarks are present, including the dizzying camerawork and the disturbing subject matter.  Throw in a few nicely choreographed dance routines (yes, there's dancing aplenty) and you have a bizarre but rewarding film experience.",

I\u2019m still dumbfounded by the fact that THE LARS VON TRIER, the man behind Antichrist/Nymphomaniac/Melancholia, was able to perfectly direct the musical numbers and restrict his pretentious style. But Lars still uses the style of handheld on the cinematography for the majority of the film, and the way it shot close and shakes kinda distracts from the story. Almost all of the cast were amazing, but the actor as Selma\u2019s son gave off a wooden performance just like other kids in a Lars Von Trier film. Thank god he only gets 5 minutes of acting, and the rest of his screen-time is him singing wonderfully during a song. I should note that Bj\u00f6rk, the lead actress, actually composed all of the music in this film and I could listen the soundtrack all day. The last five minutes of the film had me full on sobbing for Selma. Not tearing, not crying, SOBBING. I was so convinced that she was a real person that I\u2019ve known for years. The only flaw I found in the writing is that there are a few moments when other characters would just state the obvious or act awkwardly for no reason. Dancer In The Dark is an amazing portrayal of how escapism can cause someone to spiral into madness yet see beauty in the madness.",

I'm sorry, but Lars von trier and Bj\u00f6rk do not know how to make an effective musical. I do believe that 6 fantasy musical numbers, bad ones, used as an escape from all the troubles Bj\u00f6rk is facing through the overly long, misguided poor excuse of a film this is is not a musical. That's a drama with some singing. Her voice sounds incredibly underdeveloped, everyone else sounds like they're singing for the first time, the cinematography is laughable and the only other movie that I can say is repetitive as this one is the room (2003). My main complaint is when you're watching a musical, you escape into a fantasy world where all conflicts are resolved at the end, or at least ends happily enough and you can't stop tapping your feet, or at the very least, the plot is compelling, the music is excellent, and if it does end tragically, they deserve it, like in Sweeney Todd. This film has none of that. This film is Bj\u00f6rk falling into worse and worse traps, while using her own bad music to escape. It's like a musical version of shawshank. Oh yeah, spoiler alert though: most musicals don't end with the protagonist getting hung. Except by that point, you're ready for the movie to be over with that you really couldn't care if she did or didn't get hung. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy",

Also, Bjork's character makes some absolute dipshit decisions toward the end and they felt almost inhuman, therefore making the ending ridiculously, overtly sad.  I did like her weird, dark, electronic music scenes which is surprising as musicals are not my forte, but they made the film interesting.",

Starting off with a lot of promise, with its raw, documentary-like feel and sensitive performance from Bj\u00f6rk, the movie quickly shows it true colours, literally and figuratively, and what follows is 2+ hours of crushing tedium, bland dialogue and maudlin monotony. It appears that it's only way to move its audience is to be as unashamedly downtrodden and bleak as possible, with no space for levity or light relief, and as a result is simply depressingly. Several parts are entirely predicated on characters being curiously incapable of providing basic explanations, and often logic and common sense are cast aside completely. I liked very few parts of it, was bored by most, and outright hated others. I will commend it on being unique however, in that I've never previously witnessed spontaneous musical numbers popping up in a film about a soft-spoken Czechoslovakian immigrant with a heredity eye condition. There's a first time for everything I guess.",

            "content": "My heart broke into three hundred different pieces while my mind was watching in awe. This is exactly how I felt after I finished Dancer in the Dark (2000).\n\nI can most definitely assure you that the twisted mind of Mr. Lars von Trier has no boundaries when it comes to cinematic genius. Written and Directed by von Trier himself, the film creates a genre of its own playing with both musical and drama along the way. I remember once reading an article somewhere on von Trier and how he expressed his desire to experiment with all the cinematic genres that ever existed... and, oh boy, he is doing it, and he is doing it in his own way. Breaking the Waves (1996) is an unconventional romance that taps on theology. Antichrist (2009) is horror manifested in psychological gore. Melancholia (2011) is a very narcissistic end-of-the-world sci-fi. Nymphomaniac (2013) is porn! There is no wonder then when he tries his hand at musicals.\n\nWhat I am getting at is that watching a von Trier film is similar to eating pickles dipped in ice cream, the only difference is that von Trier's dish actually tastes sublime. He knows how to convince you that pickles are not that salty and ice cream is not that sweet. You realize the discrepancy and the cruel irony only after you have eaten and enjoyed the meal. Proof? Try watching Dancer in The Dark a second time and compare it to any mainstream musical. What you will find is the most basic musical instruments, the dancing that does not even sync with the music, the abrupt shifts, the crude editing, the self-referential camera angles, and exaggerated sentimentality. Funny thing is that despite everything, you still enjoy the story and empathize with the characters wholeheartedly. The canny Dane not only experiments with the genre, he actually destroys it.. mocks it, and in the process, he mocks us as well.\n\nAlthough the film cannot be called a Dogme film, it certainly owes a lot of its stylistic choices to the Dogme rules, which does not strike me as a surprise since the late 1990s was high time for Dogme productions. Personally speaking, there are a lot of things I admire about Dogme films, one of them is the almost always brilliant casting. The cast of Dancer in the Dark seems to be from everywhere around the globe... Icelandic, Danish, French, American, English, German... etc. However, they fit in together harmoniously and not a single actor seems out of place. Despite the hostile tension between her and von Trier during filming, Bjork's performance turns to be a real knockout. I don't know whether she was perfect for the role or vice versa, all I can imagine is von Trier thinking of Bjork and then tailor-writing the role for her. No one, I really mean NO ONE, could have played the helpless blind Selma Jezkova as Bjork did.\n\nYou might have noticed that I did not give a synopsis of the story. With von Trier's I would rather not to. Just be prepared to watch a musical like no other.. a musical where crimes are committed, innocence is murdered and dreams are crushed.\n\nEnjoy it. Break your heart. Then laugh at yourself.",

            "content": "With Lars Von Trier as director and Catherine Deneuve as a lead, Dancer in the Dark sounded like a diverse step forward for me to be viewing.\n\nDancer in the Dark ended up being an interesting film which was worth a viewing, but it is clearly a flawed feature.\nThe story in Dancer in the Dark is not that great. Lars Von Trier attempts to disguise the thin nature of the premise with an innovative film style. While the style of everything in Dancer in the Dark is interesting, it cannot fully disguise the nature of the story. It has a lot of potential and some interesting subject matter, but it ends up reducing itself to melodramatic sentimentality and it ges in senselss directions. The style of the film actually becomes an issue here because as thefilm style is really not that normal, it makes the rest of the film feel rather artificial. The premise has a certain level of value, but it ends up being too stuck in Lars Von Trier's nihilistic indulgence to actually stand up at all. I mean, a story about a girl going blind whose life collapses around her could have been interesting, but it needed to be better thought through and executed in an alternative way. If the actual mood of the film reflected the nature of its concepts then perhaps it could have been a lot better, but since it instead went in the direction of being a rather surreal musical film, the tone of the film is just odd. I can say that Lars Von Trier deserves props for his ambition on the project, but despite its potential, Dancer in the Dark never really reaches what it sets out to and instead ends up an unbalanced project which sports a lot of style but little in the way of substance that is not just more melodramatic nihilism. The light spirit of the film does not match the harsh reality of the story, and so the experience of Dancer in the Dark ends up rather strance and even emotionally distant. \nThe visual style of Dancer in the Dark is interesting. Although I thought that at the start I might not be able to enjoy the way that it was filmed in a mockumentary film style and with a rough quality handheld camera, eventually I found that I enjoyed the style. It made the film memorable and gave it a certain sense of imagery that made things feel almost surreal, almost as if the film was giving us insight into the mind of protagonist Selma Jezkova. Everything looks rough and unbalanced, and as the protagonist's vision gradually begins to succumb to blindnesswe gain an understanding of what she is seeing. The style of Dancer in the Dark actually ends up looking pretty impressive, and the cinematography captures both the beautiful nature of the scenery from many interesting perspectives and is then edited at a good pace. As a visual experience, Dancer in the Dark is an easy film to remember because it really proves how much Lars Von Trier is against standard theatrical conventions when it comes to storytelling, and it establishes the nature of his film style, for better and for worse. More so, Dancer in the Dark shows off Lars Von Trier's eye for strong imagery and his ability to build a complex atmosphere than a front for him to reveal his abilities at crafting a decent story.\nAnd although the musical number scenes are a little odd and may even feel somewhat out of place, the film breaks into song in an interesting manner by developing at a decent pace into them before Bjork sings her heart out in the sequences. The tunese are catchy and are nice on the ears, further helping to establish the atmosphere of the film. Frankly, the style of Dancer in the Dark has its pros and it has its cons, but all in all it makes the film a rather trippy experience and therefore a memorable one. It is further enhanced by the talents of the cast.\nBjork Does an excellent job of proving how talented she is as an actress in Dancer in the Dark. While the film serves as a front for her to show off her internationally recognised singing talents, the focus of the importance is more on her acting and she manages to reveal just what kind of skill she holds when it comes to that level of entertainment value. Bjork portrays Selma Jezkova excellently with a performance so full of life that she is able to carry the screen easily by herself. She makes Selma Jezkova a compelling character and a likable one which the audience is able to find themselves caring about. Bjork projects a lot of spirit in her role and manages to show off just what good acting is truly about as well as what versatile talents she has to show off. Dancer in the Dark is a medium for many things, and one of them is the acting talents of Bjork which were good enough to score her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. While the tone of the film is troublesome, Bjork manages to make it work and entertains viewers in the process.\nCatherine Deneuve also gives a nice performance. Although she does not recieve as much screen time as I had hoped, her performance is impressive and entertaining in an innovative way and it projects a lot of spirit within her. She manages to interact with the rest of the cast very well and you could honestly not expect anything less from the Academy Award nominee. Catherine Deneuve manages to work alongside Lars Von Trier very well and he brings out one of her more noticable performances in recent years.\n\nSo Dancer in the Dark is an innovative and stylish film. The fact that it is a lot more style over substance my faze some viewers and turn them off due to the indulgent material as well as the fact that the story is a melodramatic venture which is rather ridiculous, but the visual style of the film is unforgettable due to its colourful and surreal nature as well as the skilled performances from the cast, particularly the leading performance of Bjork.",
