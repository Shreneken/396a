Personally, this is all about camerawork, always moving and no flaws, emphasised the connected tales. The frogs in the end is meh.

            "content": "'Magnolia' is perhaps the most polarising of Paul Thomas Anderson's work. A lot of people have found it thought-provoking, emotionally impacting and dazzling in many ways, while many others have found it dull, self-indulgent, bloated and overlong.\n\nThis reviewer falls into the former camp. 'Magnolia' perhaps feels indulgently overlong in places, and the final group musical number does feel contrived and out of sorts with the rest of the film. On the whole though 'Magnolia' is a dark, daring and dazzling film, and another winner in a filmography where this reviewer has yet to watch a dud.\n\nAll of Anderson's films are visually stunning, and 'Magnolia' has some of the most haunting and scintillating arresting images of any of his films, especially at the end. The long takes and tracking shots are distinctively Anderson and look wonderful, the whole film is beautifully shot, very atmospherically lit and the production design is suitably audacious. The soundtrack is rich in emotion and sticks in the head, and all the song choices are well chosen. Some found it intrusive, not to me.\n\nRegarding the script, it contains some of the most thought-provoking, layered and poignant writing of all Anderson's films. The story has a long length to work with, and doesn't disappoint with the pacing which is a mix of suitably manic and suitably languid when either extreme is needed, unpredictable, beautifully developed, hugely entertaining, dark and often very emotional scenarios and richly layered characters, remarkable for so much going on. Anderson's direction is also exemplary.\n\nAnother controversial asset of 'Magnolia' is the ending, something that many will find powerful (again fall into this camp) and others will be perplexed. Whatever extreme you find yourselves, it certainly is not an ending that one forgets easily. Anderson's mastery of direction of actors and their interactions shows through loud and clear, with the whole cast giving superb performances in one-of-a-kind roles, for some among their best.\n\nTom Cruise in particular has an absolute ball, and he is particularly well supported by a gleefully entertaining and charming John C. Reilly, a touchingly restrained William H. Macy, an as always exemplary Philip Seymour Hoffmann and a heartfelt Julianne Moore. Jason Robards and Melora Walters also do brilliantly.\n\nIn conclusion, dark, daring and dazzling. The most polarising of Anderson's films but incredibly well executed, a flawed masterpiece somewhat. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Over its multiple storylines and countless characters, the film deals with redemption, regret, the pain of loneliness, fate and coincidence, and, perhaps most importantly, the irreparable damage that parents can inflict on their children.  It is dark and it is somber but it is never anything less than riveting thanks to standout performances (possibly Tom Cruise's best), an ingeniously complex interwoven plot, and Anderson's ability to immerse the viewer in the story through clever and creative camera movement, much of the time consisting of long, uncut Steadicam shots.  This is a tremendous follow-up to Boogie Nights and cemented his place as a renowned director.",

By the end of the movie, I didn't feel like the plot connected cohesively, and when reading up about the movie, I think its a nice attempt, but ultimately it fails at what it sets out to do, which is to create this epic sort of psychological movie. It's ultimately clumsy and not executed well enough. It's also a movie you could watch more than once, and perhaps this might change my mind, but, I don't foresee me watching it again anytime soon.

Each character has to answer that question for themselves - without a an obvious answer which approach is right. The metaphysical and post modern tricks wear a little from the '90s. But mostly they work powerfully. For example, the frogs - torn from Hebrew bible's Exodus story provides a complex metaphor from the terror, confusion, and sense of redemption each character goes through.

If you enjoy a lot of actor abuse, verbal abuse (even professional child abuse) you could somehow like this movie. If you've ever wondered what a movie might be like that's written and directed by a self-confessed cocaine user, under-aged pornography addict, as well as being a, Quote; \"my favourite filmmaker copycat\" - then this could be getting close to realising your dream (perhaps this might also sadly sum up Hollywood today, as well as some audiences) \n\nHave tried to sit this through several times (only because of the cast and the hugely conflicting reviews!) but each time was left wanting to throw something at the screen or run screaming from the room. 'Over-everything' is one description that readily comes to mind but, other unprintable ones are first and foremost. Many others have neatly summed-up this tosh very well but few can ever do it the justice it deserves. Writer/director P.T. Anderson can't even write a single paragraph that's not filled with vulgar language or unnecessary four-letter words and 90% of his characters are simply not worth caring for.\n\nMaybe this could be another example of the modern Academies short-sightedness spotlighting one of the reasons why so many patrons stopped going to the movies around this time, also why many movies of this ilk don't deliver the good returns expected. If your life is so uneventful that you can throw away over three (yes 3) laborious hours of visual splendour being wasted on a theme so repugnantly ugly - then you're welcome to this excruciatingly heavy-handed overindulgence. The movie plays out like several movies in one, with none of them much good or making much sense when edited together - mild interest soon gives way to boredom. \n\nAs for the director's favourite singer being played endlessly in the background, this just becomes another annoyance. When a moviemaker publicly makes a statement like: \"I'll make pretty good movies the rest of my life but I guess Magnolia is, for better or worse, the best movie I'll ever make\". Then please let me say: Stay out of our lives P.T. Anderson - way out.  But of course, those either on the payroll or who consider themselves as knowing better than most will disagree.",

            "content": "Paul Thomas Anderson's \"Magnolia\" is an ambitious, multi-layered and spellbinding masterpiece that sheds light on the scars left behind by child abuse. With his third feature, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson crafted a mesmerizing mosaic about nine individuals whose lives are interconnected by fate, coincidence and chance. Using captivating cinematography, Anderson draws viewers into the world of neglected children that refuse to forgive their dying parents. From intimate close-ups to tense tracking shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's distinct setting. Anderson's screenplay is also spectacular, and expertly uses non-linear storytelling to keep viewers engaged in the lives of nine interconnected individuals. It is hard to not admire the astonishing performances from the cast. Tom Cruise delivers one of the best performances of his career as a charismatic sex guru with a traumatic past. It's a tricky role that requires the actor to toe a fine line between being sympathetic and despicable, but he pulls it off effortlessly. Julianne Moore is equally excellent in the role of a tormented woman in the midst of a devastating divorce. Finally, Philip Seymour Hoffman brings humanity to the role of a compassionate nurse that cares for a dying Cancer patient. Although \"Magnolia\" is undeniably unforgettable, ultimately it is not a film that is meant for everyone. It tackles controversial topics such as child abuse, drug addiction and trauma that will likely upset some viewers. Nevertheless, fans of Paul Thomas Anderson will definitely enjoy \"Magnolia\" and so will movie-goers seeking thought-provoking entertainment. At a time when child abuse is rarely depicted in films, it remains a stirring reminder of the power of Cinema as a healing art-form.",

Anderson's ambitious vision intertwines the story lines of twelve disparate characters whose shuddering lives find redemption in miraculous ways. Mostly it's an expose of the broken American family and the damaged husks it renders the innocents. Yet, beneath its black layers of anger and guilt, \"Magnolia\" is a marvel of hope. The outstanding cast features some of our most fearless stars -- Julianne Moore, Jason Robards, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy and a host of excellent unknowns. Most surprising, at the center of all this, Tom Cruise bowls you over with the performance of a lifetime, writhing in pain like the exposed nerve of a rotten tooth. \"Magnolia\" goes above and beyond conventional narrative, ingeniously integrating, to astonishing effect, genre elements of fantasy, documentary and even musical theater.

            "content": "Paul Thomas Anderson is a very good film director and he manages to produce a film that is gripping for just over three hours despite some significant missteps in terms of the direction the story takes. Where I tend to take against him is when modern film buffs call him a modern day Stanley Kubrick which irks me as he hasn't created anything as innovative as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) but this is my favorite of his films. I don't think it is a masterpiece, it does have it's flaws, but it does contain flashes of brilliance and I would prefer to watch something that has aims as high as this film does than a film that doesn't even try.\n\nSeveral lives intersect over the course of a few days in Los Angeles, California. Motivational speaker Frank Mackey, Tom Cruise, who instructs men on how to \u2018tame' women, is forced to come to terms with his childhood trauma when he is contacted by Phil Parma, Philip Seymour Hoffman, the nurse of his dying father Earl Partridge, Jason Robards. Partridge abandoned Mackey and his mother as a child leaving him to take care of her as she died of cancer. In modern times his trophy wife Linda, Julianne Moore, regrets her decision to cheat on her husband and slowly has a mental breakdown. Television host, Jimmy Gator, Philip Baker Hall, cheats on his wife and may have molested his daughter Claudia, Melora Walters. On the show he hosts prodigal child Stanley Spector, Jeremy Blackman, is used by his father in order to win money and he is humiliated when he pees himself during the taping of the show and refuses to answer questions. Claudia begins a relationship with incompetent police officer Jim Kurring, John C. Relly, while a former contestant on Gator's show, Donnie Smith, William H. Macy, plots to rob his former employers after being rejected by the man he has long held feelings for.\n\nThe film swings for the fences in it's attempt to show the influence that damaging father figures can have on their children and how the guilt over this can ravage the fathers. This point is illustrated best in a long monologue that Robards delivers in which she covers his relationship with his first wife, Lily, and his guilt over having cheated on her and finally having left her. Robards is able to convey so much emotion in this brief amount of time as we feel the tenderness in his voice when he describes first seeing the woman he loves and the horror when he admits to his infidelity and even worse his lies. There was beauty in the monologue as while it ends in tragedy we realize that this man who had been presented as a monster did feel some regret over his actions and did realize that what he had was special. His acknowledgement that saying no regrets is wrong in particular spoke to me as everybody has regrets and while his should be larger than most it is important that he should be able to express this regret.\n\nThe performances are fantastic as you would expect from a cast this talented and varied but they each play roles we are not accustomed to seeing them in. Moore convincingly plays a woman slowly falling to pieces as she is touchy, self righteous and painfully self conscious with every move. She appears elegant and put together but she is even more troubled than the characters we would go on to see her play in Far from Heaven (2002) and What Maisie Knew (2012). Cruise brings the manic intensity he uses to such great effect in Rain Man (1988) and The Firm (1993) but there is a vulnerability in him that has never been there before and when his deceptions are revealed there is a pain on his face that is shocking. We believe him as the confident performer even as he stands in front of a poster that reads, \"No pussy has nine lives\" while also being able to reconcile this version of him with the man who sits crying next to his dying father. \n\nThe film lost me at several moments however as the interconnectedness goes too far when all of the main characters sing Aimee Mann's \"Wise Up\" all at once and of course when the frogs fall from the sky and the painting in Claudia's living room reads \"But it happened.\" Had he dropped these unnecessary conceits the film would have been all the better for it and I would not have been so aware of the mental steps that you are required to take in order to follow this film.",

The negatives: the run time is overly long, the focus is incredibly incoherent, and there is no real connection to everyone involved outside of emotion. I still suggest you should see it, but you probably won't re-watch it.",

I wish it were shorter and more fast paced, but alas Anderson fails to cut down his films to a more manageable size. However, I thoroughly enjoyed Magnolia. Its unique shots, story twists, and excellent writing keep it in check.\n\nBeautiful music and heartfelt writing collide as the intertwined lives of these various figures in society mesh for the most original film I have seen in a long time. There is no other film quite like Magnolia. It is like the intense crescendo of harrowing events like Requiem for a Dream with the scattered perspective narrative of Pulp Fiction. It even has moments of the surreal comedy like the Coen Brothers' The Big Lebowski or Fargo.\n\nNotably, Magnolia features incredibly moving acting. Tom Cruise gives one of his most versatile and enjoyable performances, while John C. Reilly delivers his most touching dramatic role ever. Philip Seymour Hoffman is also so empathetic and kind. You feel his acting in your soul. William H. Macy is wonderful. Julieanne Moore continues her endless string of brilliant dramatic roles. Magnolia is perfectly cast.\n\nMagnolia may be odd, but its originality and creativity know no bounds. Check it out if you can handle delicate subject matter. The drama is worth watching.",

It is, perhaps, precisely because of this unfamiliarity of character assignment that I was able to so thoroughly lose myself in the unraveling sequence of events without constantly having those quick magic-dispelling reality checks where all I can do is rate a performer's ability to play a particular character instead of being able to forget that the actor is in fact anyone other than the current role in which they have been cast.  \n\nI could spend inordinate amounts of additional time expounding on the further accomplishments of this movie, but can presumably make due with simply doing my best to honor the heart of this work by once again assuring potential watchers that this is a masterwork of modern cinema and a powerful & beautiful celluloid dissection of questionable circumstance, overt acknowlegment, personal responsibility, hidden motivation, inner growth, and the promise & hope of eventual healing. \n\nI cannot speak highly enough of this movie and encourage all who have even remotely considered taking in this film to do themselves the immense favor of finally doing so.\n\nI cannot see how you would possibly be disappointed once having done so.",

They even set up, in the opening narration, the promise of a truly special conclusion. I was on board, fully invested, and ready to be wowed. That\u0092s about when Paul Thomas Anderson decided to become an artiste. He actively plays against expectations, flying in the face of what a normal audience would want, and gives pointless insanity. I\u0092m sure some people who love symbolism, metaphor, and ambiguous artistic expression will have a totally different view on this (and the high critic scores show that.) However for a dumb-dumb like me it takes what I was enjoying as an engaging realistic drama, and throws it into surreal land. The tone and style swing is so dramatic that I needed a neck brace to avoid whiplash. There are a few other choices made by Anderson that annoyed me, like some dialogue that was too quiet and music playing loudly over that dialogue, but those are minor quibbles. My review is a tale of two movies, the one I was enjoying, and the one it turned into. It\u0092s hard to know how to rate something like this because it was great until it became bonkers.",

And all of the performances were top notch. I find with most PT Anderson movies I end up mostly watching for the portrayal of the main character. Not to say I don't like the stories in them, I've just really enjoyed the characters a lot (especially Barry, in Punch-Drunk Love). They're always mesmerizing. But since there were so many main characters here, I was watching for all of them, as well as the story, and I just watched even more attentively when my favorite characters were on screen. Magnolia is a movie with a premise that I think only PT Anderson is capable of perfecting. It seems to be polarizing for new fans of the director, but at the same time I think it's his best work.",

All that being said this film is not for everyone. Coming in at a running time of over 3 hours and the many complex characters who's different stories intersect in the most creative way, could turn off those who want to just watch mindless entertainment and not really have to get a message or take something from the experience. But if you are a film buff or just want to see excellent performances with a mind blowing premise this is a must see. I also read that Anderson came up with this movie around the songs on the equally impressive Aimee Mann. Her songs are all throughout the film and if I'm not mistaken the songs came before the film - the film was inspired by the songs used in the movie. This is my personal favorite film of all time and each time I see it I get something more out of it. So do yourself a favor and give it a try.

Some decks are reshuffled and given another chance to play it right; some are wiped away, while some remain the same.  However, the movie is ultimately optimistic in the power of human love and forgiveness in making life meaningful and endurable.  The divine power in this film is not the cuddling micro-manager of sweetness, but a stern, inscrutable force giving human the full lot of freewill, redeemed only the the potentiality of love and forgiveness.  It is up to us to make heaven or hell in our own lives; we don't need hereafter to know where we live in the Dantesque Comedy here on earth.  The Freewill reigned supreme in those cruel old men who inflicted so much damage to their children.  That is true Freewill, unadulterated by wishful-thinkings. That is the darkness of human souls.  The next generation may continue, given the inheritance of their anger and pain, to inflict new pain upon their own children. Cruise's character is the manifestation of burying deep suffering through inflicting suffering.  However is also reign supreme in the act of love and compassion of hospice nurse, the policeman, and the trophy wife played by Moore.",

            "content": "Magnolia is a film that will explicitly transcend the typical plot of a movie-for better or for worse. Following a cast of characters for a single day in Los Angeles, their lives intersect and crash into each other. As pressures of the day cause them to irrevocably change their lives, they all must face the consequences down the road and meet their new realities. While no singular conflict exists, there are numerous parallels between the stories that unfold onscreen, among which, most notably, is a broken parent-child relationship: Tom Cruise plays a misogynistic strong man who gives testosterone filled speeches for men on how to seduce women, and it all becomes too clear his actions stem from the absence of his now dying father (Jason Robards). That father has a all-too-helpful nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a now regretful trophy wife (Juliane Moore). On a seemingly unrelated story, John C. Reiley is a by-the-rules, bumbling cop who falls for Claudia (Melora Walters), who has her own drug and attachment issues from a less than perfect father (Philip Baker Hall). That father hosts a game show with children whose current star (Jerry Blackman) is facing abuse by his own father. Meanwhile, a past child star (William H. Macy) now has financial issues from his parents squandering his winnings and must face his own emotional troubles. \n\tIn what plays like a sophisticated Lifetime drama, these characters come to face their pasts and hope for a brighter future. However, with a confusing yet no less inspired ending, director Paul Thomas Anderson leaves the film as a question as to what is truly possible in connections and in relationships. Throughout the film, there are anecdotes about incredible coincidences and discussions about the fundamentals of movie plotpoints. Anderson leaves us wondering whether these resolved endings are truly possible in life. While it could be seen as a commentary on the ridiculousness of how some movies end, I have no doubt it is an inspiring message that allows people to try to achieve those happy endings that sometimes seemed to be trapped in the films we love to watch.\n\tMagnolia is a very competent film: using songs by Aimee Mann, the film never falters from the bittersweet tone that encompasses life. Anderson utilizes the camera to never leave a dull moment, but by far, these actors' performances stand out above all. In what can only be described as Williams-esque, each actor gives a fully flushed out emotional journey that leaves not one person questioning the authenticity of each particular feeling. Tom Cruise particularly stands out, with a complexity and development that could surmount to the best of his career. All in all, Magnolia can hold its own. Although dragging its feet at times with filler, the entire experience is an enjoyable one; it's a film that will keep the characters in your heart, and its blatant, but no less timeless lessons in your life.",

An ensemble cast, each playing intricate characters whose lives we will catch a good glimpse of and all the while we'll know that everything is going to come together in some way and we're gong to leave feeling completely satisfied. To some extent, that is exactly what happens, but it also isn't.\n\nSound complicated? Well, that's because it is. Magnolia is brimming with ideas and it's blatantly obvious that Paul Thomas Anderson had a blast when putting this one together. There are so many characters, none of whom are short-changed in this three hour film and so many different emotional colours are touched upon throughout the piece. \n\nIt's never even slightly dull or boring though and it goes from dramatic to comedic with such ease and Grace that you begin to understand why the likes of Hoffman, Moore, Cruise, and Macy would all be willing to take part in this film without any of them ever being the star. \n\nThere is no one story here, instead there's like seven or something- I don't even remember, but I loved them all and I believed them all and I didn't really care that, as the film went on, it looked less and less likely that I was every gong to feel truly fulfilled when all was said and done. By the half-way point, I saw no real way for the characters involved to come together and it was fine with that. I still wanted it though, I really did. \n\nThen it happened. This... thing, just kind of happened and, as critic Joe Siegel noted (very disparagingly, I might add):\n\n\"(it) had nothing to do with anything that we've seen before that I couldn't watch. I literally could not watch it\".\n\nI, on the other hand, could not stop watching it. This 'moment' will ever hit you as the great success or the great failure in this film and I'll let you watch it for yourself and decide. However, for me, it was clearly a success and it remains one of my favourite moments in film history. As Ebert put it:\n\n\"what it transforms at the end is our expectation that every movie has to be dead in the water and be predictable, be formulaic and in the way we expect it to. This movie is alive and free to surprise us\". \n\nThis is a pretty melodramatic work and it heavily features the music of Aimee Mann, going as far as to have characters in the film both quote her work and, at one, point even actually sing it. To some people, this will probably be a bit much but, hey, I really like Aimee Mann and I think the songs are great so I liked it. \n\nYou might think that this film is a disaster but I think that you should watch it anyway. Why? Well, instead, you might end up thinking that it's kind of a masterpiece. Isn't individual interpretation great?",

            "content": "Magnolia a movie produced, written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson\nMagnolia ties together multiple narrative stories in this 3-hour production. Theme in the movie is seen as parental neglect and abuse. A good aspect of the film is the editing and the shots taken. It creates a good flow of the movie and the consistency of how fast the movie went. The Overall performance was good I find, however, the some scenes were random and maybe irrelevant which did slow down the film and affect my experience toward it. The acting was amazing and would say that Tom Cruise was the MVP both his acting and the character he played were both amazing in the film. Then we see the cop, John C. Reily, who played a good cop performance. Now the two weakest characters I found were Macy's and Moore. Macy's character, the whiz kid Donnie Smith, didn't impact as much. His scenes and his character were random all through the movie. Although he fits the theme of the movie as we see his back story explained. William H. Macy although a good actor his performance as this character didn't draw much attention and I find didn't seem all that relevant in the movie. Moore's character was a lot of the time mad and flipping people off and being all crazy though out the film. Maybe without her in the film, the film would've been tighter and maybe would've been a better overall performance. John C Reily's voice over in the film, I find, to be the second best part of the movie. Although he comes off as pretentious and religious, Paul Thomas Anderson, uses his monologue to create a feeling like we were actually his partner in crime is the film. The near ending of the film, the other whiz kid, Stanley and his interaction with his father was really weak. We see at the end of the film many resolutions found in each of the individual characters problems. His interaction mixed in it was flat and could've been a more powerful and meaningful dialogue between the two. The best performance, of course, in the film was Tom Cruise and his character. His monologue and scenes all taking in one shot was near impossible not to get drawn in and really intrigued with this character. Overall I rate this film 4/5 and would watch again.",

            "content": "Whereas Robert Altman liked to root his massive ensemble films in dirt-on-the-ground reality and an all too savage brand of irony, Paul Thomas Anderson, his late-'90s disciple, favors a more slow-burning, cunning method that involves a front of black comedy that slowly reveals itself to be consuming melodrama in a fashion only comparable to the opening of a Russian doll.  His breakthrough, \"Boogie Nights\", introduced itself as a porn industry satire, but, unexpectedly, decided to rip its mask off during its second act to confess a true identity of tragedy.  \"Magnolia\", his third feature, greets us with a playful documentary about the nature of coincidence only to suddenly submerge us in a labyrinth of dying tycoons, charming misogynists, boorish housewives, bumbling cops, sensitive nurses, and repressed child celebrities, all set to the tune of Aimee Mann and eccentric weather patterns.\n\tTo compare it to \"Short Cuts\" or \"Nashville\" would be a mistake only because \"Magnolia\" doesn't share the same spirit - similar are their massive ensembles, the way they pull you into the jagged lives of jagged people and never allows your interest to cease.  But where \"Short Cuts\" and \"Nashville\" dared to see the humor in everyday hardships, \"Magnolia\" is a deluge of emotional catharsis kept bottled for decades prior to its events and left to explode for the viewer to ingest.  Its humorous flavors are left out only for the darkest of people to snicker at - even the comedy reeks of contrition.  The aforementioned documentary gives us an understanding that the film's characters are all ingeniously connected, whether they share a mutual friend or just happen to unknowingly pass the other by on the street; but where the documentary is whimsical, \"Magnolia\" goes deeper.  It's a daisy chain of various shades of melancholy.\n\tCovering a 24-hour period in Los Angeles, \"Magnolia\" depicts the final few hours of former TV giant Earl Partridge's (Jason Robards) life - dying of cancer and confined to his bed, he confesses to his nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman) that his biggest regret still haunts him.  As a young man, he left his sick wife in the care of his teenaged son, while he, without a care in the world, continued on a path of womanizing as the life he left behind suffered immensely.  His son, Frank (Tom Cruise), has grown into a misogynist who promotes \"Seduce and Destroy\", a step-by-step guide for the sadistic lonely heart who wishes to have a one night fling with a looker and dump her the next day.\n\tA similarly doomed television great, Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall), is facing his last days as a game show host, not quite taking his final breaths but close to completely collapsing in the headlights of the irrepressible media.  The world sees him as a faraway father figure, but his personal life suggests anything but.  His estranged daughter, Claudia (Melora Walters), has spiraled into a cataclysm of cocaine addiction.  His wife (Melinda Dillon), completely oblivious, doesn't realize that her husband has been unfaithful throughout their marriage.\n\tOn coinciding paths of destruction are Earl's wife (Julianne Moore), who married him for the money but is beginning to realize that she actually loves the man and is hopelessly depressed by his illness, Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), a past-dwelling child prodigy/game show champion who believes he will win the love of a metalmouthed bartender if he gets braces too, and Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman), a kid in the same shoes as the young Donnie who wants to be viewed as a person rather than a weirdo moppet with a lot of facts brimming in his young head.  \n\tIn \"Magnolia\", Anderson's takes risk after risk after risk, whether his uninhibitedness is represented by scenes like the one where the leading characters all simultaneously sing to Aimee Mann staple \"Wise Up\" or the finale that sees frogs (yes, frogs) rain from the sky like an all too literal alternative to the metaphorical torrent of cats and dogs.  But \"Magnolia\" is more than just risk-taking; it's audacious filmmaking that pays in its every step.  It, at three-hours, surprisingly doesn't require a great deal of patience.  It's magnetic from start to finish - these characters, so fucked up and in such need of an escape from this hell called life, are impossible not to become obsessed with.\n\tTake Linda Patridge (Moore), who was fine being a trophy wife for a while, who was fine sneaking around while pretending to love her husband, and who was fine marrying an old rich guy for the sake of comfort.  But her past mistakes haunt her more than ever as she begins to understand that her materialism, at one point, paused in favor of realness.  She can only express herself in vulgarities, spitting out a hard-edged \"fuck\" between every word; in one scene, she has a meltdown in front of a pharmacist simply because he asks her why she's purchasing so much medication.      \n\tOr take Frank Mackey, who was abandoned by his father as a child yet takes out all his anger on women, the very same gender that stuck by him during his developing years.  He's been so harshly shaped by his hate that he can hardly understand just what a monster he's become - he's only concerned with making himself \"happy,\" hardly affected when he crushes the emotions of a different soul.  In the break between one of his \"Seduce and Destroy\" seminars, he is interviewed by a television reporter (April Grace) who asks him of his past, wondering aloud if his mother is supportive of his reprehensible lifestyle.  He laughs, acting as though his mother never stopped supporting him, getting serious when he sighs that his father passed on years ago.  But the reality is, in fact, the opposite.  When the reporter confronts his dishonesty - she did her research and discovered the connection between Frank and his famous father - he sits in angry silence, refusing to answer any further questions.  He is so numbed by the events that made him the man he is today that a suggestion of those dark times leaves him completely defenseless.  He is, once again, put into the shoes of a helpless child at the mercy of a careless father.  After he is contacted by Earl's nurse, he hesitantly agrees to go visit the man just so he can tell him how much he hates his guts before he takes his final breath.\n\tWhile the most fascinating characters in \"Magnolia\" are the ones at the biggest crossroads in their lives, the most touching are Officer Jim (John C. Reilly) and Donnie Smith, both of whom have plenty of love to give but feel hopeless at every turn.  Jim knows that he's the least talented policeman in Los Angeles, and, despite his good nature, is haunted by it.  Donnie knows that he's a has-been more likely a never-was, but he clings to his long ago fame because it's all he has left in his awful life - when he falls in love with the idea of the muscular bartender of his favorite tavern, his braces idea is pathetic but understandable.  He wants to fight for something he believes in, to start a new chapter in his life even if starting that new chapter is closer to impossible than plausible.  Their lives are transformed when Jim meets Claudia for the first time - her apartment's cranked music and unpredictable behavior leads to a disturbance call - and when Donnie attempts to rob his work safe and realizes that it's perfectly acceptable to look at life from a new perspective without the love angle.  Jim sees potential in Claudia's damaged frame, not willing to let her scarred interior/drug-addicted exterior get the best of her; Donnie sees potential in living for the future instead of the past.\n\tMost significantly, \"Magnolia\" isn't just a film about circumstance, about coincidence - it's also about the meaning of life, about what it takes to recover from personal turmoil, what it takes to find a reason to live in a lost world.  Only 28 during production, Anderson displays a talent far more perceptive than the majority of his peers.  He takes the good and the bad, throws them at a wall, and studies their behavior with a conviction rarely held.  He insists on revealing monologues, insistent music, and low-key eccentricity.  And for all its imperfections,  \"Magnolia\" is one of the greatest films of the 1990s.",

Magnolia's pacing on it's first half is the best thing about it where the director efficiently uses his ensemble cast and cuts out from individual stories at pivotal points to create a much needed hype. However, on it's second half, Anderson gives more time to individual characters and does not use the fast cuts which hackened the pace a lot. Despite of all these, the cast still provided marvelous performances throughout the end, most remarkable of them being Tom Cruise. Much like in his film Boogie Nights, the director fails to find ample screen time for Philip Seymour Hoffman, especially in the second half.",

            "content": "Appalling piece of utterly plagiarised nonsense, bombastic, stuffy, ridiculous, overbearing, overwrought and mind numbingly to absurd to exist even as an overextended dark comedy, never mind a serious drama. Wretched director Paul Thomas Anderson-who the hell said he deserved a career, takes what he hopes was a generally true bunch of anecdotes and then throws every embarrassment at the screen he can for dramatic licence. He clearly wants so badly to be the next Robert Altman, with 'Short Cuts' his clearly stolen vehicle of choice, in everything from the three hour running time (only with 'Magnolia' it feels like 300 years), the same number of intersecting characters in a big cast (though lacking the star power of the 1993 ensemble) to even pinching an actress from that film (Julieanne Moore) since by 1999 she'd become a name to reckon with.\n\nWe're expected to believe that everybody in this pompous, blundering epic of noisy absurdity is supposedly interconnected to and through each other during one night in the San Fernando Valley through their random events of yelling, incest, hiding drugs, dropping guns, killing each other, trying not to kill each other, being related to each other, not being related to each other and so on, but out of every actor in this high brow junk, only Julieanne Moore, in a ridiculous role comes close to making us care about her. Of all the others, respected actors John C.Reilly as a stupid cop, and William H Macy as an idiot who wants dental work he doesn't need come across lousily lame, Phil Seymour Hoffman has even less to do than in 'Happiness', and every other actor, from the peeing kid on a gameshow to the apparently raped by her father Melora Waters, you just want to kill. To make all this even worse, no one ever even talks to each other in a film where the so-called dialogue IS SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF EVERYBODY'S WAILING, HOLLERING, YELLING LUNGS in the hope it comes off strong and weighty, when it's just as false and off-putting as everything else about this sorry, soggy, extremely awful excuse for an outrageously respected piece of tosh. Ripping of the title from 'Steel Magnolias', the familial incest of 'A Thousand Acres'-including the father from that film, with other films like 'Trees Lounge', 'Playing By Heart' and 'It's The Rage', among others, showing up in some form or another, the only audacious thing about the whole enterprise is how (a) Anderson got away with it and (b) critics and viewers LET him get away with it.\n\nNever real, always stupid, and with a vile as usual Tom ooze Cruise laughingly cast (no change there then) as a sex guru of all things (I think his many ex wives may chortle over that irony) intoning to the camera how to \"tame the clit\" just makes you want to sink into your chair and die. Oh and I so didn't know he was going to be Julieanne's stepson. 'Playing By Heart' much, not least with the same actress-April Grace-interviewing him like she did with Dennis Quaid's character in that far better film. As is everything else it rips off.\n\nAnd the end! Oh my God, when it finally comes, what do we get? A plague of frogs! One even triggers the trigger of a gun for someone? The audience perhaps, about to shoot themselves over this hell. Still, it only sets the seal on a horrible experience beyond belief. Frogs?! Like there's even that many left. Still, why not? In between the five million other ridiculous things happening throughout, it kind of doesn't even stand out. Though Anderson's lousy style does. With nothing of Robert Altman's light touch, intersecting coincidences over several days during real character interaction, or the ability to weave issues in and out of a film's running time without making them a mountain to cross every minute, Thomas Anderson hasn't a hope when it comes to emulating the great and he should stop now if only. It also helps when people talk naturally in a film, as opposed to SHOUTING NOTHING IMPORTANT AT EACH OTHER IN BURSTS OF HYSTERICAL WHINES CALLING FOR MORE REPETITION OF SWEAR WORDS THEN ACTUAL WORDAGE. And I'm guessing the frogs stood in for Mr Altman's very natural earthquake as the 'Short Cuts' final, as it weaved everyone's story together for the final. I'm guessing Anderson knew he couldn't be that blatant-after all, I never said he stole all the film, just around 90% with the other 10% coming from the other films mentioned.",

Cruise nailed the scene with him, and PSH was great, but unsure as a whole. The sequence of everyone singing was great, I like that risk. The raining frogs was also a great sequence obviously, a fantastic way to reach a dramatic peak. As an unexplained events, coincidence type of film, I almost wish more of that strangeness played into it. It sort of felt like a beautiful mess to me, which in many ways was the point. I think when PTA says this is his greatest movie, it might be because this was his take on universal humanity. Filmmakers only get one chance at films like this, usually. It's his epic, it's his painting of life. Everything else he has done touches on universal themes and experiences, but are far more specific and zoned in.

            "content": "\"This happens...this is something that happens.\" This is a quote spoken from a character in Magnolia who's smarter then most of you getting ready to watch this film. When the twist occurs and you're left baffled think of this line because its true, this really is something that happens. Magnolia is a triumph for Paul Thomas Anderson that excels in the acting, music and script department. Critics and audiences a-like have labeled the ending \"cheating\" but that couldn't be further from reality. Once you're able to pick up on all the mise-en-scene, as well as the clues provided by the characters dialogue, the twist ending won't leave you pondering and the film will blossom into the beautiful Magnolia it deserves to be recognized as. In my review i'm going to supply you with the information that won't warrant multiple viewings and that will present the film at its most vulnerable areas of critiquing. Hopefully you'll realize why Paul Thomas Anderson-out of an amazing repertoire of films consisting of Boogie Nights, There Will Be Blood, and The Master-considers Magnolia his favourite film and why I recommend it to everyone who loves the magic of filmmaking. Now before I get there, heres a quick summary of Magnolia and the elements that left me amazed long after the credits finished rolling.\n\nMagnolia focuses on a bevy of different characters in LA over the course of a day. The entire film cuts back and forth between the characters and as the film nears its conclusion, connections through blood, coincidence, and chance link all of the characters together in one way or another. From the quick pan in and cutting montage intro you get a sense of the caliber of actors set to appear before you. Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John C Reilley, Phillip Baker Hall and Julian Moore are just a few of the bright faces gracing the film and each of them do phenomenal work bringing their characters to fruition. Taking the spotlight is Tom Cruise's performance which had me laughing and in shock. His introduction gives us the impression that he's a narcissistic pig invested in nothing but getting women, however as his character's developed and his true self is revealed, you realize that underneath him are issues stemming back to his childhood. Once his issues are confronted his oscar nomination speaks for itself and he gives in one of the most inspiring performances of his career. The theme of life long issues appears throughout Magnolia and it surprised me with the fabrication of an incredible performance from an actress I had otherwise never heard of. Melora Walter's performance left me floored and I only realized recently she worked on Paul Thomas Anderson's earlier film Boogie Nights. Revisiting her role in both films gave me a sense of her caliber as an actress, and her harsh interpretation of a cocaine addiction fuelled by family issues in Magnolia is riveting. Certainly the actors play a huge part in achieving the films aesthetic, but what gives Magnolia its pulse is its music.\n\nLike a rhythm the music sets the tone and pace for Magnolia. At the beginning it starts off in an intriguing fashion, with a symphony created to make you wonder about the characters and invest in all their stories. Once the character arcs have been set up, a new rhythm and pulse is inserted into the film and its effect is nothing short of enthralling. It takes on a darker tone but continues to make you wonder what the film is building towards. On another note Paul Thomas Anderson got a lot of inspiration for the film by listening to Aimee Mann's music and it comes as no surprise that she fills up most of the soundtrack. Her lovely voice is laced throughout the film lending Magnolia its sonic landscape and even earning Aimee an Oscar nomination for her original song \"save me\". Serving equal parts in creating Magnolia's landscape is the twist ending, however here are some things I wish I knew during my initial viewing.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson does his best to address the twist ending by lacing 82's in as many scenes as possible. These 82's appear for a reason and they serve the purpose of explaining the twist ending. Paul Thomas Anderson knew the film would build up towards the twist, but didn't know that the twist existed in the bible under exodus 8:2. Upon discovery with the help of a fellow actor, Paul Thomas Anderson began to implement his obsessive mise-en-scene of 82's and gave his twist further reason to exist within the film. Interestingly enough exodus 8:2 relates to many of the lines and themes that occur in the film-look for quiz kid Donnie's quoting of exodus 20:5 at the bar-and begs to contradict Paul Thomas Anderson's statement of not having known of exodus 8:2 before writing the script. This is one of the many things that assures the discussions for Magnolia will continue rolling long after it's unfolded before your eyes, and is further reason to regard the twist as pure genius.\n\nMagnolia has the courage of a director willing to make bold statements and in the end, the director is the one laughing in glee at what he's achieved. Paul Thomas Anderson says Magnolia is his favourite movie he's made and with the amazing repertoire he has under his belt, there's clearly a reason for that. Of course there are all the different elements like the acting, score, and script that give the movie its identity, but its all the work behind the scenes that makes Magnolia a film to cherish and pick apart for years to come. Realize that the director made choices for a reason and while they may leave a bad taste in your mouth, give them a chance. Paul Thomas Anderson has gifted us with a immensely layered film that without question deserves your viewership, just remember look out for the 82's and read into its meaning afterwards, you won't be disappointed. Magnolia comes highly recommended for anyone looking to sit back and absorb a powerful film by a legendary director.",

            "content": "One reason I adore Paul Thomas Anderson so much as a filmmaker is that each of his films is a completely different behemoth than the last. With Magnolia, Anderson finds himself expanding his oeuvre. While Boogie Nights was a tight, focused character drama, Magnolia is sprawling, dense, and quite lengthy piece of work that hints at the strong character relations that would characterize films like There Will Be Blood and The Master. It's ambitious, certainly - but it is better to have ambition and falter than to have no ambition at all.\n\nMagnolia being an ensemble film, it's important that the characters are intriguing, and luckily, the characters in this film are so well-rounded and realistic that you'll find yourself rooting for them to overcome their personal struggles despite their many vices. Julianne Moore plays a distraught woman caught in the most unfortunate of circumstances, and plays it wonderfully. Philip Seymour Hoffman is incredible as always. William H. Macy isn't weird as hell for once, and plays a down-on-his-luck child star who misses being something that mattered. The crowning performance of this film, however, is Tom Cruise's. I have always been skeptical of Cruise's acting ability - his acting has always been more serviceable to me than anything amazing, but with this film, he's proved me wrong. Cruise crafts one of his finest performances to date as Frank T.J. Mackey - a repulsive, arrogant, and slimy character who pitches a program for men to pick up women solely for sex. Yet there's a moment with him towards the film's climax that is so utterly devastating, you'll literally gasp in disbelief.\n\nYour overall enjoyment of Magnolia is contingent on many factors - whether you prefer your movies taut or sprawling, how you react to the improbable occurrence that transpires three-fourths into the film, and, more insignificantly - if you like Aimee Mann or not; but what makes Magnolia so solidly engrossing and ultimately harrowing is its writing. Lines like \"These are things that happen\", \"This is the scene of the movie where you help me out\", or even \"I really do have love to give; I just don't know where to put it\" (delivered by a teary-eyed Donnie Smith) are just a few of the phenomenal lines included in Magnolia. More than anything, the writing articulates our innate desire to want strange and explainable occurrences in life to make sense, especially in the bizarre opening of the film.\n\nThe pitfall of Magnolia, however, is that it can be a bit self-indulgent at times. Like I mentioned before, there's a specific circumstance in the film - you'll know it when you see it - that will make or break the film for you. It's certainly a grand visual and emotional spectacle, which is funny, because it's certainly not the defining, cathartic moment you'd expect from a film that has been hitherto dark and upsetting. I think I enjoyed this sequence because of how it subverted expectations: you're led to believe that these characters' lives will intertwine in an organic, meaningful way, but it's just frogs. And that is wonderful.\n\nThere are also times when the film can get a bit slow, especially if you're not as fond of certain characters (I personally wasn't too keen on the Gators, and no, not alligators, that's their last name) as you are of others, but for the most part, it's wonderful that a film of this length can keep you interested for this long, especially if it's an original film. Also, like many Paul Thomas Anderson's films, the movie is just so invigorating that it has trouble ending on a fitting note, ending somewhat abruptly even though we just spent three hours with these characters and want some sort of resolution. \n\nMagnolia has plenty of redeeming value, though, and I exhort you to see it when you get the chance; especially if you're that weird type that feels nothing in real life and relies on movies for emotional sustenance. It's highly original, thought-provoking, emotional, and even quite entertaining. Just watch out for the frogs.",

The overall theme of the film is the parent-child relationship but it has so much more than just that. It's a film about fate versus the will of God, and humanity's endless search for true love, whether that be a romantic love or otherwise. A cinematic landmark that, in my mind anyway, ranks with such films as The Godfather and Citizen Kane. One of the greatest films ever made!",

Look I really wanted to love this movie, but I have no idea what the hell I'm supposed to enjoy here. Roger Ebert, whose opinion I take very seriously, gave it 4 stars (out of 4) and put it in his great films section, so that sets my expectations pretty high. If anyone can tell me what the whole point of this was, please let me know. I would like to watch this again to see if I can appreciate it more, but at the current moment I could give a fuck about that.

No. The film has great characters and intertwining stories that are intentionally biblical. However, that's where the film loses points for me. Even though the whole frogs raining was intentional, it took me out of the movie. I love Paul Thomas Anderson's films, it's just with this one, it lost it's impact when it stumbled into preposterous territory. The performances are as solid as you would expect in an Anderson film, but i just wish the film was as great as Anderson intended it to be.

They are all connected in one way or another, either by coincidence or otherwise and all deal with intricate and painful family relationships. The characters are as real, honest, good, bad and messed up as they come. John C. Reilly. William H. Macy, Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise (just to name a few) perform them all exceptionally well.\n\nAnother memorable part of this movie is the great soundtrack, especially the songs by Aimee Mann and Jon Brion.

The frog rain certainly leaves no question as to where the final ending is, but I was definitely curious if we were ever going to get there.\nQuips aside, like all Anderson films it is gorgeous to look at and impeccably made on all levels. And it is only surpassed on this technical level by the outstanding acting delivered from everyone on the stunning cast.

From Cruise's bombastic misogynist to Reilly's insecure cop to Moore's unbalanced wife, every actor is perfectly cast and directed, thanks to Anderson's steady vision. It seems that at any time that Anderson could have let the film go too far in any direction, whether that be melodrama (see: Crash), self-importance, or even flippancy, but he tautly keeps all of the storylines moving toward the unexpected conclusion, preferring never to take the easy route and give simple answers. Many of the characters do not have storylines that are resolved on screen, but it feels like it would have been out of character with the point of the film to do so; it is better that, although there is some resolution, we are left with some open ends, and arguably more questions than answers, because that's how life works, even in the presence of very strange phenomena. This was my second time watching this film, and I just may need to put it in more regular rotation because it has so much depth.

Although, There Will Be Blood is a modern classic and one of my favorite films of all time. But I think that Magnolia is his most personal work, it is the film where you see most clearly into the magnificent writer/director's mind and outlook on the world. The film depicts, like many of Anderson's films, famlial dysfunction, loneliness, and in the style of Ingmar Bergman, human isolation. However, he weaves this very complex and intricate screenplay into a coherent and poignant study of a world connected by chance and common human characteristics, but one in which people are incapable of any real human connection. Well everyone except children, who are the only selfless characters in the picture, but Anderson shows us\n how children lose that selflessness and innocence quickly in a world run by money and egotism. Anderson also utilizes constant camera motion to emphasize that this world is not a dull, monotonous world, but one that is constantly moving and in action. It is honestly, his most artistic and experimental film; he does not confine himself to the normal formulaic Hollywood story. The film also features a wonderful ensemble cast with remarkable performances from Cruise, Reilly, Hoffman, Moore, and Macy; many of Anderson's films have large ensemble casts of great actors, but his real gift is his ability to pull great performances out of them without them overshadowing anyone else, which is the sign of any great ensemble cast. This is a beautiful film, one of my favorites of the 90's, and a film everyone should watch.",

The Performances of John C. Reilly, Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise are the best performances of the picture. This film is a brilliantly crafted masterpiece that is really touching, and shows that human beings need to help one another and that we must forgive. This Film should have gotten a Best Picture Nomination, a Best Director nomination and a Best Supporting Actor Nomination to John C. Reilly to go along with the 3 that it got for Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor (Cruise) and Best Song (Save Me- by Aimee Mann).

Anderson would hone his craft in his future work, but with Magnolia we get to see a director creating something unique. Anderson has always been one of the finer directors who are able to craft quality films with great casts of talented actors. Magnolia is a sweeping movie that intertwines the lives of different people into a powerful story. I really loved the film, but I just don't feel that it is Thomas Anderson's best. He would later make the far superior Boogie Nights and There Will Be Blood. But Magnolia is a fine film that should appeal to viewers looking for a well directed picture that tells a good story. Is it the sweeping masterpiece that viewers have claimed it to be? No, it isn't, but it is worth seeing, and Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is wonderful and he tells an interesting story that is dark and intense. A theme that seems to pop out constantly throughout the film is finding happiness and hope. Magnolia draws its strength from its captivating performances from the cast, and each brings something wonderful to the screen. Although not perfect, Magnolia is a well executed picture that tells a solid story. This is a must see film for fans of the director, and it is a well paced film that you soon won't forget. The cast is what makes this one overcome its shortcomings, and the best actors here that have impressed me are Julianne Moore, John C. Reilley   and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I liked Tom Cruise, but I simply thought he was a bit overdoing it in his performance. Magnolia is worth seeing, but like I previously stated, Anderson would later mature as a director with more interesting films that really pushed the envelope even further.",

            "content": "\"This happens. This is something that happens.\"\r\n\r\nFor that film quote above, I'd apply it to P.T Anderson making a great film. About 10 months after witnessing the brilliant film Magnolia, I found myself using my computer and coming across a forum on a different website where someone asked other people what the worst film ever was. One guy said Movie 43. Another guy said any Tyler Perry film (except I Can Do Bad All By Myself and Peeples). And yet another guy said either the Uwe Boll video game adaptions Alone in the Dark and Postal (TIE) or Epic Movie (or any Friedberg & Seltzer film, since they're all in the same level of bad). There was even a whole argument and ultimate debate about which Scary Movie installment was the worst behind the fifth one. I commented, saying the worst film ever was Vampire Sucks. And even if all this one forum bystander had to do was agree with everything anybody said, he still posted, \"Really? Silent Hill/Resident Evil/Disaster Movie/Alex Cross/A Haunted House wasn't THAT bad. If you know what the meaning of the worst film ever is, you'd pick Magnolia.\" He also said something about Apocalypse Now and Suspiria, but at that point I didn't care. His first pick was Magnolia? Of all films, you had to pick the best achievement of Paul Thomas Anderson since Boogie Nights? When I first watched The Master, I thought it wasn't really as great as everyone made it out to be, so I thought the same thing about P.T. Anderson. But this was a film that made me change my whole opinion about him. During that time I thought people who had dissenting opinions were just trolls, and I also thought that you can actually be completely anonymous on the internet, so I didn't hold back in what I posted against him or her. When I first watched Magnolia, I was cut off from being able to finish it. Like a few of my favorites, I felt mixed feelings towards the parts of the film I already watched. I thought it had too much vulgar language and over the top characters. But watching it again a few months later, I thought that I should finish the films I watched for once. So I started with this one. Let's start with the stories. I thought the stories were very simple, even if they were about some not-so-ordinary people (a lonely cop, a drug addict, a dying and possibly pedophilic game show host, a young game show contestant, his abusive father, a gay former game show contestant, a dying televsion producer, his caring male nurse, the said dying television producer's worried and formerly manipulative wife, and a vulgar and self-proclaimed motivational speaker, who specifically motivates and even instructs men how to seduce women). In fact, these stories are so simple, I wonder why I felt a sense of suspense and thrill when I was watching. You'd think that an ordinary moviegoer would have that kind of feeling when watching an Alfred Hitchock Presents episode, but I instead felt that feeling while watching this particular film. One would ask, \"How can Paul Thomas Anderson handle all these stories?\", and some people, like the bystander above, would say, \"That's the thing. That's why this film is bad. That's why people who like this film can only be called blind. He can't.\". But I say differently. All these intertwined stories performed perfectly on their own. But during that climactic event (which I won't give away) that brought all of these briiliant and formerly independent stories together, it only showed how great they work as a team. I'm older now, and I try to watch this film at least once every year. Unlike other films (Disaster Movie, The Last Airbender, The Dark Knight), my opinion of this film never changed. And I think I like it that way.",

            "content": "With its strange narration and random historical occurrences in the beginning of the film, following then with an introduction of 6,7, or 8 different characters, one may wonder how this movie is going to make any sense and come together. But Magnolia ultimately develops into a story of heartbreak. Heartbreak from the hands of BAD PARENTING. \"Subtle abuse\", sexual abuse, physical abuse, adultery, and father just plain not being there. All of these wounded characters wound up revealing the reasons for their pain in the end. What marked their revelations was the sudden froggy rainfall. In biblical times, God warned the people of Egypt with a downpour of amphibians. I think it symbolized some sort of a wake up call in this movie as well for our characters. All of these twisted, torn lives were spared because of what this miraculous storm did. It affected some directly and some indirectly. There were two troubled \"game show kids\", one being the troubled \"know it all\" with the loveless, neglectful father, and William H. Macy being what that child will ultimately become. His neglect and betrayal from his parents destroyed his confidence and caused him to suffer for many years with his sexuality. During his drunken monologue at the bar, he mentioned to the older gay gentlemen that \"No, it is not dangerous to confuse children with angels\". This seemed to be another running theme in the movie. I personified some characters with angels and some characters with children. And after a Google search, I found that pink Magnolia flowers represent innocence and youth added with joy. Well the joy must have come after our characters were able to come to grips with their misgivings and verbalize their mistakes. The joy came after the people survived their near death experiences. The joy came after this miraculous storm from God changed everyone's lives. John C. Reilly seemed to become Claudia's angel, as she struggled with her addictions stemming from her sexual abuse from her father, (and neglect from her alcoholic mother for not knowing or doing anything about the perpetrator living in her own house). As an adult, Claudia was stuck in a child like phase, clinging to mommy in the storm, acting and behaving recklessly like a heartbroken teenager. You would think a straight-edge cop with a gun and a loyalty to the law would not mix well with a poor, crazy white hoe with a cocaine problem. But the Magnolia flower blooms for them both in the end. And Tom Cruise, the seducer and destroyer of women. In his father's final moment, we saw him shaking, clenching his fists, tears strolling down his cheeks as he cursed his father. At that moment, he is finally breaking free from the emotional and psychological bondage that he had suffered under since a 14 year old boy. He was able to get all of  his rage out and be there with his father during his final breaths. This experience would have never happened if it weren't for the hospice worker, (seymour hoffman), with his empathy for the dying man's wishes and his determination to track down his lost son. His experience through this storm seemed to make him a part of the family. I love a movie with a big cast like this, especially one that garnishes career defining and memorable performances, (Gacy, Cruise, Reilly, Melinda Dillon, and the bitchy Julianne Moore). 3 hours + is a long time to sit and watch a film nowadays. There are few movies that are so captivating that 3 hours pass by and you don't even realize it. When all of the characters broke into song 2 hours and 45 minutes into the film I couldn't help but shout obscenities into the air. There probably was a point to that song and everybody singing those depressing lyrics while they loathed in their own misery, but i didn't care enough to find out why or think about it for more than a minute. Also, I am not a fan of most child actors. I have to say that this movie had some of the worst, most irritating children actors. The little black kid was cute, and important to the story with his innocent little heart and his gangsta ways, but he can't rap! the lyrics were deep, much deeper than anyone his age could have ever crafted, but then again, that was another recurring theme in the movie, children with gifts. Intelligent, amazing children with big hearts but little love from the outside. The love and attention they did get was superficial and didn't last long. Putting all of the factors that I disliked about this movie on a scale and weighing them against all of the things I absolutely loved, this movie tips in the favor of love over hate. I consider this a well written, directed, and acted movie, (other than those godforsaken kids). The infamous raining frog scene is unforgettable and important for movies of this measure. Those WTF! moments are the ones that keep you talking and thinking about the film and ultimately coming back to it. 4/5",

The premise is pretty much a bunch of extremely dramatic stories thrown into one film, and they are all very interesting. The stories are only made better by the incredible performances driving them: it is excruciatingly rare for a film to have this many universally amazing performances. The best of them all would have to be Tom Cruise as an eccentric motivational speaker, who slowly unravels into the most broken of men in a single two-minute scene between him and his father. This is by far the best performance I've ever seen Cruise pull off. The film is overflowing with meaning and metaphor, and I think it would be impossible to fully understand and take everything in the first time around; after all, it's a three-hour film.

I didn't get it the first time, but the second time I found it really interesting.  Its extremely bizarre quirky style is just part of what makes director Paul Thomas Anderson unique.  Directors and screenwriters like Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, and Charlie Kaufman have invented their own unique genre in film.  You have to analyze their films to get why they were made, and to understand what they want you to understand.  Though films like Magnolia are really bizarre they are much more thoughtful then the average blockbuster.  That is why I appreciate films like this.\n\nThe film is revolved around several characters, and several stories that are happening at once.  It isn't one that I could give a good synopsis for that you would have a good expectation for what the film will be about.  It is about several different characters going through different kinds of crisis.  It is a psychological drama that leads you all over the place, and eventually connects the stories.\n\nFrank \"T.J.\" Mackey (Tom Cruise) runs a program called \"Seduce and Destroy\" that helps men get girlfriends.  Seduce and Destroy is a very famous program that has helped many men.  He is famous because of it.  His father Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) is dying of cancer.  He is being taken care of by Phil Parma (Phillip Seymour Hoffman).  Linda Partridge (Julianne Moore) is his trophy wife works on getting his prescription for morphine while Phil takes care of him, and tries to get in touch with his son Frank.  Frank is in the middle of one of his Seduce and Destroy seminars while Phil anxiously tries to get in touch with him. \n\nOfficer Jim Kurring (John C. Rielly) is sent to investigate a disturbance, and he finds a body, and a boy tries to tell him who did it by rapping to him.  He then goes to Claudia Wilson Gator's (Melora Walters) house, who is a cocaine addict to investigate another disturbance.  He ends up asking her out on a date.  Claudia Wilsons father Jimmy Gator (Phillip Baker Hall) is a game-show host, and he is also dying.  The show he hosts the show \"What do kids know?\" \n\nThe film tells the stories of all different kinds of people.  From ordinary people to celebrities, and to people that are on drugs or dying.  Frank \"T.J.\" Mackey and Jimmy Gator are the two celebrities in the story.  They are both on TV, but they are both completely different people.  Jimmy is like another version of his father.  Like Frank's father Jimmy is dying, and he also cheated on his wife at some point.  His child Claudia also hates him, as Frank hates his father.  That is the similarity between Earl Partridge, and Jimmy Gator.  They don't actually connect to each other in the story, but there is just a similarity between the two.\n\nThe story shows how relationships between parents and their kids will affect them.  I feel like Frank is this really eccentric guy, and very weird partly because of how what his father did to him earlier in his life effected him.  Claudia was affected really badly, and I felt like her cocaine addiction is to help escape her messed up life, and the pain of whatever her father did.  Even the kid on the show \"What do kids know?\" has a ruthless father.  The kid is Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman), and you can tell how pressured he is by his father.  It is just another aspect that shows how parents affect their kids.  I feel like that is the part of the story that Paul Thomas Anderson wanted the audience to think about when he wrote the screenplay.\n\nI feel like I should give a lot of credit to Tom Cruise for his performance.  There were a lot of good performances in this movie, but his probably comes to my mind first.  He had to take on a very eccentric and weird character that was full of energy.  The type of character that you would have to really invest yourself in so you could pull it off right.  I also feel like Tom Cruise is a very eccentric guy in real life so he was just a good fit for the role, and a great casting choice.  I am not always a fan of his, but I felt like this was one of his best performances.\n\nThis was a really good intellectual movie that joined several stories perfectly.  It is great writing, and directing.  Paul Thomas Anderson created something completely original, and unique with magnolia.  What he created with the film is very weird, but interesting and though provoking.  It is one that if you didn't like the first time I would recommend watching again, because you may like it more.  That was what happened with this film and I.  Weird intellectual movies like I feel like are only for a certain audience.  They are more for an audience that analyzes films, and notices specific details that the director probably was hoping you would notice.  I am a part of that audience so I really liked this film.  I would say that it is the best film that Paul Thomas Anderson made or at least one of the best.",

Tom Cruise doesn't take the lead role, I guess all of the actors in this movie are the main charaters but Tom Cruise had one of the most important characters of the movie, so I can say that he's the main actor in this movie, I think he was nominated for an Oscar, I'm not sure if he actually won the Oscar, but I loved his character and his perfomance, Tom is known from Mission Impossible, Knight and Day, Riscky Bussiness, Jerry Maguire, Tropic Thunder and much other movies. Julianne Moore is one of my favorite actresses, but her role in this movie was no big deal, I mean, she was not on the screen that much time, but from what I saw she was just okay, she had a nice perfomance and a nice character, Julianne is known from some episodes of the TV show 30 Rock, from the movies Crazy Stupid Love, Chloe and much other titles. Phillips Seymor Hoffman was in this movie and I really appreciatted his acting and his character, he was one of the best guys who showed up in Magnolia, Phillip is known from Capote, The Ides of March, The Big Lebowsky and some other movies. Jonh C. Reilly also had one of my favorite perfomances in this flick, I really liked his character and he an excellent perfomance in this movie, Jonh is known from Cyrus, Step Brothers, Cedar Rapids and some other titles. The rest of the main cast was completed by William H. Macy, wich character I enjoyed, the rest of the cast is not completed by much known actors but there were some fine perfomances. Overall, I really liked the cast.\n\nSeveral diferent persons connect in some way, and all of them creat a mosaic of persons who are looking for redemption and happiness. Sow, it's hard to write the actual plot of the movie, I wood have to right several lines for that, but I can say that this movie had a very interesting plot, it was deep and complex, really deep in did and still very complex too, but all of yur questions will be answered while the movie is developing. The movie follows several diferent persons, and it also has romance, so don't think that this is just a movie that it's filled with awesome and several stars and then the movie just shows 20 minutes of each character's life, because it doesn't this movie needed to dure three hours, that way, none of those things happened right? I notticed that and I felt good about it.\n\nSoundtrack, the soundtrack was really good, I really liked it and I payed attention to it. Now, this movie is really long, right, but it just needed to be and I already explained why, so I don't care if it lasted three hours, I was a bit bored by be sitting on the couch for so much time, but it was worth it, let me tell you why, one of the reasons I already said, other reason is that I only felt a little bored when this movie reached two and a half hour, because it was starting to become a little long, but that's okay, you gotta see it until the end to release that this movie had to be long and it woodn't be so good as it is if it wasn't.\n\nBesides all that, I am now going to tell you what i really thought about this movie. First of all, I was a bit dissapointed, the beginning was being the highlight of the movie, the guy who suicided and was shot while he was falling from the building, I think that part of the story was going to have a bigger development and a conclusion, it had sort of a coonclusion at the end, but no so good as I thought. Well, this is obviously the longest movie I have ever seen, and it was really deep, I didn't knew that I plot like this cood make this movie turn into deep, it's also confusing and complex to understand, the rain frog at the end was really good but still hard to understand, everyone in this movie is mysterious and has lots of secrets, what makes the movie being very mysterious. Lots of people hated it and lots of people loved it, I just loved it, but I don't think this is the best movie ever made, yes it disirved the 235 place at the IMDb Top 250 list, but I expected a little more from it. But that's okay, I liked a lot, some people like it less and I understand that, but you got to see the deepness of the movie, you have to see how wonderfuly the main characters are connected and other special things about it. Overall, I liked this movie a lot, there were amazing perfomances, it had a really nice plot and it can make fun of your emotions with just three long hours, be prepared to feel lots of things while you watch it. The longest movie I have ever seen, but also one of the best movie I have ever seen, really good. Masterpiece.\n\nMasterpiece work. Very recommended movie. Grade: A.",

Includes some of Anderson's long time collaborators and big name stars who can thank the opprotunity to work with such a brilliant film maker. Its hard to think whats the moral or main concern? and how all the narratives connect that lead up the final scenes/event. The film is incredibly entertaining, insightful and inspiring and very long at 3 hours. Its memorable for its incredible performances by the actors, Anderson's script and Bold Direction. Far from being a masterpiece but more closer to being the ambitious arthouse blockbuster of 90s cinema.",

            "content": "I don't really have much doubt that this is a good movie. However, as many people regard this movie as one of the best movies of 1999, I'm not really sure what to think or say about it, specially with all the aggression that comes with criticizing an (possibly, I'm not sure) over-hyped movie (this is for sure not the best movie of 99 for me).\n\nThe way the plot is conducted (and all of the interconnections between the characters, which is something the director establishes as one of the main points of the movie right in the beginning), the editing and acting are really superb, but I have 2 main complains about it. I really don't care much about Academy Awards, but the nomination for Tom Cruise is SO wrong. There is so much good acting in this movie, and they nominate Tom Cruise? Isn't that weird? (I'm not saying that he isn't good, he is actually very nice in this movie, but from all of the actors he is definitely the worst). Apart from that, the other thing that bothered me is that this movie takes itself too seriously, and this is a movie that shouldn't be doing that (I don't really think that ANY movie should do that). It takes itself as deep and meaningful, trying to be an 'artsy' movie, but it's actually somewhat shallow, not really overly complicated (as it clearly wanted to be), and I really think it relies a lot on hype for its fame (I have my reasons to believe that and they're all easily identifiable elements of the movie, but this is a spoiler-free review so figure it out yourself). This movie isn't half as deep as American Beauty, a movie that was released in the same year and in which you can really connect and be moved by the characters, so it baffles me how people think so high about Magnolia. Nevertheless, this is a very well executed (albeit shallow) movie and, despite the long running time, worth a watch. I'm not sure about seeing it again, though.",

Made to be overwhelming, this is a film that will feel like too much to handle, and will take multiple viewings to appreciate and notice every single shot, if you somehow have the time for that. Anderson was noted as saying this is the best film he will ever make, and I think I can understand why he would have said this in 1999, though I am confident he would disagree with this previously stated claim if he were to reflect on it today. In my opinion, he said this because it is so tightly interwoven and sharply edited that it comes across as the most epic dramatic piece you will ever see, and from the creators eyes may seem like his masterpiece. Although a pretty damn good film, it is not even close to Anderson's best work, as there is at least 45 minutes of film that could have been left out for the viewers sake. I would recommend seeing at least once just so you can experience a film unlike any other that has ever been made.",

Paul Thomas Anderson directs this masterpiece with impeccable skill and cinematic vision. He uses vivid imagery and dark comedy with absolutely fantastic plot structure and progression. The most noteworthy performances by this incredible ensemble are Philip Seymour Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Cruise performs with such skillful acting mastery and beautifully timed vulgarity. Hoffman's dialogue felt very natural and well written, not to say that the entire film wasn't well written. It has countless subliminal messages about the masks put on by members of our society. Many of the film's elements are almost quite operatic. Lots of people are turned off to this movie due to its 3 hour length but you cannot be turned off for that reason alone. Hands down one of the greatest films ever made!",

Not in the bad, dragging way, but you can feel how long it is. However, I did like the three act structure it had going on, and how each section has its own arc within the whole. Really smart writing and directing there. The way all of these interconnected people's stories weave in and out of each other is nothing short of masterful. It's a little scattered and confusing in the beginning, but once you get about twenty minutes in, everything starts to click, and it just keeps going from there. So, nice job from Paul Thomas Anderson on that. The ensemble cast is wonderful to watch. Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy, and more. Tom Cruise? I think this is the best thing I've seen him in. Overall, this is one of those \"I really liked it, but I don't know if I would watch it again\" type movies. You know what I mean? But. It is definitely worth that first watch.",

            "content": "I've seen Magnolia now four times and it's still hard to say do I like or not. It's a 3-hour, multidimensional drama and certainly writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's most ambitious work to date. Unfortunately ambitious to a fault.\n\nAnderson's career has been very interesting. His two first films, Boogie Nights and this one (I'm excluding Hard Eight because I still haven't seen it and it got so little attention overall) were giant, lengthy films with many characters, stories and ensemble casts. But in 2002 with \"Punch-Drunk Love\" at the latest, his style changed radically into a more small-scale direction (but not less ambitious). Since then he has made films with much smaller casts and more linear stories.\n\nBoogie Nights was an excellent film. The period piece was created precisely, the plot moved fluently and the actors were terrific. But I still think it's probably a good thing that Anderson's style changed massively, because I think that with Magnolia things got a little out of hand. The stumbling block was of course his ambition. There is simply too much material here and the film isn't able to carry all the way to the end. Especially somewhere before the final hour, during Jason Robards' repentant speech the film starts to bore. Some of the stories are quite uninteresting and some characters annoying. The usage of music has also been one the strength of Anderson's films, but here, especially during the first hour, Aimee Mann's music playing constantly on the background quickly starts to numb you.\n\nThe film still manages to keep you interested most of the time. Anderson carries the film presentably, and powerfully deals with themes of family, love, loneliness, coincidence and fate. The thematic unity of the film is a TV quiz show which many of the stories revolve around, and it's very compelling to see how such an insignificant thing has affected the lives of the characters. There are also some very powerful individual scenes, like the one where Tom Cruise's character goes to see his father. It's a truly emotionally powerful encounter.\n\nAnd like all of Anderson's films, the acting is monumental. To me, Cruise is the one who truly stands out here with one of the greatest performances of his career, but Philip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reilly, Melora Walters and William H. Macy are all great as well. Julianne Moore is a very talented actor, but here she occasionally overacts quite annoyingly.\n\nThough many consider this as Anderson's magnum opus (including the director himself), I think this isn't one of his strongest works. It isn't a bad film at all, but as a whole it doesn't have the kind of suction like his best works like Boogie Nights, There Will Be Blood and The Master.",

The last hour could have easily been cut off. What bothered me most about it is how much potential it had, and how quickly it changed into something to loathe for. There is a scene involving a highly intelligent boy named Stanley on a game show, right at the scene where he rebels against how he is treated because of his knowledge is where the film begins to fall. From there on, instead being a refreshing venture, Anderson's \"Magnolia\" becomes increasingly melodramatic and predictable. I won't go through all of the characters, but I will say there are mishaps in the writing where three different characters confess to a fellow loved one or caretaker that they have cheated on their spouse. Was this intentional or just poor writing? I found it repetitive; it was almost like I was seeing the same scene again. Sure, the film is about coincidences, it still did not work. I was very impressed with Tom Cruise's performance after his not so good showing in \"Minority Report,\" except for one sequence where he tries to cry, instead starts shaking; I found it unintentionally funny. Julian Moore as Linda, the woman who married Tom Cruise (Mackey)'s father for money is good in the beginning; however she gradually starts to overact, which becomes ridiculous. Two performances I really admired were of John C. Reilly (a cop) and William H. Man, a former champion of the kids game show, who now is looking for love and decides he wants to get braces to impress the person he as a crush on, who has braces. Anderson does not supply with a base for his characters and their relationships. For example: Moore's character Linda now realizes she loves Earl Partridge (father of Cruise's Mackey), while he is on his death bed. I felt that her admitting and realizing was not even developed, it was highly unconvincing. Same for Reilly (cop)'s relationship with Claudia, a drug addict. The performances along with the writing and editing are to blame; I see it as an unpolished work. There is a larger amount of pretentious lecturing and less of authenticity. The frog gimmick could not have saved what was already a demoralizing film. The first hour and half, maybe more is terrific. Plus, I found it to be very funny and entertaining, too bad it didn't last. \"There Will Be Blood,\" the only other I've seen of Anderson is great.",

Tom Cruise, however, was brilliant.  It will be another 10 years before I watch \"Magnolia\" again... I forgot how gut wrenching and anxiety provoking it was....",

            "content": "In Magnolia, P.T. Anderson gives us something we seldomly see on screen. Three epic hours of human conflict and relationships.\nThree hours for a Robert Altman-style drama sounds like a long time but the film flies by and keeps you at the edge of your seat for most of the time.\n\nSuch an ambitious project wouldn't work with the right crew though but Anderson did a great job in finding the right actors for his characters thus assembled a star-studded cast. Tom Cruise got much of the attention, a bunch of awards and universal praise for his role, and deservingly so, but imo John C. Reilly is even better here. He plays an honest, dutiful cop with a big big heart and his scenes with Melora Walters are some of the best of the film.\nWalters herself is also pretty darn good as the estranged daughter of a game show host with a dark past that led to cocaine addiction.\nHer father is played by Philip Baker Hall, who plays the old dying husband/father/game show host (I haven't seen too many films with him but it seems like he's playing this role for over 10 years now...). He's one of the standouts as well.\n\nI also liked Jeremy Blackman as one of the child contestants in Hall's show and Philip Seymour Hoffman who's as great as anyone as the nurse of Cruise's father.\n\nAs I list the different characters here you start to get an idea of how brilliantly connected all the storylines are, and yet, Magnolia never gets confusing thanks to excellent directing by Anderson. I guess, one of the reasons why it never bores you despite its runtime are the switches from one plot to another while never losing the golden thread.\n\nAmbition and execution met here on a very high level and I recommend this little flick to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.",
