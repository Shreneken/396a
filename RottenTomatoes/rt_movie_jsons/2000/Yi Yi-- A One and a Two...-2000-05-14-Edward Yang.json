The time of crafting a 3 hour movie where there is no second-act crescendo, where the entire first 2.5 hours are just pure exposition and the last half hour can only loosely be described as the climax… that time is over, if it ever even really began. I'm not saying the craftsmanship (at least as far as human drama goes) was anything less than top notch, it's just that what they chose to create was borderline unwatchable. My interest in the characters waned instead of waxed as the second hour passed by with very little happening and I kept hoping the grandma would go ahead and die so there would at least be some burst of emotion. The worst part was how well they had started out, with some really excellent music from what sounded like a viola playing over an exciting wedding scene, as what that scene ultimately accomplished was displaying to the audience what movie they were capable of making (i.e. one worth watching), making the final product even more frustrating. My patience was long gone by the time they nailed the coffin shut by spending several minutes showing a guy explain why people enjoy movies. The notion that this is \"one of the great works of 21st century cinema\" is as foreign to me as the language they were speaking.",

The fact that it clocks in at just under three hours may be a deterrent to some, but the film is so meticulously crafted, well written and superbly acted that you become totally immersed in the issues that impact the family.  Yang blocks each scene perfectly, allowing the primarily stationary camera to document the emotions of the characters and their interpersonal relationships in lengthy, uninterrupted takes, often to devasting effect.  It is a profound but subtle exploration of human nature that will linger in the memory long after the film has ended.",

Takes are long and deliberate, of varying distances from the subject, often wordless and introspective, and dialogue is filled with authenticity, including wonderfully awkward pauses and hesitation. Yang is the master of 'empty' space, allowing atmosphere to hang heavy in the air like honey and for conversations to appear appropriately sporadic and impactful. I think that allowing his \"less is more\" style to extend to a greater proportion of the plot allows for a Yang to craft a greater impact than his other highly acclaimed masterpiece, A Brighter Summer Day, which shares a setting and many stylistic elements but tackles different elements of Taiwanese society; the films have enough power to stand on their own without resorting to using a violent act as a pivot. Still, an endearingly sincere classic of world cinema that maanges to effectively combine domestic commentary with global empathy. (5/5)",

            "content": "I often find Taiwanese movies inaccessible and trying to one's patience. They tend to be long, slow-paced, focus on an extended family, introduce many characters at once, employ few close ups (making it hard to distinguish those characters), depict the mundane, no \"plot,\" minimalist soundtrack. Yi Yi follows those conventions, but does so in a way that slowly draws you in and doesn't let go of your attention. I won't give away what actually happens in the movie, as much of the pleasure in watching it is in discovering the meaning as events unfold. The experience of watching this movie is like being an unobserved anthropologist viewing an extended family (and their neighbors) from a distance. You go in with no context, and rely on your own observation skills to get to know the characters, figure out the relationships and the meaning of events. As you slowly fill in the context and meaning, previous events that were perplexing come into relief, and you begin to appreciate their significance. In a sense, the experience of watching the movie isn't over when the closing credits begin. The following day I had \"a ha!\" moments as I suddenly put two and two together thinking back on the film.\n\n(One thing that amused me in the movie was when a couple teens meet at a movie theater, they stand in front of a poster for The Phantom Menace, which is another long movie about an extended family with no plot, both made by a single visionary writer/director, but is also loud and obnoxious, and turns you away, despite its desperate attempts to be engaging, and you can't help but notice the difference.)",

Alas, I can't even say that I liked it!\n\nTwo main reasons this film didn't resonate with me nearly as much as I expected are that: I didn't find the vast majority of the characters to be interesting, and I couldn't see why this is considered to be a slice-of-life film in the first place.\n\nThe only character I was almost constantly interested in is Yang-Yang. I found the relationship between N.J. and Sherry quite absorbing and engrossing as well as the scenes with N.J. and his Japanese friend; I can't say I really cared about the character of N.J. as I was supposed to be.\n\nI couldn't care less about everything related to N.J.'s wife, teenage daughter, brother and business partners. Apart from one scene N.J.'s wife shares with N.J.'s mother that was a bit emotional, I found the film emotionally flat and almost fell asleep every time I see these above-mentioned characters. I found the story-line of Ting-Ting to be one of the most boring and uneventful I've seen in any film. Let alone the fact this film is 3 hours long!\n\nA slice-of-life is a term used to describe a piece of art or literature that shows or depicts the ordinary details of real life. And I'm enamored of any film or novel that can be classified under this, so to speak, sub-genre. The thing is I couldn't see that Yi Yi fits this description. What I saw, in the first 30 minuted in particular, are many of uninteresting characters acting in an absurd way. I really couldn't see that this film has mundane real-life events as most people do.\n\n(6.5/10)",

            "content": "For films like this, it is actually unnecessary to \"review\" or \"analyse\", as nothing is more common in the world than the humanist care that people give each other. By that, of course I do not mean that \"Yi Yi\" is a perfect film, as it is surely less accessible than the great works by Edward Yang's compatriot - Ang Lee, whose view and thoughts are equally humanist but more \"global\" (some may say \"Westernised\"). Luckily enough for me, being born in the \"Sinosphere\", Edward Yang's \"Yi Yi\" to me is utterly oriental with a deeply Buddhist sense of Prat?tyasamutpada, in simpler words the close and dependent relationship between people, between past and present, between life and death. The way Edward Yang unveiled his interconnected layers of human stories in \"Yi Yi\" is utterly charming, soothing, yet it still makes the audience delightfully surprised by the subtle reflection of one generation's destiny on its successor's, by numerous abrupt turns or terminations of such stories, often through obscurity and blurriness of details. I was deeply fascinated by the fact that Edward Yang in some cases concealed important details or outcomes of his stories from the audience, or only let them know in a very \"hear-say\", indirect ways that really reflect the fact that as our back (the physical back that is), there are plenty of things in life that we cannot see, ever, just like the future, just like how people really think about us, just like our ultimate destiny in life, no matter how wise we are, no matter how \"far-sight\" we try to be. Thus, the best thing we can do is to \"cover\" the back of our beloved ones by our love, true love, just like the small but ever wise Yang-Yang, who in his simple but dearest way takes pictures of whom he loves, from their back, so that they would never have to die without knowing how their back really looks like. It was a huge lost to the Taiwanese cinema, and the global cinema actually, when Yang died too early from cancer, but he will always be remembered for his humanist films, especially this \"Last Bow\", the best \"bow\" possible to the audience that is.",

            "content": "Holy cow! I think I just discovered the movie that Richard Linklater watched when he came up with the idea for Boyhood. This is a 3-hour-long plod through a year in the life of a Taiwanese family. The reason I bring up the Boyhood comparison is because Yi Yi is also kind of like watching a family's home-movies, but not the exciting moments that you would actually videotape. Instead this is loaded with the down moments, and also a bunch of bland scenes where nothing of interest happens. It has some scenes that are promising and make you think something really dramatic is about to happen, at these moments I got my hopes up that the movie was about to take a turn to be really intriguing. Sadly, before long the drama peters out and they go back to depicting the mundane aspects of everyday existences. Towards the end of the film, when it teased me again in this way, I literally said out loud \"There's no way anything this interesting will happen in this movie.\" Sure enough, it was just another fake-out and all the excitement was gone in a flash.\n\nThere are other issues as well. One more aspect that reminded me of Boyhood was the way they had young people sharing conversations that no one their age would ever have. In fact the youngest member of the family has more profound lines than anyone else in the movie. It just feels too scripted, particularly in a movie that is attempting to capture real life. My other difficulty with Yi Yi was the shot selection. Edward Yang seemingly enjoys setting the camera down on a tripod, then having his actors stand about 30 feet away and act out a scene without moving the camera when someone steps out of the shot. I guess it gives a fly-on-the-wall feel to our view of the film, but it also kept me emotionally detached from the actors. However, the real dilemma is that 3-hour length. There wasn't enough plot to fill that quantity of time, even though they were trying to tell at least three different stories at once. It's 30 minutes of good content thinly spread over 3 hours of film. I will admit there were snippets that worked for me. I particularly liked when they overlaid the father talking about the memory of his first love with images of his daughter going through the same thing. Also anything the young boy did, while a little deep and philosophical for his age, was fun to watch. I just don't think I could ever ask another human being to sit through this film. Yi Yi, while critically acclaimed, won't draw in the average movie-goer like me.",

It brought \"A Separation\" from Asghar Farhadi back to my memory, another movie which also depicts the everyday hurdles of a family and with reminiscent aesthetics although not as fleshed out and subtle... I felt that movie was trying to achieve something similar but in much lesser scale, and yet it failed to exert in me a positive impression like the charming \"Yi Yi\". The thing that lacked in the iranian movie was present in the taiwanese in just the right doses to add that touch of nuance so necessary for the authenticity of human relations: affection/tenderness between people of different genders. You'd think this is a ridiculously basic thing to bi**h about, anyway to me any serious familiar drama must be able to depict the fundamental reason why families are formed: love between different gender people (assuming we're talking about hetero relationships, of course). This can be shown in all sorts of subtle ways, but it was almost non-existent in \"A Separation\", and at times women seemed to have a sort of manly manner to their way of being... very very weird and of putting to me. This, among other things, very much limited the power of persuasion and the ability to touch me of the iranian work, I didn't connect, it felt flat and boring. I guess the fact that it was a familiar drama filmed almost as a sort of thriller didn't help, there's nothing thrilling in familiar quotidian life, it's mostly emotional, an aspect where it felt short for me. All this just to say that contrary to \"A Separation\", \"Yi Yi\" is pretty much a perfect family drama, but pointing out this mere evidence (in my eyes) is an insult to the taiwanese work, it's much! more than that. I see \"Yi Yi\" as a bigger, better, easier to live through, a truly satisfying cinematic experience.\n\n\"Yi Yi\" is an epic drama story, the focus of attention are the life probations of a family where kids, adults and an old lady are all main characters of life and they go through many eye opening experiences that touch us, amuse us, humiliate us, intrigue us, makes us think... life lessons. It lasts for 3 hours and although this amount of time actually seems small for the thematic ambition of this work, Edward Yang manages to develop each theme, human relation, challenge with sensibility and intelligence, in a calm and confident pace and leave nothing left to say. There's indeed no need to say anything more, the premiss is fully fulfilled, by the time the movie ends we are left with the feeling of having watched something as epic, deep and bittersweet as life itself with an extra alluring spell carved by the wonderful cinematic mastery of Yang. The only thing I'd wish to be changed is the soundtrack, it's a bit too trivial, it almost cheapens the experience for me, but maybe I'm being excessively critical here, probably just a matter of taste. Fortunately it lasts little time and it's easy to forget... That's the only complain, all other technical aspects are more than good enough, the acting is excellent all around. What a wonderful movie, I highly recommend it!",

The three-hour piece starts with a wedding, concludes with a funeral, and contemplates areas of human life in between. The father, NJ, is unsatisfied with his work and the desire of his business partners to enter into a deal with a well-known Japanese videogame company. While his partners are only concerned about making money, NJ finds that his honest nature is unappreciated in the commercial realm. To his surprise, he finds a connection with the Japanese software mogul, Ota. A former old flame, Sherry, tries to walk into his life after a chance reunion. His youngest son has troubles at school with his teachers, while his daughter has to handle a love triangle involving her next door friend and her troubled boyfriend. All three try to deal with their problems while also caring for NJ's aged mother-in-law, who is in a coma, and in the absence of NJ's wife, who has left for a Buddhist retreat after facing a midlife crisis. In addition, Ah-Di, NJ's overweight brother-in-law who marries a starlet at the start of the film, has to wrestle with his demanding wife and a former love, complicating matters within this extended family.\nThe other Taiwanese cast members include Elaine Jin as NJ's wife, Min-Min, Su-Yun Ko as NJ's former love Sherry, Hsi-Sheng Chen as Ah-Di, and Pang Chang Yu as Fatty. The film also stars Japanese comedian Issei Ogata as a Japanese software mogul, Ota.",

            "content": "Edward Yang can combine a poet's eye for metaphor and imagery with a novelist's sense of detail and character. Yi Yi is a domestic drama that has the sweep of an epic and the fine acuity of a haiku. Yang's story unfolds effortlessly, populated with disquieting coincidences and sudden reversals, capturing the ebb and flow of real life. What Yang shows us in his latest film is what his many characters don't seem able to see for themselves: that despite their connections to each other, by blood or acquaintance, their isolation remains profound. (The Chinese title, literally translated, is \"One-one,\" meaning \"individually.\") Part of the thrill of watching Yi Yi's brisk three hours--which include a wedding, a birth, an attempted suicide, a murder, and a funeral--comes in discovering how the members of this extended family fit together. Discovering how they don't is what gives the film its tragic dimension. Unspooling intertwined strands of a single yarn, Yang allows us to observe, for example, that the father and daughter are both in the throes of first love, but because they never inquire into the details of each other's lives, that revelation is left to each of us alone. In the final scene, one character's deeply felt confession would seem a measure of progress for the film's dysfunctional family; unfortunately, it comes too late for the intended listener to hear.\nOne of the defining visual elements of Yi yi is its reduced palette; not in some overarching way where only five colors are used in the entire movie or anything like that, but in a scene-by-scene and even shot-by-shot way. Basically, each scene in the film is reduced to three or four colors, with reds and yellows much predominating. The important thing, however, is not which colors overwhelm the film but which colors are used in tiny ways that draw the maximum attention to themselves. The color scheme is used, in other words, to emphasize the locations in the film and the humans in the film, particularly in how those two elements do not combine smoothly.\nIn its most reduced form, the story of Yi Yi is about how idealism - particularly idealised memories and idealised concepts of how the world should fit together - don't necessarily fit in a world full of well-meaning but messy human actions. The use of color is a major component of how that theme is explored. Most of the film is bathed in soft yellowness, I mentioned, and that calls to mind vintage photographs, an old album where only nice things are recorded and families always seem to be untroubled and happy. The reality is never that simple, of course, and the film is a study of how one family learns that being human is a bit messier than lovely snapshots and nostalgic glow.",

It tells the story of this group of people simply living their lives. Through their lives the audience is able to grasp introspective themes and emotions in a very personal way. It relates the story of these people to us by putting them in situations we all can relate to.\n\n   The film blends these different themes and plot lines seamlessly and the editing stands out as a masterful aspect of the film. It makes this 3 hour drama interesting, when it could've been the complete opposite. There are a multitude of themes running throughout the film and they are all excellently developed and easily understood. It seems the main theme is trying to convey is how we live each day of our lives, and if each day is a new day we shouldn't be afraid to make a change, to break out of our routines, and experience life. The coma which the grandmother falls into catapults this perspective into action and we are able to witness how it changes these people's lives for the better and for the worse. It then assures us that it's necessary to take the good with the bad, and that is what will cause growth in us.\n\n   The film had excellent acting to present these themes and an excellent screenplay to guide the actors. The cinematography is outstanding and gives us scenes which really are a joy to watch. I really enjoyed it even though it was slow moving at times. It also had aspects of the plot I wish it would've developed more thoroughly because they interested me more than the ones which were excessively developed. It had an absolutely beautiful ending.",

            "content": "The film Yi Yi takes a unique stance on the meaning of life by focusing on the life events of the Jian family. The father NJ, is a businessman who is trying desperately to think of a plan to keep the company he belongs to a float. During the wedding of his brother in law, NJ encounters his first love Sherry. Conflict arises when the grandmother slips into a coma. This causes NJ's wife Min-Min to question her role in the family. NJ and Min- Min's five year old son Yang-Yang is the most distant member of the family. He has to deal with a chaotic teacher and a bunch of really irritating girls, which at times provide elements of much needed comedy relief. The subplot of NJ and Min-Min's teenage daughter Ting-Ting, who has to deal with the new romantic feelings for a local boy is rather boring and should have been cut out of the film, as it is an unnecessary and takes away focus from other characters. \nI do recognise that Edward Yang was trying to break the conventional traditional of the narrative and for that I have no objection. However the messy structure he adopted hampered each individual character's story by changing character focus too many times and in some case not coming back to a character for over 45 minutes e.g. the grandmother in a coma.\nThe scenes that stands out the most for me is where NJ talks with Otta about life and business, especially the scene near the end of the film where Otta uses a deck of cards to explain about life. I would have appreciated the film more if they had focused more on the father (NJ) and son (Yang-Yang). The biggest gripe I have with this film is its length. As mentioned before the film has too many subplots and is why the film goes for 3 hours, too long; The trimming of certain scenes where there is no action or story progression happening e.g. Ting-Ting and another girl in a hallway just staring at each other. These editing alterations would not take away from the story's message of life, but enrich it. \n\nI enjoyed most of the cinematography of the film. Edward Yang successfully captured the characters movement and their disconnection to their surrounding environment by the use of wide shots. He was able to us the mis en scene of the metropolis such as the city skyline in combination with reflective glass; and traffic to represent the isolation and distant thinking of the characters. I did find that some of the wide shots used, such as the cafe scene were uncomfortable, as they made me feel distant from the characters discussion. Although it did make me want to be drawn in to the discussion which I guess was one of the goals of Edward Yang.",
