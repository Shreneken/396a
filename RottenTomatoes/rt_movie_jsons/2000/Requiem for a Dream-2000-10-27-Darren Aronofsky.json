The plump Sara, galvanized by the prospect of appearing on a TV game show, has started on a dangerous diet regimen to beautify herself for a national audience.",

Sara Goldfarb's (Ellen Burstyn) universe exists primarily within her Brooklyn apartment where, fueled by amphetamines, she obsesses about appearing on television.  Meanwhile, her son Harry (Jared Leto), accompanied by his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend (Marlon Wayans), spend their days looking to score their next fix of heroin.  It is a nightmarish vision from the start as the characters slowly but inevitably descend into a world of horrifying physical and mental pain, psychosis, surreal hallucinations, and the reality that there is no escape.  While Aronofsky's outlandish style is sometimes unnecessarily distracting, the movie is buoyed by some stark and memorable imagery, a remarkable score by Aronofsky regular Clint Mansell, and what could just be Burstyn's career-defining performance.",

These four people end up in a worse and darker place by the time everything is said and done. This film takes us to a journey where we can see the addicts going from less to more, going to extreme extents to get their merchandise, and at the same time we are witnesses of their descent to insanity. \nAnother thing I want to point out is the photography. OUTSTANDING. The way this movie uses it's cameras is astonishing. Yet again, simple but incredibly effective shots result from this work of art. This movie will raise your tension and feel the desperation from the characters. It will amaze you with its beautiful scenes and unique atmosphere.\nIt is simple. It is intense. It is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, without a doubt.",

This is where Requiem For A Dream shines, the use of the camera to tell the simplest of stories, one of vice, and pain and fear, and love and joy which barely slipped through our fingers.  Before the main characters have yet to live they are seeking death.  Their parents, and their parents parents doing the same, except not through existential foes, but actual others, looking to submit to existence with slow death.  Not by drugs, but by war, or the misery of the knowledge of what one could have been.  Don't could have been is the story of this movie, summarized by lifes transposed onto drugs and violence.

I love the style in which it is filmed, there are lots of split-screen technique, exaggerated sound effects and huge close ups, and all these manage to be stylishly used. The music is stunning too, Aronofsky directs superbly and the script is brutal and very honest. Requiem for a Dream has one underlying theme, the creeping menace of addiction, this theme is explored in a lot of forms and with chilling and compelling effect. Not only that, the highs and lows of drug-taking are conveyed. The story is hard-hitting, moving and draws you in and the characters feel real. The acting helps with this, Ellen Burstyn is amazing and gives one of the best performances of the decade. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are also excellent, and Marlon Wayans I think hasn't been better. In conclusion, a powerful film, while not all people may like it it is for me one of the most important films on this subject. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The interpretations of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are remarkable and, in particular, that of Burstyn, who manages to completely fit into her character. The film also features the extensive use of short cuts, split scenes, and very tight close-ups. Finally, the movie soundtrack composed by Clint Mansell, and which includes the famous track Lux Aeterna, is simply extraordinary and is a fundamental component of the film. One of the best movies about drug addiction.",

While it's supposed to be an emotional and psychological thriller, it didn't necessarily bring out those feelings in me. I felt bad for the characters and their decision making skills but the progression of the story moved too quickly at times for me to build strong connections with those involved. However, the performances are tragically beautiful and the story is tragically bleak. The portrayal of drugs and its effect on the lives of its users and others around them is the central point and in that sense the film succeeds. Nonetheless, this film will hit harder to those who've been affected by the subject matter or have knowledge on the topic.",

            "content": "\"Requiem for a Dream\" is an American psychological drama film directed by Darren Aronofsky in 2000. It is adapted from Hubert Selby Jr. in 1978. The film describes four characters affected by drug addiction and how it changes their physical and emotional states. Their addiction makes them imprisoned in a world of fantasy and despair. As the movie develops, each character will deteriorate and their reality will be replaced by fantasy, leading to disaster.\n\"Requiem for a Dream\" is a movie of four Americans who have fallen from power. They have no bright future but resort to stimulants. When Sara hoped to find a way out of chemical happiness, for her son Harry, his girlfriend Marian and friend Tyrone, she also got used too the pills and even mother Sara Goldfarb fell into a downward spiral. At the beginning of the film, she still tried to guide the child on the right path by tying the TV he wanted to sell to the radiator, but when a rogue nutritionist confessed to a somewhat neurotic sixty-year-old that she might lose weight, because of the pills she didn't want to stop taking them and got addicted.\nThe movie focuses on the lives of the residents of Coney Island, and the film shows the consequences of addiction and obsession and how obsession leads to addiction. By playing with different camera angles and the smooth editing work, a special film experience is created. Just like the audience has experienced the pain of various characters. \nJared Leto convincingly plays the role of drug addict Harry Goldfarb, and he will do his best to get the last batch of heroin. But money is a problem. He has no choice but to force his addict girlfriend Marion into prostitution, and the latter is a brilliant role played by Jennifer Connelly. His good friend Tyrone, played by Marlon Wayans, also tried to control his addiction, but his efforts were in vain.\nWhen friends were struggling with addiction, Harry's mother Sara was glued to the tube when she called for contestants on her favorite TV show. She is determined to participate, but needs to lose a few pounds to wear her favorite clothes. Her obsession with television made her addicted to drugs that can speed up the weight loss process. But the result was disastrous, and Sara slowly and surely seemed to lose control of reality. The exorcist actress Ellen Burstyn played a very good role.\n\"Requiem for a Dream'' is a drama film that makes you think, but also gives you a bad feeling. The film clearly shows how strong an addiction can be. But also how strong an obsession can be and that this can lead to rash choices with disastrous consequences. Requiem for a Dream is, for me, the example of a good film that I never need to see again. It made me quite depressed. With this masterpiece, he impressed me as a viewer.",

The acting is phenomenal. The editing, cinematography, and filming style is just amazing and innovative. The way he brings to life four different character arcs such that we care about each and everyone of them shows an artist who is a master at his craft.\n\nFor some reason I didn't have the passionate reaction to this as the many fans/critics that absolutely adore the movie. This may be a generational issue.\n\nTrainspotting was more to my personal liking which I think has to do with the soundtrack which for me really elevated it to a more re-watchable film. Trainspotting may have more comedy, but it can get super dark as well (the baby scene).\n\nUltimately, this is clearly a movie classic that will stand the test of time.",

Might not be everyone's taste but it's a creative example of a filmmakers vision. The 1978 novel was grimly forensic in detailing the physical and mental destruction wrought by drug addiction. \nThe movie also has one of the most memorable scores ever. Wonderful performances and such bleak imagery are impressive. Good cutting edge indie filmmaking with its split screen style and extreme closeups. \nIt says we're all vulnerable to some manner of addiction, and legal ones aren't necessarily safer or less ruinous than their underworld counterparts.\nThe movie vividly evokes the sensation of what drugs actually do to your system, briefly for better and mostly for worse, from twitchy initial rush through to comedown and tortured aftermath.

Every cast member does a strong turn, but she is the unparalleled standout, accompanied by a major surprise in the form of an unexpectedly good performance from Wayans (who I was unaware had performed in any serious dramas at all). The film's notorious intensity was definitely a driving factor preventing me from seeing this film at some point in the previous two decades, but now having seen it I would describe the film more as exceptionally uncomfortable than unpalatable, gradually building up pressure before ultimately allowing the pot to boil over (characteristic of Aronofsky). The film's take on psychological surrealism and induced delusion is great; parents, don't rely on McGruff the Crime Dog to tell your kids not to do drugs, just show them Requiem for a Dream. (4/5)",

            "content": "Requiem for a dream is written and directed by Darren Aronofsky based on the book with the same name written by Hurbert Shelby Jr. This film is the story about 4 individual lives and their addictions. One of them played by Ellen Burstyn gets addicted to diet pills when she is invited on a game show and must slim down in order to fit into a dress she so desperately wants to wear and also to look good. Her son played by Jared Leto who is addicted to a lot of things mainly heroine starts up a business with his girlfriend played by Jennifer Connelly and his best friend played by Marlon Wayans where they get drugs and sell it to make profit. And as the year for each individual drug induced person goes on things start getting worse and worse as the drugs take over their health and life. \n\nRequiem for a Dream is one of those films that will never escape me and for whoever watches the film I guarantee that it won't leave the mind as well. Through this entire runtime my eyes were glued to the screen for beginning, middle and end. Once in a while I'd think to myself man I am really invested in this film. This film garners your attention and never lets up. Which is an aspect that I think people might not like but we'll get to that in a little bit. From the incredible pacing I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and never found myself attention-less. Requiem for a Dream is an phenomenal piece of cinema that will go down in film history as possibly one if not the nightmarish and disturbing films ever created. And it is by far one of the best films that I have ever seen. Now that might seem very daunting because of the subject matter of the film but I don't know. Not thinking about that subject matter there's something very intriguing about this film that I can't not stop thinking about. \n\nDarren Aronofsky has crafted such a unique and creative tale of misery and sadness that in a way just seems so perfect. The way the story is told and how the editing plays a major part of the film from editor Jay Rabinowitz. Including the shots and cinematography from director Darren Aronofsky and cinematography Matthew Libatique giving the atmosphere of the film its claustrophobic and disturbing experience. From the nightmarish scenes involving their hallucinations to the drugs they take to moments of consequences they have to endear. Also trying not to forget to mention but the fantastic and nerve racking score from Clint Mansell giving the film another bump of adrenaline and absolute menace. This might be my favorite Darren Aronofsky film ever and to be far I haven't seen all of his films yet but man I don't think with an experience like this one will be beaten by any of his other films to tell the truth. He did an amazing job at directing this including writing this. It's very unpredictable there was even a moment in the film after I was halfway through it that I decided I can't predict anything out of this film which is something that I really enjoy from a film. You also get why they do this, they're not just stereotypical junkies, they have motives and reasons why they do the drugs. \n\nWhich leave me to the performances from our 4 main characters. Right off the bat I'm debating if I like Jared Leto more in this or in Dallas Buyers Club. He was terrific in this film. Jennifer Connelly is an actress I'd like to watch more of because man she was also fantastic in this film as the girlfriend of Jared Leto's character. Marlon Wayans as Jared Leto's best friend was also really great in the film which I didn't expect at all but he did really well. But my favorite performance throughout this film was Ellen Burstyn. Out of all of them I felt more for her than anyone. But not to say that I didn't really feel bad for anyone else, I most certainly felt bad for everyone but Ellen's performance I felt just more sympathetic for. From the beginning and end you can see the drastic change in her after going to far with the drugs she takes which was just heart breaking. There's also one scene where I just thought this is by far one of the best actress acting scenes I have ever seen ever. She was freaking phenomenal in this film. Now for all of them just mentioning it briefly but there is one sequence that had my mouth in ah and could not look away. A sequence that made me realize what an uplifting experience this entire film has been. \n\nComing back to what I mentioned before this film will tear you to pieces with its editing, storytelling and subject matter. Also it's aspect of claustrophobia. And I will be fully understandable if this subject matter is something you or anyone else can't handle. I would never recommend watching this film ever if you feel that way about the subject matter. Trying not to be super dramatic but it's the truth. Darren Aronofsky understands the subject matter and throws his own unique spin on it giving it a very disturbing and very sad experience and is also a film and has also been deemed a film that no one should watch on a second viewing and it's the absolute truth. This is no blockbuster you can watch over and over again and be entertained by, this is a grounded dark tale that will already never leave your mind because of how it is. All in all if you can handle this subject matter I'd watch it for the experience and be done with it.  Or if you're like me you might really like it but who knows. And another thing worth noting is this film is not trying to promote addiction. This is a film that a wanna be junkie will watch and probably will never want to do drugs ever. That's how terrifying this film is. \n\nRequiem for a Dream is one of the best and one if not the most disturbing and upsetting film I have ever seen in my life and I gonna give it a 10/10. \nThank you so much for reading look forward to more reviews very soon.",

Even though the characters lost their will to live and must suffer the rest of their respective lives as consequences for their horrible, pathetically disgusting addictions, the cast performed well in getting through especially the young trio building up their stardom at the time. Only one communication found common sense through Leto's performance in one scene with words his character should have listened to and additionally become a hypocritical drug addict, which is a brutalized truth that people using drugs are arrogantly ignorant of the dangers posed against their well-beings ‚Äì and that shows how Aronofsky should've gone further in communication rather than focusing on the depressing spiral. Fairly praiseworthy on the aesthetics through the cinematography and acceptable surrealism despite the discomfort, but how can it be rated into the like if it's not enjoyable? If you ever watch this film, whether nighttime or not, immediately follow it with a more positive film, doesn't matter if it's a good one or a bad one, just to get rid of what your eyes just tasted.

I've never been a fan of camera shots where the character's face is up close to the camera while they're walking.  All it does is induce nausea.  There's no real point to the movie other than characters who are addicted to drugs have bad things happen to them as their worlds crumble down more and more until the movie ends.  It's a series of events within these characters lives that we're watching unfold, but the characters don't have any real goals they're working towards.  Any obstacles they face are induced by themselves due to their poor decision making which I guess is the point.  Character development isn't a part of this since these characters start out lousy and end up lousier.  I'd put this on the same level as Trainspotting: interesting, bizarre, bleak, but ultimately not very sobering with little to no rewatch value.",

If you are currently an addict, it might just help you make the decision to get some help, or if you're strong enough, to quit on your own.  As many reviews warn, the imagery is graphic.

But, dear God, is it going to be a massive buzzkill to whatever the hell you had going on in your life. As a visual experience, it is simply exhausting, but it's not all for naught. Many critics cite Aronofsky's provocative filmmaking style to be a bit excessive, if not obvious or lacking in finesse. And though I might find this critique to be true in some cases (i.e. \"mother!\"), I think \"Requiem For A Dream\" might be that rare case where I couldn't see any other approach doing the story justice. This is a movie that hits that \"best of both worlds\" zone of provocateur filmmaking, where the product ultimately ends up being unnerving and difficult, yes, but also thought-provoking and called for. \n\nDo I ever want to see it again? Not really, no. But, man, did Ellen Burstyn ever deliver a career-defining performance, if I ever saw one.",

There isn't much about this one to not like. The writing is great, the story is great, and the characters are all very interesting on their own. Oddly, the only thing I had a bit of an issue with was the cinematography. I just wasn't much of a fan of how it was all shot and the overall look of the film, but that's more of a nitpick than anything.
