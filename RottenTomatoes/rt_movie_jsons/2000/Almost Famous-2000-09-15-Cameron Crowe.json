Patrick Fugit is decent for the most part but he doesn't pull off the emotional moments well enough, the rest of the cast is excellent.

However, the movie is not so much about the music as it is about adolescence and the pursuit of an adventure. The intention seems to be to demonstrate the importance of a push and pull between mentorship, orderly rules, and chaos in character development thereby providing a familiar but nonetheless interesting interpretation of what it means to grow up and become an \"interesting\" person. Very similar feeling to The Girls Next Door and Risky Business.",

The movie takes a look at a brighter than average American boy who comes of age in the era of the 60's and 70's.  Patrick Fugit is great as Crowe.   The cast, including Philip Seymour Hoffman, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, Frances McDormand and so many more is really good.  It is a great look at the coming of age of America at this time as well as Rock N Roll.  The script, Direction, and cinematography is well done.  of course, the music is a terrific accompaniment for this one.   Very funny footnote- the opening segment of Marc Maron's WTF Podcast comes from his role in this movie.",

It was a time in my life that I think was truly the best of times--that sweet spot between the hippies of the 60's and before disco reared it's ugly head. So many great bands and artists from that time in my life that made it both the best of times and the worst of times. While I hadn't wanted to be a \"Band-Aid\" I listened to music studiously and my friends and I would sit in the family room of some kid's house, listening to Zepplin or The Doobie Brothers, debated about the lyrics-what inspired them or what they were really trying to say between the lines. We would wax poetic about who was the best guitarist or drummer while sneaking beer, smoking Marlboros (or other things). Almost Famous captures that time perfectly. Whenever I find myself needing to walk down memory lane, that's the movie I want to watch because it takes me there. I'm back sitting in a dingy room in a bean bag chair on some really ugly orange shag carpet-and I'm a teenager again.",

The soundtrack is amazing, show the pure roots of rock. Anyway, It's 70's, isn't it? The script is good. There isn't too much going on in the background, like a complete love story, but, anyway, I guess the idea of the script was really to depict a guy who just wanted to live his dream of accompany a big rock band that he was a big fan of, and his discoveries as an adolescent. I see people commenting that they were expecting a big story behind the movie, but it's simplicity is what made me love it the most. It's a reality of a band, the day by day, the backstage, a simple love story behind it as a background, and good music. And that is what rock is about, the feelings, the simplicity. Couldn't be better. Long live to rock and roll!",

            "content": "Cameron Crowe's \"Almost Famous\" is an ambitious, nostalgic and sprawling coming-of-age drama suggesting filmmakers deserve recounting their famous stories without vanity. With biographical drama, Crowe drew from his childhood memories to crafting a nostalgia portrait of rock-and-roll era defined by timeless aurra. Using spellbinding cinematography, Crowe draws viewers into an adolescent's almost famous journey of self-discovery in Rock-and-Roll music industry. Emulating Bradley Cooper's \"A Star is Born\", Crowe effectively uses lens flare lighting to foreshadow doomed fate awaiting a rock band unaware of being spyed on by journalists. Crowe showcases extraordinary control over production design, editing and music, creating euphoric cinematic experience. Crowe's script is also sensational, expertly employing voice-over narration to immerse viewers into a teenage journalists' mindset. It's hard to not appreciate astonishing performances. Patrick Fugit delivers career-defining child performance as Will. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys angst, desperation and regrets of teen hit the jackpot with opportunity to interview his favorite rock-stars. Kate Hudson is equally excellent in the role of a seductive rock-star that takes impressionable youth under her wing. In one of her finest roles, Hudson imbues sympathy into a heiress. Lastly, Billy Crudup  merits recognition. As aging rockstar, he brings immense swagger to the movie. Although \"Almost Famous'\" undeniably unforgettable period piece, ultimately it isn't flawless. At nearly three hours, it suffers from lengthy running-time testing viewer's patience. Moreover, it unintentionally glamorizes drug lifestyle encouraging youth to engage in substance abuse without showing its consequences. Nevertheless, fans of biopics will definitely enjoy \"Almost Famous\" and so will movie-goers looking for enlightening entertainment. Nearly 20 years after it shot to Almost Famous fame in Hollywood, it remains a prime example of the therapeutic value in tracing Boyhood memories across centuries studied by Breakfast Club societies despite teenagers on the Edge of Seventeen arguing that filmmaking is a strictly business rather than personal profession scarcely lending itself towards capturing Dazed and Confused uncertainty faced by Boy in Striped Pajamas confined in concentration camps ruled by police reminding inmates Life is Beautiful only for Nazis that aren't Scarfaced by refugees.",

            "content": "The film Almost Famous, directed by Cameron Crowe, does a fascinating job at depicting and illustrating the innocence and excitement that main character William Miller experiences as he dives into the real world of onset \"Rock and Roll.\" With this, Miller begins to understand the drama, beauty and love that comes with being a part of a famous band and sharing what you understand to love and what others praise the band for; their music. The film's soundtrack is the main theme that I would like to praise and bring to attention, and is the main reason why this film is so able to accurately portray and depict these scenes into real life emotions and make viewers like myself feel so connected to each and every clip. One scene that really grabbed my attention and helped put into play how this Films uses its music to illustrate and illuminate the emotion in every clip was Penny's overdose in the hotel room, with the song \"My Cherie Amour\" by Stevie Wonder playing over the scene. In this scene, William Miller has already announced his love for Penny as he holds her limp body up as she is severely intoxicated; She falls to the ground from all the drugs in her system, and as a precaution and fear of overdosing, William has already called the hotel paramedics to get a doctor for Penny. The doctors barge in as she falls, and help her to the sink area so they can blow up her stomach and induce vomit. This is when My Cherie Amour begins to play, which is a rather sweet and beautiful song. Dramatic irony is shown in this scene as generally a director would choose a more sad and dramatic song for a scene with someone throwing up and overdosing. But Crowes choice of music gives you chills as you watch Penny suffer and throw up, but at the same time look so beautiful as her legs and feet begin to curl up and her clothing falls off and her skin becomes more exposed; and at the end of the song and scene, the cameras go back to William who is smiling lightly and is showing emotions of true love, whilst staring at Penny and her beauty. William is so in love blinded by her beauty that even in a situation of death, all he can focus on is her. Without the director's choice of this beautiful upbeat love song, viewers would not have been able to grasp any of this disposition or chemical romance that is displayed in this scene, and it would've been depicted as a more tragic and sad scene, rather than one filled with bliss and romance, which is what the director intended to do. Each and every scene in this movie is followed by an amazing song that is specifically picked to help illustrate what emotion viewers are supposed to be grabbing from each scene, which truly makes this film such a masterpiece.",

While there is serious attention paid to the pitfalls of fame and success, the glare of the media, and balancing journalistic and personal relationships there's also plenty of screen time dedicated to teenage love and angst. At certain times it feels that the examination of the former is lacking because of the latter. Really, at the end of the day this is more a vehicle for a coming of age story rather than a story about the music. Yet the film would be lesser with one and not the other, or else it would become an entirely different creature to say the least. The band on the run plot trods well into familiar territory and spins the same wheels that other films such as Spinal Tap have done better.",

It is a complex and heartfelt Dramedy, complete with some very funny moments, some really hard-hitting emotional beats, and one of the most satisfying endings of any movie I can think of.  Each character is expertly performed and wonderfully written, and honestly if I discovered there was a 3 hour extended cut of this movie, I would gladly sit down to watch it.  The movie centers around William Miller, someone who any aspiring writer/philosopher/visionary can relate to, as he is a social outcast, has no luck with girls and struggles with the fact that nobody will take him seriously, even if they like him.  His tale is mostly about him going on the road with one of his favorite bands after they invite him with them after he approaches them for an Interview for Rolling Stone, and he is witness to the triumphs, the chaos, and most compelling, the immensely complicated group psychology of the band he is travelling with, and every one of these facets work to almost perfection.  Basically, imagine everything you can do right with a Road movie, combine it with a Rock and Roll movie, and top that off with a very effective and powerful Bittersweet Love Story, and you have Almost Famous.  I'm generally not one to ever say that you should judge a person on their opinion of a movie you love or hate, but this is such a tender and thoughtful film that if you know someone who has seen it and genuinely hated it, then there's a solid chance they just might be a bad person.",

Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical tale of a fledgling teenage music journalist's immersion in the world of rock anthems, groupies, and shifting band dynamics delivers rock's exalting highs and humbling lows in a way that lovingly honors the decadence and immersive mythology our biggest guitar-driven bands once manifested.\n\nGroupies, band ethos, and a carefully curated soundtrack sold this film, and it's those same reverent depictions that have earned \"Almost Famous\" its own wing in the Pantheon of all-time music films. - (WATCHED THIS?

            "content": "Where did Cameron Crowe's career go? He produced several classic films in the late 1980s and 1990s but with the release of middling We Bought a Zoo (2011) and the awful Elizabethtown (2005) he appears to be on a downward trajectory. It is nice to remember what made him such an acclaimed filmmaker as he does represent the coming of age of sensitive young men with sweetness and specificity and captures the look and feel of the 1970s expertly. The film is funny without betraying the pains that the characters in the film experience and the struggle of becoming a man in an era that allowed for such great freedom.\n\nTeenage prodigy William Miller, Patrick Fugit, grows up in the 1970s as a music lover restricted by his conservative mother Elaine, Frances McDormand, and suburban life. He escapes from this world by writing articles for publications that cover music and is eventually hired by Ben Fong-Torres to cover the ascendant band Stillwater while they are on tour. He befriends groupie Penny Lane, Kate Hudson, who is having an affair with the band's lead guitarist Russell Hammond, Billy Crudup. Miller attempts to cover the band objectively but realizes that their actions may be immoral as Hammond treats Lane poorly and tensions erupt within the band over who is acknowledged as the lead singer. He ends up writing a highly critical article about the band which is well received by his employers but refuted by an angered Hammond. He returns home after this event and ruminates on his time with the band and his experiences with Lane who has stopped being a groupie in the face of Hammond's mistreatment. Lane facilitates a reconciliation between Miller and Hammond that allows for the article to be published and for both men to continue pursuing their career ambitions.\n\nThe character of Penny Lane has become famous as she is allegedly based on notable real life figures such as Bebe Buell but this is probably because the film is able to tap into the deep insecurity and sadness that comes with being used for sex. She angrily protests that she is a \"Band Aid\" and is there for the music and not simply to sleep with famous men but this is clearly not how Hammond, already in a serious relationship, views her. She tries her hardest to keep up the fa\u00e7ade of a breezy, happy girl willing to go along with anything but when she is carelessly gambled away by the man she has come to love she cannot keep it together anymore. We see her through the eyes of a young man who adores her because she is beautiful and seems like such a free spirit but even he begins to notice that she is vulnerable and her relationship with Hammond is toxic. At the end of the film we know that Miller now understands that women are more than just their physical appearances and feel things just as deeply as men even if they appear to have not a care in the world.\n\nThe film also has a beautiful rhythm to it as it moves slowly and without urgency as Miller absorbs the environment around him and the romantic side of the music world during this time period is explored. We will stop briefly for the band and all of their entourage to sing Elton John's \"Tiny Dancer\" together or for Lane to perform an impromptu dance. There would not be room for these moments in a different film but Crowe gets the relaxed attitude that most of this strange crew of people would have had during this tour and the culture that allowed for some of the worst actions that the band took. Crowe is willing to spend time with these characters when they are not at the high points of drama and are simply going through the motions of everyday life and that is what makes him so special as a writer-director.\n\nYou also feel as though Crowe really does identify with his main character, this is a semi-autobiographical film, so even when he makes mistakes or miscalculates situations he is sympathetic and this means that the film is more lovable than some of the more cynical deconstructions of rock bands from this era.",

Crowe's fourth feature represents another unqualified success for the director, who has yet to have a bad outing. The movie has a great classic rock soundtrack (including some new songs by Peter Frampton) and strong production values that enhance the illusion that Crowe has turned back the clock by a quarter of a century. Almost Famous takes things to the next level, allowing us to believe that the motion picture is transpiring during the era when it is supposed to be taking place.",

As much as unique the concept is, it equally is simple and sensible that breeds valuable opinions from each three dimensional characters of it. \n\nCrowe's world in here believes to live in present and enjoy each tiny moments which offers the audience an adequate soothing closure in each frame; it's just a \"good\" story is what it is. Even the weaving of the structure that occurs in front of the audience in its initial stages, is breathtaking with monologues, debates and \"teenage fun\" bits that makes it slick. \n\nThe songs are uplifting, the backyard score is decently scored, the cinematography is mesmerizing with fine editing and stunning camera work and visuals with live locations that foliates it into the anticipated musical cinematic experience. Hudson is surprisingly good with Crudup and Lane going head to head offering the appropriate crisp to their track and McDormand as always offering the gravitas and keeps this fairy tale grounded. \n\nCrowe's narration is far better than we usually get in such band musicals and the primary reason to that is that it is perfectly balanced, it never is too light nor dark, he is well aware of his audience and he can filter them out with maturity itself. His execution is definitely worth the script he wrote, in fact if anything it celebrates it with an extravaganza for life where each emotional conflict is respected equally with a subtle tone. The behind the stage preparations and conversations that a star goes through, the originality and innocence of the concept and Crowe oozing his presence behind all of it are the high points of the feature. \n\nAlmost Famous is pure art that both lyrically rhymes and taps to the beat and eventually make you too.",

            "content": "First things first, I accidentally watched the Director's Cut of the film which is 162 minutes long (40 minutes longer than the released film, which I haven't seen).  I'm not certain whether the extra time benefits the film or reduces its quality.  There were a few places where things felt long or indulgent.  But, of course, the whole premise is pretty indulgent - this is the story of Cameron Crowe's experience as a teen journalist for Rolling Stone touring with The Allman Brothers (here replaced by a fictional band, Stillwater, starring Billy Crudup and Jason Lee).  Crowe wrote and directed the film and gives himself a pretty glorified part.  Moreover, taking place in the early 1970s, the action onscreen is also indulgent, in that there is lots of drinking and drug use (although this is mostly implied because the film seems somehow to be aiming for family friendly, despite the debauchery).  Which brings me to the question of whether this film feels \"right\" in the era of #MeToo.  In fact, it doesn't.  Kate Hudson is the groupie with the heart of gold and, although the film acknowledges that she is treated badly by the band, it doesn't really make any effort to condemn that treatment, at least not strenuously.  Instead, it is nostalgic good times all the way and the rockin' soundtrack doesn't hurt that sentiment one bit.  Crowe spends his time trying to depict the emotional journey of the hero (himself, played wide-eyed by Patrick Fugit) and he does manage to capture wistful naivete pretty well (a la your typical coming-of-age story), including a delayed coda that makes it all right.  A few scenes do suggest that the film could have verged into Spinal Tap territory, but it doesn't (too bad).  However, this may be the only fiction film to ever have someone play Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and that's worth the price of admission on its own.",
