It is hilarious at times, but overall the script sucks and the cgi is awful. I do however commend them on getting a huge wealth of stars to be in this film. It's really suprising. I still really enjoy this film despite how bad it is. In my opinion it's so bad it's good and definitely worth seeing at least once.",

Not too much earlier, I had watch War of the Worlds and been fairly underwhelmed by the lack of heroism in the Tom Cruise character Ray, and was a bit weary of that type of movie.  So I was ready for something different and chose The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.  I was a bit leery given the 20% audience rating, but I had liked the cartoon as a kid and decided I needed to see this movie.  Robert De Niro, Jason Alexander, and Rene Russo did a great job as the villains, and even mimicked the cartoon characters very well when they were jumping up and down in frustration.  Very good acting.  The original Rocky and Bullwinkle show I watched was a pretty low quality cartoon, but it was still funny and it pass the time on Sunday mornings before church.  This movie is similarly of a lower quality special effects-wise when compared to other movies out there, but it was still entertaining and that lack of sophistication seems to fit the movie extending the cartoon series.  I wouldn't say this movie is a continuous laugh riot like a lot of Leslie Nielson movies tend to be, but it was still fairly entertaining.  Nothing too inappropriate for younger viewers (not that I can recall anyways), and some decent plot device twists I didn't see coming.  20% seems really harsh for this movie.  It deserves a better rating.  It did make me laugh out loud a few times.  Its societal commentary was dead on.",

Better than most of the others, but it still doesn't work, even with the decision to keep Rocky and Bullwinkle as toons rather than use, say, people in animal costumes.\n\nA full-fledged cartoon version would have been far better. The human actors don't fit in with their cartoon counterparts. Robert DeNiro certainly didn't fit the part of Fearless Leader (they should have given that role to Nicholas Cage, who had a more suitable physique). We could have done without \"Nothing But A Dreamer\" by Supertramp either (the cartoon didn't have music, other than the theme and some \"dramatic effect\" chords at times) This effectively spoiled the old cartoon atmosphere, and the story itself was meandering and ultimately boring and pointless. For the running time, they could have done so much more.\n\nIntended for fans of the old cartoon, but probably won't satisfy most of them.",

It's definitely a recommendation for Rocky and Bullwinkle fans, and classic cartoon fans in general, but may have people not familiar with the show rolling their eyes. Bottom line is that it's one of those films that are \"so bad it's good.\"",

Boris, Natasha, and their Fearless Leader find a way to warp into real life.  The government decides to give the case to one of their weakest officers, who is assigned Rocky and Bullwinkle to stop the notorious villains.

The storyline for this picture actually reminded me of Rat Race with two cartoons added to the cast.  The plot was nothing special and the animation was okay.  The make-up was pretty good but the acting was below par.  The cast includes Robert De Niro, Jason Alexander, Renee Russo, Randy Quaid, Piper Perabo, John Goodman, David Alan Grier, Doug Jones, Billy Crystal, and Whoopi Goldberg.  \n\n\"You weigh 400 imaginary pounds.\"\n\"But it's all moosle.\"\n\nMy daughter and I watched this movie this morning and when I first put it on she said, \"that's daddy's movie.\"  I finally convinced her this movie was for her, and as soon as the movie started, she was hooked.

It was an all around great funny time, I liked it. 19% by audiences? Really? The critics score is surprisingly high. I liked the story and the amount of in jokes they make, it's supposed to be silly and the movie just relishes in that, 4th wall breaking galore.

Everything on the DVD complimenting it is a big lie, really, but I'm sure kids will enjoy it, the adults will be in cinematic hell.\nRocky and Bullwinkle try to make their big comeback (which ultimately failed) in this new-age spin on the old cartoon. Rocky and Bullwinkle come to life in CGI form while their villains, Fearless Leader and his henchmen Boris and Natasha, are plotting to brainwash the nation by taking over every TV channel and replacing their show with corny German sitcoms. Rocky and Bullwinkle and their insanely unlikable FBI friend Agent Sympathy try to stop them by going on a road trip to NYC.\nThis movie fails in everything it does, but I gave it a 1 1/2 rating because it may be appealing to kids, despite how bland the feel of it is. The jokes fall flat because they have that wacky feel to them, but it just doesn't work here. Rocky and Bullwinkle themselves are incredibly bland as characters. Rocky is basically the voice of reason but nothing else other than that. Bullwinkle is just a poor man's Goofy, while the villains Boris and Natasha aren't as bad as our main stars, but still are incredibly unfunny. De Niro was only in like 15 minutes of the film and seemed very uncaring towards his role. I can see why after seeing this trash. I would not suggest it even to kids, because while it says \"HIP!\" on the DVD box, it's just saying that it has 2 minute guest stars from the present age like Kenan & Kel and Billy Crystal, so now it's somehow \"hip\".

I re-saw it again recently (I was really bored), and I think I know why this was the case. It is too silly for adults to enjoy and a few too many inside jokes that go over the heads of the kids that it is made for. I know this was a big part of the TV program (which admittedly I was never a big fan of) and it has worked in other movie adaptations of the creator Jay Ward's shows, but this time it just fell flat. It is a little hard to call it a terrible movie because it has some vaguely amusing parts in it and the producers are aware of how corny the material is, but it is still definitely not a good one. If you are ten years or younger or you are a fan of the original cartoon, see it at your own risk. Otherwise, avoid it.\n\nP.S. I am writing this because I found out that today (from what I have read) is the 50th anniversary of the debut of the cartoon, and I am trying to avoid doing work. If you are offended by me writing a negative review of the movie adaptation on the jubilee of the original source, I meant no disrespect; I'm just trying to be honest...and to procrastinate.",

Watch it, regardless of how bad it is. \r\nI saw this in the theaters and felt extremely cheated of my $8. This film was just awful, so awful in fact that within the film the characters are sent to court for being so lousy. \r\nThe whole thing that gets me to watch this film, is the nostalgia, that this film represents. It's Rocky & Bullwinkle, 2 cartoon characters that were as present in my childhood as He-Man & Thundercats were. \r\nPiper Perabo helps the film a little bitm because she is so amazibgly gorgeous. She also does a decent job at portraying the outsider, she's basically put in the film as an audience member, which helps to relate within all the craziness. \r\nThe most surprising casting done in this film and probably one of the draws for today's generation are; Jason Alexander, Rene Russo and Robert De Niro as the 3 main villains. Having these great actors in this film can only help keep the films head above water. \r\nDe Niro is ridiculous in the role of Fearless Leader, but that is how the character is meant to be. \r\nAlexander and Russo help as the major comedy element in this film. Both actors have lent themselves to serious and comedy roles before and never have they been so hilarious, but not always in a good way. \r\nCameos include David Allen Grier, Joe Polito, Randy Quaid, Whoopi Goldberg, Keenan & Kel and more. \r\nGo see this film, you have nothing else to watch, lol \r\n3 out of 5 stars, just for the fact that even the film knows how bad the film is.",

With a gigantic cast such as this, you would think this film would have been big (or awesome for that matter), but no. Instead, it's very annoying and very stupid. Robert De Niro should be ashamed for re-stating his infamous monologue from Taxi Driver in a supposedly comical moment.

Maybe living in the UK and not growing up watching R&B was partly to blame but you shouldn't have had to of seen the original cartoon to find it funny. The jokes are really bad and even though many are \"supposed\" to be bad it just leaves you with an empty felling in your gut. If you want to see a better cartoon to live action film try Scooby Doo instead. My young boys said they liked it but I could tell they were completely lost at some points. I should have done the washing up instead :-(",

The plot of the film does extremely little with the subject material that it has, instead relying on a canned plot, stereotyped villains, and a lead character that's just not that fun to watch. Rocky and Bullwinkle have their zingers and moments throughout, but for some odd reason are not the focus of the film that carries their namesake. And how this film cost $70 million plus is beyond me.",

Still the concept is charming, the jokes range between hilariously satirical and as amazingly corney as the telivision show. Yes its campy but if you're a fan of the amazing 60's cartoon show, you know that is not only par for the course but its what Rocky and Bullwinkle were always about. The stars in leads and the star cameos just add an amazing icing on the cake, especially DeNiro. If you didn't enjoy this film, just a little bit, you may have never smiled in your life.",
