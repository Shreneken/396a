    "summary": "Two North Korean soldiers are killed in the border area between North and South Korea, prompting an investigation by a neutral body. Sgt. Lee Soo-hyeok (Lee Byung-hun) is the shooter, but lead investigator Maj. Sophie E. Jean (Lee Young-ae), a Swiss-Korean woman, receives differing accounts from the two sides. Lee claims he fired in self-defense after getting wounded, while a North Korean survivor says it was a premeditated attack -- leaving Jean with her work cut out for her.",

However, despite the apparent focus on the tensions between the two states, threatening to ensnare the whole world, the movie is actually a John Woo-styled look at male bonding across an insurmountable divide (political rather than legal).  Director Chan-Wook Park (whose biggest hit is the notorious Oldboy, 2004) plays with both time and truth, delivering us different versions of the pivotal event (the killing of two soldiers in the North's gatehouse by a lone Sgt from the South) in flashback based on the legal depositions of those who survived and then on both memories and confessions.  A half-Korean member of the Neutral Nations investigation team (from Switzerland) interviews all of the men involved on both sides of the border; she follows the usual rulebook but is compromised in the end.  Park's direction is always stylish and he uses a variety of camera moves to keep things interesting (such as a quick pan from character to character).  There's less action than you would think but tension is maintained until we reach the requisite five-way armed stand-off.  Apparently, Tarantino loved this film and you can see why in the plotting (but not the dialogue).  Kang-Ho Song (excellent in Joon-ho Bong's Memories of Murder, 2003) is charismatic as the North Korean Sgt but all of the four male principals are solid.",

Over the years many movies have taken inspiration from NSA. Two sequences are worth praise, the first one where three soldier meet at mine field and final one when all four are by chance in one snapshot taken by a tourist. Very strong and active screenplay and very good performances.",

It doesn't go with the historical agressions in the area, but goes somewhere fictional and ideal. In this fim we also see some nationalistic propaganda in bringing the two countries together. Hidden as a crime story, it brings out a good war drama about brotherhood and patriotism. A must watch.",

The combination of feel-good and dark tones give it the characteristic flavor from director Chan Wook Park.  The ending is also really heart-wrenching.  I can imagine the final frame made some viewers cry.  This is excellent storytelling that uses the basics and avoids the bells and whistles of intense action, effects, or even a score.",

            "content": "Before his madness in 'I'm A Cyborg' or his violent exploits in the 'Vengeance' trilogy art director Park Chan-Wook created one of his first films based around the Koreon borders. The strict 'Joint Ssecurity Area' (its proper name) has existed since the civil war. Chan-wook's outstanding visual style seems rather subdued from this picture, but given the topics seriousness all could be forgiven. The main story is told through a series of flashbacks. After a breach of military security at the northern border leaves two Koreon's dead and a third injured a south koreon stumbles back across the divide to his country. The two survivors from the sides are given false statements by their superiors in a bid to start another war. When we experience the true events of what happened Chan-wook attempts to weave some heart and soul into the stereotypical war dialogue that consists of little more than swearing. As a swiss team is set up to investigate the incident neither country will give way, and the finale is tragic and fatal. It is just a shame that some of the brilliant moments in the film are too few and the rest too conventional, but it is the thin character development which lets this down and not the premise for which it is based upon. Chan-wook is friends with Kim Ji-woon (director of A Bittersweet Life and A Tale Of Two Sisters) and they often borrow actors from each other in this case we have the main south koreon character played by Lee Byung-Hun (Bittersweet Life) being interrogated by Lee Young Ae who gave a phenomonal performance in the last of Wooks Vengeance films (Sympathy For Lady Vengeance 6th in my top 50 list). Their acting is of a great standard but the rather bland direction they are giving and the cold clinical, even ugly setting detracts from their characters. Chan-wook relies on convention too heavily here and misses out on the chance to make something much more unique and impressive which is disappointing with the talent at his fingertips. An early feature from Chan-Wook it may be but for some reason he almost loses all of his unique cinematography in this film. Apart from the odd beautiful moment (the training exercise in the forests looks spectacular) Chan-wooks quirky way of filming is often lost in the uninteresting characters. However Chan-wook is still light years away from his rivals and even he can make something so clinical interesting enough. Without a solid base for the story to revolve around the adrenaline pumped action scenes do not have the impact they should have, same as the ending. The musical score is enjoyable and some of the snide humourous interactions between the officals on both sides of the border and a joy to watch, but something seems amiss. Of the four other Chan-wook films I have seen this is arguably his worst, but the topic is full of depth and the film does repay with more than one viewing, with character problems aside this could have been a classic, it is just a shame its all too familiar and bland in place.",

            "content": "The Joint Security Area (JSA) refers to the North and South Korean border. A tense and formal area manned on both sides by armed soldiers. By day a South Korean tourist attraction manned by uniformed expressionless guards 8 feet apart, by night the sides withdraw to either side of a bridge in manned posts perhaps 100 metres apart. The no-man's land alongside the bridge is patrolled by teams who must be ever wary of the presence of booby traps or land mines.\r\n\r\nOn one night though shots ring out, 2 North Korean soldiers are killed, apparently by a South Korean soldier named Sgt Lee Soo Hyuk on a road who has confessed but refuses to talk further. In fact neither side wants to talk about it. \r\n\r\nLee Soo Hyuk is condemned by the Northern forces and protected by the South, with each party possessing such a strong bias a neutral investigation is commenced lead by Major Sophie Jean, a Swiss resident with Korean ties and a mastery of the language.\r\n\r\nIn interviews and flashbacks the real story gradually unfolds, nothing is as simple - or funnily enough as complicated - as it first seems.\r\n\r\nIt is not fair to the film to say much more, I will say that it takes time for the real events to unravel but it is worth the wait. Being a Park Chan-Wook film it is well acted and immaculately paced, and JSA also contains some moments of great innocence and humanity. In fact the final truth is far more 'boring' and human than anyone might guess from the serious tone of the first few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe film is laid out in three chapters, the first shows the viewpoint of the investigators, the second the actual events from the soldier's point of view and the third the conclusion and ultimately the truth.\r\n\r\nJSA is never less than intriguing and even though it isn't as great as the Vengeance trilogy it possesses perhaps the strongest final frame in almost any film that I can recall.\r\n\r\nFinal Rating - 8 / 10. A who-dunnit with a difference. An extremely effective drama with a strong cast, a great plot and the usual exceptional direction of a modern day master.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com for over 700 reviews and plenty more good stuff...",

None the less, it is still an engaging who done it and an interesting glimpse into the psyche of a nation divided.",
