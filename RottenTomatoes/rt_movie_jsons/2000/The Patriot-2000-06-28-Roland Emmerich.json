            "content": "the Movie The patriot was absolutely a great movie. The Theme of the movie is to never give up and fight for what you want. They wanted to be independent without Britain in the way so they could build their own country on their own. That means that if the people in the war are determined to win the way they will put everything they have into it and win for what they want. War was very scary,people had to sacrifice their family, and their home. They let everything go to go fight for there country\n The movie seemed very accurate for times then, it seemed accurate in many different ways. One of them was how they respected their elders and only called their dad \"father\". Another way I noticed it was accurate for the time it took place was the outfits they were wearing. They were all dressed like they were from around that era. If you look at times from then to now it's a very different time. The film had a lot of major events and showed many different aspects from it. It showed the era very well. How people dressed, acted, spoke was all very accurate. One major event that also happened in war was Gabriel dying in war.Death is a huge part of war that happens so it was appropriate for the movie maker to show death and fighting for what you want. .I wouldn't add or take away anything from the film. It was a very well put together film showing history through the film.One thing they could have done better was when benjamin was about to die in a field, but survived and skipped to him back home doing great. I wish this part of the movie had a little more closure to the end of the war. Thats why i rated the movie 4.5 just over all great movie",

Its also a bit cheesy at times with the childrens response to him being away at war but I guess I appreciate the whole 'is war worth it?' theme/aspect.\n\nHeath Ledger does well and its a good enough type of a war film but it does literally go on quite a while - nearly 3 hours. I couldn't help but wonder if it needed to be quite so long. I'm not sure I'd specifically recommend this film as such, no.",

It is occasionally unrealistic (the final battle seems to be largely won by running up a hill and waving a flag). But really - who cares? It is gloriously, beautifully cinematic, with a superb script. The cinematography is simply stunning - and the planning that went into some of the shots (as a filmmaker myself) I almost can't fathom. The story manipulates your emotions with incredible sophistication - I DARE you not to care about the family caught in the middle of this civil war, or to not want the villains defeated or dead. Mel Gibson is superbly nuanced in this movie, and on far more familiar ground than the forced Braveheart.   Heath Ledger winsomely plays his son, and Jason Isaac and Tom Wilkinson provide an indulgence of British villainy (just one of these would have carried the movie - two is a embarrassment of riches). There is room for humor, for touching moments. It's long, but earns its length. But best of all are the exhilirating and tense action pieces - in the end this IS an action movie, not a drama. Guerilla warfare is always fun to watch - and I've actually been using this movie to teach students about the recent Russian Ukraine conflict - as there are comparisons. No, leave your history books and prejudices against Gibson at the door - this is a storytelling and cinematic masterpiece, and it is really hard to think of a better war movie in the same vein. Thinking. Last Samurai comes close - but it's not really fully a war movie. Saving Private Ryan is more real, but far less charming. Robin Hood Prince of Thieves? Great Escape? Inglorious Bastards? No. Fail. Because, in fact, many of the contenders are not really war movies - or not entirely. This is. The war is the whole shebang. There is no better war movie. Prove me wrong.",

            "content": "As far as films go, this one isn't the best, but isn't the worst either. A typical Gibson cliche film. It allows you to truly hate the characters portrayed and to love them too but that serves as a problem because it is once again the typical 'England bad' type of film. For example, the American revolution is portrayed as a glorious, freedom taking adventure fought British V American colonists, but that's not the case. If anything, it was the first American civil war. Loyalists were fighting rebels (only 1/3 of the 13 colonies wished to break away from the UK) and after the revolution, several loyalists were deported away never to see America again. As well as this, any first time viewer would think that America has always been a nation of liberty and greatness when this is not the case given that black people were only allowed by law to be equals in the 1960s. However, to be totally fair, the battle sequences and the costumes are phenomenal but my issue is, it's just too one sided. The Patriot presents a story of a plantation owner who's farm is worked by free black men, how patronizing. Overall, this film is well written in the sense that it it plays to the viewer's emotions but is very demonizing to the British empire (which, contrary to SJWs, was not all bad). I would not recommend the film but I would say it is good writing to make the viewer sympathize with Martin. Even if his story is totally false.",

Mel Gibson plays this militant \"ghost\" who can singlehandedly hunt down and kill British soldiers on his own (with the help of his pre-pubescent children) but wouldn't commit to enlisting until his son died?  That's a story about a grieving father set on seeking personal revenge, not patriotism.  You could also argue that his actions/failure to enlist cost him a second son too, as if he had of enlisted earlier, his son may have stayed home.  A huge amount of the movie had needless and awkward dialogue and the acting was good at times, but mostly subpar.  There were some great moments sprinkled in there throughout but it's certainly not a movie I'd be in a rush to watch again and as an immigrant living in America, it felt a bit propaganda(y) to me.  One thing that I quite liked was their take on that era and I felt the throwback was captured well.  Worth a watch if you're a fan of the historical warfare genre, but \"meh, it passed the time\" pretty much sums up my experience while watching The Patriot.",

            "content": "When it comes to badly done historical films, Mel Gibson has the rights. Hollywood's attempts to rewrite history are most obvious to history buffs like myself. Details are changed or just flat out ignored. Anything which could reflect badly on the US or rebel/patriot cause is not in this film. And with such a big budget at risk, how could it? It's only purpose is to present a overly romantic depiction of American history and to glorify 'patriotism'  so much, to such an extent that the amount of flag waving bullsh*t in this picture is frankly eyerolling. I could excuse this cringe. If it wasnt at the expense of history. This film outright lies to its audience. Which it clearly considers to be a bunch of little sensitive children who cant handle the truth. \n\nThe film begins in 1776 just before the signing of the Declaration. An uneasy time. Tensions are high. They think about breaking away from the British Empire and establishing their own nation. But contrary to popular belief today. Not everyone wanted independence at that point in time. America was not United. Many consider it to be a civil war. The \"Tories\" (loyalists) consider the British to be legitimate government troops.. many loyalists joined the British army out of patriotism. And many of the native American Indian tribes sided with the British. And in 1776 only about 1/3 of America's population  support independence. The 'patriot' completely ignore all this. The only loyalist in the film is made out to be a Judas. Who is terrible. Taxation without representation was important and a just cause, obviously. But this film bearly cares about the reason behind this. Britain backed down again and again on taxing the colonists. Until they didn't. With the tax on tea. But the colonists were having none of it. There are so many other inaccuracies I could name, such as the film contradicting real life events like the British making a deal with the natives to secure them their own land with the Royal proclamation line of 1763. Hence the reason the Indians always sided with the Brits. This is contradicted in the film by having the two villains scheme about Ohio. Western expansion was inevitable, yes.. but this early on? The colonists had no representation in parliament or opportunity to move westward and so revolution escalated into war. \n\n2.Slaves\nThe character Benjamin Martin is probably based of several historical figures in late British America. But the most relevant is Francis Marion of South Carolina. His militia where brutally effective against the Brits using gorilla warfare tactics. But he was not married until after the war. That doesnt bother me much. It's the fact that Ben Martin has \"free men\" working on his land. That's disgusting. Offensive even. Francis Marion was a slave owner! Funnily enough. His slaves escaped from his plantation to fight for the British. \nI dont look upon past events with my modern morals but this is just offensive. \nThey make out the British to be using slaves as tools of war. But the Americans do the same thing in the very next scene. But they use a different tone. The fact is when the British declared they would free any slave and pay those who served in the British military, it scared the American 'Patriots'. So when they did the same thing, they did it out of necessity not because they wanted too. \n3. Atrocities \nThe redcoat caricatures are laughable. So villainous you cant take it seriously. \nThe whole film can be summed up in what Gen. Cornwallis said \"These rustics are so ineptable. Nearly takes the honour out of victory. Nearly.\" \n\nNow, in war, every side commits atrocities. The British included. But this film just makes stuff up that never happened.  To the point where they depict them burning down a church filled with innocent men, women and children. Shooting injured POWs. They never did this. Its fiction. In the Boston massacre only 5 or 6 people died. Thats the most massively non- massacre massacre I've ever heard of. This type of thing is what the nazis did. Like in June 10th 1944. In a village in France a similar church burning happened which was committed by the SS.\nThis film is so over the top. The main character stabs Tavington's horse with the American flag. I laughed at that I must admit. Nice symbolism. \n\nAll I suggest is you should have a film be based on real history. Instead of BS. \nThere is one final thing I think I should address about this picture. Its not nearly as offensive as its depiction of slavery or fake atrocities. But its worth thinking about. The film is meant to champion the best about the U.S. The problem is the ideas it brings up are modern.. not those which actually existed back then. \nMost of the African Americans that fought for the freedom of the U.S never got their freedom. Native American Indians where killed for supporting the British or pushed out of their native land And 100,000 American Tories (loyalists) where expelled from their country of birth or where persecuted, tarred and feathered because of their loyalty to the crown. The one slave in the film gets his freedom (even though he wouldn't have in real life unless he had fought for the British) but he gets it. And what does he want to do with it? He wants to help Ben Martin build his house! Good God. What a slap in the face. \n\nIt's a shame that this film has promoted misconceptions and ignorance to audiences. All because the people involved in the making of it thought that an American audience was too sensitive to hear the truth? Or was it just to make money? Who knows  \n\nI cant reccomend this ball achingly inaccurate tripe.",

But seriously, I actually really like this movie. While there's the obvious critical research failure you'd expect from a Roland Emmerich film, the main villain being cartoonishly evil and the bloated runtime, this is still a really well-made war drama. The performances are great, the action sequences are gripping, the cinematography is lovely, John Williams delivers another great score and, despite the overemphasis of British atrocities, Jason Isaacs makes for a great, genuinely threatening villain who you want to see get his just deserts. After all, he crosses the moral event horizon in his first few minutes of screentime long before that infamous, albeit terrifying, scene that's the bane of history buffs' existence. Given how bad most of Roland Emmerich's work is, I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. Just accept this as historical fiction and focus more on the compelling, poignant storyline and you just might find yourself considering this to be the director's best movie to date.",

Mel Gibson also does an amazing job playing Benjamin Martin, a South Carolina farmer who doesn't want to get involved in the Revolution.

            "content": "Okay so I know what people are thinking if I was going to review The Patriot when they're thinking about the Steven Seagal version of The Patriot which has nothing to do with historical Revolutionary War. Mel Gibson gained on Braveheart before this came out. Why did I say that? It's because the battle scenes are similar. Hey, I haven't seen it I just know it. Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin the veteran of the French and Indian War and a widowed father of seven children. He refuses to go to war but his eldest son, Gabriel played by Heath Ledger goes to war to join the Continentals against his father's wishes. Colonel William Tavington played by Jason Isaacs and his army of British redcoats arrive to the house, captured Gabriel, Thomas tried to stopped them but is shot dead by Tavington calling him a stupid boy. So when their house got burned down, it's up to Benjamin to take down the redcoats. He and Gabriel joined up with his army of friends to take down a bunch of British redcoats once of for all to protect their family. So it's not that long for an epic war film but it does have some slow-paced moments that do fit for some part. As much as I enjoyed most of the action in the war it gets bloody. What people like especially women is the costume design. But there's only one scene that got to me in tears is where Benjamin's daughter, Susan telling him not to leave and she'll say anything he wants but he promises her he'll be back. That scene gets me anytime it gets emotional. I'm not gonna lie, it really did get me. Years ago this is something I checked out before I checked out the Lethal Weapon films now that's saying something 'cause I said before that Mel Gibson is one of my favourite actors of all time. I know there are people out there who don't really like the movie mainly because of it's antics of the American's hatred on the British and the Britain's hatred on the Americans especially when those redcoat b*****d's murdering innocent people, destroying their homes and families. But I'm not one of those people who hate this film, I liked it. It may not historically accurate but it is a fantastic war film with some good cinematography which really made the film look real in the war. Actually I heard somebody in the film mention the word \"accurate\". Mel Gibson, his character said it and the second time somebody else said it. Well, that's just the fact.

Most war films, no matter what their setting, build gradually to a momentous climax. This doesn't happen during The Patriot. There is a big skirmish at the end, but it doesn't seem like the culmination of all that has preceded it. Great battle scenes in movies stir the blood; this one left me cold. Overall, the pacing is uneven and the tone monotonous. With only a couple of exceptions, Emmerich fails to generate tension. The Patriot is a disappointment.

            "content": "This film came out around the same time as star Mel Gibson's \"Braveheart\" and I remember people thinking he'd directed this film as well, particularly because of savage battle scenes. However, \"The Patriot\" was directed by Roland Emmerich, the reliable producer/writer/director of many enjoyable but empty headed summer popcorn films, including \"Independence Day,\" \"White House Down,\" and \"Stargate.\" While most of his films are unchallenging crowd pleasers, \"The Patriot\" stands apart in his filmography as quality piece of filmmaking. The film was written by Robert Rodat, who also wrote \"Saving Private Ryan,\" and he brings the same mix of realism and and emotion to the American Revolutionary War that he brought to WWII. Mel Gibson plays a farmer and retired war hero who wants nothing more than to left alone with his family and to run his farm. However, Gibson is pushed to his limits by Jason Isaacs, best known as the sneering Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter films, who play as a sneering British Colonel. Gibson's fictional Benjamin Martin is an amalgam of several Revolutionary War heroes, but primarily seems to be based upon Francis Marion, The Swamp Fox, who was a pivotal figure during the war, leading a group of irregular soldiers in a guerrilla war against the British in South Carolina, even after the Continental Army had been driven out the state. After Gibson's son, Heath Ledger, is captured by Issacs, Gibson leads his own ragtag band of soldiers against the redcoats using what was at the time was very unusual guerrilla tactics. The small and large scale action sequences in \"The Patriot\" are the real highlight of the film. They are exciting, brutally realistic, and most importantly, are emotionally poignant. There is an early scene in the film when Gibson ambushes a British detail to free his captured son, Ledger, where he uses his very young sons as his soldiers, and the filmmakers don't shy away from the young children's shock at their father telling them how to kill men, as well as taking time to show the aftermath and their reaction to their father's brutality. Besides being and exciting and unflinching in it's graphic and realistic presentation of war, it's the emotional component that elevates \"The Patriot\" from simply being a technically effective crafted battle sequence. However, although the film does a fine job of presenting a realistic depiction of war for this time period and also does an excellent job of period detail in terms of costumes, architecture, and set decor, the film grossly fails in it's whitewashing of history in an attempt to present a politically correct hero who's more palatable to audiences.. As I said before, \"The Patriot\" is a work of fiction, but having Gibson's Martin \"paying\" his black farmworkers instead of owning slaves seems wildly disingenuous (Francis Marion owned slaves). Additionally, the real-life Francis Marion committed many war atrocities, even by the standards of his time, which are completely absent in this film, although there are hints of something in Gibson's past during the French and Indian War. If \"The Patriot\" had been as honest in it's depiction of history in these respects as it had been in it's depiction of warfare, this film may have been a true classic. Despite this major lapse, \"The Patriot\" remains a strong piece of filmmaking, with an emotional center that focuses around family, which gives the film a resonance that is lacking from many war films. Well worth watching despite it's flaws.",

In particular, I found that the action was very entertaining, especially the first scene where he fights with the tomahawk. I don't know, there's just something about tomahawks that I find more amusing than any other weapon. \n\nNow, I understand that this movie is not without it's flaws. It can be quite melodramatic at times and it's practically Braveheart set during the Revolutionary War. Also, it's not historically accurate. However, what needs to be understood is that this film, like Braveheart, is historical fiction. Therefore, I don't think it's fair to judge this film because it's not based on a true story. But it does serve an overarching purpose, and that purpose was to simply show that the Revolutionary War sucked. The victory was sweet, but American citizens lost much in the process. Nobody was really safe. And trust me, this movie hits that fact hard with a vengeance. Also, Jason Isaac's, \"Colonel Tavington\", is one of the most abhorrent, hateable villains I've ever seen. Seriously, he's almost as bad as Commodus in Gladiator and I REALLY hated that guy.\n\nOverall, I loved the patriot. It's an inspiring film that really helped show how hard the Revolutionary War must have been for some. Yes, it's pretty melodramatic at times and it's basically American Braveheart (except not really). However, in the end, The Patriot is a emotional, fun film to watch that I always enjoy going back to.",

Sadly, it kills the real stories of men who really did make major influences in the revolution like Roger's Rangers - the precursor to our modern Army Rangers. Additionally, it white washes absurdly. A slave is told 'we'll make a new world where all men are created equal under God' by Gibson's son. Really? So it was this random dude who invented that line? Did I mention this takes place in the SOUTH?!? Additionally, while the slave fighting with them faces some harassment, for the most part, slaves are treated quite nicely. One soldier, the most racist one, at the end even turns to the slave and tells him how honored he was to serve with him. Really? Cheese factor 10. At one point, families are hidden in a slave village, yet everyone gets along just hunky dory. Really???. Then for some reason, they leave their safety and of course bad things happen. Why didn't they stay? There's predictable scenes, like the one where an entire British unit is wiped out, but the head bad guy gets away. Another where Gibson runs along the line carrying the flag, rallying the troops, much like a scene from Braveheart. It so badly portrays historical events, it makes the whole movie a waste of time.",

            "content": "Teaming up a powerful actor like Mel Gibson with a spectacle filmmaker like Roland Emmerich, The Patriot sounded like an entertaining epic.\n\nIt's a no-brainer that Roland Emmerich is not the greatest storyteller in the world as his films rely more frequently on expensive production values to captivate the audience. The Patriot is of course no exception, although its nature as a civil war film means that there isn't any room for visual effects. The film has to be constructed out of practical elements, and with Roland Emmerich as the director it succeeds at that very gracefully.\nThe Patriot isn't meant to be any kind of intellectually stimulating, it is clearly intended to be marketed as a blockbuster, making use of familiar elements to draw fans of existing themes in. This means that the film relies on a pre-established formula as the basis of its narrative, and it manages to integrate in predictable plot points from many genres to form a singular story. While loosely working as a historical war epic, The Patriot progressively draws in story elements particularly familiar of the action genre, pushing the film to focus more on its action than its story. Since the action is part of the spectacle in the film it manages to work, but it simply means that The Patriot ends up following a meandering path. But then again, that is to be expected from the beginning.  But since it stays on this path for a running time of nearly three hours and takes a lot of slow breaths between the action scenes where these formulaic plot points unfold, it is certainly a bit of a stretch.\nIn all essence the film is not bereft of death because amid its overly familiar themes are an effective reminder of just what kind of unexpected challenges one must face in war and there is tenacious acting to bring the material to life. Nevertheless, the film is an exercise in style above all else. And of course, it is a powerful one. Starting with powerful scenery and building up from there, The Patriot is packed with decorations all the way to the brim with rich costumes and production design. All this is captured with brilliant cinematography which effectively finds the correct balance between capturing the epic spectacle of the scenery and also working to find the detail in the facial expressions of the actors by zeroing in on them. But all the production values of the film come to an endeavour when the film actually enters war territory and becomes a spectacle of combat. Roland Emmerich has proven countless times just how well he can put together an effective action scene, and The Patriot features some of his most beautiful work. Instead of relying strictly on effects this time, Roland Emmerich manages to find a balance for his sense of style and some impressive choreography. The Patriot is packed with predominantly two kinds of action scenes: shootouts and close combat. The shootouts are impressively staged down to the finest detail, and yet the close combat scenes manage to transcend them even further. Both make a strong use of blood and slow motion while showing a large scope of battle going on, but the close combat also relies on extensive choreography work which the actors take on as a challenge and manage to completely blitz. The Patriot manages to fill its long running time with a sufficient quantity of action scenes between the periods of drama, and it certainly manages to fill the generic contract and create a spectacle of both genuinely great imagery and brilliant action. \nOne of the finest technical assets from The Patriot is the musical score. The composer is one who is so iconic that he could be recognized by the deaf, a man responsible for creating many of the most iconic film scores of all time. The name be John Williams, and his work on The Patriot is truly stunning. With dedication to capturing the epic scope of the narrative and bringing the emotional atmosphere of the material to prominence, John Williams turns The Patrior into a treat for the ears in the same way Roland Emmerich does it for the eyes. John Williams proves once more that he never fails to create poetry with his music.\nAnd though the script does take the audience through familiar territory, the cast in The Patriot all deliver extremely firm performances.\nMel Gibson is the standout. Having proven that he can lead an epic spectacle to the tune of the Academy Award winning Braveheart (1995), The Patriot is essentially routine for him. However, his performance clearly is not. The man knows what scale the film is going for and has no problem living up to it because he dedicates all his energy to the every theme in the film. When he has to go into speaking for extensive periods of time about his passion for his country, his patriotism rings true brilliantly enough to live up to the title of the film. When he is sent into war, he maintains an intense stare and grip over his weapon which turns into the swift movements of a trained warrior. And when the material really breaks into the heart of the character Benjamin Martin, Mel Gibson has no problem expressing the vulnerabilities of the character by really bringing himself to tears and showing a physical state of absolute emotion. Mel Gibson powerfully captures both the raw side of his character and the sophisticated demeanour while letting his natural charm overtake the part during the less melodramatic scenes, so the man proves a likable and gripping star while also delivering the goods during the action scenes.\nHeath Ledger also delivers a brilliant effort. Being an accomplished Australian actor like Mel Gibson, the fact that he comes from the next generation makes the father and son sentiment of The Patriot seem all the more legitimate. And you can see elements of a young Mel Gibson's talent in Heath Ledger due to his natural charm and youthful innocence as well as his determination to take a stand. Heath Ledger provides a likable presence the entire time but also engages with Mel Gibson on the same level as him, creating chemistry so organic that the drama just flows through the film whenever he is on the screen. Heath Ledger is perfectly dramatic yet always appropriately restrained in The Patriot, proving the extent of his talents in a big-budget film.\nChris Cooper also delivers a strong supporting effort, and Adam Baldwin is a welcome face to see.\n\nSo The Patriot is a predictable film due to its reliance on a pre-existing formula of cliches over the course of its long story, but with Mel Gibson's tenacious leading performance and Roland Emmerich's keen eye for brilliant imagery,  it doesn't fail to entertain.",

As a piece of entertainment, this film was very enjoyable to watch and I would definitely watch it again.  Mel Gibson did an excellent job as militia leader, Benjamin Martin.  However, this film is somewhat historically inaccurate.  Its major flaw in historical accuracy is how the British were portrayed; they were portrayed to be cruel, cold-blooded killers or even like German Nazis.  The commit inhumane, genocidal acts such as shooting innocent people and children, burning colonists' houses, and even burning churches filled with people.  The British soldiers in the 1770s would never commit such acts, as they would've been brought up on severe court charges or even executed.  They also knew that doing acts like these would anger the colonists and cause them to rebel even more.  For example, one of the most widely known events of the British doing harm against the colonists is the Boston Massacre.  The British troops were instructed to maintain civil order within the colonies.  When colonists rioted and provoked the British soldiers, they opened fired and five were killed.  This act does not way in comparison to how British Colonel Tavington and his soldiers in \"The Patriot\" locked at least 50 innocent people in a small church and burned them all alive.  Again, the British would never do this, which is why this film is historically inaccurate.  The writers portrayed the British like this simply for adding more emotional impact on viewers.  But, I enjoyed this movie very much anyways and would recommend it, especially if you enjoy historical or action and war movies.",

            "content": "During the American Revolution in 1776, Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), a veteran of the French and Indian War and widower with seven children, is called to Charleston to vote in the South Carolina General Assembly on a levy supporting the Continental Army. Fearing war against Great Britain, Benjamin abstains. Captain James Wilkins votes against and joins the Loyalists. A supporting vote is nonetheless passed and against his father's wishes, Benjamin's eldest son Gabriel (Heath Ledger) joins the Continental Army.Four years later in 1780, Charleston falls to the British and a wounded Gabriel returns home carrying dispatches. The Martins care for both British and American wounded from the nearby battle, before British Dragoons, led by the ruthless Colonel William Tavington (Jason Isaacs), arrive and arrest Gabriel. When Benjamin's young son Thomas tries to free Gabriel, he is shot and killed by Tavington, who orders the Martins' house burned and wounded Americans executed. After the British leave, Benjamin gives his next two eldest sons muskets and they ambush the British unit escorting a tied Gabriel. Benjamin skillfully, yet brutally, kills many soldiers with his tomahawk. A British survivor tells Tavington of the attack, earning Benjamin the moniker of the \"Ghost\". Benjamin quickly finds himself torn between protecting his family, and seeking revenge along with being a part of the birth of a new, young, and ambitious nation...\n\n\"The Patriot\" is set during the American Revolution, a time that has always fascinated me for severals reasons. I reckon it takes me back to my childhood reading the comic \"Tomahawk\" and as well thinking about the fantastic \"The Last Of The Mohicans\" set in the same century. The film carries resemblances with \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" and adventure movies such as \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\" and Gibson´s own \"Braveheart\", but in this case we truly end up in the stereotypical and tiresome US flag waving and \"home of the brave, land of the free\" tone which is my minus in the movie. Yes, they fought for the country and their lives, but the over dramatisation becomes a bit too much in my book. Roland Emmerich has created a lavish and grande costume drama that feels accurate in many ways, despite the fact that he has taken several creative liberties and with the ensemble (Gibson is fine as Benjamin, even if he sometimes is a bit over the top and Jason Isaacs is as evil as one can be) the movie gets several layers, but there´s too many big names that ends up as background props and \"The Patriot\" becomes a one man star vehicle with Gibson having a bit too much screen time. Emmerich´s handling of the battle sequences is fine and the grim view of the battle field in 1776 is truly in your face with cannonballs literally tearing heads off. One can only wonder how they came up with the battle strategies back then as it´s not a question if you will die rather when you will die. The emotional layer with Benjamin losing two of his sons makes if quite easy to accept his rampage and anger which fuels his will for revenge. I loved the idea of him melting his sons tin soldiers into bullets. One can however question all the atrocities the british are accused of in the movie and how they are portrayed and as well how \"heroic\" the americans are portrayed as despite all sorts of violent acts. I reckon criticism is in it´s place here. I did however like \"The Patriot \" in general despite flaws and minuses.",

When I first saw it, I remember liking it because this was part of Mel Gibson's serious phase (post Mad Max and Lethal Weapon flix) and liking this side of his acting ability, plus Heath Ledger was an up-and-coming star who was both a talented actor and good-looking. Watching it now though, makes me a little sad because I think of the talent lost when Ledger passed and can only imagine how great he would have been. But back to the film. Back in the days the only attraction to this film was Mel Gibson, but having watched it again, I love the fact that there are so many familiar faces in this film that I failed to appreciate the first time I watched it: namely the gorgeous and talented Jason Isaacs, who plays Col. William Tavington, but is better known to me as the luscious Lucius Malfoy from the Potter series and my favorite dual-reality-challenged detective, Michael Britten, from the t.v. series \"Awake\". It's always a treat to watch any film with the ever talented, Tom Wilkinson (who played Gen. Lord Charles Cornwallis) and Chris Cooper, Col. Harry Burwell, because they give such awesome performances with every role they play. I also now appreciate more the performances of character actors like Joely Richardson (Charlotte Selton), who was also in the series \"Nip/Tuck\" and Donal Logue (Dan Scott), who plays Det. Bullock in the t.v. series Gotham. But as wonderful as all these seasoned acting veterans were, I must admit that the performance that moved me to tears and the sole reason I watched this film again was the scene where little Susan Martin (played Skye McCole Bartusiak) asks her father (played by Mel Gibson) to stay. Argh, if that doesn't move you, I'd check for a pulse. It was brilliant and made the film worth seeing. Other than that, this movie was just plain interesting to watch (I can't attest to accuracy) but it was entertaining and I can honestly say one of Mel Gibson's better projects. The story was fascinating, the characters were multi-layered and overall enjoyable because it send you as the audience on a roller-coaster of emotions and entertains you that you barely notice how lengthy the film was.",

I hadn't seen this for several years and I remembered why I avoided it when it was on TV (other than the length) Jason Isaacs is just such a bad, bad man, he's like Hitler bad in his portrayal of Col. William Tavington. Cold, calculated, brutal as he rides in and destroys lives, spouting off orders to kill the prisoners, hang your son, burn the barn, burn the house, and shoot the \"silly boy.\" Just an epic bad guy on a level that's hard to watch. \n\nI found the movie itself pretty much without faults, sure its a bit too long in it's sweeping saga and is essentially Braveheart in America but Mel gives a great performance as peaceful farmer Benjamin Martin, who is driven to take up arms takes up arms and lead the Colonial Militia during the American revolution after a sadistic British officer murders his son. The entire cast is great (sigh Heath Ledger)  and the cinematography is gorgeous, I mean like every single frame in this is beautiful. The attention to period detail is also flawless, the costumes, set design and battles. -which BTW drove me crazy, what a ridiculas way to fight a war; walking in formation to the beat of a drum and just standing there while the other side shoots at you \"ready, aim, fire\" and then you shoot back at them while the  generals look on.

The few times special effects are needed they turn out very good, but generally the movie does a good job of doing it the real and better way instead.  The story itself is pretty good, with the unusual use of both father and son fighting the enemy side by side.  The story does seem overly patriotic, but that is what the movie is about, and it still has its tragic moments.  There is of course the main enemy commander who personally wants Mel Gisons character dead, so they have their deadly encounters.

That's really what it comes down. Performances are pretty good, action pretty great, and there's enough cliched drama points to please a standard viewer. The thing to me that pushes this above just \"good\" is the what it means to me. It may be a bit corny, and it really has nothing to do with the content of the film but, hey it's my review. My dad and I generally don't agree on much, this includes movie choice. Since he's a big fan of mindless action films, and normally mindless war flicks, it made sense that he would take to this movie. I decided to indulge him and watch it, and it turns out I liked it as well. The best thing comes from how this movie brings us together. Father and son consistently butt-heads, and my case is no different than anyone else's. But, when one of us pulls up this movie, all is forgiven.

The cast is nothing short of outstanding, Jason Isaacs standing out in particular as a bloodthirsty British officer. The score by John Williams is fantastic, and perfectly captures the mood and atmosphere of the story and setting. Everything is beautifully shot. The action scenes are pretty intense, and the scenery of the American frontier is truly a sight to behold. Let's not forget about the scene where Mel Gibson goes full Assassin's Creed III.\nOverall, I loved The Patriot.

            "content": "Considering the patriots won the war they wrote the history books. Clearly the writer of this movie fell victim to that tweaked, tainted and bias view our nation has, in the writing of this film. For one I think if a man single handedly turned the war around his name would be more well-known than that of George Washington. If a man and his two young sons alone took down twenty redcoats I think that would be a more famous story in the common household than the well know story of Christopher Columbus (aside from the heap of rubbish the most commonly told version of that story is) and even that of old Saint Nick. I did rather enjoy seeing Mr. Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) in there, once again not so honorably batting for the losing side. It was a powerful movie but do you honestly think the militia would have had enough food to keep both themselves and two dogs well fed, no. It was extremely unrealistic in that it did not so much as touch on the true hardships of being a traveling solider and all that one must endure. More accurately they would be starving and sick some with no coats or shoes. The part about not being looked down on if you don't join the militia or come back to it, was clearly not true. You were not free to leave without persecution from your fellow men. What was portrayed here was but a dream that we have pleasantly painted for ourselves in place of the truth. If you didn't agree to join and help the patriot cause in every way that you could you were no better than a tory to them. They would have nothing to do with you unless it was to ridicule your choices. The scene in the church however was accurate to the serious glorification of war that went on then as well as it goes on now to trick young men into signing over their lives. For a nation that loves putting down the British in the process of our learning about the revolution and the events that took place, a man who went around burning down the homes of militia men and killing innocent family members and friends I think would be at top of their list to teach us in schools all across our beloved nation. I particularly think that we have glorified and justified all of our foolish and unreasoned actions with this movie. We did not just run head first into some strong willed uprising.  What truly happened is we time and time again wanted to have our cake and eat it to. We went from want to fight to asking for amends until war actually broke out. We viscously used propaganda in things such as the famous picture of what happened at \"The Boston Massacre\" to rally up an unneeded war and a powerful want for rioting. We wanted the rights of Englishmen without the responsibility. We were at one point offered representation but turned it down.  Yes it would have been small and outnumbered at first but it was a start we willing chose to turn down. In the movie the one white man asked, what would a black man do with freedom? Well what did we do with it? We tax our people. We have shady government members. We have plenty of unjust things happening in our \"free country\" and our \"new world\" that go unrecognized and brushed under the carpet. If we truly had the spirit of being free rather than the spirit of rioting then slavery would have been abolished along with the rein of the king. But instead we let movies like this, based off the minds of people who have fell victim to this heroification, cloud our eyes. In reality, our actions resembled that of whiny children.",

And while The Patriot is basically American Braveheart, Mel Gibson deserves great credit for turning what should be a flop into a compelling film.  It's difficult not to be drawn in by the facets of his character: tender father, cunning soldier and raging vengeance monster.  Heath Ledger does well playing off Gibson in their father-son role, as if Gibson was passing the torch to a new upcoming star.  Together, they deliver many of the film's lighter moments.  The Patriot sets out to play on our heart more than our brain, and it succeeds.  It's hard not to hate Jason Isaac's immoral Col. Tavington, and as a result, it's hard not to root for Gibson's righteous & repentant Benjamin Martin to come out on top.",

Benjamin Martin played by Mel Gibson who has fought bravely in the French-Indian wars but since the death of his wife, he has renounced violence and is quietly tending his crops, raising his seven children alone. In 1776, Benjamin's oldest son Gabriel played by the late Heath Ledger goes out to battle against the British and returns seriously wounded with Lord General Cornwallis played by Tom Wilkinson calling for his arrest. A skirmish breaks out on Benjamin's plantation causing his second oldest son Thomas to be murdered and Gabriel is captured by Col. Tavington played by Jason Isaacs who sentences Gabriel to be hung. Benjamin sets aside  his vow of pacifism and rescues Gabriel with the help of Harry Burwell played by Chris Cooper. The film is loosely adapted from the true story of Francis Marion and was filmed in South Carolina. While the film proves that you don't need so much to show that your movie is dark but this film follows the patriotic mood of Independence Day by being so overly melodramatic. I know so many people hated that movie for the same reason but I absolutely love that movie. I like this movie but not that much for that same reason. The Patriot gets a weak 8/10.",

The reason why is because Mel Gibson isn't a whiney baby, except for some scenes, but that's because both of his sons died from the redcoats. The villain, who is the Dragoon commander, is a little bit crazy. He just kills any patriot in his way without being given an order. The battle scenes are thrilling to watch. I like the scene when a cannon ball hits someone's head off. The Patriot is a great to watch if your a big war movie fan or if you wanna watch it on the 4th of July. Like me!

He is totally against the brewing conflict with the British, and is at odds with his eldest son \"Gabriel\" (Heath Ledger), who is for going to war with Britain. The rift between the two over the war spreads more when \"Gabriel\" joins the militia when the state representatives, one of which is his father, votes to enter the war. However, \"Benjamin\" was one of the 12 to vote against entering the war. \r\n\r\nThen, after a battle just yards away from the Martin Plantation, \"Benjamin,\" his other children and the slaves on the plantation are taking care of injured from both sides of that battle when a group of Redcoats come up to the plantation to take their wounded to get better medical help, and kills the revolutionists. And when \"Gabriel,\" who returned to the plantation the night before seriously injured, is discovered with communications and is taken into custody. One of \"Gabriel's\" younger brothers tries to interfere, and is shot in the back and dies in his father's arms. \"Benjamin,\" with his two youngest sons, go looking for the troops responsible for killing his son and torching his property. \r\n\r\nNow, \"Benjamin\" has revenge in his heart and realizes that \"Gabriel\" was right about breaking away from the British crown. \r\n\r\nThe first thing you can't help but notice is the very accurate architecture, furnishings, weaponry and wardrobe. The producers used the Smithsonian Institute as a consultant in just about everything for accuracy. This really sets the setting of the movie quite nicely. \r\n\r\nAnother thing that stands out is the performances. I don't think one actor gave a weak performance. Even the supporting cast, many of which had characters who weren't strongly developed past their reasons for joining \"Benjamin,\" give good performances. \r\n\r\nBecause it's set in the Revolutionary War, there are battle scenes with graphic blood. The battles are nicely shot, especially when the camera is surrounded by the action at ground level. There is tons of action going on in these battle scenes, with lots of explosions. \r\n\r\nThe special effects are mainly blood packs, pyrotechnics, sounds of explosions and it looks like there is some CGI of the ocean with boats floating in it. The special effects are very effective in many scenes. \r\n\r\nThe cinematography is done nicely, even when the scenery is rather cramped. It is pretty hard to believe that the person responsible for finding locations for the film found any place where there was no modernization, but they did. \r\n\r\nThe phenomenal John Williams put together some good music for this movie. He was able to nail the emotion of the scenes rather nicely, as usual. \r\n\r\nThe only problem with this movie is that it's over three-hours long. However, you are so focused on what is going on in the film, you basically forget how long it is. \r\n\r\nThe movie, which is rated R, is not really for young children because of the violence. Older children may like it, if they can handle the length of the film. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, \"The Patriot\" would be a good first choice for rental.",

Nevertheless, the film has many strengths with respect to casting, costumes, props and visuals.
