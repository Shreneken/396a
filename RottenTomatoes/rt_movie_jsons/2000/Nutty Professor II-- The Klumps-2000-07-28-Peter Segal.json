Where it falls short is in its decision to rehash elements from its predecessor, Janet Jackson's character being such a blatant carbon copy of Jada Pinkett recently Smith that it makes one wonder why they made her a different character to begin with and the Klumps being less funnier in larger doses, not helped at all by the fact that their status as ascended extras ultimately has no effect on the plot. The Klumps is watchable - I prefer this Eddie Murphy sequel over Beverly Hills Cop III anyway - but is it any good? No dice.",

If the movie was based off them eating at a table for ninety minutes, I would've been fine with that. Some parts were hysterical, other parts went nowhere, and some were gross out. When I saw this I was younger and I found it funny. Even still today, it's funny but it should've been hysterical instead of being put in a sour note. I would rated this a three star rating, but so much humor you can quote it to this day it ranks it higher. It's worth a watch. I think you'll enjoy it.",
