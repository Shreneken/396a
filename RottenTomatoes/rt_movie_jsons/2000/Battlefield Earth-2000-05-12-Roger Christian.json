Eventually it settles down with the stupid ridiculousness and you get used to the motion sickness but you want it to end after the hour mark. This makes every single cut noticed and add the stupid slow motion in the action scenes and you get a uniquely bad film. No one should watch this without a vomit bag and be prepared to use it.",

            "content": "Como relato de ciencia ficción tiene una interesante premisa, pero la película la plasma de una manera bastante pobre. Toma ciertos elementos de la Cienciologia como usar a los Psychlos como alegorías de los psicólogos que según la Cienciologia solo buscan controlar la mente humana y sin olvidar mencionar la vida alienigena como verdadera creadora de la humanidad. Es una historia simple de un futuro dominado por extraterrestres y la lucha de la humanidad por recuperar su mundo. Es una historia bastante buena para un relato épico de ciencia ficción, pero tristemente a pesar del presupuesto, esta película no logro materializar esta historia de la manera que debería haber sido. La mayoría de los personajes son muy básicos y genéricos sin mucha profundidad. El personaje de Travolta en serio es todo un personaje de caricatura al punto que llega a ser un inepto y causa gracia en vez de intimidación. Nada mas el personaje de Forest Whitaker muestra algo de sentido común. La dirección y edición son muy desenfrenadas al punto en que uno puede perderse y tiene que usar la imaginación para entender que sucede. Es como si la película intentara marear al espectador. Las secuencias en cámara lenta la verdad están bien, pero hay que seguir el ritmo o parecen eternas. Los efectos digitales son básicos y simple lo cual hacen que esta película fuera hecha solo para formato casero. El guion en serio es bastante mediocre ya que hay ciertas incoherencias, agujeros y algunos errores que hacen que uno se pregunte como pudo pasar tal cosa. Incluso hay cosas que llegan a carecer de sentido. Battlefield Earth es una película que o tienes que verla con el cerebro apagado y déjate llevar por la acción que tiene o tienes que usar la imaginación para entender cosas que no explica del todo. No es la peor película que haya existido ya que al menos la historia esta buena, pero tiene tantas fallas en su desarrollo que termina siendo una película mediocre que a pocos les puede gustar. Aun así es una cinta bastante rara y bizarra que resulta ser entretenida y mas por la sobre actuación de Travolta que tristemente acabo su carrera, pero al menos dejo un villano tan caricaturesco y gracioso que no es fácil de olvidar. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 6/10.",

The alien technology is laughably incoherent, the whole premise of why the aliens are here seems like it was just told, not done, the way our heroes train and arm themselves is mind-bogglingly improbable (impossible doesn't even begin to describe it) and these are just a few plot holes. Add to that the acting, the way things just seem to happen randomly, the apparent incompetence of the aliens, how the baddie seems to treat our hero as human despite considering him an animal, and yeah, even though the movie is mildly entertaining if you are really hung over, it just contradicts logic too much to work.",

I will say that the plot is kind of original in a sense of a once technological species reduced to a primitive livlihood. The costumes (Psyclos) were great, the line-up of actors was cool, and the sets were pretty good. I watched it after reading alot of negative reviews, but like watching a house fire, I watched it all in its' entirely.  I'd like to know how they would've done a 2nd part.",

It should have been a pleasure to see Travolta and Whittaker in such fanciful roles and costumes, and it's a shame they won't make a sequel. We wanna see what happens next! Not.

It sucked, but Forrest is still the man and it's cool he fucked over Travolta! He gets his is in the end!

I would recommend reading the book before watching the movie. If you can make it through the book, you'll enjoy the movie.

Based on a work by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, this movie focuses on the ultraviolent alien species Psychlos that enslave and study the last living humans in the 31st Century. The humans rebel and join forces to destroy these damn dirty aliens once and for all. As a person who's not quite into science fiction movies, I found out early on why this movie is often considered the worst. The laughable Psychlo designs look like troll dolls covered in moss with dirty mops on their heads. Despite being the leader of the superior conquering alien race, Terl (John Travolta) has no idea how to communicate with the humans or what food they eat. The humans also have inconsistent tendencies, the shopping mall mannequin worshippers that give away their weapons to villains, but yet know to use a nuclear bomb to take out the Psychlos' planet. Seriously, you'd think Terl and his gang would have wiped out the human race on Earth with the use of radioactive fusion, rather than the other way around. So, with that said, Battlefield Earth is one miracle of a sci-fi flop. With the horrendous art direction, baffling idiotic inconsistencies and complete stupidity in the writing and characters, this movie is one giant intergalactic dog that has to be seen to be believed.

Watching Battlefield Earth is like taking a shit that just doesn't want to come out. It's frustrating, it's messy, and it only serves to screw up your day. In fact, this movie is so painful that I am forcing myself to watch it until I finish this review. Man, you should see how fast I'm typing right now.\n\nActing: 3\nLess than two minutes in, the movie has one of those bloodcurdling \"NO!\" screams after main character Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) finds out someone close to him has died. That's when I remember saying to myself: \"What the hell did I just get myself into? I gotta sit through the rest of this?\" You would think, \"Well, it's only uphill from here.\" You, madam or sir, would be wrong. From John Travolta and Forest Whitaker's painful performances as aliens to the rest of this horrid cast, I can't really decide who did the worst job. I gave them a 3 because, well, I'm assuming they showed up on set everyday.\n\nBeginning: 0\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 3\nFast forward to four minutes after the \"scream\". You see a bunch of cavemen (ish) beating up a prop from a broken down minigolf fun center. You see this happening with weird cut shots and slow motion, all while focusing on the anger and intent of the cavemen who see it as a threat. It is quite possibly one of the dumbest scenes I have seen in film. It angers me even now just thinking about it.\n\nConflict: 6\n\nEntertainment Value: 0\n\nMemorability: 0\nThe only thing I need to remember is this movie is garbage and to run if someone ever mentions watching it. There is nothing about this movie I will ever treasure.\n\nPace: 2\nLet me watch paint dry and see if I'm not more entertained. My wife captured a caterpillar in a jar recently because she thinks it may become a butterfly. I'm pretty sure it's dying because it only moves an inch every few hours. That inch outpaces the speed at which this movie drags along. Give me the DMV. Give me the longest wait at any Disneyworld ride. Give me the lines for the 2008 voting stations. I will take any of these things over Battlefield Earth.\n\nPlot: 0\n\nResolution: 1\nEnded just like it began: As a failed movie with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. \n\nOverall: 17\nI usually don't judge people on tastes. We're all different and we all like different things. But if you enjoyed this movie in any shape or fashion and you profess to be my friend, please lose my number. The passion with which I hate this movie has no end.",

If you'd like to see a good science fiction film, check out \"Close Encounters Of The Third Kind\", \"ET\", \"The Thing\", or the \"Back To The Future\" franchise, the \"Terminator\" films (earlier, although I didn't see them, I hear they're good), \"Scooby Doo And The Alien Invaders\", \"Marvin The Martian cartoons\", or the episode of \"Scooby Doo\" (original series) where Scooby and the gang encounter an alien, all of which are better than this hunk of garbage.

Not only that, Battlefield Earth is fill with plotholes that most people who are fans of the book (and yes this is based on a book) will be confused because I was. It is a movie so bad that I wonder why it got made in the first place. \n\nBattlefield Earth is fill with overacting (mainly John Travolta), like I just mention plotholes, saturated colors, and the more irritating of them all Dutch angles. And no the soundtrack is not good either. Well, you can't call it a soundtrack because atleast a soundtrack have a smooth sound to it like a Hans Zimmer soundtrack. However, in Battlefield Earth the sound is bascially just noise throughout the whole film. It is just embarrassing and stunningly awful in every way.\n\nIf you are a smart person, you will not watch Battlefield Earth. It is the worst sci-fi flick I have ever witnessed. It is bad in every aspect. There is not one good or decent thing in this movie. Not even Forest Whitaker can't save this movie. Avoid this film and watch a better sci-fi flick like The Matrix (which it copies because of the slow motion) or Star Wars.",

It i used at the most insignificant moments. Slow motion is best used sparingly anyway but I couldn't get past the idea that this film may have been 10 minutes shorter had the scenes in question been run at the correct frame rate. The dialogue is woeful but in a way the delivery, particularly from Travolta, is one of the few redeeming features. Whether it is supposed to be funny is up for debate but I did chuckle a few times.

I read about this film in a TV Guide listing films that would be playing on TV when I was a kid. I gotta tell you, this film is horrible, it's a waste of time (laughs). Ironically, I don't regret renting this film. I rented it out of curiosity to see how bad it was and people were right. Here are the complaints I have about this film, poor storyline, bad acting (especially from John Travolta), weak dialogue, everything from a thousand years prior still works, overuse of Dutch angles (45 degree angles on film cameras), and it's just a bad film. If you'd like to see a good science fiction film, check out \"Close Encounters Of The Third Kind\", \"ET\", \"The Thing\", or the \"Back To The Future\" franchise, the \"Terminator\" films (earlier, although I didn't see them, I hear they're good), \"Scooby Doo And The Alien Invaders\", \"Marvin The Martian cartoons\", or the episode of \"Scooby Doo\" (original series) where Scooby and the gang encounter an alien, all of which are better than this hunk of garbage. Also, this film is supposed to revolved around Scientology (which I do not believe in, but Travolta believes in), but I didn't see ANY connection between Scientology. All I saw was just messed up looking outfits and dumb aliens! But, I have to admit there were some scenes that were entertaining, but for the most part it was DUMB!",

Hello! Who built all those cities you destroyed? Considering all the evidence to the contrary, why do the supposedly intelligent Psyclos think human beings can't be taught how to mine gold? The very thought of humans operating mining equipment is prosperous to them, so why round them up? Certainly looks like they're put to work, and using basic tools too - and the work they're doing involves moving large quantities of rock, which is mining, right?\n\nHow is it possible that human beings with the mental capacity of prehistoric cave dwellers, can learn how to fly Harrier Jump Jets in less than a week? Then tell me how an alien species that can conquer the planet Earth in nine minutes, can't handle that same bunch of flying troglodytes in combat?\n\nWhy was most of the movie shot at a weird angle?\n\nA visiting Psychlo complains about Earth's gravity as being 'different'. Since we're to understand this race makes frequent visits to other planets, why haven't they gotten used to the concept that planets with a different mass will have a different gravitational force?\n\nDespite living on Earth for a thousand years, and actually capturing and feeding humans daily. Psyclos have no clue what humans like to eat.\n\nWhat bet did Forest Whitaker lose that resulted in his appearance in this film?\n\nDid anyone involved in the production of this horrible film actually read the source material? Because the book is actually very good.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThis is considered one of the worst movies ever made, and for good reason. Only cat killing levels of curiosity (or being a movie blogger :-) ) would compel someone to watch it. It's an illogical mess, and nothing at all like the book it's based on.\n\nBest Format:\n\nIf you are going to watch this, then a regular DVD or streaming show on any device you like will do.\n\nBest Element:\n\nJohn Travolta. Despite how bad this movie was, I have to respect John Travolta's obvious enthusiasm for this project. Even spending millions of his own money to help get it made. Maybe one day this story will get another chance on the big screen - because I'm telling you, if they had been more faithful to the book, Battlefied Earth could have been really special.\n\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/battlefield-earth-2000/\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

The uncreative names given to the Aliens \"the Psyclos\" are always shot on an angle and look visually stupid and ugly, they all have dreadlocks.  The movie should be called \"The laughing Aliens on Earth\" since they laugh at nearly every scene!  Overall the movie is poorly shot, poorly written and don't even get me started on the acting.

Everything about it just feels wrong and disjointed, in every possible way. From the overuse AND unnecessary use of dutch angles to John Travolta's laughingly-bad performance to Barry Pepper's grunting and groaning - it's all terrible, but it's all entertaining in a so bad that it's good kind of way. It's no wonder that the crew from Rifftrax riffed on this one. It certainly deserves their kind of treatment. I'd say that I'd watch this again, if only for the entertainment value I get out of it, but I have to rate it accordingly.

A real embarrassment for all involved, it's  a travesty and a curiosity.  A Scientology love letter to L.

Oh boy how I have dreaded this day...FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's my review of Battlefield Earth... just kidding, but seriously though it is god awful. \r\nThis big-budget (Piece of shit/ clusterfuck) science fiction adventure centers on a final battle between good and evil for control of the world. In the year 3000, Earth is ruled by the Psyclos, a vicious alien race of which Terl (John Travolta) is a member, that has laid waste to the planet, killed the majority of the population, and stripped Earth of its valuable resources (And camera stands apparently. Seriously, every shot is at a goddamn angle). Pockets of resistance remain among the surviving humans; Jonnie \"Goodboy\" Tyler (Barry Pepper) is one such rebel, living in hiding in the mountains near Boulder, CO. Eventually, Johnny begins organizing like-minded humans for a final stand against the Psyclos (When he discovers their weakness which is the stupidest fucking twist ever in the history of sci-fi!). The film is based on the novel by L. Ron Hubbard, the science fiction author also known as the founder of the Church of Scientology; it covers only the first half of the book, saving the remainder for a possible sequel (That better not happen or else I will riot.). Battlefield Earth also stars Forest (What the fuck am I doing here) Whitaker, Kim Coates, and Kelly Preston. ~( Mark Deming, Rovi)\r\nAs you can tell I am not exactly a fan of this bullshit, it makes me angry. Why, you ask. I'll tell you. The script is the biggest fucking mess I have ever witnessed. It contains horrible main characters, dialogue that is so bad it will make your ears bleed, and some of the worst villains in cinematic history. \r\nThe acting is worse than that featured in Troll 2. I am dead serious. No one here emerges unscathed, especially John Travolta who turns in the worst performance of his career. This is the type of acting that will be shown at film school with a big sign above it saying \"WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T DO THIS\". The main character and his girlfriend... I don't want to see them in a film ever again. Exile them from Hollywood if you must. \r\nThis movie had a budget of 30 million dollars. Looking at the film, I'm going to call bullshit on that. I think it cost 1 million MAX! These are the worst special effects in cinematic history, they don't even fucking try with this. The explosions, the enviroments, the ship designs, all of it is god awful. It fascinates me that this got through post-production. \r\nNow you know I hate this movie. But the funny thing is the people involved in it actually defended it after it released. So here is what I'm gonna do. I will list what these people said in their defense, and I'm going to make them look like goddamn idiots. Okay? Here we go. \r\n \"When I felt better about everything was when George Lucas and Quentin Tarantino, and a lot of people that I felt knew what they were doing, saw it and thought it was a great piece of science fiction.\"- John Travolta That is highly unlikely. They probably did it for one of two reasons: 1.They didn't want to hurt your feelings or 2. They were drunk or high as hell. \r\n\"[The] critics were waiting for us to ... chop our heads off. Everybody hated Scientology for some reason. I didn't know people were so prejudiced.\" He argued that despite the film's poor performance it would cover its costs in due course: \"Maybe [in] the second cycle with Internet, and HBO, and DVD, you always make your money ... so I'm not going to lose sleep over one movie that did not perform for us.\"- Elie Samaha\r\nThis has been a hot topic lately, with Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer saying the critics \"Conspired\" against the movie. That is not true. The critics didn't hate your movies cause they don't like its production history or because you guys are scientologist, that is simply untrue. She is just trying to expain away her pathetic failures, and doing a bad job at that. \r\nAnd the best part: They were originally going to make a trilogy out of this. I shit you not.Two sequels to the worst movie ever made ? Yeah... no. Don't believe me saying how bad this is, lets see what the critics had to say. \r\n\"With this kind of epic ineptitude -- hell, the flick is set in the year 3000 -- you go for \"worst of the millennium.\"\"-Peter Travers (Rolling Stone)\r\n\"One of the darkest, ugliest, most uninvolving and incomprehensible major-studio fantasies I've ever seen.\"-Jack Mathews (New York Daily News)\r\n\"Here is a picture that will be hailed without controversy as the worst of its kind ever made. It could be renamed Ed Wood's Planet of the Apes if that title didn't promise more cheesy fun than the movie actually delivers.\" -David Edelstein (Slate)\r\nSo yeah... stay far away from this movie.

They are cinematic abortions, enormous bird shits on the windshield of film, the anus of everything good. They make you realize that human beings are capable of unspeakable acts of cruelty and stupidity. And this is very much the case with Battlefield Earth. Starring John Travolta as Terl of Psyclo (or WHATEVER THE FUCK, I'm not wasting more of my time to look it up), an alien being who has helped enslave all of mankind. They refer to humans as 'man-animals', which (for you fellow Trollfighters out there) is the name given to us by one of our greatest adversaries. \r\n\r\nWords cannot describe the experience one feels while viewing this 'movie'. It's an abomination. The film that should not have been. It may have usurped Tim and Eric's Billion-Dollar Movie and taken its rightful place as the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm going to try as hard as I can to give this enormous piece of elephant shit an honest and professional review without going fucking nuts over how bad it is. So, let's begin.\r\n\r\nThe main problem with this travesty is that it's just very, very boring. Even in the scenes that are supposed to be 'action-packed', 'intense', or even 'watchable', there is absolutely no sense of suspense or excitement while watching any scene of this enormous tumor upon cinema. For those of you who want to get an idea of it, I refer you to the Hose Scene video on YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZujb23cwX0\r\n\r\nYou would think that someone who has, in the past, starred as Vince Vega in Pulp Fiction and Chili Palmer in Get Shorty would have a bit more acting clout than to participate in this cinematic pustule. But unfortunately, John Travolta's faith in Scientology clouded his judgement, and he took it upon himself to act in this movie based on Scientology's beliefs. This might be the biggest career blunder of all time-- Travolta hasn't gotten much work since when this tremendous pile of crap was made back in 2000. Nearly all his movies since then have gotten 'splats', except for animated features and documentaries in which he plays himself.\r\n\r\nBut now, I have to say this: To those of you who want to see Battlefield Earth just to say you've seen it, DON'T. Yesterday, I was just like you. I thought that watching this movie would be a fun exercise in laughing at bad movies. I was so, so wrong. It's not even entertaining for that. It has no value in this world whatsoever. Just go out and do something with your life. Final Score for Battlefield Earth: 0/10 stars. I only gave it 1 here because RT won't let you give a movie a zero rating. Just a horrible, horrible movie. Stay the fuck away.",

            "content": "Now this film wanted to be epic, it really tried, Travolta put millions of his own fortune into it and pushed people into helping him create it. These type of catastrophic alien invasion films were all the rage around this time after the success of 'Independence Day'. The films title alone sounds epic, a thundering statement...BATTLEFIELD EARTH!, it sounds like the ultimate sci-fi action film, so what's wrong with it?.\n\nFirst and foremost it looks like, and for all intense and purposes, is an extended 'Star Trek' episode. The plot is very dull and plays out like a dull episode of Star Trek, one involving lots of dialog about mining for minerals (gold, for what reason? I dunno), slave trading and general alien politics. The mistake made with the alien race (with the rather stupid name of 'Psychlos', is that the best Hubbard could come up with??) in this film is that they are dissected too much. We hear about all sorts of trivial background stuff that isn't required, in the end they just seem like large humans, there is no mystery.\n\nOn top of the really overly laboured plot is the simple fact that these aliens look crap. Putting aside the obvious 'Klingon' like appearance, they look like huge platform wearing transvestites with dreadlock-like hair in campy goth space suits. As if they belong in some fetish club or one of those freaky bizarre goth circus's.\n\nThen there's the simple question of why Travolta's face isn't the same as the rest of the alien race? why do all of them have devil/vampire-like faces but Travolta's is normal?. Is this because Travolta didn't wanna be hidden behind makeup?. Who's decision was it to let Travolta have/keep his little goatee? that kinda detracts from the whole alien design don't you think, a humanoid goatee. And who are these really old looking alien politicians with the flabby necks? is that what 'Psychlos' look like with age? why don't they look like the other 'Psychlos' facially?.\n\nOther minor issues spring to mind also such as the fact these guys don't feel pain, Travolta's arm gets blown off yet it doesn't really faze him. Whitaker seems to be the only black alien in the entire race. Then there's the amusing observation that most of the cast clearly can't walk too well in the stilts they are on, no running by these aliens hehe.\n\nThen we have the human element, or what's left of them. OK so humans are almost extinct and the 'Psychlos' have been ruling them for 1000 years apparently. So why has humankind completely forgotten everything about their past? the ability to use their brains, know what basic objects like glass or weapons are, names of places etc...they have forgotten everything which makes no sense. Mankind has been enslaved by aliens but why have they gone backwards to primitive cavemen? they don't know what a city is or what stars in the sky are, they worships Gods like ancient humans once did and they all scream and yelp like monkeys. But they still wear trousers.\n\nThe plot totally loses it once the rebellion begins, the last humans led by Pepper conveniently find apparent secret military bases still stocked to the gills with weapons, Harrier jets and power it seems. Little bit of training and many of them are now proficient in guns and even better...can fly Harrier Jump jets no probs!! just like that. So much so that they are able to engage alien ships in a fancy ass dogfight.\n\nThere really are so many plot holes and question marks I can't possibly mention them all or remember them all!. I do recall the effects being somewhat bigged up at the time, they were suppose to be pretty neat for the day. I guess they aren't too bad to be honest, some shots look nice, mainly ruined cityscape's, the alien ships are a reasonable design as is some of the ship flight sequences. Sets are pretty bland and uninspired, just faceless metallic facilities whilst the whole film has this quite ugly blue/grey/green tint/hue to it which is unusual.\n\nSo for a film called 'battlefield earth' there actually isn't that much in the realms of mega earthbound conflicts going on, its all based in one location. On a certain silly level the film can be enjoyable with its action sequences, it totally jumps on the 'Independence Day' bandwagon that's for sure, but it can still be minor fun.\n\nHad this been a few half hour episodes of a TV sci-fi series then it could be looked on more favourably. I mean the film really isn't much better than a TV show, but I must admit to liking Travolta's wickedly evil campy performance. That and the 'Psychlos' females that we get a glimpse of, a kind of fetish wearing gothic 'Cenobite' with very very long tongues, film highlight for me.",

            "content": "Considered one of the worst movies ever made and based on the laughably mediocre novel of the same name, Battlefield Earth sounded like a masterpiece of terrible filmmaking.\n\nAs with any adaptation, Battlefield Earth takes man liberties with its source material. Battlefield Earth only adapts the first half of L. Ron Hubbard's 1050 page novel. On the surface that sounds like a perfectly reasonable idea as that is the better part of the story. I enjoyed the first third of the novel because of how it characterized the relationship between Jonnie Goodboy Tyler and Terl, even if the writing style was very juvenile. Unfortunately, the few plot points and general concepts that I enjoyed from the original are abandoned in the process of adaptation.\nThe first scene to really focus on is the first violent encounter between Jonne Goodboy Tyler and Terl. As much as I found that L. Ron Hubbard could not write good action scenes at all, I felt that the scene where Jonnie Goodbye Tyler faces off with Terl for the first time was one of the better plot points. It was described as a largely western showdown, a battle between advanced weaponry and a kill club. After facing the adaptation process of Corey Mandell and J.D. Shapiro, the entire scene is changed. It ends up sacrificing any sense of competence for an abundance of slow motion sequences plagued by an excess of green filtering in which Jonnie runs through a derelict shopping center with no sounds to be heard and poorly rendered stun lasers being shot at him. He collapses, and then audiences have to bear witness to Roger Christian's idea of the species known as Psychlos.\nThough a species of aliens named clearly for L. Ron Hubbard to have an excuse to reference psychology as evil in his eyes do not have a high standard of intrinsic character value, the film adaptation manages to mess up everything in attempting to characterize them. For one thing, The Psychlos speak English way too much in the film when their own language was what separated them from the \"man animals\" who they viewed as their inferior. Unfortunately, it just adds to the artificiality of Battlefield Earth as the Psychlos are already too obviously human beings in costumes which dream of reaching the standard of half-assed. The exact quote that characterizes the design of the Psychlos is as follows: \"Either or nine feet tall, maybe more. About three and a half feet wide. Two arms. Two legs.\" These basic elements are captured by the actors, but the elements requiring prosthetic effects is the \"Shiny substance fort a face and a long tube from the chin down to the chest. Glowing amber eyes behind the shiny front plate.\" are completely ignored. The \"Furry paws and long talons\" are some of the most iconic beast aspects of the species, but they are overly simplistic in design. Lastly, it is said that their \"Huge booted feet dented the earth\" and are guessed to weigh \"a thousand pounds\" in an attempt to make them seem threatening. Yet the creatures do not look intimidating at all and fail to fit the description of L. Ron Hubbard's source novel at all. As it is, antagonist Terl looks like the result of John Romero having an allergic reaction to a bee sting and walking around in a state of life support. Their appearance is dreadful, and the female Psychlos look even worse, although they only appear briefly in the film. Still, it remains notable enough for its incompetence.\nOddly enough, the ridiculous design for the Psychlos is not the worst visual aspect of Battlefield Earth. In actual fact, that is the cinematography. If you don't know what a dutch angle is, a few minutes of any scene in Battlefield Earth will have you knowing.\nThe dutch tilt is a technique used to create a sense of uneasiness in the more dramatic moments of any film. Apparently, that is every second in Battlefield Earth as there is more dutch angles than terrible acting which is a pretty large call. There is no sense in taking the story the slightest bit seriously because everything is too dutch for its own good. And at the end of the long scenes are the same basic transition every time. Every. Time. It's the same basic horizontal wipe which goes from the center of the screen in both directions at once, the kind of cheap editing technique used by fifth grade students discovering Windows Movie Maker for the first time. For a commercial film to use it so much without even a second guess is just purely ridiculous, but after sitting through so much slow motion, dutch angles and poor lighting.\nThough the incompetent story and terrible technical elements are separate issues, they merge into the narrative that is Battlefield Earth and end up creating countless scenes which are far beyond ridiculous. The best scene in the film comes from when Terl is told by Zete that his period of time on earth will be extended by another \"fifty cycles\". The line \"With endless options for renewal\" echoes multiple times while the strange creatures laugh in a haze of slow motion and excess of blue filtering. This scene is hilariously terrible, reminding me heavily of the famous scene from the episode of The Simpsons \"Last Exit to Springfield\" in which the words \"Dental Plan\" and \"Lisa Needs Braces\" echo in Homer Simpson's head repeatedly as he tries to grasp his train of thought before it derails. Because of that, the scene is the epitome of all the unintentional humour in the film where the scale is limited solely to the discussion between characters where the incompetent attempt at \"spectacle\" cannot serve as any kind of distraction.\nThe pacing of the story is poor. It's clear that there is a lot of narrative ground to cover in the film and that a commercial film adaptation of such ridiculous source material would ignore many extensive periods of dialogue, melodramatic subplots and plot points that expands upon the technological nature of the universe in favour of a progressing narrative. Unfortunately, the film just speeds right past the idea of characterization with a painful bluntness. The characters weren't that deep, but the relationship between Jonnie Goodboy Tyler and Terl is what interested me about the novel. Unfortunately, that is completely forgotten about as are many other story elements. The novel explains that humans are needed to mine Earth's gold as machinery is too difficult to maintain and the compound that Psychlos breath known as \"breathe-gas\" is explosive if it comes into contact with uranium which is said to plagued the mountains. In the film, there is no mention of this. Considering that the presence of uranium as a key asset to the leverage humans hold over psychlos with leverage being a word used repeatedly in the film to follow on with the novel. That just goes to show that the film knows the word is relevant to the story, but it just doesn't know why. And at the same time, it doesn't know why the original novel was titled \"Battlefield Earth\".\nEven though the film takes the title of Battlefield Earth, the global intergalactic war with Psychlo is never touched upon. The large scale action scenes described poorly in the novel which could have been much better as part of a bigger cinematic spectacle are completely omitted from the film adaptation, not only is that unfaithful, but it renders the title of the text misleading. Essentially, Battlefield Earth is not only an incompetent and misguided film, but it is a large betrayal to its sub-par source material and therefore lowers the already esoteric audience likely to enjoy the film to be only the least demanding fans of L. Ron Hubbard's works.\nStill, the film is a brilliant comedy.\nThere is hilarious irony in the production as the message in the film is that education is the greatest foe of any oppressor, yet it is only the truly educated people who can clearly see L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology legacy is little more than a threatening farce. The film almost goes against what Scientology is built on, only retaining the concepts of a ridiculous story and absolute idiocy to appeal to the cult. Yet the funniest irony in the film is that Battlefield Earth has a plot point regarding Terl discovering Zete has been defrauding his company so he can embezzle funds, while Franchise Pictures was sued for defrauding its investors through overstating the production budget of Battlefield Earth. Considering that the film looks so freaking cheap, it is difficult to believe that it actually cost the proclaimed $73 million. That one criminal act proves that the film is pure evil in every way, a more convincing evil than John Travolta's attempt to characterize antagonist Terl through one of his most enjoyable performances to date.\nJohn Travolta's performance is quite remarkable. I mean, it is so pathetically unconvincing that it is genuinely hilarious. Decked out in a ridiculous costume, John Travolta looks and acts like he is on a poorly lit episode of H.R. Pufnstuf. His campy acting and inability to stop smiling reinforces the idea that he thinks he is in a comedy, and his emotionless attempts to be intimidating are some of the most pathetically hilarious scenes of his career. And yet, when he pretends to be angry it is even funnier. Watching him aggressively trying to stuff a rat in the mouth of Barry Pepper and shouting \"Do you want lunch?!?\" is now an image of him which I will never forget and one of my favourite moments in the film. Clearly surrounded by endless weak material, John Travolta embraces his fate and actively transcends the film by going beyond the standard of bad depicted by the other cast members. While the other actors deliver uninvolved performances, John Travolta is deluded into thinking that he can honestly make something good out of the role by putting a tenacious effort into it. His dedication is too much for a character that is so misguided and ridiculous, and so his repetitive line delivery and blank facial expressions prove hilarious. John Travolta's terrible performance is the greatest and most entertaining asset to Battlefield Earth because it is so ridiculous and far from the character described in the source material that it proves the film was worthy of an adaptation just to bring out the worst in him. Of all the actors to ever win the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor, John Travolta is one of the most deserving as his effort truly deserves plenty of recognition. He doesn't save the film, he makes it worse in the best possible way.\nBerry Pepper is an actor I have long admired for his strong supporting performances in films such as Saving Private Ryan or The Green Mile. I can still admire those efforts after seeing Battlefield Earth, but I must confront the notion that he is no leading man. When Barry Pepper runs, he could not thrust his arms any more than he physically does. He looks like an extra from Highlander but moves like Charlie Chaplin having an epileptic fit. So on a physical level, he is a hilarious presence. But when it comes down to actually being involved in the character, Barry Pepper cannot do any transcending. In the source novel, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler was a thinly scripted and generic protagonist with a mild sense of patriotism for fighting for humanity, so in that sense Barry Pepper delivers what is written. Unfortunately, he is given the appearance of more of a mystical fantasy film hero than the bearded muscular man characterized in the original text. The man doesn't look right for the part so he is miscast, and his uninvolved performance doesn't damage his credibility so much as it just serves as a reminder for how poor the characterization in the film is. Barry Pepper does not shine this time around.\nEven Forest Whitaker managed to weasel his way into the cast somehow. Forest Whitaker went on to win an Academy Award for Best Actor six years after Battlefield Earth, so it is good that he got a sense of mediocre acting out of him early on. Although he did just appear in the dreadful Taken 3, the man has talent. Battlefield Earth fails to anything with it though. Seemingly just following the crowd, Forest Whitaker delivers a monotonous performance as he forces all the terrible dialogue through the veil of his ridiculous costume. However, he is one of the legitimately better members of the cast. He has noting to boast about, but the standard of acting around him is below what he delivers. Though his character Ker is meant to be a \"midget Psychlo\", this factor does not carry over into the film. But Forest Whitaker manages to move the character in line with the monotonous and uninvolved characters of the same species all around him by remaining singular with his tone of voice. But unlike John Travolta or Michael MacRae, Forest Whitaker's tone of voice is naturally a very deep one which makes his line delivery come off as slightly more organic. As a result, the dark Psychlo nature of the character us slightly more believable. I can't see Forest Whitaker's wanting to put this film on his resume any time soon, but it is clear that he has more credibility as Ker than any cast member in the film.\nAnd I don't know what direction Kelly Preston was going in with her brief and somewhat disturbing cameo, but the ideal direction for her would be anywhere else. Preferably away from the screen.\nIt's also a shame that Richard Tyson was a wasted presence because I just saw him in Three O'Clock High recently and enjoyed his effort.\n\nSo Battlefield Earth is a double entendre of terrible filmmaking as it disregards anything slightly positive from its sub-par source material while maintaining the incompetence of L. Ron Hubbard's writing style, matching it with the same standard of craft in Roger Christian's directorial work with a shoddily constructed narrative plagued by poor acting, weak scripting and an excess of poorly lit filtering, rough slow motion and inexplicable Dutch angles. But the fact that such a level of incongruence exists in a Hollywood film alongside a hilariously awful performance from John Travolta ensures that there is plenty of room for the film to exist as a guilty pleasure on midnight film circuits.",

Being a huge science fiction enthusiast  I enjoy about pretty much anything sci-fi thrown at me. Is it the worst movie ever made? That's a big no. There are much worse films than this. For example: Troll 2 and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. There's no expectations when you first see it, unless you read the book. But, very seldom teenage and younger adults have, so the only thing that leaves you mad and dissapointed is that it is in itself a bad film.",

I knew nothing about the movie so I rented it and here's what I have to say: ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?! How was this movie allowed to be made? Who thought this would work? What parts of the movie make sense? The plot is simple and stupid; it's in the year 3000 and a weird race or something called the \"Psyclos\" are ruling the Earth and this group of humans has to stop them. The leader of the psyclos is named Terl and he's played by John Travolta. Why would you cast him? His only good role was in Pulp Fiction. His performance in this shows why he'll never be taken seriously as an actor ever again. His line reading is hammy and he's the definition of over-the-top. Another actor is Barry Pepper and he's mostly known for his role as the sniper in Saving Private Ryan. If only he could've brought that role on the set of Battlefield Earth and sniped the director. A really odd thing about the movie are the weird camera angles. All the angles are tilted so that whatever is on screen is close to being exactly diagonal. It's mind-numbing and it gets old really quick. The special effects are awful. They made me feel like I was watching a campy, public domain action movie.The editing also doesn't help for the \"action\" scenes. It's just all over the place. One example is when (Spoiler alert, though I'm pretty sure you've lost you're ability to give a shit with this movie.) Terl gets his arm blown off. The guy blasts it, his arm is on screen for barely a second and that's it. I didn't even know what had happened until I saw Terl with a missing arm in the end scene. Oh and the \"clever\" irony of the last scene involving a bunch of gold is enough to make anyone groan or make a sarcastic remark. (You don't say?!) Avoid this movie by all means. It's an hour and forty-five minutes that will just drag on and on. The worst part is you probably won't be able to get it back.",

The humans are enslaved and forced to work for them. Any that weren't lived in isolated areas beyond their control. One such human, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper), leaves his village. However, he gets captured. Terl (John Travolta), the alien leader of those on the Earth, is forced to stay forever on Earth because of a certain crime he committed in the past. But he soon comes up with a plan to have the people mine gold in order to buy his way off the planet. Jonnie discovers more about the Psychlos and must lead humanity in a battle to take back their freedom.\r\n\r\nThis isn't one of these \"it's so bad, it's good\" movies. This is one of these movies that is bad beyond bad. There are no interesting characters. The special effects are bad and the action lacks excitement. The plot is also so bland that it makes The Phantom Menace look like The Empire Strikes Back.\r\n\r\nThe acting is just as bad. John Travolta is the worst of the lot. His character was whiny and doesn't even act like a bad guy. The rest of the cast is just as lifeless.\r\n\r\nThere are only two possible reasons to even consider watching this movie at all. 1.)To see if it's as bad as people says it is (which is the category I fall into) or 2.)if you're one of the few who actually like this movie.\r\n\r\nAlthough not the worst movie I've seen, it's certainly the worst sci-fi movie.",

            "content": "When I was twelve, I remember walking into my local video store where I went to rent movies all of the time.  I saw a poster for Battlefield Earth displayed and I thought that it looked good.  I don't remember if this was before, or after I went to the theaters to see Star Wars Episode II, but I digress.  Nonetheless, this film caught my interest.  I remember my dad came home one day with the movie and I watched it and it was a slap in the face.\n\nThe plot takes place in the year 3000.  The primitive mankind has been enslaved by an alien race from the planet Psychlo.  The Earth has been drained of almost all of its natural resources and mankind is forced into hiding.  Amongst the humans is a man named Johnny Goodboy Tyler (played by Berry Pepper) who gets captured while touring the ruins with two men from a different colony who show him various statues that they confuse for gods.  While he is captured, he discovers who these ''demons'' (the humans in the colonies call them such due to their ignorance) are.  One of which, named Terl (played by John Travolta) is the chief head of security who is accompanied by Ker (played by Forest Whitaker).  In response to his authorities putting him back on Earth, the planet he despises, he and Kerr begin to privately train the humans to harvest gold so they can keep it for themselves.  As they learn more about one another, Johnny starts to organize the surviving colonies into a resistance faction to overthrow the Psychlos and liberate Earth.\n\nThis movie is based on a book written by L. Ron Hubbard in 1982.  L. Ron Hubbard is infamous for founding the Church of Scientology, but this movie has absolutely nothing to do with Scientology.  There is so much wrong with this disaster of a sci-fi movie, I don't know where to begin.  We'll begin with the structuring.\n\nThis movie's plot covers the first 436 pages of the book's 1050 page length, but the adaptation is very dreadful.  The first couple of seconds into the film begins with a overhead view of the humans going inside their place of sanctuary.  We finally see Johnny return from lord knows where with a cure for his father only to find out he's dead.  Johnny then begins to mourn.  Why am I bringing this up?  Because unlike the book, we don't get any exposure, nor backstory to that character whatsoever.  Granted, there have been films that have started out that way.  Two of which being Fantastic Planet (Terr's mother getting killed by the playing Tragg) and Dragonball Z: The History of Trunks (Gohan returning with a cure, only to find out that his dad, Goku has passed away), but in this film it's executed miserably.  It's paced at the last minute, it's rushed, and comes totally unexpected.\n\nOh, wait.  There's more.  Another thing one will notice with only a few minutes exposure is that almost every shot is slanted.  I don't know whose bright idea that was, but I can safely say that it's stupid.  There's no plot device to hold this dynamic in place and it never contributes to anything in the long run.  When I first saw this movie, I remember that it was very hard to tell what was going on in the images because of this fact.  There were also times where I had to tilt my head at the corresponding angle just to watch the film.  I can safely say that there's no excuse whatsoever for this.  This is only one of the things this film is notorious for. \n\nAnother thing that brings this film down are the special effects.  The special effects look very drab, dark, and generic.  Most of them look like images one would expect off of an Atari game.  The sound effects to these same images sound like someone took each and every sound effect from tons of video games and compressed them wrong.  The music doesn't fare much better.  Roger Ebert perfectly summed up in his review that the music sounds like someone threw an activated microphone into a trash can and rambunctiously tossed it to and fro.\n\nThe designs of the aliens are another noteworthy thing.  In the book, the Psychlos were described as humaniod felines that stood at ten feet.  In this movie they all wear KISS boots and Bob Marley wigs.  Their air masks are reduced to oxygen tubes that hang from their noses like snot from someone who has a really bad cold.  Their fangs are replaced with rotten, yellow teeth that could use some serious dental care.  Their talons are also nothing but three-fingered hands that have infected nails that could use some serous trimming.  I know that aliens (mostly evil ones) are supposed to be ugly, but with this movie's theme being about understanding one another and being liberated it all feels so needless.  The story just isn't dramatic and the tension is totally absent.  This fact alone makes it jarring.\n\nAnother thing noteworthy is the idiocy of this film's plot.  Examples being: Terl is a leader of a conquering race.  This race has enslaved humanity for many years and they don't know anything about humans.  What we eat, how we live, nor our language.  When Johnny holds Terl at gunpoint and stops the accompanying humans from killing him, he gives Terl back his gun after giving a motivational speech to the humans and doesn't kill him.  As Terl teaches the humans how to use their war technology and leaves for the day, I'm not lying this is true, he watches the humans by having a small camera fly over every couple of hours and take a still picture.  The humans destroy the planet Psychlo with a single nuclear bomb and this happens because the atmosphere is radioactive. \n\nTerl is just a complete buffoon in this movie who does nothing but call Johnny rat-brain (like he does in the book, but in the book he's smarter), gets drunk off of kerbango, gawks with Chirk-his secretary played by Kelly Preston, and scowls at everybody he talks to.  As with all of the other Psychlos.  Some of y'all might be wondering whether I've read the book.  And the answer is: yes I have.  Terl did all of these things that I've just mentioned, but the way the movie ''simplifies\" them is remarkably dumb.  Johnny was the only human present with the Psychlos.  Terl captures him by himself and begins to study him first thing.  Terl didn't get knocked down by a human while showing off his marksmanship skills, he got attacked by a bear and Johnny saved him with Terl's own gun.  The cameras that monitored the miners were always on, but moved in specific patterns that became known and evaded by the human miners.  During his imprisonment, Johnny develops a friendship with Ker- the midget Psychlo who accompanied Terl, but never was involved in Terl's plot to plunder the gold for himself.  Terl never lost his arm.  Lastly, the planet was not destroyed in the middle of the book, it was near the end.  The planet was not destroyed by one nuclear bomb, it was destroyed by a multitude of them that reached its core and turned it into a radioactive sun.\n\nOverall, Battlefield Earth is a disaster of a film from start to finish.  While it does retain some of the character traits that were presented in the book, the way it executes them is just miserable.  I give this movie 1 star because the dialogue is halfway decent and does contain some memorable lines here and there.  The cast of actors in this film are great, but not here in this movie.  If you want great alien films, check out Predator, Alien, Aliens, Predators, Starship Troopers, and Avatar.  Otherwise, either read the book this film is based on, which is a good read.  But stay away from this film.",

It may very well be one of the 10 worst movies of all time.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is pretty much the worst script I've ever heard. Seriously, ever. Even the memorable quotes were lame. It was like a 3rd grader was writing the script for a fantasy sci-fi movie he was writing for his buddies.\r\n\r\nAlso, the movie is infamous for it's bad acting. And the pinnacle of all that bad acting has got to be Barry Pepper as Jonnie Tyler, leader of the human resistance. When he is not viciously overacting he is underacting, and his character comes across as INCREDIBLY annoying. John Travolta wasn't very good either, but he did a better job than most of the other cast.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the lighting is horrible. It's dark when it's supposed to be light and light when it's supposed to be dark. It's all one giant mess. I felt like I was watching a home movie made by two Star Trek nerds.\r\n\r\nThe sound was really messed up too. You remember how revolutionary the sound affects in Star Wars were? That would be the opposite of \"Battlefield Earth\". There are plenty of awkward silent sequences and even more awkward laser sounds.\r\n\r\nYou know, there are some movies that make me want to yell at every one who can possibly enjoy them.

Don't get me wrong, it's really fucking bad in virtually every department (I do like the music, though), but it's badness is a thing of beauty, of unintentional comedy joy, and unintentional surrealism and absurdity. I've watched this film multiple times over the years, even inflicting it on friends and family who are willing enough to sit through it. The plot holes are big enough to create another ring around Saturn (How are jet fighters still flyable after 1,000 years? How can cavemen learn to fly said jet fighters in like, two weeks?), the acting is legendarily bad (John Travolta as Terl is the equivalent of an overwrought, badly directed Shakespearean role), the special effects are awful/fascinating in a fever dream kind of way, it shamelessly rips off other sci-fi films and franchises (Star Wars, Star Trek, Planet of the Apes, Blade Runner, etc), and every moment of watching it is awe-inspiring in its ineptitude. Then again, should I expect differently from a film John Travolta pitched as, \"It's Star Wars meets Pulp Fiction, but better\" and the fact that the novel it's based on was written by the founder of Scientology? It's a glorious, legendary, hilariously awful mess of a film that will be forever mocked. And because of all these facts, I will treasure this film, enjoy it, and watch it many more times over the years. Unless you have a strong stomach for garbage, I don't recommend it.

The movie was one of those 'so bad it is funny' ones but even the pathetic and unintentional comedy couldn't keep my attention very well. I did laugh hard that every time the aliens got upset they said 'crap' or in John Travolta's case 'crap lousy'. As the plot moved forward it also moved into water too deep to rescue it. Basically the aliens defeated all of modern earth in 9 minutes so the humans that are not captured are pretty much cave men technologically. One guy gets I guess all the information ever just shot into his eyes so he knows basically everything the aliens do and hatches the most outlandish plan ever. Since modern earth didn't have a chance he somehow gets the idea his cavemen buddies can help him not only get the aliens off his planet but also destroy the entire planet the aliens come from. No big deal, just throw some nukes through a teleporter to blow up the alien world (actually the most plausible part of the idea) and also launch an assault on the earth base by getting a simulator to train the cavemen to pilot Harrier jets into combat. Oh and this all must be prepared within one week. Did I mention all the explosives they want to lay around the base that somehow won't be immediately detected by cameras or security guards?\nThis film is grade A garbage. If Sci Fi channel were ever to get a budget big enough to put one of it's originals onto the big screen, this is what would happen. To use Travolta's phrase, this movie was 'crap lousy'.",

In the year 3000, Earth is ruled by the Psyclos, a vicious alien race of which Terl (John Travolta) is a member, that has laid waste to the planet, killed the majority of the population, and stripped Earth of its valuable resources. Pockets of resistance remain among the surviving humans; Jonnie \"Goodboy\" Tyler (Barry Pepper) is one such rebel, living in hiding in the mountains near Boulder, CO. Eventually, Johnny begins organizing like-minded humans for a final stand against the Psyclos. The film is based on the novel by L. Ron Hubbard, the science fiction author also known as the founder of the Church of Scientology; it covers only the first half of the book, saving the remainder for a possible sequel. Battlefield Earth also stars Forest Whitaker, Kim Coates, and Kelly Preston. \n\nDirected by Roger Christian.\n\nyes i have seen it ... and it is one of the worst movies ever ... i am shocked that these 2 actors did it.... and the costumes are scary hilarious. i don't wanna see it again for the review so i'll rate it.",

            "content": "I have a select few movies that I choose to give zero stars, and Battlefield Earth is not one of them. Barely. The reason I give this movie half a star is because of my curiosity. About 20 minutes in I was amazed at how bad it was, so my curiosity wanted to see just how repulsive this movie could get. That is the only front that Battlefield Earth succeeded on. It's incredible how misguided Battlefield Earth is from pointless camera shots, to terrible cinematography, an awful script, wooden acting and...well you get the point. I have seen how good movies can get, and now I know how bad it can get. Battlefield Earth puts everything horrendous that can happen in cinema and not only uses it, but puts it on a pedestal.\r\n\r\nWhere to begin? How about the wasted talent at hand. John Travolta has some serious talent. The sad thing is he was a big follower of scientology and encouraged this film to be made. Unfortunately, the book this is based off of by L. Ron Hubbard, got universal backlash. The film followed suit, minimizing all of the actors on screen to grunts and pointless dialogue. Forrest Whitaker (an Oscar winner!) is really put to shame here as a mere underling. Sometimes he's smart, sometimes he's stupid, its an inconsistent an poorly conceived sidekick to Terl. Barry Pepper as Johnny Goodboy Tyler (wow what a name) is the only person who even attempts some sort of intelligence in this waste heap. But Pepper, who gave the performance of his career in The 25th Hour, is forced to do nothing but yell, scream and say cliched lines. Hilariously, the actors are probably the most insignificant problem in this film, but they are still a big problem.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem here has to be director Roger Christian who ironically, to quote Roger Ebert, has made \"an unholy mess\". This has to be the most pretentious and grim direction I've seen in a film. Instead of focusing on the plot, which is completely incoherent, I was focusing on how many dutch angles we're in this film. I looked it up and apparently virtually all but a few frames of the film are in dutch angles. Why is the camera slanted? It has no purpose at all! And why when there is sun out does it look like someone urinated on the film strip? Can't we get a lighting technician somewhere? I'm ranting but this is a film that deserves to be ranted about because it is so easy to do so. Any aspect you can think of, this film does not do it well, or at all. \r\n\r\nAmazingly, Roger Christian came recommended from none other that George Lucas. See, Lucas isn't that amazing a director, he just happened to conceive the most famous science fiction saga in cinema. Roger Christian was the second unit director on The Phantom Menace, so of course Lucas would recommend him. He was a second unit director for a reason. Christian's vision of the year 3000 is so cheap looking, so dull and completely lifeless, and it reflects in the film. There is just no characters to root for, no luscious or interactive sets, or any intelligent ideas. It's a big wad of lifelessness that just sits there.\r\n\r\nI'm amazed that I even stayed awake for this. I was just staring at my laptop as meaningless images seemed to roll over it. I barely understood the plot, and nothing made any sense. I was convinced that this story was butchered. Somewhere on the cutting room floor, and inside the CGI editors room, there is a movie. Even though the acting is horrendous, this world could have looked beautiful. But it doesn't. It's a world I never want to visit again.\r\n\r\nEverything here just hits a dead end. No one can go anywhere without contrivances popping in left and right, the plot is silly, slow and stupid. The special effects are incredibly lame, remember this came out a year after The Matrix broke new ground with their conception of \"bullet time\". I had no time for this film, but it just kept topping itself with atrocity after contrivance after dullness after terrible witty remark. \r\n\r\nCan I emphasize anymore that nothing works? I guess giving this film a bad review is going with the crowd, but this crowd is the size of the critical and financial failure this film was: massive. Hey, maybe people will seek out this film because of all the negativity surrounding it. To those who do, I will forever be in envy of your perseverance and endurance. Battlefield Earth is awful, plain and simple.",

I didnt even know who was the pro and ant.\r\nI think the awful main char is Johnny or something. Well anyways I think the Earth has been invaded by some sort of alien creature who want gold? And um... Johnny for some unknown reason wants to go out and explore the world even though their are aliens everywhere. So um..... yea thats about it. For some reason the main alien guy played by an awful Travolta, wants Johnny, even though their are thousands of humans around. And the whole movie is basically Johnny somehow escaping from Travolta and then getting captured again. There is literally a scene in this movie where Jonnie just runs away, and nobody stops him? I mean... really! \r\n3 mins into the movie it had one somewhat normal scene of snowy mts. And then the 45 degree angle shots came into beign, and then the headaches began to occur. So picture upsidedown camera angles, mixed in with truly agonizingly bad acting, and unlbeliavbly corny lines of dailouge, and Boom! you have Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000!\r\nTo truly learn how awful this film is, you have to actually see it. It is just stupid.

His horse comes out of nowhere and he jumps on and flees.\r\nWTF!\r\nFinal Score... Negative 565665656565656/10",

Sure it plays like a cheap live action cartoon, but that turned out to be one of the reasons to why I liked it so much. From the cheap costumes, to the very laughable dialogue, I could see why not too many people liked this. It was apparently Travolta's idea to have this story of scientology adapted to the big screen, and having himself portray the lead bad guy. He wanted this to be the \"Star Wars\" of this generation, and while watching the film, you could tell that. You can take a film like \"Grease\" more serious than this. I guess there was going to be a sequal, but it was never made do to bad reviews, and very poor box office performance. But, just the same, I'd recommend this bad movie for anyone who gets enjoyment out of such cinematic cheese.",

At the time I thought, ?Travolta is in it, so it shouldn?t be bad?I?ll watch.? If only I had known better. But I feel I was taken advantage of, as were so many. Travolta?s bad acting in this movie nowhere near made up for this crap sandwich. I also didn?t know about the connection to Scientology when I watched it. Now that I do, I feel so sad for those poor misguided people, following a ?religion? that could contribute to the making of a movie this spectacularly horrendous. A movie with bad acting on a new low level, huge plot holes, and completely unbelievable scenarios throughout. But it?s good to know that if I?m ever in a post-apocalyptic world all I have to do is go to Fort Hood and I?ll find 1,000-year-old jet planes will be intact, with perfectly usable fuel, and that even though I?ve never even flown a plane before in my life I?ll be able to pick that up with ease. Maybe Travolta will teach me, he?s a pilot. Seriously though, I was stationed at Fort Hood, they don?t have those kinds of planes there. And the fuel would not have lasted 1,000 years. And do I have to say it?there?s no way people with absolutely no flight training could have flown those planes as shown in the movie. I felt so dirty and dumbed-down after watching this movie, almost ashamed that members of my race, fellow human beings could subject others with the torture of watching this ?major?(ly) horrifying motion picture.

Travolta may have made this movie in order to share the \"storytelling genius\" of his guru Hubbard, but all he succeeded in doing was to give people another reason to avoid anything bearing Hubbard's name.  \n\nBattlefield Earth is a tortured piece of cinematic garbage that attempts to sell the viewer on a number of points - thematic and intellectual.  First, Alien Races are Bad.  This more or less jives with the mythology of Hubbard's \"Religion\" of Scientology, in which an all-powerful alien overlord committed an act of genocide (in space) that resulted in millions of alien 'souls' to become trapped in the bodies of primitive humans after being exiled to Earth.  Just watch the South Park Scientology episode.  The aliens of Travolta's film are evil, greedy, conniving, backstabbing monsters who spend a great deal of time waxing eloquent about their supposedly superior culture, which appears to be nothing more than a strange, propagandist mutation of capitalism.  The dread-locked and nose-ringed aliens are blessed with few - if any - redeeming features, which makes their ultimate doom devoid of any meaning.\n\nA second point:  Humans are basically savages without anyone to lead them.  Our 'hero' in this film is a human slave who, thanks to the machinations of one of the aliens (played tragically, by Forest Whitaker), gains the ability to use language.  That's right; humans in this movie, although attractive and clearly able to use machinery, speak in grunts and snarls.  At any rate, the human, thanks to the unthinking hubris of his captors, gains almost unfettered access to a 'learning machine', which is capable of teaching anyone who sits in it how to do everything from shoot an alien weapon, to pilot both alien vehicles and, confusingly, human fighter jets (which have sat, fueled, armed, and shielded from the elements and alien invasions for hundreds - or thousands - of years).  Thanks to this miracle machine, our hero and his band of scantily clad compatriots devise a plan to rid their world of the monsters (who are here for our gold.  Seriously.), and allow humans to once again rule Earth.\n\nThe acting is awful; the script, even worse.  If one had never seen either Travolta or Whitaker act before, one could be forgiven for thinking that they simply couldn't, or shouldn't ever again.  The effects are good for their time, and the costuming showed an attention to detail that was sorely lacking in the rest of the film.  If someone were to ask me if this movie was a good candidate for an episode of Mystery Science Theatre 3000, I'd say no; it's too bad - even by their standards.",

The one thing that is redeeming about this movie is its unabashed badness.  I think that John Travolta (The Taking of Pelham 123) knew that this movie was terrible, but did it anyways because he thought he owed a dept to Scientology or something.  Even Forrest Whitaker (Where the Wild Things Are) hams it up in this disaster of a film.  What's really disappointing is that Berry Pepper (Seven Pounds) -- who's actually a pretty good actor -- was cast in this mess.

            "content": "\"[Battlefield Earth] is going to make people in Hollywood take notice of Elie Samaha. I'm not going to be the laughing stock any more.\" -- Elie Samaha\n\nI was reading up about this movie and I found this FANTABULOUS quote that, in hindsight, I'm sure Elie Samaha wished he would never have made.  Now I'm not about to say that Elie is a laughing stock for making that statement.  I'm just saying, he's an idiot that he thought the movie he was producing was going to be successful.  If you take into consideration that almost everyone who has seen this movie has said that it's one of the worst movies ever made, then in a way that is succeeding.  You've succeeded in making one shitty, horrid, abysmal, atrocious, ugly movie.  Of course, I'm sure that wasn't exactly Elie's goal (or the two other producers of the movie) wanted to achieve, but hey...what the fuck can you do???  Holy christ fuck, this is really one of the worst (if not the worst) movie I've ever seen.  Now you may ask yourself why I watched this movie if I knew of its reputation.  The answer is simple.  We acquired Starz (and Encore) On Demand for one month last week.  Basically, the deal is, you can watch any movie that they provide without actually having to pay for it like a normal On Demand service.  You pay a monthly fee to watch as many movies as you want, for as many times as you want during the month.  After watching Hot Shots,  I decided to use the computer while I browsed through the Encore On Demand channel.  I came across Battlefield Earth and I clicked on it, thinking that I was only gonna watch a minute or two of it and then not bother.  The only reason I stuck with it was because I wanted to find out if it was really as bad as everyone says it is.  So that's the only reason I watched it.  And in reality I didn't even pay for it, because with all of the movies I wanna watch, Battlefield Earth won't even be a fraction of the monthly bill.  So I watched this movie for free.\n\nFor the first 20 minutes, this movie was so bad that it was awesome.  It's like watching a car crash in slo-mo for 2 hours.  You can't help but look at the disaster that's unfolding before your eyes.   Once the 1 hour mark hit, I was like...christ this isn't \"so bad it's good\" anymore, this is just BAD.  You know before we keep going, let me just say that the special effects in this movie are ABYSMAL.  Of the two movies I watched today, Hot Shots had the better visual effects...and that movie was released in 1991 for fucks sake.  This movie definitely lived up to its billing as one of the worst movies ever made.  Hell I can't think of a worse movie I've seen in YEARS.  Couples Retreat is up there, but at least it has 3 redeeming qualities about it, that being Jason Bateman, Malin Akerman and Kristen Bell.  Two of those were the girls who I thought were really lovely young lasses and their performances really did nothing for me.  I can't really find anything that I actually liked about this movie.  There were some decent explosions near the end there but that's about IT!  Everything else about this movie is just so abysmal.  The dialogue is horrible, the acting is even worse, the movie is shot like it's a low-budget SyFy channel original movie, and the cinematography is even worse, the dutch angles are WAY too much, the story is an absolute fucking mess.  I really didn't know what in the FUCK was going on in this movie and I didn't even care to try to figure it out because it's not like it would have changed the sheer abysmality (yes I made that word up...I think) that the movie is.  I remember mentioning in my Couples Retreat review that if I could have given that movie a zero I would have.  Well I was wrong....that movie DESERVES every bit of that .5 star that it got.  On the other hand, this movie....*shrugs* if I could give this movie a negative score I would.  I would give it a negative all the stars that are in the universe.  And stars in the universe are infinite so that's how bad this movie is.\n\nHell what does that even say about the book.  The book is a 750 pages long (hardcover) and over 1000 (paperback).  Thanks but no thanks, this movie = no buys.  Worst movie ever made??  I can't disagree with anyone who says such a statement.   It's certainly the worst movie I've seen in AGES.",

Battlefield Earth is the most horrible looking, ill-written, poorly acted (and I mean POORLY acted) piece of s*** movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some doozies.\r\n\r\nWhere to start? Ok, the special effects. The settings were horrible looking and unrealistic. It's like a 1st grade class put them up or something. The CG looked like the SyFy channel original movies they spit up every week. I know this was made in the year 2000, but come on! The Matrix had much better Special Effects, and that movie was made a year before this one! The plot is just, well, basic for a Sci-Fi movie. It's in the future and hostile aliens have taken over, and now humanity is an endangered species. So now a bunch of humans want to take back the world from the aliens blah blah blah. The movie could have been tolerable if there was at least some decent writing behind it, but alas, there was none. Now the acting. Ok, I've seen some wooden acting, especially from Sci-Fi movie, but this, this was just so awful! It's like the cast just said, \"F*** It!\" and gave up trying. It was that bad.\r\n\r\nEven with a decent budget and lead actors like John Travolta (who was probably the worst actor in this entire movie) and Barry Pepper (almost as bad) couldn't stop this movie from being a box-office bomb. The writing, plot, effects, and most of all acting, was bad in every department. But hey, at least this movie was famous for something: Being one of the worst films ever made. I only gave it a 10% because of how famous it is for being bad.\r\n\r\nBottom line: DO NOT WATCH!!!!!!!! There should be a label on all copies of this movie saying: DO NOT WATCH. It's just not worth putting yourself through",

If come in with just an open mind, you can see stuff. Zaranyzerak said it well in a video he did saying that \"Trailer Park Boys\" seemed stupid at first glance, but these characters have layers on them. And so they do. I'd say John Travolta is probably the best guy in the line-up. Man, I love his lines. In fact, most of the aliens seem to have better lines then the earthlings. Maybe to show how earth and mankind are loosing the fight unless something great can pull off, and they don't have that much hope. While, the aliens, they have it all and can feel the great lines as much as they please.\r\n\r\nBut, you really feel emotion in these characters. And emotion that only comes from a classic...usually. If there's one thing that matches the Syfy channel, it's the CGI. But, I understand. Imagine a Tie-Fighter 15 feet above the surface of Endor in Star Wars. That would be hard wouldn't it? The emotion, you haft to see it too understand it...and I'm two days late on the review and I was sick while I was watching it. Excuse me for that. Remember The Thing (1982) which is being remade into The Thing (2011) which is a remake of exhibit one and exhibit one is a remake of The Thing From Another World (1953) which is a remake of a short story The Thing (18--). Now that I've co-oped out my short paragraph lemme bring your attention to it.\r\n\r\nIt had no female actresses. Why? Not because they were sexist, but because they didn't need em. The story flowed fine without a lady in it. I do hate when they put in a girl or an African-American JUST to fill in a demographic. If you're gonna put those groups in their, you wanna put them in the plot and not just to be there. Another example is Glory (1989), it doesn't focus on the female actors too much, simply because females didn't have much of a say back in the Civil War era. Fact, probably until the '60's did they not have much say. So, what do we say for Battlefield Earth? Well, it does pretty much try to fill in the demographic of the lady, but they also got TWO other demographics without actually wasting them. They result as John Travolta's partner.\r\n\r\nSo, there are my thoughts without ruining the movie. The Rating? 3.7/5+-",

Well at least in this movie I can clearly understand the plot and motivation of each character...also I can laugh at Travolta's wig.\r\nSo why is it bad?  Well it's 2 hours long and when the ending is as obvious as it is in Battlefield Earth that's a lot of movie to sit through.\r\nThe hero has very little personality, as do the other humans in this story.  It's one of the few times I wished the protagonist would just die so the villain could keep the screen.  Obnoxious and uninteresting is the only way I can really describe Jonnie Goodboy Tyler.\r\nI felt only interested in the aliens.  If I squinted while watching the Phyclos have their evil meetings it felt like I was watching an episode of Star Trek, but with less convincing makeup and dialog. \r\nDespite everything else I felt that Travolta did a pretty good job considering it was his camp that ruined the script.  It may not be what we're used to seeing him in, but he defiantly stands out... perhaps it was just enthusiasm he has for being in a movie inspired by the guy who founded Scientology...\r\n\r\nThe bottom line:  You might get a few laughs out of this movie and may enjoy parts of it, but it's mostly boring and I'd keep the fast forward button handy to skip any scenes without Travolta.  I can't tell if he's the cause for it being bad enough for it to be nominated as \"worst film of the decade\" but somehow his unusual camp performance makes it watchable in the way a car accident is watchable... It's a bad film but not the worst ever or even in it's genera, but it comes pretty darn close.",

Even the much hated styling is passable, but the better parts of the film couldn't carry the ludicrous ending in the way Independence Day got away with an equally (and very similar) stupid climax. \r\n\r\nAh well, having a Heaven's Gate on your CV gives you some sort of cred now Razzies and Rotten Tomatoes makes sure everybody celebrates it.

I actualy like this movie better than star wars episode 1. lol.\r\n\r\n At least it has decent effects and ideas despite campy costumes of John Travolta and Forrest. I have a pet peeve for scifi movies that dont have special effects and are post apocalyptic as its obvious just a cheap out to do low budget. \r\n\r\nIts not an unwatchable movie, Its down thier on the last movies Id watch before watching a B movie. Some of the stuff I did like, at least they use technology. I generaly hate scifi movies that do future or scifi and wimp out because thier so low budget they can only afford regular guns and are anti tech movies. Alot of people poo poo'd this film simply because it came from a scientologist founder. Actualy the book is well worth a read, its the only L. Ron Hubbard book I like. (disliking scientology personaly and not being pro organized religion).\r\n\r\nId rent this as a double feature with waterworld when you absolutely have nothing else to watch, have watched everything ever made and you can remove your brain and\r\ndont want to watch ghosthunters on the scifi channel lol. \r\n\r\nD+ for me. Hey, Id watch this before attack of the killer tomatoes any day. :).

Ron Hubbard, Mr. Scientology himself, this film, which is the essence of vanity project, is really and truly terrible.  Set in the year 3000 (for some reason I can't get the song \"In the Year 2525\" out of my head), 1000 years after the alien Psychlos (large, brutal, and remarkably stupid) have conquered earth, humanity is on the brink of extinction.  Barry Pepper is Johnny Goodboy Tyler, one such human survivor, who, through his own crappy choices, finds himself enmeshed in the plot of Psychlo Terl (John Travolta, who also produced), to mine gold so that Terl can buy his way off planet.  To do so, Terl educates Johnny, teaching him everything he needs to know to lead a rebellion against the Psychlos which results in their overthrow and the destruction of their planet.  Way to go, Terl!  The dialogue is crap.  The plot strains credulity.  John Travolta's acting is unabashedly ATROCIOUS, chewing scenery like it was taffy.  The production values look like a SyFy original film.  There's really so much cheap and bad about this film, how could it do anything but fail?  The cinematography is gratuitous, the editing slipshod.  Director Roger Christian proves that just because you win an Academy Award for set decoration doesn't mean you have any business helming a major motion picture.  Did everything have to be shot at an angle? Seriously?  When you use the same special angle in almost every  shot, it means it's not special anymore!  Especially when you film it all in slow motion!   Long, boring, under produced...this film is a huge hulking mess of a movie and deserves the scorn heaped upon it.  Criminal charges might even be appropriate.  Woodchuck sez, \"Worthless.\"",

If there is then I'd be surprised.  There couldn't be a film with a more appalling script, horrendous acting, a horrible storyline, and unbearable visuals than this. What kind of mindless human-being came up with this dim piece of crap? That piece of crap got flushed down the toilet, sent to it's natural habitat, grew arms and legs, went to Hollywood, and made this crappy film. The script is highly senseless and dumb as hell; the storyline is something that came out of a dumpster filled with flies, garbage, and dumpster juice. For Christ's Sake, it takes place in the year 3000. Each and one of the actors and actresses don't even have any acting abilites what so ever, it is just actless acting. The worst part of all is that the movie is two hours long. Besides the length, the script is the worst part about the film. Really dreadful and dull. This is even worse then just-a-plain- bad-movie. The aliens call the humans Man-Animals. All of the CGI Graphics and special effects are very cartoony. All the humans and aliens have multiple amounts of ponytails and even ponytails growing out of their noses that look to be about four to five feet long. Blame the make-up designers. The characters of the movie are flat-out retarded. It is so hard to follow what's going on because nothing seems to make any sense. It's like one scene to another and to another and to another. The humans eat rats and only rats as their favorite food. Haven't they heard of apples, or bananas? They seem to act like monkeys so why not have eaten bananas? Oh that right. They're cavemen, they don?t know any better. None of the characters names aren't even said or mentioned in the film. I had to go online to \"www.imdb.com\" to find who was which character. It's all senseless. This is by-fact John Travolta worst he has ever done in his entire carrer. It's truly the worst of all the bad acting any film ever. This film is based off of the famous best-selling novel book \"Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000\" I bet the book was better then this trash. If there is anybody out there that likes this movie, they must be smoking crack...and I mean a lot. If there is anybody out there that says that this is the best movie in the world, then they need to be put in an insane asylum...for good. If you like this movie, then you need help. 'Battlefield Earth' is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life and the worst movie ever made of all-time out of all movies ever made. Worst Movie Ever!",

But alas, that is how horrendous of a film Battlefield Earth is.  I was reading several articles regarding a group of films that were chosen for Razzies of the decade (for those of you who are unfamilair the Razzies are awards given each year to the worst films that were released, and celebrates film awfulness in general.  Having only seen Battlefield in theatres and only once (and having bad, but marginally bad views of it), I decided to take the plunge and watch it now, knowing significantly more about movies and what makes one good or really really bad.  And while its not the worst film ever made, it goes into an upper echelon of unspeakably bad films that also blew a LOT of money.  Which is kind of ironic because one of the problems with the film is that it looks like a sci-fi made for tv movie.  The acting is horrible, especially Travolta who is seemingly trying to harken a Shakespearean delivery for his character Terl and sounds more like a homoerotic Englishman, and Forest Whitaker, who is usually a brilliant actor, is painful to watch here.  Adding to the discomfort is a JARRING color palette and the fact the entire movie is filmed with dutch angles.  Those are good for brief effect but for two hours it is nonsensical, unless your Terry Gilliam and know how to use it effectively.  This film is a failure in every way.",

Most movies that are bad, usually have a terrible story or a lack of one but Battlefield Earth was more than just that, it was pretty much everything about it. One example, you can find it on Youtube, there's some sort of council scene, one guy's costume was so badly made that you can tell that he was wearing a mask or some sort of make up and it that same scene something else was done so poorly, you just have to check it out yourself, it's hilarious. This movie is usually chosen as the worst or one of the worst movies ever but it's really hard to determine what movie is the worst of all time. Is it the story? The acting? The mistakes within the film? Yes but it's also how much the budget was because if you are spending like $100,000,000 you make damn sure it's a good movie. It's also hard to compare a bad comedy with a bad action movie like this one because a bad comedy is just a whole lot of bad jokes but when a movie like Battlefield Earth is trying to be serious but turns out laughable then you know it's a BAD film.",

If there is then I'd be surprised.  There couldn't be a film with a more appalling script, horrendous acting, a horrible storyline, and unbearable visuals than this. What kind of mindless human-being came up with this dim piece of crap? That piece of crap got flushed down the toilet, sent to it's natural habitat, grew arms and legs, went to Hollywood, and made this crappy film. The script is highly senseless and dumb as hell; the storyline is something that came out of a dumpster filled with flies, garbage, and dumpster juice. For Christ's Sake, it takes place in the year 3000. Each and one of the actors and actresses don't even have any acting abilites what so ever, it is just actless acting. The worst part of all is that the movie is two hours long. Besides the length, the script is the worst part about the film. Really dreadful and dull. This is even worse then just-a-plain- bad-movie. The aliens call the humans Man-Animals. All of the CGI Graphics and special effects are very cartoony. All the humans and aliens have multiple amounts of ponytails and even ponytails growing out of their noses that look to be about four to five feet long. Blame the make-up designers. The characters of the movie are flat-out retarded. It is so hard to follow what's going on because nothing seems to make any sense. It's like one scene to another and to another and to another. The humans eat rats and only rats as their favorite food. Haven't they heard of apples, or bananas? They seem to act like monkeys so why not have eaten bananas? Oh that right. They're cavemen, they don?t know any better. None of the characters names aren't even said or mentioned in the film. I had to go online to \"www.imdb.com\" to find who was which character. It's all senseless. This is by-fact John Travolta worst he has ever done in his entire carrer. It's truly the worst of all the bad acting any film ever. This film is based off of the famous best-selling novel book \"Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000\" I bet the book was better then this trash. If there is anybody out there that likes this movie, they must be smoking crack...and I mean a lot. If there is anybody out there that says that this is the best movie in the world, then they need to be put in an insane asylum...for good. If you like this movie, then you need help. 'Battlefield Earth' is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life and the worst movie ever made of all-time out of all movies ever made. Worst Movie Ever!",

As in the Alien series, ET and even the Predator movies, often the âalienâ actorâs face is never seen but here Travolta plays the lead alien so of course he has to be seen.\n\nThen thereâs the boots... yes the boots! The âPhsycloâ race of aliens are 9 feet tall, this is achieved by putting the actors in Spice Girl boots with 7 inch thick soles and tapering their heads to a point like Dan Ackroydâs Coneheads characters! This makes it clearly difficult to walk and impossible to run... keep in mind these aliens keep the fast and agile human race as slaves. How on earth do they even catch one?\n\nThen thereâs the hands, swathed in thick latex gloves to make them look bigger... it makes it difficult to pick anything up and the can barely hold onto the âadvancedâ firearms they use, let alone aim and fire them!\n\nThen thereâs the plot holes, humans waltzing through highly radioactive areas with no ill effect, a group of men who have no written language no grasp of numbers or simple mathematics are able to teach themselves how to fly AND take into combat a squadron of Hawker Harrier Jump Jets in a Star Wars like arial dog fight... in 7 days! A group of men enter the abandoned Fort Knox to get the gold for their fiendish scheme, but guess what... the vault door is wide open and the gold is STILL there! (Even though we know the reason it is so heavily guarded and that there hasnât been an audit of the gold since 2000 is because the US doesnât have any gold reserves.) The big plan to kill all the aliens by collapsing their atmosphere dome so they suffocate has one flaw... weâve already seen that they ALL carry breathing apparatus!\n\nIts a cross between a bad episode of Star Trek and Frankenstein... even one of the scenes where the lead character smashes through a series of plate glass windows is ripped off of Bladerunner. With lines like âYou still get to be head of security which from what I can tell is a pretty âkusshyâ jobâ...âkushy jobâ?! Thats something that Dellboy Trotter would say!\n\nI guess those involved probably thought, âHe MUST know what heâs doing... heâs John Travolta!â But, if youâre gonna dress up like a clown, people ARE gonna laugh.",

He's a great actor and anything else is just sour grapes.",

De toute facon, le desastre aux dimensions mythologiques qu'est Battlefield Earth n'autorise meme pas de telles considerations : entre les aliens au look de klingons jamaicains nourris aux steroides, les dialogues qui frisent le cretinisme le plus profond (au sens medical du terme) et des absurdites monumentales telles que ces rebelles humains qui passent en une semaine du binome gourdin/cailloux a la maitrise du chasseur a reaction, le film est une vaste blague, involontairement bien plus hilarante que \"Spaceballs\".  Sans compter que le montage est une veritable insulte a l'esprit humain : aucune structure temporelle ou geographique digne de ce nom, aucune coherence, aucun sens de la transition ou de la dramatisation.  A vrai dire, on est bien incapable d'entraver quoi que ce soit aux subtilites du scenario mais apres tout, rien ne dit qu'il en comportait et encore moins que ca valait la peine d'y entraver quelque chose.  Ceux qui seront encore debout au terme de cette vomitive abomination oscilleront entre le baillement de desespoir et l'incomprehension d'avoir perdu deux heures de leur vie a ca.  Meme \"Plan 9 from outer space\" avait pour lui une certaine fraicheur et une volonte de depasser les contraintes de son budget larvaire.  Dans le cas de Battlefield Earth, jamais autant d'argent n'a ete depense d'une facon aussi stupide en aussi peu de temps, meme si l'investissement lui a permis de remporter le titre de pire bouse SF de l'histoire du cinema.  On a les victoires qu'on peut.",

I certainly wouldn't go that far - it's a run-of-the mill science fantasia of noble humans striving to throw off the yoke of alien invasion and conquest. At times it's entertaining, at others it reduces itself to risible pap. Throughout, it testifies to that essential lesson which Hollywood again and again fails to learn - a good film is based on a good, well-worked script, something which gives the actor's parts they can make come alive, something which gives the audience the opportunity and excuse to suspend disbelief and become lost in the story.\n\nEarth has been seized by an alien corporation whose executives and storm troopers strut around in big boots - they look like heavy metal clowns, maybe even punk Ronald McDonalds! The corporation owns the franchise to the Earth and is stripping it of its resources. Head honcho John Travolta is passed over for promotion, so conceives a plan to use some of the human captives to perpetrate a major heist and set him up for life. Little does he realise that he will set in motion a chain of actions which will threaten to expel the aliens from Earth and restore it to human control.\n\nDid I say 'little does he realise'? Well, Travolta must have realised, but then he'd read the script! He was the leading light behind the making of this movie - which is based on a story by Scientology head honcho, L.Ron Hubbard. Making the film was something of an article of faith for Travolta. Watching it may well be a triumph of the will.\n\nIt's a multi-million dollar extravaganza which is entertaining in the places where it is not entirely trite. Travolta camps up his role, no one else has much of a role to speak of. The humans are stereotypes, the film is utterly derivative, but fails to match the science fiction films which clearly influenced it. Action drags on and on, predictably. Need I say more?",

But with all the stars in this movie is certainly doesn't look or seem starry, in fact is seems shitty.  How films like this make it past the script and into pre-production, let alone out of it, is beyond me.  I thought that people in Hollywood had at least a little taste but this film disproves that notion with a vengeance.\n\nThe plot is a paper-thin as you can get, the year is 3000 and the human race is nearly extinct (the opening scene makes this overtly clear, numerous times, like we didn't catch the drift the first time), and a man is sent from one of the colonies in exile for breaking too many rules.  Along the way he meets some other people and they lead him in a thousand year old mall that looks just as fantastic as ever.  While they are eating, they are attacked, taken by an alien race called Psychlo's (the ones who annihilated the human race).  What happens next is a long, stringy, series of events leading to the humans fighting back in a rebellion and blah-de-fricking-blah.  Quite frankly we could care less.\n\nThe acting is bad... I mean bad; whether is was on purpose or not, I don't know.  John Travolta's talents are totally, 100% wasted in this movie and Forest Whitaker delivers his worst performance of his career.  Barry Pepper may be out hero (His name is Johnnie Goodboy Taylor, which makes at least a little sense since he and everyone else in this film and apparently behind it has the intelligence of a inbred mutt) but he is not memorable in this film for anything but giving a bad performance that still doesn't reek as much as the script.\n\nAnd as for the screenplay, it is horrid.  Two dimensional is too broad a term to describe these characters, there actions are as incomprehensible as the dialogue and the plot and they have absolutely no personality.  Some of them we apparently are even supposed to care for but since they say no more then twenty words throughout the whole movie, we don't.  The film is laughably silly and pretentious.  It is also incompetent, half-assed and full of inconsistency.  Doe's it make sense that 1000-year-old paper is still white?  That 1000-year-old planes still fly and 1000-year-old nuclear bombs still blow up planets (another inconsistency in and of itself quickly tied-up with a bit of mindless dialogue).  Also, the year 3000 and the Earth is a rapid wasteland, yet all the electricity works?  Right.\n\nThis film does have some entertainment on the pure basis that it really is this bad.  Is it as bad as such trash like 10,000 BC?  Not quite, but damn it it tries!\n\n\n1/2 out of ****",

            "content": "Scientology guru L Ron Hubbard started out with this dreck. His books were hideous hack meat, but for some reason, he was popular, and he started a religion, er cult, after that. This is one of his books made into a John Travolta movie, where he plays an alien called Turl, a Psychlo (sounds like psycho), on a captured Earth in 3000. (In the book it was 2000, because it was done in the 70s).  Turl is a mean alien, but for some reason he decides to do something incredibly stupid. He knows if the slave humans are made smart, it will be trouble, so he does it anyway. He educates a bunch of primitve humans in geometry and physics, (using a Scientology-like mind device) and they start using sophisticated fighter jets that shouldn't have any gas left in them. And then something unintensionally funny happens to their methan rich planet. Ha! Okay, just assume it is 3000, unlike the book, nothing with gas would work. No planes. Assume also nukes would have corrided long ago. No story. It would have not made snense to set in in 2000, (when that stuff works), but then again, it doesn't make any sense. This movie is revoltingly bad. It's not even so bad it's good. The Psychlos are about as scary and cool as going to watch plants grow on a hydroponics shelf, or trying to decipher what anyone was thinking green-lighting this horrid movie. Not just the worst science fiction movie of 2000, or of this decade, but probably since the book came out! Wow. \"Take them and see how they like it!\" hahahaha! Dialogue was not even dialogue in this movie.",
