            "content": "Cast Away isn't a bad movie or anything, it's just a tough sell in 2023. It's very 2000. Tom Hanks is good in it but the production and direction of blockbusters from this era carry a familiar cadence to one another outside of a few stand outs. This still has family friendly 90s undertones without it being a family movie at heart. It's a tough thing to put your finger on exactly, but it certainly detracts from what would be a grittier situation than is portrayed. I'm not exactly sure what it is about movies like American Beauty or Erin Brockovich that help them to age better but Cast Away just feels old. \n\nThat all said, it has an interesting spin on the stranded on an island schtick. Particularly that it handles his re-entry to society and it isn't all roses. It's probably too long, but it's still an overall enjoyable experience.",

Tom Hank's character (Chuckie) has a wacky persona about him that I don't quite like or care for, but it does carry this wacky 4.5 hour movie all the way from start to finish. I laughed very hard when Tom Hanks kept thinking Wilson was a real person! Wake up Tom!! xD Anyways, the movie is basically Tom Hank's character (Chuckie) getting a FREE vacation to a tropical island for 4 years, and when he returns -- all he gets is a slap on the wrist from  the \"boys will be boys\" mentality-leadership at FedEx® !!! Umm yeah right!! If I ever requested THAT much time off -- it be good bye job for me! \n\nOverall, I was shocked (like many of us) that this hidden-camera documentary finally unveil the truth of FedEx's ridiculous training module. To think they do this for every new employee - just to test their commitment to delivering packages. Of course , Tom Hanks being a professional, he still delivered the package at the end of the training course... but sheesh!",

It has a lot of clever concepts which feel like tropes today, but were very novel when it came out. Tom Hanks gives the performance of a lifetime; his emotional scenes are raw and deep-cutting.\n\nUnfortunately, Chuck is just a complete fucking idiot. It's incredibly frustrating to watch him make even the most basic of decisions while trying to survive on the island. He makes irrational choices and wastes resources in a completely unbelievable way. I get that he's supposed to be portrayed as an isolated person with no life experience outside of his devotion to FedEx (for some fucking reason), but a lot of this stuff is just basic common sense that ruins the immersion of the film.\n\nFar from perfect, this movie is saved by its direction and by Hanks's performance.",

But this wonderfully silent movie grabbed me from the beginning. The leading role, Tom Hanks gave a brilliant performance. One of the iconic parts is Chuck's relationship with the volleyball, Wilson. So touching! The ending is sort of unsatisfactory but still wonderful. Maybe I want happy ending for him. However, it is meaningful and thought-provoking movie. His resilience and hope made him stronger to survive on an isolated island. I highly recommend this movie if you are a fan of drama/adventure movies.",

I got many great life-lessons by seeing how Chuck struggles to survive on the island alone and his journey to get home. My favorite part in the movie is how he makes up \"Wilson\",the volleyball, as his random conversation partner. Heart-warming!!  \nIn my opinion, it is gripping from the beginning to the end. I love that the movie itself is interesting to watch and its surprising turns and changes can carry on the viewers. Personally, I want to give 8/10 for this movie!",

Being alone doesn't necessarily mean being lonely. It is actually in solitude that man learns to be strong, where he learns to depend on his own strength and reflect on his weaknesses.",

It adds to the immersion and that feeling of being present on this island with Chuck. There is something extremely reflective and meditative about Cast Away that I haven't quite seen in another film. Ultimately this movie can lead you to questions about your own life and I cannot commend a movie enough for provoking these types of thoughts.\n\nOne of the most emotional movies of all time.

Hanks is great in the lead role, the cinematography is excellent, and the story moves along at a nice pace for the first 100 minutes or so.  However, the final thirty minutes, most of which probably should have been left on the editing room floor, is Hollywood soppiness at its worst, especially the reunion scene, one of the most shameless attempts to tug at the heartstrings ever committed to celluloid.

            "content": "Robert Zemeckis' \"Cast Away\" is an intense, profound and heartwarming survival drama that showcases Tom Hanks at his absolute best. With his twelfth feature, director Robert Zemeckis crafted a powerful drama about a FedEx employee that struggles to survive on a South Pacific island. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to humanize the lives of stranded plane-crash victims, but he pulled it off seamlessly. Using spellbinding cinematography, Zemeckis draws viewers into the world of a resourceful FedEx employee stranded on an isolated island. From intimate close-ups to stunning establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's setting. Zemeckis showcases immense technical control over the sound design, locations and visual effects, immersing viewers into the desolate setting. William Broyles Jr.'s screenplay is also sensational, and effectively uses minimal dialogue to convey the isolation faced by the main character. It is hard to not praise the phenomenal performances from the cast. Tom Hanks delivers one of the finest performances of his career as Chuck Noland. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys the angst, desperation and resourcefulness of a man that is forced to use his instincts to survive on a stranded island. Although \"Cast Away\" is undeniably an unforgettable survival drama, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At nearly two and a half hours, it suffers from a lengthy running-time that tests the viewer's patience. Nevertheless, fans of survival dramas will definitely enjoy \"Cast Away\" and so will movie-goers seeking heartfelt entertainment. As someone fortunate enough to have never been stranded on an island, it made me cherish my life and feel grateful for things that I too often take for granted.",

            "content": "Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away is a heartbreaking tale saturated with subtleties in both the story it tells and it's surroundings. Zemeckis' attention to the architecture and detail of every scene makes the film one of the greatest I've ever seen. Everything from the main protagonist's name, Chuck Noland (Who literally has \"no land\" around him) to subtle symbols and facts scattered throughout make this film a true masterpiece of production.\n\nIn its content, Cast Away shows the psychological strain that can be caused by prolonged isolation. This becomes more apparent as we follow Chuck Through his tragedy. Chuck gives his girlfriend Kelly a present on Christmas before boarding a plane and asks her to only open it on new year's, he then promises he'll be there with her when she does. A storm takes down Chuck's plane in a spectacular scene with warning lights flashing, thunder roaring, lightning striking and darkness dominating the camera frame. Chuck almost drowns with the plane, but his lifeboat is released just in time and he's stuck with nothing but a lifeboat. He makes it to a deserted island, where he spends the next four years. soon after his arrival, we start seeing FedEx packages washing up on the island. In a place where no one can reach Chuck, his job does. \n\nIn one of these packages, he finds a volleyball sent as a gift to \"Johnny\" from his grandfather. After failing to start a fire and injuring his hand in the process, Noland throws the ball in a fit of anger and imprints a bloody hand on it. He then goes to retrieve it and, due to the loneliness he suffers from, decides to draw a face on it. He calls it \"Wilson,\" the manufacturing company's name whose logo was on the ball. \nAt first, Chuck speaks to the ball in a sarcastic manner. He maintains \"critical distance\" from it; He understands that Wilson is fictional and doesn't expect any real interaction with him. As time goes on however, Chuck starts to develop a real connection to Wilson. He sees Wilson as his companion through this isolation and loses all critical distance from him. He starts having full conversations with Wilson and almost drowns trying to retrieve Wilson when he floats away in the ocean. He is devastated by Wilson's loss and throws away his makeshift oars as a sign of surrender.\n\nThe film also has other subtleties that add to its overall atmosphere. One very interesting one is the whale that shows up when Noland leaves the island on his makeshift raft after being stranded there for over four years. Whales are usually a sign of solitude, but in the film, the whale is the first creature that Noland feels an emotional connection with in four years, and that shows when they make prolonged eye contact. This whale takes care of Noland and even saves his life by waking him up just in time for him to see the rescue boat passing by.\n\nAnother important sign is the pocket watch Kelly gives Chuck on Christmas. It belonged to her grandfather and helped him survive the southern pacific, which is exactly where Chuck's crash happens. The pocket watch (More importantly Kelly's photo in it) was a key part to his survival. It kept him little company, but he made the most of it and survived, bringing up the watch's \"lifesaver\" count to 2. \n\nThe most important detail however is the angel wings logo on Dick and Bettina's ranch. The ranch is where the film begins (\"ex nihilo\") and where it ends. The logo was also on one of the packages that Chuck had with him on the island, and it is the only package that he left unopened for his entire 4 years there. Those angel wings can be seen as a sign of good and protection, and that is exactly what that package does to Chuck; It saves his life. When he makes it back to civilization, he finally delivers the package back to the ranch, along with a message that says \"This package saved my life. Thank you.\" He held on to it with the hope that he can deliver it someday, and that gave him motivation to continue surviving.\n\nWhen Chuck ends up stranded, his life is in the hands of nature. Nature is what feeds him, but it also injures and punishes him. Nature here is in binary opposition with itself; It is both Noland's guidance and his obstruction. Nature rewards him with coconuts from trees around him and marine life to feed him, but the same waves that bring him help also bring him harm. His first \"Help\" sign is washed away by the waves, and he is thrown by waves into a rock when he tries to leave the island for the first time, severely injuring his thighs.\n\nOverall, the architecture and \"Easter eggs\" in Cast Away can have a separate movie explaining them all, and it is this attribute that makes Cast Away one of the greatest film I've ever seen.",

I'm sure there will be wags who will glibly compare Cast Away to the likes of \"Gilligan's Island\" and \"Survivor\", but, in tone, approach, and overall accomplishment, this atypical Robinson Crusoe tale bears a strong resemblance to one of director Robert Zemeckis' earlier efforts, Contact. No, Cast Away isn't about space or messages from another planet, but, at its core, neither was Contact. Both films ask the same crucial existential question, one that Shakespeare pondered for years: taking all things into account, what does it mean to be human? How do we cope with loss, hopelessness, and isolation, and still find the courage to face the next day? The love and dream of a dead father sustained Jodie Foster's character in Contact. For Tom Hanks' Chuck Noland in Cast Away, it is the promise offered by the smile of his equally absent - and equally beloved - wife-to-be. A magical experience. ",

'Wilson the ball' is a nice touch too, helping further convey his deteriorating sanity.\n\nThe runtime, however, is a little too long, and the films pacing may not be for everyone. The first 20 minutes before the plane crash aren't that interesting either. If you're into deep character studies with a leisure pace(which I personally don't mind when done right), this may blow you away, but if you prefer things to be a little more condensed and brisk, you'll likely end up bored.\n\nCast Away is nonetheless a solid and unique movie anchored by Tom Hanks lead performance, and some beautiful cinematography.",
