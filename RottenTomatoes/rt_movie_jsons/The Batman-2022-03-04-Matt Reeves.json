The overall story the of how greed corrupts was great, but wish the riddler was a little different. This is not to say, Paul Dano didn't do an amazing job, he did. I just expected a different motivation and attitude with the riddler, but that could be me looking to far into it. I do look forward to where they go with this dark atmosphere of Gotham there could be a lot of avenues to explore.",

His love interest and moral philosopher is the criminal ninja warrior (catworman).  They are in a sort-of forbidden relationship (criminal /crime fighter) while paradoxically Batman grows to understand through their intimate conversations where they sometimes make-out that he is the product of BOTH of their fathers sins\u2026meanwhile catwoman has suffered at the hands of both of their fathers.  But then we learn that Batman's dad actually deserves a little credit - yes he got mixed up with the wrong people but ultimately what happened was not intentional - and father Wayne ultimately accepted accountability and paid the price with his life.  Alfred told him this after suffering a brutal attack but looking at the actions of this Batman, there was still no forgiveness deserved for himself or his murdered father.  Later on, there is a scene where Batman appears to be resigned to death - even though we learn later - he was basically fine.  He took what looked like a direct gunshot to the chest armor and after cliffhanger rescue by catwoman he ends up on the floor apparently gravely wounded or possibly dying in her arms until\u2026danger re-emerges and then he heroically stabs himself with a Batman EpiPen \u2026or whatever... some magic drugs let him fight on.  And then shortly afterward Batman is somehow physically healthy again but is now in a dramatic scene where it looks like he is committing suicide for no reason.  After he's already subdued all the bad guys with catwoman and Gordon and they are in no imminent danger he randomly decides to cuts his own line so he can free fall from a Jumbotron with his eyes-glazed over?  Apparently it's so he can land in some waist deep flood waters and then easily rescue some random people who are also not in any imminent danger and then casually walk with them to safety, while holding a torch like Statue of Liberty\u2026.WTF??  I will say that it started good- and I like Jeffrey Wright as Gordon otherwise this is definitely a rotten tomato.",

Reeves has breathed new life into the Batman franchise with his fresh take on the character, and has created a Gotham City that is both gritty and realistic. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Zo\u00eb Kravitz as Catwoman and Paul Dano as The Riddler. 'The Batman' is a must-see film that is sure to satisfy both die-hard Batman fans and newcomers to the franchise alike. Matt Reeves has truly outdone himself with this film, and I cannot wait to see what he has in store for the future of the Dark Knight.",

I it they literally did everything that they possibly could to dumb this movie down to make it so that I wished I was 14 years old again so that I could relate to this movie. \nThat's how dumb this movie was. It was an hour too long, the editing was terrible, Batman really was not all that heroic, and the ridiculous scenes at the end with him saving the children was just so stupid and juvenile and desperate. \n\nThe only thing I liked about this movie was Paul Dano's performance. Turturro was good, he just did not have much to work with. And it was atmospheric. Very dark. Perhaps too dark. And I like dark. \n\nIt was just a really terrible movie. It did have good production values but Robert Pattinson played it with a monotony that was very tiresome, as he tried hard to be a depressed billionaire, and it just wasn't an interesting character. \n\nThere wasn't much to this film, it was not entertainment, and this film felt like it was seven or eight hours long. Why did I sit through it? That's going to be the question that I ask myself every day for the next week or two, why did I sit through it, what was I thinking?",

The movie is also WAY TOO LONG, you could've cut a lot of elements and miss very little. Batman doesn't even fight The Riddler, making this the only Batman movie where Batman doesn't fight the main villain. The action is cool but subpar, the acting is decent but not great, the effects are cool but look fake and all in all, there are too many elements that don't make me enjoy this movie as much as I wanted to like it.

It manages to tie together two separate storylines quite well up to the 2 hour mark, at which point an entirely different movie is suddenly slapped on at no additional charge. The climax of the film is a narrative train wreck that feels rushed in spite of the film's overly long runtime. The overall motif of Batman inspiring other people to take the law in their own hands is an interesting take, and Bruce's words at the end leave me interested in what direction they'll take this iteration of the Bat.",

CGI, I think that his movie also has the best CGI in Batman movie history. Villain, I like Riddler but I think that the villains should have been Joker but since The Batman 2 is confirmed I think that Joker should have been the villain. Writing, I love the writing so much I think that I can not explain how much I love it. Story/Plot no doubt a straight 10/10. Casting is a 10/10. Characters is a 10/10. Mystery, this movies mystery is more than amazing it's so so so perfect. Ending this might be the greatest ending in 2022. some people are debating on YouTube which is the better movie Dark Knight or The Batman and the answer is Dark Knight for obvious reason but The Batman comes very close.",

My favorite part was Reeves leaving the warpaint / eye shadow on the character... it was perfect, really showcased the ghastly edge of Bruce.

            "content": "It's no secret that Batman has quite a few movies under his utility belt, but there's one core aspect of his character that's rarely been shown on the big screen: his detective skills. He is known as the \"World's Greatest Detective\" after all, yet in most of his films, we don't see him do much investigating\u2026 until now. More so than a traditional comic book movie, \u2018The Batman', from director/producer/co-writer Matt Reeves, is a detective story, a refreshing change of pace from the character's previous live-action installments. In the film, Gotham City's elite and \"upstanding\" citizens become the targets of a mysterious serial killer called the Riddler, and Batman (two years into his crime-fighting crusade), along with GCPD Lieutenant Jim Gordon, must solve his clues in order to put an end to the bloodshed, all the while uncovering corruption and lies kept hidden by the city's rich and powerful. Along the way, they encounter an intriguing cast of characters, including unlikely ally Selina Kyle, crime boss Carmine Falcone, and Oswald \"Oz\" Cobblepot aka the Penguin, Falcone's lieutenant and proprietor of the Iceberg Lounge nightclub. Every single member of the cast is incredible, with many of them becoming my personal favorite live-action adaptations of their respective character, such as Robert Pattinson's titular Dark Knight, who exudes a quiet intensity and is able to convey a multitude of emotions without speaking a word, and Colin Farrell's Penguin, who is utterly unrecognizable in the role and steals every scene he's in, to name a few. The film itself is captivating and incredibly well-paced despite having a nearly 3-hour runtime, and my eyes were glued to the screen throughout the entirety of it. One reason for this is the fact that \u2018The Batman' is easily the most beautifully-shot comic book movie I've ever seen, due to the exceptionally brilliant work of cinematographer Greig Fraser. I also have to give major praise to composer Michael Giacchino and production designer James Chinlund, whose music and sets elevated the film to a whole new level and filled me with excitement, suspense, and many more emotions. Overall, Matt Reeves and co. have proven that they truly understand the characters they're working with and have crafted a smart, gripping masterpiece set in a new Bat-universe which I'm incredibly eager to revisit as soon as possible and will hopefully continue for many years to come.",

Es una pel\u00edcula con buena direcci\u00f3n, buen guion, buena ambientaci\u00f3n, buena banda sonora, buena edici\u00f3n, etc. Si bien, puede que como pel\u00edcula de superheroes no cumpla las expectativas de algunas personas, pero es un thriller policial lleno de acci\u00f3n y suspenso bastante decente y aceptable. Todo eso la convierte por definitiva en una de las mejores pel\u00edcula de Batman jamas hecha. Mi nota para esta pel\u00edcula es un 10/10.",

            "content": "This was a true riveting mystery without all the campy cringe-worthy antics usually found in Batman movies of old. For once Gotham and the Caped Crusader were believable and engaging. \n\nI felt as if I was watching a crime drama with the detective tracking a serial killer. This detective just happened to dress in an intimidating bat costume (which was also more gritty and realistic), and had excellent, believable fighting skills. There were some great twists and surprises that made this story even more entertaining.\n\nThe sets, lighting, and music worked together seamlessly to pull me in to the world where Gotham City was real and corruption thrived. There were no campy costumes and Catwoman didn't purr like a cartoon villain. The criminals didn't have gimmicky lairs and even the Batcave came across as rugged and realistic. If I didn't know any better I would have thought someone dropped New York City in a dark Washington State during the rainy season.\n\nOverall I would name this the best Batman ever in both movies and television. The actors were believable, sympathetic, and I actually cared what happened to them. I'll admit when I heard Robert Pattinson was going to be the new Batman, I scoffed at the idea; but he proved me wrong. He turned out to be one of the best. I hope this franchise continues through many more films.",

            "content": "On first viewing, in the theater, I thought The Batman to be loud, long, and somewhat slow-paced. I found the slow motion scenes to be overly used and detracting from the story. I didn't love Andy Serkis as Alfred. Pattinson, though he had impressed me in his post-glampire appearances, was far from my first choices to don the cape. And DC has dropped one steaming turd after another in the past decade and a half as if a team of caffeinated tweens were running the entire WBfilm studios. \n\nBut ultimately I dismissed these as minor gripes, ate my popcorn, and somewhat enjoyed a sunday movie which I intended on quickly forgetting. \n\nBut I didn't forget it. I thought about...a lot. It bugged me that I liked it more than I wanted to, and I wanted to hate it. I got on YouTube to seek out scathing video reviews to help me feel better about wanting to hate it, there's PLENTY on there.  Which is when I happened on a YouTube video posted by the channel: Macabre Storytelling called \"Why The Batman is NOT a Batman Film\". ( https://youtu.be/tyRnkwo4Pds ) and it completely changed my mind. It gave such a fresh perspective that, in my haste to hate, had originally gone well over my head. After viewing the movie a second time, this time through the lens of perspective given by the video, I see The Batman as arguably the best Batman Film to date. \n\nThat slow pacing and those slo-mo shots no longer irked me. They drew me in to the emotional weight of the story, allowing me to soak in the surrounding atmosphere. Permitting me to experience a quiet moment in an otherwise chaotic City. Seeing Batman where he is between the angry kid from origin tales and the polished veteran crimefighter of later years...seeing him as a still confused young man in his coming of age tale, processing the results of his actions and seeing that he is a small part of the bigger picture...really resonated in a way that no other batman Film has done before. He had the power, but hadn't yet figured out the responsibility. He isn't Batman yet, he is just raw, and mostly blind, if not at least tone deaf \"vengeance\". \n\nPaul Dano's Riddler was chilling, haunting, and such a refreshing take on a character that has been too often cast as comic relief. Pattinson shined in a role where the one-dimensionality of the character is intentional. The real test will be in the (hopeful) sequel where he'll have the chance to spread his acting wings and we'll see his diversity as Batwayne. Zoe is a very strong actress, she shines here. And she's stunning in a role where she is comically undersized for. Her fight scenes, though well shot and very exciting, were a hard pill to swallow given her diminutive stature. But I was no less entertained. \n \nIt has subtly brilliant storytelling with some gorgeously choreographed violence, that often gets overlooked to the casual or average comic book movie fan. These \"fans\" watch for the action and the side humor (which has taken a far too comfortable front seat over in the MCU these days), and shun anything that could be mistaken for intelligence. With its attention to detail and depth of character rivaling Fincher himself, it's more a film, than a movie. And that, to some, is too high of a concept to comprehend. I can't help but give The Batman damn close to five stars. A not quite profound, but deeply appreciated pleasure to experience.",

            "content": "I have always been obsessed with Batman from an early age as I have watched the animated series, the Justice League series, Lego Batman and other Batman media content. As I grew up, I stopped watching Batman related media for a while until this movie released. Directed by Matt Reeves, The Batman 2022 is a reboot from the previous Batman films and this time, this movie depicts a more realistic Gotham city with a dark, noir and  detective style story of Batman who takes on the job of protecting Gotham city and when I mean by realistic, there are no superpowers and superhuman beings at all. Realistic scenarios, realistic hand to hand combat scenes, vehicles and the list could go on. This movie is very different from your usual action packed superhero films like the movies  Marvel would usually make. So, I suggest you turn back if you are one of those superhero movie fans that cares about action scenes and superpowers because you are going to witness something different.\n    The film itself is aesthetically pleasing and I mean it for the entire movie which I will explain more about later in this review.\n   The story takes place 2 years after The Batman publicized himself to Gotham city, a city with filled with corruption and crime. While keeping a lookout for the city, a serial killer named Riddler emerges and starts killing influential figures of Gotham city, whom all have  corrupt connections to each other and also leaving clues that leads up to an even greater conspiracy. Batman must solve all these mysteries and riddles in order to find out who the next target is, solve the conspiracy and put an end to the Riddler. Does he have what it takes to stop the Riddler?\nRobert Pattinson nails the role as Batman: a depressed and edgy caped crusader (this is what most people like to call him) who is scarred by the death of his parents 20 years ago caused by a group of criminals. He was able to capture the vibe of a dark and depressed person that Batman is: Does not talk much, blunt and an intimidating vigilante that the Batman is known for. He also played the other side of Batman as well, Bruce Wayne. When Bruce is not under his mask and suit, he is just a depressed billionaire who owns the Wayne enterprise and deals with public affairs and still as edgy as Batman. Robert Pattison was able to portray both Bruce Wayne and Batman very well. You can just look into his eyes and feel that dark and gloomy vibe.\n Supporting roles like the Cat woman (Zoey was spot on with the sassy attitude) and commissioner police Gordon were also done very well as they were able to show how it is like to partner up with Batman, who is stubborn, quiet and straightforward. Paul Dano as the Riddler was immaculate as he managed to play as a menacing and mentally deranged person who is just a normal human being that can cause disruption and violence in Gotham city. He showed off his performance even furthermore in the scene where he talks with Batman in Arkham Asylum.  Colin Farrell also brought the character Penguin to life with the accent and the personality which was spot on like the comics. The same exact thing could be said for the actor who played the crime boss Carmine Falcone. All the actors managed to bring the characters to life just by the way they talked in the movie. You could even feel the tension during the characters' conversations.\n\n  Cinematography in this movie is top tier. Some will think the camera work is too much, but I think that doing too much is what made the film beautiful. The still shots of Gotham city from different perspectives, still shots of the characters, the shots of Batman looking over Gotham city, the dark color palate used and especially the lighting the movies uses, it makes the film look and feel dark. The fight scenes' fast paced camera work was executed properly as it perfectly choreographed all the fighting moves and the camera follows the Batman while he performs all these fighting techniques making us feel the intense action.\nThe scene where Batman revs up his Bat mobile in the dark and reveals himself was one of the best cameras work, I have seen in my life. The way the engine lights up showing the flames, the full view of the Batmobile from all perspective, the terrifying engine sounds the Batmobile makes, it's just top tier. That moment was pure hype fuel.  I could feel that intimidating appearance of the Batmobile. The movie felt immersive due to its excellent camera work and cinematography.\n   The music and soundtrack used was a perfect fit for the impressive cinematography as the music enhanced every moment in the movie. Every fight scene and chase scenes felt intense due to the fitting soundtrack. You could even feel the tension between the characters conversations.\n However, the length of the movie felt unnecessary in my opinion. Sure, all the scenes were pretty, but some scenes could be cut out as it felt like it, they were not necessary for the movie's plot. With that time, they could have explored more areas of Gotham city or show more characters. Other than that, the movie is superb.\n   Overall, this Batman movie is a dark, gritty and realistic take on Batman and Gotham city with a fascinating psychological thriller story that will keep you asking many questions while watching the film. This film will not be for those who enjoy action packed superhero films as this movie have dark and depressing themes and the long length of the film might scare some people away. But try it out, see if you like it or not. I would recommend this movie to every Batman fans though. 4/5 stars movie and very excited for a sequel.",

He is supposed to be young, angsty and emotional. He is still grieving over the loss of his parents after all. The movie does run a little long at 2:56:00, but that really doesn't take away from anything if you have an attention span longer than 25 seconds. Long, but an excellent film to establish the universe. That being said, I cannot wait to see what else Matt Reeves brings to the table!",

            "content": "\u2018Planet of the Apes' writer/director Matt Reeves directs Robert Pattinson in this stylish reboot of the caped crusader. Pattinson leads an A-list cast that includes Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell, Paul Dano and Andy Serkis. Reeves delivers a masterclass in filmmaking, bringing a dark, gritty adaptation of Batman to the screen that leaves you wanting more as soon as the credits roll.\n\nWhen The Riddler (Paul Dano) begins his killing spree, targeting Gotham City's key political figures, billionaire Bruce Wayne is called into action donning the iconic cowl as he begins to investigate. As Bruce explores the deep-rooted corruption hidden behind some of Gotham's most well-known figures, the full scale of the sadistic serial killer's plan comes to light, forcing Bruce to question his past as he tries to save the city of Gotham and its people.\n\n\u2018Dune' cinematographer Greig Fraser adds to his stellar streak of work, providing \u2018The Batman' with sensational cinematography, creating a gothic feast for the eyes while also capturing the dark underbelly of Gotham City. Fraser's visuals allow for this film to be not only a visual spectacle, but also a thoroughly entertaining film. Much like James Mangold's \u2018Logan' or Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, \u2018The Batman' positions itself as one of the darker superhero adaptations \u2013 both thematically and narratively, as well as visually. Acclaimed composer Michael Giacchino crafts a magnificent score for the film, creating an addictive mix of booming orchestral pieces and eerie choir pieces. Giacchino's new theme for the caped crusader, an intense and thundering piece of music will arguably go on to define the character for years to come.\n\nDespite the hefty near three-hour run-time, Matt Reeves ensures that audiences are kept on the edges of their seats and entertained throughout. Robert Pattinson slips effortlessly into the role as the iconic hero, giving a marvellous performance as an intimidating hero, and mysterious billionaire. Pattinson's performance leaves you eagerly anticipating for when the \u2018Twilight' star next dons the emblematic cowl, with a portrayal that manages to capture Batman's humanity so easily and subtlety.\n\nPaul Dano arguably gives the best performance of the film; crafting himself into a terrifying villain, lighting up every second of screen-time he gets. Dano and Pattinson's performances are accompanied by a slick turn as Selina Kyle/Catwoman from \u2018Big Little Lies' star Zo\u00eb Kravitz, who gives a brilliant performance as the feline anti-hero. However, Colin Farrell's unrecognisable turn \u2018The Penguin' can't help but feel like an unnecessary addition to the plot, coming off as a character who's only reason for being included was to set up the character's own HBO Max miniseries currently in the works.\n\nDespite being one of the best films of 2022 so far, \u2018The Batman' can't help but suffer from a few issues, including a disjointed third act that ultimately wins you over with a nail-biting final sequence and certain . Matt Reeves threads together a wide web of themes in \u2018The Batman' ranging from justice, corruption, to crime and greed. These complex themes come together to create a cryptic, intricate, and multi-layered story that keeps you on your toes, constantly guessing these character's next moves. \u2018Planet of the Apes' production designer James Chinlund and \u2018Spencer' costume designer Jacqueline Durran bring their respective talents together to create an immersive world that draws you into the crime-ridden streets of Gotham.\n\nMatt Reeves puts his spin on the iconic hero with Warner Bros. latest edition to their plethora of DC films. Driven by a cast that give marvellous performances throughout the three-hour run-time, \u2018The Batman' presents a much darker and mysterious version of the well-loved hero to audiences, inviting them to try and solve The Riddler's mystery alongside Bruce Wayne. The film does a stellar job of not only establishing new versions of these characters, but also sets up the future of Robert Pattinson's turn as Batman. Teasing new villains and exciting returns, \u2018The Batman' is sure to be a film that audiences will absolutely enjoy, whether you're a DC fan or not.",

If you never watched Seven (1995), do yourself a favor and go watch, one of the best thrillers/crime movies of all time. \nThe Batman movie tries to be dark and realistic, like Seven, and it is at times, but when it involves the main cast, some of the realistic approach is tossed aside or does not apply to them, it lacks consistency and can get annoying (specially the final battle/scene), you never really fear for Catwoman or Batman, because you always know they will be saved and the realistic rules shown don't apply to them. Also, it gets annoying that you are left with this feeling of \"there's too many ending scenes\", you think the movie is ending at least 4 times, something does not feel right.\nOverall, The Dark Knight (2008 - PG13) still the best Batman movie, being consistent, filled with great acting, music and story. The Batman (2022) is a 6.5/10 for me, it's a decent movie, passed the time, good acting, but not a great story, fell short on mystery/investigation, feeling too long (too many ending scenes opportunities) and lacks consistency on the dark/realistic approach.",

            "content": "The Batman does more right than wrong, but it's a touch overindulgent at very nearly 3 hours. This film, as anticipated, serves as a sort of showcase for an upcoming series of films, introducing several noteworthy names throughout the first chunk of the film. Catwoman, Penguin, The Riddler, and that's to say nothing of the less flashy but just as crucial Alfred Pennyworth or the Police Lieutenant, not-yet-Commissioner Jim Gordon. More characters work than do not, but it would have been nice to see a little development, especially for Paul Dano's transfixing take on The Riddler. Completely unhinged, but also calculating Dano's work as the deeply disturbed Edward deserved more screen time without his strange and haunting mask. This Riddler is nothing like the ones you've seen before, and Dano's take is certainly the best Batman villain since Heath Ledger's infamous offering. By the film's conclusion they do give him a backstory, but it's done in a real \"fly by\" sort of way. The backstory itself is nice and cookie-cuter neat so that it fits in the small window of time allotted for it. Ultimately it doesn't do the film's best character justice, but the performance is still commendable regardless. As for the rest of the cast, they do a fine job - no major complaints, but the film certainly does it's utmost to keep Batman onscreen by keeping Bruce Wayne off of it. While Pattinson does fine behind the cowl, his Bruce Wayne leaves something to be desired. Perhaps the most complete character in the film is Gotham itself. Here the backdrops are all dirty and unkempt, strewn with litter and soot. It rains more often than not here, casting the entirety of the city in a looming hopelessness that's almost palpable. It serves as a constant reminder of the mindset of the people who live there, surrounded by crime and wealthy exuberance, unsafe and too poor to combat the obvious corruption within Gotham's inner workings. This is perhaps best exemplified by John Turturro's transfixing take on Carmine Falcone, a well-known mob boss in Gotham city. Turturro, like Dano, doesn't get the screen time he deserves, but manages to do a lot with the limited time that he is allowed. The story represents a more detective-based approach that was often lacking a certain authenticity in Nolan's trilogy, which is quite welcome overall and it fills the lengthy runtime fairly well as The Riddler leads Batman all over Gotham chasing clues while playing a \"Saw-like\" game. Overall the package is entertaining enough to recommend, even if one has to clear an entire afternoon or evening to digest it all and the setup at the very end of the movie promises a sequel that could live up to the well-rounded entry we have here.",

Also what they did to riddler was just a sin he wasn't even riddler at that point because they tried to make him to realistic because riddler is not some psychotic serial killer he is supposed to be heavily narcissistic and just obsessed with proving he is smarter and better than batman not to mention the terrible design he, Catwoman, joker, and basically everyone in this movie suffered from.

So down the road, I finally had a way to watch this move for free. To be honest, this is the first Batman move I got bored with the movie. I literally go into about 40min of the move and turn it off and play video games. The reason why this movie was so bad because Bruce Waynedid not feel like character it post to be. When I think of Bruce Wayne as a dc character. My mined pop up as a playboy, with a lot money. Also a strong business man who hold his family name proud, but with family trauma. With this new Batman, Bruce feel like goth kid. Who care about nothing, like just not feel right about character. When Bruce wear the Batman suit, it feel like not really like a Batman. Like that one scene where he walk in the street to going into a club. Wtf, no Batman would do that, he would give though the roof or a window and threat the big bad boss. Not fight in middle of club where people are dance. Also, his bat cave feel like a problem kid who does not care about life. Plus, is equipment feel like cheap. Then when introduced cat women, I was disappointed because the cat women did not look right to me. She look like person that struggle to make a living in Gotham City. When cat women should be a successful theft who steal very rich items. I do not even know how they mess up this character. Plus, do not get me started on James Gordon.  Those when I do think about James Gordon. I think of a guy who is smoking while drinking alcohol. Overall, I do not know how this move got such good review. Maybe these people never grow up with Batman or seen cartoon movies or read the comics books.",

The broody and contemplative Batman is balanced with a flirty and sensual Catwoman, and the villain in the Riddler is malign, twisted and sinister.\n\nThe Batman is a riveting start at Matt Reeves and Robert Pattinson's iteration of the titular character, and should leave audiences wanting more from this Batman.\n\n9/10",

I think that it adds to the story really well and is realistic, considering Thomas Wayne was an extremely rich person, you kind of have to be a bit ruthless to acquire that amount of wealth in the first place. I also liked how batman said to Selina that Anika getting killed was sort of her own fault because she got in with the wrong crowd. I think that him saying something like that was very realistic, considering he grew up very rich and privileged. I'm really excited to see the next movie and see how the story progresses, and hopefully we will get more info Batman's parents past as well. I do think it is a bad idea putting joker in the next movie though, because there has been so many live action portrayals of the joker recently.

            "content": "The Batman (Directed by seasoned veteran director Matt Reeves) is the latest take on the iconic superhero played by Robert Patterson. The result? Very respectable if not flawed.\n\nThe movie doesn't reach heights of greatness attained by Chris Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" but is more on par with something like \"The Dark Knight Rises\" in my view. The movie is dark, very dark, as in visual tone, and it's obvious that wasn't a mistake by the director. Robert Patterson plays the part low-key, sad, and brooding.\n\nThe movie's main villain \"The Riddler\" is (no surprise) unhinged and depraved but very intelligent, played fantastically by Paul Dano. Dano plays the sociopath to perfection and is one of the highlights of the film.\n\nI enjoyed the main storyline for the most part with John Turturro as Carmine Falcone, Colin Ferrell (completely unrecognizable) as The Penguin and Zoe Cravitz does fine as Catwoman. I also can't forgot Jeffery Wright as Gordon, who does a great job and adds to the movie greatly.\n\nThe move in my opinion only suffers from one thing and that's bloat. The movie is 3 hours long and was trying to fit a whole lot in that 3 hours, which for the most part was OK because it was entertaining. However the movie would of benefited from a little less cramming and run time.\n\nAll in all if you're a Batman fan you definitely need to check it out. It's not an all-time great Bat-flick but its worthy of praise and and even if you're not a comic book fan a good thriller with some top notch performances.\nhttp://themoviepad.com",

Many of the action scenes are too darkly lit and slow paced, and murky, foreboding doesn't equal deep and thoughtful filmmaking. The Riddler is basically just Heath Ledgers scenes from TDK in those filmed news clips. Dano's non-stop screaming and yelling is just boring and doesn't equal deep and complex. I was expecting him to really embody The Riddler, but we just get a screaming dude dressed like The Zodiac. OK, he has some riddles to throw Batman off, but nothing mind blowing or compelling really. Nothing thoughtfully written. Most roles in this movie are also really miscast and we get more of the same that was some of the weak points of the Nolan trilogy (the few there were), where the comic characters are too real life, let's get back to some Batman Forever kind of comic embodiment of the characters, but yes, with a darker spin. I want to see the green Riddler costume, but with characteristics that will really creep me out. I hope they can just give Batman another rest for a while, think 1997 to 2005, and then redo him the right way.",

I watched this movie in 4K today and it looked beautiful. The visuals matched the cinema experience. The cast of this movie is stacked with big names such as Robert Pattinson, Colin Farrell and Paul Dano! The best Batman movie I've ever seen, yes better than The Dark Knight in my humble opinion. The opening scene to this movie is still one of the best openings I've ever seen to a movie. The only downside to Robert Pattinson's Batman is his version doesn't give the Bruce Wayne side justice. Don't get me wrong his Batman is perfect as he embraces the detective side of Batman but I can't say the same about Bruce Wayne. Anyways I adore this film but it doesn't hold up the same way as the first watch does.

            "content": "There is no better way than to start 2023 than listening to Robert Pattinson mumble something about fear and vengeance to nobody at all again. Possibly the darkest interpretation of Batman we've ever had, and I don't think anybody is complaining. Matt Reeves takes inspiration from basically any David Fincher film you could think of to create a gripping and intense film that explores Gotham in a new way. Instead of creating an ultra-realistic city, like Christopher Nolan, or an ultra-cartoonish city like Tim Burton, Mett Reeves builds a dark and grim city - much like something out of Se7en. The Batman tears almost every layer of cartoonish fun away, and replaces it with psychological thriller and crime noir. And it pulls it off in magnificent fashion. While Pattinson's Bruce Wayne is not on the level of Christian Bale, his Batman strives to new lengths and achieves something nobody else could have done. His sombre and brooding performance as Batman stands out in a film full to the brim of outstanding performances.\n\nThe soundtrack adds to the moodiness of this film, with Nirvana's \"Something In The Way\" seemingly now the theme song of Gotham. It's hard to decide whether the use of that song is as good as the score though. We've always known Michael Giacchino is a master in his craft, but I have a feeling this could later become known as his magnum opus. An absolute robbery from the academy by the way. As I've said before, it's to decide whether this is actually better than The Dark Knight, but even if it isn't as good, it absolutely comes as close as anything else. The costumes and makeup department had their work cut out here, but they certainly delivered. The mix of CGI and practical effects absolutely works here, and I'm sure this will hold up many years from now. Despite being a new take on batman, this really is faithful to the comic books, bringing us the detective batman in a fresh light. Although this is set at the start of batman's career, it's not an origin story. As much as I like origin stories, this excels because Matt Reeves knows and accepts the people watching this as not stupid. No need to have flashbacks to Wayne's parents death - he knows that we already know what happened. The prime example of this is in one of the first scenes, when Batman is investigating a crime scene and he sees the son of the victim. All we needed was a sorrowful look and we understood his feelings.\n\nVerdict: \ud83c\udfc6 97%\nThe Batman achieves a new take on Gotham and the caped crusader, with one of the bleakest comic book films ever created. It's looks, sounds and feels like the detective thriller we were all excited for. At almost 3 hours long, it's certainly not a short outing, but its relentless nature never releases you from it's grip and somehow leaves you already impatiently waiting for a sequel.",

Instead, I caught it on a small, probably 7 inch screen mounted on the front seat in an eight hour economy flight to somewhere. I'd tell you, THAT was a pretty bad experience. AND I don't mean the economy seats OR the bad resolution on the screen. Firstly, it was a VERY LONNNNNNNNNNNNNNG movie of non-stop action, explosion and of impossibility. I'm sure watching it on the big screen will bring the \"explosions\" and \"action\" more to life, BUT I wasn't disappointed with those. I had pretty low expectations before I caught this in the flight. I just didn't expect it to be THAT BAD...\n\nSee, story telling is very important. Not every reboot needs an origin story, I AM FINE with this one not having an Origin story. What I DO WANT is some originality in story telling. \n\n\"But hey Dude, there's nothin' wrong with a little copying of a good formula, eh?\"\n\nIt came across as too much of a The Dark Knight wannabe, plots after plots, explosions after explosions, madness after madness..... But let me share WHY \"The Dark Knight\" is on whole different universe of quality (Chris Nolan aside). It has layers to it, development of the story. The Joker didn't single-handedly set all his plans RIGHT AT THE GET GO. He had to create layers of chaos, destroy many people and groups to grow his legend and force the mob to bend to his will and work with him. And Bruce Wayne/Batman had to burn bridges and be as ruthless as him in order to defeat The Joker and save Gotham, and then some,.... became an Outcast at the end. It was good story telling and Heath Ledger was so convincingly MAD, CHAOTIC and EVIL that he'd give you nightmares for weeks.\n\nThe Batman on the other hand, gave you a SUPPOSED same level genius, madness and chaos in The Riddler. Sure, they introduced many other characters from the Original Batman comic stories, but they were shallow, without much focus or character development. AND the real problem was... The Riddler ALREADY had ALL his plot and plan in place BEFORE the movie even began. It was ALL plotted, disaster equipment ALREADY IN PLACE, and BOOM!, no one knew and no one came close to discover anything until everything has happened, and if The Riddler haven't already planned it to be caught, no one would even discover who he is. and Boom, BOOM, BOOOOOM! Layers after layers of chaos happening one after another without so much as a development to HOW those Chaos came about. ALL ALREADY IN PLACE. And grand finale of another 30 minute of chaotic fight sequence where The Batman with very little help defeats all the baddies. \n\nIn The Dark Knight, many things had to happen to lead to its conclusions, for example, the Ferry portion, where the the people of Gotham CHOSE not to kill the other, not to pull the trigger and leave the destruction if any to the perp, not falling into The Joker's plan. In The Batman, it's just boom, Boom, BOOM.... no control whatsoever, such shallow PLOT development. \n\nI think t he biggest sin is that they TRIED SO HARD to be The Dark Knight, but in my book, failed miserably. Also, I don't like OR dislike the actors/artists in this movie. I KNOW WHO they are, but have neither positive nor negative feel about them. They sort of played the character \"Well\" I guess, but nothing stood out. They also seem to lack chemistry, to me. Had The Batman NOT PRETEND to be The Dark Knight so hard, instead gone with another method, perhaps I would've enjoyed it more. Hence even more, not one to be watch on a flight.",

They are used well. But it is a villains movie with the unrecognisable Colin Farrell as the Penguin (why???), John Torturro as Carmine Falcone (wonderful) and Paul Dano (steals the last 30 minutes) as the Riddler that make it worth watching. I won't give away the plot, but the Riddler is 4 steps ahead of everybody including Batman, and he is the reason the plot is over complex and yet delivers. \n\nThe writer/director Reeves establishes his own murky world and somehow pulls this off. Tonally, it is more The Joker than Dark Knight and if it was 30 minutes shorter and a tad brighter in look and dialogue (a struggle sometimes) this would be one of the best Batman films.

The intermingling of superhero and and Goodfellas style mafia drama was also unexpected. The Batman is by no means a perfect movie and it has its weak parts, such as the plot being quite linear and neither Batman himself, Zo\u00eb Kravitz in her role as Catwoman or any of the villains being all that memorable. Will we remember Paul Dano as The Riddler in 20 years time, or Colin Farrell as the Penguin? Perhaps not is the answer, as much as I was dumbfounded upon first finding out that Farrell was actually the Penguin. Having said that, there is a certain flow to the movie that kept me enthralled and engaged, and this feeling only increased as the flicked got closer to its climax, and this is the reason for the 3.5 star rating.",

This film has little premises on Nolan's take, strictly for the lazy soundtrack, writing and character development arc. I'm rich so I can build a super car, I'm rich so I'm a super fighter. The painful lack of merit to ability leaves a hollow emo character who can't present a tangible reason for why he did what he did and why, apart from the fact that he's spiteful and ungrateful. Or even present a reason to be liked by the audience. \n\nAs a rule of thumb I believe the batman should display some kind of signal of hope, a struggle of redemption, someone who doesn't take advantage of what we know to display his strengths, instead leading by example in the mysterious dark ways of his own individual battle with morality. \n\nThis portrayal lacks in that and lacks in the role model aspect just as much. \n\nPerhaps if the movie was 40 minutes shorter, specifically while Batman is holding the flare and leading the people through the flooded arena, boom, perfect cut, movie over.  6/7--10 maximum",

And then there is another scene with the same thing later. \nThe villains appear to be pretty much from the Nolan movies just a bit different, which could be a good thing. Compared to most of the characters, the Penguin is at least likable, even funny at times. Also, the riddler's cast appears to be a great choice with his weired smiley child like face but then the character just drowns within the mediocrity of the rest of the movie and his own flat story. The heroes, portrayed by good actors, appear boring, flat and I could not care less about any of them. The movie very much lacks chemistry between the characters. \nThe car chase was at least entertaining - with probably a high collateral body count for a hero who does not kill - and ending in a cinematic eye candy upside down shot in the end. \nThe rest of the movie however just seems like a person with brain injuries who wants to tell you something but forgot how to speak. So you keep waiting patiently for three hours. I believe the movie tries hard, too hard. I think it wanted to be somewhere between The Dark Knight and Silence Of The Lambs, but then was stuffed with way too many unconnected chunks of story, that all feel like you have seen them before, and finally hardly becomes a movie of its own.",

He's a guy in a suit pretending to be riveting but only delivering heavy handed soliloquies to characters as vacant as himself. His villain is as lost, and only shows himself to be less riveting than the score and stage he's set upon. The highlight of the film is a scene that depicts an explanation of a world we feel little about. With a song by Nirvana, a band we seldom recognize but should give praise where it's due. That scene is 20min's in, and trust me, it goes down hill from there. The exposition of characters here is starkly exasperated, trying so much more than the simple plot they play along. You may find yourself unimpressed and falling asleep at what's supposed to be a riveting version of your favorite masked super.

Yet with this film, we are miles and miles away from Tim Burton's goofy, gothic iteration of the iconic caped crusader. And perhaps that's where this movie falters. It is a little bit too committed to its tone. It is all darkness, without a speck of light. And while that ambition is respectable, ultimately it lacks the much needed levity of Burton and Nolan's films. \n\nThe character development of the titular hero is also severely lacking. We find out little about him at all, other than the fact that he is like a My Chemical Romance version of Bruce Wayne and a very inexperienced, more vulnerable presentation of the character we know and love.\n\nPaul Dano absolutely crushes this uncharacteristically frightening take on The Riddler. \n\nAnd the movie is far too long and meandering. \n\nSo it is an ambitious, respectable start but it is seriously flawed and a little too committed to its crushingly macabre atmosphere.",

He did what he could. Shot primarily during lockdown (where most filmmakers thought they didn't have to follow sheep) and came out well. Edited in was loads of rain and nightfall, where they struggled with the pace and conviction was when the rain wasn't bouncing. Perhaps nobody noticed. Just think was sloppy in places and a bit flat. They depended too much on the editing. Hope the next one offers more, less flashing lights and not overly fixated on some strange character who gained fame like many through the internet trolling.",

And I will say...I was very presently surprised. I have always loved Batman but the movies have never fully done it for me. I think that the Batman movies that try to be silly are better than the ones that try to dark and edgy. The LEGO Batman Movie is hilarious and I re-watch it all the time. This movie however is very good. The cinematography is beyond incredible. The music is awesome. The acting is beyond compare. The scene directing is just perfect. When Batman first came in, I truly felt like something amazing was happening before my eyes. It was so powerful. This film actually does dark and edgy well. The shots are just memorable, and I still remember them. The story is written pretty well, while still having flaws. But overall this film does so much that excites you. I walked out of this theater and immediately knew what my new favorite superhero movie was. I highly recommend you to watch this movie. My only large complaint is that Robert Pattinson, does an Oscar worthy performance as Batman, but a pretty bad job as Bruce Wayne. This can also just be the writing but at least Bruce Wayne is in the movie for like 20 minutes so it's not that bad. Paul Dano is fantastic in this movie and when he is on screen I do genuinely get scared and uneasy. It is an easy 5 star.",

Other fantastic performances would be Colin Farrell as the penguin and Jeffrey Wright as Jim Gordon along with Paul Danno with his new iteration of the Riddler is truly terrifying. \nA few negatives I would give the film would be that I felt it was a tad to long and they could have cut out possibly 10 to 15 minutes, and I also feel that the film overall was too dark in color I really felt there should've been a few more shots of some light but other than the length of the film and over all color of the film The Batman is a damn near perfect Batman movie and definitely the best iteration of the character we have gotten in many years.",

If Batman is supposed to be the world's greatest detective you'd think he'd know what a carpet layer was. His standing around with police is not the enigmatic ninja he is in the comics. It made him look like an out of place goth kid at a preppy party. How he didn't break every bone from that fall in the flying squirrel suit I don't know. Things like that made this movie seem farfetched, unrealistic and unrelatable.  I hate to say it but Morbius was a better film in comparison.

Batman himself is dark, ominous, and compelling, feared by criminals and a force of reckoning. The action scenes are a sight of beauty and awe. Pattison also does a great job with the new portrayal of Bruce. The film excels in all these areas. It struggles, however, in falling victim to superhero tropes and lack of depth in its main characters, amongst an excessive run-time. Despite a progressive storyline, it seems unsure at times, and gives way to predictable 'superhero' cliches at times (IE the love interest). We also rarely get a feel of who Bruce Wayne really is, and don't get deep enough into the minds of Penguin, or even The Riddler. With the Zodiac inspiration, one might expect us to get a more intimate psychological view of the twisted menace terrorizing Gotham, yet we do not. And the Penguin is not much of a character at all. Perhaps in the sequel we will get to uncover more character depth, and see more of The Batman obliterating Gotham's seedy underbelly.",

            "content": "I thought the movie would somewhat live up to the bar that was set when Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dark Knight trilogy had set over a decade ago portraying Batman as a caped crusader we all needed. At the time no one expected much based on the previous takes on the worlds great detective from Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever, and Batman and Robin. I thought Batman vs Superman could have had a better story than what was portrayed. After seeing this movie my take away from it is that it\u2019s not better than the first portrayals of Batman, a little better than Batman vs Superman and no where close to the dark knight trilogy. How Gotham city was portrayed as a cesspool of crime and corruption was accurate to the comic books. The portrayal of Bruce Wayne as a dark depressed billionaire playboy comes nowhere near how Batman is to be portrayed. Bruce Wayne is supposed to be happy care free playboy billionaire with Batman as a dark and vengeful superhero. Both being portrayed as the same makes me wonder how no one in the city figured it out that they\u2019re one in the same. Plus it did not seem as if they feared Batman seeing how a drug deal went on in front of him and the criminals not thinking twice about it. Even flying in a wing suit instead of using his cape like in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight makes you wonder why have a cape at all. The fact that Batman had to think about catwomans offer to conduct deeds unbefitting to his character leaves disappointment on why Batman was born in the first place and the promise he made the day he was born on that very bad day. Penguins appearance is a much better improvement from Batman Returns. However portraying the riddler as somewhat of a good guy vigilante instead of a villain shows a very poor direction for the character. Even with his costume it does not bring the riddler to life of the movie villain many of us had admired for many years when he was introduced in the comics. Overall the movie has an accurate portray of Gotham but goes into disappointment on its presentation of its characters. ",

Do something, damn it!' They can say that he is still a newbie Batman, whitout enough experience, but good God, he felt so OLD and tired sometimes... And the long-long boring shots and meaningless slo-mos did not help. They should have cut half of them and than we would have had a nicer paced movie. \nAnd basically in this BATMAN movie Batman did not saved the day in time and did not solved any mistery in time. He was constantly late and SLOOOW...! Ugh. \nQuite a frustrating watch. \nBut maybe if it becomes its own \"series\" than it could be a good base for his improwement...

The length didn't necessarily bother me personally.  I hardly felt the runtime.  With that said, I do believe it could have been trimmed, tighter in some places.  It is darker than other Batman films, but not dark enough in my opinion (speaking to the tone and atmosphere, not the lighting (though that too is a bit on the dark side)).  What Matt Reeves has done with the character here, I quite like (emphasis on detective work and the seniority of Batman (2 years in versus just started or seasoned/old Batman).  Overall I felt The Batman was quite good (-surprising considering the saturation of this character in pop culture and film in the last decades).  I think that's why this installment works for me, it gives a side, albeit small, of this character that we haven't seen a lot of (detecting and fledgling but not new).  In my opinion, this film gives us the best Batman reveal/introduction I've ever seen.  Complaints:  I mentioned it previously, but the film was going for a darker, noir-ish atmosphere and story- I believe it should've either stuck with not showing darker scenes or circumstances or leaned heavily into them (as opposed to some grey middle road).  I'm not looking for really bloody or gory films per se, but the way some scenes are handled in the film gives it a bit of a neutered feel (and in some cases actually took me out of the movie).  In conclusion- The Batman is a film not without it's flaws (runtime, for some, \"tip-toeing\" around darker elements and market saturation), but overall (and again, surprisingly) I found myself really enjoying the movie.  Matt Reeves hasn't let me down so far and I'm excited to see what other fresh elements he'll bring to the table with this character as this new Batman series continues.",

Matt Reeves crafted a stylish, grungy, neo-noir detective story that fully delves into the psychology of the Batman character. Robert Pattinson is by far the most comic accurate portrayal of the caped crusader. We are finally getting a detective Batman who goes into crime scenes and investigates his surroundings and most importantly, DOESN'T KILL. Setting Batman's character into year two and having him learn from his mistakes by becoming a beacon of hope instead of vengeance was a brilliant move by Matt Reeves. I thought that Bruce Wayne being portrayed as a loner was a very interesting take on the character and fully made sense in the context of the story, but I do hope that he does become more of an extrovert in future installments. I also loved the fact that the Waynes aren't perfect and have made mistakes in their lives even though they are still good people. Paul Dano gives a chilling performance as a new take on the Riddler and him being inspired by Batman in a cruel and twisted way is something that we haven't seen a lot before and works wonderfully. Everyone else did a great job as their characters as well and fully complemented Batman's story. Greg Fraiser did a phenomenal job with the cinematography, and Michael Giacchino proved to us again that he has the potential to be the next John Williams with his score. I do think the backstory behind the Wayne's shady actions should've been explored a little more and I thought that the Joker cameo at the end was cool, but kind of derivative. Overall, it's a perfect Batman movie and a near perfect cinema experience. I would give it a 9.5/10 but RT doesn't allow that.",

The talent that Matt Reeves assembled for this one is beautifully apparent, from the set design to the cinematography (so many shots deserved to be paused and marveled at), casting to scripting (the script's frequent use of silence to convey meaning is masterful), and his direction is spot on. Easily one of the best Batmans out there, but the suffocating dreariness of it leaves me wondering how often I'll want to watch it again. \n\nAnd I have to ask - are we SURE that was Colin Farrell?",

I like how they finally write him being this very intelligent detective solving a mystery while still having that savagery nature of a vigilante. It was also a great writing choice to set the time of where Batman has just started his career, so we get to see him make mistakes and adapting from them. Oh and the score slaps hard, I mean this is Michael Giacchino were talking about here so you know its gonna be epic. The Riddler was a great villain and had a good motivation behind his plans, but I kinda wish we had more time with The Penguin, I really like how they made him more of this mob gang leader than a mutant human hybrid (don't take this the wrong way, I still love Danny DeVito's Penguin). I guess the car chase makes up for that, and speaking of which, one of the best choreographed car chases I have seen since Baby Driver and probably the best Batmobile in my opinion. Lastly, I like to point out that I was so happy that this was a noir type film than a typical superhero action flick, don't get me wrong Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy is timeless but this had a unique style of pacing, writing, and choreography that I recommend this to anybody who likes the character Batman, or detective films in general.",

Matt Reeves is that kind of director.\u00a0\nBatman's \"rise\" ends up being his detriment to the character as a whole. It's clear that his incompetency is supposed to mirror the Year One narrative, but the script is idiotic and you end up finding out that this is actually year 2 and this isn't his first villain, yet Batman knows absolutely nothing about the criminal underbelly, how Gotham operates, what Wayne Industries is even about, and all his vigilantism is apparently tazing gangbangers in slums.\u00a0\nYou may say that this is the point. This is why there is no discernible difference between Bruce and Batman. There is no mask; he is just obsessed. But obsessed with what? Travis Bickle quickly realized that beating up pimps would not result in the removal of scum from the streets. Yet the \"greatest detective\" can't figure out who runs who, and needs the Riddler's trail of breadcrumbs? You can cuss on Zoe Kravitz's \"privileged white men\" line, but in the context of this movie, she is right. And Bruce is one of them.

It was a great new take on the Batman of Ego and the TV series when DC Comics was Detectives Comics, and it was a great way to showcase the Batman of the past.

I also liked the way the film was sublimated from the noir of the past to the motif of Batman in the end. And above all, the sense of heroism. It all started with Tim Burton. It was a reboot that was able to well redefine the \"batman\" films that were said to have been completed with \"The Dark Knight,\" such as what a hero is and the conflict between the police and the people.",

The DC Comics Extended Universe is not at the most significant point with their film quality being as inconsistent whereas the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been consistent in its quality and that quality being the best movies. Because of this, the WB is taking the time to make a good movie just not an extended universe by supporting independent stories, first with Joker and now with The Batman. At first, I was happy at the thought Robert Pattinson was going to replace Ben Affleck as Batman but I get this. But this movie, unlike the Batman movies in the DCEU, is phenomenal.\n\nSet in a world in which Bruce Wayne/Batman has been operating for two years and despite taking down criminals and the quiet support of the police things are just as bad as before, but in time, he realizes there is a reason. Several politicos are being hunted down by a serial killer with an affinity for puzzles and riddles and inspired by Batman to seek his brand of justice as all his targets are supposedly corrupt operating in Gotham City. This mystery killer sends Bruce around Gotham providing clues while he encounters foes and allies in his mission to find out what is going on leading to a phenomenal conclusion.\n\nThis was a great movie, slow, but it develops so well as a good mystery should be. In many ways similar to other Batman stories, like Long Halloween, Year One, and Earth-1. Many congratulations to a great cast as Robert Pattinson does a great job playing the role of Batman, although he doesn't play the hero and secret identity as well as his predecessors. I was wary of Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman believing her to have won this job via nepotism due to her stepfather. But I am happy to say that I was wrong, and do one better and say that she is the BEST actress to play the role. She doesn't physically resemble the character like some of her predecessors but she is more hard-hitting and emotionally stronger than all of them ever were. I enjoyed how this depicted the Riddler as a serial killer instead of the goofy killer/thief with a gimmick of riddles and puzzles. The rest of the cast was great, like Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon, Colin Ferrell as Oswald Cobblepot, James Turturro as Carmine Falcone, and Andy Serkis as Alfred. I can't wait for the sequel.",

Performances from everyone were great, especially Pattinson and Dano. One of the critiques I had of this movie was the 3rd act. The first 2 acts had a lot of great buildups, and it showcased a ton of the Wayne lore and did a really good job at showing the history of Gotham. I felt that the 3rd act fell a little flat but I liked the setup and the build-up to it, but the payoff didn't feel as satisfying as it should, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching this excited to see what else Reeves has next for Rob Pattinsons Batman.",

If I have any criticism towards this film it's that Robert's Bruce Wayne is lacking rn but to be fair since this is only his 2nd year as Batman that's all he has rn he is still laser focused on fighting crime rather than trying to live his life as Bruce Wayne like in The Dark Knight trilogy & the film sometimes is way to dark as in lighting so it can make fights or following Batman hard so you are going to have to turn up the brightness to see what's going on.",

Its a crime noir that sets a young Batman one the trail of a cryptic serial killer targeting Gotham's elite, and spirals into a game of cat and mouse as Batman learns how far the rot of corruption and crime sinks, and the lives of his allies and enemies flipped on their head with each new victim's death ending with a new revelation of Gotham's history and its supposedly paragons . \n\n\nIn contrast to the Synder films, Batman is actually a detective story that plays with some deconstruction of his tropes, rather than seeing him mindlessly murder people with guns and brand them with cattle irons like a psychopath. If you've ever seen Se7en, this film really emulates the grimy, sweaty, concrete jungle and neglected urban hovels where no where feels safe or comforting as closely as a PG13 will allow.   Thankfully, the film does have a healthy does of naturalistic humor and characterization. Its also the best looking superhero film from a cinematography angle, and a really striking use of light to make these really deep shadows and ominus lights.  Its serious enough to make a ominous killer thriller with exciting action, and when to remind us that these are people with some appropriate humor and small character moments. Acting is great too. Pattinson can emote really well with just his body and eyes, and basically everyone here ( except that cameo at the end )  is my new favorite on screen iteration of the Batman lineup.",

The Batman mixes elements from film noir, thriller (especially from the Seven movie) horror, and superheroes movie to distinguish itself from the franchise but also give what you are expecting from a Batman movie. This new approach fits perfectly with the Batman universe but it is also darker than any other live adaption iteration of the dark knight. The acting is top-notch especially from Zoe Kravitz as the femme fatale Catwoman, her charisma takes over every time she appears. Robert Pattison is also good at his job even if his Bruce Wayne is not what you expect, he is more of an angsty and reclusive Bruce with a slender figure which is very different from the usual bulky socialite we are used to knowing. One change I didn't like though was Alfred, the character here didn't have the typical sarcasm and lacked in personality. The story was good and using the Riddler as the main villain helped to bring the detective side of Batman, with enigma, investigation, and revelations. It's not perfect though as sometimes the pace would slow down, making the viewers less investing but, don't worry, it will pay off at the end. We also have to talk about the score, which is hauntingly good, and the breath-taking decor, between the gritty New Yorkesque Gotham and the gothic interiors of the Wayne Manor.",

With The Batman, long gone are the days of flash colours, bat nipples & cheesy one liners. This is a serious film, impactful, memorable and impossible to take your eyes off. It's a very stripped back, down to earth movie, not rely on fancy special effects or over-elaborate set pieces. The characters don't spend their time trying to sound smart or out quip each other, they talk like regular people. The action, while not like anything you'll to see on a day-to-day basis, is very grounded and believable. The premise of a man dressing up in a costume to fight crime is treated with just the right amount of sincerity and gravitas. Robert Pattinson, an incredibly talented actor who's successful broken free from the sparkly vampire role many thought would define his career forever, spends more than 80% of his screen time not as Bruce Wayne, but as the caped crusader. He's not a billionaire playboy or hapless company owner, he's a dedicated crime fighter who only seems comfortable when he's donned the cowl and black makeup. As many have remarked, the film is more of a detective story than it is a superhero movie, and that's great. Rather than trying to outdo what previous instalments have done, Reeves has taken a character we're all familiar with and presented him in a different way. He's essentially a sleuth, a cop with more gadgetry and much less red tape, chasing down a criminal who is terrorising the city while also dealing with unsavoury characters from a seedy underworld. Paul Dano's Riddler is, sadly, too close to Ledger's Joker to not invite comparisons, and while his performance is great, there's nothing about his motivation or behaviour that's especially unique. The 3-hour runtime was daunting, but most of it passed by in a flash because I was so invested in what was going on. Sadly, the film loses steam in the 3rd act. There's still some interesting things going on, but it feels like the film built to an organic climax, then struggled to find anywhere to go afterwards. But there's a reason people are calling this the next great Batman film. Its intense, its epic in scale, has a beautiful aesthetic, likeable characters and a killer lead performance. A sequel is apparently in the works, and if its anywhere near as good as this, I'll be first in line to see it.",

And that translates his Batman into something more complex. He isn't so much a superhero, as he's kind of a scary weirdo. What redeems him is Zoe Kravitz's breathtaking, damaged Catwoman.

            "content": "Throughout his film career, Director Matt Reeves (\"Let Me In,\" Planet of the Apes series) has explored a variety of issues:  the sense of being \"other,\" the corrosive effects of alienation and whether the desire for vengeance is an integral part of human nature.  \"The Batman\" covers this territory, too.\nCo-written by Reeves and Peter Craig (\"The Town,\"  \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay\"), this film begins when Bruce Wayne/Batman (Robert Pattinson) has been a vigilante crime fighter for two years.  After the Mayor of Gotham City is brutally murdered, Batman works with Lieutenant Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) to identify the killer and uncover his motivation.  Along the way, Batman is required to confront the corruption of Gotham, where city officials are much more interested in self-dealing than improving the metropolis.  Eventually, he discovers that the core of the civic corruption may be closer to home than he thought.\nThe cast is excellent.  In addition to Wright and Paul Dano as The Riddler, John Turturro makes a charismatic appearance as crime boss Carmine Falcone, Peter Sarsgaard has a brief, explosive role as the corrupt District Attorney and Colin Farrell, unrecognizable beneath prosthetics and a fat suit, is a criminal-in-training as The Penguin.  Zoe Kravitz is a sexy Selina Kyle/Catwoman with her own troubling past to explore. (She apparently prepped for this role by voicing the Catwoman role in 2017's \"The Lego Batman Movie.\")  I hope that everybody who remains alive will reappear in later episodes of this intended trilogy.  \nWith this first installment, Reeves has taken the Batman franchise in a very different direction from its predecessors.  His goal appears to be exploring the depths of film noir (cynical heroes, stark/dark lighting, intricate plotting, and existential issues).  This Batman is a brooding loner driven by vengeance, but self-aware enough to journal his thoughts, writing to give voice to his misgivings about life and his role in it, since there is nobody around to talk to.  After \"The Lighthouse,\" this is a relatively upbeat role for Pattinson.\nTwo things about this Batman don't work.  First, the venal corruption of public officials is so consistent that the viewer eventually assumes that every character's sole motivation is self-interest.  That's too cynical, even for me.  Second, as The Riddler's followers prepare for the film's climactic scene, they debate online what type of weaponry to deploy.  For me, observing an online chat where disgruntled terrorists debate \"what gauge\" rifles to deploy was art imitating life much too closely.\nThis Batman is sober, somber but still very worthwhile.  It forcefully confirms the thesis that power always corrupts.",

'The Joker' can't resist the temptation to give its sympathy to its main character, making that film morally compromised.\n\n'The Batman' instead gives a firm basis for Batman's famous rule against killing, for once you take the step of passing mortal judgment on those you deem guilty, the urge develops its own momentum. For the Riddler, the city elites and crime bosses are only at the top of the list, but everyone else in Gotham is complicit and therefore fair game.\n\nBatman's restraint makes him not a villain, but an antihero. Though the film puts too fine a point on it, Bruce Wayne realizes that his initial passion for vengeance is expressed in its logical extreme by monsters like the Riddler. The Batman stands just on the far side of legality, as a vigilante, but that cardinal rule is how he maintains the balancing act, without becoming exactly what he hates.",

Everyone whispers so quietly, only for the very next scene to have BLARING engine noises, or gunfire, or something, that threaten to damage my TV that it's basically unwatchable. I am tired of films doing this. If you, as a filmmaker, are going to be too lazy to remix your sound for the home market tot he point where the film's essentially unwatchable then enjoy the hurt overall score. I'd score it lower if I could.",

            "content": "To be honest, this is a really good movie. Hang on? So why did I only give it 2 out of 5 stars? Well, this is really personal but, to me, it is not a good Batman movie. I really had problems writing this review because it is a very good movie. I just did not like it as a Batman movie.\n\nThe movie is really dark, gritty and noir. Not really a problem. It works for some movies. But it is also quite slow at the beginning and the first quarter of the movie was actually boring. Remember, this is a three hour movie so a quarter is more than half an hour of \"boringness\".\n\nThe \"boringess\" was broken up by a pretty cool car chase. Some people seem to not really like the batmobile and I have to say that it was not very inspired but it was not all bad either. Unfortunately the movie turned rather boring for a while again after that.\n\nThe movie tries to bring out more of the detective part of Batman than the previous movies, which is fine, but there is just too much moping around with Batman / Bruce Wayne walking around oozing sadness all around him.\n\nActually, this brings us to my main gripe with this movie. The choice of actor for the Batman is just wrong for me. He is more like a sad puppy than the Batman. The script that makes him mope around, have emotional outbreaks and, occasionally, being downright stupid like just staring dumbfounded when explosives go off in his face does not really help of course.\n\nTo me the Selina Kyle character had more charisma than the Batman, especially when the Batman was in his Bruce Wayne alter ego.\n\nAnd I really, really dislike that twist about Bruce's parents. That was such a lazy Hollywood writer hack thing to do just to create (unwanted) drama.\n\nThen we have the Riddler. Compared to the charismatic villains that we have come to expect he is just a sad little psychopath with a bunch of equally sad fanatical internet followers.\n\nNow, all of this would have worked great if it had been a movie about some, unspecified, vigilante. The movie is really well done. The detective story, the action (especially towards the end) and the noir setting would have worked great. Even at its three hour bloated length it would have been great although cut down to two hours or a bit more would have been even better. If it had not been a Batman movie!",

I DO like that the Batman character is the moody, serious, tortured type. So he doesn't have to be Thor. BUT the script can't treat the audience like we're six years old. Details and plot pints that should be left for the reader to unravel / put the puzzle pieces together are simply stated by the characters.  Instead of me saying to myself \"ohhhh! That character is going to help someone else, because of X\"\u2026 a character simply says \"you are going to help me, because of x\".  There is a cipher used repeatedly, yet the audience (and the characters, apparently) have to do no actual work to solve it. It just gets solved instantly!\n\nSo to be clear, my negative review isn't because I dislike the heavy noire feel here \u2014 rather, it's more that these talented actors were WOEFULLY UNDERUTILIZED - they all seem as though they are sleepwalking through the movie (does Gotham have sleeping pills in its water supply?) and, must of all, because the audience's intelligence is insulted by spoon feeding us pretty much everything? \n\nIt makes an already long movie feel even longer, since you're not engaged in the story,  since everything is explained to you \u2014 every \"mystery\" presented is solved waiting minutes (or seconds!) of being introduced. \n\nBooo.",

Then the guy says \"no.\" And closes the door on him. THAT'S not Batman!! Batman would've just appeared in Penguin's office, dragged him outside, and held him over the edge of a building until he told him what he wanted to know.\nI get that this is supposed to be an inexperienced and fledgling Batman, but he contributed nothing to the story. Why was he there? Who did he stop? He didn't stop riddler, riddler flooded the city, shot Falcone and shot the lady. He didn't even really stop the joker gang guys at the beginning. He beat them up but then he just let them go. What did he think they were going to do, promise to be good boys and never do crime again? They probably went and murdered someone else. If he was so brutal, why didn't he kill them? He didn't seem to have a problem with letting other people die. He let that one guy get blown up and he threw a metal bat at another guy's head.\nThis movie sucked.

I'll be honest I'm not a big fan of Robert Pattinson and when I heard he had been cast as Bruce Wayne I was a little confused, after watching the film I was silenced. He gives us a dark, moody and compelling Batman, being a younger actor he was also able to show us a different period of time of Bruce's life. To be honest I cannot fault a single member of the cast, everyone gave a great performance, especially Colin Firths penguin and Andy Serkis Alfred. But without a doubt Paul Dano's riddler stills the show, with a change on the original camp, goofy versions of the character. Paul's riddler is dark and demented, almost too realistic, there isn't one scene where you don't feel on edge with him. My only complaint would be the soundtrack, although Nirvanas \u2018something in the way' is a great song it was way overused and almost felt like they didn't have any of music in the film. Although the Dark Knight and the Dark Knight rises stand above this film, I'm excited to see if the next one can challenge for that top spot.",

One of the best examples of this is the fight in the dark hallway. The Arri cinematography is spot-on; I love the way Warner Bros. has been using Arri Alexas lately.\n\nBatman also learns that he can't just be fear, but hope for the city of Gotham. He realizes that he can't be so \"vengeful\" and violent all the time. If you are concerned about the violence in the film, I wouldn't worry so much; it is part of his character development.\n\nThe film places more focus on Batman's detective side, making it less of an action-packed thrill ride, so \"The Batman\" may not be for people who are more into fast-paced action. The mystery element is very strong and easily felt. And as for Michael's score, I am honestly still a little biased towards what Zimmer and Newton did for Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" trilogy, but it perfectly shows us the two sides of Batman: his heroic, lighter side, along with the realization that he has to represent hope for Gotham and not just fear, and his dark side, angry, bestial, and thirsty for vengeance.\n\nI would really recommend \"The Batman\".

            "content": "One of The Best Batman Movies EVER!\n\nIn this movie, Batman encountered several obstacles and adversaries throughout the film, whether it was the primary antagonist, The Riddler, or the side villain, the Joker Gang, who emerged at the film's outset. In this movie, director Matt Reeves demonstrates the many tactics utilised to represent Batman as a hero in a realistic world, a concept that parallels Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy's treatment of superheroes. Also, Reeves portrays The Riddler as a character who is inevitably wrecked by the city and its civilisation, which reminds people of another DC film, Todd Philips' Joker. \n\nHowever, the film's central theme is the transformation from darkness to light, or crime to justice. \n\nThe film deliberately mixes the good and the evil as a similar concept before breaking them apart at the end \u2014 a very smart move for Reeves to confuse the audience before revealing the real concepts as this action creates a much deeper impact on the audience. \n\nReeves conveys this main message by using the transition of colour from unsaturated to saturated, or darkness to light to contract evil with justice. \n\nA great example is in the scene of the murder of the mayor, he is watching television in the opening scene when The Riddler, featuring Edward Nashton, comes behind him and assaults him from behind, forcing the mayor to fall to the ground while The Riddler repeatedly strikes the mayor in the head with a carpet tool, executing him. The whole area was submerged in darkness. There was little light and crime occurred in the dark, which is an indicator of injustice (crime). The whole scenario sequence was filmed impeccably, from a camera behind The Riddler to a camera on the ground, which shows the blood-stained carpet tool as The Riddler drops it by accident, before walking up to it and picking it up off the ground. The camera pans seamlessly from scene to scene, unveiling The Riddler's horrific mask. The filmmaker also included sounds of The Riddler breathing to add to the already terrifying moment. Finally, the Riddler was apprehended and incarcerated in Arkham Asylum. Another allusion to the notion is that crime will always surface and justice will always arrive. \n\nFurthermore, at the close of Carmine Falcone's appearance, Batman catches him as he is exposed to the light and the police. The light was a symbol of justice, and Falcone would be held accountable for all the wrongdoings he perpetrated in this film\u2014torturing women and committing other crimes in the past.\n\nThroughout the film, the director's colour used\u00a0to shift from cold to warm, implying that Gotham, a city rife with crime, is ready to renew, redefine, and commit itself to justice; a true indication that Gotham is ready to change and turn for the better following the devastation caused by the Riddler in this film.  Though enemies would continue to return in the future, Batman established faith in this city, something in which the citizens of Gotham could believe, just as God created faith in the Christians. \n\nAnother clue is the portrayal of Batman's parallelism between terror and hope. In the scene where the Joker Gang chases down a guy on the verge of being assaulted at a train station, they were then alarmed by the sound of footsteps. They shifted their gaze to the shadows as a figure began to emerge. The Joker Gang made fun\u00a0of this Man-Bat figure as\u00a0it's Halloween and no one believes that a man dressed as a bat is going to do them any harm. The Joker Gang's leader approached him as the leader struck\u00a0the first punch. Batman grabs\u00a0it and slams him down with 10 strong punches. As Batman rose to his feet, the Joker Gang stood transfixed, and then\u00a0the first battle scene started. Batman defeats around 10 individuals while rescuing the guy from a beating. The whole action is filmed from several camera angles to convey how the Joker Gang members might feel while battling Batman. The sequence encapsulates the villains' terror for Batman and demonstrates how it develops in their thoughts. Again, justice was done in a far more visible manner than it would have been in the shadows. \n\nAdditionally, the similarity between Batman and the Riddler provides insight into this paradox. Batman, AKA Bruce Wayne, is the film's icon of justice, while The Riddler, AKA Edward Nashton, is the film's symbol of criminality. Both characters in this film spy on\u00a0individuals. While The Riddler is watching the mayor for an opportunity to attack, Batman is following\u00a0Catwoman, an anti-hero, seeking information and an answer to a crime. Both individuals watch others changing the world by their perceptions of what is just and righteous. \n\nToward the film's end, the Riddler-inspired criminal, dressed as the Riddler, embarks on a mission to assassinate the new mayor to fulfil The Riddler's stated aim \u2013 \"Unmask the truth.\" At the scene's conclusion, we glimpse one of the criminals. When asked who he is, he responds that he is vengeance \u2013 a well-known Batman catchphrase. This scene\u00a0re-defines what justice and fairness are in this film and shows Batman what some people have become due to his actions. It's a true point turner\u00a0and a philosophical point in the film. \n\nThe Batman movie challenges us to reconsider our idea of justice and if what we believe to be justice is indeed justice. \n\nIn this film, Matt Reeves has caught the spirit of both the antagonist and the hero. The Riddler, starring Paul Dano, depicts a less family-friendly riddler and a more cunning adversary. Batman, played by Robert Pattinson, reveals the true nature of vengeance and the power of terror in his hands. This figure exemplifies the words from Batman Begins,\u00a0\"As a man, I'm flesh and blood.\" I can be ignored. I can be destroyed. But as a symbol? As a symbol, I can be incorruptible. I can be everlasting.\" This is an outstanding Batman movie with the potential for a trilogy.",

How can you bring something new to the table after so many other adaptations of this character? For the most part The Batman succeeded in keeping him fresh by taking an approach that hasn't really been explored in previous movies. In comics Batman is known to be the world's greatest detective yet in the films they barely use his detective skills. Jumping right into year two without needing to do an origin story was also a smart approach as we the audience already know who batman and bruce wayne is, and know his background. I don't think I can sit through another edition of seeing Martha and Thomas wayne getting murdered in an alleyway. It's been done to death and I'm glad we didn't have to revisit it here . Robert Pattinson does a great job as the dark knight and has the longest screentime in the costume than any other actor has before. Batman is front and center and barely any time is spent with Bruce Wayne out of costume. This movie is perhaps the darkest batman movie to date, its gritty and takes a realistic approach even more than the Nolan trilogy. Although this approach may be off putting for some as even I wish they could find a happy medium and lean a little more into the fantastical nature of the Batman villan gallery. The riddler is a complete psychotic serial killer acting more like Jigsaw from the saw films and less like the riddler we know in comics. I liked Paul Danos performance  in this but it was a bit jarring to watch. Couldn't help but telling myself this isnt my Riddler. Collin Farrell as The penguin who is almost unrecognizable underneath all that makeup also gives a great performance. Jeffrey Wright is a natural fit to play commissioner Gordon. It's a solid cast and great acting from all. The fights deliver brutality like Arkham knight video games did. Although there is less action that you think there would be in a Batman film. There is some pacing issues and things kinda drag a little bit. Perhaps it's a little too self indulgent with a nearly 3hr running time. Im also a bit offended at the fact that Justice league snyder cut wasn't allowed a 3hr film for theaters yet here we are just a few years removed from that fiasco with a 3hr batman movie. This isn't the masterpiece that The Dark Knight was but for a first go round it's a valiant effort. It doesn't quite reach the epic heights it's clearly trying to reach for but its almost there. I think the third act kind of betrays what comes before it. I realize that it's a commercial films made for a massive audience but the final climax may not have been necessary, the film could have still had the same impact and shorter run time. Im intrigued in what a sequel will have to offer.",

The plot was boring and the Riddler was about as funny as aids.",

This dude was supposed to be like a Buckingham Palace butler at one point not some guy they found on the streets of Liverpool. Anyways the story is good, Pattinson was very good, action scenes were good just too few and far between and that's my biggest problem was the pacing.  For such a long movie the pacing was crazy slow, if they had trimmed about 20 mins off the movie it would have been much more enjoyable. Long movies are fine you just have to make sure you are using the proper pacing and keeping the audience engaged. That was a struggle for me during this movie.",

Pattinson does a good job as both Bruce Wayne and Batman, and Kravitz's Selina Kyle is one of the best versions yet. Aided by great fight scenes and an incredible chase sequence, an epic new Batsuit, and the best on-screen Riddler to date, The Batman is as good as promised.

The idea of the story about the Batman who must find out to the justice about the Zodiac Killer-type villain is pretty authentic, original, and pretty creative. For a creative film like this, you must praise the good qualities of what made this film so unique. The costume designs and makeup for Batman, Catwoman, Penguin, and Riddler were all pretty cool in their own unique ways. While I did not care for Robert Pattinson's performances as Bruce Wayne, I do give praise to Zo\u00eb Kravitz and Paul Dano. As expected for a DC film let alone a superhero film, you are able to see a lot of action sequences and visual effects. The Batman has a lot of epic sequences and visuals. Last but not least, Michael Giacchino deserves some praise with his original musical score that is really unique that makes your heart race. For a superhero movie like The Batman, it is more than just a superhero film. It is an original, creative, neo-noir film created by the brilliant Matt Reeves who gave us something that is original and impressive.",

Despite all this, this movie sets up an aspect of batman we have always known, the dark brooding man behind a cape, and it decides to follow it completely, never breaking this idea of who Batman is, but even though this is the case, it manages to show as a new aspect into Bruce Wayne's father, who is shown to be as corrupt as all the other leaders in Gotham, practically destroying the moral foundation of Batman's reason to fight crime. This was the best part of the movie, that and the occasional laughs and witty humour we got in the movie. Ultimately it was a pretty good movie.",

And that's just it, it's a remarkably tense Batman film with more in common with something like Se7evn than any other Batman films, even down to the nitty gritty detective work and very dirty crime scenes.  It's more a crime film than an action film, though the action is still sublime.

            "content": "After another watch I can finally comprehend and write a proper review so here we go:\n\nScore: Michael Giacchino does a phenomenal job with the score, creating tension, suspense and payoff all in one single track. The ambience built up by the gritty atmosphere is really good, and I like the religious and classical music played whenever the Riddler is present as it makes him feel even more warped as a twisted view on a Messiah. Also, one of my favourite songs is in this (Something In The Way) so added points there.\n\nCinematography: There are also a lot of biblical references in the shots, with references to Messiah's, The Seven Deadly Sins and Religious Quotes like the Ivory Tower reference (the shot is looking down on them). They also use colour or the lack there of to create atmosphere and make Gotham really gritty. It also makes The Batman more bat like due to the darkness or blurring they use to obscure him and make him seem more intimidating. The colour is usually pure white (or faded) or Red when it's used, with red referencing to the blood on their hands in the Iceberg Lounge that they cover up, and the white referencing religion once again as it's used in Church and to represent the Riddler as even more of a twisted Messiah; the white is also slightly faded to represent the tainted purity and how nothing, even religion, is innocent to the sins and punishment. They use close up shots to trap Bruce as Batman in his emotional state as he can't decide which of his two personalities to choose as Batman is slowly consuming his life. When he's fully Bruce, the camera pans out and he's always at the centre of attention, as his anxiety would likely take over his thoughts; When he's fully Batman, he's always off centre as he wouldn't want to be the centre of attention considering he's meant to be hiding in the shadows.\n\nActing: Robert Pattinson gives a career best as Bruce and Batman, as he manages to create a unique Bruce Wayne separate from the Playboy Philanthropist we've grown accustomed to, and also as a faithful representation of the Earth-1 Bruce he's based more closely off of. His Batman is also really good, and he's pretty intimidating with his physique and gritty voice, but whilst he's the best portrayal so far there's nothing super about it. However, Paul Dano is excellent in portraying a sadist, and his commitment to the role is extremely commendable and shows how versatile and brilliant his acting prowess is. Everything from his little to major actions make him so much more believable, and much like Robert Pattinson his voice is really well implemented to create a much more threatening character. Jeffrey Wright plays really well off of Robert and they have great chemistry with a very believable friendship and alliance that grows throughout the movie. Zoe Kravitz is also excellent and she's definitely a rising star if her career with this and Kimi continue to grow.\n\nPlot: The plot is really the shining point, and it does something that many have faltered whilst attempting: the three villain formula as The Riddler is still the central threat, Penguin is a very strong side villain who expands the crime aspects and he really does show a lot about the grittiness of Gotham. Carmine also serves well as a secondary villain but he's more of a catalyst for the climax and the setup of the Penguin TV show we're getting, even though he's played by the phenomenal John Turturro. I like how Matt Reeves focuses more on the crime neo-noir aspects rather than the formula that both the MCU and DCEU follow as that would've killed this. The detective aspects rival that of Zodiac, Se7en, and Chinatown and are very clearly inspired by those films and that's a good film as their approach is very successful. It's also surprisingly goofy with some unexpected jokes like the \"Thumb Drive\" one that still gets me everytime.\n\nThe Action: Batman doesn't kill. Thank God. For real though the car chase is the best in cinema and it gives me chills everytime hearing that engine roar. The fight scenes are all creative, and a minor bonus but I love when they incorporate the cape into his weaknesses as it'd realistic for it to be tossed around in combat. The hallway fight is a standout with beautiful visuals and a creative premise that was executed amazingly. \n\nThe best Scene: Will always be one of the final ones: when Batman is leading the civilians to safety in the water. Batman's character arc of realising that he needs to be a symbol of hope rather than fear is emotionally powerful and compelling, and it's everything that makes me love Batman in a single scene. The icing on the cake also has to be the narration over the top, as Robert Pattinson makes it all that better, even with the Nirvana song.\n\nThe one nitpick: The Joker scene is very rushed and feels forced for the sake of exposition, and they took out the other scene with Barry Keoghan's Joker and that one makes this a little better as it convinces me he'll be an actually good addition to the sequel.\n\nOverall: Matt Reeves killed it with this and I hope he continues to make this a franchise as I'd watch every single one he makes, continue killing it!",

Robert Pattinson is a great actor but the worst fit for Batman I've ever seen. I saw the ending coming at the start of the movie, and even then when I finally reached it it somehow managed to disappoint me further. Maybe it's the fact that all the antagonists seem weak and petty. This movie felt like an art project done by an emo college student. Except the college student has a mental disability.

It features the life of the masked vigilante during his second year of crime-fighting in Gotham City. Most of the cast delivered excellent performances. Robert Pattinson looked great as both Batman and his alter-ego, Bruce Wayne. Zoe Kravitz is a charming and gorgeous Catwoman. My friend said she looked like Jim Lee's version of Catwoman from the Hush comic book. Paul Dano's performance as a terrifying Riddler was just terrific. Everyone was saying that Collin Farrell looked so convincing in prosthetic makeup that you couldn't tell it was him. Jeffrey Wright and Andy Serkis were also great as James Gordon and Alfred, respectively. I love the cinematography and sound editing of the movie. It was quite an audio-visual treat. That new theme which played whenever Batman enters a scene sets the right mood. I expected the film to be dark and grim, which was appropriate. Everyone seems to love the fact that this new outing focused more on Batman as the brilliant detective that he is. Solving crimes and unravelling secrets, yet not short on action. It's a welcome change from the usual action-packed, CGI-laden superhero flicks. Overall, I love this new remake/reboot and I do hope this is a start of a new trilogy.",

            "content": "Easily my favorite adaptation of The Batman that is Kevin Conroy. Pattinson feels the most like a recluse Bruce Wayne while being intimidating Batman. Where some could play one or the other better. Though Affleck had the fake playboy and brutal Batman down pretty good. I digress this is about Matt Reeves and Pattinson's take for the character, and it's the version that I see of Batman in my head and grew up with on the animated series. The film is the most beautifully shot superhero movie in I can't remember. Yes it's dark in some scenes, but thats the character and the darkness that surrounds him in Gotham. Kravitz is the perfect Selina Kyle. She's eautiful, badass and cunning, and most of all she feels like Batman's equal. Jeffery Wright, I think surpassed the great Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon for me, yes some of you may say recency bias, but he's just that damn good. Being Batman's detective partner maybe my favorite scenes in the movie. Turturo is good, though he kind of feels miscast as the mob boss Falcone. Colin Ferrell unrecognizable in a ton of makeup, is particularly memorable in the few scenes he has. Can't wait to see what they do with him next. My main problem is The Riddler, he never felt like a threat. Though I did like the use of social media and how it can rise up the little freaks. It's a different touch you don't really see in these kind of films. Which is my favorite thing about The Batman, while still feeling like a superhero movie it's not trying to set up too much and expand its world. It's just Batman and the city of Gotham that it's worried about. Too many superhero movies just feel like the next chapter in a never ending ride, that just up and down, with the occasional loop or turn. I still enjoy those films, but their just in and out and forgotten about for me in a day. I loved that Reeves decided to go with the whole \"worlds greatest detective\" angle for Batman in this. That's always been my favorite aspect of the character. Sure there has been key moments in the past movies, but never the whole story like this. With it being kind of a cross between Zodiac, Seven and Manhunter it's a perfect slow burn combination. Even sitting at home it never felt it's run time, and I never got bored, it was paced beautifully. I cannot wait to see what Matt Reeves and co. have in the works for The Batman II, because this is gonna be hard to top.",

The batmobile chase scene is one of my favorite sequences from the movie. Gotham City feels very alive and familiar to the audience, something I feel hasn't really been accomplished in a Batman movie before. The ending shows the villain earn most of the satisfaction, but also shows the change in the public's perception of Batman - going from a terrifying vigilante to a signal of hope.

It had some great action scenes but it also focused a lot on Batman doing some detective work. Gotham has never seemed so shady and corrupt. That and I loved the ending. One of my favorite Batman scenes is from the animated cartoon Justice League Unlimited. Where Batman sits and holds a girls hand as she dies. The ending of this movie, showing Batman leading people to safety and assisting with rescue efforts was like a live action version of that scene. So many movie makers focus on Batman as the brooding and vengeful vigilante. They tend to forget to show that he can be compassionate.\n\nI wouldn't go as far to call him the best. But Robert Pattinson's Batman is easily on the same level as Michael Keaton's and Christian Bale's. My only gripes with him would be we don't see traditional Bruce Wayne with him. But it's literally relevant to the plot that he's obsessed with being Batman at this point. So we'll see where it goes from here. \n\nZoe Kravitz was amazing, I think she's the best Catwoman yet. Michelle Phifer and Anne Hathaway were good, but neither of them quite got the character right. \n\nPaul Dano is straight up nuts as the Riddler, and strikes a perfect balance of being kinda silly but very disturbing. \n\nOther notable performances. Jeffrey Wright is easily a close second to Gary Oldman as my favorite Jim Gordon. Playing  a Gordon that comes off like he's feeling the effects of fighting all the corruption but is still holding strong. \n Andy Serkis only had a couple of scenes. But felt like a fresh take on Alfred by showing a more strained version of Bruce and Alfred's relationship. But still with the familial connection. \nColin Farrell was unrecognizable as the Penguin. Both in looks due to the make up, and in terms of his voice. \n Then John Turturro as Falcone. All I can say is holy crap. I'm use to this guy as Agent Simmons from Transformers. As soon as I heard he was going to be in this playing mob boss Carmine Falcone, I got a little worried. Nope, he nailed it. Dude was pretty intense. \n\nOverall, amazing movie, not my favorite Batman movie (that's Batman Begins), but a good start to this new trilogy. Can't wait to see where it goes from here.",

That being said, The Batman didn't just make another \"gritty superhero\" movie, but created a much more realistic cast of characters and villains \u2014 I was even surprised they gave Batman (Robert Pattinson) bat ears and a cape for his outfit. \"Catwoman\" (Zoe Kravitz) just has lots of cats and slinks through the night like a feline, but never actually goes by the name of meows or some shit like that. \"The Penguin\" (Colin Farrell) just has a large, crooked nose and wears a tuxedo; \"The Riddler\" (Paul Dano) is a dark web psychopath, eons removed from Jim Carrey's characterization from 1995. While still a billionaire, the Bruce Wayne of Matt Reeves' movie is a soft-spoken recluse \u2014 Pattinson's got the chin, he's got the voice, is he going to get the girl? Keeping with the trend of movies in the past 10 years or so, the budding romance here takes a backseat to much of the plot, but doesn't disappear completely, which is where it should be. So often, romantic storylines are shoved into otherwise entertaining plots, which derails the experience. Like we are slowly introduced to each character, piece by piece, we are also presented with Gotham City, a villain in its own right \u2014 it's hard to argue that the villains of the Batman universe aren't products of their environment. Paul Dano's \"Riddler\" is the villain for 2022 and I was totally expecting a nod to his inspiration from Joaquin Phoenix's \"Joker\" (from Joker), but alas, these are different universes (try and keep up). Let's talk \"Joker\" (Barry Keoghan) \u2014 even more so than Batman, I felt like we needed less of a \"Joker\" portrayal here, but yet again, I was tickled with excitement from his quick appearance and potential one-two punch with \"the Riddler\" in the next movie. *Side Note* I did watch that deleted scene floating around the interwebs and think Keoghan will make a welcomed addition to the exalted \"Joker\" brotherhood. Even though it's three hours, the plot does move. However, I didn't fully understand what exactly went wrong and how Batman helped, besides moving people out of the flooding waters like a Coast Guardsman? Moreover, why was \"Riddler\" so upset? His plan was largely a success, he gained many followers to his cause, and he gave himself up, so it's not as if he was just mad about getting caught. The Batman feels like a solid foundation for a stylish and entertaining series.",

Yes he is a little broody and gothic in this movie, but I like this version because it shows how messed up he still is from the death of his parents.  The setting is very dark, but Gotham is described as a breeding ground for crime and the movie did express this.  Some people had frustration because they wanted to see another story about how Batman wins despite all the challenges, but we forget that at the end of the day Batman is still just a man and cannot protect everyone despite how hard he tries.  This film showed the side of this well known hero that is gritty, depressed and very fractured.  It is realistic.  Only a god would be able to rid all evil from a city like Gotham, but this shows a younger Bruce that gives himself over to his own darkness in the form of \"Vengeance\" to protect the only thing he cares about; the city his parents died trying to make a better place.  This movie shows Batman's mistakes, and I like it.  This is the beginning of, I hope, a great series.",

I can't say I didn't like the overall plot and the final evolution for Batman, but for me it's been like reading the summary of Batman's world after having known for quite some time the world itself, so its been a nice visual experience but it didn't give me anything on the emotional side",

Pattinson is good as Bruce Wayne but really shines as Batman, and the script focuses on the intimidatingly silent detective more than the super-human super-rich super-hero. The Riddler's riddles aren't sublime, but they're more than good enough to carry keep the audience intrigued until the answers are revealed. This film's primary sin is its length, clocking in at four minutes shy of three hours, when a deft editor could have trimmed it down by a solid half hour if he had been allowed to do so.\n\nClosest comparison: It's like Batman Begins by way of Joker (2019).\n\nSetting: Crime\nPlot: Detective\nTone: Thriller",

Despite the cast not being quite as good as the Nolan batman films, I think they were still great, especially the Riddler and the Penguin who are two characters I believed need to be looked at more seriously.

I feel terrible for the loss of three hours of my life, and can't imagine how disappointed Robert Pattinson is for trusting his work to hacks with no vision. I don't care what anyone else says, this was not successful film noir nor a decent homage to Mickey Spillane. I suspect this director /writer wannabe thought Batman needed to be more real.

It's so interesting to give a POV of how criminals think he could be there and how paranoid it can make a person. The film is long but I don't think it felt too drawn out. It really felt like a 2-hour movie. The acting is really great, the action is spectacular, and the soundtrack is something to behold. Paul Dano does a really great job with Riddler and he does really well portraying the twisted and mental unwellness of the character.

It felt like a bad Hommage and that just continued throughout the entire film, which I thought was quiet sad, that they didn't even try to make it their own. The only really great thing about The Batman was Colin Farrell as the Penguin. His take on Oswald as far as the had let him go with it was just great. He's the superior actor and though his screen time is very limited, he sticks out, unlike the leading roles. Pattinson is great at everything else he did, really, this was just very unfit. And I promise I won't rant about the absolut failure of casting for Ed nor the Joker, but to be honest, the fucked up the characters by choosing horribly wrong actors. There are amazing examples of those characters out there, like in the show Gotham... But really, save your time and go see some other great movie, because this is just an attempt to make big money off of the most favorite DC hero there is and try to latch on to success marvel has with their stuff.",

Batman is all non-verbal. Robert nailed it. Just like in Twilight. He made that character come alive in all his darkness. It was phenomenal to watch. Robert really had big shoes to fill like twilight, and he rose to the occasion. Except this time just blew it out the water. Got more in shape, looks older, and just has that gorgeous brooding look with that chiseled jaw line! I'm so proud of him as a fan of his work and in general. I think on some level he is as reclusive as Bruce Wayne, or he seems to be. But nothing better then to see Robert smile. Melts me every damn time. \n\nBut joker will never be better then Heath Ledger. He will be the best there ever is or was. I would loved to have seen them together. Two method actors playing one of the best roles in movie history. But since that shall never happen, we miss you Heath, I settle for what we get. Though I think keeping Jared Leto should have been a key to this. I think he's the second best method actor for joker there is.\n\nOverall great movie. Action packed. Zoe is ok, not my fave, the title of cat women to me will always be Michelle Pfifer.\n\nI enjoyed it. Loved seeing my guy be a hero, from Edward to Batman he's truly a girls dream guy. I know the world is gonna shit on him like they did twilight. Kristen was the shit actor for that role, not Robert. So I hope this renews peoples faith. He's put a lot of work into proving himself. I think this nails that coffin \n\nSide bar, friggin Colin Farrell? I had no idea?!? Brilliant. Another great method actor. \n\nGreat job Robert! Great job Matt Reeves!",

Pattinson may have been lacking as Bruce Wayne, but he actually did well as Batman. Of course, I don't think it hurt that he bears passing resemblance to Affleck once he's in the cowl. I liked the more gritty and true to life tone of the film. I also felt the casting was believable and didn't leave me longer for any actors who've moved on from the franchise. My one reservation came with the Riddler's choice of disguise. I think an asexual narcissist who prides himself on his intellect would be more likely to use his brain and technology to conceal his appearance over a mask one might expect to find in a store with tinted windows and a neon sign. I also would expect him to leave a backdoor in that technology for Batman to decode if he could prove himself to be up to the task.",

Terrible, that was just lazy writing, why would he tell Falcone he was going to snitch on him? Besides that, there aren't any big problems with the plot or anything. The Riddler was a Perfect villain, very interesting origin, and believable motivation. He has a child trauma, attention, mental, and psicological problems, what he wants is to be remembered, and he covers his real motivation by acting like he is making Gotham some justice.\nAnd lastly the vengeance to hope transition is fantastic, I love the moment at the Gotham square garden with that Riddler henchman when bruce realizes that being vengeance doesn't inspire anything good.",

Gotham is dark, haunting, and the negative transfer to film really helped elevate the gritty aesthetic.  The biggest hurdle the film faced is its length. Clocking in at a whopping two hours and fifty-six minutes, the film begins to meander around a lackluster cat and mouse game infused with sub-plots that could have and should have been either condensed or cut out entirely.  It's shocking to think that there are sequences of the Joker that were cut out of the film, which makes one wonder, how much longer did Reeves intend on the final cut. The fight sequences doesn't push this genre forward in any unique or revolutionary ways and Pattinson and Kravitz's on screen chemistry was non-existent.  The Penguin, played by Colin Farrell, was absolutely jaw-dropping in terms of the actor's transformation.  I didn't realize it was Farrell until the credits.  The Batman can be appreciated by hardcore Batman fans, but for the average viewer, this latest rendition of the Caped Crusader might be a single viewing experience.",

It goes for a slow pace in a good way so you know whats going on. This movie has all the stuff your probably looking for in a Batman movie.

Unfortunately, they Mary Sue'd him to bulletproof with a talent for answering riddles, but not because he is intelligent or a good detective as Batman has always been. This Batman has no clue, is dull, and thinks a rat with wings is a stool pigeon which has him looking for an informant that doesn't exist until someone explains it to him. I was fooled into watching this because of the reviews. I'll always give films a chance. After seeing it I confronted those who said they liked it and was told \"what did you expect?\" I expected you to not lie. Apparently it has become a trend to not say any movie is bad because it can hurt people's feelings. My feelings are hurt that all of you liars tricked me into watching this. I won't do that.

However, I found that the costumes weren't very well designed. The riddler has more vibrant colors in the comics or even \"Gotham\". I found his design unfinished. Furthermore, I found the casting pretty poor, I did not appreciate Robert Pattison in the role of the Batman. Furthermore, Alfred does not look very old. He is supposed to be at least 50 to 60 years old. He looks like he is about 40. The romance developed between Batman and Catwoman is not at all well constructed. In the movie, I feel like they rushed it. Their first kiss made no sense. Bruce Wayne is portrayed as an emo-depressive guy unable to defend himself and a victim of everyone. Finally, Batman is supposed to be a vigilante at the beginning. How is it everyone accepts him being on crime sites when he wants. I understand he is in the end considered a hero by all but people are still supposed to despise him. Gordon is neither chief of police nor commissioner so why doesn't any policeman stand up (like the guy in the beginning) and try to arrest him. I also find that the role of Bruce Wayne in the movie is too little. He is described as the \"son of Gotham\", yet he only appears at one event in a 3-hour long movie for ten minutes. I found the development of every character very rushed and not at all well constructed. I may seem harsh, however, a huge movie franchise such as batman needs to be very well written and directed. Each character in batman has a story, yet in the movie, none of them were explained. In addition, the movie doesn't follow any series or previous movies so we don't know any backstory as it should have been done.",

I preferred the Affleck version of The Batman (and this despite Affleck not usually being a draw for me to a movie) because it was more like the comic books: fantastical, brooding and alpha yet not overdrawn and conspicuous as I found this portrayal written to be (again, ala Nolan).",

They made the riddler look like some psycho bandage guy, when the riddler is supposed to be a genius maybe a psychopath but a genius. And I hate to say but never have I ever seen the riddler wearing full on bandage garb that alone is a big thumbs down not to mention the personality. I just thought nothing they did In this movie fits what all of us know and expect when it comes to batman. And don't even get me started on the atrocitie that was the penguin a 6ft tall normal 100% penguin what is going on in this movie penguin is extremely short not to mention deformed as well has 3 fingers and a thumb on each hand. And clearly that's not even close to what they portray in this movie they went completely off the reservation in this movie and in my opinion get a giant F for it.

            "content": "The tricky thing about reviving a long-lived franchise is, it's always going to be compared to its predecessors. And, as the caped crusader goes, that history is awfully long and speckled. Tim Burton dealt with this when he helmed the 1989 iteration, dodging complaints that it was so fundamentally different from the Adam West camp of twenty years prior. Christopher Nolan fought an uphill battle in overcoming the damage inflicted by Joel Schumacher's missteps. Now, in the wake of Ben Affleck's turn beneath the cowl, Matt Reeves faces a different, but similar fight in justifying his vision of a spandex-clad detective in the crumbling urban decay.\n\nReeves gives us a younger Batman, less seasoned and polished than the Kilmer/Clooney/Affleck years, but also not a rookie. This isn't an origin story; this bat's reputation has already been established in Gotham and he's fostered a tenuous working relationship with certain members of the police force. He's visible enough to draw the attention of a violent, counter-culture master criminal who addresses hints and clues like love letters and sprinkles them around his prolific crime scenes. But he lacks that grand, accomplished sense of supreme confidence: a patrolman who's still learning his beat, he makes mistakes and takes lessons from them. Actually, he makes a *lot* of mistakes. This Batman is neither impervious in a fight nor unmatched in an intellectual sense. He often seems like he's out of his depth, reacting and improvising to events beyond his control. That can be humanizing, but it also limits his aura. In terms of raw energy and dramatic appearances, this rendition ranks near the bottom. I might even call him dull.\n\nThat's a problem with the whole film, in fact. It has inspired and effective moments, isn't demonstrably bad, but constantly feels clinical and lethargic. There's very little dramatic spectacle, so I was never wowed. For all the boastful talk about emphasizing the detective aspect of his character, Batman himself doesn't actually solve much. Alfred cracks most of the riddles, and when he's eventually indisposed, the Riddler complains that his counterpart isn't getting to the answers fast enough. Robert Pattinson's take on the leading role is... okay. He looks the part while in costume, but often overacts, and his take on the brooding Bruce Wayne, as I'd feared, falls on the wrong side of the emo spectrum. Paul Dano's Se7en-influenced Riddler is a fresh reimagining, but the conclusion of his story (or lack thereof) leaves an empty feeling. Hints and implications are dropped all over the place - about Gordon, the Penguin, Catwoman and other noteworthy rogues who shall remain nameless - but none go beyond the level of superficial winks. Batman and Robin's Mister Freeze, for all his cheesy one-liners and bad costume effects, had a more cohesive, satisfying story than any of these characters.\n\nI don't want to give the wrong impression. This isn't a bad effort. I admire its influences, and its chutzpah for wearing them loudly on its chest. Gotham is dark and gritty, its corrupt politicians serving as an appropriate mirror to their real-life counterparts. The costumes and set designs look great. But, in a strange way, I feel that it tries too hard to match the execution of 2019's Joker without really grasping what made that movie tick or why the two should be distinctive. Both are deathly serious, heavily visual, mood-reliant character pieces, but where Joker limits its iris to a small, tight group of characters, The Batman is overwhelmed by its cast. Joaquin Phoenix takes us on a private journey in the former film, and it's meaningful when his arc is resolved. Pattinson, by comparison, never progresses beyond looking mopey in the rain.",

But the praises don't stop there, as Batman is actually written exactly how he should be. He gets a satisfying character arc of going from being about vengeance, to being a symbol of hope and inspiration, and he refuses to kill or use guns. The Riddler is also a great character, as he has very complex motives and goals, and Paul Dano delivers an incredible performance. But the best thing about the movie, is the fact that it retreads elements from so many previous superhero films (from both DC and Marvel) that it is actually impressive and unique.

And everyone who seems to know the name of Bruce Wayne and that of his intrepid counterpart, the Batman, seems to have their preferred permutations of their favorite masked vigilante. For some, it may be the comedic stylings of the late Mr. Adam West's self-aware approach to the hero that they let fill their head; for others, it is the more dramatic performance of Mr. Michael Keaton that sent the old drug of nostalgia through their veins, but for myself, it was the bruting, dark performance of Mr. Christian Bale that rested on the skyscraper-mounted gargoyles of my mind. Like most who hold on to the past, I was skeptical of the film, and like most who care to experience the present with an open mind, my views changed the day I sat down in a darkened IMAX and let the sweet sounds of \"Ave Maria\" fill my ears...\n\nTwo hours and fifty-six minutes later, and the world made sense. The birds sang, and the sun shone as I stumbled from the theater's embrace, a changed man; it was as if nature itself was crying out in one voice, \"The king is dead. Long live the King!\" rightfully forgetting every other film that predated this masterpiece... An exaggeration? Yes, but the film had indeed stirred something inside myself a bit more than your typical blockbuster. You see, the plot: a weaving mystery which felt both fulfilling and enjoyable along the way; the acting: natural; the set design, the makeup, props, and more: entrancing, but the piece that truly tied it all together was the cinematography.\n\nAs I have attested, the story is enjoyable, a well-put-together mystery neo-noir with a toe dipped in the superhero pool. Still, without Mr. Reeves' and, the director of photography, Mr. Greig Fraser's masterful cinematography, it would have been just that, enjoyable, not the piece worthy of intercontinental cinema fans' ogling. Books could be filled with tales of woe and praise for this film's unique and fascinating techniques behind the scenes, and, if you will allow me to make an appeal to hypocrisy, libraries could be filled with what I do not know about that elusive art, so I will keep my remarks brief and without too much jargon. The beauty of the cinematography lies with the breathtaking use of \"dirting\" the lens and making you feel the weight of the moment along with the characters; that, along with gorgeous tracking shots, beautiful lighting, and more, is what makes the film what it is loved for today. There.\n\n\"The Batman\" is a truly intriguing film, flaws and all. However, I wish not to delve into said flaws as it might spoil the film for those among us who have not yet seen it, I merely wish to say I don't love parts of the story by themselves (namely the last fight and the Batman's seemingly invincible nature), but in the end, each of the said parts works around for the benefit of the plot and the film as a whole. This film is one I believe has the potential to spark great creative change in a seemingly static Hollywood and one I would recommend even to those who are not a fan of the genre. And maybe I don't know what you're thinking, but if you are anything like me, it might have something to do with our old, elusive pal, the Batman, and his many escapades above the towering lights of Gotham and under the limelights of Hollywood.",

He stumbles when playing the other side.  The decision to make the billionaire a moody, sulking, slacker was not a good one.  Pattinson plays the part like he's trying to channel James Dean.

            "content": "\"But when that light hits the sky, it's not just a call. It's a warning... to them.\"\n\nBatman has the longest filmography than any other comic book superhero. Why? Because wrapped within the cape and beneath the cowl wrapping around a dark, expressionless demeanor are layered nuances leaning towards his definitive inner self and multiple meanings behind his role, being exclusively grounded and more realistic when compared next to far-fetched heroic gimmicks. The true reality of his comics was first adapted modernly by Tim Burton before spawning an animated series that furthered that very modernization of the caped crusader. Both mediums across both platforms nurtured the bat, with more successes than certain low failures still under constant maintenance, and whoever becomes the dark knight give it their all with proudful faithfulness and empathy towards the darkened soul's hidden depths.\n\nAnimation appealed in masterful style and skillful acting for correctly measured deliverance which seems to take up most of his media, while the live action films immerse you than just observing whilst entertained amidst the other medium. Burton's modernness showed his tuned direction being the most realistic of his quirky fantasies, then continued differently with wrongfully directed emphasis for something looking more friendly under expressionism as another way of describing the towering, humanely messy environment's broken core. Christopher Nolan raised up the ante more towards realism through his self-contained trilogy of masterpieces known collectively as The Dark Knight Trilogy that brought the hero to his cinematic peak. Not going to wholly talk about the DC Extended Universe whereas the next incarnation took place next to other heroes taking on bigger threats that ask for skills and intelligent beyond the sole realm, but Ben Affleck's portrayal proved praiseworthy over its accuracy, except when Joss Whedon dumbed him down akin to Joel Schumacher's ridiculed obligation.\n\nReboots nowadays are frantic attempts to re-visualize another story that a previous generation enjoyed, though there are cases that are criticized as too soon and indecently loose. The distance between Adam West and Michael Keaton is generational, then Christian Bale took over the character to be part of the genre's regeneration till his ended run allowed DCEU to embrace the screen, including a new Batman being too soon after Bale's. Next to Batman at that critical aspect is Spider-Man having introduced three different iterations within the span of 14 years, though eventually successful in being united. But unlike Marvel's formality outside Sony's informality, Batman's sole features remains distantly generational, excluding Affleck's Batman being a part of a shared universe rather having ever been treated his own solo heroic outing. So, from West to Keaton to Bale, Robert Pattinson takes up the mantle, reverting the hero's independency with his own narrative without any interconnected storylines affected by other heroes as Gotham's deep ends does provide multiple stories on their own while being more reflectively realistic. Ironically, Pattinson's iteration was originally Affleck's continuation before creative differences lowered the initially passionate interest and decided to start anew with masterfully experienced reboot director Matt Reeves. Each reboots darkens closer to our grounds, and this one, \"The Batman\", is no exception by how bleak it has actually become while more advanced artistically as a powerfully framed masterpiece.\n\nA sadistic serial killer known as the Riddler begins targeting key political figures in Gotham by their secretive connections, while mounting towards something bigger behind it all. The caped crusader vigilante known as Batman must venture the city's underworld in a race against time before the killer makes a move after leaving cryptic trail of clues. Batman must deal with formed alliances and bring justice to power abuse from hidden corruption that long plagued the metropolis, including questioning his family's involvement and what about the legacy he is carrying.\n\nThe key figures surrounding the film are Matt Reeves and Robert Pattinson. Pattinson's buildup to the role stemmed from his dramatic hits, particularly his resurgence between \"The Lighthouse\" and \"Tenet\" with earlier release \"Good Time\" as his producerly recognized peak but does not shake off his stardom booster from The Twilight Saga. The said franchise planted his fame in mainstream cinema, and the backlash of his casting announcement as the next Batman/Bruce Wayne deemed him premature for such a role to carry, which officialized a challenge for the actor to conquer. Priorly defining his possible iteration can be seen in \"Justice League Action\" when Batman cringes at his younger self's early outings with proclamations he has grown more serious to. Now upon seeing it, Pattinson exceeded expectations with a compelling, raw performance in a perfectly suited light as a man who wants to make a difference to his city by inspired genetic inheritance through nightly vigilantism, only to grow tired over constant spawns and greed still lingering away from the light. The rawness radiates from the fact that this iteration is only a couple years into the darkness, showcasing more realism over theatricality in the pushed embrace. He gives off a gloomy, recluse billionaire with intelligence and rightly placed heart before steady disbelief as his persona start looking for answers. When he puts on that cowl, he defined the dark knight so exceptionally to the point of successfully making the portrayal as his own equally like Keaton and Bale, and Affleck in \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\". He grown accustomed in conquering the challenge as his stoic evolution that balances between intimidatingly stance, coordinated action pieces with occasionally needed gritty grace and displaying more of the character's detective skills than just pure action like before mostly, as well showing the nocturnal animal's dominance by frequency. So far into the year, he really set the performative bar for memorably recognized, mesmerizingly acknowledged acting.\n\nAside from expectations surrounding Pattinson's role, everything else gets determined by Matt Reeves directing what the picture going to look like. He thrilled in mysterious \"Cloverfield\" but truly shined with humane touches in both \"Dawn of\u2026\" and \"War for the Planet of the Apes\", the latter being his previous direction shown on screen with quite an impressionable impact afterwards. He has proven to direct, as well write, skillfully with visionary treatment at epic proportions from delicate craftsmanship that complexes the subject matter under impeccable style, including unpredictable twist and turns to roughen the vision and further solidifying masterfully when executed non-generically. His take on Batman also grits towards realism while mostly replace theatricality as felt through the Nolanverse for practicality that seems to add more to the story with such sensible approach, like these directors are learning off of each other whenever lighting the bat signal. In addition, he seems to have taken it further by bringing in a complex retrospective as indirectly acknowledged, commonly thematic connection of Batman's filmography with fresh depth, therefore resulting his take to be one of the defining best overall while arguably the finest on the cinematic and intellectual scale. This enabled the focus on the character to demonstrate more of his detective skills than just an action figure on call as he navigates the cryptic trails and picturesque connections amidst a zodiac-like mystery, leading towards whatever sort of medicine that Gotham need to consume then thrive.\n\nSpeaking of which, the selected antagonist Reeves went with is the Riddler out of Batman's rogue gallery, and this iteration is more of an update to become an actual terrorizing threat rather than just something looking ridiculing. As part of the film's bleaker turn, this is a darker version with criminal capability staged to the fullest, seemingly reflecting off modern terrorism on contemporary advantageous platforms as another frightening layer without any sympathetic downfall rather just delusional, misdirected grudge maddeningly driven. Paul Dano enveloped himself within the crazed chaotic energy for the main antagonistic force the type of narrative asks for, performing provocatively and stunningly at the level between Heath Ledger's Joker in disturbing tactics and Tom Hardy's Bane in communication. These polar opposites amidst practically designed realism grounded closer furthers the compelling factor surrounding Reeves's masterful direction beyond this first part of a new trilogy as it will start being intriguing on how he will adapt other villains, characters, and other elements of the lore into his own shared universe whilst perfecting worldbuilding.\n\nHow both Pattinson and Dano fulfilled their newly revised characters while ordinarily taking cues from pre-established storylines in altered, compelling directions becomes leading impressions for the rest of the cast to follow and either succeed or even exceed expectations. Purring with seriousness as Selina Kyle/Catwoman is Zo\u00eb Kravitz, memorable by her roles without a definite spotlight except between \"Into the Spider-Verse\" and \"The Crimes of Grindelwald\", then she surprisingly been given a chance to reprise her animated role from the unseen \"LEGO Batman Movie\" into live-action adaptation. Michelle Pfeifer and Anne Hathaway tend to steal the show whenever they build the chemistry with their male co-star in their respective Batman films, and Kravitz follows Pattinson's observed pattern characteristically embracing update. In other words, she performed at her most memorable with a defining spotlight by being just as methodically good as Pattinson, with a convincing, faithfully comic accurate chemistry at realistic touch spiced pessimistically as part of her charm.\n\nOut of the cast, Andy Serkis, who Reeves collaborated with before, is the most surprising as Alfred Pennyworth. Both Michael Caine and Jeremy Irons defined the character so nicely to the point of imagining the character's nature in association with what those actors brought, with the latter being closer towards accuracy. Alfred provides a moral compass to Bruce as both his father figure and closest friend he can rely on reminding who he is whenever he gets in too deep within his self-proclaimed shadows. He has a layered past that can be sought through his own show, but he mainly serves with faithful, caring demeanor and appropriately humorous by counter wit. Serkis is mainly identified through mainstream cinema with his humanism felt through primitive motion capture performances, while his other films are below the radar. He performed with his aforementioned humane front raw, also similarly developed like the other characters through encouraged performatively fresh iterations to further compel the worldbuilding visionary of this new trilogy.\n\nWhile there may be no best on how the particular characters are portrayed in the bleaker vision, but there has been proven of utter captivation surrounding some. James Gordon, Batman's trusted ally within the non-trusting police department, is charismatically played by Jeffrey Wright with quite an impactfully morale impression providing supportive commentary weight. Colin Farrell's transformative performance as greedily neutral mobster Penguin is praiseworthy merit with enough material to be intrigued in his proposed follow up. John Turturro actually toughens up in justifying both his casting and why his character Carmine Falcone deserves a definitive reminder of the frightful deal surrounding the crime lord. Finally, though briefly finalized and formally deleted, is Barry Keoghan seemingly following Heath Ledger's lead as the Joker in a blurry obscured vision, saved for the finest hour that could come somewhere sometime someday.\n\nReeves' style and the performances are stylistically backed up and emphasized by both cinematographer Greig Fraser and score composer Michael Giacchino. Reeves advanced the storytelling and the atmosphere to another ante, with Fraser's cinematographed help by becoming one of the prominent elements behind what makes the cinematic masterpiece so awe-inspiring through mesmerizingly coordinated shots, meaningful aspect ratios, and hindsight perspectives, overall capturing much artistically challenging angles in a tautly opportune matter. He remained distinctive and seemingly, understandably lessened after his previous amazing feat in \"Dune\". The final synergic ingredient is the equally tense score by Giacchino leveling down on what would really express the newfound atmosphere of a familiar setting while amping up the spectacle thrills to surprisingly loud volume that actually acts as aura immersion.\n\nPerfectly energized performances of iterated fulfillments treading across the fully geared direction of polishing a work of art in reaction towards a bleak, compelling retrospective, but such praise could signify a high rating if it were not for the act of overdoing things despite reasonable developments. The circumstances become disturbing under a mixture between Nolan and David Fincher, building up a disastrous, overdid climax beneath the fight witnessing hopelessly overhead and struck a familiar scenery felt in \"Titanic\". The event does serve a purpose to enable striking spectacle and story wise, but contrast in generic obligation apart from the tautly intimate flow into a separate concern when losing its practically grounded touch.\n\nIts running time could dissuade others while other epic pictures with similar length, such as \"Endgame\", maintained attention by being character-driven and climatically eventful buildups. \"The Batman\" would be on the other hand as this generation's epic picture akin to the Golden Age's long classics by also being an enthralling cinematic masterpiece that maintained fascination and therefore unbothered by its length when distracted by the story's strikingly presented outlets. It is one of the defining best for the superhero right next to the Dark Knight Trilogy, and honestly a breath of fresh air for the genre with no interconnected pressure that may or may not have been the DCEU's gambled downfall.

Matt Reeves deeply understands every nuance of the Batman character along with supporting characters such as Selina Kyle, The Riddler, Penguin, Jim Gordon, Carmine Falcone, etc. Robert Pattinson does a phenomenal job as a tormented Batman/Bruce Wayne who shares fantastic chemistry with Selina Kyle/Catwoman played by Zoe Kravitz. The dynamic between Pattinson's Batman and Jeffrey Wright's Jim Gordon brings some much needed levity to the film's ultra dark and gritty tone. Paul Dano delivers an outstanding performance as a radically different version of the Riddler, as does Colin Farrell who is completely unrecognizable as the Penguin. Unlike past live action Batman films, the Batman's narrative relies heavily on the detective aspect of the character which has yet to be explored in full detail. As a result we get an extremely engaging slow burn detective/noir film as opposed to the fast paced action-packed film that we're typically used to with modern comic book movies. That being said, this film is not for everyone. It's also notable that this is by far the most comic-accurate live action iteration of Gotham City to date. The griminess and the history of crime in the city is beautifully displayed in the opening scene and really sets the tone for the rest of the film, which is only further enhanced by Greg Fraser's stunning cinematography and Michael Giacchino's epically haunting score. Overall, The Batman is a PERFECT Batman film that delivers in every single aspect imaginable, and deserves to be placed among one of the greatest comic book movies ever made. (10/10)",

Then I started hearing people say it was the best movie ever. Really?! Now don't get me wrong, I'd love for every movie I see to be the best ever, but that, in my opinion, is very much an exaggeration. Now, if you're a comic book fan and you're a huge Batman fan, maybe. To you. But to everyone else, maybe this film was a just a really good DC film. Finally. I'll give you that. It WAS good. I liked it. It was cool. I appreciated the characters. I really like what they did with Bruce Wayne/Batman. The detective aspect of his character was classic and it played well. The villain(s) were great. Now, I just wished I hadn't heard some people hype it up as much as they did. This was not an epic film to go nuts about. It just wasn't THAT good. It was somewhat unique and different in that it stood alone from the other Batman films. It definitely satisfied in that regard. The ONLY real knock I had was it seemed to be stuck a bit in its pace. I couldn't put my finger on it, but it made the already long film seem a little bit longer than it should. The more I think on it, I realize I didn't like that almost the entire film was dark. Intentionally so and I know that, but ultimately, I think that was a mistake. There were no literal or figurative \"windows of light\" to allow the viewer to come up for air. I kinda felt beat down by the end. Maybe I'm being overly critical, but it bothered me that I didn't like it more than I did. The bottom line for me is that this was a solid new version of Batman for DC without the complete entertainment value I'm used to in a hero story. Christopher Nolan's version is still my favorite Batman. Overall 8/10 and \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb - go see it on the big screen! In DOLBY if you can! Enjoy!",

We luckily get to dodge another Thomas and Martha death scene and see a different kind of coming up movie. Batman is in his early stages and still learning about what kind of symbol he is for Gotham. \n\nThis is shot in such a fun and thoughtful way. The use of anamorphic lenses really help you focus on the important puzzle bits or mystery solving bits. You as a viewer are built into this narrative as a silent sidekick. The different shots make you feel like you are there or riding along side Batman as the mystery unfolds. \n\nWhere there is a brutality to this film it isn't the point or flair of this movie. This movie is first and foremost a dramatic mystery that harkens to the mystery noirs of old. Batman takes his licks though and displays frustration when he even has to start or enter a confrontation. His roadblock are just that, he isn't looking for a fight. He just wants truth and answers and remove roadblocks along the way. \n\nGotham, the villains and villainous elements feel very grounded in reality. You definitely feel like you've seen or heard of these types of things in reality. It definitely helps bring Batman to life more. However, it does kind of make me wonder how the more fantastic villains can be handled in the future. \n\nDespite my ravings, it feels a bit too long. However, I honestly can't find a place that isn't important enough to cut without leaving a disappointing gap. All the information is important to rapping up the mystery or character building for Bruce Wayne.",

A lot of dark, not a lot of knight.\n\nThe other members of the cast all do a good job too but aside from Kravitz as Selina Kyle, nobody really has any drive or motivation beyond what they need to act in the script. There's some memorable moments but nothing I'll remember as a stand-out scene. The riddler is completely forgettable and reminds me more of a cringe reddit troll than a batman villain.\n\nOverall it's an okay movie but I can't recommend it to anyone but DC fans or Batman fans. Not until it perhaps has a sequel that shows us the growth of Bruce Wayne as Batman in contrast to his many flukes and flops in this movie. That way it can retroactively become a story of becoming the batman, instead of a story about being a guy who needs therapy, dressing up like a bat.",

It sets well with the eerie score and just a dark tone.\nThe cinematography is probably the part which is least talked about. The part batman walked up to the penguin after the car chase scene meneacingly with the loud score playing as he walks towards him, top tier cinematography. Badass.\nRiddler is fantastic. He is the villain that looks most like what the city looks and what a comic would portray as. The movie did well to portray him as a goofy cartoonish villain to a menacing scary villain to the audience. You also understand his motivations and why he is doing what he does in the movie.\nNow to one of my favourite parts, the setting aka Gotham. Sweet mama is Gotham fantastic in this movie. It really portrays that it is a sespool and a horrible place to live, and that's great. It matches with the tone the movie gives us.\nOverall my favourite superhero movie, my favourite batman movie and a 9.5/10 in my opinion",

It manages to tie together two separate storylines quite well up to the 2 hour mark, at which point an entirely different movie is suddenly slapped on at no additional charge. The climax of the film is a narrative train wreck that feels rushed in spite of the film's overly long runtime. The overall motif of Batman inspiring other people to take the law in their own hands is an interesting take, and Bruce's words at the end leave me interested in what direction they'll take this iteration of the Bat.",

            "content": "\"The Batman\" has finally taken us back to the roots of the Caped Crusader, in the way that its dark narrative and frighteningly realistic setting matches Bob Kane's original vision in a way that comics after his time never could.\nThis film also draws inspiration from the best modern eras of Batman, including the late 70s through the 90s, when creating its overall dark mood. \nRobert Pattinson's fantastic performances as both Bruce Wayne and The Batman are stunning, although he doesn't get much time to shine as Wayne. Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Paul Dano and Collin Farrell are fantastic performers, and we get to see their acting in different (and frankly, better) ways than we've ever seen them before. The treatments of both Jim Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) and Alfred Pennyworth (MoCap King Andy Serkis) are very good, but neither characters are given much time to represent their comic counterparts; something that Matt Reeves is sure to remedy for the imminent sequel. Rounding out the cast is the magnificent and legendary John Turturro, with a terrifying and entertaining turn as a classic Batman mob boss. While the more \"regular\" Batman villains like mobsters and mob bosses have never been properly represented on the Big Screen (apologies to the fans of Christopher Nolan's \"Batman Begins\" and Tim Burton's \"Batman\"), Turturro's performance as Carmine Falcone (and Dano's as Edward \"The Riddler\" Nashton, for that matter), reminds us that evil people don't have to be super-villains to be deadly and menacing.\nIn conclusion, the Batman is fantastic. From Pattinson's opening monologue, to the constant musical theme of Franz Shubert's \"Ave Maria,\" and to the Biblical imagery that runs throughout the film, Matt Reeves' intended theme is clear: To right the sins of the fathers, we must be willing to sacrifice something of ourselves.\n\nBenjamin Hennler\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nP.S. I especially appreciated the lack of unnecessary CGI throughout the film. Most modern action films (Marvel is especially guilty of this) rely too heavily on effects that are obviously animated. In \"The Batman,\" the scene where The Batman crashes to the ground after flying gracefully in his wingsuit, stood out to me. I could tell in the moment I first saw it, that that was done practically.",

The Start and End monologues are written very well and the scene with the batman walking towards the penguin in the rain deserves its own award just due to how impactful it was.

With The Batman, long gone are the days of flash colours, bat nipples & cheesy one liners. This is a serious film, impactful, memorable and impossible to take your eyes off. It's a very stripped back, down to earth movie, not rely on fancy special effects or over-elaborate set pieces. The characters don't spend their time trying to sound smart or out quip each other, they talk like regular people. The action, while not like anything you'll to see on a day-to-day basis, is very grounded and believable. The premise of a man dressing up in a costume to fight crime is treated with just the right amount of sincerity and gravitas. Robert Pattinson, an incredibly talented actor who's successful broken free from the sparkly vampire role many thought would define his career forever, spends more than 80% of his screen time not as Bruce Wayne, but as the caped crusader. He's not a billionaire playboy or hapless company owner, he's a dedicated crime fighter who only seems comfortable when he's donned the cowl and black makeup. As many have remarked, the film is more of a detective story than it is a superhero movie, and that's great. Rather than trying to outdo what previous instalments have done, Reeves has taken a character we're all familiar with and presented him in a different way. He's essentially a sleuth, a cop with more gadgetry and much less red tape, chasing down a criminal who is terrorising the city while also dealing with unsavoury characters from a seedy underworld. Paul Dano's Riddler is, sadly, too close to Ledger's Joker to not invite comparisons, and while his performance is great, there's nothing about his motivation or behaviour that's especially unique. The 3-hour runtime was daunting, but most of it passed by in a flash because I was so invested in what was going on. Sadly, the film loses steam in the 3rd act. There's still some interesting things going on, but it feels like the film built to an organic climax, then struggled to find anywhere to go afterwards. But there's a reason people are calling this the next great Batman film. Its intense, its epic in scale, has a beautiful aesthetic, likeable characters and a killer lead performance. A sequel is apparently in the works, and if its anywhere near as good as this, I'll be first in line to see it.",

While a number of films that gain publicity are entertaining and fun, many of them feel generally uninspired or forgettable (particularly in anything that isn't the writing or acting). The Batman stays consistent in it's themes and actually utilizes the environment to propel its story in a revivifying way. The city of Gotham actually feels like a place with a history to care about. The combination of the layers of sound and the distinctive lenses used add immensely to the mood and ambiance. The use of lighting accentuates the atmosphere and provides in tone what I usually only notice from the music composition. All of this is able to be interpreted by audiences peripherally without forcing everyone to sit through a boring exposition instead. Truly, there's so much care and thought put into the writing, sound design, cinematography, music composition, lighting and costume/set design that it's palpable. There's so much I could write an essay on it. \n\nOverall, I wish more film studios would step it up and allow the creative teams to work with more originality to achieve their own unique visions. The Batman might seem long, but it ties up a lot of its loose ends nicely and leaves the audience feeling generally satisfied.

            "content": "This Batman takes more than a little inspiration from Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.\nIt feels like a spiritual sequel to Batman Begins, starring a sophomore Batman who is still getting used to his vigilantism. The presence of chiaroscuro lighting, a gravelly-voiced hero, and a villain shooting threatening home videos all feel very familiar, though still entertaining.\n\nPattinson's Bruce Wayne has an oddly emo sensibility, with long hair that falls into his eyes as he says things like \"You're not my father, Alfred!\" His Batman, however, is an intimidating figure with a mind to match the muscles. Zoe Kravitz's Catwoman is the most three-dimensional take on the character yet. Paul Dano's Riddler is really an original character, bearing more resemblance to the Zodiac killer than the comic book villain. The standout of the cast is Colin Farrell as Penguin, who strikes the perfect balance between camp and menace.\n\nThe plot is convoluted, relying heavily on unseen backstory and spinning a mystery that never really pays off. Its biggest weakness, though, is how utterly humorless it is. Gotham is home to the most brooding, sullen people on earth. Its greatest strength is the way it returns to Batman's roots as the world's greatest detective, letting him spend as much time solving puzzles as he does beating up criminals.\nOverall, it's a well-made movie but while it doesn't feel stale, it doesn't feel fresh, either.",

            "content": "The attention to detail in the scenes that tour Gotham remind me of the shades of green effect used in the film \"The Matrix.\" With a 3 hour run time, the viewer can experience the bold and well constructed vision of the city. Scenes with combat remind the us that Batman, is in fact, a man. Despite the advantages Bruce Wayne can afford to arm himself with, the struggle for Batman to fight as a one-man army feels calibrated and suspenseful. Colin Farrell's performance as Penguin is probably the most notable in the movie. The much praised makeup is indeed impressive, but more so is the depth of the character. Penguin is both Batman's adversary, and needed resource into the criminal underworld. However, what the film lacks is narrative and vision. Robert Pattinson's performance as Bruce Wayne is competent, but the story is a hot mess. The movie starts as a sort of nod to David Fincher films regarding serial killers, the most obvious being (borderline copying) \"Zodiac.\" A large portion of the movie is dedicated to Batman's work with Selina Kyle \"Catwoman.\" This is perhaps the worst component of the movie. Zo\u00eb Kravitz's performance just seems silly. Though the character is written into almost every aspect of the story, none of the revelations that occur as the story unfolds seem worth caring about. Her delivery just isn't unconvincing. This is partly the writing as well. There's the notion of Batman calling himself \"vengeance\" throughout the film. It wouldn't exactly be a spoiler to say that this is a device in the story to show the character's development. But again, this never really materializes in a convincing or interesting way. The Batman doesn't leave me too excited for its sequel, but this is by no means a bad movie. I don't think I could say a movie that held my attention for such a long runtime is not worth watching. At one point I checked to see how much time was left, and I became excited with I saw I had an hour left to go.",

The rest of the cast did an outstanding bringing the story to life. I honestly feel that when Bob Kane was creating Batman he didn't really intend for him to be tech-savvy. It was great to see a Batman story more on the whodunnit and gritty fights side. The muscle car version of the Batman is now my favorite. Before it was Tim Burton's version in his respective movie. My only two issues with the movie is the length and the fight scenes. I felt the fight scenes could've been shot better. When I compare them to those in Fast Five I can't help to think they lack impact. The audience doesn't feel the punches and kicks like those in Fast Five.  I'm giving this movie four stars for the nearly three hour length and the fight scenes.",

It struggles, however, in falling victim to superhero tropes and lack of depth in its main characters, amongst an excessive run-time. Despite a progressive storyline, it seems unsure at times, and gives way to predictable 'superhero' cliches at times (IE the love interest). We also rarely get a feel of who Bruce Wayne really is, and don't get deep enough into the minds of Penguin, or even The Riddler. With the Zodiac inspiration, one might expect us to get a more intimate psychological view of the twisted menace terrorizing Gotham, yet we do not. And the Penguin is not much of a character at all. Perhaps in the sequel we will get to uncover more character depth, and see more of The Batman obliterating Gotham's seedy underbelly.",

            "content": "( Warning this Review Contains SPOILERS)\nRobert Pattinson as the new iteration of Batman is a unique difference choice but after watching this movie he also is the most monotone batman. Also him being Bruce Wayne is also the same monotone. It's like he doesn't have a character change between the two like every other batman. When he's Bruce Wayne he doesn't act like an eccentric billionaire like in either the comics or other movies. He simply acts like a emo all depressed 20 year old. What's funny is in this movie he literally acts the same in all the twilight movies. None of my friends are willing to admit it because they hate twilight but love this movie. So take that for what you will. Makes no sense. Anyway Robert Pattinson is very forgettable and to me the biggest reason why I'm giving this movie a thumbs down. But it does have a lot of positives. Riddler played by Paul dano is great. I hate his character choices towards the very end for being dumb by turning himself in thinking the batman was on his side. What a dumb guy. But before the ending him being this over the top crazy person putting bombs on peoples necks and blowing up the sea wall that Miami and other big cities around the globe will have by 2050 due to duh duh climate change . So that was a nice touch with the sea walls. I also liked the riddlers gimp mask. Yes it looked like banes mask but cheaper from the dark knight rises but it's a different side of the riddler character that we've never seen before. I would've preferred if he said his iconic line ,\" riddle me this batman\" but maybe only in the comics and the video games. Cat woman was also in this movie and before watching this movie I thought I would dislike her but Zoe kravitz actually did a great job. I underestimated her I admit but she proved me wrong. She is hands down the best cat woman, sorry not sorry Halle berry and Anne Hathaway. I liked that she was introduced trying to work undercover for her dad. That was a nice touch. Also the special effects in this movie look great. The budget is there and you can tell. Looks great and I even surprisingly like how dark it looks but not a grey dark like Zack snyders garbage DC movies . This movie has a dark red green look to it if that makes any sense. What I'm trying to say in simple terms is it looks nice, I like the camera they use. Penguin is also in this movie and he was great as well. Colin Farrell looks in total disguise under all that prosthetics and fat suit but he is great. I can't wait to see for of him as the penguin. The falcone dude was in this and to me he was the worst of the villains by being so boring. Both Penguin and riddler were great because of how insane they both are. Falcone played by the guy who likes bowling  in the big Lebowski is also so monotone and I get why he was in the movie connecting cat woman and riddler to the batman but he didn't need that big of a presence in the movie. It would've made for sense of the riddler had a bigger role not falcone. And my final complaint with this movie is the runtime. It's so long . It's literally almost 3 hours. 2 hours and 56 minutes to be exact but it's basically 3 hours with commercials aka trailers. They could've trimmed it up a bit. But every movie needs to be 3 hours now for some reason. The pacing is horrible. Super slow but when it gets going it gets good. In the end this is a slow movie with a bad choice for Batman. I really think Robert Pattinson should've played night wing or Robin but not Batman. Either he was a boring monotone Batman or the script wrote for that. But he himself is a boring actors no offense because of twilight. In a bunch of reviews tons of people are saying that everybody forgot about twilight but let's be Honest. No one forgot. Anyway I think this movie would've been good if it had a different choice for Batman. Robert Pattinson is so emo and depressed looking that he doesn't feel like Batman but rather a Batman impersonator. At least we will always have Christian bales great movies. But if you did like this movie over the Christian bale movies I would like to have a discussion about that because I would have no idea what you could say.",

It's an element I feel hits to the core of the character that is often overlooked for more angst and brooding (which never fear, was absolutely alive and well here).

With clear Fincher vibes, it's a neo-noir thriller/murder-mystery that makes sure not to forget we're dealing with intelligent characters on both sides, it just happens to be that one them dresses up as a bat; that is to say, in many ways, it feels more realistic and grounded than any of the live-action films to come before it, complete with a fantastic cast who give their characters as much gravitas as you can hope for in a comic-book film. Serkis, Turturro, Wright, and a fantastically unrecognisable Farrell all do justice to their respective characters; Dano gives us a superior and creepy version of The Riddler who you can actually take seriously (the abscence of green spandex probably helped); Kravitz is easily the best Catwoman since Pfeiffer; and then, of course, there's Pattinson who brings anger and determination, but also inexperience and doubt to his young Batman giving us, perhaps, the most emotionally fragile version of the character so far. I mean that in the most positive way possible -- he's portraying a guy who is severely traumatised by the death of his parents and decides the best way to master his fear and channel his anger is to dress up as a bat and beat up criminals. He's not the most stable of individuals and there's a volatile mix of emotions there; this is what a novice Batman might be like. We also have to talk about the overall atmosphere informed by gorgeous visuals and production design (I absolutely love the look of the film, as well as the designs of the suit and car) that make the action scenes in particular pop. Gripping for its entire 3 hour run time, this is a very impressive first outing for Matt Reeves' \u2018The Batman': it feels fresh and exciting, a murder-mystery that focuses on the crime-solving aspect and is punctuated by violent bursts of visually stunning action. I'm looking forward to seeing what he can do with the sequel.",

I thought the idea of showing the detective skills of the Batman was good, but felt the movie as a whole was disjointed and sometimes jumped around with no rhyme or reason.  An example:  Alfred admonishes Bruce for not being present at all in running his business.  He says he must meet with the board of directors or was it investors(?) (My memory is a bit fuzzy on who he was meeting with). But then they just left that subplot hanging, nothing happened either way in the storyline, they just jumped to the next part in the story.\n\nAlso was a big yawn.  Did not keep my attention.  I half wonder if the professional critics that gave it good reviews actually sat down and watched the whole thing or just watched excerpts, because I cannot fathom why any of them would even give it a 4 star much less a 5 star, unless of course they were getting kick backs\u2026.\n\nI was not excited about Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/the Batman, but kept an open mind.  My gut feeling was correct, just did not buy him in that role.  Was not a fan of the greasy looking Bruce Wayne - take a shower please!  He came across sullen, self obsessed, rude to Alfred, and uncaring about the business that is going to fund all his bat toys.  I thought.. what an arrogant, immature brat \u2026 not a brooding super hero.\n\nJeffrey Wright is a fine actor, but just not right in the role of James Gordon.  Colin Firth on the other hand, was fantastic as the Penguin.  I did not think he would pull it off, but he did with flying colors.\n\nAnd what was up with the military style pants the Batman was wearing?  All I could think of was the villains were stupid not to shoot him in the legs - no protection there.\n\nAlso could not get behind the Bat Cave being in Gotham under Wayne Enterprises.  Isn't it suppose to be under Wayne Manor?  Seems to me like they used that same premise in Batgirl, the tv show. Since this Bruce Wayne never went to work, I'm not sure why they decided putting it under Wayne Enterprises was a good idea.  \n\nI'm all for origin stories, but this one missed the mark.  You have to knock it out of the park to beat Christian Bale's Dark Knight trilogy - unfortunately, The Batman just bunted the ball.",

            "content": "I think that this movie brought a lot of good ideas to the table but ultimately fell short in a lot of ways. Oh also, spoilers ahead. \n\n For a lot of the movie, it felt as thought they were building up to Bruce Wayne realizing the role he played in neglecting Gotham(not paying attention to where the renewal money is going, failing as a philanthropist) . But a lot of this is rather unexplored, as more emphasis is placed on the vigilante personality of Batman and how his mentality of vengeance has hurt Gotham more than helped it. I do think that this development of Batman is done well, but I really think the ending would have been much better if the film addressed how both Batman and Bruce Wayne failed Gotham, but now have a chance to be a symbol of hope for the city . With all this emphasis on how privileged Bruce Wayne is, it seems like a missed opportunity to not have the character realize how he can use his privilege to help those in need. Also, overall it just seems like Bruce Wayne is lacking from this film and I wish they had included more of Batman's development as Bruce in general.\n\nI also think that one of the best traits of Batman is that, at his core, he is a kind person who cares about human life, which exists in contrast to his more stoic and violent persona. I would say the best example of this can be found in the Nolan films and in Batman:the Animated series. But a lot of that kindness seems to be missing from this film, and there are multiple times within the film where he just seems to disregard human life (the exploding trucks in the car chase scene, and even how he shatters the glass roof at the end leaving giant chunks to fall upon citizens.) It makes his no-kill rule, which is emphasized quite often in the film, seem hypocritical and just there for show.\n\nA bigger complaint of the movie overall is that even though each of the actors did fantastic, it felt like a lot of characters were underdeveloped and their skills are never really explained. Like why is Selena Kyle so good at being a cat burglar? It seems like an oversight not to have this in her backstory. Also, the romance between Selena and Batman just seems to come out of nowhere and I wish more time was spent on developing that. The riddler seems to have all this information at his fingertips, and seems to have a good understanding of hacking but how he gets this information and how he acquired this skill is never explained either. Also his motive seems to switch in the last half of the movie, where he seems keen on exposing the rotten parts of Gotham, but then decides to kill a bunch of innocent people and targets the one uncorrupt politician in Gotham. It just does not seem like a logical progression of his character, and I wish they would have spent more time expanding on how this change occurs if they wanted to go this route. Also Jim Gordon is so underutilized in this film and the reason for all of his actions are boiled down to him being a \"good cop\" . Like why would this man risk his entire career for Batman? How did they even meet and why are they so close when Batman only been around for two years? For a lot of these questions about these characters, just a few lines of dialogue could suffice to explain it, which I guess is the frustrating bit of it. Especially because the run time for this movie is three hours, so not making time to include these bits of exposition seems like a bit of an oversight. \n\nOverall, I think that this film brings up a lot of interesting themes and takes on Batman but I really wish that some of them were explored more in depth. I think this film could have really benefited from cutting some characters so others could be more developed then trying to tackle all of these ideas and characters at once.",

Convoluted, dull (including the lack of illumination... some of us can't see well in the dark, folks!), the subsidiary characters popping and out with little backstory or explanation and above all the man himself (oh, why does he have to speak in that sort of soft growl? Is it supposed to make us take him more seriously?). I found myself caring not at all for whatever shadowy traumas of the past made him head for the nearest bad fancy dress rental in the first place. Yes, maybe you need to be a serious fan of the character and his \"story\" to enjoy this film, I'll accept that... or maybe there's something I'm totally missing. But needless to say, I hung in as long as I could and I do believe I gave the Caped Crusader a fair chance to prove himself but he failed miserably and I simply zoned out.

My only criticism being that I'm not a big fan of Robert Pattinson's Bruce Wayne interpretation but I could definitely see it growing on me in future movies and I understand why they've gone in this direction but Robert totally made up for it with his Batman as this movie delves into his detective skills and intelligence which we havent seen before and I love the direction they went with looking into the Wayne family's corrupt past and hope this leads into the court of owls in the sequels. Paul Dano's Riddler and Collin Farrels Penguin were both amazing but especially Paul Dano as i feel he nails this realistic and horrific take on a character we've only really seen done comedically. Matt Reeves shows he truly understands Batman and Gotham as a whole and I can't wait to see what direction he takes it in the future",

This new Batman is imo not even really your typical superhero movie at all. It's honestly nothing like any of them. But that's not a bad thing. I'd give the portrayal of Batman a perfect 10/10 if I could. It's a movie I couldn't watch over and over because I feel it's a slow burner and to keep some fans needs to speed up the pace on the next one. But the plot depth and build up of this movie is just perfect. It's cinematic approach perfect, action scenes some of the coolest of any movie yet especially that car chase scene!!!! Costumes, acting, handling of characters it's all perfect. I will say two things I know this is Batman but they need to improve lighting for the theater experience. An omfg what is up with the sound at a theater sucking so bad with this movie? When we all went everyone of us said it sounds like their whispering. Saw it twice and both theaters were the same way. I actually know a lot of people who loved it but didn't go watch it again because the sound was so quiet or bad. They need to improve that aspect for theaters because as amazing as the movie was the theater experience wasn't",

I think it helped to not take the film too serious and allow it to feel like a new experience. Separating it from all the other Batman films I've watched.\nIf this reboot continues, I would definitely be interested to see how it plays out.\n\nOkay, so what I liked about it was the style of the direction and roles the characters played. I've seen all the other films and for the most part they are edge-of-the-seat, superhero flashy action and epic fight scenes that want to make you jump out of your seat and cheer when something amazing happens.\nBut it was very different. It did have it's cool fights, it didn't take long to notice there was not a whole lot of fighting; though, I was okay with that. \n\nSome part of me was waiting for the grand, larger-than-life comic book style battles. What I got though felt more like real people playing their roles and not trying to pull off moves while looking like a rock star for the camera every moment. There were less that flawless executions and vulnerable moments which I liked.\n\nI did also like the throwback to the more gothy feel and mood. It had moments where I got some Crow vibes and I kinda miss that.\n\nSo anyways, definitely recommend. Make sure you have a good chunk of your day ready to watch this cause it's a long one and get comfy with some snacks and enjoy.",

The new Batman looks more like a homeless man, and when he's not in the Batman costume looks pretty harmless.\n\nWhen Selina Kyle booted Carmine Falcone over the edge of a building, I thought that would've been a good place for the movie to end. But it continued.\n\nThe Riddler didn't resemble the Riddler at all. He wore a gas mask over his face and the overacting by Paul Dano was forgettable. There wasn't much that was intimidating or super-villainly about him. Walking around the streets of NYC, I see scarier people (and that's not a knock on New York City but rather on Paul Dano and the script).\n\nLook at the pizzazz of Jim Carrey as the Riddler and Jack Nicholson as the Joker and you'll catch my drift.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's definitely worth watching, it's just not worth paying for.",

So edgy.  Se7en was a great detective thriller, this was not. The directing was poor, editing was even worse, and the acting was meh at it's very best.  Seriously, John Turturro as a mob boss? Jeffrey Wright sounded like Chris Pratt's Star-Lord speaking deeper when Thor is on his ship.  Zoe Kravitz is there to just look good because it sure isn't her acting, and her fight scenes, when it's her and not a stunt double, are so bad.  Ridiculous and/or nonsense scene after ridiculous and/or nonsense scene, what is implied one minute is reversed the next all in the name of trying to be dark...PG dark.

All though there is not much action, the action that does take place is phenomenal (especially the chase scene), it does not feel unnecessary and out of place. All actors throughout the film did an amazing job, Robert Pattinson played his part very well and I'm glad he didn't go for that very raspy voice Christian Bale did with his Batman. Paul Dano also played his part very well making you feel uneasy whether he just just standing in the background or when he is speaking to the Batman.

There is simply nothing else that I need to be shown, largely because we have apparently stopped trying to make Batman movies entertaining and we have started running them through a pace that gets darker and darker and darker until the experience comes off as unsettling and a little sad.  Let's put it this way, this is the first comic book movie that brought back memories of Se7en.  We shouldn't be doing this.\n\nThe Batman will be a joy to those fans who want the bat to roll around in the muck, to fight for a Gotham that is in danger of being buried by it's own inhumanity and corruption.  They get that here in droves \u2013 nearly three hours of it to be exact \u2013 and I'll admit, the approach felt a little different.  In it's best moments, I got a sense of the movie that I wanted from The Dark Knight Rises, a movie in which the entire political structure of Gotham City was so in bed with the mafia that you are unable to tell the difference; and meanwhile a lone menace stands in the shadows who wants to punish the city for its legacy of sin.\n\nThe problem is that we've seen this all before.  Tim Burton did it,  Christopher Nolan did it.  By this point, it's just a difference in style.  Director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, War of the Planet of the Apes) puts together a production that is breathtaking, but puts it in service of a movie that is not only bleak and ugly but way too long.  The movie has nothing to say that couldn't be wrapped up in under two hours.\n\nRobert Pattenson's Batman is not exactly ground-breaking, though he does scale back a bit.  He's less talky, less emotional, more detached.  To effect, this gives the character a sense of presence and dread.  Unlike the Nolan Batman, this bat's philosophy for wanting to spend his evenings beating up criminals on the streets of Gotham kind of goes without saying.  He is also less dependent on gadgets.  They're here, but those wonderful toys take a backseat during the moments when he uses his fists to turn a thug's face into hamburger.\n\nThe setting and the story feels somewhere between old film noir and the aesthetics of Blade Runner.  Corner to corner, Gotham is a cesspool of crime and degradation while high above the 1% dance the night away in their penthouses (the movie is not subtle about this).  Keeping it that way is another matter.  The political arena of Gotham is, again, an interchangeable morass of mafia values and empty political promises.  Whose screwing who?  And what are the politicians doing with their evenings?  It's not surprising to anyone.  Nor is the element that brings Bats into the middle of all of this human waste.  Bodies are stacking up, clues are being left, and it is clear that Gotham has a serial killer in its midst.\n\nWhat disappointed me greatly is that this isn't played as a mystery.  Batman works with Commissioner Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) to put the clues together to find a madman who calls himself The Riddller who, when he isn't leaving videos of his crimes, leaves cryptic messages teasing the police and eventually Batman himself.  What does Riddler want?  It's not all that surprising.  As I say it's not a mystery.  We know who the killer is and what he wants right from the beginning and so it's kind of a long, slow journey getting there.\n\nWhat mystery resides in the film come from the characters, mainly Salina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz) whose reasons for wanting to infiltrate the viper's nest of the city's criminal empire yield possibly the film's only real surprise.  But, at least she has a function in the movie.  I never could figure out the role of Oswald Copplepot (Colin Farrell, buried under a heavy rubber fat suit) who works closely with the mob but seems to be part of this movie as a bit of character recognition.\n\nI'll be honest, I didn't enjoy this movie.  There's a lot to admire but there is not a lot of entertainment in it.  It's sour and bleak and disturbing.  When Batman confronts the serial killer toward the end of the movie, it gave me the same queasy feeling that I had during the more disturbing scenes of Joker \u2013 that's not a good thing.  I guess that's the way of things in this post-COVID world.  Things have to be sick and disturbing rather than entertaining.  The Batman wallows in an atmosphere of rotting dread for so long that you find yourself begging for a little sunshine.  Please!  Somebody!  Anybody!  Tell a joke!  Throw a pie!  For Heaven sake, even Hamlet had a comedy relief!",

You don't realize just how bad The Batman is until you compare them. The story is horrible because there is just nothing to it. Nothing really happens. There is no character development. The actors are just used as props to move around and spit out horrible long-winded dialogue. It's a shame because the Riddler should have been an amazing nemesis. Instead, we get what feels like a really boring video game where the Riddler leaves a clue, Batman takes a while to figure it out and then when he does that leads to about ten minutes of exposition delivered by one of the other characters. This entire script feels like one long very boring exposition.  The one positive is that the casting was pretty good.

His outstanding cast (where the performances of Zo\u00eb Kravitz and Colin Farell stand out) is one of the strengths of the film. The photography and the decadent representation of the gothic city are a delight and a hypnotic tool within the film.

It wasn't my cup of tea.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't as great as people are making it out to be.  I'm not sure if it made anyone else anxious, the way Selina at the end puts cats in cat carriers and attaches that to a motor-cycle.  Those poor cats, how miserable would they be in  a cold hard carrier with no windows, sloshing around every time Selina makes a turn? Plus it was raining, I feel like if the cat has air-holes, the cat is wet at this point.  I really didn't like that imagry, there.  Over-all, I wouldn't see it again.

It looks like he's stalking some wealthy family. And apparently it's Halloween. Dude\u2026 the way Riddler appears out of nowhere right behind the mayor. That was so eerie and creepy. Brilliantly executed! You can tell The Riddler is a complete sadistic psychopath in this movie, someone to really fear. Definitely not inspired so much by Jim Carrey's version. I'm loving the aesthetic and look of this Batman movie. Reminds me a lot of the tone of Se7en. Definitely a darker looking movie then the other Batman's in terms of brightness. And I like that a lot. It sets it apart from the rest. I also really like how grounded in reality this Batman is. Interesting how people in this world don't see Batman as a hero or a protector. They see him more as a threat or a liability. \n\nThis Batman is a lot more moodier, grungier, and even maybe a bit emo. That contact lens technology was pretty awesome. It records everything he sees. Awww, Andy Serkis is Alfred! That's so good. Waaaoooow! All the gothic architecture throughout Wayne Manor is gorgeous! Dude Colin Ferrel looks insane as the penguin! He's almost unrecognizable under all the prosthetics and fat suit. I don't care what anybody says about him, he's a great actor. That rat torture contraption around the guys head looked insane! I've never seen that before. That scene with Selena going into the lounge wearing the contact lens was masterful. \n\nThat's hilarious how the same officer, Martinez, loves and admires Bruce Wayne at the funeral procession but despises Batman when he sees him at the crime scene. Jesus Christ, that car chase sequence was insanely good. Bat's car emerged out of that fire like a bat out of hell! That was amazing. I think I can say without a doubt that this has been the best Bat mobile to date. It's like a customized Mustang or muscle car. It looks so sick. I want it. I love Paul Dano's innocent little child-like smile. \n\nI think my favorite part about this movie is how it plays out like a Mystery/thriller and how grounded it is as a superhero movie. Beautifully cast and terrifically acted. The violin-tinged soundtrack really compliments the tone of the movie nicely. Dark spaces are used wonderfully throughout the movie, either serving as an entrance for Batman or a reminder for criminals that he could be lurking in the shadows. I love how the movie serves as a reminder of all the corruption and greed that lies within the powers of government, law and the wealthy. There's a surprisingly good amount of humor throughout the movie that comes out of nowhere very unexpectedly, and I love it. Overall, this Batman movie was an amazing and fresh addition to the line of other Batman movies that already exist. It's definitely one of my favorites up there with Nolan's trilogy and it definitely deserves a rewatch.",

The movie is slow, the characters do not really make you care about their outcomes, and the actor playing the lead role displays what could be considered the worst work of his career.  I'm not a Robert Pattinson hater.  I've enjoyed him in other movies and I know he has talent.  He just didn't bring it with him when he did this particular movie.  Besides Pattinson, the rest of the cast is almost as abysmal.  Of course, one could also blame the writers.  Actors can only do so much with a rotten script.  I seriously wanted to like this movie.  I enjoy when a director or writer or actor can put a new spin on a subject that may have become old and predictable.  Instead, \"The Batman\" remains old and very, very predictable.  The only slightly positive part of \"The Batman\" is the portrayal of Catwoman by Zoe Kravitz.  Her costume is another story.  Whomever was in charge of wardrobe for this movie looks like the hit a thrift store for their inspiration.  Catwoman's mask/headgear looks like a ripped winter toboggan.  Even with the horrible costume, Kravitz is the one actor in the movie that actually makes me care slightly for her character and I want to root for her to come out on top.  Colin Farrell was wasted as the Penguin as layers and layers of makeup and a fat suit made him have to act like he was wearing one of those Sumo wrestling suits you see at parties and events.  Much the same with Paul Dano's Riddler.  The new costume was interesting, but it was never explained why he chose to disguise himself in what looked like a duct-taped helmet and raincoat.  Just another example of poor planning for a very poorly-executed movie.  2022's \"The Batman\" could have been such a good movie, but it fails on so many levels, it's one of the worst movies I've ever had the displeasure to see.",

Others might like it but for me, it was meh. The Riddler, some may call it a reinvention, others like me call it being WAY out of character. I've always pegged the Riddler as one of the less savage of Batman villains but they upped the violence factor with him and it comes off as kinda unsettling. The Penguin, they completely nerfed his character in this movie and made him into more of a two-bit thug, mid-tier villain when the Penguin is well known for making an impact. Not a lot of him you'd see and it's kinda disappointing.\n\nGood spots in the movie: Catwoman, I've always preferred Selina Kyle as an anti-hero or outside help for Bruce Wayne but she makes a good enough presence to become a major factor in the movie. The Falcone & Maroni rivalry, it's explained well in deep detail and Don Falcone has quite a character in the movie which makes him for a charismatic bad guy. He also becomes an integral plot point in the motivation of The Riddler and gives a backstory of Bruce Wayne's parents before their deaths. Alfred Pennyworth, I've grown to love his former military background when it became a part of his personality in the Gotham TV series and it works well to his character in this movie as well, something that's needed to keep the more bratty and impulsive Bruce Wayne under control.\n\nAll in all it's a decent movie but I thought it dragged on a little more than usual.",

It was a bold move; let's start this like a horror movie and let it settle in to action-super hero while never letting the audience be completely at ease. Some of the other factors were unfortunately not as great. It was much too long and for all the wait, the ending was not the high point of the movie. While not an insufferably woke film, there was some woke hanging around in the back alleys of Gotham City that was hard to avoid for the caped crusader. \n\n*minor spoilers*  It was surprising to see how the character who had the most negative perception by other characters was not the anonymous and violent vigilante, but Bruce Wayne. None of those characters had ever met the young Wayne, of course. He was, despite being an orphan through a violent homicide, mostly a detestable rich kid billionaire. People either resented the soft-landing of being rich despite obvious, horrific trauma or they had other uses for him and he just wasn't serving their causes (politician Bella Real). It's hard to take it any other way except that Batman should expect to be always defending Bruce's white, privileged status and upbringing. The police on the other hand thought batman was a creep and a weirdo resulting in frequent altercations, insults and distrust. Also, the ultimate result of Batman's vigilante nights is not a safer Gotham, but the inspiration for violent internet chat room creeps who grab guns and start an insurrection (see where this is going?)\n\nThus, is the state of the Bat universe in 2022.  Patterson's Batman really doesn't have a lot to say in defense of his character, Bat or Wayne, so we'll have to see where future screenwriting leads. Hopefully in a far shorter sequel in 2024 where perhaps Bruce Wayne is more accepted as a wealthy, but inoffensive introvert who enjoys halloween all year long!",

He isn't larger-than-life, he's got a more believable backstory, and his sense of anger and outrage fits in with an alarming amount of people out there today. His rantings, his reactions to Batman rebuffing him in Arkam, you can believe it all. He's a mentally ill psychopath.\n\nThe problem for me is that while he is a believable psychopath...he's not The Riddler. He doesn't fit the source material being adapted at all, and AS a comic book fan, that really bothered me. Additionally the pacing made the movie feel a bit dull, and Robert Patterson made an acceptable Batman, but a lousy Bruce Wayne.\n\nBig points for Colin Farrell as The Pinguin, though.

Zoe Kravitz showed us an absolutely 10/10 performance as Catwoman and i dare to say that she was the best Catwoman so far. Paul Dano was also top of the top in terms of performance and showed us that The Riddler can be truly terrifying. Other members of the cast did a good job too but these three really stood out. Overall good movie.",

Before you berate me for not seeing it in the theater, my wife hates Marvel and DC movies, so there was zero chance I was going to the movie theater to see it. I knew it was coming out on HBO Max after it's theatrical release so I knew I'd see it soon enough. Not to brag, but I've got a X950H Sony Bravia TV which is incredible (85\" 4K) and a new Sonos Arc, Sub and rear S1 speakers (an amazing system, way better than the Pioneer Home theater system I spent twice as much for). My point is I saw the movie as close to theater quality as I was going to get. BTW, my wife agreed to give the movie a chance and didn't move for almost 3 hours, she loved it.\nBack to The Batman. I'm a huge fan of Christopher Nolan's reboot of the Batman franchise. Christian Bale was amazing.\nThis Batman is not Christopher Nolan's Batman. Hell his batmobile looks like someone shoved a GE jet engine into the trunk of a 69 GTO. He barely has any cool tools, but it doesn't matter.\nThis Bruce Wayne is angry and he is out for vengeance. He's driven by it. But he also has a soft side. When an important man is killed (I'm trying to avoid spoilers) you can immediately see the empathy he has for the dead man's son. \nThis is a Batman on the edge of self destruction. He is without a true purpose. As the film unwinds, this state of mind is directly responsible for much of the decay of Gotham. \nPattinson's brooding, angry Batman is spot on. He's only been Batman for 2 years and without the guidance of Alfred he definitely would have self destructed. All of this unfolds seamlessly and it is incredibly compelling.\nThose that are critical are longing for the Nolan Batman. Slick, bad ass and up to his eyeballs in the best munitions and tech. That is not this Batman. We are witnessing the rebirth of a man. A man who just happens to be Bruce Wayne and Batman. \nThe co-stars are perfection. Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman Is insanely beautiful and her character is one step above amoral. Jeffery Wright as Gordon is powerful and completely understated, he is probably the only true good guy in the movie. My only gripe was that Andy Serkis as Alfred isn't featured more prominently. I suspect that will change as the franchise moves forward. \nThe real standout here is Paul Dano as the Riddler. I won't go into the relationship between he and Batman but needless to say this is not the standard good guy vs bad guy scenario. Dano's performance is creepy to perfection.\nIf you want to see cool gadgets and insane explosions, rewatch the Dark Knight series (I am not putting it down, it also went deep into Wayne's psyche). But if you want a compelling drama with some cool action thrown in, see this movie.",

The character Batman didn't had emotion ( let's not forget that Batman it's just a person with a lot of technology and equipment).. this new Batman stunned me with emotion.. movements, words. It was very good contoured. \nThe city was detailed af. \nI indeed didn't like too much the character Alfred, perhaps we are used to an older version. \nRiddle should win the Oscar. \nNice movie",

He is able to add so much depth to the character and conveys emotion as no other Batman has ever done both with and without the mask. Whilst Zoe Kravitz was captivating as Catwoman, there is a lack of chemistry between her and Pattinson. I also found a lack of connection between Serkis and Pattinson but Wright and Pattinson make a great duo. The action sequences were done very well, in particular, the car chase sequence was very thrilling. Overall it was a wonderful watch and I can't wait to see Pattinson's next portrayal of the Batman.",

Pattinson's Batman is a shark for justice. Afraid that any touch from another human being, other than fist to face, might turn him back into a man who must feel. He can survive bullets, but never feelings. Pattinson conveys more than most actors in a sustained longshot, with nothing more than clenched jaw and the whites of his eyes. He may dispense justice like the sledge hammer we fantasize being, but he can't do what we do. Allow himeslf to love. The loyalty of Alfred angers him. An adoring public bothers him. A kiss. That kiss. It is the superhero's biggest struggle in this story. It disarms the monolith for one moment that exposes his longing for peace and his exhaustion from running away from pain. It is the moment that let me love him. Like all of us, he lets his work consume him and divert his attention. Away from the delusion that it's easier to fix a city than himself and the excruciating doubts about ever being able to find love or comfort among other people. Definitely MY Batman.",

No way this character has the discipline, physical or mental, to be Batman nor the charisma to be Bruce Wayne.  Bring back Ben Affleck! Other gripes include a painfully slow and uninteresting plot that could have been compressed into a 2hr movie.  There's an animated WB version on this movie that is far better.  I could go on.  This movie does a huge disservice to the Batman character and is an awful movie",

Ponderous. \n\nIt was an interesting to see an attempt at a different sort of Batman, but ultimately it doesn't quite work. \"Emo/goth Batboy\" is not a very compelling character, even with that much eyeliner. To his credit, Robert Pattinson did about as well with the character as he possibly could have (and the movie will probably do surprisingly well with young girls). But ultimately Batman should be Bat-*man*. We want a ripped Christian Bale type who can take on multiple enemies in a somewhat believable way.\n\nAs you might expect, this movie follows the modern trend of filmmakers trying to \"subvert\" and effeminize (i.e. ruin) our traditional heroes. This Batman often looks like an awkward, stringy high school student with all the charisma of an awkward, stringy high school student. The film has to try to counterbalance this by going for an extremely dark, gritty, and solemn aesthetic/feel. Unfortunately this has the consequence of making the film a slog, and the runtime of nearly 3 hours doesn't help. \n\nThis film is extremely monotone. The color scale of it is reminiscent of \"The Long Night\" episode of Game of Thrones. Somehow, it's always raining and cloudy in Gotham. Everything is dark, dark grey, in appearance and tone. Everyone always speaks in a slow, gritty, blandly \"dramatic\" voice. There is virtually *zero* light to contrast the copious shade in this movie. \n\nThe film doesn't have much heart to it, or any meaningful levity. For contrast, go back and watch \"the pit scene\" of the Nolan film where Bale escapes the pit. The difference is astounding. Nolan made you feel something, and root for Batman. There's very little in this new film that makes us like, understand, or root for Batman. We aren't really shown what Batman's motivation is. I mean, you might argue \"It's Batman, we already know what his motive is\", but any movie should be able to stand on its own, so that motive should be spelled out and felt by the audience. In this movie, we go right into Batman doing his Batman thing, and we never really see why *this* version of Batman does what he does. The ultimate effect is that this version of Batman is not very believable. \n\nWhat are the merits of the movie? Well, nobody can complain that this movie is too cartoonish, or not serious enough. The Penguin is great. The plot is full of intrigue (although it's arguably a bit too complex and most viewers wont really follow it). The more grounded version of the Batmobile is cool. It is an admirable attempt at a different sort of Batman, but ultimately it leaves something to be desired.",

The Batman phones in the action with blurred backgrounds and verbal explanations of what's happening.  I shouldn't have to say this, but it is always more exciting to see a seawall get destroyed instead of just hearing about it.  And if Bruce really cares about Alfred, how is the first thing he says to him (after Alfred wakes from a coma) is, \"You've lied to me all these years.\"  Lame.\n\nAnd perhaps most importantly, how did they not learn from The Dark Knight Rises that you should be able to hear the dialogue?\n\nI'm looking forward to the other upcoming DC movies, but not sure I'll even bother if there's a sequel to this one.",

So they can skip straight to the story they want to tell with these beloved characters. The batman seen in this movie is one of his youngest iterations. Robert Patterson does a fantastic job, there are moments when you truly see him vulnerable and upset and Patterson does well. This version of the Batman was a lot more reckless and you can tell he is just growing into the role as the city's protector here. The cast was all A-listers and for the most part, it worked. The only one that stood out was Andy Serkis as Alfred, Andy is a little gritty for the role of the uptight and always perfect Alfred Pennyworth but his rendition of the character worked against Patterson's version of Bruce. Other than that I think the cast did very well. Zo\u00eb Kravitz stands out as Catwoman as she brings a lot of vulnerability to the role. Cat woman has always been seen as a sexy aloof love interest for batman. She certainly is that here but Zo\u00eb adds almost an innocent touch that brings the character to life. The role of the cat woman is also aged down to fit against this version of Bruce and it was nice to see their dynamic and how both of them were trying to grow into their vigilante personas. Jeffery Wright as Gordon was a brilliant casting choice, as soon as I originally saw the cast list come out I was thrilled to see his name and he did not disappoint. This version of Gordon isn't as straightlaced as others but I liked that and believed Wright played into that well. The movie was well cast and the visuals were stunning but the story was lacking in certain places. I found myself getting bored a lot of the time and I believe that is partly caused by the 2-hour and 56-minute run time. I did enjoy certain scenes where batman was investigating the crime scenes among actual police officers because we can see the dynamic between the law and \"vengeance\" as they would say in the movies. A lot of the time we would see him enter and leave a scene, so when he did do the famous disappearing act it was all the fun. This version of Batman was said to be a lot darker than a lot of the other versions and I can see that with the actor choices and a lot of the character choices themselves but it didn't land fully due to the film's need to still be pg-13. I believe the two things cannot be balanced. They referred to drugs as these eye drops and every time it was mentioned it completely took me out of the scene. It is not my favorite of the Batman films but it does place itself pretty high on the list. Would recommend it if you are a fan of Batman.",

This incarnation of this Batman is very grounded to make you think and believe that all this is possible in real life while bringing Batman's detailed detective side to a movie like we've never seen. Matt Reeves shows us a Batman that has been this hero for only a short time can make mistakes, reinterpret wrong and still be surprised when things actually happen.

I anticipated a moody film with darker themes and while I thoroughly enjoyed the hauntingly unsettling reimagining of the film's main antagonist, the vibe did grate on me eventually. R-Patts does well as Batman but doesn't create a believable Bruce Wayne. The slow pacing and overused \"the police aren't comfortable with him being around\" set-piece just didn't feel like it added much. \n\nThe run-time felt long and while there were some genuinely great moments (and some beautiful cinematography), I left feeling frustrated.\n\nI don't mind when films run long when they use the time to world-build or backfill character stories (e.g. the Snyder Cut of Justice League), but this oddly felt like a storyboard that could have been slashed to 2hrs and lost very little.\n\nA decent attempt and I enjoyed the first real foray into grim territories with the character, but with so many good portrayals of The Batman on screen already, I do wonder why we keep trying to find a new angle.",

            "content": "Hello good! I can finally review something good, that my last two reviews were about pretty mediocre and forgettable movies. Certainly the bar is really high after Nolan's adaptations, and Bale's interpretations as Batman, and of course Ledger as Joker. However, Rober Pattinson makes a very good interpretation of the Batman, here represented as a young and inexperienced Bruce Wayne, who has been working as a Gotham vigilante for very little. He is a more aggressive Batman, focused on terror, on revenge, a much more detective Batman, more focused on solving the case than beating up the thugs on duty. With a dirtier Gotham, more in the style of the last movie we saw with Joaquin Phoenix's Joker. Most of the performances are excellent, especially the one with the Penguin. Although it is true that it is Marvel that usually makes jokes and humor, generally easy and more adolescent, with the Penguin I genuinely laughed, Gordon fulfills his role very well, he is directly the same character as in Nolan's trilogy, To whom The most I noticed weak was Alfred. The film is enjoyable for the 3 hours it has. It draws you into the ghoulish puzzles and puzzles, and the action scenes, while sparse, are very well choreographed; perhaps it is missing to know where he gets all his artifacts, and his suit, as well as his training, but I imagine that they omitted it because at this point everyone knows Batman and that it was still 4 hours of film. ..\n\nThe technical section is absolutely incredible, the photography is visually powerful and decadent, the music accompanies well, and they took the trouble to translate many of the messages and conversations that should be in English, very good editing job. It has its script holes, of course, and leaves you with a feeling that it's perhaps a bit encapsulated. Perhaps it would have been better to make a series than a movie, because of the director's vision of wanting to tell more than he can cover, throughout the movie there are faint flashes of subplot that could really go for much more, but come on, it's a very enjoyable movie with few script holes, and few bugs. Very very enjoyable, and highly recommended.",

Only during the funeral scene outside did a hint of sunshine lighten up some nearby architecture. And that scene was less than a minute.

Gotham City is truly overrun with corruption and decades old secrets that are revealed this go round. Much of the movie a slow burn sprinkled with evil intrigue and a ruthless madman mastermind moving the plot along. Car chase with the Batmobile was excellent. You gotta love this Batmobile.

The scene where Batman was flying in the air with the suit on the camera trick was last used in the 1950s. Couldn't make it look more believable? Instead let's strap on a selfie stick and cut off the top part of his head and make it look like he's flying. Unbelievable hype for such a wack movie.

All three of the last Batman series with Christian bale had me enthralled and on the edge of my seat.

I found myself checking my phone about an hour in confused as to how there was an hour and a half left - I thought it must almost be over.  The worst Batman movie I've seen in my life, but it had so much potential.  The writing, fighting, the protagonist, and overall story is what makes it so bad but the acting was also pretty weak besides a few good characters.\n\nThe cinematography is actually beautiful, I love the city building (even though Gotham shouldn't be NYC, it should be in NJ and its own city... but alas, these details can be debated), it had a semi-noir vibe to it which I actually think could've been darker but was cool... but overall, the acting was pretty weak.  The actual imagery was dark and hard to see almost, but by darker I mean it could've been more noir/the vibe could've been scarier.  It was close, though, on vibe.  Zoe Kravitz was good, but they just made some weird choices in the script with Catwoman and IMO the action/fights were terribly choreographed.  Them making Batman more of a detective was pretty cool, but I found the whole Riddler character to be weak at best, really not scary at all even though he was supposedly doing all these bad things and controlling the story behind the scenes.  Idk, just felt like a high school project for 2 and a half hours with Hollywood behind it.  Just didn't feel like Batman on top of that.  Wasn't a great story either and wasn't wrapped up, like they actually plan on making more of these?  They actually want that Riddler character to keep being the main protagonist?   \n\nThe most noticeable stuff were just bad choices in plot lines, easily noticeable plot holes many times in the movie, loose ends and side plots that don't make sense (um, what happened to Alfred and why did he just drop out from the movie), disconnects from the true Batman storylines, but worst was the inconsistencies of how Batman acted/fought/and the technologies he used.  As a billionaire detective-like Batman, you'd think he would use technology more... he had some super high tech contact lenses but instead of using a drone to search a building, he goes into some abandoned building with another guy and just walks around and gets into a bad situation.   I know he's supposed to be a genius, but him solving riddles immediately but then later getting basic parts of it wrong... idk just felt weird and stupid.  Alfred cracking some secondary code that didn't really make sense to get the word \"DRIVE\" which lead him to a random car... just none of it really tied together.  Lazy and bad writing should have no place in a big production or in something meant to be psychologically stimulating.... \n\nThe Batmobile is just a semi-normal looking car from decades ago, with a jet engine on the back, that somehow can just plow through other cars, trucks, buildings, etc, and breaks the rules of physics.  Then there is the most cringey part in the glide suit... the way he fights to not kill and somehow has infinite grappling hooks that come from nowhere to hang guys from the ceiling instead of kill them while just walking through machine gun bullets that seem to magically bounce off his suit.  An explosion in his face doesn't even scratch his exposed skin somehow despite throwing him across the room.  At one point he jumps onto a falling part of a building and uses his batarang to cut a wire, and falls with the chunk of hanging metal and miraculously survives, rather than just being Batman and throwing the batarang at the cable... Batman starts to fight a room full of cops who didn't unmask him for some reason while he was passed out but is able to escape the precinct - almost no reason to even have this scene.  I mean, its like they never saw Batman fight before.  He is stealthy, he doesn't just walk up to guys and start fighting them, and they almost always had him walk up and walk through bullets like superman and almost never sneak attack people.\n\nAs far as Bruce Wayne goes, this depiction just makes no sense.  He doesn't fit the character at all.   This was part of the movie that just made it terrible as far as being a Batman fan goes but wasn't even majorly focused on... further, the Riddler knows and possibly reveals who he is which shouldn't happen.  Oh, and don't mention that he's physically way too small to be Batman and doesn't even look like Bruce Wayne has ever been depicted, in facial structure.  I just don't believe he is Bruce Wayne or Batman at any point in the movie.\n\nI'd give this high school level writing, Hollywood level cinematography, just poor casting for Batman and some other characters, and overall the acting was bland and not great but not noticeably bad either.  The storyline was super weak and drawn out, this movie could've shaved an hour off and been better.  Would not really like to see any more of these made but will probably have to watch them because there won't be another Batman reprise for another decade.",

My complaints are minor - I'm not a huge Paul Dano fan despite liking him in this role and a couple other small things - but none of them come even close to jeopardizing any aspect of how great this movie is.

Not worth watching at home on tv-(I can usually stomach crap/average films when seen at the cinema). That said, I went and saw the Batman with a mate of mine at the movies and still had a strong desire to doze off throughout. Nonetheless my friend enjoyed it whilst I did not.

The build-up is there but either through the script or direction the actual reveal/moment of surprise and shock/the moment that draws the audience in,  is ruined every time in one way or another it just doesn't have any oomf to it. \n\nThe writing is very poor in some areas and in others feels out of place, lending many scenes to be lacking in context or leaving them to feel nonsensical. The movie is also long but lacking in substance, much of the ending feels dragged out and could have been trimmed.\n\nThe fight scenes leave much to be desired and feel as anti-climactic as the rest of the movie, if you were to compare them to previous batman films they would not hold their ground.\n\nPros: The Riddler, Gordon, and The Penguin were all well acted and scripted. They went for a more realistic touch sometimes.\n\nCons: Batman looks like he'd have trouble lifting a box of cat litter; I read an article that Pattinson refused to take PEDs for the role and good on him but fuck he has no muscle definition at all, every scene without him in the suit he looks like he could get beat up by a 14yr old, the man could have at least worked out. Cat-woman's entire role feels very forced. They went for too realistic a touch sometimes and then immediately jumped back to nonsense like the writer kept drifting in and out that he was writing a batman script. \n\nIn my personal opinion, comparative to the previous batman movies(yes the 90s ones too) this one by far has both the least entertainment value and replay value. It starts off strong but by halfway through you will just kind of be waiting for something exciting to happen for the rest of the movie and then it ends really awkwardly.",

For the exception of Cat Woman, none of the characters were sympathetic, nor likable (including our mopey Batman), it seems, Gotham city has no good, happy people living in it, a regular depress, cesspool of evil and corruption, (counting Bruce Wayne's father???). The dialogue were long and ponderous. The scavenger, puzzle mystery scheme in itself, seemed overly simplistic and silly, more CSI meets Phantom Of The Opera than a Batman narrative, with lots of morose, mood inducing imagery taken right out of \"Seven\". The production designs and costumes were laughable (specially the Riddler's Son of Sam attire). The action scenes were average at best, and you never got that welcomed uplifting hero's moment, I stop caring, and watched with horror that I had two more hours to go\u2026 An excessively long, drab movie, in tandem with the snail pacing, made for sleepy time and torturous viewing.",

Can't believe they are going back to Ben Affleck but DC never got things right since The Dark Knight trilogy anyways. People who say this was better than the Dark Knight trilogy are just dreaming. Yes this standalone Batman movie was dark and gritty but the casting could have been much much better. IMO I don't think Robert Pattinson had the machismo of Batman let alone the deep voice that Batman is supposed to have. And what was up with the Batmobile it looked like Mel Gibsons car from Mad Max... The car and motorcycle were pretty ghetto unlike Christian Bales in the Dark Knight and it wasn't even close. It's like they didn't even try to make the Batmobile or motorcycle cool with any gadgets. It felt like this was a medium budget movie and they spent most of the budget on the end scene with all the flooding water. Dark Knight trilogy was still miles better... Zoe Kravitz was pretty good although they did not even give 2 minutes to do some kind of flashback for her origin story... but like the Batmans costume, hers was not great. It's like Matt Reeves purposely made their costumes ghetto? Her mask was just a piece of cloth over her eyes, while Anne Hathaway's suit and mask from Dark Knight were sleek and sexy(Hathaway probably just had better curves since Zoe is petite, flat and super skinny). The Batman suit was much skinnier compared to Ben Affleck's in Justice League, which doesn't make sense if he's continuously shot in the chest at point blank range with ARs and 12 gauge shotguns and he lives perfectly fine. And come on, John Turturro as Falcone? He is more of a comedian, not a crime boss, not intimidating at all lol. There are just too many inconsistencies based on past Batman/Justice League movies for this one off to be considered memorable. One question you should ask yourself is: Would you watch this movie again? Probably not because it is way too long. And yes I watch the Dark Knight trilogy over and over again when it is on HBO or any of the premium channels.",

This leaves me to question \"who in a New York-type city (that is trying to hide a secret identity) is going to change in plain site with all those huge windows uncovered sans blinds or curtains...\" \n\n  Pattinson is far more consumed with \"trying to seem cool\" than giving the character substance and the director seems to like that.\n\nOverall this movie seems like a \"B\" movie with a very high budget and big name actors whom I felt sorry for having to be in this movie at all.\n\nIt was boring, tasteless honestly I fell asleep and had to watch it a second time.\n\n  This movie falls short in so many ways but one of the most obvious is the fact that either the director didn't see \"Joker\" or he ignored it because a masterpiece this was not, in fact there is no elegance whatsoever.\n\nThe only thing that seems to be making it get decent reviews is paid off \"critics\" fan boys and girls because this was a steaming pile of toilet droppings.\n\nSorry but not sorry.",

In previous Batman movies and comics, the Batman is like a fairy tale or a boogyman. People theorize if he even exists. In this movie, he just walks around in plain daylight doing first responder jobs. WTF. Bruce Wayne is an emo simp. This review is basically a rant about why this movie is so bad. This is the worst Batman movie I've ever seen. And I'm genuinely confused as to why people like this movie. After watching the full 3-hour film, I was only entertained for a few brief moments. The scene in the jail with Joker and Riddler was fun. And Catwoman was a highlight for me. If they make a sequel I'm not going to watch it. Or maybe I'll watch it on my laptop while I'm cooking dinner. This movie was bad. It's hard to express how bad. It's Justice League bad.",

Catwoman's spending to much time trying to find her friend that no on knows or cares about was a drag. Trying to fit all these characters in one film was a mistake. Riddler was the only interesting person in this film until he takes mask off and the acting and facial expressions seem amateur . Penguin was ok but not much screen time. Catwoman wasted so much screen time that could of been spent on others. Batman was so boring even worse Bruce Wayne. A few cool fight scenes and fleeing from the cops showing how he fly's in a new way were decent. Carmine Falcone at no point did he seem intimidating . And I felt no connection to Alfred so what happens didn't break my heart. I see they were going for a more realistic movie here with the batman car and more focused on a detective story and more true detective/Seven vibe which and I can appreciate but it just wasn't Directed well or written or maybe both. The one fight scene with batman in the club just seemed off not very cinematic the club music was over powering the fight scene. And overall I just didn't feel the tension most Batman movies give you. There are some cool facts of the Wayne family that are a bit refreshing since its mostly not talked to much about in the films. I'm sure in comics they are but. Just a ok movie. Every Batman movie I have watched multiple times even the bad ones. But I don't see myself ever re watching this mediocre movie.

Watching the movie, I always noticed details from other movies like Seven and Zodiac, which are great movies to be inspired by. Matt Reaves' idea of \u200b\u200bpresenting a more \"emo\" Bruce Wayne was quite brave and worked perfectly, the other Batman movies failed to show this darker side of Bruce, perhaps because none of the other actors would have been able to. Robert Pattinson may not be (yet) the best actor to have played the character, but it's undeniable how amazing he is in the movie. The Riddler for me is the most debatable point, since as in Seven, we have here a villain who appears very little, unlike The Dark Knight, where the Joker appears a lot (to the point of seeming that the movie is his), but the little that he appears shows all the talent that Paul Dano has to make this type of character. But despite the focus being entirely on Batman, it didn't stop some supporting actors from appearing, this is mainly the case with Jim Gordon, who has a very important role in the film, being a true support for Batman. Zo\u00eb Kravitz Catwoman is amazing and passionate, her chemistry with Pattinson is really strong. There's also Colin Farrell as the Penguin, who leaves everyone wanting to see more. But what caught my attention the most was the way Batman was evolved, at the beginning of the film we see that he is more of a vigilant, someone who is just wanting to take out his anger, and at the end, he gets real and discovers that he cannot just be a vigilant or \"Vengeance\" he finds that there has to be more. Which makes me very curious about what this Batman will be like in the next movies.",

From the first scene, I was hooked. The key assailants in this fresh take - The Penguin and The Riddler are equally, dark, gritty, ugly, beaten-up looking and not the cartoonish characters of prior Batman movies.  This is a movie that will have you thinking about it long after it ends.  The action sequences are classy and high quality, the story rivetting, shady, dark, and deeply layered, and the scenes are directed and produced to make it look like any of the bad shady neighborhoods of any big city that you are warned not to visit - unless there's a crowd of you.  This is a must see, and will go down as a classic and some ways disturbing interpretation of a hero's story.  See it now.",

It takes a very special skill set and appearance to carry off one of the most iconic roles in cinematic history. Although a very talented actor, I'm afraid that Mr Pattinson has been cast in a role that he is cleanly unable to deliver on to the deliver of many many fans. \nThere are many other far superior actors out there that DC could have chosen. Their choice this time round is pretty pi** poor!!!\nWhy not cast the likes of Idris Elba or Vin Diesel in the role? Excellent choices both physically and vocally.\nThis is definitely not in my watch again list EVER!!!",

Unfortunately the very blah movie almost made the good artwork hard to appreciate. At nearly 3 hours of run time, \"meh\" gets painful, especially considering how badly I wanted to like this, and how much I kept hoping it would get better. Anything moderately good was derivative. And most of the story just made me cringe. \n\nI do give full marks to the props, sets, and costume departments however. The batarang that doubles as the chest symbol was very cool. And the batmobile was pretty cool if far from stealthy. But even here nothing was really original, it was mostly good because it looked like all the great Batman stuff from before.\n\nAs a character, Batman was alright until the final scenes where he was almost totally ineffectual. But Bruce Wayne was almost non-existent, replaced by an emo version of an uncostumed Batman. No genuine pathos from any of the characters. There is nothing truly heroic or worthy of emulation from any of the characters. Our \"greatest detective\" and \"only clean cop\" behave like total noobs when they plug a thumb drive KNOWN to come from a \"devious\" villain into an unsecured police issue laptop. So our heroes are idiots. \n\nOf course so are our villains. The Riddler would be pathetic except that we don't even feel sorry enough for him to get that much. None of his riddles are actually challenging, and he doesn't even manage to be creepy because he's so dumb. The Penguin is nothing more than a common mobster, except that he's not even really good enough to make a good capo on the Sopranos. \n\nAnd Catwoman? She can't seem to decide what she is. I will say that Zoe Kravitz is stunningly beautiful. She fits with all of the other artwork. But the character falls flat, like all of the others in this movie. \n\nNone of the characters suffer any kind of internal crisis or conflict. None of the characters grow or change. They all just bumble around reacting to one another in very predictable ways. \n\nConsidering that this is a superhero movie, about one of the few men to be considered a superhero without \"powers\"... it was incredibly boring. Batman is supposed to be amazing, he ranks with Superman because of his intellect and character (and cool gadgets). But in this movie even the spectacle of a decent car chase was dry because it was \"yep, guess it was time for one of those.\"\n\nAnd no hate on Pattinson or anyone else for the failures in this movie, the faults lie exclusively with the script and direction.  \n\nAlmost everything awful about this movie comes from breaking a very simple rule of good writing: show, don't tell. Don't tell me that Jim Gordon is a good cop, show me him acting like one, the Nolan movies nailed that one. Don't tell me that a pretty young black woman will make a great mayor because she is pretty, young, and black. Show her acting with good sense and strong leadership (and not like a petulant child). Don't tell me that Batman cares about Gotham city. Show me what it costs him to try to make the city safer for kids to grow up in. Show me why that matters to him. Again, Nolan nailed that one.\n\nIn fact, just go rewatch the Dark Knight Trilogy, your time will be far better spent. Myself, I will try to pretend that this one doesn't exist in the cannon of Batman movies. Well, come to think of it, nothing significant actually happened, so that's easily accomplished.",

This is right up there with the best of them for me, if not the best. It was a dark gritty noir that kept you intrigued from start to finish, the 3 hours almost went by too quickly tbh.  Can't wait for the next one, I imagine/hope it'll be Barry Keoghan as the Joker. \nAlso, playing Bruce Wayne as this sad kind of emo character was actually perfect! How else would that human be in real life after all he's been through!

Despite Bruce Wayne's amazing capabilities, he had to start from scratch some where.  We see a great noir detective movie rather than a superhero genre.  Robert Pattinson delivers a more tangible Bruce Wayne and realistic beginner Batman.  His acting shows a complete separation of the two characters.  His body language and fight style show a rough around the edges, taking several blows and by no means a master of his craft, yet.  Andy Serkis delivers a great Alfred, despite his limited lines and screen time.  Andy definitely has more to offer and future story arcs for this character.  Zoe Kravitz  also delivers, arguably, the best Catwoman/Selina Kyle. Yes, better than Michelle Phifer.  It was refreshing to show Batman's intelligence but key moments that he is still learning his thought process, strategy, and skills.  My only note that left me disappointed, was a scene where Batman is brought back to a police station after being knocked unconscious.  When Batman awakes, his cowl is still on his head.  I found this the only moment that let me feeling \"yeah right?\"",

If I were to rate this film on Robert Pattinson's, as well as the writers, and directors gritty portrayal of a scarred, emotionally troubled Bruce Wayne, I would place this movie at the top of my list. I believe they created the most accurate version of this character, which is an intelligent, emotionally flawed man, with a singular purpose. To undo what can't be undone. The utter lack of shiny, brand new toys, and tech that all of the previous versions of this character has had, in films, is what I've wanted to see for decades.

I'll start by saying that the concept was pretty cool, I liked the dark serial killer esque vibe from the riddler and Robert Pattison's portrayal of the caped crusader surprisingly exceeded my expectations (they weren't too high to begin with) but that was it. The film has so many more flaws that the few praises are simply not enough to keep it afloat (pun intended)\n\nThis was a clear example of DC's use of recycled efforts to deliver a film in a desperate attempt to try and overthrow Marvel and what they are currently dominating. It didn't feel like there was anything new brought to the table whatsoever. The narrations from Robert Pattinson made me think of Rorschach from the Watchmen which kind of gave me a bad impression from the very beginning (I absolutely loved the Watchmen film by the way) and foreshadowed how the remaining 3 hours of The Batman would play out if it's just going to be copying things from other films in the DC universe. Why did it also have to be 3 hours?! This film felt so stretched that it could have quite easily been cut by an hour.\n\nIt is just typical DC, like with Suicide Squad and The Justice League, films so poor that they needed to be remade in such a short space of time because they just couldn't get it right first time. However, why was there the need to re-invent what has already been perfected with The Dark Knight series? Plus Heath Ledger will always hold the throne for his portrayal of The Joker and nobody will ever come close to his performance. Ever.\n\nI also don't understand why this film has gotten such high praise, but after digging a bit deeper I have noticed that quite a lot of people share the same opinion as myself. I guess the \"Top Rated\" reviews have just been fabricated as a part of a marketing facade to try and attract more people to watch the movie in cinemas so that it doesn't flop at the box office. I'm very glad that I did not watch this at the cinema.",

The addition of Paul Dano and Andy Serkis made me smile and their acting is great but the writing seemed to hold back their true potential.

The biggest problem with the movie is that it is about 30 minutes too long. Without spoiling anything, I believe there is a sensible ending that ties up the main mystery of the film and leaves the main villain's character motivation intact. The ending that they chose for the movie pursues the generic anarchy motivation that many villains have which was not sensible given the context of the film.

            "content": "The Hook; an essential part of getting the reader's attention, as in this case, the viewer's attention, is magnificently achieved in this action film, and thusly pulled me in from Jump Street. I was willing to suspend my disbelief in the whole world of DC's Gotham, but alas, the tropes started pouring in. The use of just one guitar chord in the soundtrack as Batman walks toward the Penguin, trapped hanging upside down in his demolished car, hints at all the Robert Rodriguez grindhouse splatter ever made and had me shaking my head.\n\n\nWe follow the scars as they are covered by his shirt only to reveal the point of a cathedral common room in the Manor, The Martre's entrance. I would have settled for the kid staring back at me from the video of the previous night's patrol, to tell the story of what matters most to Bruce, but no, this is a hero story, hence the Sainthood dry-rub. By now, that's a foregone conclusion to this fan base, isn't it?!\n\nThe shift of dominance in roles has disheartened me greatly and enough to warrant considerable star erosion in this review. Jeremy Iron's portrayal of Alfred is more a tour de force in actually influencing his Bruce Wayne, which naturally would be the case, shedding new light on a facet of Alfred's story purpose - that is not enlightened nor awakened in any respect here. Andy Sirkis has his cajones roped in the opener, and it is a sign his hands are just there to be wringing over the pain he sees in master Bruce's eyes than actually building gear and pressing suits. To my utter dismay, Andy Sirkis' portrayal got nothing but worse after the initial scene, descending into a castration of character the likes of which I've never seen in a Batman movie. His limp reaching out for the hand of his master was flinchingly horrible. Alfred is an NPC, as we say in gamedom, in this movie and that accounts for most of the missing stars in the rating of this film.\nIt is an enthralling portrayal of Batman as he starts to find his footing in his second year as Gotham's lone vigilante. He is a brooding and dark figure, struggling with the rage he still feels, having witnessed his parent's brutal murder. He is stretching his muscle, finding his strengths, and exercising his demons. I give Pattinson's performance a 'B' for its convincing representation of Bruce Wayne as a somewhat young orphan grappling with relationships, his fears, and a woman's fierce and focused attention. The subject of which is also the cause of the erosion of star quality in this review. The elements within the love interest story were the most captivating and magnetic aspects of this plot. His treatment of this female character is demeaning though, as though a petulant heir apparent at The Manor were not getting his way with a disobedient nanny. I'm glad he didn't team up with her at the conclusion; the potential for her character is so much greater without him, even as a spin-off. The basic detective plot lost its interest with the way in which the names of the gangsters got me confused and it just wasn't as interesting as the slim beauty in the skin-tight suit, nor the Batmobile itself! I didn't know which Tony was the bad guy or the good, which eroded the rating even more. My understanding is that this director gets his three shots at the trilogy as well and my sincere hope is that more entanglements with female interests continue - it is the best of this rendition of our hero. It is a vision of Batman, that although dark and shadowy as the character himself, also offers us the light of relationship at the bottom of a very black crevasse, a crevasse we can not help but lean over the edge of to peer down into.\nColin Farrel's Penguin was a top-notch character acting job, as is expected from him always, and the casting of Paul Dano as Riddler worked as a very unstable villain. When I saw the actor's face I thought of the disturbed young man who menaced everyone in There Will Be Blood, provoking me to a verbal outburst of surprise. I have watched the film many times now and will again many more times as it is thoroughly enjoyable as an action film, with a few tired plot workings and worn-out rhetoric in the dialogue, the biggest crippler being the lack of dimension and depth in two very important characters; Catwoman and Alfred. And this Batmobile is one of the best, not a hell of a lot of bells and whistles just jet engines and beautiful wings for flight.\nMy anticipation of the next iteration of this Batman is high, but I'm wary, as DC's track record is worse than Marvel's in the arena of sequels. I'm always pulling for DC to take this genre to the next level of evocative cinema. Warner has been hit or miss thus far lately; hitting a great social empowerment ceiling with Wonder Woman, but not slamming it home with the follow-up which pandered to an age group and threw the rest of us under the bus. Here's hoping this Batman finds its stride over the next following set of movies with an improvement to the writing of secondary female characters, introducing more villains, love interests, and car chases. This film would be an advantageous point at which to unfurl the full breadth and width of the DC Extended Universe flag. Let's see which way the wind blows in the excursion ahead for this franchise.",

It is understandable that a movie about introducing Wonder Woman & Batman along with Superman to set up justice league may take 3 hours (like in BvS), but a great solo Batman movie could easily be done within 2 hours. This movie could be easily 30-40 mins short. It was a very slow burn type of movie which could be better for streaming rather than theatrical release.\n\nSecond thing I want to address that it is just a good movie like other 100 good movies out there. It lacks something special to stand out in the crowd. Certainly it is not as memorable as the Nolan trilogy, but I could not feel the charm of the character Batman in this movie. May be because of the world batman leaves in, too hyper-realistic. I would rewatch old Tim Burton's batman movies multiple times than this one. Batman is a comic book character where fantasy elements present in his world, although batman does not poses any superpower himself. This movie works as just a standalone movie. This movie certainly does not belong to the larger DC universe where other prominent DC characters can interact.\n\nThe positives of this movie can be the acting. All are good actors and their performances shine here. Cinematography was also good along with the music.",

Kravitz, you should never had agreed to do this role with this writing.

As a sci-fi book author, and collector of comic books since the 80s, let's say I'm definitely a big fan of Batman. The first 20 minutes of the film was emo af and as aspected, Robert Pattinson doesn't embody the legacy of Batman - he isn't that muscular or built up (however any Batman movie is better than Zack Snyder catastrophe of a movie with Affleck walking like a Zombie in a malfunctioning Iron Man suit), and he is still Twilight sickly pale. All of this said to me, \"no no no,\" this is NOT Batman. Yet, nearly half way into the film, it won me over. Here's why: the rich and emotionally complex narrative that informs on growth and social intelligence is a joy to watch. Seeing Pattinson riding a motorcycle with a backpack on - that doesn't feel like Batman. And it's not. This is something new. For diehard fans of the Batman character I would advise this: don't go into the theater or stream this expecting a superhero movie. This is NOT a superhero movie. This is an indie-film with IFC vibes all the way. What impressed me was the director, Matt Reeves, took the time to show Batman's vulnerable side, allowing to break the mold into a dynamic character as The Batman hurts, grows and learns from his pain and decides ultimately to become a better person than the one who solves every problem with violence at the end of a batarang. WARNING: this is not a Batman film. It is it's own creation. Not really adding to the canon of the Batman legacy as I don't get Batman vibes from this movie. Nor would I recommend it to anyone who is in the mood to see a superhero movie. Sure, it's dark and complex like other Batman movies but to the degree that Reeves completely changed who Batman is, that's not really Bruce Wayne anymore. The caped crusader here is willing to re-learn how to handle trauma an deal with his emotions in a very post 21st century way. The soundtrack really adds to the emo vibes and it's modern in a social way that none of the other Batman films are. I really enjoyed it. But, it is not a superhero movie.",

You could watch this at 1.5x speed and it would be more enjoyable. This needed at least 20 mins cut out and much faster storytelling. And the constant whisper dialogue in most of the film became annoying really fast.\n\nI do like Pattinson as an actor, but not as Batman in this one. He wasn't convincing and his monotonic whispering dialogue and Emo demeanor was very lackluster to the point of cringeworthy. And that's him both as Batman and even more so as Bruce Wayne.\n\nAnd what's with Colin Farrell being cast with all these prosthetics to play the Penguin? Was every other actor that naturally has that character's look unavailable? It's not like Farrell has a particular set of Penguin skills lol. Casting Farrell as Batman and Pattinson as Penguin, now that would've worked much better imo.\n\nI'm also a big fan of Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, but here again, he was very unconvincing as Gordon, especially when he also had that monotonic whispering Emo demeanor. I get that director and joint writer Reeves was going for that dark lonely dreary theme, but instead, the characters looked bored and inexperienced actors with sore throats.\n\nThe only one that nailed their character perfectly was the lovely and beautiful Kravitz, who stole the entire show. I would've rather watched a 4+ hour movie with just her as Catwoman.\n\nAll the Affleck, Keaton, Bale, Kilmer and even Clooney Batman characters were much more convincing, as well as having more and better \"keep you awake\" action in said films.\n\nSadly, this one is a generous yet disappointing 6/10 from me.",

I think they realised that they made a mistake. Because if the movie is 2 years of Bruce Wayne becoming a batman, then why is Joker already in prison in Arkham asylum and already got the virus disease the same as in the video game Batman Arkham City? If Joker already is Arkham and already got the virus disease, then Batman should be NOT 2 YEARS BECOME A BATMAN. He should be using more advanced gadgets and technology, and the Batmobile should be handsomely rich, not some kind of fast and furious car. \nplus in the movie, I did not feel the billionaire Bruce Wayne there. He seems like the same other people in Gotham city especially when he arrived at the funeral.\n\nIf you have watched the movie, now try to find out who is Batman saves in the movie. so far, I found that he only saves one (early in the train scene) and only answers the riddles, yet the riddles have also been helped by the Joker, still did not find the answer.

It's definitely different compared to Christian Bales batman movies but it doesn't mean it makes it better. It drives for a more detective side of Batman I suppose from all the investigating he does. The riddler was surprisingly good but looked goofy as hell in that costume but his morals were definitely interesting when it contradicted that of Batman himself. \n\nThe fight scenes were really cool and you could sometimes feel the punches delivered by Batman to his foes. But if i'm being honest the only 2 good fight scenes were the end fight and near the beginning when he says \"I'm vengeance\". Nothing much to say about the action, the car scene when he revs the engine and starts it up was really cool and I see the hype for that. However the chase scene was mediocre at best, the close ups were prolonging and half the time you couldn't see what was going on because they obviously tried using realistic lighting with CLOSE UPS in a CAR CHASE. I don't know what was going through their mind during that but it may have worked if they did long shots and not the overbearing penguin face cams. \n\nThe characters had no proper individuality about them, falcone was there and was used for plot means (obviously) but there wasn't much behind his character, nor with selena kyle. They never once explored her past or even try to create something. It seemed that this Batman was trying to retread previously made material and observations. \n\nI've said more cons than good to support my claim that it was a good movie. It was, I loved its whole theme and how Batman looked and what they're going to do with him but it's very obvious they're trying hard to be different than the batmans before Robert. The cinematography was beautiful in some scenes and Gotham looked amazing in the fist few shots of the film. \n\nAlso Alfred was as useless as trying to teach my dog how to sniff out a drug dealer. My man had no significance only for him to be blown up and have a short scene with Bruce that had little emotional connection with the audience.",

Fans of goth, punk and noir will fund much to appreciate here. One aspect I did have a lot of trouble with is the portrayal of Catwoman in relation to \"The\" Batman. To put it bluntly, if Batman were real, he'd be raising all the red flags that he's the kind of guy you want to run a mile from, from the totally creepy way he spies on Selina with binoculars while she's getting changed, to the careless way he just gruffly orders her to look at a certain man (while he's using her body to look through her eyes no less with special contact lenses) even though it places her in serious danger. Especially problematic is the tired, offensive trope that suggests Selina is in a relationship with another woman until, of course, she meets \"The\" Batman - strong, silent, mysterious - at which point any trace of same-sex orientation is abandoned and she's instantly converted to compliant, submissive heterosexuality. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but I was left feeling as if Catwoman was just a naughty, immature little girl who constantly needs rescuing by \"The\" superior and sensible Batman, even though it's usually Batman's insensitivity and carelessness that gets Selina into trouble. Still, leaving aside the rather bad taste the sexual politics left in my mouth, it was otherwise a very gripping film with strong performances all round.",

And I'm willing to bet the majority of people who decide to see this are not comic buffs either. It is difficult to follow and understand this bland storyline that turned the Batman into an \"Emo\" and the Riddler into a \"Gimp\".\nThe Penguin?? I don't get it. \nCat woman? Michelle Pfeiffer & Halle Berry were better.\nA very weird and strange take on the fictional characters most of us grew up watching and played by (in my opinion) better actors.\nThis is a good example of the lack of imagination and creativity this younger generation of film makers have. \nI've loved watching all kinds of movies all my life and these days I find it difficult to engage and follow most without forcing myself to pay attention and stick through it all to the ending. With most people, unless you have a peeping tom scene or sex scene in it and towards the beginning; just like this one does. You lose interest and the audience all together; so why bother.\nIt lacks dialogue and introduction into what seams to be the middle of a particular storyline that none of us have ever seen. \nSo where does this story of the Batman fit in? I'll wait...\nAfter half a day and falling asleep twice through it, I finally finished watching this awful movie that sucked hours of my life away. It did have a few cool parts I regret to remember. \nThe sound track is good other than that, it doesn't take much to entertain some of you huh. LMAO\nNo matter this is definitely not a movie I can or ever will sit through not even to kill time. It sucks and I'm so glad I did not spend one penny to see it. Yet it still wasted my time and energy, so in a way I still ended up paying way too much for what it's really worth.\nI took this time to speak my mind about this because it really does lack what a lot of \"Great\" movies before it's time had and made a great movie binge worthy, meaning a movie worth watching over and over again without getting old.\nThis movie is not that. It's a one hit wonder on someone else's dime.",

However, the direction this movie went along with Pattersons portrayal of Batman is a new take that has never been seen before, reminding me so much of the Arkham Games. Which hands down is the best anyone will see of Batman. My only Negative being Zo\u00eb Kravitz as Catwoman, they could have at least picked someone who could act ... \n\nI cannot wait to see more of Patterson as Batman, I believe a 2nd movie will cause those against him to want more of him. \n\nThe mood, the scenes and effects are jaw dropping!

This falls into the latter category. Take away all the hype from this film and it's actually pretty awful. A lot of people were tricked into thinking if you like Pattinson in the role that somehow made you a discerning film fan. No, sorry it doesn't work like that. He actually is ok in the suit, but he's an atrocious Bruce Wayne. For someone who worked hard to break away from twilight he certainly does his best Edward Cullen impression here.  The film fails to land on pretty much every level. I didn't want to hate this film, I was excited to see this version. But it's a boring, abysmal mess.

All the child actors became lost and quickly replaced (like the daughter of the character ant-man). 2021 was a big progress with the television series wandavision, there were two child superheroes in this show! But it was a difficult time for the child actors, that got replaced each day by one kid older than them, and by Disney's choice the two characters were killed, what a shame.\nNow this movie shows that we are in a deplorable condition, the first draft of the movie \"the Batman and the Robin\" was great, it really would have showed the world that kids also deserve respect. But by demand of the company Warner Brothers Robin was completely taken down of the film (and the actor that worked day by day hard on the movie discarded like it was a parasite.). We are lucky that the script got leaked, or otherwise we would see the prejudice, but not understand that it wasn't the director's fault, but a company move.\nThe movie is still great, but it feels empty, when Batman is driving the bat-mobile you can feel the lack of the boy wonder driving a bike at his side, when (spoilers) the bomb hits Alfred you can feel that Robin should have been there at his side, (when Batman is on the hospital is obvious that they reused the scene were he demanded Robin to shut up and go back to sleep while he talked with Alfred, but sadly it got edited). The Bruce Wayne of this film was and is criticized and with all right, because he only made sense if he was passing on the crisis that is being a father that wants to be relatable to his kid. \nNot only that but all children on this movie are depicted as sad and annoying little brats that only suffer, a truly sad state to Hollywood.\nNow every time that you see the movie, remember, Robin should be there. All the emotion, character development and dynamics left out.\nThe saddest thing was the Batman and Catwomen kiss scene, were in realty it was supposed to be focused on Robin, jealous of that woman stealing his man, with an entire flashback of the beautiful night Dick and Bruce got to know each other, they had finnaly found love in their life, together, it would have been a masterpiece.\nNow all we can do is show that we want children in our movies, and that we are ashamed of this prejudice happening for years and years at this point. \n#realesetheRobincut",

His outfit is awful. Looks like he's wearing an old gas mask. Looks more like Jason in Friday the 13th than the riddler. And of course they had to tease having the joker in the next film.

This super-noir style of the movie is groundbreaking and works very well with the detective nature of the story, delivering one of the most mature and disturbing takes on the character. It is a gripping story full of suspense that keeps you at the edge of your seat, waiting for the mystery to be resolved during some enjoyable 3 hours.

The Informant, also, only committed the crime of informing on Salvatore Marconi's drug bust. But isn't that a meritorious act? Why is that bad? Late in the movie you learn of another specific crime he committed that deeply affects Bruce Wayne, but the Riddler may or may not have known about that, so there is again no clear sense about why the Riddler needed to murder the Informant. Also, if the Riddler wanted justice, why did he murder the Informant when he was being arrested and led away to jail/prison? One would only do that if they wanted to prevent the Informant from divulging names/secrets. It makes no sense. The people and the Informant who were killed were just \"bad\" people.

This movie is like Seven and Dick Tracy had a gothic teenaged child. And I love it. My only complaint is that WB doesn't seem to care at all about a greater narrative. I wish their DC movies all connected, but it doesn't seem like that will ever happen. For now, we will have to enjoy these awesome offerings as stand-alone stories.

I doubt that I could be motivated to see another Batman if the next one is like this.  It has nothing to do with the actor and everything to do with the writing...even a great actor can only work with the material the writer provides.\nI did not see the entire movie as I missed about 3 minutes for a restroom break, like I said an overly long movie!  My rule for restroom breaks is: \"If the movie is good and I was sufficiently entertained the first time, I usually will see the movie again to see what I missed\", I was not about to waste another 3 hours of my life to see what happened in those 3 minutes and when I returned to my seat it looked like the movie had waited for me.\nVery disappointed overall with the movie, kind of like Batman VS Superman,  what a shame to take something we love and make it something we don't even care about.

The ripped off the Batman: The long Halloween and I would be fine with it, if they sticked with the ending or made some true surprise villain.\n\nEvery single thing Batman or even Bruce is, he is not. He doesn't act like a Playboy, billionaire, philanthropist and yes if you take away his armor he is just a mentally scared emo kid with depression. His Batman persona is just fighting while coming out of the shadows not fighting using the shadows. He is just a walking target practice, who punches the bad guys into unconsciousness. He doesn't strike fear, he just punches. This batman misses everything his love for Gotham, his detective skills, his flare, his motivation and the duality of his personality. He is instead just a zombie who stole the cape and is being lead by the Riddler. Someone, who doesn't know Batman seems to have read the wikipedia article read one popular comic and thought: I can write a  Batman movie.\n\nThe worst thing he did was he walked to the crime scene. He walked! He didn't appear magically, with acrobatics or used some disguise. He straight up walked and people just let him through. I grew up watching batman. I saw noire and whacky batman and even cringe Gotham Bruce. But something deep inside me broke, when I saw THAT.\n\nPlease don't call this move The Batman, because it is everything but that.",

Jeffrey Wright is great in almost all he does and he also doesn't disappoint.  I give it a 4 out of 5 as there could have been a little more humor in the film in my humble opinion.

He did way better then my expectations. loved the scenes from the riddler (the guy that played the false preacher in there will be blood). But more so with the mask and the outfit off!!!! When he had the clear rimmed glasses and those wild expressions on his face with his high pitched rant That was really really good.  but Just not enough screen time with his outfit off.. in my opinion the riddles were poorly thought out and poorly placed in the movie .. It didn't connect to the character or audience in my opinion. \nI swear no joke I didn't know Colin Ferral was the penguin until days after I saw the movie. That's either really good or really bad not sure?  Catwomen was fresh and hip no complaints\u2026  so they introduced a Easter egg thing at the end.. showing the shadow and silhouette of the joker while he was talking to the riddler in Arkham asylum.. the jokers face from what I could see looked really weird. like the cat in the hat movie with mike Myers.. his voice didn't really draw me in \u2026 \n\nP.S days later when I found out Colin ferral was penguin.
