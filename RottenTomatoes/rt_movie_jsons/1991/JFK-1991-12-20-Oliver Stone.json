    "summary": "This acclaimed Oliver Stone drama presents the investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy led by New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner). When Garrison begins to doubt conventional thinking on the murder, he faces government resistance, and, after the killing of suspected assassin Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman), he closes the case. Later, however, Garrison reopens the investigation, finding evidence of an extensive conspiracy behind Kennedy's death.",

It is astonishing how he composes a ridiculous amount of facts, ideas, theories, and evidence into such a smooth and engrossing narrative. The cinematography and editing is brilliant (the film won Oscars for both). The cast is an embarrassment of acting riches, with Kevin Costner turning in a convincing and empathetic performance. His character's closing argument is so beautifully acted (look for the moment when he looks into the camera) and so passionately written and delivered it packs an emotional wallop that will stay with you for days. Whether or not the information presented here is entirely factual is beside the point. Stone's genius here is capturing the national mood and an inherent emotional truth concerning the assassination of JFK: we couldn't possibly believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. We know there is a greater truth out there, and we the American people deserve to know the truth. We owe it to ourselves to question and probe until we get it. A great American classic",

Now, does Oliver Stone pick and choose which facts he wants to include and which he wants to modify (or forgo altogether)? Yes. But this film concerns the single most analyzed and dissected conspiracy theory in human history and Stone does it a great service by providing the viewers with an entertaining and fun 3+ hour ride. The cast (Costner, Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Pesci to name a few) is fantastic. Although Costner received criticism for his New Orleans accent, I didn't find that it took away from the film — I cannot say the same for Dennis Quaid's in The Big Easy. The editing is scattered, but in the best kind of way — it is enough to provide a sense of style but doesn't become distracting. I was pleasantly surprised that we start with Eisenhower's farewell address to the nation, wherein he warns the American people of \"the military-industrial complex\" — yes, he uses that term. This kicks off really what the plot is about: War. Mr. X's (Donald Sutherland) information dump went on for what felt like at least twenty minutes. The reveals were pertinent to the plot and at over three hours already, I'm not sure how Stone could've folded these bits of info into the plot, but it did begin to feel like a parody after a few minutes. I'm a sucker for courtroom drama and a flowing, poignant closing argument is the cherry on top and Costner delivers in every way here. I especially loved him delivering the final line directly into the camera. Let me paraphrase it for you: \"The government hates you and thinks you're stupid.\" Amen. Garrison (Costner) leads his team in an impossible fight to challenge the system, but we must never surrender. Sure, it's long, but JFK, full of French Quarter gay-sex orgies, top-down conspiracies, painted-on thick eyebrows, and Gary Oldman is why we sit down to watch movies in the first place. *Side Note* I now get why the Seinfeld scene with Newman, Kramer, and Keith Hernandez's loogie is even funnier than I thought.",

Twenty Nine years on, we know that some of the accusations rammed down our throats by Stone to the point where we knew they must be true, have in fact, been explained away, but JFK has lost none of its power in spite of this. Even if every theory suggested in the film had been proven wrong in the intervening years with inarguable evidence, Stone's telling of the story would have you questioning it all again. And let's be frank, there is still much of this tale that remains unsolved, shut away from the prying eyes of the public, and some of it just absolutely stinks. The level of research and commitment Stone brings to this (admittedly, that's a level he had to commit to when taking on this project) is staggering, and Kevin Costner's central performance as DA Jim Garrison is a career best. Unsurprisingly, JFK picked up an Oscar for Best Editing, but missed out on the big categories, presumably proving too controversial for the Academy in this respect. It remains a pivotal piece of film making, and gave Stone the opportunity to go on to make the excellent Nixon (1995) and W (2008) which I'm yet to see. JFK is film making at its most important, whether it's giving you all the facts or not, and proves when a director is this focused, they can make you believe anything.",

Some of the characters didn't feel particularly believable, but the acting was reasonable overall. On the other hand, the pacing should have been better. Things didn't need to be dragged out quite so much, and the runtime probably shouldn't have exceeded 2 hours 30 or 2 hours 45 minutes. For example, the husband subplot and some of the flashbacks weren't needed. Furthermore, visually, this film looked ugly, especially the lighting. However, the soundtrack was well done.",

The editing keeps you engaged, while the sheer volume of information that Stone gives you is enthralling. John Williams' gripping score helps keep you in suspense whether someone simply rattling off facts or if an eye witness is recounting their experience in their own words.\n\nStone's direction is impressive for such a mammoth film of impactful legacy and serious subject matter. He constantly finds interesting angles, fascinating framing, and moody lighting. JFK is easily in the upper echelon of Stone's already iconic filmography.\n\nFurthermore, JFK is also notable for its behemoth cast of heavy hitting character actors all delivering mesmerizing performances. Kevin Kostner leads the fray as DA Jim Garrison, who was brave enough to take on the Kennedy assassination case and attempt to bring Kennedy's murderers to justice. Kostner is exemplary as the cool and observant district attorney Garrison. Kostner's shining moment in JFK is the entire finale courtroom sequence, which essentially sees Kostner perform a near hour long monologue of facts in the Kennedy case to convince and inform the American public. It's moving and even brings Kostner to tears in a moving display of human empathy and goodwill towards men. You can tell that Kostner was genuinely touched by JFK's death and memory for this story had to be told. JFK contains arguably Kevin Kostner's greatest performance if you needed any more convincing.\n\nLikewise, Sissy Spacek is wonderful as Liz Garrison. Her portrayal of the unappreciated and tireless wife to Garrison is moving as she had to take care of their children while the world ridiculed her husband and denied the legitimacy of his investigation. Spacek shows range in this more outspoken role compared to her more subtle quiet roles.\n\nYou have to love Joe Pesci as the flamboyantly gay David Ferrie. His paranoid rant in the hotel room with Kostner's Garrison present is genius and prime Pesci going off on everything. Similarly, Tommy Lee Jones pulls off a realistic gay Clay Shaw. Jones finds the heart of this unruly Southern gentleman that is hiding a tremendous secret. You despise Shaw by the end of JFK. Even, Kevin Bacon pulls of a realistic gay character with Willie O'Keefe being a gay prostitute fascist hatemonger. JFK creates 3 notorious gay villains that are just one part in the Kennedy conspiracy.\n\nFor example, Gary Oldman disappears into the role of infamous assassination Lee Harvey Oswald. His Russian accent is perfect and his mannerisms fit Oswald immaculately. You never think that you are not watching the real events play out when Oldman is on screen. He is just that realistic. Additionally, Brian Doyle Murray is gripping and suspenseful as Jack Ruby. Whenever he appears on screen, you always note his presence. \n\nOn the other hand, Ed Asner is vicious and hateful as Guy Bannister. His fearsome fascist Republican is so despicable from the moment Asner appears on screen. Asner provides a Republican venom that feels as relevant now as it did when JFK first released. Asner gives an unforgettable performance that rivals Kostner, Jones, Pesci, or Candy, honestly.\n\nJack Lemmon is funny as the nervous informant Jack Martin. Walter Matthau is great as the blunt Republican Senator Russell Long with his grievances against President Kennedy and off hand remarks about the assassination's likely culprits. John Candy actually acts his greatest dramatic performance in JFK as the New Orleans conspiracy informant Dean Andrews. He chews up the scenery with a flourish of style and accent. I loved John Candy as an actor and JFK demonstrates his versatility. Candy gives one of JFK's best roles honestly and he's only within 2 scenes. \n\nLaurie Metcalf is awesome as Jim Garrison's researcher with an attitude and opinion. Her scene of informing Garrison of her findings at the dinner is excellently acted. Jay O. Sanders is really good as the indignant researcher for Garrison named Lou Ivon. His outbursts are memorable. Even better is Michael Rooker as Ivon's foil named Bill Broussard. Rooker finds a gravitas and seriousness that is rare in an actor. His high caliber performance results in fascinating conversations with Kevin Kostner. JFK also features a nice dramatic turn for Wayne Knight as Numa Bertel.\n\nLastly, I really have to commend Donald Sutherland as the CIA informant X. His acting gives weight to the dramatic reveals he uncovers for Kostner's Garrison. Sutherland plays it stunned by the conspiracy, but he also feels moving as he says The United States is essentially compromised at the highest levels. Sutherland is so wondrous in these roles of informational dispensing like he did in Murder by Decree.\n\nIn all, Kevin Kostner, Sissy Spacek, Ed Asner, John Candy, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, and Donald Sutherland give my favorite performances from all the magnificent displays of acting in JFK. Oliver Stone should be proud of his service to America and creative direction for JFK.",

Even though many films and books have been made on this subject Stone is talented enough to not make this movie feel or look stale. Kevin Costner plays the lead attorney general Garrison who is hell bend on finding the cause behind the great calamity of November 1963. This is a strong performance by an actor who isn't a very good actor. Kevin Bacon is also good in a small role as is Tommy Lee Jones. The English actor Gary Oldman plays Lee Harvey Oswald and there is a physical bearing that cannot be denied between the two men. If you are a fan of political movies and enjoy thrillers there's a lot to appreciate about Stone's film. On the other hand if the JFK subject holds no passion for you, and long films are a chore (and this one is) then JFK wouldn't be the best of choices. ",

            "content": "This is a film based around a conspiracy theory that uses dubious information to back up it's argument but thanks to Oliver Stone's skillful directing and one of the most compelling courtroom scenes I have ever seen the film works. No, you won't necessarily walk away as a conspiracy theorist, at least hopefully not, but you'll be able to appreciate Stone's ability to tell a story that is ultimately entertaining as he brings a colorful cast of characters together to draw conclusions about them and show them engaging in debauchery. This would have been my choice for Best Picture in 1991 because although it is controversial it's an undeniably well made film.\n\nJim Garrison, Kevin Costner, serves as the District Attorney of New Orleans and begins to investigate the Kennedy assassination shortly after it occurs with a team of investigators. He begins to find leads that point to the assassination being an inside job but when suspected murderer Lee Harvey Oswald, Gary Oldman, is murdered he is forced to stop his investigation and told that Oswald was definitely the lone shooter. He begins investigating again when he disagrees with the conclusions drawn in the Warren report and he believes that multiple shooters were involved in the assassination because he does not believe in the magic bullet theory. His investigation culminates in his attempt to prosecute New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw, Tommy Lee Jones, which ultimately fails because not enough evidence is presented.\n\nThe actors are asked to deliver very difficult dialogue here as they spew out boatloads of information and must speak in an urgent tone at all times. Fortunately they are up to the task as they weave all of this together and make a compelling argument, all the while they never leave us confused as we can logically follow their argument. Laurie Metcalf in particular shines as investigator Suzy Cox with her tenacity and sensible approach to her work serving as the ideal of the film. Even Kevin Costner, who can be a stolid leading man as seen in Dances with Wolves (1990), is a figure that we can admire as he appears to be the only person with the bravery to voice his moral outrage at the accepting of the faulty Warren report. The entire cast is stacked as you get Sissy Spacek, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Donald Sutherland in small roles doing some great work. \n\nThe editing of the film is masterful with Stone's penchant for using various different lenses and visual styles coming to the forefront as documentary footage, flashbacks and scenes set in real time all being woven together. The whole film moves at a very fast pace but even though we only really need the information we get in the first 2 and a half hours for the court case to be affecting it never feels like a boring exposition dump. Pietro Scalia and Joe Hutshing earned their Academy Award for Best Editing as they really had their work cut out for them and they managed to create an entertaining, informative film out of a very serious subject matter.\n\nAs someone who thinks that The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is highly overrated I find it offensive that Oliver Stone lost Best Director to Jonathan Demme. I appreciate Demme's work as a director of romantic comedies like Something Wild (1986) and Married to the Mob and I think that Rachel Getting Married (2008) was the best film of 2008 but The Silence of the Lambs is overwrought and not particularly shocking. Meanwhile Stone takes on an incredibly ambitious project and executes his vision well to produce an angry film filled with conviction that would have seemed like a simple piece of propaganda in the hands of most other directors.\n\nThis is a film that deserves to be seen even if the viewer is vehemently against the ideas that Stone puts forward because despite the fact that I didn't walk away believing Garrison I appreciated the man for his principles. It's also en ‘epic' that is remarkably easy to watch, unlike Lawrence of Arabia (1962) or Reds (1981), so put it on and see how engaging it is, get drawn deep into Garrison's belief and maybe even question some of your own.",

The two prime examples: when Kevin Costner presents his case to the jury at the end, and the second, when Donald Sutherland talks candidly to Costner in the park.  The first, okay, he's a lawyer, you can expect that.  But the second case?  Sutherland appears to be boasting about his acting chops for memorizing such an intricately detailed script, and comes off as incredibly phony.  The cast, again, incredible.  The story intriguing.  Even the flashbacks, with such vivid imagery, were amazing.  But again, I found myself watching it in chunks over several days, and I just can't rate it higher as a result.

That answer is presented to us in his 1991 film JFK. Kevin Costner does a damn good job of playing Jim Garrison, the detective who reopened the case a few years later. Stone and company provide a thoroughly compelling case, claiming that there were others involved other than Lee Harvey Oswald. Clocking in at over 3 hours, JFK is very long, and my patience oftentimes runs thin for investigative films/shows. Luckily, it pays off in the end with an incredible courtroom scene where Garrison presents his case to a jury. Stone has convinced me with relentless amounts of evidence that the legal declaration stating that Oswald acted alone in the killing of JFK had to be a farce, to some degree.",

I was thinking, \"Oh no! Do I have to listen to this for 3 hours?\" The answer was yes, but he quickly sold me. I think his acting got better as the film went on. That's one thing this film has, it's an amazing cast. Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones, Gay Oldman, John Candy, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, Wayne Knight, Sissy Spacek and so on. This film is extremely well acted. Now just because a film has good acting, doesn't mean that it will be entertaining. I will admit, this is a very long movie and it starts off pretty slow. As Kevin Costner's Jim Garrison begins the case on the assassination of JFK, his leads are pretty minimal. It doesn't seem like his case is building that much as most of the evidence is shrouded in secrecy. Luckily, the intrigue is so strong that you have to keep watching. Throughout the film, more and more clues start to come Jim Garrison's way and by the end of the film, it is just an amazing scene to see. In most films over three hours long, in my opinion, if it doesn't have a stellar climax, then I am very upset that I watched a film for three hours for an ending that wasn't satisfying. Oh my goodness, the climax of this movie is perfect! You really sit there in your seat thinking, \"This is outrageous! How can the FBI allow such a thing?!\" I don't think it is a spoiler to say the JFK was killed and there is a talk of a government conspiracy. Speaking of which, I gave this film a perfect score because I love films about United States politicians and love conspiracy theories. I believe that you need to be a bit of both to get the best out of this movie. If you are a person who couldn't care less about United States politics and think all conspiracy theorists are nutjobs, then yeah I'd say that this film would be too complex or uninteresting for you. If you do care about those, this is a perfect movie! An absolute must watch!",

            "content": "I remember liking JFK more than I did this time around. It's still a good movie and it has some brilliant actors (actually it feels like 50% of the actors in Hollywood show up in this film,) but there is something sadly missing. The story tells about the only legal case ever brought to trial in relation to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. I think a more emotionally effective film would have spent more time on Jim Garrison, and his struggle to get this day in court. They try in a few brief scenes to point out the difficult family situation Garrison is experiencing, but the movie never came across as being about him. Instead it was all about the case. There is some fascinating stuff in this film, but it feels so scattershot that I sometimes grew confused over how it would tie together. The movie is long and it all seems to be pointing towards that final scene where Garrison gets his day in court and can present his big closing argument.\n\nWhile watching this big climax suddenly it hit me. This isn't a film about Jim Garrison and his passion to get the truth out there, this is a film about Oliver Stone's passion to get the truth out there! It's a 3-hour-long \"closing argument\" that spells out for the audience all that has been found in the many studies of JFK's assassination. Stone even conveniently connect the dots for us, making the assumptions so we don't have to ourselves. There's nothing wrong with this film, and certainly if even half of the things presented as facts in the movie are accurate then it's worth getting the truth out there to general audiences. I applaud the idea, but didn't adore the execution. In many ways it felt like the movie was just throwing as many pieces of damning evidence they could find in an effort to make a point. Sadly the point they make is \"We don't have any idea what happened, but it wasn't what the Warren Commission said.\" I think this movie could inspire someone to look deeper into the truth of things, and to question what we are told, but I don't know how well it holds up as a cohesive story.",

JFK is one of the best pieces of filmmaking i've ever seen, and one of my all-time favorite films.\n\nWith films like this, where the subject matter is delicate and lies close to people's heart, and where it is incredibly controversial there will always be haters of the movie just because they hate it (I've read many reviews like that) without even viewing the film properly, without predjudice or anything like that.\nI am no american, and i am too young to have been alive around 1963, so i knew little about the assassination going into this film, except ofcourse that JFK was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald (which is something i learned in school, i didnt know if it was true or not, i did know that there was some controvery around the assassination though, and that's it) So i went in watching without predjudice. A movie like this will always have historians or other people complaining about how factually inaccurate it is, and frankly, i dont care about this in any way, same with biographies, i dont care if it is incredibly inaccurate, i care if it is a well-made film, and damn, JFK is one hell of a well made film. It's one of the most riveting, educational, thrilling, mysterious, and controversial films of all time. In my honest opinion there really is little to complain here.\n\nThe main thing about this film is exposition and there's a lot of it in the film. There are times when Stone essentially asks us to listen while a character explains things. These scenes could have been deadly. He makes them exciting by using persuasive actors, by cutting between many different points of view, and by reconstructing the events being described. Stone's film is hypnotically watchable. Leaving aside all of its drama and emotion, it is a masterpiece of film assembly. The writing, the editing, the music, the photography, are all used here in a film of enormous complexity, to weave a persuasive tapestry out of an overwhelming mountain of evidence and testimony. Film students will examine this film in wonder in the years to come, astonished at how much information it contains, how many characters, how many interlocking flashbacks, what skillful interweaving of documentary and fictional footage. The film hurtles for 188 minutes through a sea of information and conjecture, and never falters and never confuses us. That is not to say that we are quite sure, when it is over and we try to reconstruct the experience in our minds, exactly what Stone's conclusions are. \"JFK\" does not unmask the secrets of the Kennedy assassination. Instead, it uses the Garrison character as a seeker for truth who finds that the murder could not have happened according to the official version. \n\nJFK is one of the best edited films of all time.",

And yes, you have to take the \"facts\" presented with a grain of salt, but at the same time maintain a good balance, because Stone does provide info that at the time may have been controversial, but which we now know to be very close to the truth.\nThis is definitely a film that will leave you thinking and debating for some time afterwards.",

Kevin Costner did a wonderful job portraying Jim Garrison, it was very apparent to me that he cared about the part he was playing. Other actors in the film were all the same way, very professional about their parts and they did a great job being realistic. While the entire movie is about a theory that has never been proven true, it does a great job explaining why Stone thought that there was a conspiracy to kill John Kennedy. It can also be very persuasive. If you think that the movie is fact, it can make you hate the government because you think they killed Kennedy.\n\tWhile I am a fan of the movie, I think the movie could be much better if it were shorter. Some things are impossible to make shorter, and I understand that, but three and a half hours felt like an eternity while watching it. Some parts of were interesting and kept you entertained, while others confused you and made you wonder how it had anything to do with the plot of the film at all. If this film were greatly reduced in length, down to two hours or somewhere thereabout, I would have enjoyed the movie much more. It is also quite obvious throughout the length of the film it is an old movie, it is low resolution and there are even spots in black and white. I wouldn't mind if this were updated and made HD. I am a fan of the conspiracy topic, but the movie was not the best way to show what might have happened in Kennedy's final days. That is why I gave it a 4/5. If the film were a little more concise, it would likely be much closer to a 5/5.",

Also when Clay Shaw was on the stand and lied that wasn't right because he told police that he went by the name Clay Bertrand and all of this other stuff that he told the police but he lied on the stand in front of all those people. I also liked how it showed when Oswald was in the book depository I liked how it showed like a recap of it and showed how it went down kind of and I also liked how it would show how Jack Ruby shot Oswald and how he did it like how he got into the place like one of his friends let him in.

The vast supporting cast are consistently great, even Sissy Spacek who is saddled with the worst character in the film.  Her \"unsupportive spouse\" is a tiresome stereotype that just manages to come off as selfish and more than a little dumb.  While Michael Rooker's skeptic sometimes is the sanest chracter in the film, she's shrill and annoying.  Where the film fails is in painting a coherent picture of the assassination.  What it has to work with is a lot of unanswered questions, but it persists in supplying answers even when it has no evidence to support them.  Characters repeatedly offer \"it could have happened this way\" speculations, and then immediately act as if a fact has been established when really, a speculation was thrown out.  If it did this a few times it wouldn't hurt the film, but about 75% of the conclusions drawn are of this nature.  At 3 1/2 hours, it's a long slog, and one that could have been relieved a bit by having fewer very very long speculative monologues.",

Stone opened a massive can of worms by effectively proving that nothing was what it seemed when Kennedy was assassinated, and it makes for a gripping political thriller. When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22nd 1963, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) learns about the links the assassination had to New Orleans, and that the accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) had several co-conspirators, including pilot David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), male prostitute Willie O'Keefe (Kevin Bacon) and, most crucially the flamboyant Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones). But, as Garrison delves deeper into this case, he discovers a web of political lies and skulduggery, cover-ups and corruption, and he learns a lot of shocking home truths from the mysterious X (Donald Sutherland). It's a film which got America and the rest of the world talking again. Stone weaves a compelling and shocking history lesson as a suspenseful thriller, and his arguments are shocking and believable. Plus, he gets a brilliant performance out of Costner, whose Garrison will not stop fighting and looking for the truth.",

I've read both Jim Garrison's 'On The Trail Of The Assassins' and Jim Marrs' 'Crossfire The Plot That Killed Kennedy', the books Oliver Stone's JFK is based as well as many other books and articles on the last President assassinated. I have come to the conclusion that there was more to his murder than Lee Harvey Oswald getting off three remarkable shots within 6 seconds. Without getting too deep into my theory, I 100% believe the mob was involved and 100% believe Lyndon Johnson was not. Maybe smaller levels of government were involved but not the reaches Oliver Stone and Jim Garrison believed. Biggest proof mob was involved: 1) helped with unions to get Kennedy elected. 2) The Kennedy's went after mob once they were in office. Especially Bobby. 3) Patsy(Oswald) was killed by a low level mob enforcer, Jack Ruby. 4) Bobby was killed 5 years later. Now to the movie. At a brisk 191min(Director's Cut), JFK is an exciting, thought provoking and well acted piece of celluloid. This is one of the movies that inspired 6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon because anyone who was anyone in 1991 was in this movie. Sissy Spacek and Michael Rooker are standouts among a standout ensemble, but this Kevin Costner's movie and he kills it. The final courtroom scene is one of the finest of its kind to date.

It leaves us with questions unanswered, just like today, and we still wonder and hope that we'll get much needed answers one day.  Oliver Stone is able to capture each scene with finesse, while being aided by cinematographer Robert Richardson, who perfectly captures each scene that helps with the tone and mood of every scene.  Composer John Williams does a great job at composing the score, which helps with the mood of each scene (tense, heartfelt, and shocking).  Stone and Sklar craft a script that makes the right transitions while staying even, as well as remain engaging and thrilling throughout the lengthy run time of three hours, nine minutes (three hours, twenty-six minutes with the Director's Cut).  The film is also aided by terrific performances, brought to life by the likes of Kevin Costner, Kevin Bacon, Martin Sheen, Laurie Metcalf, and the best one if all, Tommy Lee Jones.  A must-see, and the perfect cinematic representation of JFK's assassination.",

            "content": "With the 50th anniversary of the assassination of President Kennedy this week, the media is awash with the memory of Kennedy. In addition we are being plied with new films such as Killing Kennedy and Parkland. It is a good time to enjoy the masterpiece that is Oliver Stone's JFK.\n\nFew films create the amount of discussion that can emerge after a viewing of JFK. As arousing as the material may be, it should not distract us from some superb performances from the cast and an iconic achievement from the director. To paraphrase a number of critics; as history it may be controversial, dubious, biased and bunk but as film-making it is riveting, electric and a masterpiece.\n\nJFK sports a supreme cast\n\nHeaded by Kevin Costner, the cast includes Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, John Candy, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and other familiar faces.\n\nCostner, though, is the main role. Following the flawed but immensely popular Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and his double Academy Award win for Dances With Wolves and preceding his role in The Bodyguard, Costner was in the peak of his career. He was not the only one as we shall see. But did he make the most of a substantial role in this film?\n\nOn one hand it is a little harsh to be too critical. In many a mystery, conspiracy, or crime film the main investigator is not necessarily made into a compelling character. Instead it is the story or the suspects who lead the intrigue. In literature and television, where the investigator character has the opportunity to return, there is more scope to make it an interesting character. This can follow the character into a film adaptation but is otherwise not essential.\n\nThe fact that Costner has little in common with the real life Jim Garrison - an imposing 6'7\" attorney with a deep voice - may suggest other considerations, like looks and name, took precedence. (Cheekily, Jim Garrison does have a role in the film - as Earl Warren, the Chief Justice whose report Garrison sought to undermine)\n\nThat being said, the script provided ample opportunity for Costner to produce something special. Two opportunities in particular - the domestic scenes with Garrison's wife, Liz [Sissy Spacek]; and the final courtroom scene which ends with almost a Mr Smith Goes to Washington passion. Overall, Costner is fair but not great. That being said, I certainly prefer Costner for this role over Harrison Ford and Mel Gibson, who were favoured by the producers\n\nJFK, though, is more about the superb supporting cast than the lead\n\nJack Lemmon has only a small role, but in a matter of minutes he shows us the ability that saw him win two acting Oscars. When we think of John Candy in a serious role most immediately think of Cool Runnings, but in this film, despite a small one, he shows how much more range he has. So nervous was he, to be in a serious role surrounded by so many big names, that he is perspiring heavily in all his scenes. For many, JFK was the first introduction to Gary Oldman who brings to life a portrayal of Lee Harvey Oswald who, in this story, is necessarily contradictory and requires a powerful performance delivered in small increments.\n\nThere are three supporting performances in particular that stand out in this film. The first is Joe Pesci, also in career-prime form, who came into JFK on the back of Home Alone and an Oscar win for Goodfellas and would follow JFK with My Cousin Vinny and Casino. Pesci is superb as the paranoid, anxious, panicky, violently anti-communist and somewhat loony David Ferrie.\n\nDonald Sutherland delivers an exciting portrayal of the enigmatic X in one of the film's most iconic and memorable scenes. It went a long way to establish Sutherland's ability to play the authoritarian. His future roles, whether in Commander in Chief or The Hunger Games, owe a fair bit to his performance in JFK. Even his voice carries that potential as we saw in Lord of War.\n\nMost impressive though is Tommy Lee Jones. Coming a couple of years before the role that would establish his name - for the wider audience anyway - in The Fugitive, this is not the Tommy Lee Jones you may think you know. Here he plays Clay Shaw; a Louisiana businessman and something of a Southern dandy. The scenes of Shaw's private party, where Jones is covered in gold paint and humiliated, reminds one of the risks and experiments actors are willing to do in their early career. Jones' Oscar nomination for the role shows it's benefits.\n\nThe real star of this film is Oliver Stone\n\nWith many films the key task of the director is to not get in the way of the plot or the characters, but to give them room to produce their magic themselves. A good director is often considered to be a light, invisible factor with little to say. A great director is often considered one who gently enhances the story and performances - providing emphasis or subtlety as the situation demands. It is a job that is easy to screw up, less easy to do well, but dangerously tempting to overstep and do too much. JFK is a standout as a film where the director has a strong presence; as some omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent manipulative deity; yet this influence does not overburden and screw up the film, instead it enhances it significantly.\n\nJFK has a special place in my film memory. As a young fan it was the first real taste of what a director has the power to do, if - and it is a big if - he can pull it off. JFK is special because the absurd level of manipulation and ambition in vision does come off.\n\nThe film is full of examples of Stone manipulating the audience, but three scenes standout. The first is the iconic \"We're through the looking-glass here people\" scene, where Garrison and his entourage from his DA's office discuss the history of Oswald over cocktails at a Louisiana restaurant. The second is of Garrison meeting X who fills him in on the big picture of the activities of US military intelligence, the influence of the military-industrial complex, angry sacred cows within the Pentagon and the shift in policy for war in Vietnam. The third is of Garrison at court attempting to debunk the magic bullet theory and sharing his own vision of the assassination.\n\nEach of these scenes are heavy in dialogue, bombarding the viewer with information. But they are well paced, using quick silent shots and scenery to break it up. Music, provided by Hollywood legend John Williams, is used variously to quicken or slow the heart rate or create mood. Sometimes sombre and haunting, sometimes pacey and suspecting. Each of these scenes combine shots of the conversation of the moment with archival footage - both historical and re-imagined, using actors of the film - shifting from colour to black-and-white.\n\nIn addition, there are insertions of images covering a plotline not currently being discussed. For example, the looking-glass scene is broken up with images of someone producing a doctored photo of Oswald. These insertions, sometimes subtle, sometimes overt; are effective in create inferences and subliminal messages in the mind of the audience. Thus, both conscious and subconscious of the audience is infiltrated, rightfully earning Stone his place as a master propagandist.\n\nEach of these scenes rank highly in my list of favourites, they join scenes from The Silence of the Lambs, The Shawshank Redemption and a few others as those I most enjoy replaying in my mind.\n\nJFK represents such an achievement in direction that it could possibly never be repeated. Its technique is so effectual that when viewing other films with a tense, conspiratorial or mysterious story - such as Zodiac or Zero Dark Thirty - it is tempting to think they could benefit from more of a JFK treatment. But the technique is so synonymous with JFK, parodied everywhere from Seinfeld to The Simpsons, it would be abundantly clear that that was what you were trying to do.\n\nThere was a time when I called Stone my favourite director with some confidence. This was mostly due to my regard for this film and also for Platoon (I was probably too young to appreciate Wall Street and Born on the Fourth of July at the time). I also gave him dues for two films that were not well appreciated but I still had time for - Natural Born Killers and Any Given Sunday.\n\nBut as the years went by it was harder and harder to call Stone my favourite with conviction. Not only had many other contenders risen (or at least continued to produce good work) but Stone was clearly deteriorating. The failure of Alexander on many levels was probably the final nail in the coffin. In retrospect, JFK probably represents the peak of the three-time Oscar winner's career.\n\nJFK was well represented at the 64th Academy Awards with nine nominations\n\nIt only came away with two - for editing and cinematography - as these awards were a very tough contest. As well as JFK, other top contenders included The Silence of the Lambs, Bugsy, Beauty and the Beast, Terminator 2 and Thelma and Louise. It is nice to remember these awards are occasionally a difficult choice between excellent candidates. The Silence of the Lambs took out the big 5 - screenplay, actor, actress, director and picture. In the face of such strong competition you can't complain too much and just being nominated is considerable recognition - something that certainly can't be said every year.\n\nAs much as I love this film, in most cases I find I have to side with the Academy in their choices. Best Picture, for instance, rightfully belonged to The Silence of the Lambs. John Williams missed out on best score for JFK to Alan Menken for Beauty and the Beast. Mind you he has missed out many times for excellent work. Tommy Lee Jones could probably feel unlucky to miss out on the supporting actor award to Jack Palance - for playing Curly in the fun, but never revisited, City Slickers. Best Director is tough, but I have to say I would have given it to Stone rather than Demme again for The Silence of the Lambs, by a small margin.\n\nDespite the controversy of its material and the decline of its director, JFK remains a modern masterpiece, represents peak performances from a number of participants and deserves to be held up as the best example of the power of the director's craft.\n\nhttp://rants-n-raves.com/2013/11/22/film-review-jfk/",

Stone seems to be saying that History, like Art, is open to interpretation. A lot of interpretation. There's some great scenes in this movie like Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison, the dogged prosecutor determined to find out what really happened at Dealey Plaza, pointing out all the military and intelligence offices in downtown New Orleans right across the street from each other in a paranoid frenzy. Or Donald Sutherland (\"Call me X\") laying out a ton of suspicious information in a few short minutes. John Williams' score which has elements of Coplandesque patriotism along with discordant, frenzied themes deserves a lot of credit for helping to create an atmosphere that resembles a High School Civics class combined with a tense thriller.

            "content": "\"Who killed the president?\"\r\n\r\nAround the time I watched JFK, I was reading this novel by Stephen King called \"11/22/63\". The title of this book was also the date of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Like this film, 11/22/63 was about the assassination, yet it also has its own set of characters. But the film and the book are very different. While JFK is about the true story of Kevin Costner's character and his colleagues trying to go in deeper into the Kennedy assassination and why it happened, 11/22/63 was a science fiction book. It was all about a teacher who is friends with a guy who owns a diner. One day, the guy calls the teacher to his diner, and the teacher finds out that the guy has a time machine in his diner. The guy is obsessed with finding out who killed John F. Kennedy and wants to stop whoever did it (because as it was illustrated in JFK, there was a sort of chain of horrible events after Kennedy's assassination, such as the Vietnam War, and the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy). He tells the teacher to go back in time in order to stop Lee Harvey Oswald. So the book and the film are very different. But if I were pressed, the film made a much larger impact on me. On paper, the book should've made the bigger impact. It had a thrilling story, it was over 800 pages long, and featured a closer look at what really happened on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas. In fact, when I read that book, it held information I didn't know about Oswald such as him having a wife and brother. That was probably the most I ever knew about the events and people surrounding the assassination. But as informative and thrilling this Stephen King novel really was, it ain't got nothing on JFK. \r\n\r\nI'm no stranger to the conspiracies and controversies surrounding the assassination. As a matter of fact, I am one of those people who are very interested with urban legends and conspiracies. I'm just very curious about the uncertainty of it all. So as one would point out, I should've been very interested in this movie since it is a conspiracy movie. Be that as it may, I initially thought JFK would be one of those long, drawn-out history films, retelling stuff that obviously already happened. Pretend you're in school, and the lesson that day was JFK's assassination. Your class is noisy, and your teacher becomes so irritated, she threatens to make the class stay in the room during recess. That doesn't stop your class, so your punishment is to sit down in your chair, and read your history book and learn all about the assassination until recess is over and you can go to your next period. That's what I though JFK would be, despite the fact I've seen its 84% rating on its RT page. \"Going to your next period\" was a metaphor for when the movie ends and you can stop being bored learning stuff that already happened. But this movie was truly incredible. It was bashed by some critics for not being truthful in some points, but in my opinion, JFK made history interesting. It told me about points and people who were part of the pre-assassination, post-assassination, and during the assassination. It introduced a cast of characters I never knew were part of anything like George De Mohrenschildt, Bill and Janet Williams, Jim Garrison, Clay Shaw/Clay Bertrand, David Ferrie, Oswald's wife Marina, Earl Warren, Guy Banister, and the mysterious Black Ops Agent called \"X\". All the performances were great, especially by Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Donald Sutherland, Joe Pesci, and even Kevin Bacon. When Jim Garrison's team are together and one of them are telling everyone else about something find out, even if what they're are just facts, they were interesting and I just wanted to keep watching. The assassination already happened over 45 years ago, but it's just as every bit as interesting and thrilling as any movie you can buy at your local store. \"It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma!\", said by Joe Pesci's character David Ferrie pretty much summed up everything I thought about the film. Everything was so complicated, yet several people, most especially this one determined district attorney, was so focused on finding what they would give their lives for: the truth. They'd be disillusioned with anything less than the truth. It was already difficult to find the truth, yet there was even people who didn't want them to find it out. People who would also give their lives just so the truth would not be found out. Because of that, not only was each fact they revealed to each other over dinner interesting, it also made me excited because each fact was one step closer to what I also wanted to know: the truth. When a movie about a guy wanting to know a truth is so good that it makes the viewer want to know the truth too, you know that film is special. These people take the viewer with them on a journey to the truth and it was thrilling every single step of the way. \r\n\r\nWhat I disliked about the film was what kept from giving this movie a complete 5 out of 5. When I first watched this movie, it was engaging and kept me completely immersed in the film. I did not want to stop watching, I did not go to the bathroom, I did not check the clock to see what time it was. I was focused. But I decided later on to rewatch the film in order to see if it was still cool. And it wasn't as cool. While the film was still really well-acted and crafted, when the team of Kevin Costner tell their facts over the table, I realized, it wasn't as riveting as the first viewing because I already knew those facts. After the first viewing of JFK, I realized that this film was different from other true story films I've seen because I didn't know about Jim Garrison's investigation and his case against Clay Shaw. There were other political true story films like Recount (starring Kevin Spacey and Denis Leary) and Game Change (starring Julianne Moore and Ed Harris). Recount and Game Change are about the political campaigns of Al Gore against George W. Bush and of John McCain against Barack Obama. Though Recount was only about the campaign team of Al Gore, Game Change was actually about Sarah Palin's involvement with John McCain's campaign (with Julianne Moore as Palin and Ed Harris as John McCain). Now, I know both of those films weren't like JFK or Argo, both of which relied on thrilling the audience. Recount and Game Change was about retelling the personal behind-the-scenes events that happened to those involved with the campaigns and elections of Gore and McCain. But nonetheless, I already knew who won the election, so no matter how the film tries build up that its main characters are working so hard so they'll win, it's sad to watch them doing it, 'cause you know they still lose. But for JFK, I didn't know anything. I didn't know about the different facts the team was talking about. I knew of the conspiracies, but I didn't know them like the back of my hand. When this movie revealed it to me, it was awesome. This film made all the dumb action and cheesy humor in Michael Bay's films look worse than they already are because you need a little more than looking at the picture to understand what's happening. This movie, like Pulp Fiction, was carried by the dialogue. It asks more from the viewer. It exercises your brain. And like Inception, because of that, this movie is so great in many ways. But when your watching it for a second time, you already know what happens and you already know how the ending's gonna turn out. As Roger Ebert once said, \"Every great film should seem new every time you see it.\" That's what I feel about a lotta movies. But for this one? Not so much. Also, as interesting the ideas and theories of Mr. Garrison were, they were very outrageous. Because of this film, I can believe that Clay Shaw was Clay Bertrand therefore was an accomplice in a wide conspiracy to assassinate Jack Kennedy. Because of this film, I can believe that Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't alone on that fateful day on November 22, 1963. Because of this film, I can even believe that the Warren Commission was mostly a work of fiction, and was just released to satisfy the American public. But to believe that Lyndon B. Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover were part of everything and Kennedy's assassination was coup d'état? I know the film isn't exactly asking me to believe Jim Garrison. But I admit it. If I was alive in 1966-1969 when his investigation was on the news, I would think he was just a crazy guy with crazy anti-government theories even without the media displaying him as such.  \r\n\r\nWhen something big happens, like an assassination, the loss of a candidate at an election, or a financial crash, the public only see them with the naked eye. The media is what helps them comprehend and see these crises. Though it is kind of a fact that the media sometimes exaggerates things and as illustrated in JFK, they display rumors to destroy a reputation if it seems fit. The media has always done that, and they always will because there is no one there to stop them. Even if there is, I doubt it'll stop them. So there is no absolute way the public can know the real and definite truth behind these big events. There are even people other than the media, maybe politicians or even police authority, that don't want the truth to get out. Even for this film. Maybe Oliver Stone tweaked some important points, I don't know. I've never thought of that before, and when I watched this film, it brought out that thought, so I'll give this film that. It's four years until all the information about the assassination that was not discussed with the American public is released. Nobody knows anything until then. But until then we'll just have to make do with this movie. Anyway, JFK, with its fantastic dialogue and speeches, great performances, and its unique style, JFK is a spectacular and truly unforgettable film. Though it might not warrant repeated viewings, one cannot forget the impact and thrill caused by the thought-provoking first viewing of the closest look into one of the greatest and controversial mysteries ever to exist within American history.",

Also, the story about the main character Jim Garrison's family issues is completely redundant, because the assassination of Kennedy and the people and events related to it is the main topic of the film, and because the subject and the story is (or should be) far more interesting than the characters. Kevin Costner as Garrison is passable, and Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon and Donald Sutherland are all great in their roles.

Stone is honest about this in his descriptions  of the film, noting them as a counter-myth to those put forward by  by the Warren Commission. However, I can't help but feel that most people who have seen this movie will come away with a distorted view of events. The movie has one of the most superb casts of any movie that I can think of, except of course that there are no women in this movie apart from the doting housewife. In spite of that, every movie buff will adore the parade of familiar faces, from Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, to Donald Sutherland and John Candy, to Gary Oldman and Joe Pesci. Also, the perverted homosexual love seen with Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci and Kevin Bacon dressed as 18th century pompadours  is one you will probably never forget. This movie also makes you forget things like Waterworld and the Postman, and remember that Kevin Costner is actually a talented actor.",

            "content": "Director Oliver Stone is no stranger to biopics or documentaries covering the lives of influential or powerful people. He has looked in the lives of Vietnam veteran and political activist Ron Kovic in \"Born On The Fourth Of July\"; Jim Morrison, the lead singer of \"The Doors\"; military general and conquerer \"Alexander\" the great; Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro in \"Comandante\" and two films on the exploits of American presidents Richard \"Nixon\" and George \"W.\" Bush. In the films mentioned, Stone explores the lives of these men but in \"JFK\" he does the opposite and explores the death of the man and in the process, crafts one of his most accomplished films.\n In Dallas, Texas on November 22nd 1963, President John F. Kennedy is assassinated. The official explanation released by the F.B.I. doesn't make sense and is very suspicious. As a result, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) decides to investigate and uncovers a dangerous conspiracy that may involve more than he could ever have imagined.\n Oliver Stone has done his homework here and bombards the audience with facts, theories and reports from the media, interviews and eyewitness testimonies. He covers the history of events right across the board from the Bay of Pigs to the Warren Report via the questionable marksmanship of \"lone gunman\" Lee Harvey Oswald. Whether or not you agree with Stone's theories is of little importance. What is of great importance is his ability to pose serious questions on one of the most tragic political events and biggest conspiracies in American history. It could easily come across that Stone (or Garrison) have all the answers but they don't. This is a film that endeavours to get to the root of the truth. Many questions will remain unanswered but it's also not the type of film that claims to provide them. Some information is pure speculation but the very place where Stone succeeds is his ability to instil debate. He welcomes it and the film is far more powerful because of it. It's a tangled web that has been weaved and Stone deserves the utmost respect in tackling it head on. What's most impressive though is that it's never boring. With all the details, it could be in danger of losing the audiences attention but it doesn't and this is thanks-in-large to editor's Pietro Scalia and Joe Hutshing in skilfully piecing all the fragmented narrative strands together. They won an Oscar for their work and deservingly so. Another deserving Oscar winner was cinematographer Robert Richardson for his marvellous attention to detail  in capturing the look and feel of the 1960's. Amongst the the brisk pace and attention to detail is an abundant cast of quality actors and no matter how small the role, each of them get a chance to shine; Gary Oldman makes a perfect Oswald and other notable displays from Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Donald Sutherland and an Oscar nominated turn from Tommy Lee Jones as eccentric socialite, Clay Shaw. It's Costner who is the main focus here though and he delivers a solid and determined performance. More importantly, he's an appealing presence which is very much required when the film steps over the 3 hour mark. He captures the obsession of Garrison and in a lot of ways makes it our own; his dogged determination for answers reflecting ours. When all the dust has settled, the film culminates into a conventional court room drama but still remains riveting. It's during this time that despite some shocking revelations earlier in the film that Stone finishes with aplomb and takes his chance to disclose some staggering pieces of information.\n A conspiracy theorists dream, that may take some criticism for being hypothetical or one-sided but there's no denying Stone's bravery or his skill in encapsulating the paranoia and unrest at this time in history.",

While it's obviously not completely embedded in historical fact, taking many liberties and drawing on a lot of assumptions, it effectively raises questions as to what really happened on that tragic day.  Top notch performances by an ensemble cast keep the film exciting through every twist and turn.  I was especially intrigued by Donald Sutherland's brief performance as Mr. X.  The political intrigue moves at a blistering pace and each new development is fascinating.  Normally, I would consider the heavy use of the footage of JFK being shot to be in bad taste, but it's necessary to the structure of the film, and helps drive home the message that is being presented.  Regardless of how much of this story has been fictionalized, there is more truth out there than the majority of the American people realize, and Oliver Stone does a good job of making that point.",

It is a masterpiece of artistry by Oliver Stone presenting the overwhelming complexities and theories pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, in 1963. This is not a film about the facts of the assassination, but about the suspicion and the \"not-knowing.\" \"JFK\" accurately reflects our national state of mind since Nov. 22, 1963. We feel the whole truth has not been told, that more than one shooter was involved, that somehow maybe the CIA, the FBI, Castro, the Mafia or the Russians, or all of the above, were involved. We don't know how. Stone's unrestrained energy and limitless technical skills assembles a perplexing array of \"facts,\" presenting the film leaving the viewer fully immersed as the conspiracy theory unfolds.\r\n\r\nNew Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) takes it upon himself to re-open the case years after the assassination, not satisfied with the extremely suspicious story presented by the FBI. Kevin Costner, in the central role, plays the role brilliantly with determination as the character of James Garrison, who begins to assemble a mountain of evidence, footage, characters, testimony, theories, and motives. The film weaves through a sea of information, conjecture, documentaries, and fictional footage for 188 minutes, and never falters and never confuses us. Individual pieces of information alone doesn't amount to much of anything, but when it is all the piece's are assembled with incredible skill, it all falls into place, and the result is extraordinary. A film with a smooth and consistent visual style would have felt false. Stone and his expert cinematographer, Robert Richardson (who won the Oscar), work in every relevant visual medium: 35mm, 16mm, Super 8, 8mm, video, still photos, color, black and white. His editors, Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia, also Oscar winners, assemble this material like the pieces of a jigsaw. It's not linear; there's a sense of parallel events moving forward on more than one front at a time. \r\n\r\nOne of the most satisfying conspiracy theory movies ever, and Oliver Stone's finest work to date. Stone utilizes his incredible cast of characters extremely well. Riveting, engaging, and fascinating from start to finish, despite its historical inaccuracies and conjuncture. Despite its length-a bit over three hours, the film's prolific cast, coupled with its fascinating insights and theories, leaves the viewer completely invested throughout. The film effectively captures and reproduces the overwhelming emotions of a country during a very dark moment in American history.",

I have never been concerned with what views a film may try to assert, I am far more interested in how the director does it. Of course, the ability to evoke tremendous feelings is a necessity, which the film does. Hands down, Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" is one of the well-constructed films you'll ever see. Aside for its marvelous technical mastery, it has one of best supporting casts with excellent performances from the likes of Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, and Tommy Lee Jones. I have seen Kevin Costner in Brian De Palma's \"The Untouchables,\" a film that I dislike, more importantly it had a sub-par performance from Costner. But, in \"JFK,\" Costner erases any ill I had for him with such a composed performance and by delivering one of the greatest monologues in film! Not to mention the several other minor characters in this film who have their own charm. \"JFK\" is a great film, and probably the best film I've seen since I saw \"Fellini Satyricon\" last, which was over a month ago.",

Oliver Stone has brought a truly controversial issue into perspective and shown the world details behind the killing.  The cast was some incredible A-listers at the time such as Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek, John Candy, and Kevin Bacon who all plays great and memorable performances.  I was surprised Costner didn't get more praise for this film, I thought his performance was incredible.  Tommy Lee Jones was incredible in the film and deserved his Oscar nom, and I also really enjoyed Joe Pesci who was great as usual.  This film does everything right, and what I adored the most was the complexity and how we have to put the puzzle together and challenge ourselves.

            "content": "I think that it would be pretty awesome to have Oliver Stone as a history teacher for the three days he would have with the job before they fired him. Heck, I don't even know if he would make it three \"periods\" into his \"first\" day, and it wouldn't simply be his crazy, controversal views on politics and history that would land the nail in his teaching career coffin, it would be him being caught with whatever kind of insane drugs that he takes for an early morning snack, which I guess would go hand-in-hand with his dubious history lessons, because you would have to be on drugs to think up history this crazy. No, his history isn't even mildly that farfetched; in fact, it's riveting, especially now-a-days, when you can look back and have your mind blown by the fascinating fact that in his youth, Gary Oldman looked an awful lot like Sam Rockwell. Seriously, someone has got to make a movie with Christoph Waltz as Ryan Gosling's dad and Gary Oldman as Sam Rockwell's. Granted, Gary Oldman would have had to have been 10 when he had little baby Rockwell, but hey, he was probably one smooth toddler, so who's to say he didn't attract his teacher's attention? Wow, that statement was so creepy, trippy and deeply offensive that Oliver Stone's probably going to make a movie out of it at some point, because you know that it's pretty much that guy's job to make people mad. Clearly, he's not doing his job well, because everyone's digging on this film, and while I'm not particularly animalistic about it, I'm enjoying myself too. However, it should go without saying - partially because I do the segway to death - that there aren't still bumps in that enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe film's ability to go so long at a steady pace with dialogue and rarely fall into dullness is impressive, though not surprising, considering that this is Olver Stone and that he is very well known for his ability to pump plenty of intrigue and style into his work. However, there are points in this film where the stylizing gets a touch overwhelming and rather gratuitous, certainly not to the extent of \"Natural Born Killers\" - where he just killed the filter and let lord knows what dump out -, but you will still find yourself saying, \"Okay, maybe that was a little much\" at points. Still, overstylizing is the least of the film's problem, because even though this film is able to dance outside of dullness, when you're looking at over 3 hours - or almost three-and-a-half hours in the case of the director's cut - consisting almost entirely of dialogue and investigation, things are gonna start losing steam, if not look a little too familiar. The film gets pretty darn repetitive pretty darn fast, and sure, the film breaks out of the loop quite often, but those moments are still gotten to eventually, with the preceding time being occupied with exposition, followed by exposition, then exposition and yet more exposition, and after a while intrigue's going to dip a bit. Many will walk into this film expecting fact-after-after-fact-after-fact, but it's hard to be prepared for just how unrelenting this film is in its barrage of exposition and discussion, something that is never - not even for a second - tedious, but with this film running such a mammoth length, disengagement is to be expected. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to tell you that those expectations go unfulfilled and that this film is never disengaging. Intrigue dilutes a little bit after a while, but never fades, keeping at a constant flow that makes the film consistently fascinating and, well, rather entertaining, and has to thank the top-notch filmmaking team behind it for that.\r\n\r\nRobert Richardson is one of the greatest cinematographers alive and few people aim to prove it more than Richardson's long-time collaborater, Mr. Oliver Stone, who makes many demands for lively, lush and versatile shots with lighting that can switch from bright to bleak in the blink of an eye and not feel offputting, and sure enough, you get that here and it all comes out brilliantly thanks to Richardson's masterful eye for photography. Of course, providing Richardson with great material for photography isn't the only thing that Oliver Stone does to keep the film engaging, because Mr. Stone is really bringing both in the directing seat and on paper. Oliver Stone's and Zachary Sklar's script stands to be tighter and more dynamic, but is still pretty sharp, keeping the long sequences of exposition going with not only snappy dialogue, but an endless barrage of consistently riveting and deeply fascinating facts married with probable fiction. Now, I and countless other think - nay - know that the made-up theories behind this film are quite frankly bogus, and the film seems to think that too, as it lacks the pretense of trying to really force its crackpot theories on you, but is still assigned the mission of providing complex and compelling possibilities that organically intertwine with incontrovertible facts, and it's a mission that is accomplished gracefully with the help of Oliver Stone, as well as his star-studded cast of true acting talents. With intrigue in each person's presence and emotion backing up their tension, every last member of this big name cast sells that they are all components of complexity, as well as humans, with each person - whether they be primaries, secondaries, tertiaries or even cameos - establishing the feeling of depth and tension as everything unfolds in both the case and them as humans. I for one couldn't be more impressed with Kevin Costner, who's always been a hit-or-miss actor, but one to really deliver when he hits, and boy is this a hit, because outside of charm and a great southern accent (Certainly better than his English accent), Costner is providing a sublte, yet powerful force of obsession and some degree of fear as Jim Garrison cuts deeper and deeper into the horrors of conspiracy and makes many shocking discoveries that could not only affect the nation, but his own life, and Costner's ability to convey all of that with such grace is all too refreshing. Now, in all honesty, the film is not as good as I'm making it sound, but there is still plenty of top-notch stuff pumped into this film, and maybe there's not enough of that top-notch stuff to make the film itself, as a whole, top-notch, but there's still plenty that's genuinely riveting about this film.\r\n\r\nWhen it's all said and, well, said - seeing as nothing's getting done other than talking -, the film is really pulled down and diluted by its countless loose, repetative sequences that lose steam after a while, yet never to the point where the film is left completely devoid of intrigue, because although the film stands to be tighter, it boasts dazzling visuals to engage your eyes and snappy, complex writing to engage your mind as fact and fiction find themselves seamlessly fused - with the help of Oliver Stone and his razor-sharp cast - to make \"JFK\" a consistently enjoyable and thoroughly fascinating study on the truths and theories behind one of America's greatest tragedies and the dark depths surrounding it.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

Great acting and incredibly thought provoking,  It does what I believe everyone should do, question your government and hold them accountable!",

            "content": "\"JFK\" is probably the only film in movie history where anyone who reviews it has to start off with a disclaimer:  Where do you stand on The Issue?\r\n\r\nFine.\r\n\r\nI first studied the Kennedy Assassination in a history class in high school called \"America Today\" that covered US history from 1945-until the mid-70s, which, at that time, was present day.  I went over the evidence with my classmates, and, like most of them, I came to the conclusion that there was no lone gunman, there were multiple shooters and providers of logistics and that it's highly questionable that Oswald was even one of the shooters, much less acted alone.  A few months later, as noted in a caption at the end of the film, a Congressional committee agreed with my conclusion.  So, although it's common for those who disbelieve the Warren Commission to be labeled as nutcases or people who need to wear tin foil hats, it should be noted as fact, NOT opinion, that there are conflicting reports from our own government on the subject.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer over.  Now, onto the movie.\r\n\r\n\"JFK\" is simply a masterpiece.  It shocks the audience and makes them think.  What a GREAT achievement for any movie!  That's not something you're going to get from most movies, and, in a country that obsesses over \"Dancing With the Stars\", it should be treasured as the masterpiece it is for that alone, but there is so much more to recommend it.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it has an ensemble cast to rival \"The Godfather\"  or \"The Longest Day\" in talent.  You have Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones (Oscar nominee), Kevin Bacon, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Ed Asner, Joe Pesci, and Gary Oldman.  I can't remember too many movies, before or since, with a better cast that used them all so well.  Not a single performance is wasted.  \r\n\r\nAnd, it's all held together by a TOWERING performance by Kevin Costner.  I'll pay Costner the ultimate compliment:  He infuses his character, New Orleans DA Jim Garrison, with the same courage, idealism and conviction that Jimmy Stewart brought to his performance in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\".  And, Costner's closing argument in the case is one of the greatest speeches in movie history rivaling George C. Scott's opening speech in \"Patton\", Burt Lancaster's trial speech in \"Judgment at Nuremburg\", Spencer Tracy's heartfelt plea for love and tolerance in \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner\" and Stewart's famous filibuster in the aforementioned \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\".  It's a remarkable, stunning sequence and, IMO, Costner didn't win the Oscar he was deservedly nominated for solely due to the controversial nature of the movie itself.  This is simply his best work.\r\n\r\nSecond, \"JFK\" is a technical marvel.  The period look is perfect.  Stone's decision to use an opening newsreel to give historical background followed by a sepia-toned prologue about the assassination is nothing less than brilliant.  And, quite simply, \"JFK\" has the most astonishing editing of any movie I've ever seen--cutting to different film stocks and types to denote flashbacks and events.  This movie makes facts, speculation and history simply sit up and breathe.  Quite an accomplishment.\r\n\r\nReserve plenty of time to watch it as it is well over 3 hours long.  But, I dare you to be bored by any of it.  And, if this is your first exposure to this subject matter, you also won't be able to resist researching it further.\r\n\r\nA final thought as to how I see the movie and its subject matter:  I'm struck by what Donald Sutherland's \"X\" character notes about the how and the why of JFK's murder simply being a parlor game for scenery.  Indeed, there is so much condemnation, ridicule and scorn heaped upon those who support any of the movie's theories that one wonders who the critics of the conspiracy theorists are trying to convince:  Those they criticize or themselves.\r\n\r\nIMO, in a country that claims to be a democracy, but, instead  has had a history of slavery, war profiteering, wars based on lies (the constant invocation and backdrop of The Vietnam War in JFK is spot on), environmental destruction, corporate oligarchy and government corruption at the highest level, it's beyond sad  that a conspiracy to kill a president who tried to do some good for our nation, with the conspirators never being brought to justice, is not beyond the pale, but, instead, is highly plausible.  \r\n\r\nIndeed, that scenario fits right in with the rest of American history.  \r\n\r\nAnd, THAT is the true, tragic power of \"JFK\", regardless of anyone's opinion about its methodology or subject matter.",

This is a truly unique movie - a dizzying three-hour conspiracy theory epic about historical events.  The movie throws an incredible amount of information at you, but is so well-made that you're able to follow it anyway. Oliver Stone isn't always the greatest filmmaker, but perhaps only he could have given us this one.\n\nThe film follows the efforts of New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner) in his attempt in the late 1960s to uncover the truth about the assassination of John F. Kennedy. As he delves into the official version of the story and into the lives of associates of Lee Harvey Oswald, he learns that the official version of the assassination by the Warren Commission - that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy - can't possibly be true. It is much harder to establish exactly what the truth is, however, as Garrison finds out in his encounters with a wide and sinister web of suspicious characters.\n\nKevin Costner in his glory days plays Garrison, and I think he gives a phenomenal performance. He's fierce and determined without being melodramatic, and his courtroom scenes are just riveting. Tommy Lee Jones is the embodiment of effete creepiness as Clay Shaw, a New Orleans businessman Garrison suspects of involvement in the assassination. Gary Oldman is a very mysterious yet sympathetic Lee Harvey Oswald. Joe Pesci, wearing possibly the worst wig and fake eyebrows in movie history, is terrifically energetic and weird as another suspect. Sissy Spacek is fine as Garrison's wife, though the character is mostly a shrill and peripheral one. A bunch of other actors, including Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ed Asner, Donald Sutherland, and John Candy, appear for a scene or two but make very strong impressions. \n\nThe film is a technical masterpiece, and indeed won Oscars for its cinematography and editing. It has incredible cinematography that hasn't aged a bit. The editing stuffs in quite a lot of disparate documentary sources, and is particularly amazing during the climactic trial scene as Garrison gives his long monologue explaining why the Warren Report must be wrong. The combination in this long final sequence of Oliver Stone's direction, Costner's performance, and the editing make it a stunning piece of filmmaking. It becomes powerfully persuasive, and (assuming none of the facts given in the sequence are made up) I for one left the movie convinced that there must have been a second shooter, and indeed that Lee Harvey Oswald may have been innocent altogether. That magic bullet theory, if the film is explaining it right, is plainly preposterous. Although I know at least some elements of the film are fictionalized, JFK is nonetheless  amazing.",

In regard to Oliver Stone's JFK, the film deals with the conspiracy that there was a second gun man who assisted Lee Harvey Oswald in assassinating John F. Kennedy. JFK is a good conspiracy thriller that I didn't expect to enjoy. However I was pleasantly surprised. Oliver Stone directs an impressive and talented cast of actors here. Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones really shine. I won't go into detail about the films plot as everyone pretty knows the story of this film. I thought that the plot was engaging enough to keep you interested from start to finish. Oliver Stone manages to grab your attention right from the start. The cast that star in this film make this film work well enough, and JFK is a pretty good conspiracy thriller. Though I wasn't particularly blown away by the film, I thought it was pretty good for what it was. JFK is a good film with plenty of twists to keep you guessing till the very end. Oliver Stone manages to keep you interested as the film demands the viewer to answer the questions that the film asks. Though I'm not really big into Oliver Stone films, JFK did entertain me, and if you enjoy conspiracy thrillers, you're most likely going to enjoy this one. The cast is terrific, and there are some great performances here and the film is complimented by a good story. I personally think that there wasn't a conspiracy in the JFK assassination, but to those who are interested in the topic; this film will definitely appeal to you.",

Add to that mix a brilliant ensemble cast, an epic length that slows down not for a single second and the best pairing of editing and cinematography in cinematic history and you have got one of the best films of all time.  \"JFK\" is the most ambitious outing for a director that has made a career out of raising controversy and it seems more factual than any documentary, which is a remarkable feat.

It presents an interesting enough topic to attract an audience of legitimate size, and that topic is the assassination of John F. Kennedy and  the conspiracy that surrounds it.\n\nSome may find it's length (which stands at an astounding 3 and a half hours) to be a turn-off. Some may be at odds with the way that the story is presented, which is somewhat a blend of fact and fiction. I'll say that at the beginning, I sort of felt the same way, too. But once you get about ten minutes in and the story picks up, you can't help but find it interesting. Like I said, it's an interesting enough topic. \n\nAnd the running time really isn't a problem. JFK whizzes right on by. Personally, when I spend money on a dvd, I like it to be a little long. Makes me feel like I got my money's worth.\n\nThe movie, as a whole, is very well-acted. It's got an ensemble cast, plus a couple of cameo-like appearances, and everyone is at the top of their game. The writing is great and so is the direction. They're not anything special or out-of-the-ordinary, but they're good, nonetheless.\n\nNormally, I'm not attracted by an Oliver Stone film. They're just something about them that doesn't spark an sort of interest in me. It may have something to do with his recent career turn. Maybe I should pay more attention to his mid 80's to mid 90's filmography. I can see that that's where most of the magic is.",

            "content": "Years later, no one could tell you the honest truth of who they think was behind John F. Kennedy's assassination. People have theorized endlessly about conspiracies, whereas some simply say Oswald was acting alone. Oswald was just raving mad, or Oswald was a devoted ex Marine with well trained skills. Whatever the verdict is now, there technically is no credible evidence as to whether or not there is a conspiracy, but some (such as myself) can't simply accept what the government calls \"the truth.\"\n\nThank God for a guy like Oliver Stone, for making a movie so risky and controversial that he knew society might scoff at. The way I see it, people treat politics as fragile as religion, therefore they don't allow any questioning. We know the theories and the statistics, but it takes a true visionary to make a sort of \"what if\" type film. Here, in this movie, we follow Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner) as district attorney of New Orleans. It's clear from the very beginning that Garrison is a man with determination. How he got where he is is never quite explained, but it can be implied (through a story he tells of taking on 9 men in court, and winning) he's a man who won't go down. Even as his interrogation of one of his accused conspirators (played by Tommy Lee Jones) rats him out and goes public he stays true to what he believes in. Now, history and facts aside, this is a great theme in other courtroom drama films (12 Angry Men, To Kill A Mockingbird) about integrity and going against what the accepted order is.\n\nIn \"JFK\" we follow Garrison's side of the story so well it's sort of automatic to side with him. Sure, the evidence he finds may have not been recorded by the Warren Commission or the CIA, and we can never really know what facts Stone may have made fiction. Regardless, it's an interesting attempt to expose what a lot of people to believe is a corrupt government. What Garrison fins ultimately as the film progresses, is that JFK's assassination isn't something could've been done by a man alone. Was it the mob? The Cubans? What he finds is an even more sinister plot. One to rule the country with menacing power. A force that still rules today--the government.\n\nSo what ultimatum could you come to? In a film like \"JFK\" the main character can only go so far with his supporters to get his theory understood. Now, when the movie comes to a close, it isn't necessarily important whether or not what we just saw was true fact. What is important is that the American people take to heart what the message of the movie was trying to deliver. Like the title card says at the end, \"What is past is present,\" our greatest fears may lie in what we put most of our faith in to built our country. There may be incomprehensible forces that can sabotage and destroy things, keep wars raging and certain political figures out of office. Pretty disturbing when you consider all the power the government has. \n\nRegardless of what this movie brings up, there will always be even more ludicrous theories presented. By now (and it's been 20 years since this film's debut) I expect people should at least learn from this movie. It holds as great an importance to America as \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" does. If SO MANY people are 100% positive on who killed Kennedy, then why does this subject never cease to stir controversy? Because people want to look for a conspiracy? I don't think so. People refuse to let it die, one so many eye witnesses can't shave away from their memory (no matter how many right wing or left wing bigots and stubborn politicians try and silence them). Hollywood as just put a frame around the much looked at problem. It's a mystery as broad as the pyramids, and one we might never conclude.",

The truth being - that the American people felt there was cover up in the JFK assissnation.  Ebert never suggests that JFK is factual and in fact seems certian that it is not, but he doesn't seem to care.  He likes the fact that Oliver Stone makes a movie like this, a movie that a documentary can't deliver - a movie that protrays feelings instead of facts.\r\n\r\nI agree with Ebert that JFK is well made movie - ranking it in the top 100 films of all time - I'm not so sure about that - I'm not even sure this is the best movie Oliver Stone has ever made.  At times JFK gets caught up in its questions - a birage of questions that are forgotten as soon as the movie is over.  It makes for a long winded and convulted argument.  It makes the movie way to long.\r\n\r\n  I'm also not a big fan of conspiracy theories in general - 9/11, walking on the moon, Martin Luther King - conspiracy theories often trivialize serious events, and turn them into comedy gong show that distracts from the true nature of the event.  Admitedly there are a lot of questions surrounding the death of JFK and if there is a conspiracy theory I'd be tempted to adhere to it would be Kennedy's assassination.  But still you can't watch JFK and honestly say Stone didn't set up a straw man.

It is in some cases, for lack of a better word, propaganda for the American dream and the alternative to a simple solution. It holds powerful moments and Oscar-worthy editing, and is an amazing movie in some contexts, but the methods of this film cannot help but be scrutinized. The fact that Oliver Stone believes that JFK is his Godfather, shows the ego behind such a (dare I say it?) overrated film.",

Jim Garrison who after seeing all the flaws,discrepancies,and downright incompetence and omissions in the Warren Report and other investigations,decides to launch one of his own in spite of the consequences.Along the way he finds alot of truth but also alot of formidible resistance.His investigation brings him time and again where the groundwork for the assassination began and implicated alot of powerful people and agencies.It involves conspirators we have heard in theories over and over again.The mob,the CIA,the Cubans,etc.And ties them together into a huge clandestine in plain sight cabal with the intention of killing the President and laying the groundwork for the highly lucrative to some Vietnam war.I will say this.Personally i do not believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone,i do not believe in a \"Magic Bullet\" and i know the best marksman in the world cannot get off three shots with a bolt action rifle in 6 seconds with deadly accuracy.If their was any truth to what Donald Sutherland told Kevin Costner in the D.C. scene,or Costners version of how things played out that day in his closing statement in the courtroom scene near the end,then President Kennedy has still not been avenged and many traitors and criminals have evaded justice!",

All the different conspiracy theories, unchecked facts and unanswered questions could very well have been answered or debunked before or since the movie's release over 20 years ago; but, the movie does such phenomenal work holding our hand through the nature of the scruples and then letting us think for ourselves when it reaches its many conclusions that just don't add up with the official report.  The editing is a slick mix of documentary footage, recreations, and voiceover narration that place the viewer right in the thick of the confusion and mayhem.  It's very very effective; more amazing is that it doesn't lose its efficacy, despite assembling a staggering amount of famous faces to lend their own small interpretation to history.  To his credit, Kevin Costner was tolerable, and perhaps a little more than that with this performance; it's too bad his family had to suffer at the hands of his obsession, but the family plot felt a bit too tacked on.  The family strife may have been true, but it was one of the few times in its whole length where it felt like a movie and not a History Channel special (that's bad).  It seemed like Stone put that in there so it wasn't just a bunch of neat little anecdotes and angles of the assassination all plastered together.  Sissy Spacek's impatient wife was probably there to lend cohesion.  Still and all, it's nice work on Stone's part (how did he get John Williams to lend his incomparable talents?) and it definitely evinces his zeal for the truth and his unwilingness to swallow everything his government tells him.",

Kevin Costner's character, Jim Garrison, can reasonably hope to prove that the official version is unlikely or impossible and that there is a conspiracy to hide the truth. Garrison asks questions that were never satisfactorily answered, and maybe have no answers. But the film isn't about what happened but about what the people feel about the truth that they've been told and the obsession of Garrison to find out the truth. Stone and its editors, Pietro Scalia and Joe Hutshing assemble all stories like a puzzle to finally introduce a character (played by Donald Sutherland) who puts everything together.

            "content": "It was November 22, 1963 and the eyes of the world (not just the United States) fell onto the streets of Dallas, where the assassination of president John F. Kennedy has taken place. Two days later, a man named Lee Harvey Oswald, who the FBI had interrogated about the prolific murder without recording a single piece of his statement, is shot dead by a Kennedy follower while being escorted outside of a station. Soon, an investigator Jim Morrison (Kevin Costner) stumbles onto the case, and finds many discrepancies and issues with the interrogation process...and history, to that of the apparent assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. He, along with a large of investigators, begins to piece together the locations and origination of Oswald before Kennedy's murder.\r\n\r\nWhether the film is fiction or non-fiction, with facts stretched beyond believability, this is a highly engrossing, thought-provoking, and believable film. The film stretches, and I go by the director's cut, of 205 minutes, and it doesn't lose its suspense for one minute. The many scenes of them questioning the relationship between Oswald and other men, including a wealthy guy named Clay Shaw and Bertrand (two last names, played by Tommy Lee Jones), plus the flashbacks are so fascinating. One particular scene with the flashbacks, and even the interrogation, with David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), who witnessed the associations with Shaw/Bertrand and Oswald is incredible well done (and well-acted as well). I suppose the small criticism with this movie is a scene of a fight between Morrison and his wife (Sissy Spacek), over ignoring his family. This scene, perhaps, may not have been needed, but somehow, it seemed well-suited. It is hard to say. The last 45 minutes in the courtroom are truly compelling. Political thrillers, such as \"All The President's Men\" and \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1963 version) have tendency to be exciting, and JFK definitely falls into this category of greatness.\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you watch this film and thought that Oswald was the assassin of JFK, your opinion might change. Mine may have, thanks to the in depth investigation of the murder and where the original gunshots had originated. Morrison believed that there were others involved and he continuously investigated, even still when Oliver Stone's film was being made. Tragically, he never was able to solve the mysteries, due to his death, the year after the release. Too bad! A man so heavily dedicated in solving Kennedy's murder failed to succeed.",

            "content": "JFK follows New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) as he latches on to loose ends poking out of Kennedy's assassination, and becomes obsessed with unraveling the threads. As the narrative plays out, we are treated to some of the most notable actors of all time who appear quite awkwardly. The long list of notables includes Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau and Sissy Spacek as Garrison's wife who is all but ignored as Garrison concentrates on conspiracy. Oddest of all is the appearance of Joe Pesci and Tommy Lee Jones, both of whom sported a bizarre hair-and-makeup job. But the real kicker is how Stone intersperses footage he shoots for the movie with newsreel footage of famous and infamous events and figures associated with the Kennedy assassination, the 1960s and Washington politics. This emotionally charged montage of images includes footage of crosses burning, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. as well as the Cuban missile crisis and of course the assassinations of Kennedy and Oswald. Most manipulative of all is the way Stone uses the newsreel footage with his own faux-aged footage to distort the past and blur the lines between reality and \"stonality\", for lack of a better word.\n\nTo be fair, Stone had somewhat noble motives in developing JFK - to remind the American people to not \"sin with silence\" (a quote from the movie), but as the saying goes the path to hell is paved with good intentions. Clearly, Stone advocates questioning leaders, holding them accountable and never letting government grow too powerful or dangerous. But film is the most powerful medium and when does revisionism and film manipulation grow too powerful or dangerous? Like a schoolyard bully who doesn't know the size of his own muscles, Stone creates such a powerful illusion, convincing narrative and emotionally loaded series of images that - as far as an ignorant populace is concerned - his film essentially unseats history in favor of its own agenda. What is that agenda? Stone's Garrison says it directly after the initial montage of footage ends: \"Today I am ashamed to be an American\". If JFK airs at least every year, that shame can be perennial.\n\nA new generation of moviegoers sees the Kennedy assassination not through history's lens, but through Stone's, forever impacting public perception about the most visible national tragedy next to 9/11/01. I won't get into an analysis of all the ways Stone's account differs from reality or the reasons he ignores and massages facts. For that I recommend an excellent Atlantic article, JFK: Oliver Stone's Fictional Reality, by Edward Jay Epstein, a real associate of the real Jim Garrison, as opposed to the make-believe associates of the make-believe Garrison, played by Costner. To Stone's fans who adore the film and believe it to be art and a great constitutional call to arms, I would caution that it is the height of irresponsibility in artistic license to use the death of a leader and a country's mourning as the launching pad to replace fact with fiction. Of course, Stone also works his own voice through Garrison's mouth in telegraphed ways - mostly about the military industrial complex, but also when Liz Garrison wants her husband to be with their kids. \"You know I don't like these tribal rituals,\" Garrison says of an Easter egg hunt.\n\nLike many figures whose lives have actually intersected with Stone's work, including Ray Manzarek of The Doors and Edward Jay Epstein of Jim Garrison's team, I find Stone's film not just irresponsible and factually inaccurate but purposefully manipulative in a reckless way. This review will no doubt generate its share of controversy, but that is what Oliver Stone invites: controversy.",

Kevin Costner is electric in his role and his last speech during the trial of Clay Shaw is powerful and really well executed.

The way Stone handles the broad array of different footage styles is professional and epic.  The acting is also fairly consistent, with Costner at his best and Oldman a perfect Lee Harvey Oswald.  John William's Epica Americana score also helps the film feel like a new classic.  Overall, it joins Nixon as one of Stone's best and most epic films.",

Therefore, I thought that this would be rediculously boring for three hours. I was wrong. It is actually about the New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, and his prooving of the conspiracy behind the Assassination of Kennedy. It is a well-acted and suprisingly entertaining film (at least for me). I was almost never bored in the film. There is some great cinematography and editing used in the film. However, I must admit that I did get kind of bored before the climactic and jaw-dropping last thirty minutes. After that, I was so astounded that I couldn't even talk.

            "content": "Please note that this review is over the director's cut of the film, clocking in at about 205 minutes. \n\nEveryone knows John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated, but the case was never open and shut from the beginning, and with this film, Oliver Stone hoped to show that. What we have here is a dramatized take on the efforts of New Orleans District Attorney and his team of colleagues to bring to light various conspiracies surrounding the death of JFK, including the only (to this date) public trial concerning the event.\n\nI knew from the beginning that this film was going to be heavy on historical revision, rejection/ignorance (as in purposely ignoring) of historical fact, and tons of conjecture, a lot of times without evidence, or at least substantial and credible amounts of it. I knew there'd be more questions and answers. And I knew that in general this film was going to be pretty inaccurate and take as much dramatic license as possible in the name of telling a great, engaging, and absorbing story. \n\nAnd, now that I've seen it, I can easily say that yes, this is a riveting cinematic experience. But, I do think it's overrated and not the full on masterpiece it's been touted as being. However, if you treat the film as having no relation to reality in any way whatsoever, ie as just a fictional investigation into a fictional assassination, it still holds up as a wonderful story about a guy determined to bring about truth and justice. But, it's not totally fictional. It's a look at probably the most well known assassination of all time. \n\nI honestly don't know what to believe in watching the film, and I'm not sure if Stone really knows the truth either. I'm not sure anyone does. That's not the point. The fact that people obsess over this case is a testament to its power. The fact that this is such a talked about and controversial movie is an even further testament to the strength of things. \n\nDespite some dodgy writing and conclusions, this film is a brilliant show of cinematography and editing, especially with the editing. The presentation, like some of Stone's other works, is a frenetic, schizophrenic explosions of various filters, lenses, formats, styles, and techniques, all in the name of artistry, symbolism, or some other sort of important reason. And...it works. It definitely makes for a unique experience, that's for sure. \n\nDon't ask me to name the whole cast. That'd be insane. I think Stone may have out Altmaned Altman on this one. The choices are excellent though, and it's nice seeing so many notable names, especially since a lot of them are in tiny roles or cameos, and many agreed to take pay cuts to be in the film.  Costner is absolutely brilliant as Garrison, and Rooker, Knight, Sanders, and Metcalf are all equally strong as his underlings. Gary Oldman knocks it out of the park as Lee Harvey Oswald, which I expected, but for me, the two best performances after Costner belong to Joe Pesci and Donald Sutherland.  Pesci's breakdown and Suther;and's monologue rank as some of the best moments of their respective careers, and the final courtroom monologue given by Costner is one of the most epic things ever.\n\nI really enjoyed this film despite its flaws. I feel it is definitely an important piece of work, because it really did open up a lot of eyes, and it did so in such a stellar cinematic way, but it didn't shake me enough to warrant the full grade that this sort of thing typcially illicits from me. Defintiely give it a watch though.",

JFK details the details that detail one of the most infamous days in American history, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is studied so hard in this film that it's an all out ambush on one's senses.  It's an epic and classic political thriller that stops for nothing in it's astonishing fast paced and ultra-kinetic narrative.  A film that every American needs to see, a triumpant and towering success that details a landmark of grief and sadness in Americana with absolute flawlessness.  Stone's visceral and bombastic trademark of storytelling is utterly effective here, it's a completely wicked punch of suspense, tension, history, and historical vividness that assaults the eyes and the mind.  Films like this just don't appeal to the masses, which is a seriously sad fact given the pure subject matter and historical accuracy (or inaccuracy as some believe.)  A movie of one man's determination to make a difference, to overcome all the fabrications and falsehoods in a quest for the absolute truth.  The movie that has it all, if it was related to the JFK assassination it's in this movie, all the conspiracies, all of the footage (even the shockingly graphic Abraham Zapruder footage) the truths, as well as the falsehoods.  Exceptional film making and completely stunning editing for the entire 3 hours.  Oliver Stone delivered masterpiece here.  An epic of politics, Americana, and historical significance that will never be matched.\n            Kevin Costner stars in a riveting and a pure performance of brilliance throughout.  It also stars Gary Oldman (the ultimate 90's villain) as Lee Harvey Oswald.  Electrifying performances by all involved including Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones, Michael Rooker, and Laurie Metcalf.  A steller cast with even better acting.

That in and of itself is a remarkable achievement, which can be credited to Stone's expert storytelling that is on display here, which keeps the film moving swiftly along towards the final showdown in the courtroom.\r\n\r\nKevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, a district attorney in New Orleans who decides to unravel the perceived conspiracy behind the assassination of JFK.  He, along with his staff, begin piecing together the various bits of evidence, chasing lead after lead and eventually setting their sites on a target to take to court as the only person to ever be prosecuted for involvement in the death of JFK.  That man is Clay Shaw, played with superb understatement by Tommy Lee Jones in one of the best performances of his career.  \r\n\r\nThe ordeal puts the kind of hardship on Garrison and his family that we often see in the \"fight the system\" legal thrillers, but it feels much more honest and real here than it does in other films.  Perhaps this is because Garrison was an actual person, or perhaps it is because of the performances of Costner and Sissy Spacek, who plays his wife, or perhaps, and most likely, it is a combination of the two.  Whatever the reason, the stakes surrounding this investigation feel appropriately high, which gives a great sense of weight to the finale of the film.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, Stone employs the best of the best in Hollywood in the supporting cast.  Along for the ride in supporting roles are Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman, John Candy, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Joe Pesci, and the list goes on.  Normally it would be distracting to go through a 3+ hour film and constantly see famous face after famous face pop up for a few lines of dialogue, but the actors do such a great job in their varying amounts of screen time that we actually buy them as the characters they play, rather than simply being there as celebrity cameos.  \r\n\r\nStone also does a phenomenal job of mixing real video footage of the time period with his own original footage of the actors doing their work.  It gives the film a sense of perspective and setting that might otherwise be missing, and it adds a sense of authenticity to the proceedings as well.\r\n\r\nEven though it clocks in at over 3 hours, Oliver Stone's JFK is a riveting legal mystery thriller that keeps its audience on the edge of their seats for the duration.",

Kennedy is not only extremely entertaining, informative, and mythological as the real event was, but is also the subject of many a probing into the death of one of the most celebrated American presidents of all time. Equally condemnatory on Garrison's obsession with studying this case to the point of driving his wife insane and his meeting with Mr. X (who brings an interesting theory as to why Kennedy was shot), this film is practically Oliver Stone's greatest achievement as a director. Forget about the schizophrenically sadistic \"Natural Born Killers\" and the stoic \"Platoon\" - for relative cinematic nirvana by one of America's most celebrated directors, \"JFK\" is hands down the way to go.\n\nWhile strange in presenting the alternate myth that Lee Harvey Oswald had absolutely nothing to do with the shooting and had actually acted with a group of homosexual renegades led by David Ferrie (Joe Pesci) just so he could get some information about this assassination attempt that they were going to do just because Kennedy \"gave the niggers their rights\", the film does accurately debunk the infamous \"magic bullet theory\" that Earl Warren gave to us. After hearing Costner explain how insane such a shot that is (and especially after looking at the Zapruder film through his eyes), we can either be convinced that Kennedy was killed just to kickstart the Vietnam War (and look what we made out of that) or that Stone is just a crazed nut.\n\nThe truth is: it's just a movie. Watch it and you'll like it. You'll find something that you haven't heard before. And trust me, I'll never look at the Zapruder film in the same way ever again.",

Not How. But Most Importantly Why?\r\n\r\nSynopsis: This movie is about the Assassination of Jesse James oops sorry The Assassination of JFK. The world is shocked by the assassination of JFK. It takes its toll on the American public but more on Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) the New Orleans District Attorney. Garrison has taken a personal interest in this fishy assassination and wants to get to the bottom of it. Battling with his wife he wants to show the public things the the government covered up in addition he's also battling over his marriage because of the time in effort put into the onion layered case. The battle for the truth starts now.\r\n\r\nMy Take: Before a start i would like to mention that it took me a solid 30 mins to adjust to the horrible accent of Kevin Costner. It was as painful and difficult as my eyes adjusting to a 3-D movie. Now thats out the way this movie was AWESOME. Evey one still today would like to know the entire truth behind JFK's assassination. Did the CIA do it? Was the FBI involved? Was the White House Involved? Did the Cubans kill JFK? How about Lee Harvey??? No one know but this movie tells off a damn pretty good theory. Highly believable, but i what i love most about this film is they explain why. Why would anyone want to kill JFK. CHANGE is a terrible thing to someone who is comfortable. CHANGE is mostly a unwanted risk. JFK was all about change and this could of possibly ended his young life. This movie explains so much about this whole conspiracy and so much about the true power the government has. Mass Media Control is probably the biggest. Oliver Stone really gets you involved in this one. The movie is 3hrs and 30mis long and i didnt blink. Possibly one of the best court scenes ever!! I was really pleased with this film and it gets a 5/5 from me true or not. Remember its all based of some facts and some theories.\r\n\r\nConclusion: I feel that any American is obligated to see this movie. Yes the acting is off and you can debate back and fourth of its authenticity but the fact still remains that this event took place right here in our back yards. Oliver Stone shows you every angle, every gap and every loop. This film was amazing and it explained allot of things i didnt know about the JFK assassination. Does it add up? Of course it does IMO, this was a great take on the whole plot. Remember that the movie is based off of 2 books by 2 different writers. I loved every minute of this long movie except Kevin Costner's horrible voice.\r\n\r\nAs a mentioned put aside the authenticity or the director adding his own views this movie is a Incredible Political Thriller!!\r\n\r\nMust See!\r\n\r\n5/5",

And JFK succeeds in this aim. In fact, the movie is so inspiring that the very word doesn't seem adequate to describe it--\"inspiring\" is so overused these days, when it should be kept safe somewhere in order to be taken out and used when describing things like JFK, especially the last 40 minutes or so, in which Jim Garrison's final speech to the jury makes even Atticus Finch look like one of those chimpanzees that can only string together a few words at a time in sign language. JFK makes your fingers shake and your heart pound (again, banal, but appropriate in this context); it's the kind of movie that makes you wander the house in a daze, and you're afraid to give even the slightest attention to anything else for many hours afterwards (a book, the news, another movie, tv, some random video your brother's watching on youtube) for fear of corrupting the emotions that have taken possession of you.

            "content": "Hmmmm...difficult to judge. On the one hand I enjoy the characters and the overall cinematography that subtly ties the film together, yet on the other I could have sworn that Kennedy survived Oswald's bullet to fight alongside a replicant Jose Canseco against Abraham Lincoln's psycho-ninjas during the Second American Revolution of 1912. I guess what it really comes down to are my criteria for good filmmaking versus historical accuracy (and when the History Channel kicks your ass in historical accuracy, you know you're f-ed). What do I enjoy more: quality directing or cyborg-JFK riding a woolly-hippopotamus into the Battle of Sugarlick Canyon?\r\n\r\nDamn...I guess I'm going to have to go with filmmaking on this one-which means the forgotten story of evil Lincoln uprising against the Bull-Moose Society will have to be shelved once again until America is finally ready to hear the truth. \r\n\r\nOliver Stone is one of those polarizing directors who can craft a perfect, memorable film but which-in retrospect-many people may want to forget. And while many of Stone's films such as Platoon and Nixon may bend a few facts to reach a higher truth, JFK is notably distinct in that it completely f-ing warps time and space to reach its conclusions. Shove a copy of Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States into a paper shredder then try to crazy glue the thing back together on the inside cover of a Dan Brown novel until the text resembles Lee Harvey Oswald doing the Surra de Bunda with Fidel Castro and you'll have a pretty decent idea of Stone's screenplay, if you catch my meaning. It's such a fun and engaging plot you can actually reenact it without leaving your couch, just wiggle your finger against your lips and babble loudly-it's like Oliver Stone is sitting right next to you, discussing his newest Wall Street movie!\r\n\r\nBut then I did promise I'd defend the artistic integrity of this film, didn't I. Yes, despite all my pointless bitching and ranting there's a lot to be praised with Stone's work. For one there's the superlative cinematography which expertly blends the use of various footage styles and formats into one seamless fusion of events. In fact, I'd be willing to bet that the indistinguishable use of both real and fictional footage is one of the reasons why some people find this film so engrossing while others find it so repugnant. At the very least it makes the film all the more powerful-after all isn't it filmmaking's greatest achievement to make the audience believe in the movie's reality? Then again, we do have people suffering from Avatar induced depressions don't we, so maybe all Oliver Stone really needed was to blow out the back of Kennedy's head...IN 3-D!!!\r\n\r\nComplementing Stone's directing is a cast that can only be described as \"all-star.\" In addition to Kevin Costner taking the lead role as Jim Garrison, we also have Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldham, John Candy, Sissy Spacek, that guy from 6th Day, that guy from Bad News Bears, and Newman from Seinfeld...okay, so maybe they're not all gold stars but at least we have a solid compilation of silver and bronze ones. Appropriately enough, the acting is well-executed as well and it's hard not to watch the terrific final courtroom scene without getting swept up in Costner's argument (this scene is particularly dear to me since I finally grasped the double irony of a similar scene from Seinfeld).Honestly, I would rank Costner's performance in JFK as probably the best in his career, although I'm sure my younger brother Stuart would vote for Waterworld...he's a simple kid. For everything this movie lacks in the coherent story department, it really makes up for in every other possible way.\r\n\r\nSo once again I have to ask where I stand on this film. Although handled with great technical and artistic expertise, Stone blurs the thin line between art and propaganda is beyond recognition with this one. Like a dog circling around a fire-hydrant, I just need to stand my ground and let the piss fall where it may. Perhaps the opinion closest to mine is Roger Ebert's-this isn't so much a pack of lies so much as it is a mood piece. No matter what the intent of this film is or was, it perfectly captures the emotions and reactions the average American harbored for their government after 1963. It was a mess. A clusterf***, if you don't mind the comparison to something substantially more organized and with fewer holes (in the story). Few things can ever quite reflect that loss of innocence, that dissolution of trust in the American government, or that overwhelming desire to understand just what the f*** is going on. In that sense, this film succeeds admirably. \r\n\r\nPost-script: I referenced it, so being a good little college-grad I should probably list my sources.

Oliver Stone managed the unimaginable transforming and almost folk tragedy, through a mix of drama and cinema veritè, into a riveting mystery thriller with the paranoiac style of a man who's in touch with paranoia in a quasi permanent basis. Unnerving, frustrating and spectacularly satisfying. Kevin Costner manages to be convincing as the center piece of the conspiracy theory. We believe the whole damn thing because we see it through his logic. Sissy Spacek, as his wife, represents most us and she does it brilliantly. Tommy Lee Jones and Kevin Bacon are a pleasure to watch. Donald Sutherland, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and even John Candy, Sally Kirkland and Vincent D'Onofrio deliver little parts of the puzzle without ever becoming distracting. Gary Oldman is a chilling dead ringer for Lee Harvey Oswald. For film lovers, for history nuts, for pop culture fanatics and for conspiracy theorists, this is a must. never gets old, perhaps one of the best films ever. Oliver Stone's best film, intricated and fascinating. excellent cast. one of the greatest montages ever made. Lousy history, absolutely perfect filmmaking. superb.",

In fact, his movie suggests five possible conspiracy theories;  1) Communists 2) Texas Oilmen and Defense Contractors 3) The CIA and anti-Castro forces 4) Mafia and 5) A military / industrial complex.  New Orleans DA Jim Garrison had his own opinion, and you may agree with him after listing to the persuasive dialogue of Mr X - who in real life was Colonel Fletcher Prouty of the Special Ops Force.  Since nobody credible has stepped forward to admit their complicity in such a conspiracy in nearly fifty years, it is difficult to agree with the conclusion of Garrison.  After all, we now know Mark Felt was Deep Throat, the informant of the Watergate crimes.  Anyhow, the conclusion of this movie is far less important to me than how they got there, and this movie had an excellent supporting cast, including John Candy, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland in surprising roles.",

The story was great as well and made us think what kind of a world we liveed in then and still do now but the biggest problem I have with the story/screenplay is the talking their was way too much talking in this film and especially the last court scene with Costner talking for almost half an hour and doing that will ake the film and the ending drag and drag some more.

            "content": "JFK, Great Movies\nIn the time since I first saw the film \"JFK\", I have found myself inexplicably drawn to the events in Dallas, TX on November 22, 1963. I have researched online and in libraries to learn the truth of these events, and I would say that my outlook on those matters has changed substantially. But underneath that, and the controversy that developed from it, there is one universal and almost indisputable truth regarding the film: JFK is simply an excellent movie. And no difference of opinion can refute this. I have seen my fair share of films over the years, I'm not a cinema maniac by any means. But I think I can judge a quality product when I see one and that's simply what this picture presents. It is, as Tom Wicker of the New York Times said at it's release, propaganda; but the same can be said for every film by Michael Moore... of whom I'm NOT a fan... but they are still strong pictures. JFK runs the difficult task of presenting fact, fiction, conjecture and opinion, twisting them all to present the increasingly difficult to dispute conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone (and according to director Oliver Stone, did not act) in the assassination of President Kennedy.\nThe films accomplishments though, past this controversial thesis, are many: \n1.) Kevin Costner turns in one of the greatest performances of his career. While his accent is stronger than Garrison and the physical resemblance not astonishing, Costner three dimensionalizes a character and lives in it throughout the film.\n2.) An impressive and versatile cast is used superbly. The film is loaded with quality stars such as Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones (in an Oscar nominated role), Gary Oldman, and Joe Pesci (who share an intense and crucial scene); as well as character actors and actresses such as Michael Rooker, Sissy Spacek, and Jay Saunders. Stone even navigates a dramatic turn from the late comedy great John Candy and utilizes Hollywood legends Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Donald Sutherland superbly.\n3.) With the possible exception of the lone gunman theory, every possibility of truth is explored, at least in dialogue. Because the case has never been fully elaborated on no one can say for certain what the truth is; Stone presents all views while advancing his theory.\n4.) The film is a masterwork of editing. It won the Oscar for film editing in 1991, and deserved it. I once read in Entertainment Weekly that a normal film has roughly 200 cuts in it; there are more than sixty in the opening minutes alone here. Even more impressive when you consider the variety of film used.\nJFK is not absolute fact, it does not truly pretend to be. By Stone's own admission, Laurie Metcalf, Michael Rooker, and Kevin Bacon play composites or dramatized characters, not the real thing. But standing alone as a movie, JFK is untouchably excellent. And if it does force you to question, as Costner's Garrison asks in the closing moments \"of what is our government made?\", then it's all for the better.",

I'm not sure if Oliver Stone's point was to make these conspiracies come true but rather just tell that story as it happened. A Louisiana DA learns certain information about a case and thus pursues what he believes to be the truth. Perhaps a black ops coup is a little out there, but the fact that his office was bugged and many of his key witnesses have since died does make the story interesting.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of Sissy Spacek, but that may be an issue with the writers. I never understood the scenes were the wife can't believe her husband is pursuing something we the audience can see is worthwhile. Besides that, I enjoyed the storytelling and will say the scene with Donald Sutherland explains a lot in a short amount of time, but it was still enjoyable. Much like a Law and Order episode.",

But it is also brilliant. It carves its drama based on actual events -- the assassination of the thirty-fifth president of the United States, John F. Kennedy. What is mesmerizing about JFK is its meticulous approach to adapting a real life historical phenomenon through known actors and its disinterring deductive arguments. JFK is skeptical, yes, but it also does not flinch in telling a story. It becomes so eager in exposing the clandestine assassination that the film becomes a conspiracy itself. Oliver Stone tells a convincing tale and he covers every angle. By the end of it all, you'll be locked in Stone's conscience. It tells you what the director think happened but that does not necessarily make it true or defined. It reveals only the possible. After such an unexpected event, there needed to be an angle. Something to point us in a direction, whether it is valid or not.\r\n\r\nJFK does not perhaps work as a reliable history lesson, because history class inhibits facts and is hesitant on interpretation. Stone acts as a dramatic historian -- it allows him to incorporate his opinions in the factual evidence. What dirt can this director dig up? His story revolves around the real life story of Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), a New Orleans District Attorney who applies witnesses, evidence, and pure conjecture in discovering who, in fact, killed Kennedy. Stone, though far from my favourite directors, plays his cards right here. Stone often got wrapped up in character-centred stories (Natural Born Killers and Alexander) that it snared his ability to tell a general story around a pursuable onlooker. JFK is a kinetic causal pyramid not a forgettable cat and mouse game. Events build up to a pinnacle pay off. Okay, so Stone eventually relinquishes to court room drama, but he will save himself (I promise, I will elaborate later on).\r\n\r\nJFK has a stellar opening. It presents itself onscreen as an intellectual tool. It's in documentary style and the commencing credits allude to the cocking of the gun that shot Kennedy. Through documentary footage alone, Stone grabs our attention. Then JFK snowballs into a back and forth narrative of Garrison's journey in revealing the culprits of the assassination and then effortlessly cutting to the pre-assassination shenanigans between the suspects: Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman), Guy Bannister (Edward Asner), and Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones). Well, the last two are actually witnesses who interacted with Lee Harvey Oswald. They may just be the gateway to unraveling something much more intricate and elaborate than anyone once thought. That's what drives JFK. Its mystery floods the screen. The characters's motives are so vague that we can't help but allow Stone to gradually reveal them to us. \r\n\r\nStone's film is compacted with credibility because it interprets a real life story that questioned the assassination. It's not just Stone's thoughts, it's his dramatic application on another's thoughts. In the end, they ultimately have to be perceived as the directors. His build is extravagant. His pace is slick. There are numerous things happening at once but Stone always provides a voice over to guide us through the sequences. We watch each event and put the pieces together ourselves. By the end of JFK, we have our own little conspiracy theory.\r\n\r\nThere is even a laconic scene involving Donald Sutherland, playing a retired agent named X. As cliché as the pseudonym comes across, the rendezvous between X and Jim untwines another thread of the plot. As X claims, he can provide Jim with the background, all Jim needs to do is establish the foreground. It is subtext: to all the audience, it is up to you to put it all together. Stone will provide us with the skeptical theories and our interpretations will undoubtedly rectify. Don't be surprised. Your solutions may precisely compare to the directors.\r\n\r\nStone also handles the family side to Garrison's life with care. We are compelled to watch Jim interact with his concerned wife (played by Sissy Spacek) and his few children because Stone ascertains an important dilemma. Jim is distant from his family because he wants to create a just country for his children. Not a place where we will always bury our head in the sand. His wife insists he is not loving anymore; his impassive approach to them is crushing. Especially in these times. Stone envisions this scenario properly: to certain degrees, both Jim and his wife are both right.\r\n\r\nJFK slightly underplays itself in the third act. Garrison endures a trial against Clay Shaw, claiming he was an accomplice in the assassination. Inevitably, JFK had to wallow in courtroom drama, for this is what happened in Garrison's tumultuous yet esteemed career in 1969. Stone is toying with historical inquiry not historical fact. But that climactic turn is just so unwelcoming. JFK starts to conclude its ideas on a too literal note. It feels as if Jim Garrison is talking at the camera -- with a sombre retrospective, he feeds us his ideas. For a director, it is too obvious. Too plain. But in all fairness, Stone rescues this sequence through some suave editing. After a daunting ten minute speech by Costner, the recollecting events combine into a flawless answer. Stone has his interpretation delivered on a silver platter.\r\n\r\nStone masters JFK because he fulfills the story with pungent ideas and palpitating drama. Was the government in fact involved in killing their own leader? Okay, that's a stretch, Stone. Or is it? JFK is that good with its persuasiveness. It covers every angle up until no other reasoning seems applicable or available. Just Stone's. JFK, as a result, is more of a historical theory than a cinematic afterthought. It handles this daunting event with emotion, dilemmas, mystery, and a myriad of questions. Was there something more to Kennedy's killing that didn't end with Oswald? One thing's for sure, there is something more to Stone. He truly is a virtuoso in historical drama. \r\n\r\nI SAY--See It.",

Anything you ever thought about the JFK assassination will be thrown out the window once you watch this movie. It is the most in-depth and detailed movie i have ever seen. An amazing script that brings to life \"the shot heard around the world.\" \r\n\r\nIt's like a movie with a documentary style. A great story about Jim Garrison, the DA of New Orleans, who is still the only person to make a case over the murder of president JFK. It's a movie that throws the facts in your face and you can't help but listen, watch, and wonder...what did really happen, and why? This film as an amazing look inside the U.S. Government, and what they can really do.\r\n\r\nWhether or not you believe everything the movie gives you...you can't say with confidence that Oswald actually pulled the tigger and did the shooting. There is just too much against the theory. I love this movie because it seems like it's something the American people were never supposed to know. It seems like we are all behind the scenes, and witnessing something that was supposed to be covered up for all time. Now it is out there...forever. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this is Oliver Stones best movie. I havent seen them all, but for sure one of my favorites of all time. \r\nIt's one long, intersting history class that takes you along for a crazy ride into the facts behind this case, that was held three years after the shooting.\r\n\r\nThis movie also played a major role in the national debate that led to the passage of the 1992 Assassination Materials Disclosure Act. To me, that speaks volumes to how good this movie is, that it is so powerful, and had such an impact, that an Act of Congress was passed because of it.\r\n\r\nJust a great watch. A long movie that really has some amazing filming techniques. Sometimes goes a little fast, but gives some great angles and looks from everybody's point of view. \r\n\r\nIt's a movie that leaves you thinking and pondering. A mystery thriller, about the greatest mystery in the history United States.",

He was about 13 or 14 at the time and KNEW it could not possibly have been Oswald.  As an adult, after he'd achieved some fame, he said he was at a party and started telling people what happened.  A man quickly pulled him aside and threatened him, saying he had better never say that out loud again. People don't like having their delusions shattered, I assume that's the only reason Americans are still buying that crap story.  You could shoot a million holes in that f'ed up coverup tale.",

JFK sucked me right into the story, and kept me interested throughout its 3 and a half hour runtime. I was also very impressed with the films stellar cast and their performances, which bolstered JFK to being a better than average political thriller. I loved John William's musical score as well, which when played, put a sense of hope and justice into the films atmosphere.\r\n\r\nJFK overall is a brilliantly filmed political drama with a awesome cast, great acting, an uplifting soundtrack, and a interesting yet flawed plot.

Examples include the not so pristine \"magical bullet\", which only looks pristine from one angle, and the physics of why JFK's head went \"back and to the left\" after the last shot. \r\n\r\nI would recommend that book, or even the more recent \"Reclaiming History\" by Vincent Bugliosi- which I haven't read- for those reasonable souls that still have any lingering suspicions about JFK's death. The truth is, Lee Harvey Oswald, a former military sharpshooter, Castro sympathiser and American defector killed JFK alone from the book depository where he worked because he was nuttier than a squirrel turd. No conspiracy. With today's forensics, the state of the art in JFK theory is the lone gunman, Oswald. (Thankfully someone in Hollywood has finally come around. Tom Hanks has an upcoming miniseries on HBO that will back up the non-conspiracy crowd, still just 25% of Americans.) \r\n\r\nWith that said, I still like this movie quite a bit. Call me a hypocrite, but if I'm flipping through the channels and it's on, I watch it. I can't help it. It has a great cast and Oliver Stone has a way with editing and camerawork, even if what he's saying is a crock. It's an entertaining conspiracy thriller.

Kennedy or the conspiracy theory surrounding it.  The more I learned, the more I leaned toward the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy himself, and he probably without any backing from anyone else.\r\n\r\nIronically, it was Oliver Stone who set me on the path to skepticism.  I was so taken in with this film that I couldn't believe anyone was still arguing that there wasn't a second gunman.  Then I saw an interview where Oliver Stone where he admitted to changing facts and fabricating entire scenes.\r\n\r\nEven back then I understood that filmakers would often play around with the truth in autobiographies and historical films.  Sometimes this is done out of necessity, like when three crucial real life events are crammed into the shoot-out at the Little Bohemia Lodge in \"Public Enemies\".  Other times it is done to add to the suspense of a movie, such as the phone call at the end of Frost/Nixon which never happened.\r\n\r\nBut this wasn't just artistic license at work.  Oliver Stone had an agenda.  He was so passionate in his belief that the country had been lied to, and he was trying to sell me on that belief.  And he HAD sold me on it.  But the best way to prove if someone is an enlightened genius or just some conspiracy nut is if he has to lie to get you to believe him.\r\n\r\nStone went beyound just changing or adding a few speculative scenes to tighten his movie and make it more dramatic.  He flat out lied about well documented facts.  In the movie, Jay O. Sanders tells Kevin Costner that Ozwald couldn't fire the three shots in the 5.6 seconds established in the Zapruder film.  In reality, it's over 8 seconds between all three shots.  He says that Ozwald was interrogated for 12 hours with no report of it when there are several reports of it interrogation in the \"Warren Commision Report\".  He says that the police purpsefully neglected to test the rifle to see if it had been fired, when there was no way they COULD test it because the technology didn't exist.\r\n\r\nThese weren't oversites.  Stone purposely changed these facts (and countless others) to try and pursuade us into falling in with his belief system.  And judging by the film's rating and reviews, he's doing a good job.\r\n\r\nMy advice, enjoy the movie as a pretty work of fiction.  If you're looking for evidence of the truth, try \"The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy\" or do some research yourself.",

Yes, I was naive, but whether I believed the film or not it  was unimportant as it got me interested in learning more about the gov't and flow of money and power. That's what makes great movie making, sirring the collective conscious into asking questions. It also provided a great skit to comedy show Seinfeld. The film did blur the lines between reality, fact and cinematic license. Anyone watching this film as a \"documentary\" on JFK's shooting is fooling themselves as much as anyone who believes Fox News reports actual facts without an agenda. Both are great examples of propganda. It's obvious that JFK meant a great deal to Stone and his generation and he's not satisfied with the investigation and the \"official\" conclusions from said investigaion. He does make some compelling arguements but again everything can't be taken verbatim like the Magic Bullet theory which to Stone and many others makes the case for a 2nd shooter on the Grassy Knowl. The History Channel did a recent special where they analyized the bullets trajectory and again it seems like a \"magic bullet\" until you move the 2nd person in the car that got hit into a different position. Then the bullet ravels in a straight line as to be expected. Why 40 some years earlier the investigators figure that iut I don't know. And that's if you believe the History Channels' investigation. Either way even if you do believe the History Channel as oppossed to the Magic Bullet theory it doesn't answer a lot of other questions raised in the film. If you're interested in this subject I suggest you watch both. Cinematic wise, the film is some of Stone's best work. Solid acting, pacing and editing. And most of all it's a film tha engages the emotions and intellect of the viewer.",

Kevin Costner does a fantastic job portraying Jim Garrison, the New Orleans DA who is convinced that there is a massive conspiracy behind President Kennedy's assassination, and that he has all the answers to it. Oliver Stone captures perfectly within this film the grief experienced by the American public following the assassination and the subsequent distrust of the US government following the Warren Commission's report.

This film inspires feelings of patriotism and a yearning to fully understand what happened in Dallas on that November day in 1963.\r\n\r\n\"JFK\" is an excellent piece of fiction. So excellent, in fact, that it has essentially brainwashed a great number of viewers into believing everything in this movie is true. Actually, Oliver Stone took many liberties with this \"true\" story, and did not keep the facts straight. Stone made things up as he went along, in order to make Garrison seem like the hero who solved the conspiracy \"mystery.\" Anyone watching this movie would think Clay Shaw and the CIA were, without doubt, behind the Kennedy assassination. Oliver Stone has made an innocent man guilty in the minds of thousands of Americans who will believe any bullshit they happen to see on the silver screen. Yes, this could have been a classic movie, but Oliver Stone took history and distorted it in order to make a movie that would entertain rather than inform.

            "content": "Remarkably Boring for Such a Controversial Movie  \r\n\r\nFacts are not determined by popular vote.  It's considered a logical fallacy to say \"such-and-such is true because most people believe it's true,\" \"so many people can't be wrong,\" or what have you.  Now, I admit that one of the examples I use to explain how egregious the \"ideas\" in this movie are is that almost every conspiracy theorist in the business--and I have to tell you that the die-hard JFK conspiracy theorists are crazier than the die-hard Moon hoax people, though not as crazy as the die-hard 9/11 conspiracy theorists--backed away slowly when they heard that Oliver Stone would be championing Garrison, crazy by crazy conspiracy theorist standards.  On the other hand, I don't need that to point out the enormous flaws we're dealing with here.  It's just funny.  Note that I will only mention as an amusing aside that Walter Cronkite ripped Roger Ebert a new one for his positive review of this piece of crap, stating categorically how factually incorrect it is from start to finish.  That's just funny, too, despite how much I respect Roger.  I bring this up, though, to remind people that \"But [insert enormous percentage here] of the American people think it was a conspiracy!\" carries no weight as far as evidence goes.\r\n\r\nFor reasons that surpass understanding, someone over on IMDB has put the beginning of the movie in spoiler tags in the parents' guide.  But John F. Kennedy was dead, to begin with.  Crusading New Orleans District Attorney (TM) Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) is shocked, the more so because he's in the South, where not everyone necessarily thinks Kennedy's death was a bad thing.  One day, on an airplane, he's talking to Louisiana Senator Russell Long (Walter Matthau), who sets Garrison to thinking that there's maybe something fishy about the assassination, that maybe Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) didn't act alone.  The version of Oswald and the assassination he tells does seem awfully improbable--there are good reasons for that--and it sends Garrison in search of the Real Killers (TM), who logically must be from New Orleans, because Oswald spent his childhood and a few months of his adulthood there.  He determines that the conspiracy involves David Ferrie (Joe Pesci) and Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) for reasons that are so stupid that Oliver Stone doesn't mention them.  (Apparently, gay people always use their first names but different last names when they're coming up with alibis!)  He fights to keep close to his family (Sissy Spacek, acting rings around Costner) while all the while gaining the ridicule of a nation.\r\n\r\nBut, to the curious, the reason he gained the ridicule of a nation was that his ideas were stupid.  No, really.  And Oliver Stone didn't help himself by adding in the rampant speculation and known lies of another nut, L. Fletcher Prouty, putting in an ahistorical appearance wherein he is played by Donald Sutherland.  (Prouty is a Holocaust denier, the nuttiest nuts of all.)  Both men are known to have taken, shall we say, flights of fancy, and they've taken Stone--and the audience--along for the ride.  The thing you will notice about both their ideas of conspiracy is that they require a lot of people.  Midway through the film, Bill Broussard (Michael Rooker) says a mafia conspiracy is more believable than the one Garrison is positing, given that the twelve people in the room have a hard time keeping quiet.  Garrison mocks him for this, but it's an awfully good point.  Notably, Garrison--and this is true of the man, not just the character--tends to assume people are telling the truth when they're saying what he wants to hear.  Oswald says he was a patsy?  Well, Oswald was telling the truth!  Clay Shaw says he's never used the name \"Clay Bertrand\" in his life?  He's a dirty liar!  Critical thinking does not happen in this movie.\r\n\r\nBut okay, let's move beyond that.  I will admit that I have a hard time being objective about this film, because the history is so awful--and we'll get back to that--and I was all prepared to write a really angry review.  Only I kind of can't.  Oh, I can be snippy.  I can be rude.  But angry?  Frankly, I don't have the interest to be angry about the film.  Stone goes out of his way to make Garrison a more sympathetic character--the real Garrison was not as personable as Costner by a long chalk.  We are shown the strain the case puts on his family.  He is hurt by all these lies everyone is telling about him.  He is a good, kind man who just wants to do right by a country he thinks is betraying him.  He's just so hurt by the whole thing.  But you know, when he's going on for, jeez, it must be at least five minutes at the end of the movie, not even Costner's actual genuine tears get me into things.  Stone is not a bad filmmaker, and I'm actually quite looking forward to getting to some of his other films.  This one is just tedious.\r\n\r\nYes, okay, there is a conspiracy here--there are people who are really trying to keep us all in the dark.  There are people lying to us and trying to cover up evidence which doesn't suit their conclusions.  They are pushing a story which doesn't fit history.  And Jim Garrison was one of them.  Simply put, no one could look at the actual evidence, not the lies and misconceptions here, and really see anything but one lone crazy trying to be famous and important.  Not if they're looking objectively.  It's been said that the reason people believe it was a conspiracy is that the accounts don't seem to balance if it's just Lee.  (Okay, and hands, please--who wishes they could have seen Neil Patrick Harris in the role on Broadway?)  \"Back and to the left\"?  Makes complete sense given physics and anatomy.  \"Magic bullet\"?  Fails to take into account the actual seating in the limo.  And so on.  Even the brain thing--evidence points to Bobby Kennedy's having had it buried with his brother when they moved the body to its current grave.  No, they won't resolve everything, but enough evidence is there that there is no reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let me just present three websites.  The first is a good overview of the assassination as a whole and all the stupid ideas people have about it.  The second is a list of 100 historical errors in the film.  The third is a forum you can go to in order to discuss it, should you think I'm wrong--or even to be snarly at CTs if you think I'm right.\r\n\r\nhttp://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/home.htm\r\nhttp://www.jfk-online.com/jfk100menu.html\r\nhttp://apollohoax.proboards.com/index.cgi?",

            "content": "Oliver Stone's revisionist history lesson, \"JFK,\" created a lot of controversy upon its release for embracing the conspiracy theories toward President Kennedy's assassination. Stone focuses the story on New Orleans DA Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), who leads an investigation into the assassination and brings a case to trial against businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), whom Garrison believes was involved in a conspiracy to kill the President. Garrison's investigation leads him to interview a wide range of government officials and civilians who may have knowledge of what happened. Stone broadly implicates everyone from the mafia to the KGB to LBJ to Castro and more for being responsible for the assassination. This is pure speculation, and even if some of the theses are intriguing, Stone doesn't differentiate between fact and fiction. He wants to paint with a broad brush that points the finger at everyone. Its a morally offensive approach that justifies conspiracy theories without reservation. The portrayal of Jim Garrison as a heroic figure is questionable and the relationship between Garrison and his wife (Sissy Spacek) is bland. \"JFK\" is all exposition, and even if the movie holds our attention it has no dramatic arc. In filmmaking technique, Stone incorporates color with black and white, archival footage, photographs, and historical reenactments for the purpose of propaganda. The large ensemble cast includes Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Walther Matthau, John Candy, Laurie Metcalf, Michael Rooker, Vincent D'Onofrio.

            "content": "JFK to me is the best docu-drama of all-time.  It is one of Oliver Stone's finest movies and the entire cast is superb.\r\n\r\nJFK tells the story of Jim Garrison and his pursuit to solve the JFK assassination conspiracy.  In 1963 when Kennedy was killed everyone was led to believe that the shooter was Lee Harvey Oswald.  However, three years later, Garrison played by Kevin Costner looks back at the shooting and reads about the happenings after.  Slowly, he starts finding clues that he believes prove that there was a conspiracy behind the assassination.  He believed that Kennedy's own staff and the CIA planned and executed the assassination.  Due to the fact that they knew Kennedy was never going to go to war in southeast Asia.  Even through his extensive research and fact finding.  Garrison was never able to prove his beliefs.\r\n\r\nJFK is very well done thanks in part to Oliver Stone's beautiful direction.  It is easy to tell that he spent a lot of time on the film both during and after production.  The look of the film is gorgeous as we get a wonderful take on a 1960/70 New Orleans.  Stone also provides real and staged footage of the assassination, but you would never know thanks to the crisp editing and cinematography.  Even though the movie is over 3 hours you never get tired thanks in part to the great screenplay and very natural direction.\r\n\r\nAnother great part of JFK is the cast.  It is filled with big name after big name and each actor gives it there all.  Kevin Costner is great as Garrison, playing him as a man who knows the truth, but just has to find a way to prove it.  Other contributors are Jack Lemmon, Edward Asner, Tommy Lee Jones, John Candy, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman as Oswald, Walter Matthau, and Joe Pesci is a standout as David Ferrie a man who is a suspect in the case and is very jittery and on edge because he is afraid to die.  All in all, JFK compiles one of the greatest ensemble casts of all-time.\r\n\r\nJFK is a must see movie about the conspiracy over the John F. Kennedy assassination.  It is a drama, but could also be considered a documentary because of how telling it is and how real it feels.  JFK truly is one of the best movies ever made because of how well it works at every level of film.",

It?s said that he?s a director looking for too much of a gut reaction, that his movies are too obvious and that he preaches to the already fully converted. Similarly, it evokes nostalgia when one considers that Kevin Costner was once the biggest star of his day ? with movies such as Field of Dreams, Dances with Wolves and The Untouchables achieving huge success despite the actor?s often wooden, pedestrian delivery. So, I came very late to this film with not too much anticipation.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, this is an energetically paced run through the event that has provoked more conspiracy theory literature and celluloid than any other. Pacy and creatively edited, the action switches from city to city with scarcely a moment to breathe. I couldn?t comment on the accuracy of the film?s assertions although the opening frame that sees Dwight Eisenhower speak of the ?military-industrial complex? is a nice touch. Most of the actors turn in good performances, with Gary Oldman and Joe Pesci especially memorable. Only at the end does the pace flag ? given the inevitability of a court decision for which we already know the outcome, coupled with the dullness of Costner?s brow beating speech, straight out of a propaganda piece and unfitting for a film: this is the only place where Stone is guilty of hectoring; otherwise, this is a decent movie.",

As for the film itself, a lot of it will come down to whether or not you enjoy Oliver Stone's films and where your stand on the Jim Garrison conspiracy theory. Thankfully it doesn't try and shove it down our throats, but rather gives us enough information so that we can leave asking more questions than when we started. For most subjects this would be frustrating, but not so in this case. It's as complex a case as any, and should be taken on with renewed interest rather than anger and outrage over the possibility of government involvement, as previous generations have done.

            "content": "Oliver Stone has created his masterpiece, in my eyes, with 1991's \"JFK,\" a film about John F. Kennedy's assassination and one man's obsession of finding out the \"truth\" about who shot the president. Historians have ripped the film apart for its inaccuracies and flaws in logic to the point where the film can't be seen as what really happened on that infamous day in November 1963, but I find it being wrong in the facts department to be quite arbitrary: it's still an interesting story with an urgent narrative and the kind of film details -- film editing, cinematography -- that are frequently studied in film classes. It's a movie based on opinion, and so what if the opinion has proved to be faulty; \"JFK\" is a testament to free speech -- isn't it great to have that at our disposal?! -- and the emotions that overpower our logic.\n\n\nWhile the title suggest that Kennedy plays an active role himself, he is only seen in brief, grainy home video footage that plays over in the film's most powerful scenes. Instead, the film follows Jim Garrison, a New Orleans district attorney (played by Kevin Costner) that believes without a shadow of a doubt that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone (or, perhaps, wasn't even responsible for the assassination) on November 22, 1963 and that we were deceived by the Warren Report that claims that Oswald was the lone gunman. Claiming a conspiracy on the government's part is a very risky thing, but to Garrison everything doesn't seem right: witnesses claiming they saw something over a grassy knoll, Oswald is conveniently murdered before a trial could be put together, and the bullet that killed Kennedy had a near to impossible route to make the police reports factual.\n\n\nA three hour film about a man obsessing over Kennedy's assassination? How could this be thrilling entertainment? \"JFK\" is not a spectator's film -- it insists you invest at least some emotion while Garrison fetches clues to solve a grand-scale murder mystery that already has an answer -- and is three hours long with \"clues\" that, at the end of the day, could just as well be dead ends. We aren't any closer into figuring out who killed John F. Kennedy than we were before watching \"JFK,\" but isn't the thrill of watching one alternate scenario play out enough? For me, it was.\n\nTo study this film is to analyze an expertly crafted epic drama from a director that constantly forces his audience to think outside of what we are taught -- his 1986 war film \"Platoon\" has a very different view of the Vietnam War: The United States weren't always the \"good guys.\" From a technical standpoint, this is a film teacher's dream: the film shifts from the present (in this context, 1966) to the infamous day (November 22, 1963) at lightning fact speed, with a film technique that allows a viewer to know if they are watching something from the past or present -- the past footage of \"witnesses\" is played in grainy black and white. This isn't an acting piece -- several of the high profile actors waved their usual fees to work for scale, as they considered the project too important to pass up -- but the performances are solid; Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw, a shady businessman that Garrison suspects to be a big part in the conspiracy is a standout. It should be noted that there is no attempt on Kevin Costner's part to play Jim Garrison as a complicated character with a level of acting prowess that Costner has never shown; Costner plays Garrison as a man with simple emotions, gaining respect as a capable leading man here. It's a thankless job, but Costner wisely knows that this isn't the time to try and put on an overblown acting performance in hopes of an Academy Award nomination. It's a movie that is larger than life, and the actors have the easiest job of the movie (a statement you aren't likely to hear in many of my reviews) -- the blunt of the responsibility is placed on director and co-writer Oliver Stone's shoulders and everybody must share in his passion to bringing this tale to the screen.\n\nWhen it's all said and done, do I believe in Jim Garrison's theories? It's an opinion, but I don't. I find it quite \"convenient\" that Lee Harvey Oswald was able to successfully achieve what he did on November 22, 1963 all by himself, but I doubt the government killed Kennedy. Maybe Oswald had an accomplice with him that somehow got away? Maybe Oswald was a lucky shot? Maybe. Regardless of my feelings on the Kennedy assassination, I find \"JFK\" something I can get lost into easily. It's somewhat cheesy and tactless to call a movie with such a plot line as entertaining, but such is by far my opinion of the film.",

Nonostante la corposa durata,\"JFK\" non pesa affatto,anche grazie al geniale montaggio (Oscar meritatissimo) di Pietro Scalia: ha il merito di riproporre con vigore uno degli interrogativi piu'inquietanti del Ventesimo secolo, elaborando una tesi strutturata in maniera credibile, e, almeno in parte, purtroppo verosimile. Stone individua il Male che avvelena la sua America nella mafia,nei servizi segreti deviati,nei politicanti corrotti,secondo lui colpevoli di proteggere un fascismo clandestino. Kevin Costner interpreta con passione Jim Garrison, il procuratore distrettuale che oso'contestare la versione ufficiale della commissione Warren: ne fa un uomo con vari difetti, ma mosso dal fuoco dell'idealismo, e dopo un accorato monologo, prima della conclusione, molto amara, del film, ne esce sconfitto.Tecnicamente il miglior film di Oliver Stone, complessissimo, va visto almeno due volte per essere apprezzato come si meriti,per la quantita'incredibile di informazioni che invia a chi lo guarda.",

Instead, this tale based on Jim Garrison's pursuit of the truth behind the JFK assassination is a tightly woven conspiracy theory thriller.

Which would explain why there are so many big name actors playing some very minor roles.  While Oliver Stone might play fast and loose with some of the facts of the case, he himself admits that this film is merely his \"counter-myth to the myth that is the Warren Commission\".

That said, I think the CIA had a good deal of involvement, and any other participants in the government were rogues. \n\nSo the movie itself. OK, so it's pretty clear that the entire movie for me was extreme in its suggestions, so apart from that, I have to address the actual quality of the film. Well, I thought it had some good moments. The last hour, the courtroom, has a nice kinetic energy and delivers a very organised argument in a convincing manner. BUT, oh there it is... BUT the movie is a movie, not a documentary, so we are given characters. Trouble is, they aren't interesting. I couldn't care less about Jim Garrison's personal life (in fact, nor did Oliver Stone). So for the film's technical brilliance in editing and pacing, I applaud Oliver Stone in creating a film so controversial yet in no way exploitive or out-right ridiculous.

It's very rewatchable. \r\n \r\nAnyway, the story.\r\n\r\nJim Garrison (Kevin Costner), is the DA of New Orleans, and makes a case in the murder of John F. Kennedy. They find out that it may not have been Lee Harvey Oswald who pulled the trigger. Garrison has 12 assocites help him, in a case we already know they aren't going to win. Yet, Stone manages to make us root for them. \r\n \r\nAlright, the performances.\r\n \r\nThe whole film is filled with memorable faces. I think this is done, so that we could remember their character's names easier. Costner gives maybe his best performance here, somehow juggiling obbesion with determination, and we really don't know which one he is in the later scenes. \r\n \r\nOther key performances were Tommy Lee Jones, who played Clay Shaw, who Garrison believes helped assassinate Kennedy. Joe Pesci plays David Ferrie, another supposed conspirator. Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, and Donald Sutherland all give good supporting performances.\r\n \r\nBut I think the key supporting performance comes from Gary Oldman, who plays Lee Harvey Oswald. Oldman makes the character his own, and he isn't even seen in person, only in flashbacks, or newsreels. At the end, where Clay Shaw was on trial, I felt for Oswald almost, because it states he didn't know about the assassination, and then was blamed. \r\n \r\nIf you have any interest in John F. Kennedy or his assassination, watch JFK. Watch it.",

            "content": "In November, 1963, a monumentally horrendous event happened in Dallas, Texas. America's boy sweetheart President, the one who represented Camelot, was shot in the head. Ever since that fateful day in Dealy Plaza, there has been much ado about the events surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The Warren Commission, which was put together after the events, concluded that Oswald acted alone in his efforts to kill Kennedy. In spite of this, many people in this country have different feelings as to what went down in Dallas.\n\nThis film is largely a chronicle of one particular conspiracy theory that surrounds the death of President Kennedy, as well as the story about the one D.A. to bring a charge against someone for the death of JFK. The D.A., of course, is Jim Garrison, played by Kevin Costner. I'm not a huge fan of Costner as an actor, mainly because he's either really good or really bad in his roles. For every Field of Dreams and Dances With Wolves, there's a Waterworld or Wyatt Earp to destroy your image of him as an top-flight actor.\n\nLuckily, JFK is one of his better roles. He adopts a fairly good Yat accent for his role as a New Orleanian, and we really feel for the guy as he's on his almost obsessive crusade to find truth.\n\nAs stated previously, this film is about Garrison's attempt to make light of a dark and complicated subject. Just as broken up as the rest of America immediately after the assassination of the President, years later, he's tipped off to reopen a previously closed investigation of pilot David Ferrie (Pesci), an associate of Lee Harvey Oswald (Oldman) while Oswald was in New Orleans. During this time, Garrison flies to Washington DC with Sen. Russel Long (Matthau), who himself expresses doubts as to the validity and accuracy of the Warren Commission findings, which actually leads Garrison to read the entirety of the report himself. After reading the Warren Commission report and finding inaccuracies. His office then interviews various people connected with Ferrie, which eventually leads him to Clay \"Bertrand\" (Jones). \n\nOn another trip to DC, Garrison meets with X (Sutherland), a mysterious Air Force colonel who explains his belief that there is a grand conspiracy at various levels of government, crime (Mafia), and the overall military-industrial complex. This helps to further resolve Garrison to continue to his investigation, which leads to various consequences, including threats to his life and trouble at home with his wife (Spacek). \n\nEventually, Garrison gathers enough evidence to charge Clay Shaw for the murder of John F. Kennedy, as a part of a much larger conspiracy. During the trial, he goes to express outrage at the Warren Commission's belief in a single-bullet theory (proposed by current Republican US Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, then a lawyer for the Justice Department). In his closing remarks, Garrison concludes that there is evidence that the assassination of JFK was a coup d'tat, involving the highest levels of government.\n\nOne certainly cannot deny Oliver Stone's guts for making a movie surrounding this chain of events. He took a lot of heat, and continues to take a lot of heat, for making a movie about Jim Garrison's investigation into this particular conspiracy theory. I've heard people refer to this movie as one of the most haphazard, dangerous movie of all time, because the idea that someone would glorify Garrison for digging deep into this event following a conspiracy, no matter how false it may be, could be a traitorous act. I don't see it that way. At its time of release, there was actually talk of censoring parts of the film. While it's regrettable that due to this movie, many people reference this movie as being fact, I don't see anything wrong with giving Jim Garrison his side of the story.\n\nWith that having been said, there are aspects of this movie I didn't like. I found it extremely confusing to follow, in part due to the film-making. It seemed that this film was going 100 miles per hour, trying to jam every bit of information in that it possibly could. While there was certainly a lot surrounding this story, I thought it could have been better condensed and more understandable. \n\nThe acting in this film was first rate. Costner was fantastic as the in-over-his-head Jim Garrison. Tommy Lee Jones was also very good as Clay Shaw, the defendent in the JFK trial. Also of note is Joe Pesci's turn as David Ferrie, the man who eventually led Garrison to Bertrand/Shaw, and Donald Sutherland steals the screen in his very short segment as X.\n\nThis film has had a lasting cultural impact. While the merits of truth may not be there, this film did (and still does) help in getting society to ask questions of their government again. Government isn't always trustworthy, and we as a people need to do our part to keep it in check. I recommend this movie for anyone that enjoys a good conspiracy theory thriller, anyone willing to see a different side to the JFK story, or someone who just likes groundbreaking films.",

It may be fact or fiction, but Oliver Stone always makes a great film despite innaccuracies, because he cares more about making a entertaining movie with a universal point, that makes you think and draw your own conclusions, which is more than alot of other filmmakers can do.",

His character's closing argument is so beautifully acted (look for the moment when he looks into the camera) and so passionately written and delivered it packs an emotional wallop that will stay with you for days. Whether or not the information presented here is entirely factual is beside the point. Stone's genius here is capturing the national mood and an inherent emotional truth concerning the assassination of JFK: we couldn't possibly believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. We know there is a greater truth out there, and we the American people deserve to know the truth. We owe it to ourselves to question and probe until we get it. A great American classic",

I love conspiracy theories way more then the next guy, but a lot of this was pure speculation and fiction. I would be alright if it was presented as that, but the film is quite arrogant in it's depiction of what it thinks is fact that it becomes sickening. Kevin Costner is likable, I guess, save for a few of his sickly charming everyman moments. The film will divide viewers; those who believe the government is honest and could never be capable of killing their own president will dislike the film, while those who have a shred of belief in the fact that it could be possible for our government to stage such a conspiracy may like it. Stone is a different kind of director; he doesn't care who he offends, and he makes some of the most preposterous films, usually profiting off of American tragedies such as September 11th, this, and Vietnam; and I hate him for that. He also succeeds at creating fantastical representations of legendary figures, such as Presidents Nixon and Bush. I get what the message is; be scared of your government, because they can do more and cover up more than you think. But I think that's alright. I've reached a point in my conspiracy theory-filled world were I've begun to believe that cover-ups and black ops are necessary. When X (played by Donald Sutherland, probably the best character in the film) exposes all the facts to Garrison, about how the economy runs because of war and how we need war for industry to function and how JFK was wanted to change all of that... I was on X's side! Now, the whole point of the film is to say that change is good and what JFK was trying to accomplish was good and the CIA and such wanted to rub him out so they could return the US to status quo. I guess it's the conservative voice inside that's telling me that what happened here was good, and I'm listening to it. Other miscellaneous notes... the quality, in terms of conematography and style is excellent; the film is a prime example of how a film should be shot. The splicing of real footage, created fake footage, real scenes, and flashbacks was flawless. Also, when Garrison finds out Robert Kennedy was killed, he suddenly gets the urge to fuck his wife (WTF?). And finally, the Seinfeld magic loogie demonstration finally makes sense to me. All in all, it was a good film, but I don't necessarly agree with the message it's trying to send.",

Although a recent television documentary has shown it to be all but correct, the picture presents a technically sound and believable side to the JFK story. Kevin Costner is very impressive as Jim Garrison, fighting for what he truly believes in an obsessive pursuit of the truth. Flashbacks dominate the film, which is very well shot with excellent use of camera angles. These effects make Garrison's story all the more believable. The highlight of the film is the final scene, what it has all been building up to, the very climax. Garrison is bringing a court case against the homosexual aristocrat Clay Shaw, and the viewer cannot forsee the verdict until the very end.",

Taking the Vietnam War to frighteningly realistic levels (Platoon), satirizing modern stardom with cold blooded psychopaths (Natural Born Killers), and managing to make an entertaining film about stockbrokers (Wall Street), but taking one of the most controversial issues of the 20th century and creating an engrossing tale of a man's search for truth, and in it...justice.  JFK was not without it's de-riders, claiming it is a complete falsehood (even though every single thing he said was proven...but I digress), but I wholeheartedly disagree.  In my opinion (and Stone's himself)...JFK is his masterpiece.\n\nIn case the film's title doesn't give you a big enough hint, JFK follows New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison and his investigation into what he thinks was one of the biggest cover-ups in American history: the assassination of President John F. Kennedy...and who (or better yet, how many) killed him.  Staring an ensemble like no other, which includes Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, Jack Lemmon, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, etc. and they all are in top form in this mesmerizing drama.  \n\nApart from the great performances, the thing that really struck me was the editing and the cinematography.  Re-creating November 22. 1963 this perfectly must have been one of the most painstakingly tedious projects a director could undertake, but Stone does it with such finesse that you may start to think you are watching the History channel, and not a re-created set.\n\nEvery single frame of this film is passionately precise, every performance is noteworthy, everything...is...great.  While Stone has made some great films since 1991, I don't think he will ever surpass this masterwork.",

Its the chance that something so cunning and against the majority actually happened, entrances every part of us.  Its this idea that we've been bamboozled is what is so enticing. \"How could they have possibly done that? Is this true?\" Oliver Stone knows this and he puts it to use on one of the greatest and most jarring assassination in American history: JFK's assassination in Dallas. Stone creates a kinetic film that tries to reconstruct this conspiracy through the eyes of Jim Garrison, the district attorney of New Orleans who himself did try and bring this conspiracy to court. With the intercuts of archival footage and film footage, along with recreations, Stone drops into Dallas and asks to \"look closer\" and find our own truth. In this three hour opus, we are entrenched with Kevin Costner's Garrison, who is just like us, someone who is trying to find truth amongst what doesn't make sense, as well as trying to not let it consume him. With each minute we spend with Garrison, we start to believe his theory more and more, and soon as it engulfs him, its engulfs us as we need to know the truth. Soon, we're going mad and we start to see each kernel of truth as it begins to unfold in front of us and it all leads to a dramatic court room scene that has Costner giving one of the most stirring monologues I've heard on film. And then we realize that the film isn't about proving a theory right. Instead its about the right as an american citizen to question and dig at the burning questions that haunt our minds and souls. Of course there must be an advisory for this film: do not take every photo, every shred of evidence for fact. Much of the films points are based on some evidence, but don't let this be the brunt of your evidential weight. Instead realize that some of these things did happen, but they may be embellished to a degree inorder to create a fluid and moving story.",

Jim definately grows up at the end of this movie, but it feels more like a means than an end, and in truth the movie is about a man versus his lying, scheming, corrupt clusterfuck of a government. \r\nPeople seem to like saying Stone's a horrible director.

Powerful, persuasive film-making from Oliver Stone, JFK wants you to question what you've been told. Tackling the US government's handling of the Kennedy assassination, and the discrepancies, inaccuracies and outright fabrications in the Warren Report. Of course, this film is completely bias in it's viewpoint, but the evidence unearthed by New Orleans DA Jim Garrison is pretty overwhelming, and you are left with the feeling that Lee Harvey Oswald couldn't have acted alone. This is obviously a subject close to Stone's heart, and it shows from the finished film and screenplay. Combining real footage, reconstructions, news clips, and photographs into a unique mixture, JFK looks like nothing you've ever seen before. Add to that a truly superb performance from Kevin Costner, as well as every role, no matter how small, filled by a recognisable face (Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Jack Lemmon, Waltger Matthau). This helps keep track of proceedings actually, because so many characters are introduced over the course of the 3 hours+ of this film, so your doing well if you manage to follow everything. A masterpiece from Oliver Stone, powerful, provocative and controversial, while being constantly entertaining, while raising questions. So much more than just a film.",
