Weronika (Irene Jacob) is a Polish woman who strives to be a great singer. Veronique (also Jacob) is a Parisian who is also drawn to music and shares an existential angst with her Polish counterpart.  While the closest the two ever come to meeting is the shared experience of a violent protest in Krakow, they both understand intuitively that the other exists.  Director Krzysztof Kieslowski creates a mesmerizing, ethereal, somewhat surreal viewing experience that is as visually stunning as anything he (or anyone else, for that matter) has produced.  Throw logic out the window and allow the movie to wash over you as the two characters try to come terms with the fact that they are not alone in the world.",

Instead, existence is a tangle of invisible threads, linking people together in unexpected ways and implying an inherent 'unknowability' to the world around us. Dripping with a slow and dreamlike atmosphere (and a yellow tinge that makes you wonder if this is actually an American movie depicting Mexico), The Double Life of Véronique is consistently melancholy (depicting a series of characters that are tied closely, that indirectly benefit and suffer from each others' experiences, and that are destined never to meet), but shows a candid, romantic sensitivity that hints at deeper connections and a greater impact to our lives than perhaps we give ourselves credit for. \n\nKieślowski delivers the careful arrangement and attention to detail of a true auteur in this film, which is rightly considered an arthouse masterpiece, deliviering profound insights through beautiful visuals that require little in the way of studio cash or A-list acting name recognition. (4.5/5)",

            "content": "Wow, beautiful how the opening panning landscape shot is upside down, and during sunset. I don't think  I've seen a movie begin upside down. What a cute little girl. Now I see why the frame is upside down, the girl was looking out the window upside down. Wow the colors look amazing in this movie. The color palettes in this movie are incredibly beautiful. Wow this movie's so beautiful. The way it's shot gives it this almost dream-like quality tat is mesmerizing to watch. That kissing scene in the alley was hot lol. Really sweet and passionate. The actress who plays the main female character is very cute, very pretty. There's this very curious beauty about her, she's very lovely. \n\nThere was something so strangely familiar feeling and cozy about that scene with her and her Papa. And then the beautiful classical music in the background just elevates that scene even more. WTF?!? Her auntie's lawyer is a dwarf! Lol, I didn't see that coming. That was so delightfully surprising. Dude wtf?! She has a twin sister or something? Or a doppelgänger? Dude WTF?!?! What a fucking creep that older guy walking around town flashing his junk at Weronika. Lol wtf was that all about? That was so random. \n\nWow, that piece of music that she performs for the first time on stage with the orchestra was hauntingly beautiful. Ominous but beautiful. Wait… WHAT?! She's dead?! No way. I refuse to believe she's dead. That was so sudden and shocking. Wow, the most amazing performance she's ever given killed her. That's so fucking darkly tragic. She finally gets a shot at doing something she loves, something that's greater than her, and she fucking dies. At least she died doing what she was passionate about. \n\nI believe there's this sixth sense that we can all tap in to. I think this is what Veronique experienced right after having sex. The sadness that consumed her was the realization that a piece of her or in fact the other half of her has died. That marionette performance was dazzling to watch, so mesmerizing. It wasn't till the end that I realized the whole performance was a reflection of what had happened to Weronika. The marionette doll was a ballet dancer, died at the end doing what she loved and then was reborn as a butterfly. I wonder if the man who was puppeteering the marionettes is supposed to symbolize death, or a new beginning. There's all these ominous tones and omens throughout the movie. Like the shot of the graveyard right before she finds herself at her coworkers house. Reminds me of Don't Look Now in that regard. \n\nI feel like this coworker of her's that's getting her involved in the court case against Alexandre, the puppeteer and children's book author, is going to end up either getting her in trouble or getting her killed. I don't like it, and I don't like her one bit. If I were Veronique, I just wouldn't get involved. That whole cassette recording was trippy as hell. I don't know what to make of it. She puts her hand on the tree at her father's house and then cuts to her father milling and can sense that she's there. The last part of the movie kind of lost me, I found it disappointing. I think I was expecting a different ending. I guess I was expecting a more grounded and resolute ending - an answer. I should've known better since the whole movie is about asking question and intuition instead of answers. There's some things we cannot explain in life that are higher than our realm of senses and we just have to accept that. I was also expecting it become a thriller/horror movie similar to Brian De Palma. What the hell was I thinking?! Lmao. My only hope is that Veronique doesn't get serious with Alexandre.\n\nIncredibly dream-like and gorgeously filmed. Unexpectedly funny at times and mysteriously entrancing. Filled with beautiful symbolism. Truly unique and remarkable, unlike anything I've ever seen. All the green, yellow and orange lighting throughout the movie really gives it this almost surreal and dream-like quality to the film. At the same time, the movie unearths some very philosophical, spiritual and life-questioning questions. I'd like to watch it again sometime. Maybe I'll have a different outlook on the ending next time.",

            "content": "For me Kieslowski is one of the greatest, his films do not have the same analytical philosophising of the human condition of Bergman but they are greatly aesthetic, they are works of art. The Double Life... is a film about life, beauty and ultimately love. From the opening scenes of the little girls being shown the beauty of nature the whole thing becomes instantly a world of beauty and serene loveliness throughout. Right away we get the scenes of Weronika singing so beautifully and the rain starts to fall but instead of running for cover she continues and just feels and enjoys the feeling of rain on her face and straight afterwards becomes overwhelmed with love and passion in the darkened passageway, pure intensified life, love for life and this remained the theme for the whole film. We know its a film, we know they are actors, we know it's not really true and it doesn't matter if it could be or not, the question is not relevant, and none of it matters any more than knowing Mona Lisa was just sitting posing for a portrait, the art is still beautiful. The beauty of the singing, the fresh faced playfulness and happiness of youth, all the green mood lighting which one does not even consider in the context of reality, only as something aesthetically wonderful - not effected and shallowly showy like Blade Runner 2041. Kieslowski must have a lot of integrity as a filmaker. Kieslowski's films often have some higher, even spiritual, element to them and this is no exception but it doesn't matter at all that it isn't mentioned or explained in words, to do so would be to ruin it anyway. This is his first French film and I can see why he switched. His Polish films are also wonderful but they are harsher, harder, dirtier even and I believe this is because of the environment of Poland at the time (communism/post communism) and Kieslowski is not dishonest as a film maker. I assume he switched to French to make these smooth, soft aesthetic wonders for which he is so clearly suited. But not without a nod to reality - the death of Weronika, the flasher in the street, the car crash and removal of the burnt out vehicle. Although the film does not have the impact of a mainstream classic it is hard to know how to improve the film, it is more like the strong ocean undercurrents to the surface waves. So wonderful, so beautiful, cinema as art, fine art.",

            "content": "A few spoilery bits throughout!\n\nJust like a constellation you're unable to decipher yet sure its stars are linked together to form a certain pattern, the lives of Weronika and Véronique are inextricably, and inexplicably, linked by an invisible thread only intuitively felt. The former lives in Poland while the latter in France, they were born on the same day, share a knack for music (Weronika is a choir singer with an ethereal, angelic voice; Véronique is a music teacher), and suffer from a cardiological problem. They're, in a mythological sense of the word, doppelgängers, who'd better live in two parallel worlds lest bumping into each other would result in putting one another's lives into a tailspin. In one sense, the film is about that person in your dreams who you think, besides looking exactly like you, complements you in ways beyond your capacity even if you're sharing the same affinities as well. A splitting image you'd easily mistake for your other half even though you're pretty much a whole. Someone you long to meet to be fulfilled, and when awake, you grieve for the implausibility of it all. And I think it's within this realm where the movie operates on a subconscious level so that you're effortlessly connected emotionally with it by merely letting yourself immersed in its sepia-drenched images and its downpour to wash over you. However, I wouldn't buy that description at all. In another sense, it's a film about discovering one's own identity. Insofar this seems a proper description that I can't refute, I still think this is just scratching the surface; focusing on obvious details and disregarding the overarching theme. For me, The Double Life of Véronique is about grieving for your younger, juvenile self despite the naivety that led to its demise; about a deep-seated longing for the past that grows on while growing old even though you're more mature and successful now than you were way back when. And this is exactly where the film manages to hit some nostalgic notes, for the film seems to celebrate that desperate longing in one way or another. Besides the puppets show I'll mention later, there's a scene that sums up all this in a few words: Véronique's father shows her a fragrance to try it, she tells him it's nice but the one he showed her the other day was more pleasant. \"This is from the end of Autumn, the other was from the beginning,\" is her father's reply, which he follows by wondering whether people would need this fragrance at all. The movie is chockablock with subtle visual and narrative details carry multi-layered symbolic significance that I couldn't get my head around in my first watch.\n\nThe Double Life of Véronique is an enigmatic metaphysical tale with an expressionistic set design and cinematography littered with subtleties functioning as an objective correlative, stressing every emotional beat along the way. There's a lot of reflections in The Double Life of Véronique and the look-alike characters see themselves, or rather sense each other, in many things: images; objects. Throughout the first half, we see recurring distortions, upside-down images and mirror-like reflections, some show convexity and others concavity. We see plenty of objects such as a tram window glass, a man's magnifying spectacles, and a starry marble. They're all suggestive of something wrong rippling Weronika's life and irking her of late while bringing her fears of not being \"alone in this world\" to the fore. Besides, there are many juxtapository images the editing mix in that accentuate the dual nature at the core of the film. Indeed It's a film where objects and images hold immense value to the characters but also work as clues of revealing significance, and expository tools to the viewer as well. It's not until the marionette show where I started to fathom the film through the \"metamorphosis by death\" metaphor. The shroud is a cocoon? No wonder why there's a shot from the point of view of a corpse! Through this scene, Kieślowski makes a parallel to Véronique's double life, indicating that with the death of Weronika, Véronique began a fully-fledged new life. Moreover, by letting the camera linger on Jacob's face, Kieślowski captures the intensity of her internal conflict, and by ending the dizzying fits of Weronika with an off-kilter, tilted angle, we collapse with her. Thus, the camera is both a guiding force and a participant in Weronika's crumpling life and Veronique's quest of love and working out her existential issues. The Double Life of Véronique is just a flawless harmony or a poetic mood piece, buoyed by Idziak's ravishing cinematography, Preisner's haunting score, and sees Irène Jacob — in one of the most riveting performances I've ever seen to date — emoting endless feelings across the film's fleeting runtime, taking you on a rollercoaster of emotions from start to finish.",

I guess there really isn’t any clear indication of these aspects of the story, it’s just a mystery and I don’t deal well with that kind of abstraction. The film is very slow-moving and quiet. I almost wish it continued with the short stories like the first one and was The Quintuple Life of Veronique or something like that, because at least that would keep things moving a bit more. I was struggling to focus on the film because it was so quiet and peaceful that it threatened to lull me to sleep. I also don’t deal all that well with pointless sex and nudity in film, and there was plenty of that here. I wouldn’t say that The Double Life of Veronique is a bad film, or that it has nothing appealing in it, but the way it was put together did not work for me. Like I said, maybe I just don’t get it.",

The strength of the film lies in this omnipresent connection between the two women that look alike, feel each other's emotions and yet they have never met. Krzysztof Kie?lowski, that tragically passed away five years later, created this masterpiece that marked his career : a wise mix of poetry, whose plot oscillates between dream and reality. The silences, the palpable emotions, the almost-buried memories, the constant distress feed this synergy between the two women. The whole movie excels thanks to the puppets' play, a real metaphor of the connection between the women. The yellowish photography, sometimes flirting with a well-polished sepia, enhances the emotions and the actor's glances. \"The double life of Véronique\" is visually meticulous, sensitive and whose originality has lost none of its superbness since its released.\nFull review on our blog Los Indiscretos : https://losindiscretos.org",

            "content": "cinegeek.de  Our Daily Free Stream: Krzysztof Kieslowski - The Double Life Of Veronique (engl. subt.) Das ist ein Film über ein Gefühl und wie alle Gefühle, kann es nicht näher mit Worten beschrieben werden. Die Kunst aber kann es herauf beschwören. Es ist das Gefühl, dass wir nicht allein sind. Da gibt es noch jemanden anderes ausser uns. In einem entfernten Sinn sind wir miteinander verbunden durch Gedanken. Wir können das nicht begreifen, es ist ganz einfach ein Gefühl. Es existieren viele Theorien von Ereignissen, die andere Geschehnisse weit entfernt beeinflusst haben. Man hat Schimpansen auf einer Insel etwas beigebracht, während es die Schimpansen auf einer anderen Insel übernahmen. Zwei vibrierende Stränge an zwei verschiedenen Orten - synchron. Oder befinden sie sich an beiden Plätzen gleichzeitig? Krzysztof Kieslowskis La double vie de Véronique tut uns den Gefallen, sich selbst nicht zu erklären. Der Film lässt in der Schwebe, was gerade geschieht. Er beschwört es herauf. Er vollbringt das mit dem Gesicht von Irene Jacob. Sie spielt zwei Rollen, die polnische Veroniqua und die Französin Veronique. Kieslowski hat begriffen, dass das menschliche Gesicht das grösste Subjekt des Kinos ist. Seine Kamera betrachtet sehr intensiv das von Jacob. Ich möchte an dieser Stelle keine Zeit damit vergeuden, zu beschreiben, wie schön sie ist - denn Kieslowskis Kamera sucht nach der Seele dahinter. Manchmal lächelt sie, manchmal schaut sie verloren, manchmal denkt sie einfach nach. Sie selbst wirkt verletztlich, romantisch, voller Freude und zärtlich. Sie hat ein gutes Gesicht und wir werden mit einbezogen in ihre Selbstwahrnehmung. Der Film eröffnet mit einer lebenslustigen jungen Frau, Veroniqua, die nach Krakau reist, um ihre Tante zu besuchen. Ihre klare Stimme erweckt das Interesse eines Chorleiters. Sie wird ausgewählt, im Konzerthaus zu singen. Vor dem Auftritt erblickt sie sich selbst, wie sie in einen Reisebus steigt. Wie angewurzelt bleibt Veroniqua stehen, erstarrt vor Schmerz. Die andere Frau, die so aussieht wie Veroniqua, bemerkt sie nicht und macht Schnappschüsse mit ihrem Fotoapparat. Ohne es zu realisieren, fotografiert die Fremde Veroniqua. In Paris treffen wir Veronique, eine Lehrerin. Mit ihrer Klasse besucht sie ein Marionetten-Theater. Durch einen Spiegel hinter der Bühne, kann sie den Puppenspieler sehen und er sie. Sie sei verliebt, verkündet sie kurz darauf. Ihr Vater fragt, ob sie traurig sei und sie bejaht das (obwohl sie nicht genau weiss, weshalb). Ich denke, wir kennen den Grund: So etwas wie eine Erregung der Zeit muss von Krakau nach Paris gedrungen sein. Veronique und der Puppenspieler Alexandre (Philippe Volter) sind miteinander verbunden. Sie findet ihn und flieht vor ihm, sie hat sich auf die Liebe eingelassen. Später wird sie Alexandre erzählen, dass sie schon ihr ganzes Leben lang fühlt, sie befinde sich an zwei Orten gleichzeitig. Wir kennen das Gefühl. Angenommen, du befindest dich in einer fremden Stadt und sitzt in einem Cafe. Auf einmal glaubst du, genau diese Situation schon einmal erlebt zu haben (obwohl du vorher nie dort warst). Alexandre hat zwei Marionetten geschnitzt, die Veronique gleichen. Er trägt die Geschichte der Beiden vor: Als sie noch klein war, hat die eine Puppe den heissen Ofen berührt. Wenige Tage später wusste die andere, dass diese Berührung schmerzhaft sei und unterlässt es. Warum hört die Pariser Veronique plötzlich und unvermittelt auf, Gesangs-Stunden zu nehmen? Ein \"normaler\" Film Marke Arthaus hätte uns das genau erklärt. Kieslowski zum Glück nicht. Er will gar nicht wissen, wie solche Dinge gestehen. Er möchte, dass wir uns eingestehen, wie sich so etwas anfühlt. Sollte nun der falsche Eindruck entstanden sein, in La double vie de Véronique gebe es kaum Handlung? Der Film hat eine hypnotische Wirkung, wir werden hinein gezogen in die Charaktere, ohne den Abstand, den uns ein Plot erlauben würde. Beide Frauen, Veroniqua und Veronique, sind gut und echt. Sie tun nichts, dessen sie sich schämen müssten. Es gibt da diesen Moment, in dem Jacobs Veronique ihr Gesicht in die Sonne hält. Wir spüren; sie lebt diesen Moment, sie geniesst ihn! Es ist einer der schönsten Filme, die ich je sah! Der Kameramann Slawomir Idziak offenbart die glühende Schönheit Jacobs! Eine ganze Palette an Rot- und Grüntönen, die an sich für Nichts stehen, aber den Film so wundervoll, so verzaubert aussehen lassen! Sie unterstreichen die dritte auffällige Farbe: Ein goldenes Gelb und das betont Jacobs makelloses Gesicht. Es gibt einige weitere Charaktere, zwei Väter, eine Tante, einen Gesangslehrer und alle betrachten sie mit Liebe und Weisheit. Der Film kennt keine bösen Menschen. Es gibt auch mysteriöse Gestalten, wie die Frau mit dem schwarzen Hut. Sie dreht sich um und blickt Veronique hinterher. Wer sie ist; wir erfahren es nicht. Das ist die Kunst Krzysztof Kieslowskis, der ein wundervoller Regisseur ist! Gemeinsam mit seinem Autoren Krzysztof Piesiewicz hat er manche Erkundungen des menschlichen Schicksals angestellt. La double vie de Véronique wirkt wie eine einzige filmische Umarmung. Eine, die man mit einem guten Freund teilt, den man liebt - etwas, was euch beiden sehr wichtig ist! dazu gibts die für schönsten mystischen Film in unserer Film List auf cinegeek.de",

            "content": "A beautiful puzzler from Kieslowski (after his Decalogue but before his Three Colours trilogy) that places radiant Irene Jacob into two roles (Weronika and Veronique) - but even she isn't fully aware that both exist.  The movie begins in Poland where Weronika is a classical singer who, although untrained, wins a prestigious position in a concert.  She has a boyfriend, a funny aunt, and a caring dad.  One day, she catches a glimpse of her doppelganger on a tourist bus.  Later we transition to Paris and follow Veronique, a schoolteacher, who feels that she has always been two places at once.  She abruptly decides no longer to pursue singing (probably a good idea). She receives messages from a mysterious presumed suitor.  She figures out the puzzle and her mysterious suitor fashions two marionettes in her likeness.  The movie concludes.  So, what is Kieslowski's message?  Perhaps it is difficult to ferret but the themes swirl all about:  the commonalities in human experience, the role of mysterious and maybe miraculous coincidences, the controlling hand of fate in our lives, probably more.  All told,  these slices of lives are delicious, even if they have no point (or we are left only to speculate with no concrete evidence of the points).",

            "content": "This film presents a unique, but rather confusing concept. The film revolves around two women who lead separate lives, have no immediate connection with other, are not related to each other, but not only are they physically identical, but somehow they have an emotional bond that transcends all physical boundaries, and they also appear to meet their end in the same way. In all honesty, that premise doesn't make any sense at all, but does allow for some distractingly beautiful film-making. As for the film's two main characters, the dual roles are played rather convincingly by the film's lead actress Irène Jacob, who drifts through the two roles like feathers caught in the wind. Her performances of the two characters almost mirror each other, although the script offers some slight differences between the two. Despite this being a foreign-language film, I felt I could get quite engrossed in the film's atmosphere, mainly because the film illustrates a kind of poetic communication that, I must admit, is pretty much impossible for me to describe in a way that doesn't make me sound like a gibbering lunatic. It's a beautiful film in terms of both visuals and acting, but I find that the film is hampered by a directionless plot. It relies very heavily on the presence of its main protagonist, but it leaves behind a major paradox that it doesn't even try to resolve, despite there being ample time in which to resolve it. Thankfully, this is the kind of film that emphasizes on atmosphere and immersion rather than plot. If the film lacked any semblance of atmosphere, then it would have been a masterstroke in the fine art of boredom. On the topic of atmosphere, the film does a brilliant job at presenting and conveying atmosphere, and as I could mention several times by now, the film's mesmerizing atmosphere is its biggest strength because it distracts the viewer from a muddled plot. The film's fixation on music is something else to consider. Both the main characters are involved in music in some way (one a choir soprano and the other a music teacher), and the film makes heavy use of a haunting orchestral score. To be honest though, the film feels more to me like a painting than a film. That said, however, the film-makers seem to be aiming for the same kind of delicacy in their film-making technique as would be called for in the context of fine art painting. That's certainly the impression I get from the film's subtle blend of colours. Despite its flaws, I find that this film can and should be taken as a film of many interconnected characteristics. The story will most likely raise more questions that the director was inclined to answer, but it offers a rewarding package of fragility, beauty, intimacy and mystery within the frame of a subjective narrative. If you're not thinking about where every little detail fits, you'll probably be immersed in the vivid and often mystical trip the film seems to offer.",

            "content": "The Criterion DVD for The Double Life of Veronique includes many of the bells and whistles when it comes to special features, not to mention a long, in-depth interview with the director, Kieslowski.  Maybe I'll watch that some time soon, but not right after watching this film.  I could go looking for some easy answers - if there are any, which I doubt anyway - but I'd rather stay for now in a moment where I can just ponder everything I watched.  It's such a rich and moving experience, and is one of the most unique mystery films I've seen in a very long time - possibly ever.\n\nIn a way its chief mystery is what it's all about, which remains, possibly, elusive even to the end.  Of course we have an idea of the concrete fact that there were two babies born on the same day in different countries, France and Poland, and they grew up to be beautiful young women with dark hair and brown eyes, and looked exactly the same.  There's also a moment where the two see each other (one sees the other on a tour bus in Krakow, this in the midst of a protest/riot in the streets, and yet this other woman on the bus won't see her, at least not yet).  Will they try to look for one another is a key question.\n\nBut Kieslowski is so not interested in anything conventional here.  The mystery is about discovering things, but not necessarily the deeper mystery of one knowing for sure the other exists; in other words, this isn't one of those double movies like, say, The Double (2014).  We really get two stories here of these women, and they're full-on character portraits: the first half hour is dedicated to Weronique, the Polish woman, who is a professional singer (and former piano player) who has a heart condition.  The rest of the film focuses on Veronique, who is a music teacher and, after seeing a puppet show performed by a charismatic man named Antoine (or is it Alexandre, one of those), he starts to... stalk her?  Follow her in an intriguing way?  Certainly he leaves clues for her to find, and when she does... then what?  \n\nI'd like to make note for a moment music in the film.  I don't think it's some flippant \"artsy\" choice on the filmmaker's part that each of these people are involved with music.  Music is so central to the film, especially when Weronique is singing and becomes her most vulnerable, but also in those moments (on the flip-side image, so to speak) where Veronique isn't paying as close attention to the music she's teaching her students.  Notice the opera that Weronique sings comes back more than once, like when Veronique is watching the marionette show.  There is some significance there, and it may be rooted back into that realm that music can lie with every person - like a romance, which this film has, you can't always use the utmost logic ('the heart wants what it wants' so to speak) so why a music moves one person won't necessarily be the same for another.  Why is music so paramount for Weronique, while for Veronique it doesn't seem so?  Or, is music one of the things that connects them in that elusive, deep-deep down inside sense that they both have?  Or maybe they're latent Jedis or something (I kid).\n\nHow this is all filmed is completely absorbing; Kieslowski uses hand-held camerawork, but in a steady way that often creates tension, like when the two Veroniques are walking out in public (i.e., French side after she leaves her rendezvous with this not-so-mystery man and tries to go through crowded streets, and the Polish side after a rehearsal, where her heart becomes weak and she stumbles to catch her breath).  How he uses color is especially breathtaking as well, and not always in ways that forces it but suggests things - red filters and bright whites and yellows here and there (not as blatant as the Colors trilogy, but maybe this was a practice round).  So even when things get so enigmatic that it could, in just a few moments, become pretentious, Kieslowski reels it back in and makes the direction vital and important in ways that are unexpected.  The camera itself is often another character, which is impressive.\n\nI've come all this way and haven't noted that without Irene Jacob this might all not work, or at least as well.  There may be a moment here and there where it doesn't seem like she's doing much - she's so beautiful (on the cover I thought for a moment it was Ingrid Bergman with her eyes closed) that one might underestimate how deep and powerful she gets into both these women.  The vulnerability is what's so staggering, and how much she feels the moments of joy and wonder, how her face registers genuine curiosity and in seeking out this mystery, and that crucial scene at the cafe when this Frenchman is revealed, notice how her face changes - it's subtle, but it's really there.  I could watch Irene Jacob in this film or Red and see an actress so in tune with the character(s) that she in a way does half the work for Kieslowski.  In other words, even when I was wondering, more than once, 'this storyline, such as it is, is getting a little weird and quixotic, maybe for its own good', she really grounded me in the emotional logic, and the pathos becomes so much that it makes something like a scene near the end this mix of heartbreak and bewilderment that I've rarely seen like this in a film.\n\nI hope to revisit this film again, and again.  It's confounding, but never in ways that might alienate; Kieslowski asks the audience 'come, a little closer - find out more about these women, and whatever the outcome, the journey is genuine and interesting.'",

            "content": "There's an ethereal profundity infused in nearly every green, crimson, and golden frame. Kieslowski enraptures with sensual flourishes and swirling filtration. The images are often striking; the camera swishing over Veronique as she twirls gleefully from her bed... Rain cascading over Weronika as she sings alone in the open air... Veronique listening in hushed anticipation to a near-silent phone call as neons and incandescents bathe her face... It's like a dream.\n\nIrene Jacob inhabits her character(s) with a smooth, authentic gentility. She seems to feel every moment as if it were her own.\n\nThe story is nearly as oblique as the numerous reflections, distortions, and visual abstractions through which we regard the landscape of the film, and yet I felt a sort of tacit kinship with its dreamy quality. It calls to mind Andrei Tarkovsky, or David Lynch in his airier moments. The film's brief, lilting coda encapsulates this tone beautifully. Narratively, it's beyond rationality, and yet it's delivered with an inexplicable knowingness that transcends petty notions of narrative clarity.\n\nMy only real criticisms are, for one, that Kieslowski overdoes it occasionally with the garish green filters, which can obscure and distract from otherwise beautiful imagery. A couple of interstitial sequences are a bit overlong, which made me mildly restless. Nevertheless, The Double Life of Veronique is a gentle, quietly powerful film made with care and subtlety.",

Irene Jacob plays two phenomenal and different roles. I loved the rapturous first part with Weronika but it's the second part, with Veronique, that becomes more opaque and troublesome. Kieslowki has crafted a fine film, one whose meaning may allude, but whose deep truths can be felt. It's also enjoyable to pull apart, dissect, and attempt to solve this puzzle of a movie.

Jacob's central performance, the target of such cinematic voyeurism, is also excellent. \r\n\r\nSadly, by the time the film's over it seems that Kieslowski should have had loads more to say; the film feels incomplete or like a half-baked meditation of some amusing ideas that should've been developed more. Even with the average running time of 98 minutes I felt that the film was in two large awkward chunks with each act dedicated to the two main characters. I wouldn't have minded if the film carried on, in the imaginary third act begging to manifest, to make a more concrete statement with its pleasantly whimsical and very intriguing premise.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of the 'Three Colors Trilogy,' which stretched the ideas of the boundless interconnectivity of our lives to such a momentous degree that 'La Double Vie de Véronique' seems like a cheap knock-off, I was severely disappointed.",

The Double Life of Veronique is a haunting musical epiphany and with such visual poetry, it is filled with symbolism, some frank eroticism, and a slight dark humor. Kieslowski loves to filter colors to have an effect on his films, if it was part of his Three Colors Trilogy, it would've been \"Gold\". The photography was nostalgic, the lighting gives different shades on different moods of the characters. Irene Jacobs was enigmatic and sensual in her role as Weronika and Veronique. The story is simple, but there is more than the plot here, Kieslowski is more concerned in the visual rhyme, and his mystical narration of the story. He kind of connect the whole film together with strings but still leaves it like a scattered puzzle, it encourages uncertainty, and that is what I really liked about it. It leaves us with haunting questions that remains for us to answer, maybe in our own lives, rather than making us a complacent viewer that understands everything about the film and the world. I admire how Kieslowski made the film a reflection on the possibilities that the film indicates a reality beyond physical mundane lives. This film is both delicate and mysterious.

            "content": "Fresh from a blockbuster overload after watching \"The Dark Knight Rises\" a couple of times, it's a bit off for me to immediately jump back to my more esoteric inclinations. Now, here's Krzysztof Kieslowski's enigmatic \"The Double Life of Veronique\", a film that, like the movements of the marionettes shown in the film, unveils its story with a certain hypnotic vibe. Honestly, I'm not quite sure if what I have seen is really something deeply meditative or merely a pretentious piece, but it is nonetheless an artful ride. \n     \nJust like a typical Kieslowski film, \"The Double Life of Veronique\" appears as if little to nothing is going to happen and as if the main characters' feelings are operating within the confines of an emotional plane alien to ordinary viewers like us. But with the Kieslowki's usual sleight-of-hand at play here, and with that I mean his penchant for integrating deeply affecting concepts about love and identity within the visual limitations of a subtle drama film, \"The Double Life of Veronique\" is quite successful in a handful of levels. \n     \nFirst, it is a well-crafted cinematic amalgamation of music and imagery (thanks to Kieslowski's frequent collaborators Zbigniew Preisner and Slawomir Idziak). Second, it is a film particularly memorable because of Irene Jacob's natural, iridescent charm and quietly devastating performance. And third, well, this is where the more ambiguous things come in. As an abstract film both in emotions and meaning, it is meritorious in just letting its own visual and auditory mood take over the reins of telling the film's story (or the reins of justifying the lack thereof). But unlike your usually plotless art film, \"The Double Life of Veronique\" has an involving narrative working to its own advantage. \n     \nWell, the story is quite simplistic. It concerns two women who look very much alike: Weronika, who lives in Poland, and Veronique, who lives in Paris. Both characters are played by Irene Jacob. From the hair to their dressing preference, they are the spitting images of one another. Hell, they're not even related. \n     \nNot aware of each other's existence, the film's metaphysical powers are slowly creating a bridge; slowly, we are seeing the connection between them. But Kieslowski, arguably at his subtlest, won't let his film be tarnished by some clichéd chance encounters or life-affirming vis a vis between the two. Instead, Kieslowski has spatially set both characters apart from each other to first let their independent stories be told. Weronika, a considerably free-spirited young woman, is just inches away from attaining success in the world of opera singing. Veronique, on the other hand, is a music teacher in search of a meaningful love. From these simple stories of existence, the film is quite surprising in how it slowly widens its conceptual plane as it progresses. From simply being a drama film about two look-alikes, \"The Double Life of Veronique\" slowly turns into a meditation about distant duality and the spiritual and emotional connection between two people created in the same physical mould.\n     \nSo, maybe this is where God enters this little humanist circus. Does Kieslowski perceive God as a playful master creator? An omniscient being that brings dead ringers into existence, intentionally integrates them into the stream of life and then watch the sparks fly? Is there some sort of energy that these two share that when one of them dies, the other gets weaker and emptier inside? Kieslowski's vision for this picture is just too far-reaching and, at the same time, so wonderfully ambiguous that its idea just won't end where this film already has. Take \"Another Earth\" as an ideal example. I believe that the said film is \"The Double Life of Veronique\" all over again. \n     \nAdding a sci-fi element by incorporating a 'mirror' earth that is said to be inhabited by parallel versions of ourselves, \"Another Earth\" just took this film's whole concept and made it a notch more complicated but a notch less fascinating. But do not get me wrong, I think that \"Another Earth\", as a film, has its own merits. But at the end of the day, I very much prefer Kieslowski's masterly stroke of using nothing as his ultimate explanation to everything. Though this might be considered as a pretentious cop-out on his part, leaving everything unanswered has made the film even more compelling and reflective than it should have been. Although we all have different takes on it, we do not hold the key to what it's really all about. Perhaps life itself does, and we just aren't looking closely.",

This movie doesn't make any sense, but it's also clearly not trying to. It's very beautiful and assured, and also so artsy it almost hurts at times.\n\nThe title is a little misleading - Veronique doesn't actually have a double life the way, say, Batman does. There are actually two of her - a Polish singer named Weronika, and a French music teacher named Veronique (both are played by Irene Jacob and look exactly the same). They don't know each other, though they do almost cross paths early on in the movie. We see some of Weronika's life, and then we abruptly shift to Veronique's life. \n\nIrene Jacob, who won the Cannes best actress award for this movie in 1991, has to carry what drama the movie has as Weronika/Veronique. It reminded me of an Ingmar Bergman movie, because we spend so much time just watching various emotions play across her face. The psychology of both characters is pretty much impenetrable. Jacob does a great job, but the movie keeps her at a distance from the audience that we don't normally expect.\n\nVisually and aurally, this is quite a movie. It's also almost preposterously artsy. There's a marionette show like the ones in Being John Malkovich, except this movie isn't making fun of it. The cinematography by Slawomir Idziak is some of the best, or at least the most inflected, I've ever seen; practically everything is bathed in this lush, moody green light, or in red or yellow sometimes. That this movie was made before digital color correction is amazing; the Criterion Collection DVD I saw it on does a great job preserving the look of the movie. There's a ton of opera music. The direction and editing do a great job evoking the main characters' subjectivity, even though we never seem to actually get into her head. I have no idea what this movie means, or if it really even means anything, but whatever it is it's doing, it certainly does it well.",

Director Krzysztof Kieslowski is better recognised for his acclaimed Three Colours films, in which human psychology is explored via a series of dramatic life-altering events, but before this he was already exploring similar themes and The Double Life of Veronique places the notion of duality under his unique filmmaking microscope. \nThe events of the film are presented through the eyes of two young women, each living on different sides of Europe. In Poland, we meet a talented young singer named Veronica (Irene Jacob) who travels to Krakow to visit her aunt and while there, her beautiful voice is noticed by a choir director and is subsequently chosen to sing at a concert. Walking around town, Veronica is astonished to see a woman on a bus whose appearance is identical to her, but unfortunately this woman is too busy taking photos to notice Veronica. This unusual introduction presents the filmâ(TM)s other protagonist, a French schoolteacher named Veronique. While watching a marionette performance with her students in Paris, Veronique seemingly falls in love with a puppeteer but the veracity of her feelings seem uncertain as this new love brings her a mystifying sadness. The puppeteer Alexandre (Philippe Volter) lavishes her with gifts and tape recordings and after a series of emotional denials she eventually admits her love for him, her confusing behaviour explained by her metaphoric and outwardly literal claim of â~â(TM)all my life Iâ(TM)ve felt I was in two places at the same timeâ(TM)â(TM). As the film progresses there is both tragedy and celebration, culminating with one of Krzysztof KieÅ>lowskiâ(TM)s trademark moving yet ambiguous conclusions. \nThe Double Life of Veronique explores the long-held belief that somewhere on earth we all have a â~doppelgangerâ(TM), another person who is physically identical to us. The doubling of a single person (such as that of Veronique) causes us to consider the true definition of individual identity. If there are two copies of a person, what distinguishes one from the other and can they ever really be considered unique? Does physical appearance reflect individuality or is it only present in the consciousness of our mind?

            "content": "The Double Life of Veronique is a fascinating film which questions our understanding of free-will and self-identity. Director Krzysztof Kieslowski is better recognised for his acclaimed Three Colours films, in which human psychology is explored via a series of dramatic life-altering events, but before this he was already exploring similar themes and The Double Life of Veronique places the notion of duality under his unique filmmaking microscope. \nThe events of the film are presented through the eyes of two young women, each living on different sides of Europe. In Poland, we meet a talented young singer named Veronica (Irene Jacob) who travels to Krakow to visit her aunt and while there, her beautiful voice is noticed by a choir director and is subsequently chosen to sing at a concert. Walking around town, Veronica is astonished to see a woman on a bus whose appearance is identical to her, but unfortunately this woman is too busy taking photos to notice Veronica. This unusual introduction presents the filmâ(TM)s other protagonist, a French schoolteacher named Veronique. While watching a marionette performance with her students in Paris, Veronique seemingly falls in love with a puppeteer but the veracity of her feelings seem uncertain as this new love brings her a mystifying sadness. The puppeteer Alexandre (Philippe Volter) lavishes her with gifts and tape recordings and after a series of emotional denials she eventually admits her love for him, her confusing behaviour explained by her metaphoric and outwardly literal claim of â~â(TM)all my life Iâ(TM)ve felt I was in two places at the same timeâ(TM)â(TM). As the film progresses there is both tragedy and celebration, culminating with one of Krzysztof KieÅ>lowskiâ(TM)s trademark moving yet ambiguous conclusions. \nThe Double Life of Veronique explores the long-held belief that somewhere on earth we all have a â~doppelgangerâ(TM), another person who is physically identical to us. The doubling of a single person (such as that of Veronique) causes us to consider the true definition of individual identity. If there are two copies of a person, what distinguishes one from the other and can they ever really be considered unique? Does physical appearance reflect individuality or is it only present in the consciousness of our mind?

            "content": "Because the director of this film does not want people to spell his name correctly, I am going to refer to him throughout the review as \"Kris K,\" like I always do. On that note:\r\n\r\nKris K is perhaps the most visually talented of filmmakers; it is his experimentation with themes of color that really set him apart. \"The Double Life of Veronique\" reveals that it is a Kris K film right off the bat, reminding us that the beautiful and special quality of his work is what makes it so instantly recognizable as his.\r\n\r\n\"The Double Life of Veronique\" is not, as I believed it would be before I viewed it, a movie about a woman with an alter ego; one who leads two lives. It is, in fact, about two women who are played by the same great and gorgeous actress, Irene Jacob. Weronika and Veronique are two remarkably physically similar women who have never met and yet share an odd emotional bond. One has a beautiful voice; the other is a teacher of music. I should add that this is one of those movies that is quite hard to explain when it comes to plot; it simply needs to be seen to be understood, and perhaps seen more than once.\r\n\r\nPerhaps on my second viewing I may like it less, but all I know now upon seeing it for the first time, is that it was one of the most gorgeous movies ever to pass before my eyes. Plot, acting, script, filming, cinematography, all of it is top-notch, but that really doesn't even seem important after you've watched the film. For the best context and the best understanding, one should consider the director's other achievements, although it really isn't needed to merely acknowledge this as a great film.\r\n\r\n\"The Double Life of Veronique\" is a masterful example of Kris K's skill in weaving a story and an ever-present theme through the use of color. In the film \"Fat Girl,\" green and red are often used to distinguish between two central characters, revealing their differences and the themes they may represent; in this film, which came out before \"Fat Girl,\" it should be noted, Kris K's eye for color shines through in many different variations. \r\n\r\nVeronique's two \"lives\" are represented and portrayed through many different colors; red, green, and yellow, primarily, bringing the audience back to K's other adventures into the use of color as cinematographic art, the closest being his \"Three Colors\" trilogy, where the themes of color are separated into three different films corresponding to the three colors on the French flag: Red, White, and Blue. The films are not necessarily patriotic statements, though; they all contain stories of love and loss and very subtle care for the nation of France. \"The Double Life of Veronique\" is a more unified example of Kris K's talented eye for color, and led by a fantastic performance from Irene Jacob. \r\n\r\nLike Jeremy Irons in \"Dead Ringers,\" Jacob plays two characters who are connected in that they are virtually the same person (I should add that in \"Dead Ringers,\" Irons plays two identical separated Siamese twins) but she gives each side emotional depth and uniqueness.\r\n\r\nKris K loves to makes films that fit together and represent something as a whole. The ten episodes of \"The Decalogue\" each represent one of the ten commandments, and of course then there's the color trilogy. \"The Double Life of Veronique,\" however, stands alone as a simplified and united work. Like K's other film collectives, it is made of several \"parts,\" but these parts are not \"chapters,\" per-say; they are \"pieces\" that, when fit together, achieve their full meaning. Rather than splitting this film into ten parts, each symbolic of one of the commandments or one of the colors on the French flag, K has wisely chosen to keep his film simple on the surface, but beautifully complex underneath. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"The Double Life of Veronique\" is a visually stunning work of art that explores many themes of the depths of emotions and human connections. It makes the viewer appreciate the art of film, yet manages to keep everything subtle and consistent.\r\n\r\n9.9",

Kieslowski is exploring the basic idea of the Counterpart Theory in Metaphysics. If you can grasp that theory and understand the long standing 'double' troupes (they range from Dostoyevsky's famous story 'The Double' to as recently as \"Another Earth\") you will begin to unlock the film. On the surface Irene Jacob is terrific and the cinematography is incredible (all those colors!). \"The Double Life of Veronique\" is a wonderful and complex experience that is immensely rewarding to committed viewers but beware that the film will be extremely confounding if merely 'watched.'\n\nAlso, many people think the film is not 'meant to be figured out.'

It raises questions about fate, love, and that strive for artistic perfection. It doesn't contain a straight forward plot by any means. It's completely surreal storytelling that could only make sense on film. The visuals tell the story and the dialogue contains it. It's almost Malickian in how it tells the story, only with more structure.  It was a metaphor bursting off of every scene and in many ways it baffled me to what it was trying to convey. Even without grasping the metaphors in the poetic cinematography you can appreciate how beautiful and graceful it tells these two stories.\n\nIrene Jacob is stunning. I have never seen her in anything else, but she was absolutely mesmerizing. She brings grace and charm to the screen. She was extremely well deserving of the best actress at Cannes. \n\nThe way you need to watch this film is to allow it to wash over you because it is such a warm fairytale-esque movie that will simply mesmerize you from start to finish. Since it is such a fairy tale type story I didn't buy into a lot of the plot devices, and while I don't think you are supposed to buy into everything from a logical standpoint.

The film itself is one with its character, and both embody a remarkable spontaneity and utter beauty.  Both are also sensitive to the world, equally moved by small moments and materials and defined by them; the result a deep, complicated interior.  At this point, even I am a bit lost.  Don't expect Veronique to make perfect sense, either.  But if you are one of these people who crumbles at great art and rich storytelling, prepare to be nailed with one of the finest, and perhaps most profound film experiences you can find.",

Made by Krzysztof Kieslowski, who's perhaps more known for his Three Colours Trilogy, this is his masterpiece.  I would have given it twice as many stars if I could!",

The way you might not like the large amount of symbolism in The Double Life of Veronique, vague or obviously difficult to impossible to get all of it, is otherwise the way I get an enlightenment of seeing them as a great way to make us feel, touched and memorize. Sensing them in unity which blend with emotions.\n\nThe most beautiful film I've ever seen, so far. Thanks Kieslowski.",
