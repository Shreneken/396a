The film is directed by James Cameron and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Edward Furlong. It is the perfect sequel to the original Terminator film, and in many ways, surpasses it.\n\nOne of the things that makes this film so great is the incredible special effects. The T-1000, played brilliantly by Robert Patrick, is a liquid metal terminator that can morph into any shape it desires. The visual effects used to bring this character to life are truly groundbreaking, and still hold up even today.",

            "content": "Terminator 2: Judgment Day is not only one of the greatest sequels ever made but one of the greatest movies of all time. Released in 1991, directed by James Cameron, and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Edward Furlong, it is a masterpiece of science fiction and action that has stood the test of time.\n\nThe film is set in a future where machines have taken over the world and are trying to wipe out the remaining human resistance. In a desperate attempt to change the future, a reprogrammed Terminator model-101 (Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time to protect John Connor (Furlong), the future leader of the human resistance, from an advanced Terminator model T-1000 (Robert Patrick) sent to kill him and is almost infinitely more complex than the Terminator model-101. The T-1000 has the ability to imitate any human it touches, which makes it a way more formidable opponent giving the viewer a constant feeling of \"Is that who we think it is?\". This one aspect alone makes way for some groundbreaking storytelling and situations. Especially for the time it was released.\n\nTerminator 2 is a perfect blend of action, suspense, and character development. The special effects, especially for their time, were amazing and still hold up well today! But what really sets this movie apart is its emotional depth. The relationship between John and the Terminator is a highlight of the film, as the machine learns to understand and care for humanity. The performances by Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, and Furlong are exceptional, adding depth and nuance to their characters.\n\nThe movie's themes are timeless and universal, exploring the nature of humanity, sacrifice, and the consequences of our actions. It is a thrilling and intense ride that never lets up, with some of the most iconic and memorable scenes in movie history, such as the chase on the freeway and the final showdown in the factory.\n\nIn conclusion, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves its place in the pantheon of great movies. It's not just a great sequel but a great movie, period. It has everything you could ask for in a film - action, suspense, emotional depth, and memorable characters. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it as soon as possible!",

There are very few 90's action movies and rated \"R\" movies that I'll ever watch, but this movie does both of those things correctly. With a story that's perfectly made and follows the events from the first movie and turns the T-800 into the hero instead of the villain, visuals that may be outdated today, but still gives me the heebie-jeebies whenever I see the T-1000, and characters that make the story even better to relate to (especially with the role of John Conner in this movie), I think that this has to be not only the best Terminator movie ever made, but as a stand-alone movie, it still works great! Story: 10/10, Visuals: 9/10, Characters: 10/10, My overall opinion: 10/10\n\nSpeed run for all other Terminator movies after 2:\n\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines: Completely pointless, 5/10\nTerminator: Salvation: Boring...worst of the franchise, 4/10\nTerminator: Genisys: Stupid, but guilty pleasure fun movie, 7/10\nTerminator: Dark Fate: Woke concept, but best one since T2, 8/10",

This film will always hold a special place in my life. I will never get tired of it ever. What a masterpiece and the fact that it still holds up after over 30 years shows it's a timeless film.

Whilst the effects are obviously with that nineties style, with rear projection and early CGI, they are still incredibly impressive and have that tangible reality to them that elevates them beyond modern CGI-only effects. The sound design is also excellent, memorable and pretty-much faultless. The writing is fantastic and this is what, combined with the groundbreaking effects, elevates this to be a truly timeless classic. The acting and characters contribute to the story and effects. It's not one aspect that is good, it is all aspects of this film. I even like the 3D conversion they did, it gave us another way to watching this classic. The story really builds on the first film. The action is exciting. The pacing perfect. Shame James Cameron's newer films are not as good, along with Aliens (1986) this is the peak of his career in my opinion. It's an awesome action film, the likes of which only come many years apart. Everything about it is totally kickass brilliant.",

The special effects still look decent and the action is quite compelling.  There are bone chilling moments during this movie, especially seeing a nuclear bomb drop on Los Angeles, and seeing LA as a pile of ash and rubble at the start.  Linda Hamilton did an amazing job playing the emotions of her disturbed character.  I believed both her anger and sorrow.  Robert Patrick is amazing as the T1000, and it also makes me laugh how much both his voice and look remind me of Charlie Sheen.  It was fun to revisit this one.

            "content": "The original Terminator film is one of the greatest films of the action genre, and still holds up as a fantastic film, not just of its genre but in general too. Terminator 2: Judgement Day is considered one of the best sequels ever made, and it is a consensus that I agree with. While it does lack somewhat in its predecessor's darkness and brutality, it delivers just as much in the writing and action and feels bigger and richer.\n\nHere in Terminator 2: Judgement Day the budget is clearly bigger. This is especially true in the special effects, they were the only things in the first film that didn't hold up as well as the rest of the film but they were still not bad at all, here the effects are stunning, the liquid melting effects on the T-1000 model blow the mind still today. It is photographed slickly and beautifully, maintaining the dark audaciousness of the first film., and while the sets and lighting are not quite as nightmarish they are every bit as imaginative and atmospheric. It is superbly directed by James Cameron, and it's scored appropriately hauntingly.\n\nTerminator 2: Judgement Day's script is just as snappy and even takes on a hard-edged tone in some parts, more so than the original, while the roller-coaster action is thrilling in every sense, without being overblown or dominating the film too much at the expense of depth, the bigger budget aiding and adding to the experience rather than swamping it. The story is still enormous fun, beautifully paced with few if any longueurs and very suspenseful.\n\nLinda Hamilton gives another terrific performance, that is more depth than her performance in the first film, Robert Patrick is spine-chilling and once again Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in by far his most conic role that was tailor-made for him.\n\nIn conclusion, a fantastic sequel that deserves its distinction as one of the best sequels ever made. It's the only Terminator sequel to be close to the quality of the original, and the only one that's above good level. For me, if asked which is the better film between the first film and this they're about equal, in their own ways 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Truly the most thrilling action movie I've seen in ages.\n\nDirector James Cameron's sci-fi action-thriller sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) may be as good, if not more exciting than The Terminator (1984). I love how moody James Cameron's direction looks and feels. The entire Terminator 2 has a blue color palette that's lovely to look at with bright white lights to illuminate the shadows. Cinematographer Adam Greenberg's wide shots are pretty, but it's his hypnotic close-up and medium shots of Linda Hamilton's pensive Sarah Connor in the quieter moments that look the best. All the angles and perspectives really allow for the new CGI to show off crazy things Robert Patrick's T-1000 villain can do. Terminator 2 looks amazing decades later with effects that are not dated.\n\nCameron's direction is all killer, no filler with plenty of bloody shootouts, intense chases, and funny one liners. It's basically one long chase sequence as Linda Hamilton's heroine Sarah Connor and Edward Furlong's John Connor are being chased by Robert Patrick's shape-shifting robot assassin Terminator serial number T-1000. His liquid metal body allows for insane bullet soaking and outrageously fun sequences that make him a relentless villain like Arnold in the first Terminator film. Seeing him kill the night shift guard is still shocking and entertaining. Arnold casually tossing people around like The Terminators is really like a logical conclusion to Hal 3000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey if he had a body, complete with red eyes. Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a fabulously crafted film and an exhilarating action-thriller movie for the ages.\n\nThere's really clever thought put into the robotic movements, groundbreaking visual effects, and violent action to entertain us from writers James Cameron and William Wisher. That first encounter when you think Arnold's Terminator is still the villain about to shoot John Connor, then he unveils his shotgun from the roses to unload into The T-1000 instead is one of cinema's coolest moments. Immediately, followed by The T-1000 healing and reforming his liquid metal body back to normal after being repeatedly shot. The slick writing for Terminator 2 breaks down the rules for T-1000's morphing due to its poly-alloy into him changing due to liquid metal is very easy for audiences to follow. I love lines like Arnold saying \"Your foster parents are dead.\" It's a clever script with nifty sci-fi ideas for The Terminator, earnest understanding for John Connor, and redemption for Sarah Connor. It's more about humanizing Arnold's Terminator and getting to cool action rather than an original sci-fi concept, but Terminator 2 works.\n\nMaking The T-1000 a cop in appearance was deliberate as social commentary on James Cameron's part. John Connor's step-parents blindly trusting Robert Patrick's cop, even though he's a killer, just because he looks like a police officer is brilliant commentary. Every adult and kid just Thinking about how police get away with murder or crimes because of their powerful status in society and position of authority is interesting. It's so funny watching Arnold mess with the cops in T2. Besides the corporation of Skynet producing Terminators as the robots that destroy humanity for profit motives is a neat critique of capitalism. The psychologist not listening to Sarah Connor despite knowing a man massacred the entire police station in the first Terminator really hits home about how flawed the mental health facilities are in the United States. Sarah's \"How were you supposed to know?\" speech is a brilliant criticism of the ethics of scientific advances that can cause ruination.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is fantastic as the fearsome Terminator. Now even funnier and kinder as he assumes a father figure role for John Connor. Arnold looks cool and effortless as he kills or tosses people around, but it's his serious performance that feels so touching and timeless.\n\nLinda Hamilton is very captivating, pensive, sympathetic, and cool as heroine Sarah Connor. She shoots guns like Arnold and gives a moving and profound performance as a revolutionary against machines, mother to a future leader, and heroine against violent forces. Her narration and expressive acting are remarkable in Terminator 2.\n\nEdward Furlong is likable and funny as John Connor. I appreciate how thoughtful he feels even as a child actor. There's a lot of responsibility on John, and Furlong depicts his conflicted feelings naturally. Robert Patrick is eerie and entertaining as the relentless T-1000. His crazy running and subtle expressions do feel like a killer robot might make them as they search onwards for their dreaded mission.\n\nEditors Mark Goldblatt, Richard A. Harris, and Conrad Buff IV shove violent action scene after scene in your face with a breakneck pace, so you never notice Terminator 2 is 137 minutes long until the credits roll. Production designer Joseph C. Nemec III makes labs, trucks, and factories that look realistic with an industrial feel. Joseph P. Lucky, Charles William Breen, and Gary Diamond's art direction creates striking imagery like the nuclear bomb explosion to the T-1000's endless transformations and injures like he's The Thing. John M. Dwyer and Carole Lee Cole's set decoration has natural 1991 furniture and props, but especially with a gritty industrial look of metal everywhere.\n\nVisual effects artists Dennis Muren, Doug Chiang, Alison Savitch, Janet Healy, Leslie Huntley, Gene Warren Jr., and Andrew Kennedy steals the show with groundbreaking and creative usage of CGI. The CGI does not look dated to me like so many early visual effects done on computers. Having practical miniatures when possible and CGI for when the T-1000 melts down or through objects is pretty creative and balanced. CGI really should only be used sparingly like in Terminator 2.\n\nComposer Brad Fiedel's thudding synth score has beautiful melodies and hectic suspense within his exciting score. Even in 1991, synths in scores sounded wonderful. Sound designers Gary Rydstrom, Gloria S. Borders, Tom Johnson, Richard Hymns, Tim Holland, Teresa Eckton, Ethan van der Ryn, Robert Shoup, Ken Fischer, E. Larry Oatfield, Gary Summers, Kevin Rose-Williams, and John Rotondi come up with all sorts of neat noises. From flesh ripping off the Terminator's arm or the T-1000 transforming from liquid to solid. The nuclear explosion sounds massive.\n\nMarlene Stewart gives Arnold a killer black leather ensemble, but it's Marlene's outfits for Linda Hamilton that impressed me the most. Her black combat gear looks so sexy, practical, fitting, and fashionable on her. Make-up artists Ed French, Jeff Dawn, and Steve LaPorte gave Linda Hamilton neat hairstyles and a nice natural look that makes her stand out.\n\nIn all, Terminator 2 is a fun blast and highly influential. You can see in every scene where some other movie found influence for the characters, story, or an action set piece. Think about Mr. Smith taking over bodies in The Matrix and compare that to The T-1000's morphing and impersonations. What a film.",

With the super-strong director James Cameron controlling the science fiction movies he is good at, and with the advancement of animation special effects technology, there is no need to care about the small flaws in the movies. The most exciting is the action scene between Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 and Robert Patrick's T-1000, where guns obviously only have the effect of stopping or slowing down the enemy team. Superstar actor Linda Hamilton presents the character and aspirations of Sarah Connor with her near-perfect acting skills. There is also a super surprise, that is, John Connor (Sarah Connor's son) played by the young Edward Furlong, and the father-son relationship derived from the T-800 is absolutely tear-jerking at the last moment. The above four characters collide with sparks with each other, and they were very clearly shaped. The shuttle between the present and the future by a time machine also means futurism. The worries caused by technology are bound to be checked by human beings earlier, so as to avoid irreversible consequences. It's really rare to have such a wonderful and well-organized story paired with intense and shocking action scenes, and no one can deny that it is a legend.

Terminator 2: Judgement Day is considered one of the best sequels ever made, and it is a consensus that I agree with. While it does lack somewhat in its predecessor's darkness and brutality, it delivers just as much in the writing and action and feels bigger and richer.\n\nHere in Terminator 2: Judgement Day the budget is clearly bigger. This is especially true in the special effects, they were the only things in the first film that didn't hold up as well as the rest of the film but they were still not bad at all, here the effects are stunning, the liquid melting effects on the T-1000 model blow the mind still today. It is photographed slickly and beautifully, maintaining the dark audaciousness of the first film., and while the sets and lighting are not quite as nightmarish they are every bit as imaginative and atmospheric. It is superbly directed by James Cameron, and it's scored appropriately hauntingly.\n\nTerminator 2: Judgement Day's script is just as snappy and even takes on a hard-edged tone in some parts, more so than the original, while the roller-coaster action is thrilling in every sense, without being overblown or dominating the film too much at the expense of depth, the bigger budget aiding and adding to the experience rather than swamping it. The story is still enormous fun, beautifully paced with few if any longueurs and very suspenseful.\n\nLinda Hamilton gives another terrific performance, that is more depth than her performance in the first film, Robert Patrick is spine-chilling and once again Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in by far his most conic role that was tailor-made for him.\n\nIn conclusion, a fantastic sequel that deserves its distinction as one of the best sequels ever made. It's the only Terminator sequel to be close to the quality of the original, and the only one that's above good level. For me, if asked which is the better film between the first film and this they're about equal, in their own ways 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "An absolutely amazing and timeless film packed with so much content and heart. This film is the pinnacle of 'intelligent' action and story telling in an action film driven by story and it's characters. A movie that gets so much right; an action movie with purpose. In telling the story and building it's world, nothing goes to waste. Every action, every gunshot, every explosion, every character interaction has intricate value.\n\nThe action isn't just eye candy or effects for the sake of it, but an important means by which to clue us into characters, motivations and their capabilities. Two Terminators grappling isn't just a hero and a villain fighting for control, it's the moment our expectations are subverted - the bigger machine isn't necessarily the strongest. As a vehicle sustains damage it only further demonstrates the ruthless persistence of the villain as we see it unblinkingly push aside the wreckage of it's own vehicle the same as with it's own impactful driving. Action with substance, that sells the characters embroiled in in intense action.\n\nThis is a movie about humanity. A movie in which Sarah has set aside her own humanity in anticipation and response to a looming machine threat, prepared to do whatever it ruthlessly takes to avert Judgment Day. A movie in which a machine programmed to protect and follow orders begins to understand what it means to be human. And at the center of it is John, a character who finds his purpose and place in the world, taught by Sarah in preparation for the future but becoming the heart of the film and to those around him.\n\nThe actors deserve a tonne of praise. Linda Hamilton as the intense haunted Sarah. Arnold Schwarzenegger as the stoic machine becoming the increasingly humanised 'Uncle Bob' figure. Edward Furlong's transformation from a bratty kid to (as stated) becoming the central figure and heart of the film. Robert Patrick's efforts in bringing the sleek efficient cold T-1000 to life, unflinching, unwavering and determined to accomplish it's mission. Even Earl Boen's performance as detestable Dr Silberman makes for a satisfying side-villain to the larger plot.\n\nPerhaps one of the greatest strengths of the movie comes from the fact that (despite it's length) it feels a complete and satisfying experience from start to finish. So much happens during the run time, but it never feels like a slog. An  element T2 Judgment Day does so well is convey the scope of 'what's at stake', managing it's use of threats and obstacles that the core characters face very well - the T-1000 isn't the point of the film in itself, and yet feels entirely relevant even if not present the entire time. \n\nThe movie soundtrack composed by Brad Fiedel is also extremely memorable, providing important flavour for the many memorable moments and for representing the characters, from the metallic heart-beat like clanging sound of the T-800, to the haunting noises accompanying the creepy unnerving T-1000. \n\nThe film is absolute must see and complete experience.",

The best actress that year was Jodie Foster in \u2018Silence of the Lambs', another \u2018strong' female lead. I love \u2018Lambs', but the emotional and physical transformations between Jodie Foster's character and Linda Hamilton's character are incomparable. \n\nJodie Foster was calm and composed in her male-dominated field (FBI). It was a fine performance, but Hamilton changed her entire body for T2. In addition, her character was suffering from insanity, trauma and conflict. From the scenes when Hamilton is just staring into space to her one handed shotgun reload, her performance covers the entire gambit. \n\nThe best supporting actress that year was Mercedes Ruehl in \u2018The Fisher King'. Does anyone remember that movie or even who Mercedes Ruehl is? Other nominations were Jessica Tandy for \u2018Fried Green Tomatoes', Dianne Ladd for \u2018Rambling Rose' and Kate Nelligan for \u2018The Prince of Tides'.\n\nDoes anyone under 50 know who these actresses are or ever heard of the movies? The academy had the perfect opportunity to support a truly strong and complex female character and instead threw the award away. Really\u2026 Mercedes Ruehl? Obviously, the oscars are a political show, but c'mon man!",

Those issues aside, they're small enough, but they kind of bothered me. Nitpicks aside, the plot made sense if you ignore the time paradoxes, and the characters were amazing. John Connor, despite being only ten years old, is a great lead character, and Edward Furlong's acting is brilliant, by both child acting standards, and acting standards in general. Linda Hamilton also demonstrates an amazing transformation from the first movie, and Arnold Schwarzenegger goes from stoic killing machine to a self-aware machine that learns what it means to be human. The visual effects hold up great, with one or two nitpicks I won't emphasize. It all enhances the story where it's used, only adding to the T-1000's threat. The pulse pounding soundtrack, and great dynamic between John and the T-800 add to the spectacular action set pieces, all of which are the primary elements that hold it up to this day, as well as its theme of the future being yours to write.",

I genuinely did not know how the main characters would survive. The action is exciting and suspenseful with that motorcycle chase being the standout and that twist with Arnold's character being our Kyle Reese in this movie is brilliant! Speaking of brilliant, this movie somehow got me emotionally invested into a cyborg whether it was T-800's beautiful relationship with John as well as his sacrifice in the end, showing that while he's a cyborg, he has a ton of emotion in his heart. Sarah becomes a badass in this movie and I love the mother-son bond with John.

            "content": "Terminator 2: Judgement Day - 10/10. James Cameron's sci-fi masterpiece celebrates its 30th anniversary this year, and the movie just keeps getting better as it ages. Cameron delivered the cult classic The Terminator in 1984, which ended up launching the careers of himself, Linda Hamilton, and of course the biggest action star the world will soon to see, Arnold Schwarzenegger. So when he decided to do a sequel, 7 years later, a lot of people were wondering how and what he will do. Not only was the sequel the biggest budgeted film of all time till that date, but it upped the stakes both scope and story wise. Never have we seen a small budget film get a huge increase in production for its sequel, but considering Cameron's ascent to mega director status, Carolco decided to take a chance and give the director complete creative/financial freedom. The end result was an R rated, cold and bombastic sci-fi action film that would raise the genre to new heights, and raise the CGI bar even higher (before Jurassic Park elevated CGI to the highest stratosphere possible). T2 is a perfect example of allowing a director to tell their story and allow them to craft it in a way that would really show their flair and trademarks in storytelling. What Cameron did was really raise the bar on the apocalyptic stakes that were introduced in the first film. With the money he was able to literally show the fire and destruction of what could happen if Skynet was able to go with their plans. It really hits you hard as a viewer and makes you understand that this film is not gonna hold back. He elevates the Sarah Connor character, making Hamilton give the best performance of her career as the now jaded and determined Connor, whose screen presence is off the charts. Arnold as the T1000 is amazing because Cameron directs him to his strengths: being a physical mammoth whose cold dialogue delivery matches the robot character. Robert Patrick as the villain is also cool, bringing an agile and malleable threat to the characters. But what I appreciate the most about this film is its message of easing on the reliance of tech. A message that is important to this day than it was 3 decades ago.",

Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance is one of his better ones and I think he perfectly transitions himself from a killer machine we feared like he is in the first one, to the guy we all wish we had as a friend. I really like the first film, however, I like this film even more. I can't find a single thing wrong with it.

The terminators don't voluntary \"chat\", they more vomit exposition dialogue.\n\nWhile I'll always remember this as a great movie, it isn't without its flaws.

The characters are emotionally affecting and relatable - the ending sealed the depth about what humanity is all about. And while there is a nonstop actions stunts to thrill viewers, I also enjoyed its core story about the value of human life. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong were unforgettable trio lead here - you'll be attached to their adventure here. Even the cyborg antagonist Robert Patrick was commendable here. This is highly recommended classic sci-fi action!",

            "content": "It never occurred to me before, but T2 is really an archetypal \"A Boy and His Dog\" story along the lines of \"Old Yeller\" or \"Pete's Dragon\" or \"ET: The Extraterrestrial.\" I'll assume anyone reading this has already seen the movie, so spoilers ahead. Arnold Schwarzenegger was a huge star when this sequel was made, so this time he HAD to be the hero of the film, this time becoming the protector of a young John Connor, who is being hunted by a more advanced Terminator model played to perfection by Robert Patrick with cold animal-like predatory menace. The \"Boy and His Dog\" story starts fairly quickly, as a young John Connor befriends the futuristic killer cyborg. Connor teaches him tricks (i.e. that car keys are often under sun visors and, of course, \"Hasta la vista, baby\"), the boy and his pet Terminator save each other at different points in the film, and in the end John has to give his beloved Terminator a sad farewell that's every bit as touching as when the boy  in \"Old Yeller\" says to his mama \"Listen. Old Yeller just saved your life and Elizabeth's, too. And he saved mine and Arliss'. We can't. We don't know for certain. I'll pen him up where he can't get out. A-and then we'll wait. We could not shoot up like he was nothing. Don't you understand?\" Or when Elliott in \"E.T.\" tells his pet alien \"You could be happy here, I could take care of you. I wouldn't let anybody hurt you. We could grow up together, E.T.\" And in T2, it's every bit as touching when the Terminator tells John there is another Cyberdyne chip that must also be destroyed, to which John replies, \"No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us! Don't do it.  Please... don't go --\" with tears streaming down his face. So my point here is that you pair the durable \"Boy and His Dog\" story with wildly exciting and muscular action courtesy of director/co-writer James Cameron (man, do I wish he'd make a straight-up non-preachy action film again ALA \"The Terminator\" or \"Aliens\") and strong performances by Patrick as the T-1000, Edward Furlong as the young John Connor, and particularly Linda Hamilton as the fierce and buffed our tiger mom, Sarah Connor, you have a movie that's pretty irresistible. The CGI does seem fairly primitive at times, but most of it surprisingly holds up with the mix of practical and CGI when displaying the T-1000's knives and stabbing weapons. If I did have a complaint upon rewatching T2, it's that the sequel shifted too greatly in tone from the original, relying too much on one-liners and comedic elements. Admittedly, the one-liners are good and the comedy is genuinely funny, but the hard edge of the original is what makes that first film easily the best in the series. Still, sequels of this era had a penchant for radical shifts in tone and story (i.e. \"Mad Max\" to the \"The Road Warrior\" or \"First Blood\" to \"Rambo: First Blood Part II\"). Overall, although T2 takes a major shift in the direction of family-friendly with the \"A Boy and His Dog\" storyline, but the characters, story, and especially the action are brilliant and impossible not to enjoy.",

From the epic and memorable performances of Hamilton, Schwarzenegger and Furlong to the expertly chosen and designed filming locations to the mood-inducing and perfectly-complimentary soundtrack, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a hallmark in moviemaking and a touchstone in modern cinema. Still mesmerizing to watch after all of these years. In the summer of 1991, the sequel was truly an event. And in 2020, it's easy to understand why the subsequent movies simply couldn't come close to measuring up and why they were met with outright disdain from many fans. The franchise should have ended with T2. I still wonder about the potential of a James Cameron-helmed third movie in 1993 or 1994 with the trio of leading actors returning. Commercially, it likely would have been huge. The anticipation and expectations also would have been enormous. But it wasn't meant to be. T2 undoubtedly could never be topped or even equaled. The story was complete. A moment in time never to be duplicated.",

The first amazing thing is the terminators lets first talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger returning as a terminator but this time having him be light hearted and learning humans which comes to one of my favourite scenes in the film where Arnold takes a closer look at a toddler, the other terminator who I call Austin is a great villain for the film posing as an actual threat for our characters. Again like the previous film has great practical effects in my opinion that are better than the first terminator as some of the action scenes would be hard to create with green screens and SFX. I think the links and references to the first film are amazing. Another amazing part of the film is the emotions from Sarah Connor wanting to see her son and the ending scene. Also the dread you fell is scary and really makes you want them to stop Judgement Day. In conclusion this in my opinion is a perfect film for all of the reasons I have explained so all in all this is in my top 10 films of all time.\n\nJust to say thank you for all the people who read my movie reviews I really do appreciate it. Thank you so much.",

            "content": "The original Terminator is one of the most intense sci-fi/action movies I've ever seen. T2 is not nearly as thrilling and suspenseful as the original. And that's why I found this sequel, which considered to be even superior to the original, slightly underwhelming. The action set-pieces are almost as good as those in the first movie, and due to the the fact that this one has a massively higher budget, the action sequences feel even more well-shot. The visual effects look fantastic, and surprisingly still hold up pretty well. But the problem isn't about the action nor the CGI; it's about the situations and the conditions here that couldn't make me worry about the characters as I should. Even at its climax, the intensity pale in comparison to that's I felt whenever a car chase or a small fighting scene come in the original.\n\nAnother issue I have with this movie is that it drags a little bit at its second act. I don't mean it gets boring at all, but it feels a bit devoid and empty halfway through. Maybe better storytelling could have fixed that. I also have a couple of nitpicks, but I can't say they hindered my experience of watching the movie.\n\nThat said, James Cameron doubled down almost every single aspect in the story and the characters to make a new extremely taut story that expanded the characters' arc like I've never seen before in any film. The dialogue between the three main characters and even the story itself revealed that the characters, humans or cyborgs, have extra more layers into them. Even the villain is effortlessly well-rounded, and he oozes the impressive development Cameron has made in this world, that of course in addition to the fact that Robert Patrick is quite intimidating and so iconic as T-1000.\n\nThere is nothing can top what have been already said about Linda Hamelton's character, Sarah Connor, which definitely deserves its place among the absolute best female characters ever appeared on the silver screen. With that being said, I prefer to praise the astonishing chemistry between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Edward Furlong as the titular cyborg and John Connor, respectively. From the spot-on jokes and funny one-liners to the surprisingly moving and heartwarming scenes the two characters shared, the dynamic between these two endearing characters is simply unmatchable! Furlong is sadly a wasted talent that proved in this movie and American History X that he has a grand range and monumental acting abilities. Here he walked a very thin line between being an imprudent, reckless teen and an innocent child to bring out a likable, relatable, and quite convincing character.\n\nJudgment Day is undoubtedly one of the best sequels ever made, but in my opinion it didn't surpass the original, nor even reach its level. That's in large part due to its relative lack of suspense that's arguably the best merit the original has.\n\n(8/10)",

Back in the day when you could have a strong female lead without all the \"hey, look at me I'm an all-powerful girl!!!\" hype behind it, just a cool female character in a well-done action movie. The was a lot of humour thrown in which also made the movie very enjoyable. By today's standards, the effects are common, however, back then, all of that shape-shifting CGI was cutting edge and other than possibly \"The Abyss\" if I remember correctly, no other movie had ever done this kind of shape-shifting effect before, and definitely not all the way through the movie like this one. 5/5 for being what a sci fi action movie should be and throwing in a lot of humour too.",

Schwarznegger pulls the transition of character type fantastically. \n\nIt all boils down to preference. If you want nitty gritty cyberpunk, go for terminator.

The acting, the action scenes, the characters, the CGI, the emotional impact, etc. it's all far superior. The first Terminator, while amazing in its own way, has a CGI that's almost laughably outdated, but this film's special effects are amazing. So amazing, in fact, it still looks better than half of anything coming out this year. And this film came out over 25 years ago. The action is exhilarating, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor is an uber badass, Schwarzengger as the good guy this time around was a pleasant surprise, Robert Patrick as the T-1000 is just as terrifying as Arnie from the first film. Arguably the best part was the amount of raw emotion this film elicits, from just how a remorseless killing machine can learn to feel and act like a human. It was so touching. The relationship between John and the T-800 was fantastic, and the bond they shared was so powerful to me that in the end, I shed a tear. I am not ashamed to admit this. This is one of 3 films to ever make me shed a tear. This film is everything I would ever want in an action film. Ever. It's my favorite action film of all time, and no matter what James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzengger are doing nowadays, this film, has cemented both of them in my top 10 favorites forever. 10/10",

It was released in 1991, but the special effects are as stunning to this very day as the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. A mixture of CGI and regular practical effects and it's still pleasing to the eye. I completely agree with Jeremy of CinemaSins' statement about how the effects were a lot better than the ones we have nowadays. From what I heard, some of the effects weren't even CGI despite what their visual appearance would suggest. The T1000 is an intimidating villain who is a guy you should run away from really fast because of his sword-hands, ability to blend in with the floor and look like your long-lost twin if you're the same size (FUN FACT: Those were actual twins in the scene with the guard). Unlike the first film, the R rating is justified here. Arnold Schwarzenneger is awesome in this movie as he becomes one of the good guys. The action sequences are great, even better than the first. Sarah Connor evolves from the first film from a damsel in distress who will become a great leader into a badass action girl. I also found the movie to be deep at heart as I was really invested into how John taught the T800 human things as the T800 learns the value of human life. One of the most genuine bonds I have seen in ages. In many ways, T2 succeeds where the first film failed.",

What I love most about this film it that even though it's an Action Spectacle and has Incredible action set pieces it's more about characters and there relationships.   it has wonderfully written and well developed characters who all have a beginning, middle and end, Linda Hamilton blew me away in this movie with her performance as Sarah Conner, i did like her in the first one but I loved her more  in this one she bought so many layers and dimensions to her character that you really cared for her and understood where she's coming from. Edward Furlong was also really good and I really liked his relationship with The Terminator who I'll talk about in a sec. Now onto the T-1000 who was a great and menacing Villian played Brilliantly by Robert Patrick I loved how he was an advanced prototype that made  him almost unbeatable. Now onto The Terminator played again by Arnold Schwarzenegger I liked how james Cameron turned him from a great villian to a great hero and to be honest I actually prefer the hero one reason being is that I said I really like the chemistry between him and young John Conner their relationship was funny heartwarming and also unexpectedly emotional. Obviously the Special Effects were Revolutionary at the time and still to this day hold up Extremely well. A phenomenal film that actually gets better and better as I watch it every time. The story is engaging,a smart script with great character depth, fantastic direction with  breathtaking Action Sequences THIS MOVIE IS A TRIUMPH.",

The sequel, according to Linda Hamilton's Wikipedia page is scheduled for 2021.\n\nAs I watched T:2 over the weekend, I noticed something rather odd about the T-1000. When he was shot, blown up, and later melted in a pool of molten steel. He had no wiring or electrical components.\n\nIf he was truly a robot, cyborg, or android, then he would have had to have these components in order to function. Even in the end of the movie when his body was blasted open with a grenade launcher and his insides were exposed, there was no wiring or electrical components. This factor combined with his abilities to shape-shift and regenerate leads me to believe that this was no ordinary robot.\n\nThe T-1000's extraordinary composition and abilities lead me to believe that he was an alien and not a robot.\n\nI believe that the 2021 sequel to T:2 should explore the possibilities of alien involvement in the creation of Skynet, and in the operations of Skynet, in the \"Terminator\" universe.",

            "content": "T2: Judgment day came out seven years after the original. The original was a very good and unique sci-fi horror movie that just so happened to be an action film, but the second in the franchise has the better movie, a better story, better action, better. everything. Sarah Connor is in prison because she has been wrongfully accused of being crazy due to her belief of the Terminator which tried to kill her in the first film. Her son, John Connor (Edward Furlong in his first role) is in foster care with awful parents, but he spends most of his time away from them. In the first film, the T-800 was sent to kill Sarah, but this time, Skynet sends a different terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). A basically indestructible and a more deadly terminator made of liquid metal. T-1000 has the ability to morph into anything and anyone, creating an antagonist to watch out for. He is sent to kill John so that in the future, the resistance would not have a leader. Except, John in the future reprograms the T-800 to go and protect him as a child (11-12 years old I think). Played masterfully by Schwarzenegger himself. Let me start off by saying that this movie is perfect, not a single flaw. Everything that was great about the first movie is multiplied several times to an extent of being THE best action film that will ever be made. It was an interesting twist to see the antagonist from the first film being one of the three protagonists in this one. I'm sure we can all agree that Arnold is a cooler hero than a villain. The king of sci-fi action, James Cameron, is back directing this one as well. I think he did a better job making this one. He brought a deep, emotional relationship between the T-800 and John Connor that was a very heartfelt and believable concept. Not to mention some of the best visuals ever put to the big screen that revolutionized the movie industry in a huge way. It was very influential and it still holds up extremely well. The action scenes are arguably the best ever put to screen. All of them were noticeably practical. As many have said: You don't need extreme violence to make effective action.\nOver all, T2 without a doubt, surpassed the original. It is the best sequel ever made, one of the best sci-fi films ever made, the best action film ever...\n\nheck with it, it's one of the best movies ever made period. 5/5 stars",

First the action is phenomenal, even though this film came out in the 90s it had good action and not the cheesy kind in the matrix. Yes the special effects for the metal terminator did suck and were cheesy you just have to remember it's an old movie. Now the plot and that Arnold is not longer a bad guy terminator but now is a good nice reprogrammed terminator protecting a  young John Connor. I like that Arnold's the good guy but who cares who's he plays better they're both really good. So yeah the plot, old John Connor sends a good Arnold to protect his younger self so that the metal terminator doesn't murder the fudge out of him with that little finger of his. I just like the plot, it's simple and not too complicated like alien where you have to pin point everything. Now finally the ending, if your reading this you should have already seen this movie so spoilers, good terminator dies and he dies with a thumbs up oh and the metal terminator dies too but who cares, it's all about Arnold, nobody else. My thumb is up. Now the bad, that kid was annoying, that's why I put a half star.",

            "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the special achievement that you all been waiting for, the sequel to the first film, Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Well, here it is, the sequel to The Terminator directed by James Cameron. It won 4 Oscars at the Academy Awards. One for Best Sound, Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Makeup. It was the highest grossing film of 1991 making up to $519 million over $102 million budget. How unbelievable is that? With Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor narrating having his son John Connor become the Human Resistance leader against Skynet - the artificial intelligence that will be given control of the United States' nuclear missiles and initiate a nuclear holocaust called ''Judgment Day'' on August 1997. But this film came out in 1991 so there's no way that'll happen in real life. Sarah was arrested and imprisoned at a mental hospital after attempting to bomb a computer factory. So why didn't it show about what happened back there? Why didn't it show about what happened after she got pregnent to John Connor and she got arrested? Oh well. Anyways, Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as The Terminator, this time a good guy. He went to the bar, wore somebody's clothes, took some sun glasses and ride off into the motorcycle. But then, a new terminator called T-1000 played by Robert Patrick is sent back in time to assassinate John Connor but was confronted by The Terminator who is sent back in time to protect John Connor. You can see why The Terminator is the second terminator and he become good because the first from the first Terminator movie is evil 'cause Sarah killed it. As the Terminator shoots T-1000, you can see that he is liquid metal. He can go through objects, walk through fire and become different people. The visual effects on T-1000 is absolutely incredible. Earl Boen as Dr. Silberman is a psychiatrist of Sarah Connor. He only had a small from the first film. He sounds like Rex from Toy Story. He sounds so similar than Wallace Shawn. I don't know. I just thought about it years ago. Michael Biehn has a cameo role in this and his acting is brilliant in this where he warns Sarah that John Connor's the target now. The scene where The Terminator and John called the Foster parents and The Terminator can imitate voices and realizing they're already dead. So The Terminator and John breaks Sarah free from the hospital and T-1000. They rescued Sarah and The Terminator says ''Come with me if you want to live.'' Damn, I forgot about that quote from the first Terminator film like what Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese said and The Terminator imitating the voices. I like the scene where Sarah stops Miles Dyson, creator of Skynet played by Joe Morton from letting Judgment Day happen. The Terminator and John arrive at his house and warns him to destroy the items and the designs in Cyberdyne. There's an amazing scene where The Terminator cut his arm and pulls his off  making him realize that he's a cyborg. So they went into the Cyberdyne building to destroy all the stuff and retrieve the CPU and the arm. Miles Dyson get shot and sacrifices himself by exploding the entire building. Now there's no way for him to kill himself because he got shot, I really like him. I really like that scene actually is because he gasping repeatedly and says ''I don't know how much longer I can hold this.'' I use to say that when I was feeling sick years ago. The chase scene and the final battle between The Terminator, Sarah, John and T-1000 is phenomenal. I even love the part where Arnold says ''Hasta la vista, baby.'' The final scene where the Terminator says goodbye to John Connor is actually kinda sad but aside from that he says '' I know now why you cry, but it is something I could never do.'' and  went into the lava and gives John a thumbs up. Many people love this movie just like I do so does my friends Jacob Dimmock, Thomas Raddings and Shannon Walker. Everybody's a huge fan of The Terminator films. I definitely think the first and the second are as good as each other.  Much like from the 1980s, it's not classed as a horror film. It's more than the 80s sci-fi action film much like what James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd did. This movie is kind of long. I think it's 147 mins long.  Not that long though but it's considered be the longest film of the franchise. As far as sequels go, this movie is considered one of the best, most greatest films of all times much like my favorite film The Terminator the first one. But the first Terminator doesn't include at the Oscars it's still one  of the greatest films of all time much like the sequel. From the beauty and the majesty of The Silence of the Lambs and Disney's Beauty and the Beast, this movie is most thrilling, most watchable, most greatest and most high rated movie at all time. In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger: I'm back!",

The extended special edition only adds more extended scenes and a few cut scenes to an already great film but the added footage does flesh out the characters more but proved unnecessary for the theatrical cut of which trimmed over 15 minutes of footage down to a 136 minute release. This extended cut as I like to call it is what I remember enjoying most because it was exclusive when first released on pioneer laserdisc and vhs special edition cuts. The extended footage had some extremely impressive special effects Stan Winston pulled off including using the real life twin of  actor Linda Hamilton. This scene alone was worth the extra money for this cut. Anyway sit back and enjoy an extended cut of your favorite terminator movie :) you won't be disappointed.",

During this movie Sarah Connor runs into multiple issues dealing with working with this Terminator who tried to kill he many years ago, and I think this was handled carefully  and quite well and I thought this movie dealt with emotion quite well, an issue with this movie is some of the acting in this movie is quite off from everyone, but you can tell they put a lot of heart into it.

A terminator was sent back in the past to kill John Connor before he was able to become a influential leader. However future John Connor sends the terminator who tried to kill his mother back in time to save past John Connor (terminator was different but looked the same). John's mother is locked up in a mental hospital, John is living with foster parents and the terminators are hot on their tails. So it is a race to see which terminator gets there first unfortunately they get there at the same moment. What happens you ask? Sparks fly and the action gets intense. Then John does something foolish he risk the lives of all 3 of them by deciding to break his mother out of the why don't you believe me because I am not crazy mental facility. As you would expect from that moment until the end it's nothing but bang, bang shoot'em up, blow'em up, destroy and fight to finish the job. I say A+, 100%, 10/10, 5stars.
