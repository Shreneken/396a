            "content": "I've probably never seen DeNiro enjoy a role so much in any other film than in Cape Fear. He straight up swoops up the limelight with his campy, over the top and sadistic portrayal of a psychopath who believes in the works of Nietzsche the philosopher and is out for revenge on his lawyer who buried evidence in a case he lost 14 years ago.\n\nThe story here is a simple one, there isn't anything extraordinary or new, it's a revenge drama, what more can you even expect. What shines here is the screenplay, it is clever and likes to hide things from you all while telling you things about the characters in subtle and sometimes violent ways. The other good thing about this film is it's score. It's daunting and creates a sense of creepiness seeking in your body.\n\nI think what doesn't work for this film is the climax. The tension leading up to the climax is done fairly well, not as much as you'd expect it but there are films which try much harder than this and fail. But, when you reach the very end, you are expecting to hear something sympathetic about a certain character and something empathetic about another character but then you get to know that whatever they've both been doing was in some sort of twisted morality was always right, which creates this sort of dilemma within you as to whose side should I choose? Maybe that was what the film was aiming for, to question the sense of taking sides when the moralities of both the sides is twisted in their own separate ways but I was pretty sure whose side I was on this whole film and the climax didn't change that.\n\nAlthough I'd say Martin Scorsese directs the film fairly well, it's not enough to save it from the otherwise messy climax which turns into a campy action movie of sorts. The first two acts of this film are these medium-paced stalking/cat and mouse games whereas in the 3rd act the film decides to take a wild turn with one thing so absurdingly hilarious that I literally laughed my ass off and for a moment didn't want to believe Scorsese actually came up with this.\n\nI'd say check it out if you love DeNiro because then it'll be a treat for you but otherwise it's pretty lackluster film compared to the high standards of Scorsesian Cinema.",

After serving fourteen years in prison, Max Cady (Robert De Niro) looks to exact revenge on his defense attorney Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) for withholding evidence during the trial that resulted in his conviction.  It is taut, tense and engaging throughout, but there are times where you get the impression that style outweighs substance as Scorsese pulls out every cinematic trick in his vast catalogue, often to the detriment of the story, to the point where the most effective scenes are also the most simplistic (Cady's meeting with Bowden's daughter in the school auditorium, for example).  With the exception of the climactic scene on the boat, which drags on far too long, it is a well-paced thriller that, despite its flaws, will keep audiences on the edge of their seats for the duration.",

The only remark would be the way the movie started and ended, which is one and the same problem. To speak a language the movie understands, it was as if the visible light portion of the spectrum was shown without the infrared and ultraviolet portions. A scene or even a few glimpses of the original crime would have been better than explaining what happened through dialogue, and the same goes for the ending, where the dialogue was superseded by the narrator's voice. In all it still hasn't aged and is indeed a recommended watch.",

In the 1962 original, \"Cape Fear\" Robert Mitchum sas a force of understated malevolence who uses his power as an actor to instill fear in characters and audiences alike.\n\nNo doubt collaborating closely with Scorcese in the remake, De Niro goes in an entirely different direction. His villain is a near-parody of white liberal fear of the southern redneck. On the surface it is physical. De Niro transforms his body into stone and decorates it with tattoos and polyester clothes. Deeper down, De Niro gives us the redneck's cunning and manipulation, able to think a step ahead of his victims and seduce the most vulnerable. And at the bottom is the brutality. De Niro's character dishes it out with sadistic pleasure, not only to enemies but also to the weak, just because they are.\n\nI'm not into comparisons and zero-sum choices about which actor is \"better.\" If this is the kind of thriller that appeals, I think you would enjoy yourself most by watching both versions. For days afterwards you'll be savoring the different approaches the production teams used to tell a virtually identical story. And how often do we get a chance to do that?",

            "content": "On the surface, Cape Fear appears to be a very inconsequential entry to Scorsese's filmography, filmed to pay Universal back for supporting his brilliant but commercially unviable religious epic The Last Temptation of Christ. While Cape Fear is one of the few Scorsese films which pays close attention to its own marketability, Scorsese puts effort into the project, and the final product is incredibly smart. Following a lawyer who is forced to defend himself and his family from hyper-intelligent ex-con Max Cady (played by Robert De Niro, in a remarkably over-the-top performance) seeking revenge for a 14 year prison sentence, Cape Fear touches on numerous topics, but the most central one is the contradictions of the Southern identity. The film is set in North Carolina, and Confederate imagery frequently appears in the background. Most prominently, the Cady has a Confederate flag bumper sticker and is implied to hold racist beliefs. The heroes are also Southerners, but represent a much more idyllic side of the South, living an apparently storybook life in a picturesque small town. The collision of these identities reveals the wider contradictions of the American legal system - a frequent theme in Scorsese's films - with Cady exploiting the system and the characters supposedly on the right side of the law breaking it in response. While I prefer the subtler storytelling style Scorsese employs in previous films, Cape Fear is far from just a forgettable popcorn flick.",

            "content": "Fearsome in every way imaginable.\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese's horror crime thriller Cape Fear (1991) is a formidable remake of the old classic crime drama with Robert Mitchum's scary creep criminal against Gregory Peck's heroic father protagonist. Scorsese's striking direction has colors bursting onto the screen like an old 70's Italian Giallo picture as he modernizes the 1962 film noir original movie into something truly unnerving. Every second is tense and the eerie atmosphere and long held shots of just a predator talking is quite effective. The theater sequence with Robert De Niro molesting Juliette Lewis' teenage girl Danielle is unbelievably disturbing to witness. Scorsese knows how to upset and disturb the viewer. Cape Fear is one of the scariest films ever made.\n\nEditor Thelma Schoonmaker has these wild cuts that are kind of jarring and very in vogue in the 90's. I'm sure Scorsese thought they were cool at the time, but it dates this Cape Fear to 1991 horribly as you are not so much as unnerved as annoyed by them. It goes by quickly for a 128 minute long movie though. Scorsese made such a well made and fascinating film that is still enthralling to watch now, but there are some really goofy whip cuts and sound design choices in the finale. Freddie Francis' cinematography is awesome with beautiful framing of De Niro leering at this family with fireworks exploding behind him to really tight close-up shots of faces with focused shots of characters reacting to things in the background.\n\nWriters John D. MacDonald and Wesley Strick know how to write creepy dialogue as De Niro's predatory establishes his sick motive with these eerie lines of foreboding. It's all about the failures of the law in every sense of the word. Henry Bumstead's production design is creative with miniatures for the house and house-boat, while other sets are entirely made up like the jungle finale for the storm sequences. Jack G. Taylor Jr.'s art direction is neat with thunderstruck skies, fireworks filled skies, and smoke filled air with cigar smoke all to color Cape Fear in strange imagery. Alan Hicks' set decoration looks so natural and realistic for every set. I loved hearing composer Bernard Herrmann's original massive symphonic score again as reworked for modern audiences by Elmer Bernstein. It's still creepy to hear.\n\nRita Ryack came up with all these Hawaiian shirts for De Niro and loafers for a casual looking threat. Dorothy J. Pearl, Edouard F. Henriques, and Elizabeth Lambert's make-up is incredible for all of De Niro's fake tattoos. It's amazing that De Niro gained all that muscle just to look more intimidating as Max Cady. Robert De Niro is scary with his subtle conversations and idle threats that he makes good on with a vicious performance. By the end, he overacts a bit and it loses some of the threat, but he looks imposing at all times. I love his disgusting speech to Juliette Lewis in the theater. Lewis is so brave as Danielle as she endures trauma after trauma with a realistic fear in her eyes.\n\nNick Nolte has that wiley Gary Busey insanity to his performance as the paranoid, worried, idiot lawyer jerk and philanderer Sam. He's so unlikable that you can see his every mistake in handling De Niro's movie monster. Jessica Lange is gorgeous and sympathetic as Nolte's wife. Her argument with Nolte over his cheating is amazing as she feels like a real wife screaming at her cheating husband with righteous indignation. Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck make neat cameos as they were the original villain and hero, respectively. I loved Illeana Douglas' young victim as she is really moving like Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis here.\n\nIn all, Scorsese's Cape Fear remake is terrifying in a modern horror thriller sense, while the original is still superior for haunting atmosphere and deeper nuance.",

Sam lives a simple blue-collar family life with his wife and 15-year-old daughter but soon they all may be in very real danger as the crazed Max has his sights set on Sam and his family and is bound and determined to teach the family what real loss feels like.  \n\nMartin Scorsese does it again teaming up with a favorite in Robert De Niro playing the enigmatic Max Cady. He plays his role so disturbingly it almost feels like he's not acting, at times it feels very real. One of his most convincing roles playing a violent psychopath and my does he shine in this. With Scorsese behind the camera and De Niro in front of it it usually results in magic and this film holds it own with other great Scorsese films. One of those thrillers that puts you on the edge of you're seat and keeps you there. The intensity is amplified throughout with a truly iconic score that promotes this eerie feeling from start to finish. Any hardcore 90's fan or fans of these ‘real life' thrillers can find massive enjoyment in this film.",

            "content": "For its faults, Cape Fear kept me at the edge of my seat for the final third of the movie, which is enough to place it in the recommends — De Niro's performance as Max Cady is what pushes it into the 80s. Cady is sinister and calculating, making me seriously question what he was going to do next and how far he would take his reign of terror on the Bowden family. Nolte gives a great performance as the primary target of Cady's wrath. He's a character who in one scene will make the right decision, and in the next make an impeccably stupid one. Juliette Lewis's performance is a close second to De Niro's, but there were a few moments you really wished she had just been shipped off to boarding school the moment Cady appeared. My biggest gripe with the movie is Cady's motive — after discovering that his lawyer, Sam Bowden, buried exculpatory/mitigating evidence concerning the victim of Cady's crimes, he stews for 14 years in prison plotting his revenge. However, even in 1977, when the trial took place, it is unlikely that the evidence (the victim's \"promiscuity,\" past sexual partners, etc.) would've been admissible anyway under the Rape Shield Laws that were adopted by pretty much every jurisdiction at that time. Basically, the point Cady tries to make, over and over, is that Sam, too, is a criminal. But that parallel was just not there for me. Certainly, Sam violated an ethical obligation to his client (assuming the evidence was admissible) but, as Sam even discloses at the end of the movie, Cady had bragged about evading punishment for his crimes when he was Sam's client, and had committed an equally horrific crime yet again, which Cady never denies. I haven't seen the original Cape Fear (1962) starring the excellent Robert Mitchum (who appears in a handful of scenes in this version as a police lieutenant), but I have read that the Sam character in that version (played by Gregory Peck who also has a small role in this version again as a lawyer, not so coincidentally as Cady's attorney against Sam this time (try to keep up)) had a much more proactive role in Cady's incarceration, thereby making the villain a slightly more sympathetic character and his motive more understandable. Nevertheless, Cape Fear is thrilling and frustrating; stupid at times, but fun at others.",

            "content": "This film was made at the point in Scorsese's career at which he appears to be obsessed with making genre films, he had previously experimented with the musical in New York, New York (1977) and he would go on to make The Age of Innocence (1993), a period drama, and Kundun (1997), a biographical epic. Cape Fear is a Hitchcockian psychological thriller that revisits Scorsese's usual themes of religious punishment and redemption and the nature of evil. The film is extremely entertaining and adding the theme of sexual awakening makes the film feel more modern and interesting.\n\nMorally dubious lawyer Sam Bowden, Nick Nolte, has a beautiful wife, Jessica Lange, and a daughter wrestling with her burgeoning sexuality, Juliette Lewis. 14 years previously Bowden served as the defense attorney for Max Cady, Robert De Niro, a man who violently raped a young woman. Due to Bowden's disgust at Cady's crime he did not present evidence that could have reduced Cady's sentence significantly. Cady is now out of prison and wants revenge on Bowden and his family but he uses intimidation tactics that are not legally criminal and as Cady's threats get worse and worse Bowden is forced to confront Cady himself.\n\nThe pulpy thrillers of the 1960s are not my favorite form of entertainment but I will admit that the best of them are able to ratchet up the suspense and leave you feeling afraid for your own life and this 1991 flick does achieve that same creepiness. De Niro is a great villain and as soon as we see his large back tattoo which displays the scales of justice we know exactly what his motivations are, he feels he has been unfairly punished and wants to get even. Nolte's hero is a lot more flawed than your average Bennett Marco as his multiple infidelities are referenced and he becomes violent with this daughter at one point in the film, however this dynamic works and Scorsese makes insightful points about morality by changing the nature of the characters. He does in some ways conform to the 1960s template, horrifying villain with morally based motivations, but he also updates the formula for an early 90s audience with a more relatable hero who makes fatal mistakes but is also desperate to protect his family.\n\nThe Wesley Strick screenplay moves along nicely and has the sort of dramatic, expository arguments written into it that a film in this genre needs whilst also providing some interesting character features. In the original film the character equivalent for Danielle was called Nancy and she played little to no role in the film's plot or exploration of themes. Here she is attracted to Cady because of the danger that comes with the sexuality of a man whom her parents don't just dislike but immensely fear. During the infamous thumb-sucking scene she is convinced by Cady to rebel against her parents just as Cady has rebelled against society and this has to in some ways be an extreme example of a sexual awakening as the innocent and pure daughter is tainted by a dangerous man. Without differences like this the film would feel as though it were just an homage or even a parody instead it stands on it's own and contains really fascinating exploration of the psyche of young women in relation to their own sexuality.\n\nDe Niro and Nolte are the ideal casting choices in their roles and the ingÃ (C)nue Juliette Lewis manages to steal the show as the promiscuous Danielle. De Niro looks dangerous and his delivery of threats even in an over baked southern accent is menacing. Nolte has the power to be at once likable but also hugely flawed as was seen in The Prince of Tides (1991), he uses his charisma but also his weakness here to create an engrossing lead character. Lewis is captivating as the initially sweet and innocent daughter who can't help being annoyed by her parents overprotectiveness and sexually attracted to the man she shouldn't want, she pulls this transformation off and it is a wonder she didn't win all of the major awards. Lange is in my opinion weak but I have never had a particular affinity for her and have always found her breathy voice and airs difficult to watch. Robert Mitchum, who played Cady in the 1962 version, and Gregory Peck, in his final film role, pop up in small parts and bring their gravitas and allure to the production.\n\nI would recommend this film to fans of psychological thrillers in particular but most audiences in general looking for an exciting watch that goes deeper than most thrillers in the philosophical questions that it asks. De Niro gives yet another great performance as a super-villain and Nolte and Lewis are superb rounding out a thrilling cast that brings to mind the ensembles of yesteryear. Certainly not required viewing but an absorbing diversion that proved that Scorsese could work across most genres, we'll forget about that musical. This is second-rate Scorsese but it's still good enough for twelfth on my overall ranking.",

Enfolding layer after layer, the screenplay just keeps giving you back the thrills that were promised. Armed with such a buoyant script Scorsese is surprisingly chalky on terms of execution. With eerie camera work and ear numbing explosions blazing across the screen, the film makes you uncomfortable not significantly, but in its inadequacy to stay true to its tone. Brimmed with smart tricks to overpower each other on screen, Nolte and De Niro may not get a better role than this to go mano-y-mano on screen. From conversations to physical sequences, this meticulous script may have written people pleasing entertainment all over it, but there also resides a layered illuminating concept that is vivid enough to recite Bible and other mythological ideologies.\n\nMutilating every aspect of Nolte's possession; personal and professional, De Niro is on the podium with a sensational speech on mind and performance on his body language. Among many sharp encounters of his with multiple characters, the most riveting is the one he shares with Lewis. The entire conversation is a build up and the gist of the film itself, his rage that masks the entire screen to honesty is a testament to his majestic performance.\n\nWalking parallel-y Nolte is a convincing flawed human whose family is at risk and even though he never gets to score on De Niro's level, his own resistance towards the concept of life and death is intriguing. Lewis and Lange are too impressive on their supporting role, especially the brattiness of Lewis and her gullible nature that denses up the storytelling. Scorsese fails to picturize the explicit writing on screen that every now and then raises questions. Cape Fear is through and through on clearly depicting the concept, the fear is genuinely felt by us.",

Martin Scorsese's remake of the 1962 film (which was, in turn, an adaptation of a John D. MacDonald novel), does some fascinating things with the material.  Most notably, in the original film, Robert Mitchum's character is thoroughly villainous and Gregory Peck's character is heroic and upstanding.  Nothing is quite so clear cut here.  Nolte is not only guilty of professional misconduct, but he's a generally weak and unlikeable man.  While De Niro is a terrifying psychotic, he's a terrifying psychotic who makes more than a little sense at times.  He's a sort of angel of vengeance who strips everything away from Nolte, turning him and his family into savages, before Nolte can come out the other side.  Scorsese supports this theme by shooting a lot of the film like the kind of heightened, melodramatic thrillers one gets from directors like John Frankenheimer.  He also shoots for the very first time in a 2.35:1 ratio. uses an Elmer Bernstein arrangement of Bernar Herrmann's score from the original film, and has a title sequence designed by Saul Bass.

When going through my DirecTV list, I saw that this movie is in the bottom and had been there for probably a year or so, and I wanted to watch this to be done with it so that I can finally delete it. So for that matter, let's get to the matter of why I like it, but don't think it's one of the director's bests. The acting is great, especially Robert De Niro as the villain as he is intimidating, while also acting charming and innocent that you can see how people can be fooled by him. The style at first really caught me off guard and I wasn't quite sure whether I like it, but it doesn't do it that much, and it does fit into the film, even if I wasn't on board with it at first. The writing by Wesley Strick is not that bad as there are smart moments from the villain, but that's only because the main characters do so much dumb stuff that it's a miracle that they weren't in a more horrible situation until the end. The direction is really good, and the characters are decent at best. The climax is the best part of the film as it's a different setting that I usually see in a thriller, and it's the only times that the characters actually do something smart. As a remake, it's better than I expect, and with a talented director, you expect something that's actually trying to be a good movie, which this is in all actuality, but not as great as Cape Fear wanted to be.",

Out of context, all of these things are the staples of one legendary director: Alfred Hitchcock. With Cape Fear, these attributes are applied as an homage to Hitchcock via another legendary director: Martin Scorsese.\n\nThe film, a remake of the 1962 film, which itself drew many inspirations from Hitchcock, takes Scorsese into horror/thriller territory, a genre he has rarely covered, to mostly impressive success. The real reason the film is so unsettling is due to the Oscar nominated performance from Robert De Niro in his seventh collaboration with Scorsese. The way De Niro jumps back and forth from seemingly innocent to absolute psychopath as he manipulates his way into the Bowden family is absolutely creepy, and is handled as well as you'd expect from someone like De Niro. The rest of the performers here, including fellow Oscar nominee Juliette Lewis, Nick Nolte, and Jessica Lange, are all solid too, but there's no stealing the show from De Niro.\n\nCape Fear isn't without its problems though. As the story progresses, this story makes a sharp turn from a somewhat grounded one to one that is borderline comedic in presentation, which creates a huge tonal inconsistency. If it was intentional, as a kind of gesture to how absurd these kinds of stories can be, it's not a bad decision, but the fact that it's hard to tell isn't a good sign. And while it comes with the story and the themes Scorsese is conveying here, Nolte's Sam Bowden is sometimes hard to relate to, and lacks the kind of characterization that makes you want to root for him.\n\nAs a whole, it's not Scorsese's most refined work, but is a thrilling time with lots of tense moments and an expectedly great turn from De Niro to cap it all off.",

However though, mostly shot masterfully and creatively, the tricks expressed can be exhausting and confusing from the next frame that you'll be scratching head wondering if something was either cut or misheard, even when it's serving that exact purpose. Still, this is a Marty Scorsese flick. His mastery of filmmaking is crafted like a new human being that lives and breathes. His attention to using old school camera tricks with his amazing editing partner, Thelma Schoonmaker, and the late cinematographer Freddie Francis, create a new - old style.",

            "content": "This will be a comparison review of both the 1962 version and the 1991 Martin Scorsese remake.\n\nI'm going to break this review down in a couple of parts, reviewing/comparing both versions in some basic catagories, like story, characters, performances, editing, music, and cinematography.\n\n\nSTORY/WRITING\n\nBoth movies have a very similar story: (as expected with a remake) A convicted criminal, released from prison after serving a sentence, stalks the family of the lawyer who was involved in the case. Only with the 1962 version Max Cady is a criminal who was put in jail for assault, and in the 1991 version Cady is a rapist. The sentence Cady serves in the 1962 version was 8 years, and 14 years in the 1991 version. (i dont know why this was altered. Also, quite a major plot point that was changed is that in the 1962 version Bowden testified against Cady as a witness to put him behind bars, and in the 1991 version Bowden was the one who defended Cady but failed. I personally think how it is done in the 1991 version is better, because that adds another level of psychotic behavior to Cady (because why would you go after someone who tried to defend your case, it's a bit more psychotic), however in the 1962 version it's more realistic. Talking about realism, the 1962 version is overall much more probable than the 1991 version, but because it's a bit unrealistic the 1991 version is more terrifying, Cady is almost a superhero in the 1991 version. (Which could be a con for some, but for me, it's a pro). The 1962 version is more realistic because it explains almost every action Cady does, and puts sense behind his action. (which deletes the element of surprise)Also, the 1991 version has a lot of added scenes that aren't in the original, which could be bad, but most of the scenes that were added, are some of my favorite scenes from the remake, which was a shame they were nowhere to be found in the original.(Like the relationship sequences between Cady and Bowden's daughter, Cady dressing up as their maid, and the planned assault on Cady by Bowden, which was an incredibly smart (what came after it by Cady) and thrilling sequence in the remake) The first act is pretty much the same, both version set up the characters properly, and the scenes are very similar. The second act is very different with added and deleted scenes, and the final act of the remake is much longer and much more climactic than the remake, in the original it's only a brief sequence, but in the remake it's a bit longer, and Cady does a lot more terrifying and psychotic things than in the original.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nIn the 1991 version Max Cady looks alot more menacing. He's psychically ripped, he has tattoos, his hair is combed slick. In the 1962 version he just looks like a normal dude. The motives of Cady is slightly different in both versions. In the 1962 version Bowden testified against Cady as a witness to put him behind bars, and in the 1991 version Bowden was the one who defended Cady but failed. So the motives are a little different, but doesnt make either version better, both are pretty much the same and both are great. In the 1991 version Cady does a lot more terrifying acts, in the original Cady is just a stalker and does barely anything except being in close proximity of the Bowden family, but in the remake Cady is a lot more active in harassing the family. (Both version include Cady killing the Bowden family's dog). \nSam Bowden is character wise, pretty much the same in either version, the performances differ, but the character is the same. The main character differences are Sam's wife and daughter. In the remake both have a much bigger role (which is a good thing) \nThe wife is more actively involved in the story than just being there to scream and be scared. \nThe daughter has a short relationship with Cady in the middle of the film (wich adds creepiness) and she also is more actively involved with the story.\n\nPERFORMANCES\n\nMax Cady is much more terrifying in the 1991 version, beautifully portrayed by Robert De Niro, but he is almost overacting how intense Cady is in this version. But man, just his accent alone. DeNiro truly shows another side of himself as Cady. He is so incredibly terrifying, but that's also because Cady in the 1991 version does alot more things and is much more active than in the 1962 version. However, Mitchum ALSO portrays Cady beautifully, in a more realistic way. Mitchum portrays him like Cady is just a normal dude who wants to fuck with the guy who testified against him. Both portray Cady fantastically, but since the movie is about a character who is supposed to be terrifying, i have to go with De Niro's performance. \nSam Bowden, i was quite disappointed with Gregory Peck's performance. he is such a great actor (To Kill A Mockingbird!) but in this version he only has one emotion, he is constantly frowning and his face doesnt show any other emotion throughout the film. However, Nick Nolte gives a fantastic performance in Scorsese's version showing a range of emotions and state of mind. \nSam's wife, since in the remake Sam's wife has a much bigger role, and isnt screaming constantly, i have to go with Jessica Lange's performance. She is great, and much more involved.\nSam's Daughter, despite being much more involved in the remake, i have to go with Lori Martin's performance, simply because Lewis's is so incredibly annoying in the remake, i cant stand her character.\n\nEDITING\n\nThe original is quite slow, and that's mainly because of the laid-back editing style, and the amount of pointless scenes. (not that many, but a couple).\nThe remake is a much more slick, fast paced, well-rounded and entertaining version of this fantastic story.\n\nMUSIC/SCORE\n\nThe remake has quite an unmemorable score, and the original however features yet another fantastic score by Bernard Hermann (Citizen Kane, Taxi Driver, Psycho). The score is so fantastic, that most scares are because of the score and not because of what's happening on screen. That's a pro score-wise, but a con-story wise.\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY/VISUALS/STYLE\n\nThe original is shot like any other movie from the 60's, nothing really special. The remake however has such a vivid, lavish visual style (As expected with a movie directed by Scorsese) that is impossible not to like. The cinematography is impeccable too.\n\n\nCOMPARISON OVERVIEW:\n\nWriting: it's up to what you like, the original is much more realistic, but the remake is much more entertaining and interesting. Personally i have to go with the remake\nCharacters: Again, it's whatever you like, in the original the characters are more realistic and bit more fleshed-out, but in the remake the characters are more interesting and intense/terrifying (Cady) Personally i have to go with the remake\nPerformances: Despite great in both version, Peck's performance not being that great, i have to go with the remake.\nEditing: Remake without a doubt. It's much more fast-paced and entertaining. It also decided to leave out some of the pointless scenes the original has.\nScore: the original without a doubt. Hermann's score is absolutely fantastic.\nCinematography: The remake has such vivid visual style, it's impossible not to love.\n\nFINAL SUMMARY\n\nI dont say this often, but i thought the remake was much better. (I know i'm in the minority, i just didnt have many problems witht the remake, and i did have some with the original)\nDe Niro's performance was just incredible, despite being over the top, the movie was much more compact and fast paced, which resulted in making it an incredibly entertaining film, that's also great.\n\nCape Fear (1962): 3.5/5\nCape Fear (1991): 4.5/5",

Although Scorsese's technique is more proficient and he brings psychological dimensions to the story that were not present in the original film, this is still a shallow, impersonal thriller with a disappointingly conventional morality where the usual themes of sin and redemption become redundant. Robert De Niro is a psychopathic ex-con, recently paroled, who terrorizes the family of his attorney (Nick Nolte) for his perceived unethical legal performance. Scorsese and screenwriter Wesley Strick quote Biblical passages and invent scenarios for the hero to appear more and more helpless to set us up for an inflated horror movie climax that undermines all credibility. De Niro has greasy hair and is covered in tattoos to appear more menacing, yet the character exists solely to get under the skin of the hero and the audience. There is no suggestion of guilt, remorse, or regret with the character - he's a cartoon villain meant to antagonize and that's how De Niro plays the role. Nolte expresses his character's frustration and impotence with great intensity; Jessica Lange brings some sexual dynamism to an underwritten role as Nolte's estranged wife; Juliette Lewis shows a brazen ambiguity in her mannerisms of a confused and curious teenager; Ileana Douglass has the eccentric presence of a Shelley Duvall as Nolte's flirtatious colleague. Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck, who starred together in the original film, make cameo appearances. Saul Bass supplied the titles. Leonard Bernstein composed the score from Bernard Herrmann's original. With Joe Don Baker and Fred Thompson.",

I have seen both, and you can see where Martin Scorsese got the idea, obviously, and the original was very good, too, but this takes it to a whole new level. \n\nFirstly, we are talking about a revenge movie here. Robert De Niro plays Max Cady, this guy fresh out of prison who has served his time learning the law and discovering that his defence attorney hid crucial evidence that could have reduced his sentence or acquitted him in his trial for rape. Now let the fun begin as he finds his defense attorney, Nick Nolte, on the outside and his beautiful car, and his beautiful house, and his beautiful wife, and his beautiful little girl...\n\nI mean your hands physically squeeze at the loathing grin on Max Cady's face when he confronts Nick Nolte with a paper bag of groceries outside the store, and Nick Nolte doesn't recognise him 'after all the years'. Can you feel where this is going yet? Don't worry, Max Cady has time, plenty of time. He's outside after all now, and free as the next man to reflect on all that time that he wasn't free because this som-ov-a-witch stitched him up and has been living the nice life all this time. De Niro reeks lascivious malice with a hungerful appetite unlike anything you have ever seen before.\n\nA starving wolf couldn't want a tiny sliver of that flesh more. And you look at shaky and guilty Nicky Nolte and you just KNOW he is going to get his comeuppance. It's like the inevitable inevitable written on a bill board coming at you as fast as a runaway train!\n\nBut De Niro dallies and teases you with it like a cat playing with a fragile bird to prolong the fun at watching its pain and anguish.\n\nDirected by Martin Scorsese, who also directed another film in this list, King of Comedy, it is also an unacknowledged masterpiece. It is not for the faint-hearted and it is also not for children under 16, and the ending will leave you on the end of your seat, or behind it!\n\n- See more at: http://www.principalegg.com/reviews/review-of-the-top-10-most-paranoid-movies-of-all-time/#sthash.an2cdopN.dpuf",

It's about a convicted rapist fresh out of prison who is taunting/stalking and messing around with a lawyer. His own defence lawyer none the less, who he believes has done him wrong. The directing in the film is great and it was nice to see Martin Scorsese doing a different type of thriller, some camera angles and the way things are shot really remind me of movies like Psycho and help build suspense in the film along with the violent scenes seeming a lot more realistic. What made this film even better is Robert de Niro. I'm used to seeing him play the part of a gangster in movies, which don't get me wrong I love, but in this film he is brilliant and most of all you actually feel the suspense and threat that his character is imposing on the lawyers family. The only thing that lets this movie down for me is the last fifteen minutes which to me feel rushed along with some of the acting been a little too over the top; the film could have been wrapped up a lot better. The suspense should have carried on!\n\nThis movie is still an awesome film showing the brilliant talent de Niro has as a actor and Scorsese as a director.

No offense, Mitchum. His performance transcends every other aspect of a film that with any other actor could be considered mediocre, and makes it the Robert DeNiro show. He is the perceived antagonist targeting his former lawyer who discarded viable evidence that could have led to dismissal, and is dead set on making him pay his dues. Cady is a stark villain that remains in the shadows and is always two steps ahead of his more sophisticated targets who dismiss his credibility upon the first glance of his tacky attire and boisterous presence. This is to his advantage, and the entire movie revolves around Cady making his lawyer, played by a believable Nick Nolte, miserable by any means necessary. Certain scenes were wrought with tension, particularly one that takes place between DeNiro and Juliette Lewis. Scorcese does a fine job walking the razor's edge, however, heigtening the intensity in nearly every scene involving the ripped, tatted DeNiro. This, a remake of a supposed classic, is a rare example of a stylistic reimagining that outshines its predecessor. Definitely worth watching.",

However during this transitional period of the film, many aspects of the movie are not justified at all which seems very uncharacteristic of Scorsese and his style but so is the tone of the movie itself. \nOn the acting front, De Niro comes up with an incredible performance and so does all the others such as Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis. \nDespite the obvious flaws in the film, its still an enthralling experience for the most part with some incredible shots which left me puzzled on how they pulled it off. \nDefinitely worth a watch despite the flaws.",

Nick Nolte, one of my favs definitley lives up to DeNiro as well as the part originally played by Gregory Peck, and DeNiro playing the role eventually played by the great Robert Mitchum, but until recently I never saw the original and truthfully I like Scorsese's version better. Not because it's Scorsese and DeNiro, but because I have watched this movie for as long as I can remember that after getting so use to this movie, that the original was kind of.....ok. But I understand that the original is going to be different, but I just couldn't get into it the way I could with the remake, but I do understand why the original is a classic. But it the Scorsese/DeNiro version that really sticks out among the original and that is because of DeNiro, the way he's dressed, his hair, the tattoos, everything. Watching DeNiro in movies like this, \"Raging Bull,\" \"Goodfellas of course, \"Taxi Driver\", and so forth and so on make me realize why DeNiro is still one of my favorite actors of all time even though he hasn't done a good movie since I think \"Meet the Parents,\" but I understand every actor has their bump in the road in their career. Juliette Lewis always reminds of how surprisingly good she is as well in this movie as Nick Nolte's daughter, cause when I think of the movie I generally think of Nolte and DeNiro in a Scorsese film, but Juliette Lewis come through as well in this film. My aunt's girlfriend told me when we watched this movie during Christmas break that the scene between Lewis and DeNiro in the theater class downstairs alone, and the way DeNiro talks to her and then starts kissing her is worse than him having sex with them in this film, and you know something she is right, but hey...that's good acting.",

Worry that it won't be what I remembered it to be, worry that it won't stand up all these years later, or worry that a favorite director might look a little less great in hindsight. So when I was looking through a collection of films from the great Martin Scorsese and realized I had never sat down and watched a full screening of Cape Fear you can understand my reluctance to tackle the challenge of an objective review.  However my fears were short lived, for within the first few frames of the film you realize that this is again Scorsese at the top of his game.  \nWith a plot and setting that truly do seem out of place for a Scorsese picture it would be easy to dismiss this as nothing particularly special.  And, in fact, I am sure that is large part of why I took so long to get around to it.  Growing up the only exposure I ever had to this film was glimpses I saw on TV every once and a while.  Glimpses which, if seen out of context, could lead to one writing it off.  Even during this latest viewing I was joined by my roommate, who, after watching ten minutes of out of context Nolte dialogue, decided to take a pass on watching any more.  But if you really watch the film and not just what the characters are doing, I think you will come to truly appreciate what it is.\nIt really is a treat to see a director who actual directs.  Whose camera angles are deliberate and whose cuts actually serve the structure of the film.  Too often we are bombarded with copy-paste films, where the camera is arbitrarily placed in a scene with no context or reasoning.  It is especially unique to see it in a film of this genre.  Real filmmaking is truly going out of style.\nApart from the incredible work by Scorsese are the characters themselves.  What sets them apart is how atypical they are.  There is no black and white, good vs evil set up here.  Instead everyone lies in a shade of grey.  And while DeNiro's villain plays fairly close to the typical psychotic villainous territory, the remainder of the cast allows for some ambiguity among the audience.  In nearly all films of this genre, you know who the good guy is and you always want him to win.   You want him to defeat the bad guy in a resounding way and have a heartfelt reunion with his family.   Such is not the case here.  And perhaps it's just me, and perhaps it's just my subconscious desire to see DeNiro win in any film he's in (I also wanted him to win in Heat), but I found myself not only rooting for the villain, but also against the 'hero'.  Although in retrospect, that could also be a result of 20 years of distain for the other actors in this film.  I'm looking at you Juliette Lewis, AKA film ruiner.  \nSo what else is there to say about this film?  It's Scorsese.  It's DeNiro.  It's not the best of Scorsese, maybe not even top 10, but it's pretty damn good.  7/10",

The film also feels cheesy and ridiculous at times with De Niro's character literally becoming an indestructible slasher movie villain at points, which is probably intentional but it does not always work, as it often robs the film of its believability. I would still recommend it but it does not hold a candle to some of Scorsese's other work in my opinion.\nB",

He didnt scare me but the lengths that his character goes through just to torment this family is a terrifying watch! De Niro was outstanding here! Some of his best work. The southern voice sort of annoyed me at first, I just thought, 'why?' That seems to be the go-to accent in movies but then again, it made the character feel more real and the voice didnt go over the top and sound silly. De Niro has a very recognisable and distinctive face but even with that he makes the character his own, and, like I said, it was terrifying. Everyone else gave great performances too, especially Nick Nolte who acts like I've never seen him act before and it was refreshing and it was great to have that little cameo with Gregory Peck; that was a nice touch. But it's really pointless to name all the actors individually because they were all brilliant! Every. Single. One. Scorsese is a funny director, he never has a style or any quirks that you could tell that it was him who made the movie. I've seen a few films by him now and each one had its own look and feel to it but that just proves how great he is, this film had a very gritty feel which is, of course, the point  he's one of my favourite directors but I thought I should just mention it.

After serving fourteen tortuous years in a federal corrections facility, serial rapist Cady seeks to avenge his sentence by bugging the living fuck out of defense lawyer Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) and the rest of his immediate kin, wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis), fueled by the suspicion Sam withheld evidence that could maybe have led to Max's acquittal.\n\nOf all the Master of Suspense's not-so-humble imitators, the one Martin Scorsese's \"Cape Fear\" -- remaking J. Lee Thompson's 1962 film of the same name -- most resembles early on is Brian De Palma. In a beguiling sequence set at Sam's luxurious home, as the adult couple confront one another, Scorsese switches between a medium shot of Leigh talking and another when Sam does that appears as if the camera is inside the bathroom mirror, making the image accurately reflect \"Cape Fear's\" haunted atmosphere of the decidedly distant past impeding on the present. And in Sam's relationship too -- it's implied later on that outside of preeminently sending Max away, he also married Leigh as satisfying the means of making her repress the memory of his own prior infidelities.\n\nSymbolism abounds in \"Cape Fear\", as do larger questions -- was Sam exactly misguided in imprisoning Max, the big bad wolf encroached upon their comfy, domestic fairy tale? To protect his family, will a man hipper than most to the legal ramifications of taking the law into his own hands risk working around the judicial system he knows is broken? In my nearly post-2013 mindset (time's a bitch, ain't it) I'd relate the subdued feeling of \"Cape Fear\" to something akin to \"Prisoners\", and begrudgingly overseen by the targeted economic vise of \"The Counselor\". But never mind that. Point is, \"Cape Fear\" is a damn effective thriller, even on the occasion it opts for bluntness, bloat and cliche over a more narrow lethal precision. Scorsese presents the film's dual sides of noble and sinful sadism as a mask, not evil Max's but that of the dowry Sam; the sinking realization that the criminal interrogation room only stays one-sided for so long before festering comes home to roost. (84/100)",

The lawyer obtains evidence that his client's victim was with several men that night, any of them could be responsible for the murder...but the lawyer knows he did it, so he buries the evidence.  The man goes to jail for fourteen years and is eventually released.  Upon release, he will stop at nothing to obtain revenge on his lawyer for not doing his best to keep him out of jail.\n\n\"What are we talking about?\"\n\"Two pieces of pipe and a bicycle chain.\"\n\nMartin Scorsese, director of Goodfellas, Casino, The Departed, Taxi Driver, Aviator, Shutter Island, Hugo, Raging Bull, Boxcar Bertha, Mean Streets, and the upcoming The Wolf of Wall Street, delivers Cape Fear.  The storyline for this picture is very gripping and dramatic.  The film is delivered in the perfect gritty fashion needed for this plot and the acting is outstanding.  The cast includes Robert De Niro, Nick Nolte, Juliette Lewis, Jessica Lang, Gregory Peck, and Joe Don Baker. \n\n\"I don't know whether to look at him or read him.\"\n\nCape Fear is a movie I saw as a kid and remembered thinking it was just okay.  Watching it again as an adult I can tell you that I am thoroughly impressed by the intensity of this film.  De Niro delivers a mesmerizing performance.  My only complaint about this film is the conclusion seems a bit overdone and too drawn out.  I do really like this movie, but it wouldn't make my top 5 Scorsese or De Niro pictures.  This is good enough to add to your DVD collection and is a must see for both De Niro and Scorsese fans.\n\n\"Every man has to go through hell to reach his paradise.\"\n\nGrade: B+/A- (8.25)",

The film is full of clichés and ultimately takes out a majority of the suspense even though it is still there. If you have even seen the episode of the Simpsons that parodies this then you know the basis of the ending but of course the film goes into much more detail and drama.\n\nFor me the two standout performances are form De Niro and Juliette Lewis. De Niro was his usual brilliant self but should how well he could play psychotic and likeable until the rape scene. Lewis should a vulnerability and rebelliousness that is in complete contradiction. It is no surprise that she got an Oscar nomination for her performance. The only performance that I did not like was from Jessica Lange who played the usual vulnerable female role that does nothing except for scream. \n\nThe direction style was the usual Scorsese style with drama with bits of violent action in between. The problem that I did have was with Scorsese putting up the random colours on the screen which I think was meant to come off as stylish but came across as unnecessary. This may just be because I am watching it 22 years after it was originally released.\n\nOverall the film had brilliant performances but felt predictable and unnecessary colours put on the screen.",

In Scorsese's Cape Fear, De Niro arrives at the scene bombastically with no sense of waiting and tension. This film is a prime example of what happens when you don't follow the good ol' \"less is more\" rule.",

Updating the story form the early 1960s version, most viewers today will find it solid entertainment, depending upon their tolerance for an incredibly overblown story and enough unpleasantness to make even the strongest viewers wince on a consistent basis.\nRobert DeNiro puts on his gritty face once again to play Max Cady in this gruesome yet entertaining flick. A psychic rapist recently released after fourteen years behind bars, he can think of nothing he would rather do than seek revenge on the lawyer (Nick Nolte) who failed to get him off the hook. Now traveling with his wife and teenage daughter to Cape Fear, he (along with many unfortunate others) is in to realize this place was not given its name by coincidence.\nMartin Scorcese directs yet another turgid film and once again casts DeNiro (who previously acted for him in Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas) who plays his part to perfection and brings a new meaning to the term \"unsettling\" among others. Additionally, Bernard Herrmann's composing talents fit in here just as well as they did in Psycho. But considering the excellent production unit, it's too bad they had to loose some of their credibility when the story goes so far into absurdity that some could swear they are watching a typical horror flick. Could we not rise above this, Martin?\nOf all Scorcese films, this one is bound to produce the most thrills and chills which last from start to finish. Though it never wants to end (especially the climax part), it's pretty solidly entertaining above all and is worth a view for all movie buffs. Watch for some cameos including Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam who all appeared in the 1962 original.",

The cinematography and colour saturation contributes to building a very intense atmosphere and De jjNiro's performance as the violent but intelligent criminal is among his most haunting.",

The original is great. Just because it can be made, doesn't mean it should be. Critics losing their mind over another Scorsese picture featuring De Niro also doesn't benefit this otherwise average outing. I ask anyone: If neither Scorsese and De Niro were involved and the film was otherwise the same (Nolte, Lange and Lewis intact), would there still be the acclaim there is for it?

            "content": "Martin Scorcese's filmography as director is one of the most accomplished in modern film history. While Cape Fear can't even hold a candle next to \"Taxi Driver\", \"Raging Bull\" and \"Goodfellas\", it is still a good remake of the 1962 noir classic and it keeps the viewer on the edge right through until the closing credits.Robert De Niro (in yet another brilliant teaming with Scorcese behind the camera) plays Max Cady, a psychopathic rapist who was sent to jail 14 years earlier for such crimes. He leaves prison with vengeance. Not for his victims or his prosecutor, but his defence councillor, Sam J. Bowden, played by Nick Nolte. It seems Bowden did not defend Cady to the best of his ability. Cady knows this and wants some payback.Cady's initial return into Bowden's life could not have come at a worse time. Bowden has been forced to move his family to Florida after his infidelities threatened his marriage and career. His wife is distrustful and worst of all, Bowden is on the verge of beginning another affair with a female workmate. Added to that, his daughter is at the difficult age of 15.Almost by ozmosis, Cady understands these problems in the Bowden household and acts on them. He begins terrorising Bowden and his whole family, taking it from one extreme to the next.What makes Cape Fear a good film is the rapidly increasing sense of claustrophobia. Scorcese makes a point of using almost only close up shots towards the end of the film. It is a great touch that makes the viewer that much more scared as the film goes on.Along with that, Robert De Niro is superb as Cady. Only occasionally does the role slip into parody. Mostly he is expertly evil.Nick Nolte is good if not great, the same for Jessica Lange as Leigh Bowden. It seems as if they were void of any great lines in this film, which is unfortunate given their immense talent. Julliette Lewis is absolutely brilliant as the young daughter, Danielle. She slips effortlessly between curious sexual awakenings, rebellious teen and straight thinking woman. Add in small roles for Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck (the leads of the 1962 version) and you have a great ensemble cast.So not the best Scorcese film ever, but some tight editing, great camerawork, a haunting theme and devilishly over-the-top acting help make this a frighteningly fun movie to watch.

            "content": "Martin Scorsese is a director that has a massive reputation on the sub-genre of gangster movies but he's never really been known to tackle a specific genre itself. Due to a contractual obligation with Universal studios and the encouragement of friends Robert DeNiro and Steven Spielberg (who was originally supposed to be the director), he decided to go ahead with this 1991 horror/thriller, making it his first genre and Hollywood movie and also his first remake.\n After 14 years in prison, psychopath Max Cady (Robert DeNiro) is released where he begins to seek revenge on his former lawyer Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte). He believes that Bowden deliberately held back a report during his trial that would have saved him doing time and vows to make Bowden's life a living hell by terrorising him and his family.\n The original Cape Fear was released in 1962 and Scorsese makes great references to it. He employs the original actors Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck and Martin Balsam in cameo roles and has Elmer Bernstein adapt the Hitchcokian original score by Bernard Herrmann. Despite the courteous regard to the original though, Scorsese makes this film his own and updates the material for a contemporary audience by using a more layered approach. He delivers more of a backstory and questions the ethical and moral history of not just DeNiro's character but also Nolte's. As we are introduced to them, Nolte's Sam Bowden dresses in pastel coloured suits and exudes an air of righteousness and innocence while DeNiro's Max Cady is a cigar chomping, tattooed brute. All is not exactly black and white between them though and there's also tension and discord between Sam and his long suffering wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and their awkward teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). Meanwhile, a manipulative and calculating Cady gets his revenge by using the conflicts within the family. By delving more into his characters, Scorsese skilfully cranks up the tension and with superb production design by Henry Bumstead and marvellous cinematography by Freddie Francis he manages to create a real sense of claustrophobia within the family household. While everyone are doing their job behind the scenes though, the ones in front are delivering some of their career best performances. The entire cast deliver the goods here; Nolte and Lange's on-edge, afflicted couple couldn't be better and a young - Oscar nominated - Juliette Lewis is a revelation as the awkward, self-conscious impressionable teenager. However, despite these excellent deliveries, this is DeNiro's film. He is absolutely outstanding and delivers a character that is amongst the finest of his career and another highly impressive transformation; his physique is in exceptional peak condition (apparently he brought his body fat down to 3%) and he has a creepy southern accent that just rings in your ears. The foreboding and malevolent presence that DeNiro shows is deeply unsettling and he, like Lewis, also received an Oscar nomination. Personally, I hold the opinion that he should have taken the award that year. He's such a threatening character and one of cinema's most frightening.\n The only major problem I had with the film was the denouement. It veers heavily into formulaic territory and despite it sharing the themes of a horror movie, the ending is just a bit too far. For the most part though, Scorsese's audacity pays off and it's an highly admirable addition to his impressive canon.\n It may lack the subtlety of the original and if it wasn't for the extreme horror denouement, this film would be worthy of a rating higher than the 4 stars I've given it. That being said, it's still one of the most powerful and memorable performances that DeNiro has ever produced.",

At first the stalking starts off rather innocently, which gradually becomes more and more threatening. Bowden is a man with family problems, his relationship with his wife is distant and \nhis daughter Danielle can also be hard to communicate with; so all the stalking doesn't help. \n I liked the film, but some of the pacing felt off at times. It was pretty interesting, and it uses the theme of revenge quite nicely; and it had a nice narrative when it was used.  It's enjoyable, and I didn't really get bored.\nThere isn't a thrill a minute, but it can be very thrilling, and it sure is creepy. The most thrills are during the finalé on the river. \n For a thriller it's relatively weak in some areas, but not the weakest I have ever seen, and it's still pretty enjoyable. I'm not sure how great of a remake it is as I haven't seen the original, but it was a pretty great film if it stood on its own. \n For a Martin Scorsese film though, it is probably his weakest I've seen, but that doesn't by any means imply it's bad because he is such a great filmmaker. It has good direction and a great Oscar nominated leading performance by Robert De Niro. It doesn't have a great rewatchability factor, but I'd sure give the original a watch. \n The film stars Robert De Niro, he really steals the show in this as the hideously creepy Cady, Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, Juliette Lewis, Joe Don Baker, Illeana Douglas, Robert Mitchum (the original Max Cady) as Lieutenant Elgart, and Gregory Peck (the original Sam Bowden) as the lawyer Lee Heller. \n It's a gripping and engaging film, often enough, and it sure is an efficient and a really great one-time thrill ride. \n\n                                                          75/100",

I did remember most of the plot, some scenes that at the time I found particularly disturbing and Martin Scorcese's nervous direction. So, how does it hold up? \nIn spite of some plot holes and outdated tricks labelled 90's, it is still pretty intense and frightening.\nI would say the biggest assets of the movie is Robert de Niro as psycho Max Cady, creeping into this family's life to torn it apart. He is charming, he is smart but the lunatic holds grudges and swore to get revenge. I think the most disturbing scene is when he pretends to be the daughter's drama teacher, meets her in an empty theatre and the movie drops a pedo-bomb on us.\nI talked about some plot holes. For example Sam (Nick Nolte), knowing this guy is a threat but never showing a mugshot to his family so they can recognize him and stay away. But above all, the last ten minutes take a bizarre turn of event with a weird scene where Cady pleads to the camera. His final death is also borderline ridiculous.\nThe tricks labelled 90's would be this weird effect of reversed black and white color then fading to red that doesn't really make any sense but most of all, the annoying shrill music. \nDespite those little things, the movie holds up pretty well after 20 years.",

A creepy sensuality pervades this film, especially with respect to Danielle, the teenage daughter. All the characters shine under Scorsese's direction (even Peck and Mitchum appear) but DeNiro operates at another plain entirely. Like his characters in their earlier collaborations Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, DeNiro's Cady is unforgettable. \r\n\r\n1991's Cape Fear is a cat and mouse game, operating like the 1962 film hopped up on steroids. There is more of everything: sex, violence, plot twists, shocks, but especially guilt and manipulation. This Sam Bowden and his family are severely flawed, and this Max Cady is understandably mad, but to what extent is his violence justified? I cannot say that this seventh of eight collaborations between Scorsese and DeNiro is their best, but it is DeNiro's most terrifying",

I mean the film may not be as remembered without it being directed by Scorsese, but than it also may not have been a good movie.  But this film sets up very well, giving a family, a story, and a villain who truly is the best part of the film.  Max Cady is a killing machine and a true psychopath, and his persistance and motivations make him one of the most memorable villains in cinema, from either this or the old version.  Robert DeNiro plays his perfectly and its great to see him play more of a psychopath rather than his usual roles.  Nick Nolte is also great and really rises the tension of the situation, and Juliette Lewis really carried a strong and great role that I think she handled perfectly.  The script is great, the cast is great, but what kept the film from being perfect was that it was a remake, and we must compare it to the original which makes it truly hard to look at it as a masterpiece.

They make no attempts to soften their characters and their arguements and interactions feel particularly real as a result. The film really does belong to De Niro and Juliette Lewis.

Talvez uma obra-menor dentre os filmes de Martin Scorsese ('Taxi Driver', 'Touro Indomável', 'Os Bons Companheiros, 'Os Infiltrados'), 'Cabo do Medo' é um ensaio metafórico da insignificância do ser-humano, dos seus pecados, suas fraquezas, falhas de caráter, presunção, hipocrisia e, como o título do filme destaca, o medo. Da loucura à sensação constante de perseguição, dos cortes bruscos à inocência que beira o \"non-sense\" da adolescente interpretada por Julliette Lewis, da trilha pulsante ao contraponto de olhares, caras e bocas de Robert De Niro (excepcionalmente \"possúido\") e Nick Nolte, além da angústia e descaso da personagem de Jessica Lange. 'Cabo do Medo' pode não ser o filme da carreira de Scorsese, entretanto mesmo assim é muito mais filme do que tantos títulos que também exploram a pequenês humana.

            "content": "Although this is not a bad film, this is definitely nowhere near that level of Martin Scorsese's other great works. The way Scorsese tells the story is exactly something I can see in a 60's thriller film and he does this quite well. This film did a good job of presenting a very nice thriller, having this retro thriller presentation and giving plenty of detail and depth toward the characters. The best thing about the film, which really brought the thrills was watching Max Cady, portrayed by Robert De Niro, making the life of Sam, portrayed by Nick Nolte, and his family a living hell. Cady, completely changes the life of the family, making them fall apart and fear for this man. Another good thing about the film was how you actually see these changes and feeling the fear that the family is going through because of this man. It was a nice touch and Scorsese really did a good job of portraying these scenes. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to his films, Scorsese is very good at focusing on his characters, but the main issue with this film is the fact that he did this way too much, which may cause some people to lose some interest to the plot. I won't disagree with the fact that the film was well made and that there is nothing wrong with the plot, but it felt that the film focused way too much on the characters. The film portrays these changes that the family goes through really well, as you actually see them act differently and fear for their lives; however, I just can't help the fact that this caused the film to progress slowly. Rather than portraying these changes in a weekly or at least showing the important days, you see a daily life of the family, which personally, did cause the film to drag at certain points and really made the film go by slowly. Also, there were quite a few questionable scenes that just didn't fit for the film and caused the film to drag, the most being scenes involving the daughter.  I really don't know why, but I actually viewed the daughter as the weak point of the storyline; she was annoying, worthless and her appearance really caused the film to get boring. Every single time she appears on the screen, it wasn't exciting, it wasn't thrilling, nor important; her existence in the film didn't do much as of making the film interesting. What really helped boost up the entertainment of the film was the thrills brought from Cady. There are a decent amount presented, but you wished that somehow Scorsese would have combined the thrills with the character portrayals perfectly, making you excited but scared of what Cady will do next. The most thrilling parts were 30-40 minutes before the climax, as things get more serious with Cady going full throttle.\r\n\r\nAll of the thrills of this film comes from the actions committed by Cady. Cady wants vengeance and he will do everything that he can to pay back Sam, portrayed by Nick Nolte, for putting him in jail. As you see Cady make Sam's life miserable and unleashing his tactics, you will see how smart and intelligent Cady is. Every time Cady is on the screen, you will not know what he will do, wondering if he is going to go berserk or if he is playing things cool. Cady's action is mysterious, making it hard to predict any of his actions and making you fear him, giving you goosebumps as he appears; props to Scorsese for actually portraying this extremely well. Personally, this boosted up the interest toward the film and really makes up from the drag that was mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\nThe acting was well done and there were nothing wrong with the performances. Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange were all good as their roles as the husband and wife of the family members. For some reason, Juliette Lewis's performance in this film wasn't all that good. I liked her performance in other films, but personally, she wasn't all that good in this film. The one man who stole the show big time was none other than Robert De Niro. De Niro was actually quite menacing and plays out as this crazy, vengeful man extremely well. You fear Cady and you don't know what to think every time you see him on the screen. He is just an incredible actor and you can see that in this film; he actually nailed that southern accent along with his role.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely not one of Scorsese's best works, but he does present a good thriller with a very vicious villain. The pacing maybe off and there were definitely some scenes that were not needed, but paying close attention to the characters and wondering the next move of Cady will bring in the entertainment.",

Max Cady is definately one of the most terrifying characters in cinema, and his character was justified by the superb De Niro.\r\n\r\nThe Acting by the whole cast is superb, all the actors including Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange as the Lawyer and his wife and their daughter Danielle(Juliette Lewis) have done a great job in their roles and have really perfected the portrayel of their characters, BUT Robert De Niro really takes the cake with his portrayel of the Dangerous Psychopath Max Cady who is obsessed with taking revenge against the family of Sam Bowden(Nick Nolte) and De Niro has really imperfected the character through his extraordinary acting skills and deadly expressions and dialogue delivery and really scares the audience in many times.\r\n\r\nThe Direction by Martin Scorsese is as good as ever as he has yet again produced a master-piece with De Niro, and has done a magnificent job in making the movie. He Helped all the experienced actors give excellent performences in their respective roles and yet again has made De Niro give a superb performence under him and really has perfected in the other aspects of the film such as the Music, Direction in harsh areas. He Has really imperfected the use of the story and has made one of the best thrillers which will literally give you chills and with the help of his old friend De Niro and the other great actors, he really has added another gem to his treasury.\r\n\r\nThe Story of the movie which is based on the novel(The Executioners) written by John. D Macdonald, and the screenplay is done by James R Webb and Wesley Strick, is really great showing the obsession towards the family of this dangerous Psychopath who can literally do anything to make life miserable for the lawyers family, and great job to both the Author and the screen writers for doing such a fine job with the story.\r\n\r\nThe Music which is another Scorsese classic really sets the tone for the movie and really helps to the atmosphere of the movie with its chilling like music and great job from music directors Elmer Bernstein and Bernard Herrmann for doing such a fine job with the music for the movie.\r\n\r\nThis Movie really is one of the better thrillers in the history of Cinema, which will keep you at the edge of your chills,and De Niro's acting will ensure the chills to run down your spine, and Martin Scorsese just makes the even better with his marvelous direction as always and has made another superb movie.\r\n\r\nMy Rating: 8/10",

            "content": "This Martin Scorcese remake of the 1962 film with the same name directed by Lee Thompson is an intense thriller with Robert de Niro delivering an incredible performance as the ultimate villain. This film has Scorsese s usual touch in his direction, but it is not considered among his best works just because his other films were great classics such as Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Taxi Driver. Typical of a film directed by Scorcese, there is no heroe in this story. Nick Nolte is Bowden, a defense attorney who is threatened by the evil, scary, and witty Max Cady played to perfection by Robert De Niro. 14 years ago Bowden had defended Cady in a case where he had raped a young girl. Bowden, knowing that Cady was guilty withheld some important information from the case that would have liberated the redneck and ileterate Cady. During his time in prison Cady learned to read and decided to study law books and specifically his case. Finding Bowden guilty for not correctly defending him now that he is out of jail he decides to threaten his family in revenge. Cady is not stupid and he does everything with care so that the law cannot touch him. Nolte s character is flawed as is his entire family. This is not your typical movie where the heroe is a good moral man. This time around the heroe Bowden is dealing with family issues, with infidelities, and doing things outside the law in order to stop Cady threats. The other great performance in this film is by the young Juliette Lewis who plays Bowden s daughter. She locks herself in the room everytime her parents scream at each other (and that is often in the film even before Cady enters in the scene) and feels a certain dislike towards them. There is one intense scene where she meets Cady that is played with perfection and the dialogue is great. What stands out in this film is that the family is not a perfect one like in other movies, it has its flaws and issues that they are trying to deal with even before Cady atorments them. Bowden is seeking redemption and Cady knows Bowden is not such a good guy but the audience still feels for Bowden and his disfunctional family and wants them to be saved from this evil character. Scorsese knows what he is doing when creating interesting and dark characters and th film is an enjoyable one to watch full of thrills.",

            "content": "SPOOK-A-THON!\r\nOctober 2011\r\nREVIEW #:026\r\nMartin Scorsese's CAPE FEAR (remake) [1991]: in one of Scorsese's more interesting carrier moves, the great director chose to remake the classic 1962 film CAPE FEAR. Thankfully in the skilled hands of Scorsese this remake works well via his talent as a filmmaker and his homage to the original film. In this updated version the always superb Robert De Nero plays the villain Max Cady who is out of prison after his defence lawyer caused him to lose the trial called Sam Bowden. When Bowden learns of Cady been back in town and who is out for revenge, Bowden in a state of desperation tries to protect his wife and daughter from the sadistic Cady. However much like the original film the dramatic climax takes place on the Cape Fear River.\r\n \r\nOverall despite one or two draw backs that this film has, Scorsese's re-use of the original Bernard Hermann score, The brilliant performance from De Nero and the Use of cameo's by Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, this is one remake that isn't a letdown. My rating for this film is a solid 70%.",

            "content": "Directed by Martin Scorsese this is a remake of the original Cape Fear (1962) and while I admit I have never seen the original from start to finish, I thought this was one of the best films of the 90's. Cape Fear is a psychological thriller that is maybe a touch long at over two hours but entertains, has a good solid story, good character's and an edgy feel to it throughout. Most horror/suspense movies try to scare you with daunting music and vicious kill scenes. Cape Fear includes those aspects, but in a greater perspective.\n\nCape Fear takes place after the psychopath Max Cady, played by De Niro, is fresh out of prison after a long time. But there's a twist: Cady wants revenge on his lawyer Sam Bowden, acted by Nick Nolte, because Cady feels he wasn't defended the way he should have been. This triggers a fire in the ex-con and he wants revenge on Nolte. Along with his determination, Cady takes many brutal actions knowing that no matter what he does Bowden cannot defend his family from the animal.\n\nThere are so many great things about Cape Fear but the cast is where the film truly shines. DeNiro's performance is beautiful. His treacherously psychotic portrayal of the Cady character is unnerving and poignant in his struggle to bring Bowden to task. His self-righteous indignation at having been incarcerated for over a decade is one hundred percent believable, and the details down to the look in his eyes, are pure perfection. I find this role more memorable then his role as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. Nolte and Lange are good too as the uneasily married victims, while youngster Lewis is outstanding in her morally complex role as the misunderstood daughter of the family. The films supporting casts includes veterans in the original 1961 classic. Martin Balsam who played the cop in the original plays the judge; Robert Mitchum who played the villain plays the lead detective; and Gregory Peck who played the hero in the original plays Cady's attorney (in which he is dress like Atticus in \"To Kill A Mockingbird\") Though this is the first film that Scorsese has directed that is not part of his roots, the film is a classic of character study in which everybody is not what they seem to be, and to show that there are bad people who are innocent and good people who have flaws.\n\nCape Fear is held back from telling who really is the antagonist and protagonist. The Bowdens and Cady take matters into their own hands that may cause you to think all of them deserve to be in jail. It also may cause you to wonder if killing is ever needed.\n\nScorsese's take on the material is very much old-school and Alfred Hitchcock inspired. The original score from composer Bernard Herrman is left intact and helps push the mounting terror over the edge, making the film seem like a nightmare you just can't wake from. \"Cape Fear\" is, at its core, a chilling thriller where its characters spend most of the time desperate and frantic. They make bad choices that lead to an intense final act that has earned its place in Hollywood history. Truly an intense film about ugly characters delivered with a touch of class by its director and filled out with performances that range from great to legendary. If one thing can be said about this movie, it's that it will stay with you for a long time after watching it.",

An amazingly dynamic, raw and scary performance from DeNiro who plays his character brilliantly. A superbly constructed film , which may not be Scorsese at his best, but it is Scorsese at his second tier best, which is almost better than first tier everybody else. I advice this film highly for anybody who apprciates the sheer art in cinema.

            "content": "\"Cape Fear\" includes three of my favorite aspects of the film industry: Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, and thrillers as a genre.  Naturally, I was bound to like this movie.  It's a remake of a 1962 film of the same name, which was in turn based off a novel.  I don't know anything about those two, but Scorsese's version was extremely well acted, filmed, etc.  It is one of the reasons why the 22 year film partnership between Scorsese and De Niro never should have ended.  They did beautiful work together.  De Niro plays a rapist, Max Cady who has just been released from prison after 14 years.  Sometime in prison he went insane apparently and decides that he wants to stalk and kill his former lawyer, Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) and his wife (Jessica Lange) and daughter (Juliette Lewis).   It is revealed that Sam did not do all he could have to get his client off.  Robert De Niro is absolutely wonderful in this film.  He is such a talented actor, and should really start steering clear of movies with the word \"Focker\" in them...he is way too talented for that nonsense.  He entirely becomes a psychotic rapist, complete with tattoos, unruly hair, and a creepy southern accent.  The rest of the cast is great as well, although I'm going to opt not to comment further.  \"Cape Fear\" also benefitted from an incredible score that added so much suspense and intensity to each scene.  The score was a rearrangement of the original score for the 1962 film by Bernard Herrmann.  I love that man.  He did the brilliant scores to \"Psycho\" (and other Alfred Hitchcock films), \"Taxi Driver\", \"Citizen Kane\", and many, more.  Without his ear for music and how it compliments a scene I doubt these films would be as lasting, and memorable as they certainly have become.  Finally, the film visually is great, with dim lighting, an exciting climax, among many other aspects, all adding to the enjoyment of this film.  Just be warned...a girl does get a piece of her cheek bitten off...just a word to the wise.\r\n\r\n3 1/2 stars out of 4\r\n\r\n-Joseph Sbrilli",

Based on the original 1960's classic, the Cape Fear remake is a borderline decent thriller film with a few horror elements, but it's nothing beyond good. De Niro was good however, but then again, I'm just a little disappointed in this film. I'd expect something from Scorsese to be yet again a masterpiece, because let's face it, everything he does is masterful. But Cape Fear is definitely the weakest film of his career. I take come comfort knowing that it's a remake, and usually with remakes, anyone can mess them up. Only a few remakes in the history of film have been great, even some outdoing the original. But withn Cape Fear there just isn't that spark or fire in the film to really make astounding. The film is a decent time waster, but it's also disappointing when you take into consideration who made this remake. Oh well, even the greatest directors are bound to make a weak film sometime, and in the case of Scorsese, it's the Cape Fear remake. A decent cast with with decent, horrifying chills, don't really go beyond anything remarkable or memorable.",

Starring Oscar nominated performances and directed by the best in the business, Cape Fear increases the chilling atmosphere like the original, and is quite possibly better.\r\n\r\nHardened by 14 years in prison and out for revenge, psychopath, Max Cady looks to torment his former state lawyer and his family in many different and terrifying ways. Though the original already had a great and terrifying story, with an incredibly cast, this Cape Fear fine tunes the concept. Most notably, the Bowden family which Cady terrorizes is a lot less perfect than the original, with their own struggling problems. Sam Bowden is now Cady's attorney which even gives Cady a little justification for his actions. Robert De Niro gives one hell of a performance in this movie. Playing a southern psychopath who is cool and ultimately determined fits right up his ally. There is movie characterization of Max Cady in this movie, now not only a man out for revenge, but he's completely out of his mind! Spending years reading books, this Cady has a sick sence of philosophy which we see unfold. Cape Fear builds suspence and terror by being more personal, having good character developement, and or coarse some completely brutal and bloody scenes.\r\n\r\nMartin Scorsese style is put to great use as it fits wonderfully in the serial killer/thriller genre. But Scorsese, being all too familiar to the genre, uses his talent to give this movie a good, classic, neo-noir feel to it. The shots are fast paced and constantly moving. This movie uses a lot of closing in shots that shrinks the World as fear and suspence raises. There are also nice little looks with reflective objects that looks really cool, from mostly Cady's or other character's sunglasses. The cinematography looks wonderful, sometimes looking regular, sometimes looking totally stylish. The choice of having the sky turn red sometimes is questionable, but very cool and bizzar looking. This movie's pacing is also very thrilling and well put together, especially when the movie gets to its chilling climax. There are so many scenes and little details in this movie that have been referenced time over, even more times than the original. Scorsese really did push to make this movie creative and memorable, and gets even better when it uses a re-orchestrated version of Bernard Herrmann's original and scary music score.\r\n\r\nCape Fear is fun and creepy all over. Robert De Niro's performance is just as cool as Robert Mitchum's, and Nick Nolte plays his character very well in its new direction. And at a young age, Juliette Lewis earns an Oscar nomination for her role. Seeing cameos from the original cast adds a little fun to the movie as well. Cape Fear is overall not just a great thriller but a very well done remake and a classic, even when compared to the already classic and thrilling original.",

            "content": "I absolutely adored this movie. So much that after deep consideration, I have crowned it my new favourite movie of all time. This is also my first Martin Scorsese film and the first collaboration with DeNiro I have seen, and may I say, this was a damn good introduction. Cape Fear is an intelligent, tense thriller and remains one of the best (and most underrated) movies of all time in my opinion. It has everything that could make a movie good. Great acting, edge-of-your-seat moments, a great story, and one of the greatest endings I have ever seen in any movie. \r\n\r\nCape Fear begins with a man doing pushups with a close-up of his many tattoos. This man, who is named Max Cady,(Robert DeNiro) is paroled from prison and he goes on the hunt, tracking down his defender (Nick Nolte) who deliberately kept a document from him that may have eased his sentence or gotten him acquitted. It was pretty easy, seeing as Cady was illiterate. Well, now Cady can read, and he wants revenge. His lawyer, Sam Bowden, lives a relatively happy life with his wife (Jessica Lange) and his daughter (Juliette Lewis), and once Max Cady turns up, his life turns upside down. \r\n\r\nEven though Max Cady isn't very educated, it becomes clear that he is very smart, harassing Sam and his family strictly within the confines of the law. In the beginning, it doesn't appear that he wants to physically harm Sam, he only wants to drive him insane. As the movie progresses, the physical degree of the harassment escalates, all culminating in the final confrontation on the houseboat. There is also frequent mention of rape, and the beginning of that certain act shown. The movie, while not being outright scary, is extremely intense and menacing, and the movie is better for it. \r\n\r\nThe story itself is very good and it has loads of extremely tense moments, especially within the last 20-30 minutes and everything on the houseboat. The film is decently written, none of the dialogue really stands out, but it helps the story along, like it's supposed to. I absolutely loved how Scorsese made the film \"artsy\" with his clever use of camerawork and colour, and the general style of the film was terrific. The score was also fantastic and perfectly memorable. Needless to say, this was one of the most tense movies I have ever seen, and with one of the best endings. It's also very intelligent and stylish and that makes it all the more worthwhile to watch.\r\n\r\nThe film is bolstered by brilliant performances and its just too bad that a little movie called Silence of the Lambs came out in '91, because if it didn't, De Niro would have won Best Actor instead of Anthony Hopkins. Don't get me wrong, Hopkins deserved his Oscar I'm sure (I haven't seen Silence of the Lambs), but if it had come out in a different year, De Niro would have won. If my previous sentence hasn't explained this, Robert De Niro steals absolutely every scene he is in as Max Cady and proves that he is one of the most talented versatile actors in the business. Every scene he was in he gave me the creeps and if this movie has taught me one thing, it taught me not to trust Italian men with southern accents.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast were fantastic, Juliet Lewis getting an Oscar nomination for playing Danielle, Nick Nolte's daughter, and her performance was definitely worthy of a nomination. Jessica Lange was terrific as Nolte's wife, and everybody else in the cast was splendid as well, although I sadly cannot remember their names. I don't really have much else to say about the film, so I'm going to wrap this up. Watching this movie was a great joy, and I was involved the entire time. This has been officially crowned my favourite movie of all time and rightfully so, as this is a tremendously wonderful movie. One of the best and most underrated movies of all time, I would recommend Cape Fear to everyone and anyone.",

This is a great piece about loyalty, justice and the American legal system without getting to be too much of a courtroom drama. The performances are all fantastic, especially Robert De Niro and Juliette Lewis. The movie doesn't get too scary, but it's more about what the characters feel about the situations; it's smart, well-paced and it has a genuine sense of threat to it.",

The paroled man (De Niro) has found out that the lawyer hid some evidence that could have potentially kept him out of jail and he is determined to have his revenge.\n\nThe relatively simple plot is one of the plus points regarding Cape Fear, there are no elaborate twists or complex plot lines, there's just a simple story about a family being stalked by a man wanting revenge. It's a wonderfully acted film with De Niro on flying form as the crazed Max Cady with his performance echoing that of his iconic role in Taxi Driver. He is wonderfully menacing and provides the film with plenty of tension and suspense. It's also a very well written film that's full if interesting dialogue and uncomfortable moments between Cady and the young daughter of the lawyer played excellently by Juliette Lewis. The only real downside to the film is with its pacing, it can be very slow at times, particularly in the opening act and so takes a little while to get going. The final act is great though with an action packed conclusion that's great entertainment.\n\nCape Fear is a simple story that's well written and acted and provides both entertainment and uncomfortable moments.

It's not a bad film, but any means, it's actually quite good, but the atmosphere that a movie like this should definitely have, just didn't seem to be there, not enough, at least. It started to creep in near the end, on the boat, but then it ended shortly after and couldn't capitalize on it. I felt there should have been more time spent on the boat, actually, I expected there to be more and I thought the majority of the film took place there, but it's only the last 15-20 minutes or so. Maybe more of the original film takes place there, I don't know, but I'm definitely going to have to watch it and find out and see if they better handled some of the things I had problems with in this one. All in all though, it's a good thriller and De Niro's performance is awesome and definitely worth watching for that alone, but it just doesn't seem to grab you and keep you on the edge of your seat like it should.

This is not some simple horror thriller where the main baddie slowly stalks his victims with a big knife in hand as they run and fumble to get away from him. Here the antagonist carefully sets up things so you know he is doing it but he can't really be pinned for it therefore making him a more horrifying figure to me, because in some he is made somewhat more real. That being said I did find it somewhat hard to believe that De Niro's character would be all that much capable of architecting such situations where he can get away with some of the stuff he does. It's not a problem with the performance De Niro delivers, which is very good, but the type of character the film maker (Martin Scorsese was the director of this) got him to play. De Niro's character is southern accented character who comes across more as a common criminal than someone who would be capable of orchestrating the careful attacks he makes against this family. I guess they wanted to make sure it was really clear he was the bad guy than leave some level of doubt, I can't but wonder though how the film would have played it the character was more someone who did seem as though he could do the things he does and maybe there some level of doubt as to if he really was the one terrorizing this family. Still a good movie as is.",

Sorsese's camera work is some of my favorite in this film.  Super underrated as far as I am concern.  The camera almost moves in a playful way which makes the material so much creepier.  Juliette Lewis tears it up, but my favorite female in this one is Illeana Douglas.  Douglas is pretty much amazing in any role but here she is just damn perfect.

Instead of sitting on his epic crime tale, he turned around and made another film in a completely different genre, the noir-thriller Cape Fear (although this was a remake of the 1962 film, I have not seen the original, so I'll be reviewing it impartially). While Cape Fear may not stand with Scorsese's best work, it is a hell of a thriller to watch, with some real evil lurking at its heart. The characters of Cape Fear are not good people, not even the protagonists, as every character has at least one flaw. Sam Bowden (played by Nick Nolte) is the main character, and he is not exactly a good man. He cheats on his wife (Jessica Lange), neglects his troubled teen daughter (Juliette Lewis), and is self-righteous, leading to his predicament with the psychopathic Max Cady (played by Scorsese regular Robert De Niro).  De Niro plays a stage-five creep as Max Cady, who is not simply a bad man, but a truly evil one, as he torments Bowden and his troubled family. This film may not be one of Scorsese's finest, but it is a gripping tale and wonderful example of modern film noir.",

A terrifying, ultra-kinetic, flashy, ambient, darkly atmospheric and uniquely horrifying revenge film.  Cape Fear is sharp as a tac, undeniably visceral, explosively stylish, truly frightening and wickedly sickening.  This could be one of the best remakes of all time.  Cape Fear was Scorsese's follow-up to his epic gangster film Goodfellas, and he scored another early 90's critical and financial success.  It's a nerve shredding, scary as hell and deeply absorbing psychological powerhouse of pure captivation.  Packed to the brim with Scorsese trademarks such as his keen eye for detail, deep suspense and tension, brilliant acting and unique visual tones all of which add to the experience.   A full-throttle and instant pulse-pounder that sucks you in surrounded by a cloud of nonstop engagement from the beginning to the epic finale.  A pure blast of downright disturbing psychological adrenaline and action-packed dysphoria that's masterfully crafted by a legend of cinema.  \n        Robert Deniro is downright chilling.  His most disturbing performance since his talents culminated in Scorsese's own early 70's masterpiece \"Taxi-Driver\".  A brilliant act from a legend.  Nick Nolte is fantastic as well, the most convincing performance of his iconic career.  Juliette Lewis gives another searingly compelling performance in her young career at the time.

            "content": "Prison can do things to a person.  It can change them.  It can turn them into a completely different person.  For some, prison is hell.  In Martin Scorsese's 'Cape Fear' (a remake of the 1962 film), Max Cady is a man who has just been released from jail and makes it his goal to ruin the life of the lawyer who failed to keep him out.  Now, you'd think a character like this would only do such a thing had he been innocent to begin with, but Cady was busted for raping a young girl.  He was really nuts, and Robert DeNiro blows up on the screen in his portrayal of the fascinating psychopath.  We eventually learn the real point to this movie, when some feel there isn't one.  The battle between the lawyer and the psycho is really a battle between moral human law and religious law, made apparent by Cady's persistent reluctance to use the Bible to justify his actions.\r\n\r\nThe film follows Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), the lawyer who failed to keep Cady out of jail.  When he realizes that his former client is following him, a series of events occurs that pits the lawyer into standing up for what is right.  His goal to stop Cady faces many obstacles when he fails to find a way around stopping him without getting put in jail himself.  The pyschopath starts to bug his family, and eventually tricks Bowden's daughter (played amazingly by Juliette Lewis) into... err... making out with him.  While Cady succeeds into making Bowden's life a living hell, we can finally see the message of the story in it's full colors.  Cady's dependence on religious law to justify his psychotic actions shows how evil can always find it's way around the law, to the point that it can corrupt any human being.\r\n\r\nI think Scorsese did not get as much attention for this film as he should have, which is disappointing.  The biggest factor of this was the time it was released.  After the 80's, scary movies had become all about the scares, there were no meaning to them.  Sequels were also dying out to the point that no one cared, and remakes fit into that category.  Had this movie been released today, or back in the 70's or early 80's, it would've been more appreciated, and since it wasn't it is now one of the most unappreciated movies of all time.  If you haven't seen it, see it.  If you have, hopefully I talked you into gaining a little more respect for it.  Now that you know what 'Cape Fear' is really about, hopefully you can understand why I think this movie showcases one of the greatest battles of all-time.\r\n\r\nBONUS:  This movie stars Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, who starred as Bowden and Cady (respectively) in the 1962 version, directed by J. Lee Thompson.",

You can feel every moment of anxiety as the confident and successful lawyer, Sam Bowden, realizes Cady canât be bought or bullied and will stop at nothing until Bowden learns his lesson.  In addition to De Niro, Lewis is also brilliant as Bowdenâs naÃ¯ve teenage daughter, Dani, who falls for Cadyâs Southern charm.  Knowing what Cady is capable of, you fear for Dani with every subtle indication of her infatuation.

            "content": "I look at film remakes the same way I look at cover songs: they're pointless and unnecessary. Chances are you'll never top the original and there isn't much to improve on or change. Once something has been done, it's pointless to make the same exact thing again, unless you're looking to make money. \r\n\r\nOf course, most remakes don't have Martin Scorsese directing Robert De Niro and Nick Nolte (man, I've been watching way too many Nick Nolte movies lately). The fact that this one has all that talent and still ended up sucking is that much more disappointing. But what do you expect, this is a remake. \r\n\r\nI think Scorsese over-directed this one. He really overdoes the musical score. The score is booming in every scene and Scorsese tries to make scenes seem scary with the music. When the same musical score is playing over every scene, it kind of loses its effect (kind of like how Scorsese overdoes the musical score in the trailer for Shutter Island. Instead of making the trailer seem scary with the music, he overdoes it and the intended effect is lost.). \r\n\r\nAlso, you know the camera motion that Scorsese loves: the one where the camera is low, then zooms in while looking up at a character during a crucial moment (you'd know it if you saw it.)? Well Scorsese overdoes that here too. \r\n\r\nScorsese probably knew the material he was working with here was weak, so he tried to make the film look and sound better than what it really was. \r\nThe story itself is pretty standard and predictable: a psychopath gets out of jail and stalks a family. Does the psychopath stalking a family storyline sound similiar to another movie? You're probably saying, \"Yes it does. It sounds like What About Bob?\" Can you tell me what year the terrible movie What About Bob? came out. You're probably saying, \"I sure can. What About Bob? came out in 1991.\" Correctamundo. Now can you tell me what year the piece of garbage film Cape Fear came out? You reply, \"It came out in 1991.\" That's absolutely correct. 1991. \r\n\r\nCape Fear and What About Bob?, two terrible movies that essentially tell the same story (in different manners of course) came out in the same year. Is that a coincidence? I think not. Maybe Martin Scorsese and What About Bob? director Frank Oz (yes, the same Frank Oz who voiced and did the puppet work for Yoda in the original Star Wars films) got together back in 1991 and said, \"Hey let's make two annoying movies that are basically the same and release them in the same year. We'll piss off audiences with how terrible the movies are, but we'll be swimming in cash. This will be the greatest inside joke ever. Andy Kauffman would have never thought of this!\" \r\n\r\nWell guess what, if that's true, they must have been happy afterward. Cape Fear was awarded with two Academy Award nominations (Best leading actor for De Niro, which was a decent performance, but not nomination worthy, and best supporting actress for Juliette Lewis (who is one of my favorite actresses), which is a performance I will discuss a little bit later.). \r\n\r\nCape Fear is also Scorsese's second highest grossing movie, so it appears that from a commercial standpoint his little scam was a success. Getting back on a serious note, why would Scorsese direct this movie? At this point in his career, he had already directed classics like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, After Hours, The King of Comedy, and he was freshly off of making Goodfellas. Cape Fear is a commercial movie designed to make money. \r\n\r\nIt offers nothing new or thought provoking or even enjoyable. Let's get to the acting. In this movie Bob De Niro reminded me of Harvey Keitel. He had similar hair to Keitel (I would like to say a few things about De Niro's hair in this movie. It was very annoying. It was wild, almost like Dr. Will's hair from Big Brother. Also, De Niro even had a pony tail in a few scenes. It was really embarrassing to watch. I just wanted to chop his hair off.) and De Niro even pulled off a very good Southern accent. \r\n\r\nAt first he's somewhat hard to understand, but you'll get used to his voice. Even though I didn't like this movie, De Niro delievered a physically good performance. He really transforms into this guy. \r\n\r\nNick Nolte was actually good in this movie. However, get used to Nolte doing one of his favorite acting tools: going from really loud to extremely quiet in the same scene. Keep your remote handy so you can pump up the volume when Nolte talks. \r\n\r\nJuliette Lewis was pretty good in this movie. There is actually one scene in this movie featuring Lewis and De Niro that is probably the best and worst scene in this movie. The acting in this particular scene is brilliant. It's simply twelve or so minutes of Lewis and De Niro exchanging dialogue. It's acting paradise. \r\n\r\nThe problem with this scene is that Lewis and De Niro are flirting with each other throughout the scene when Lewis knows that he is a murderous psycho that has been stalking her family. It's just unbelievable watching this scene. She makes out with him and it seems like she falls in love with him. She even defends him to her family. And remember, at this point in the movie she knows he's a murderer, a rapist, and a stalker. That's just one of the unbelievable things in this movie. \r\n\r\nHere are a few other conveniently unbelievable things in this movie: De Niro's character must have had a GPS in his brain because he's very good at randomly finding people with little information and he's a very dumb villain because he has dozens of opportunities to kill and rape the family (if those were his intentions, he really doesn't say what his exact plans for revenge were), but he never takes advantage of the situations. \r\n\r\nThere is also an image that I'm not going to ruin here that takes place within the last twenty minutes of the movie that is so ridiculous and unintentionally hilarious that it would be a sin for me to ruin it for you. \r\n\r\nDe Niro's character was just unbelievable to me. His character was angry because he felt that Nolte's character (a lawyer) did a lousy job of defending him on trial. So what is De Niro's first plan upon leaving prison? Getting back in prison by murdering Nolte and his family. How dumb does this movie think the audience is? This movie is watchable, but it's dumb and predictable and it's a complete waste of great talent.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese's stylish and visual stunning remake of the 1962 classic thriller of the same name which starred Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum. The story concerns the sadistic psychopathic rapist Max Cady, played with a brilliant intensity by Robert De Niro in a chilling Oscar and Golden Globe nominated performance he has returned after serving 14 years in prison for the  brutal sexual assault of a young girl to exact his revenge against a former public defender Sam Bowden, played solidly by Nick Notle in one of his finest performances whom he blames for his conviction due to a purposefully faulty defense during his trail, Cady begins a deadly game of cat and mouse with Sam and his wife Leigh and their daughter Danielle, wonderfully played by Jessica Lange and young Juliette Lewis who is a revelation in a exquisite Oscar nominated performance. Sam is legally powerless to keep Cady from tormenting him and his family, a terrible set of circumstances will lead to a heart-stopping climax abroad a houseboat on \"Cape Fear,\" that is one of the most suspenseful and hair-rising confrontations ever filmed. Energetically directed by Martin Scorsese with remarkable cinematography by Freddie Francis, and razor-sharp editing by Thelma Schoomaker, the late Bernard Hermann's haunting original score is newly recorded by Elmer Bernstein to great effect, special kudos must go to Elaine & Saul Bass for the brilliantly surreal opening title sequence, exceptional supporting performances by Joe Don Baker, Illleana Douglas, Fred Dalton Thompsom and Zully Montero, terrific cameos by Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam who all starred in the original film, but this motion picture belongs to De Niro hands down his Max Cady is an unstoppable force of pure retribution, a monster of almost inhuman strength and resilience, it is  truly a frightening and unforgettable performance. Riveting, this film will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last frame!   Highly Recommended.",

It has some intense scenes, that are sometimes truly disturbing and sometimes it's just over-the-top and it looks like Scorsese's borrowing slasher movie iconography. \r\n\r\nThe movie's dilemma of whether it's a serious drama or B-fiction, is compensated by the all-star cast. Robert DeNiro is incredible as Max Cady, he's crazy as hell in this movie, way more crazy than the already creepy Travis Bickle. If you're a fan of his, you need to check this movie out. While I don't it's one his best performance, it's really fun to look at him. Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange do a good at portraying a couple that suffers from stress and unloyalty, but the other performance that stood out for me was Juliette Lewis as Danielle Bowden. This is Lewis' best performance, she does a fantastic job at playing a teenager who's attracted by DeNiro's Max Cady.\r\n\r\nAnyway, watch Cape Fear if you're a Scorsese fan, but don't expect a masterpiece.",

Director, Martian Scorcesse departs nicely from his popular crime films to this drilling and brooding thriller. It's a brutal, demonic film with a grip like a vise; it grabs you early, its fingers around your throat, and never lets go. A tough, violent tense thriller with a great performance by Robert De Niro. Robert De Niro is the actor in Hollywood with the most potential to disturb. With his slick greasy hair, rapturous tattoos, and polite southern accent, he creates a Max Cady that makes Robert Mitchum seem like a boyscout. The movie was enthralling in the most disturbing way. I wanted so badly to look away from the carnage, but was completely unable.

In the Scorsese version, Bowden is flawed and guilty, and indeed everyone in this film is weak in one way or another, and there are no heroes. That's the Scorsese touch. \r\n\r\nNolte's character is more complex. He is not a bad man, but not a very good one, and he finally agrees with his private eye (Joe Don Baker) that maybe three guys should be hired to pound some sense into Max Cady. When Cady thrashes the three goons and comes looking for the Nolte character, we realize the complexity of this movie. Unlike the simplistic version of this scene we have seen in a hundred thrillers, what Scorsese gives us is a villain who has been wronged, seeking to harm a hero who has sinned.\r\n\r\nCady is played by Robert De Niro, in a role filled by Robert Mitchum in 1962. Covered with tattoos spelling out dire biblical warnings, Cady is an iron-pumping redneck who learned to read in prison (\"I started with Dick, Jane and Spot and went on to lawbooks\"). He drives into town in a Mustang convertible and offers to teach Bowden something about the law.\r\n\r\nAnd soon, everywhere Bowden looks, he sees the ominous, threatening presence of Max Cady: outside a restaurant, in a movie theater, on the wall bordering his property.\r\n\r\nBut Cady is clever and stays just this side of the law; he doesn't actually trespass, and he doesn't do physical harm to Bowden.\r\n\r\nIt's almost a game with Cady to taunt Bowden to the breaking point.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe this is why I admire this film so much because \"Cape Fear\" is very complex and also dark. It is also very threatning and scary when someone keeps stalking on the pray.  Scorsese loves to put in guilt and redemption clues just as he did in his previous films, \"Taxi Driver\", \"Goodfellas\". Scorsese really gets deep within this film and successfully manages to twist and have some fun with the plot.",

While Cape Fear is not one of Scorsese's best it is definitely one of the highest in terms of entertainment value. Led by the towering performance of Robert Deniro, Cape Fear is a deliciously campy, sinister and disturbing thrill ride. What i really enjoyed most about this movie was the great cast. Deniro steals the show as he balances downright psychosis and incredible smarts making for a villain you almost root for. Nick Nolte also does some great work here as the lawyer that Deniro is just trying to screw with. Jessica Lange is a bit underused, but still very good as the mother who is torn apart by the situation at hand. Also, Juliette Lewis gives an astonishing performance. There is a notable scene in this movie where Lewis and Deniro meet alone and it is one of the most disturbing and fascinating scenes of the movie, and it was all ad libbed. This is a movie that should be recognized for Scorsese's range and his ability to really amp up the fear. Cape Fear is one of Scorsese's most entertaining pieces because it goes so far over the edge, you will forget where you jumped from.\r\n\r\nMORE REVIEW COMING SOON",

The acting is great, Scorsese and Nolte really drawing you into the horror of the scenario, with Mitchum and Peck making neat cameos in nod to the original.  Also Joe Don Baker was rather capable in his role even if the character was not.
