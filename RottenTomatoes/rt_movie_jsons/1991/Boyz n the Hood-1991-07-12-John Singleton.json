Although his hard-nosed father instills proper values and respect in him, and his devout girlfriend Brandi (Nia Long) teaches him about faith, Tre's friends Doughboy (Ice Cube) and Ricky (Morris Chestnut) don't have the same kind of support and are drawn into the neighborhood's booming drug and gang culture, with increasingly tragic results.",

            "content": "Written from first-hand experience, Boyz N The Hood was an incredible calling card for John Singleton, and it remains his most influential and widely recognised film. It's a fascinating window into South Central LA in the mid-80 and early 90s, when the infamous riots would take place, as well as a searing indictment of gang culture. There's not many big events in the film, with most of the time being spent watching characters chat about things, posture and make wise cracks, but that's actually why the film is so enjoyable. It builds a bond between the characters and the audience, draws you into their lives, and as such you feel something when tragedy occurs. The standout performers are, of course, Cuba Gooding Jnr and Ice Cube, who play very different individuals, with separate goals and aspirations, but has them reuniting when the situation calls for it. Most of the dialogue is profanity filled tirades or insult laden banter, but it also contains a lot of insight into the woes of its characters, ones which many people still face to this day. It's not a black and white story of one side versus the other, but about how a life of gang violence will always lead to disastrous consequences. It's one hell of a debut, and its such a shame that Singleton would never reach such lofty heights in his career again. But if he's remembered for nothing other than this film, that's still a legacy to be proud of.",

The message is that America doesn't seem interested in the violence and poverty in our own country. Ice Cube says he turns on the TV and sees all the reports about violence and conflict all over the world. But nothing about his friend getting killed. And the film touches on gentrification and culturally biased standardized testing and several other important issues of systemic racism. In delivering this message, I think the film does a great job. But just as a piece of art or entertainment, I don't think it does anything special. And maybe that's because it was very original when it was made, and since then many other movies have expanded on it and done some of these themes better. I think the message is still very relevant in 2021. But the film isn't amazing in any area. Every American should still see it at least once though.",

Sadly, it felt like the rest of the movie was a fairly by-the-numbers story about young people growing up in a dangerous community with a lot of bad influences. Coming-of-age is already a genre that I don‚Äôt typically enjoy, and adding in the depressing nature of this particular film, I had a tough time with it. Admittedly, I was emotionally invested in the journey of the characters, and I shed a few tears at one point when tragedy struck. Yet I saw it coming. Every beat of this movie felt like something I‚Äôve seen before in other films, so it was extremely predictable. Many of those movies might have been drawing inspiration from this one, but I just happen to be in a place now where this all seemed rote. I guess at this point I‚Äôm looking for a more unique or nuanced approach to these topics, or even films that shine a light on how we can move forward rather than the pessimistic note we are left with here. I can‚Äôt deny that Boyz ‚ÄòN the Hood is a well-made movie, and I imagine if I saw it back in the early 90s when I was a teen it would have struck a chord with me and shifted my worldview in some way.

Boyz N the Hood definitely fits into the latter category, and while most of us are aware that these unfortunate cases of cyclical violence exist, I always think portraying the circumstances and motivations through stories creates way more empathy than a two minute news clip featuring faceless victims. Singleton does an admirable job here, even with aspects such as sound design, where the constant whir of helicopters and outbursts of gunfire creates a level of tension for me, despite the characters seeming totally unaware, as these sounds have become a standard and unalterable feature of their environment.",

If you are the type of person to be on your phone while watching a movie, you wont watching this because the movie instantly grabs your attention. A few major characters in the movies is, Ice Cube, Morris Chestnut. The movie came out in 1991. It's a very popular movie, just about everybody I ever met watched it multiple times. Its one of those movies you could watch over and over and never get tired of it. The movie was shot in Los Angeles The setting instantly tells you what type of movie it is. Any movie that's informing can be on the urge of being good & 'Boyz N The Hood' is very informing how things were for a certain type of individuals.\n\n\tCuba Gooding Jr. who play's Tre  moved out his mom's house to live with his father due to the violence going on the neighborhood. He also got into a fight in school which really made his mom come to the conclusion that he had to leave as soon as possible. He moves with his dad and the violence still continues. He ending linking up with old friends he knew from when he use to visit his dad. One thing tre had that they didn't have is a father that was around. Violence goes on throughout the movie. \n\n\tWhen I first seen Boyz N the hood i was very fascinated. It really opened my eyes and made me realize how crazy life can be. My brother and I watched it when we were ten and eleven. My first impression was, \"I have to see this again.\" The movie is very realistic which is my strongest impression, and it's also very relatable because i grew up in a very dangerous community, I moved neighborhood to neighborhood due to violence and it never stopped until I moved to a different city.\n\nThe characters played their roles perfectly and I feel as the ones they picked to play each role were a perfect fit. The movie starts off with violence; usually when a movie starts with violence it ends with violence. Tre's mom didn't think that his father's neighborhood was as bad as the one he lived in before. She wouldn't of moved him there if she knew. He moves in with his Dad and experiences a lot of drama. The simple fact that they show you the main characters when they are young and when they are grown, allows you to develop feelings for them. I wanted the best for each character.\nThe acting was on the point; you would've thought it was based on a true story because of how good the acting was,  i was very convinced. Ice Cube known came from a rough environment so I feel as for him to play Doe Boy which was the ghetto role was very easy.\n\n\tIf you want to be informed on how lives were for some African Americans, I suggest you watch this movie. It's not based on a true story, but the things that happens in the movie are very realistic. There are shooting scenes, fighting scenes. Lots of drama goes on in movie it's very impressive and informative. Its one of those movies that will snatch your attention immediately",

This is not demoralized hip hop flick, nor a detached and dehumanized story about ghetto violence, it's a story about maintaining your human qualities growing up without a mother and father in a death zone, where people do not value the lives of others and their own lives slightly more. This is an exemplary directional debut from John Singleton, who managed to create an all time classic.",

All people from the suburbs know of South Central LA is what NWA and Snoop Dogg have told you about it in their albums.  Sounds kind of grimy and rugged, but in a cool and tough guy sort of way, right?  John Singleton takes that thought that is bobbing in your head and puts a bullet right through it.  This is a devastating look at what most young men in the Los Angeles ghetto have to deal with on a daily basis.  Just walking from a picnic down the street to your house, not even a block away you have to worry about someone driving by and opening up fire on you.  Not just a couple random shots from a handgun, but from an automatic military rifle, because of course you did something for them to cause this behavior, right? Wrong again, they are shooting at you and trying to end your life because you may be wearing the wrong colors or maybe they just don't like your neighborhood for some unknown reason.  What Singleton does with this movie is great, because up until Boyz in the Hood gang violence was glorified in music.  There is no glorification in this movie at all.  If you come away from watching this movie thinking it is cool to be \"hood\" or live in the \"ghetto\" you have to immediately have your head examined, because you have lost your mind.  A harrowing look at not only how violence and gangs have an effect on the people involved in this criminal activity, but also how it effects the people around them, their family and friends.  We get a unique look from all perspectives in this movie.  From the mother and father to the gangbanger and the do good star football player athlete and they are all stuck in the hell they are forced to call home.  There is a very poignant scene at the end of this movie where Dough Boy played by Ice Cube just kind of shakes his head and realizes people get killed every single day in their area and no one will ever hear about it or even know about it.  He is not mad at this realization, he has accepted this fact and has come to terms with it.  Which is sad in its own right.",

They must learn the whys of where they live before they can focus on the hows of improving their own lives, but as every day goes by a little bit of them is killed off as opportunities and hopes and dreams pass them by.

If you aren't persuaded by its coming-of-age angle, then you might be persuaded by the magnificent performances from the film's characters. I'll admit that it is sometimes hard for me to immerse myself into the film's particular setting, but I find that this film is very realistic. I trait I tend to notice about this film is that it's very careful about glamorizing gang violence, and this approach allows for an unadulterated portrait of the film's characters, which are all well-played, and coupled with a solid script, this makes for a highly meritorious work of drama. The film also carries a certain atmosphere, bolstered by its well-polished production values, which give it a kind of timeless quality, which is especially important considering that the issues dealt with in the film are still around today. This is certainly a very thought-provoking film, and a highly immersive one, and for that reason, it is still quite relevant today. Relevant or no, it was a great film, and one of the best the 1990's has to offer.",

You really feel for all of them at one point or another, and though the script does feature some misses (such as a crazy black cop whose more of a caricature of a corrupt police officer than a real person) most of it is dead on and you get the sense that director John Singleton was writing about something he lived personally, not just heard about.  Cuba Gooding Jr., Lawrence Fishburne, and Ice Cube are all at the top of their game and their performances combined with a great script make this one a definite must watch.",

It was John Singleton's first film that he wrote and directed and is probably still considered by most as his best especially considering that he isn't exactly prolific. You could even argue that Singleton's work has gotten worse over the years with almost each movie going down in quality with each one.\n\nThis movie works on a lot of levels. The acting is really good. This was Ice Cube's first movie and although he is basically playing a version of himself there is no denying that he has talent as an actor. Cuba Gooding Jr, Laurence Fishburne, and Morris Chestnut also do a great job.\n\nI like this movie although there are some weird things in the plot that don't exactly work for me. In all it is a good movie but in some ways it doesn't seem complete for some reason. I really like the characters and the movie's plot is solid although with these characters I think the whole concept would actually work better as a TV show especially with the high standard of where TV is at now. Overall the movie is slightly above average but not quite on the same level as other similar movies such as Colors (1988).",

My only problem with it was the horrid soundtrack, it could've been much better especially if they threw more Ice Cube & N.W.A. tracks in there. Great hard knock life drama from the early 90's.",

I didn't grow up anywhere near this kind of thing really, but it is a very interesting and informative watch.  I would feel confident in saying that everyone should watch this movie.  Whitey can feel bad for themselves, people that don't live around this kind of thing can get an interesting glimpse into a world they typically prefer to believe doesn't exist, and the people who do live in this world can get some positive messages from a man named Furious that might help them get out of that world.  Stopping that kind of violence is a worthy cause, even if the white man must be blamed for most of it.\nFull Review at: http://robertreviewsstuff.wordpress.com/2013/12/09/boyz-n-the-hood-1991/",

They must learn the whys of where they live before they can focus on the hows of improving their own lives, but as every day goes by a little bit of them is killed off as opportunities and hopes and dreams pass them by.

            "content": "Ice Cube failed in Anaconda but I gave him another shot in Boyz 'N he Hood. The gang life is not easy and making a movie about it can be even harder, probably not but I wouldn't know. With the title and summary of the movie I knew this could be one of two movies, one, a violent bloodbath of gang violence with obvious characters and little story, or the exact opposite. Boyz 'N the Hood has really good characters, a deep and meaningful story, and a well developed look in the gang life of California. I don't know how accurate this movie is to the gang life in the 1990s but I felt sympathy for all the characters living in that life and it is hard to believe people actually live like that in real life.\n\tThe story follows the life of Tre, a really intelligent, black, man struggling with the life he lives in. Lawrence Fishburne plays Tre's father and he is an incredible character. I will start this review praising his awesomeness and knowledge of the real world. He is a man who understands the life he lives in and he does not want that for his son. From a very young age he teaches his son how to be a man and how to avoid the life. He is a great role model for his son and brings a lot of depth to the movie. \nThere is a scene when he prevents gang violence and goes on a rant about why the hood is the hood. He says something along the lines on the government wants blacks to kill each other. On every corner of the ghetto there is a liquor store and a gun store. That is the true meaning of the movie, or the deeper meaning. Gang violence destroys people's lives and it is pointless. The movie exaggerates how the gangs know it is pointless but they do it because they have to. Ice Cube's character hits on this point too, being the gangster of the movie and the head of his own crew. Its characters like Tre and Ricky which give people hope.\nFishburne and Ice Cube did fantastic in the roles they were given. They went above and beyond and put more than 100% in their performance but Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Tre as an adult and he was underwhelming. I'm not the biggest fan of Cuba Gooding Jr. I don't think he is a great actor but I think he was a good choice for the role. Tre seemed almost unimportant and I don't think it was because of how the story was written, I believe it was because of how he was acted. Tre is different. He doesn't want to live the thug life. He wants to be a success and movie out of the hood. Gooding Jr. didn't act that out so well. His character was boring at times and it took all the way to the end to get any emotion out of him. I liked his character as a kid way better than an adult. That's a huge complement on the child actor, or a slap in the face to Cube Gooding Jr. you decide.\nTowards the middle of the movie Ricky has a chance to go to college. Ricky is a great character as well. He isn't so smart but he is good at football. He was another example of people wanting to get out of the hood and his only chance was football. This is the case for a lot of young people trapped in the gang life. Unfortunately, his story was more than predictable and half way through the movie I knew exactly how it was going to end. I wasn't surprised by the ending at all but it didn't take away from the movie as much as I thought it would. The very last scene with Tre and Ice Cube was so emotional and deep it saved the movie for me. It made me able to look past the predictability and enjoy the movie. \nThroughout this review I mention the thug life or the gangster life and I did not expect so much detail of the life in the movie. At one point there is a little girl in a diaper and Tre picks her up before a car hits her. Tre returns her to her mother and all the mother cares about is getting a fix. She didn't care about her child and wanted cocaine instead. \"You selling rocks.\" She says. I know it's a movie but I believed that happens in real life and it made me sick. I like how Tre had a great relationship with his father. I expected him and his father to clash heads and argue, but they didn't. In more ways than one this movie surprised I liked it way more than I thought I would. \nOverall, Boyz 'N the Hood was very emotional, very impactful, very practicable, but very good and I can see myself watching it again and again. I can look past the obvious endgame and enjoy the cinematic experience. Ice Cube gave me a surprising performance while Cuba Gooding Jr. disappointed me. Lawrence Fishburne gave the best performance I have ever seen him in and I expected nothing less. With a title like Boyz 'N the Hood I expected the violent bloodbath. I did not expect the emotional rollercoaster and lovable and relatable characters. This movie surprised me a lot and I'm proud to give it the WillyT Honorable Mention.",

            "content": "I could very easily make a song reference here, but I won't, because rap isn't technically music, and plus, if I couldn't already go the rest of my life without hearing another rap song, I'm pretty much spent after this film. Granted, this film's soundtrack isn't too played up, and when it is, it features '90s rap, which is not quite as bad as modern rap, but is still pretty weak, and that is where they get you, because if I am to ever to watch this film again, then that would mean that I would have to sit through its soundtrack again, and I would not mind watching this film... up to a point, of course. Yup, I tell you what, nothing says quality, Oscar-nominated Cannes Film Festival entry quite like \"Boyz n the Hood\", featuring Ice Cube and Cuba Gooding, Jr., and directed by John Singletone before \"2 Fast 2 Furious\" and 2011's \"Abduction\", but make no mistake, if you can get by its title and soundtrack, this film good one. Hey, I joke, but this film's title features a \"the\", rather than a \"da\", so clearly we're looking at a truly brilliant filmmaking team, as reflected by its member's going on to make perfectly good decisions in the entertainment business. Hey, Laurence Fishburne's character in this film is named Furious, so maybe John Singleton did \"2 Fast 2 Furious\" because he thought he was being asked to do a sequel to this film, or at least that's my attempt at finding an excuse for Singleton's \"2 Fast 2 Furious\", because, you know, it makes Singleton's decision making sound much more sensible. Eh, whatever, I'm just going to go ahead and accept that it was only a matter of time, as Singleton has never been the most subtle of storytellers, as this film will actually tell you. Don't get me wrong, this film is good and all, because as much as I hate to admit it, the hip-hop points in its soundtrack is hardly the biggest of its problems.\r\n\r\nI won't go so far as to deem this film's story concept minimalist, because this is a pretty juicy coming-of-age drama that needs time to develop, and takes that time, yet I'm not entirely sure a runtime that stops just short of two hours is entirely necessary, as reflected by the moments in which the film slips into excess material, if not filler, that does little more than run out the clock and slow down momentum, often into repetition. The film is by no means too repetitious, but it does have a tendency to fall into aimless spells that sometimes stick around so long that you kind of get used to them, thus making the eventual shifts in actual plotting focus slightly jarring, and therefore detrimental to resonance that is hurt enough by a bit of undeniable cheesiness. Sure, the film's dramatic hiccups are hardly the cheesiest moments in the film, because even when you disregard the lame '90s neo-soul/R&B and hip hop soundtrack, musical aspects are considerably hurt by a weakly corny score by Stanley Clarke that still carried the stink of pop film score sensibilities of the '80s, and yet, when cheesiness does catch up with the dramatic aspects, they're sometimes in the form of, of all things histrionics. I say, \"of all things\", because this film is generally quite genuine and realist in its handling of its worthy subject matter, yet there are still those occasions in which the film's dramatic kick feels kind of questionable, or at least comes off as questionable, because if nothing else is mishandled in this film, it is, of course, it's subtlety. There is enough inspiration behind the overdone dramatic touches to compensate for the resonance lost in the fierce wake of subtlety lapses, but there is no fully ignoring the blatant overemphasis on the intense themes and drama that drive this film, which would be more effective if it wasn't so desperate to be effective, telegraphing its depths in a passionately overambitious way that takes you out of the resonance a bit, no matter how striking it may be on the whole. The aforementioned flaws outside of subtlety issues range from barely considerable to fairly light, but subtlety issues can be enough to hold a drama back, and sure enough, no matter how much this film presses on as rewarding, its full potential is ironically all but lost because of John Singleton's being unable to be as controlled as he probably should be in the handling of a worthy tale. In spite of this, as overambitious as this film is, when it fulfills its ambition, at least to a certain degree, it compels, and let me tell you, this film fulfills hits such compelling moments more often than not, as well it should, considering the importance of its subject matter.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of darkly stereotypical black communities, or rather, \"hoods\", have been swiftly exacerbating for decades, with the early '90s timeframe in which this film takes place, alone, being all but beyond saving, and that's frustrating, especially when you look within the community and find what lucky few, relatively cleaner blacks there are being challenged, if not threatened, and even influenced by an inhumanly harsh environment that blemishes society as we know it, so the subject matter explored in this film is certainly relevant and important, with worthy that join drama potential within the story concept itself to craft a premise that deserves an inspired execution. As I said, the film is every bit as overambitious as it is inspired, and that cheeses up the interpretation of this worthy story concept, but make no mistake, for every aspect that is too ambitious for its own good, there is an aspect backed by genuinely effective inspiration, even in the writing department, as John Singleton puts together a script that isn't especially outstanding, but is rich enough to do this premise some justice, juggling so many themes - which include life in an unsafe environment, questionable influences, coming of age and bonds between loved ones - that it sometimes gets uneven in its thematic focus, but never to where the thematic depth and dramatic weight of this story aren't fleshed out enough to intrigue and compel. If Singleton accomplishes nothing else as screenwriter, he delivers on characterization that, in spite of subtlety issues and even the occasional histrionic beat, breathes enough life into the essence of this film's characters for them to feel relatable on a human level, and it helps that the portrayals of such well-rounded characters are also graced with human inspiration. As intense as plenty of this film's characters are in a lot of ways, there's only so much for this talented cast to work with, yet there's a certain charisma to everyone, and when more than just charisma is requested, the performers really deliver on dramatic heart whose gradual escalation helps in reinforcing a sense of escalation in the final product's intensity. The impassioned, if often rather underwritten performances throughout the final product help in driving the human weight to this layered and thematically rich study on important social themes, but at the end of the day, it's a certain offscreen performance that really brings Singleton's script to life, and that is, of course, Singleton himself. As director, Singleton doesn't so much unveil shortcomings to be fixed later, as much as he gives you tastes of shortcomings that he's always had, particularly when it comes to subtlety, because if Singleton were more restrained in his meditations upon this subject matter, we would perhaps be looking at a pretty powerful drama, yet as things stand, the commitment to Singleton's storytelling tends to compensate for many of the shortcomings in subtlety through striking imagery and soul that make the heavier moments tense and the more resonant moments all but, if not decidedly piercing. At the very least, Singleton entertains you enough to keep his flaws as a storyteller from throwing you off too much, and when such entertainment value is broken up by dramatic effectiveness, compellingness finds itself firmly secured enough for the final product to take all of its blows and still come out as effective.\r\n\r\nOverall, filler often drives storytelling into aimless spells, while the occasional histrionic dramatic beat marks a particularly height in subtlety issues that taint the final product throughout its course and could have crafted an overambitiously underwhelming effort, yet goes fought back enough by the thematically heavy writing, inspired acting and generally entertaining, when not dramatically effective directorial storytelling to do a worthy story concept enough justice for \"Boyz n the Hood\" to stand as flawed, but ultimately compelling dramatic study on the deplorable then-modern and still-worsening conditions of inner city black communities.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

            "content": "Boyz n the Hood's depiction of the dog-eat-dog nature of inner city ghettos is pretty much spot on.  Not to mention, Ice Cube who was famous primarily for being in NWA, gives an impressively believable performance, showing that he can be a great musician and a fine actor as well.  Almost everyone performs good to great here though.\n\n\nOne sequence in particular that is truly hard hitting, is the death of Ricky.  The composition of this sequence is nothing short of impressive, with how the sound fades out, aside from the children playing in the background, reflecting the audiences realization of the sudden truth: Ricky has met his demise.  There's also the performances in this part, they're strong throughout the film, but here in particular it's as if they weren't acting; their conviction of shock, grief and sadness at Ricky's death comes across as nothing short of genuine and natural.  Oh yeah, the somber soundtrack adds another layer to this scene.  Not to mention the last thing Doughboy did with Ricky before this scene was beat him up.  All these combined should develop at least a lump in your throat.\n\nIt's easy to see why Boyz N the Hood is as influential as it is, and why it spawned a plethora of blaxploitation hood dramas in the 90's onward post its release.  John Singleton, like Quentin Tarantino with Reservoir Dogs, did an impressive job and showed much promising cinematic skill with this debut.",
