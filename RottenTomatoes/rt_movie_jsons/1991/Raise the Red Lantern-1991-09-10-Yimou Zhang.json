            "content": "Combining limited scale and sumptuous visuals, Raise the Red Lantern is one of the great cinematic adaptations of the 'gilded birdcage' premise. A psychological torture chamber that adopts the skin of a melodrama, Zhang produces a scathing critique of social norms and gender roles at a time when doing so was formally frowned upon by the Chinese state, resulting in temporary censorship. \n\nWomen are lured into a polygamous matrimony with the promise of fine silks and an easy lifestyle, only to be find themselves in a pit of vipers as they are forced to compete with one another for the affections of a husband who is focused purely on tradition and lust with a face left deliberately obscured for the entire length of the film. Though a bit heavy-handed in its narrative with 30 years of gender-focused film building on its foundations (Gong's Songlian is forced to leave an education behind to be married off into a traditional household), the film is powerful in its simplicity and visually beautiful. Notably, the screenplay doesn't leave characters exclusively as one-note as they could have, incorporating some degree of engaging subterfuge that goes beyond their superficial role; the deceitfully compassionate second mistress Zhuoyun is a particular favorite, her betrayal reminds me of Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden.\n\nAdmittedly a bit obvious in theme decades down the line, Raise the Red Lantern is still a classic of 'modern' Chinese film that delivers excellent performances, expert cinematography, and subversive themes for its time. (4/5)",

I really couldn't get into the main character and felt like she brought much of the tragedy to the house, the one I actually liked was the 3rd wife who was killed. From the very beginning 4th wife was angry, prideful, and acting childish. It seemed like she choose that life, so why did she not at least try to make the best of it? Idk then she kills her maid out of pride/revenge. She cuts off some of the ear of the 2nd wife out of spite. She gets the 3rd wife killed with her loose lips. She lies n says she is pregnant when she isn't-just not a very good person. Was her situation awful-yes but she also had tons of food, not have to entertain her husband every nite, doesn't have to work, gets to wear expensive clothes/have servants and could've striked up friendships with at least some of the other wives/servants. Could I handle sharing my husband, not if I don't have to, but I guess if I had to I'd prob not try to ruin the rest of my life over him esp if he is kinda jerk anyway. I guess the point of movie was to show how messed up that life can be rather than give u a character u can connect to, but it certainly didn't help me like the film any altho stylistically and dramatically it was very well done.",

I liked how they start by presenting the traditions that run this household and then show how the wives find ways to manipulate the traditions to get their way. The master of the house becomes a mere pawn that they move around whenever they desire. The director came close to never even showing the master, and I think that would have been awesome because he was such a non-character in the film. As for our protagonist, I kept hoping that Songlian would figure it all out. I was expecting her to be the clever one who discovered all the loopholes in the system, so that she could become the power player. Sadly, it doesn't seem like that is quite the story they wanted to tell. It left me frustrated with the story, and annoyed that the ending was so lackluster. I wanted more at the end, but it just quit without resolving much. The film is, like most of Zhang Yimou's work, beautiful. It has a number of gorgeous visual moments and he utilizes colorful items in order to accentuate the visuals. I don't think Raise the Red Lantern was quite my kind of film, but it was certainly worth watching.",

Exile, the home and power are central to the film that puts wives against husband, servants against wives and of course wives against wives. It's an intricate dance as the women all vie for the little sliver of power allowed to them. Gong Li is phenomenal, dominating the screen, leaving no doubt why she is one of the most successful and famous actresses of her generation.

            "content": "Raise the red Lantern or The Skull of the Master\n\nWhile watching Zhang Yimou's \"Raise the red lantern\", I was briefly reminded of two other films, films that have little to no narrative connection with this one, but, in some sense, display some linguistic similarities: Ingmar Bergman's \"Cries and Whispers\" and Peter Greenaway's \"The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover\", both great films in their own right. \n\nOn one hand, like in the case of Peter Greenaway's work(in general), the first way to get a handle on this film, is by following its craftsmanship. \"Raise the Red Lantern\" is not only a film of great beauty, but such a precisely executed one, that you can almost see the entire story through its shots, composition and use of color. Yes, unlike Greenaway's work, this film lacks the multiple references to art, because it does not need them. But there is a perfection in nearly each take, that hinds the eye of a trained painter(which Greenaway was).\n\nAnd to continue with this parallel, while the opening act has its share of irony, it does necessarily follow that path and here is where Bergman came to mind: for all its beauty, the film is very cold, like most Bergman's works. And like most Bergman's films, this one revolves around close spaces, one might actually say that it is some sort of a Chinese chamber drama. And like \"Cries and whispers\", one can also look at the film through the way its protagonists interact. Oh, and let's not forget the haunting red present in both films.\n\nBut these parallels, indeed, are accidental and maybe too subjective.  \n\nAs I said before, there is a strong contrast between the film's imagery and the film's overall atmosphere. Between the vivid and the livid. Outside its outer beauty, \"Raise the red lantern\" might be a rather unpleasant encounter. Outside a sense of grief and despair, Zhang Yimou's has crafted a beautifully, yet deliberated lifeless film. \n\nIn China, the red lanterns, among other things, are a symbol of joy(it is also, in some cases, a symbol of grief, but not in this context), but no one in this film seems even remotely happy., nor would they have a reason to be, for that matter.\n\nSome of this is hinted from the very first act, in which there is a line revolving around women's feet and how important are they to her health and her further ability... to serve. \n\nAnother aspect that held my interest was the invisible male protagonist. Yes, I know, formally he is present, but we don't really get to have a good look at him, nor does he say something  that would make him stand out. Of course, this is not the first character to be depicted in this fashion, but in most cases, such an approach prefaces a character wrapped in mystery. Here, the male protagonist is wrapped in irrelevance. We don't get to see him, because there is nothing to see. The few lines he has are bordering on the predictable and uninteresting. So, for a master - of any kind - he is woefully unremarkable. \n\n\nAnd, since I don't like spoilers, I leave you with my conclusion and a Wikipiedia quote, that might be useful later on: overall, this is a masterful film, one that can grow on you, one that, in spite being cold and lifeless, doesn't lack insight.\n\n\"The Red Lanterns were the women's fighting groups organized by village women who were not allowed to join the men's groups during the Boxer Uprising of 1900. Villagers said these women had supernatural powers and were called upon to perform tasks which the male Boxers could not.\"(Source: Wikipedia)",

It's film based on details and one must pay a lot of attention to fully understand what's going on. Raise the Red Lantern is one of these atmosphere films, calm on the surface but holding a storm of emotions on the inside and a vibrant study of the female condition in China prior to the cultural revolution.",

We never see the face of the husband.\n\nThe story held my interest.  Although there is apparently a lot of sex going on; the film is rated PG.  The sex is hinted at; but not depicted in even a remote manner.\n\nWife number 4 is Songlian (Gong Li).  She is a very capable actress; and drop-dead gorgeous.  Her beauty may have helped hold my interest.\n\nThe sets and costuming were elaborate and very well done.",

            "content": "I've seen many films from Asia, however, I've never been as impressed as I was with \"Raise the Red Lantern\". Filmed at a time where Wong-Kar Wai was getting lots of praise for creating movies that dealt with modern issues beautifully, director Zhang Yimou instead resorts back to the good old fashioned period piece with \"Raise the Red Lantern\". The film, which takes place in the 1920's, shows us a world where a man of high regime marries multiple women at a time. Our focus is Songlian (Gong Li), a 19-year old girl who decides to become one of the newest concubines. She immediately clashes with the other three wives, and soon the high life gets to her head. Zhang Yimou's direction is top-notch here. Instead of resorting to too many melodramatic tendencies like this film could, he instead gives us small doses that keep us interested but not overwhelmed. The film itself is slow paced, and beautiful-- the cinematography bursts with reds and oranges that reflect the romanticism but eerie undertones of the film-- but once we begin to understand the situation, and the female lead, the more we begin to dislike them. Gong Li's performance is exquisite: her character's changes from naive to spoiled to completely mad is so perfect that it challenges France's own Catherine Deneuve's famous title as the prime \"ice maiden\". But what Yimou wants us to do is to cringe at what's happening-- he doesn't want us to like anything that's going on. And that's what makes \"Raise the Red Lantern\" so interesting-- we don't really like anything about it except looking at it, but it pulls us in deep. With Li's magnetism and beauty, and Yimou's manipulative touch, it seems that foreign films have never been this ruthless, or this truthful. Highly recommended.",

Director Zhang Yimou exhaustively captures the pomp and circumstance of every tradition, beautifully juxtaposing this grandeur with the desperate plight of the concubines. He shows that under all the bizarre foot massages and the ceremonial lighting of the lanterns, there is a group woman eagerly laying in wait for the master to come and bestow upon them his light. \nConfined to grounds of this temple, or what seems like a very small prison, he captures both the elegance and the crippling confinement that these women call home. Even in this isolated & relatively small space, Yimou makes the stakes feel so high.\nFor me it was an unexpected delight and a film I will not soon forget.",

Acting is perfect, the atmosphere is somewhat surreal and in the end it feels macabric and depressive. Still it's something what is quite natural for Yimou Zhang, just perhaps stronger than in most of his other movies. 'Raise the Red Lantern' is a masterpiece of film-making, and considering the fact it was made 24 years ago (it's not such a short time in the fast developing world of technologies) it is even more stunning.

The customs oppress them to the extent that they have very little room left for compassionate interactions with others.\n\nTaking customs as given and immutable, they fight against each other to survive and thrive. The fights among themselves leave them no time nor strength to question the customs themselves - let alone to turn against those customs. Their minds are fully occupied by thoughts about people around them, and have absolutely no concepts about the structure that governs their interactions.\n\nI didn't find the film very realistic or insightful at all. It is too operatic, too exaggerated, too artificially tragic, to give us much insight about the reality of Chinese society at that time. We see the characters only as pitiful victims of cruelty (imposed both by the structure and people). Yes, they have emotions and personalities, but they don't seem to have goals, or wishes, or a will at all. We see Songlian, the main character, through five seasons, and yet at the end of the film we still don't know what she wants. She remains as incomprehensible as ever.",
