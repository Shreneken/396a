Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case and that Starling, as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to draw him out.",

But, as a trans person, I still love this movie. It helps to remember that, more than trying to be a woman, Bill is trying to transcend all of humanity, because like most serial killers, he hates himself more than anything and would rather be anything else. It could've been more explicit, but it's still a compelling antagonist. \n\nOther than that, the story is tight, the cinematography is gorgeous, and every actor is putting 110% into their roles.

There is absolutely no need for him to reference Marcus Aurelius or even 'first principles' in helping out Clarice with her investigation and her reading list.  Marcus Aurelius is barely a philosopher and Stoicism is barely a philosophy, at least if you are anything more than a patrician decadent or a modern moody teenager.  Why would a true intellectual, as he shows himself to be in Hannibal, need to be so didactic and pretentious that he has to inquire, 'you know Florence?' based on his sketch of the Duomo as seen from the Belvedere?  That's like asking if you know New York when you know the Statue of Liberty as seen from the Freedom Tower.  \nCome on; you can do better than that, Lecter.",

The locations are surprisingly very memorable as well. The music is super low key but incredibly intense and matches with this steady building unique thriller/horror hybrid.

            "content": "I like the contrast between Will Graham from Manhunter and Clarice Starling from The Silence of the Lambs. Will is the gifted FBI agent who captured Hannibal Lecter. Will is past his prime and comes out of retirement to hunt a serial killer named the Tooth Fairy. In SOTL, Hannibal has been imprisoned in the Baltimore Insane Asylum for eight years. Hannibal has a long history that we only see a glimpse of. \n\n\nFor years he worked as a cannibalistic psychiatrist who would kill murderers, sex criminals, and rude people. Dexter owes a lot to Hannibal. Compared to Will, Clarice is more of an underdog. She's a young, female FBI trainee who is in constant danger. She has to deal with insane criminals, Hannibal's mind games, and a murderer who targets women. When Clarice gets in the elevator at the FBI headquarters she is dwarfed by the other agents. Although she's in shape, she is not physically imposing and must rely on her wits, smarts, and charm to capture a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. \n\n\nClarice is the vessel in which the audience experiences the story. She's the pathway to a much larger world. Based on the book by Thomas Harris, The Silence of the Lambs is all about mood and it's a mood that Johnathan Demme captures exquisitely. From the first scene of Clarice jogging through the woods, the audience tries to grasp the sinister world around them. Jodie Foster is perfectly cast as Clarice. Foster has the right amount of toughness, intelligence, and sensitivity. She's instantly believable as a proactive character who is driven by justice. \n\n\nShe wants the promotion that capturing Buffalo Bill will bring her, and Hannibal instantly sees this about her. The whole film is a cat-and- mouse game of quid pro quo. You have to give A to get B. The film burns through a lot of story but never seems rushed or too slow. FBI agent Jack Crawford assigns Clarice to talk with Hannibal about a diagnostic questionnaire. In reality, Jack wants Hannibal to reveal info about Buffalo Bill but Clarice can't approach the infamous cannibal with an agenda.\n\n\nFBI agents are great characters. Mulder, Scully, Dale Cooper: we like these agents because they get stuff done. They're action prone and they drive the story. Dr. Chilton is the fame-loving jerk who runs the asylum. But its Crawford and Starling who handle things. Demme paints the Baltimore Asylum as a dark place. By the time Clarice walks past the deeply disturbed criminals, seeing Hannibal standing there quietly is a relief. \n\n\nHannibal is the secret weapon of the movie and he's used in just the right amount. The appeal of Hannibal is his manners. He has a code of conduct. Hannibal is also a genius which makes him scary. The beauty of Silence is that its villain verse villain. Hannibal knows how Buffalo Bill thinks. And just when we think that Hannibal's cooperation might bring him some redemption, he escapes from custody. \n\n\nWhy does the Scorpion kill the Frog? Because it is his nature. Anthony Hopkins is inspired casting. I can't imagine anyone else who can chew scenery and be terrifying like he does. This cast fires on all cylinders. There's a scene where Crawford presents Hannibal with a BS transfer offer that will allow him to walk on the beach. When we learn that the offer is false we feel bad for Hannibal. So much for quid pro quo. \n\n\nSeeking revenge, Hannibal escapes in brutal but genius fashion. Hannibal escapes by cutting off a cop's face, wearing it over his own, and leaving in an ambulance. In the final scene of the movie, Hannibal finishes his phone call with Clarice and then walks on the beach. Demme holds this shot of the beach through the entirety of the closing credits. In the end, Hannibal got what Crawford promised him.\n\n\nThere's one continuity error in the film. When Clarice finds the head of Benjamin Raspail in the storage, Hannibal says that he did not kill him. The implication is that Buffalo Bill killed Raspail because they were lovers, and Bill was jealous that Raspail was also involved with Klaus. Raspail was Hannibal's patient and often told Hannibal things about Buffalo Bill. In the other movies, its revealed that Hannibal killed Raspail, Buffalo Bill killed Klaus, and that it's Klaus's head that Clarice finds in the storage. \n\n\nRather than include all that exposition, the movie skips over Klaus completely and swaps him out with Raspail as Buffalo Bill's victim. Clarice does some great detective work in this scene. When Hannibal tells her to \"look within yourself\" she concludes that \"Your-Self\" is a storage facility in Baltimore. She also figures out that Miss Hester Mofet is an anagram for \"The Rest of Me\" which means that Hannibal owns the storage.\n\n\nClarice also discovers the moth-in-the-mouth and how it represents transitioning. Clarice is an exceptional junior agent. When she finally kills Buffalo Bill it's because she hears the hammer of the gun click in the pitch-dark house. Clarice is the FBI. Manhunter is a good film which establishes that Hannibal is a killer that helps the FBI catch other killers but only if he wants to. The film Hannibal is mostly terrible. Clarice should never be the one hunting Hannibal. They work best in the strange bedfellows dynamic. \n\n\nRed Dragon is decent but unnecessary because it's the same story as Manhunter and Manhunter did it better. Hannibal Rising is also terrible and provides an origin story that no one wanted or needed. At the 64th Academy Awards, The Silence of the Lambs won the big five: that's Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Adapted Screenplay. Only two other films have done this. \n\n\nIt's nice when the Academy gets it right and it's huge for a genre film to get that much praise. But Silence is a great story that takes the source material seriously. It's a sharp, suspenseful thriller that never crosses the line of gore and disgust. Peter Travers said it best, \"Silence proves that a movie can be mercilessly scary and mercifully humane at the same time.\"",

Its cast, including Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter and Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, deliver exceptional performances that have cemented their place in the history of cinema. The film is expertly directed by Jonathan Demme, who uses close-ups and leering gazes to create an intimate and uncomfortable atmosphere that puts the viewer in the shoes of the protagonist. The script and direction are efficient in moving the complex story and character arcs forward, ensuring that there are rarely dull moments. The Silence of the Lambs is a perfect example of the crossover between drama, thriller, and horror, with both the viscerally horrific scenes featuring Buffalo Bill and the psychological horror of Lecter's interrogations of Clarice being equally disturbing.",

No matter how many times you see this film, it will scare you and you will never get tired of it. Jonathan Demme's direction is, of course, a shining example of adaptation. Jodie Foster's performance as Clarice, who is psychologically taken advantage of in her first meeting with Dr. Lecter, is very realistic. Not to be forgotten is Anthony Hopkins.

The story from start to finish is enthralling, and the script is tense and thought-provoking.\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs is wonderfully acted as well. Jodie Foster is the one who holds the film together and her performance here is one of her most excellent, and I mustn't forget Ted Levine who is very chillingly effective as Buffolo Bill. Anthony Hopkins however steals the film, it is his perhaps most iconic character and he proves that although he is in only a portion of the film his performance lives long in the memory.\n\nAll in all, amazing. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Does not rely not sheer visual shock alone, it will get under your skin through its disturbing unhinged dialogue that is ever believable through its viscerally immersive cast. It draws you in and keeps you hooked all the way through. Easily one of the best movies.",

I could praise many things about The Silence of the Lambs, but instead I'll list of my one big flaw in the film which is that it's age sometimes sneaks through. (Yes, it came out in the 90s, but it was still 31 years ago!) Editing and a particular scene involving the biting of a face should be enough evidence for that reasoning.",
