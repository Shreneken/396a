Composite thematic elements leap out in unexpected places and just as quickly recede into the void before we're able to detect coherent meaning behind the quirky and mercurial story. This may frustrate viewers intent on making sense of what they are seeing, but it will impress those who appreciate writing that pulls out all of the stops and operates according to its own defiantly unorthodox rules. There is, in fact, a sense that the film is an exercise in rebellion against the established tenets of traditional narrative, yet it clearly springs from a whirlpool of engaging and relevant ideas. In short, \"Barton Fink\" is nothing if not wholly original, and is sure to prove a favorite among those who are drawn to the Coen brothers' most outrageously eccentric qualities.",

However, upon arrival, he finds himself with a case of writer's block, trapped in an overheated hotel room filled with mosquitos, with the only hope of manifesting his Hollywood dream being a picture of a young girl at the beach that hangs from his wall.  Directed by Joel Coen, it's a darkly humorous look at failed dreams.  The script, written by the Coen brothers, is filled with sharp dialogue, intriguing characters and interesting scenarios. Cinematographer Roger Deakins bathes each scene in a sepia-like light, effectively capturing the feel of the 1940s.  The only possible quibble one could have with the movie is the surreal scene involving the hotel fire at the end of the film, which feels a bit out of place, but it remains another finely etched film from the brothers.",

When they brought in the two detectives to investigate a murder it started to seem like they were piling things on to intentionally obfuscate the genre and meaning of the movie, but they didn't do it in a way that seemed smarmy & egocentric like Lynch's Mulholland Drive did.

            "content": "A mind bending journey into the mind of a screenwriter.\n\nJoel Coen's neo-noir, psychological drama, black comedy Barton Fink (1991) contains multitudes of ideas, styles, and entertainment. I found Barton Fink to be captivating in director Joel Coen's eerie atmosphere and haunting depiction of Hollywood. John Turturro is both pathetically sad as a narcissist scriptwriter as well as funnily naive and how out of his element he constantly is in every scene. You believe Barton Fink is losing his mind due to stress, anxieties, and deadlines. I must mention the unforgettable force of nature that is John Goodman. His hardy and hearty Charlie Meadows. Goodman delivers lines like Joel Coen is holding a gun to his head with a particularly brilliant display of fearsome dramatic acting in the finale.\n\nJoel Coen's direction is dark and serious for The Coen Brothers, but he never loses focus on portraying old Hollywood. He grips you with a character study of a loser writer and all the emotionally broken people around Hollywood in similar situations. Judy Davis' frustrated and loveless Audrey Taylor is as tragic as John Mahoney's drunken writing legend W.P. Mayhew was wasting his writing talents within a bottle. Michael Lerner's screaming studio head Jack Lipnick is a riot as he desperately tries to pull a script out of Barton Fink with his raw charisma and supportive front. Jon Polito's Lou Breeze is dehumanized into being a loyal lackey to Lipnick with no dignity as a man or creative. Tony Shalhoub's producer Ben Geisler thinks he knows how to run things, but he's still subservient to Lipnick too. Even Steve Buscemi's content hotel concierge and bellboy Chet only lives to serve Hollywood types like Barton Fink.\n\nRoger Deakins' cinematography captures the hopelessness creatives feel in movie making with touching close-up shots to striking dream sequences like wide shots like the flaming hotel hallway in Barton Fink's unreal finale. Barton Fink is as well shot as Miller's Crossing or Fargo in all honesty. Joel Coen and Ethan Coen's editing skills are as sharp as ever with a steady pacing that draws you into the mad world of moviemaking for 117 chilling minutes.\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen's writing contains all manner of literary references and allusions to real writers or Hollywood figures. Barton Fink is fascinating as on one hand it's about the struggles of aspiring writers to overcome writer's block, find inspiration, and create something new and authentic, while being commercially successful in Hollywood's stifling corporate environment, wherein you are just another writer to them. Dennis Gassner's grimey production design shows how ugly and gross L.A. looks in his wretched set designs, while Carter Burwell's haunting score rises to the insanity of the filmmaking world with melodic shotgun blasts of sound.\n\nOn the other hand, Barton Fink is about how maddening writer's block and living in L.A. can be for young writers, especially in the brutally honest and cutthroat world of Hollywood. Thus, Barton Fink accomplishes the drama of showing how egotistical writers can be who are not speakers of their generation, nor voices of the common man and how crushing that realization can be for the author. In addition to the soul crushing world of Hollywood, Barton Fink parodies and satirizes how absurd writing for Hollywood is as Barton is ushered around from producer to studio head with no direction or real creative support. \n\nSo, Barton Fink ends up hilariously satirizing both writers and studio figures in serious critiques of how toxic this environment is for creatives, while remaining a downright delightful black comedy of Hollywood's absurdities.",

            "content": "In true Coen Brothers fashion, we get a film with fantastic characters and a strange, sometimes bizarre, plot â€” we also get John Goodman, John Turturro, and Steve Buscemi. Barton Fink follows Barton Fink (Turturro), an NYC playwright who takes a job in L.A. to write (lucrative) B-Movie scripts. When Barton arrives in L.A., it's as if he enters a new world, entirely. I'm a sucker for creepy, art-deco styled hotels â€” which are abundant in the city of angels â€” but it's more than just the lodging here that makes the city interesting. Every character Barton meets is fast-talking, charismatic, or just a little off, or a combination of two or three. In this area, I especially enjoyed Mr. Lipnick (Michael Lerner), Mr. Geiser (Tony Shalhoub), Detective Mastrionatti (Richard Portnow), Detective Deutsch (Christopher Murney), Goodman as Charlie and, although only in a few scenes, Buscemi as Chet. Early in the film, Barton passionately expels the virtues of \"the common man\" while continuing to cut off Charlie â€” a traveling insurance salesman, the epitome of the 1940s \"common man\" â€” from sharing \"some stories\". I think the film would've benefitted more from exploring this angle and its relevance to today's growing disdain for \"coastal elites\" who not only believe they know better than everyone else, but know better for everyone else. While I knew something was off with Charlie pretty early on, I didn't like the direction of the plot (not really a twist) or the ending. The ambiguous ending gives hard Hotel California \"you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave\" vibes, especially paired with Lipnick's perpetual contract (this is illegal btw, but I won't let my lawyer show) and the girl on the beach, but extended to all of Los Angeles. Barton Fink has fantastic camerawork and a very cool scene concerning the Bible. It also has one of my favorite lines in cinema: \"Jesus, throw a rock in here and you'll hit [a writer]. And do me a favor, Fink, throw it hard.\" (As I writer, I'm allowed to say this.) I'd bet if you asked a cinephile to name favorite Coen Brothers' movies, Barton Fink wouldn't even make the top 5â€“7, but it's a wonderful film only a solid ending away from cracking the (90)s.",

            "content": "John Turturro has had the strangest career. He has substantial roles in iconic films that established cinema giants like Spike Lee and the Coen Brothers, but cut to 20 years later he's mostly known for playing the most annoying character in film history in Michael Bay's Transformers movies (and probably cashed his biggest paycheck from those, as well). He and John Goodman are polar opposites in terms of career progression as character actors. But Barton Fink has got to be his career defining performance: a morbidly comic search for meaning, artistic expression, romantic satisfaction, and security that is jam-packed full of allegory and symbolism that functions largely due to the manic nervousness that Turturro brings to the character. It's almost a shame that he has to share the screen with Goodman, who is often completely absorbing and fantastic, taking attention away from the lead's contributions at times (not that removing Goodman from the film would actually be a good idea). The carciatures of the Hollywood stereotypes, from the studio executive with a flair for fast-talking and flash, to the laconic, Bogart-esque cops full of anachronistic quips, the film operates as a wonderful criticism of the peculirites of Hollywood, which made it a shoe-in for critical uccess that it still enjoys. The final half-hour, with its surreal imagery and wide range of interpretations, is entirely unexpected and wonderful. Expanding the Coenverse, maybe this provides a bit of background as to where Walter Sobchak sources his ready-made supply of body parts. (4.5/5)",

He moves to Hollywood to work on a movie and writes it but decided he didn't want to live the Hollywood lifestyle and decided to stay at a low-class hotel while he worked on his story. He made friends with his neighbor and Barton's stories become inspired after Charlie's true identity is revealed and things don't go as expected when he finishes due to the comeuppance done to him by charlie. A shot of interest is from 1:08:00-1:10:10 because it makes you think why did the coens zoom into the sink drain and it was a foreshadow of what was going to occur as you see later in the clip what the screams might have been. That clip is one of the most interesting of the most. I rate Barton Fink a 4 because it did have an impactful theme and was really entertaining. The way the Coen brothers had their character choice was great because it really fit them. Towards the end where charlie burns the floor, he and Barton stayed on showed condescension he had on Barton. The way they used to foreshadow and a lot of interesting factors like the zoom in to the drain or the chick from the poster in the room appearing at the end was great.",

Barton starts off as a New York playwright, but he receives an offer to Hollywood which puts a glitch in his \"common man\" algorithm. Barton's work is all about the common man, but the story takes a turn when he finds himself checked into a hotel where he meets his new friend Charlie and seems to be incapable of recognizing the common man. The best part of this film is Baton's multiple encounters with W.P. (a drunk) and his wife Audrey, but especially Audrey and her dead body which is where we see a huge shift in the plot. W.P. is the writer Barton doesn't want to become, but that can be easily contradicted because W.P. doesn't listen due to his drunk behavior and Barton doesn't listen due to the intoxication of his own thoughts and this gets Barton into lots of conflicting trouble.",

Next they were close starting friends until later on found the truth about Charlie making Barton go out of his mind of not knowing what to do with himself all alone because he going through bad times and not Barton aware of it what really going on. My favorite part is when Charlie told Barton that he is leaving Los Angeles to New York and Barton beseech him to stay that he is the only person he knows that can help him through this time and Charlies telling him it's all going to be okay and that he got this, don't talk to anybody. I love this part because Charlie as the character is stalwart  and apoplectic  in away by seeing the good for Barton by giving him idea by thinking of story and stilling knowing what going on but have that bond making sure he okay at the same time end of the film.",

The film revolves around this writer named Barton Fink who made it to LA too write his first film of wrestling, after arriving Barton is stationed in this dilapidated hotel that brought many problems. Barton's boss Jack Lipnick acts rather bipolar or condescension, after the first few scenes in the hotel Barton meets his neighbor Charlie which already gave me bad vibes at the beginning later on they became the best of friends. When an unexpected death happens in Bartons room lingering questions start to be solved like how Charlie is Mad Man Munt a serial killer and burns down the hotel in the end but leaves Barton alive, finally finishing Bartons script after many writers block it is neglected by Lipnick and the movie then comes to an end. This film was pretty slow and unappealing to me which is a reason why its getting the rating that I stated, one of the interesting scenes is when Charlie finally reveals himself at the somewhat of the end of the film and kills the 2 detectives that had Barton at questioning. This was the start of the action that would later come and this is why it's an important scene and an interesting one.

            "content": "The film, Barton Fink follows around a New York play writer and creator named Barton Fink. After one of his new plays debut he is offered a contract to write movies at Capital Pictures in Los Angeles. However, when he is trying to write his script based off his assignment, he suffers writer's block and no matter what he tries to do in his hotel room, he can't write. During this period at the hotel, we are introduced to Fink's neighbor named Charlie. Charlie sees that Barton has writer's block and does whatever he can to help Barton. From teaching him wrestling to giving him life advice, Charlie becomes a friend to Barton. After meeting his writing idol and his secretary, Barton goes to them for any work-related need but still continues to struggle putting his story together. After a very strange turn of events, Barton has to deal with inner challenges as he tries to write the perfect script to be used in the pictures. \n\n     My favorite scene from the movie begins at 1:39:27 when two detectives are looking throughout the hotel and interrogating Barton to find Charlie, and Charlie appears from the elevator and a chase scene in a way begins. The reason why this is my favorite scene from the movie is because of how it reminds me of my favorite scene from Miller's Crossing. My favorite scene from Miller's Crossing is when Leo single-handedly took down two members of Caspar's gang. This scene satirizes one of the best parts of Leo's scene which was the fire, however it is used in different ways. In Miller's Crossing, the fire is used as a sign for Leo to know that something is wrong versus in Barton Fink, the fire is used as a sign of magical realism. The fire in the background when Charlie starts charging the detectives with the gun and it's even more well used because as Charlie gets more intense and angry the fire gets larger and grows rapidly. As Charlie kills both detectives not only as a way to protect himself, but I think he risks turning himself in for Barton, which is why I enjoy this scene more. This hidden meaning that Charlie comes back to kill the detectives not only for himself but to save the reputation of Barton Fink, because any association between the two of them could be the end of Barton's career. This also shows how much Barton means to Charlie because despite the fact that Barton never truly listens to Charlie, those interactions meant a lot to him and he was ready to do anything for his friend, which is why this scene is both powerful and my favorite, because you don't see a relationship like this anymore in 2020 or in movies. \n\n\tI would give this movie a 3 out of 5 overall. The reason I would give this movie a 3 star rating because there were multiple scenes that I enjoyed a lot and had lots of deep hidden meanings that were powerful, but overall the plot line was very confusing. Like I said, there were some powerful hidden meanings, like no matter who you are in life or what you do, there will always be someone there for you, or it brings up the daunting paradox, that in your dream career, there are going to be times when you fail. Like I said before when talking about my favorite scene, when Charlie took on those two detectives or when Charlie and Barton were debating on what to do with the dead body of Audrey and what their story on what happened to her should be. Besides these two scenes there were a lot of confusing plot points, such as the cut to Barton celebrating and dancing happily at the USO Party. The reason why it was so confusing because it was a quick cut from a shot of Barton using the tears and death of his new lover to write his script for his movie. What makes it so confusing is that we the audience have no idea how'd he got invited to that party and why he is so happy after a death so close to him. I know most people who've gotten big projects completed shortly after a death, but they were still completely upset. The other main confusing scene, is why did Barton go to the beach for the final scene of the movie? We never saw Barton go to the beach or talk about going to the beach, the only beach related thing we the audience see is the postcard in his hotel room and the transition of the waves crashing on a rock on the beach. So to me it was really confusing, and unlike the first three films of the Coen Brothers, in which their hidden meanings were a little more clear and they didn't have any mystery scenes that were out of nowhere. The fact that they put these in just blurred the theme of the film and the entire plot of the film because if you end on a scene with no previous context the audience, including myself, are left to wonder, what just happened, in a confusing way. And in my opinion, the only time to say what just happened is after an epic action movie where it had a major plot twist, not a confusing ending, which is why I would give this movie a 3 out of 5.",

It's about a writer who moves to Los Angeles and gets a job to writer a script for a B-movie as he tries to write the script he gets writer's block and distracted with the chaos happening in his life. In the beginning of the film i was pretty bored because it wasn't really catching my eye i was more focus on my phone but when Barton got to the hotel it started catching my attention. One of my favorite scenes from the movie was when Barton met Charlie just because it was so weird how it went from a sound complain to them bonding in Barton room. Charlie being next door was the portent to the film in my opinion just because that's when chaos started to happen. But the scene that left an indelible expression on me was when Charlie comes back from hiding and saves barton from going to jail by shooting the detectives and creating a fire.",

            "content": "Barton Fink remains a masterpiece as far as filmmaking & narrative conventions go. Just as entertaining and unmistakably crafted with ambitions not just far higher than what could have been, \"good enough,\" for mainstream audiences or Studio executives...but also with the signature Coen Bros. feeling in every moment of every scene, every line of dialogue and the sets used to Kubrickian levels of perfection. \n  \nNo character has a small part, no extras are considered extras - as we've seen over the past few decades, the Coen Brothers ALWAYS make damn sure to pay just as much attention to detail (again just as Kubrick made The Shining the best horror film ever made by making such elaborate sets that had to be as close to the real fictional Overlook setting in the story). This is how their films hook you in with a sense of unique immersion, where we all feel personally served a special production that caters to our own idiosyncrasies. They do this by writing endless variations of eccentric main characters that we love to watch without ever stopping to wonder if we should be rooting for them, hoping they aren't kept from getting what their seek in whatever twisted yet morbidly accurate representation of the real world & our own societies they spiral around in throughout the whole film, usually running in place more often than not. \n   \nJohn Ford was amazing. Billy Wilder is one of the best directors ever. Period. But even those legendary filmmakers could never make movies that satisfy the audience completely in the first hour without even advancing the plot beyond the first act, and then using the second hour to treat you to a number cleverly sharp turns to disorient you, all before high tailing it to the credits in a comedy of errors - quite literally - where the stakes are always shuffling around for every face still on screen. Some get presented as the unlikely hero for an hour, but then they get killed with a hammer off screen in the final 30 seconds and we only hear that's what happened to them through a lighting fast, hysterically delivered exposition between characters we likely have no connection to at all until that moment. (Burn After Reading.) \n  \nLife is absurd. So their movies don't just operate with absurd stories. They play it honest and true to reality. The characters always seem like cartoon personalities, quirky for comedic purposes, and then suddenly one of them says something they shouldn't have & a mob boss orders the protagonist to execute the guy who is also a friend of the protagonist, resulting in a sharp turn from quirky comic relief B role performance to suddenly the most gut wrenching, heart pounding scene in their entire filmography, as Tuturro's big mouthed chatterbox uses around all five minutes of a single tracking shot to talk his way out of being hit by this mob enforcer who, again, is a guy he's always known and has no personal issues with. These all amount to cinematic masterpieces as isolated scenes in their body of work but also serve as small examples to prove that every scene in each of their films is loaded with significance, as well as being told in different ways that you've likely never seen done before until now. \n  \nBarton Fink is just as insane as the Big Lebowski, but the former has very believably serious stakes for the central character who wants to prove himself a writer by moving to Hollywood after succeeding on Broadway already. Lebowski is literally about a man child stoner who likes to go bowling, and one day some people think he's another guy but the same last name creates confusion - so for a few hours we watch Jeff Bridges & John Goodman go vigilante in LA to get justice after some henchmen urinated on the wrong Lebowski's (Bridges) area rug in a modest low income housing apartment...you see how these are weird in different ways, and neither would sound amazing if you hadn't seen trailers or known who the Coens were etc. But I found out I DID care enough to watch Jeff Bridges bowl, drink, take some drugs, cremate his bowling buddy who never shut the fuck up, and then there's Tara Reid's offer to blow him for cash, a butler played by a late great Hollywood megastar of an actor, fight some European nihilists who emphatically remind everyone they care about nozing!!! They eat in n out burger, Goodman draws his old Desert Storm service pistol on a registered sex offender/pedophile IN A BOWLING ALLEY, (but not because the guy is a sex offender; he's upset they scheduling of their tournament doesn't respect his recently adopted Jewish traditions that his ex wife supposedly once cared about...?).  \n  \nAND YET ALL OF THESE COEN FILMS IVE MENTIONED ARE BETTER THAN SOME GREAT DIRECTOR'S BEST WORK. I don't think James Cameron has ever made a film as good as a Coen Bros flick, and if he did, the only argument would be for Aliens. Everything else is just trash by comparison, (and a lot of Cameron's stuff is trash even without comparing it to other people's  work. Like, it's criminal how much he's touted by the Academy for such awful films when nominated next to actually great cinema. Good Will Hunting lost Best Picture because James Cameron filmed a boat sinking for 3 hours that also had the fake Hollywood cheese lovestory somehow happen in 3 hours during a life or death crisis...don't get my started on The Abyss. It never looked good, it's awful, and Avatar looks so pathetically bad for how hard it wants to impress you with its visual neon Ferngully narrative. Sorry, James Cameron is - at best - a lower tier/Michael Bay level director who is also an asshole & no actors are willing to work with him based on his reputation & shitty films.) \n  \nBut Coen Bros? They're the anti-Cameron. Go go go!",

And that's really what Barton Fink is about, a writer who can't figure out his story. Just the fact that this seemingly small problem is what this epic film centers around is mind blowing in and of itself. You think you know what's going on when you really don't, your mind wanders off and creates these complex hypotheticals. As the story unfolds, you start crossing off your long list of guesses until you are left clueless for about 2 minutes, then it suddenly clicks.\n\nIf I were to describe this film with one word it would be eerie. From the hotel staff to the tearing wall paper to Charlie's weird patterns of speech, the movie is just plain eerie; and this is what makes it so captivating. Everytime Barton struggles to start writing his opening words, you feel as if there is a heavy weight attached to your heart and it's you who can't put ink to paper. The film starts by making you feel uncomfortable at first, then clueless, and finally leaves you astonished.\n\nTurturro and Goodman are as compatible of a pair as the Coen brothers; it really is these two pairings that carry the film. \n\nIf you are a lover of dramadies (drama comedies) give this a watch. If you are a lover of film, watch this. If you've got nothing to do on a Friday night take out that large bucket of rocky road ice cream, snuggle up, and enjoy the show.",

In 1991 they treated us to Barton Fink a story revolving around the titular character. Fink is a successful playwright from New York and he is one day given an offer from Hollywood to be paid a thousand dollars each week for writing scripts. Fink makes his way out and stays at a strange hotel. The movie showcases barton's constant writers block as he thinks about the essence of theater, life and the crazy people he meets in out west.\nThe coen brothers always have a bizarre but uniquely funny touch to their films. The film is highly unusual but for some reason it grabbed me enough for me to continue watching all the way through. this story was scripted like something out of a woody allen film but again they add their own touch to it. it does make you think about the different kind of writers in Hollywood and how certain events can shape their screenwriter minds.\nI rather enjoyed this character Barton Fink. John Turturro did an excellent job with this unsual character. I couldn't help but laugh so much at this man's hair at was so weird. Fink is a man that cares deeply about the essence of theater and acting and finds himself fighting against the ways of Hollywood and its effect on the common man. jack lerner was the best part of the film. If one finds himself bored within the first few minutes lerner's jack lipnick will wake you the hell up! so much vibrance and hilarity it is sensational! John goodman did a fine job here as yet another strange character with slim to no eyebrows. his chemistry with turturro is uncanny every scene they nailed together even the crazy climax of the film\nthat painting is so prominent in the film its almost like another character. same with all of the sounds in the film there is such a heavy reliance on the element of visual painting and sound. very well composed score. the cinematography was great as well. the long shots of the hallway and closeups of barton were exquisitely done.\n\tBarton Fink is a definitely vintage coen brothers and anyone who is a fan of their work will find this to be tremendous.",

Barton checks into a hotel for a little privacy, and finds that he is frequently distracted by flies buzzing around his room, the constant peeling wallpaper, and most importantly: an extremely loud neighbour who can't seem to leave him alone. This is one of the Coen Brothers' more underrated films that sadly doesn't get talked about enough, and without spoiling anything, this film goes to some dark places in very unexpected ways with multiple ways to interpret the events that take place. The film stars Coen regulars such as John Turturro, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi; with Turturro and Goodman giving stellar performances as Barton and the neighbour respectively. Their interactions begin innocent-enough; Barton fascinated by his blue-collar tales of being a traveling insurance salesman, but things take a sharp turn when we realize that Goodman's character is not who he says he is. This film is filled to the brim with visual and metaphorical symbolism, with an ending that still divides critics as to the true meaning. It's very difficult to discuss this film without spoiling the experience, so I will simply end by recommending this film highly for Coen Brothers completionists and for fans of the principle actors' work!",

In Fink's Hollywood, talented writers are taken in, chewed up, and spit out until they resemble very little of what made them good in the first place. It's also incredibly allegorical, referencing a number of biblical people and themes. Like most Coen movies, the writing is superb, with even the side players getting fleshed out.

I don't like when I have to do homework and analyze a film in order to fathom the writers' intentions, in fact I hate it. Some slight symbolism that might add some depth to the story when you look more closely is a fine thing to insert into a film, and it might even make it a more intelligent movie which I would appreciate. However Barton Fink wanders into a strange fantastical dimension where the laws of physics stop applying and people start saying things that make no sense, and suddenly I'm sitting there saying \"What in the world is happening right now?!\" It also kind of felt like the film was written and created just to appeal to the Hollywood artsy-fartsy crowd. It was so loaded with \"inside jokes\" that I could see other creative types just lapping it up but it sails right over my head. I didn't hate Barton Fink because, despite the rampant symbolic mumbo-jumbo, it did have a coherent story that I found entertaining at times.

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nThere is something about films exploring about the passions of an artist, placing in situations that would challenge them and hopefully show their true potential. Barton Fink achieves similarly to what David Lynch has brought for Mulholland Drive; we are treated to a dedicated and brilliant artist to a world that is first unknown to them, and as their stay in sunny Los Angeles lengthens, they start to see sides of not just the environment but also of themselves that was never shown before. In Barton Fink, directed by the Coen Brothers, it is much more tamed and focused as compared to Lynch's, but throughout it remains surreal and terrifying.\n\nHollywood has been attacked by many filmmakers, as the heart of artistic destruction. They say this is the place where it lures the hopeful minds of the outside world and once they entice you close enough; they would devour everything that you once stood for and eventually become an empty vessel to meet their corporate desires. What I just said is no doubt an exaggeration of the real thing, but it is nevertheless real; there is this sense of restriction when watching the product of a Hollywood film as compared to someone who produced it outside the major studios, as creative control is always present in regards to the latter. Barton Fink's journey is definitely an interesting one and the way the Coen brothers depict this man's internal struggle for wanting to create something profound but also to meet the demands of his employers is terrifyingly real, and it does so without resorting to melodrama, but instead uses a hint of dark humour to create the exaggerations in its plot. The scenes that sticks on my mind when recalling the film, are the ones that involve Barton sitting across from his employer as these moments are the ones that represent the show business so well; the feeling of manipulation and artificial sincerity is filled during these scenes and through that I was able to really engage with the film.\n\nMy core issue with the film is with the dire twist that pops up in the middle of the film, as though it drove the plot forward and elevated its pacing, I did however find it to be too exaggerated and at the moment thematically confusing. I wasn't able to pick on the intentions behind it and the complete change in perspective towards one of the characters in the film, did throw me off with the film's flow. It is far from being completely ridiculous or abysmal, as one can feel the Coen brothers trying to speak something intellectually penetrating but one does need all the pieces, which I was unable to completely grasp onto during the initial experience, in order to fully appreciate it.\n\nJohn Turturro's performance in this film was the best I have seen from the actor, and has completely changed my view of him. I used to only connect his acting work with the low-brow films of the Transformers franchise and Don't Mess With The Zohan, but after seeing him in films like Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink, it shows that even some of the most sell-out or worst of actors in the mainstream Hollywood business have films that showed a sense of integrity towards their craft. John Goodman has yet to disappoint me in any films he has worked on, and my adoration for him could be traced back to the lesser-known animation films he has done like The Emperor's New Groove. Goodman brings that presence in the room, and I say not just in regards to his physical stature, there is also emotional depth to his performance that could be felt throughout the film. The Coen brothers does not create obvious shots that would shape its characters, a lot of the time the camera is quite distant, especially the scenes between Turturro and Goodman, and through those there is subtle tension growing and at times we don't notice it because we are concerned with the words being spoken to create understanding rather than on what we see.\n\nBarton Fink on paper seems like a straight forward drama, but under the direction of the Coen brothers, it becomes much more; there is a sense of passion to its characters, subjects, and ideas, and told so in a way that is surreal and profound; pushing the boundaries of the audience's expectations. I hope the next film I see from the brothers would be as great as what I have just experienced.",

I feel it's irresponsible to leave interesting circumstances unanswered, to create a distorted film and hide behind the concept of calling it an art is a cheap shot of making an entertainment film.\nThe Coen Brother's \"A Serious Man\" however, is an exception because the movie itself was about the frustration of unanswered events and questioning coincidentally unlucky circumstances. \nThis movie however is more or less pointless! other than that, GREAT and talented ACTING!",

The film stars John Turturro, John Goodman, Judy Davis, Michael Lerner, Jon Polito, and Steve Buscemi.\r\n\r\nBarton Fink (Turturro) is a writer living in New York City. He is a play write who has just received lots of praise for his new play. An offer comes to him to come down to Los Angelis to write for a film making company. While experiencing writers block, Fink receives a knock at his apartment door. Behind it stands his new neighbor, Charlie Meadows (Goodman), a salesman. The two of them hit it off pretty well. Fink is the upstate writer with lots of awards and praise, Charlie is the average every man who lives simply. As Barton struggles to write his script, Charlie keeps paying him visits. They sit and talk about their lives. Unknown to Barton is aÃ‚Â terrible shocking truth.\r\n\r\nJohn Turturro and John Goodman are perfect in this film. The two of them have this chemistry that just lights you on fire. Their scenes together are priceless fun. That being said, the performances in this are all fantastic. The characters are quirky and very well written, as all Coen characters are. The film is wonderfully shot by Rodger Deakins. Each shot is inventive and looks good. The film is full to the brim of great clever humor, given to us by our leads. There's nothing I didn't like about this movie. It's perfect.\r\n\r\n\"Barton Fink'' is a bizarrely fantastic Coen brothers film. It's one of their best. The characters are great, the writing is phenomenal, the cinematography is sharp, the acting is superb, and it has an interesting ending. The film is driven by Goodman and Turturro's brilliant chemistry and performances, and also driven by masterful direction from Joel and Ethan Coen.",

Yet, the screenplay also makes use of some quirky sense of humour that makes it delightful while it is also able to distinguish itself among the numerous other films dealing with the theme of the writer's block.

The script is clever, and the plot is very simple, so what is required to make it work is good direction, a creative film style and a talented cast.\n\nBarton Fink is bereft of none of these things, and proves to be an Academy Award nominated artistic breakthrough for The Coen Brothers.\nWritten over the timespan of 3 weeks, Barton Fink features an insightful script which delves into the depth of characters faced with writers block, shame and the simple disrespect of being a human being. It conveys these messages by taking its basic plot and fulling it with in depth dynamics from a meaningful script which gives plenty of character insight and depth to the figures on screen, and it makes Barton Fink an excellent display of the human mind. \nAnd full of the stylistic direction that The Coen Brothers always manage to supply, Barton Fink is a simple artistic piece which benefits from their skills as filmmakers.\nAnd bravado performances keep it alive.\nAs an embodiment of the writers block the directors were faced with whilst writing Miller's Crossing, John Tuturro gives an excellent lead performance as a deep and meaningful writer faced in a challenging world full of fears. He constantly has a facial expression that makes it look like he is in serious thought and developing a great idea for his script, yet balancing it with a sense of uncertainty. His embodiment of The Coen Brothers themselves is a powerful performance, one of his career's best.\nBut John Goodman completely steals the screen in Barton Fink. His portrayal of a psychologically tormented everyman pushed over the edge by society is so organic and ripe with John Goodman's talent for aggression and deep meaning in line delivery. His passion as an actor is on full display in Barton Fink, and it's wonderful to behold as some of his finest effort.\nMichael Lerner was also good although needing more screen time, and John Mahoney supplied a genial presence and strong performance\nSteve Buscemi was also good, and Jon Polito was talented as always.\n\nSo Barton Fink proves to be a well constructed and cleverly written piece which shows off the fact that even in the difficult situation of writers block, The Coen Brothers can craft an excellent film.",

Each of their films are unique in their own way and this is very much the case with this impressive movie. A talented Playwright goes to Hollywood to start work on his first screenplay, and he discovers that Hollywood is much harder than what he thought it was going to be. The portrayal of Barton Fink is immaculate in the hands of actor John Torturro, who has done some impressive work with the Coens since. With this film, he really displays the talent that he uses to great advantage, and you are simply captivated by his performance.  This is a superb drama film that is among their best piece of work. With a brilliant cast at their disposal, and a well written script, Barton Fink is a must watch for viewers that enjoy a compelling dramatic work. Barton Fink isn't a perfect film, but nonetheless it is a fine example of why the Coen Brothers are terrific filmmakers who can tell an engaging story. Barton Fink is a well crafted picture that showcases great talent on-screen and it is a film that stands out among the Coen Brothers strongest efforts. That is a strong statement, because each of their efforts are well executed, well thought out storylines and effective performances that really make their work stand out among other directors. I really enjoyed the film, and thought that the cast and story were quite wonderful, and it could have been better in some areas, but overall this is yet another solid piece of cinema from two directors who know how to spin a terrific yarn.",

There are so many interesting things to say about this film.

To start, in O'Connor's work there must be always a intellectual, self righteous person that possesses enormous amounts of prejudice (Barton). This pompous character comes into contact someway with another character (Goodman) who appears to be more simple than our MC (main character). The MC mistreats this other character. The MC then discovers the truth about this other character, and is shocked to find out how wrong they were. In doing this, Character #2 offers redemption to the MC. This was most clearly shown in \"Good Country People\" and most famously \"A Good Man is Hard to Find.\" Also, as previously pointed out the girl on the beach was influenced by \"The Enduring Chill.\"",

While writers in the story like Fink and Mayhew claims themselves to be artists and understanding of the struggles and glories of the everyday people, it is satisfying to watch how little they actually understand these concepts. With the paper thin walls of the hotel, it is perhaps not surprising for characters like Charlie to be enraged by their feigned sincerity, and for their abrupt and forced intrusion into their lives. Ultimately it is not this understanding that sells in the box office, but a much simpler method that could be achieved only by everyday people. What Barton Fink experienced was not a writer's block, but the inability to construct a simple story which his complex mind could not conjure. A beautiful premise behind a gorgeous film, but the film overall is really hard to fully apprehend as I am still left puzzled by several motifs and symbols.",

Nun gut, ich mag Filme Ã¼ber Schreiber und zur Abwechslung hat mich die AbsurditÃ¤t der Coens kaum gestÃ¶rt.\n\nJohn Turturro ist Barton Fink. Barton ist ein erfolgreicher StÃ¼ckeschreiber am Broadway der 30er Jahre, der nun einem Angebot eines Filmstudios nach Hollywood folgt, und dort erst einmal von einer Schreibblockade befallen wird.\nDarÃ¼berhinaus scheint sein Hotelzimmer verrÃ¼ckt zu spielen, und sein Nachbar Charlie lenkt ihn ebenfalls ab.\nBarton ist damit beauftragt worden ein Ringer-B-Movie fÃ¼r Wallace Beery zu verfassen obwohl er sich so gar nicht mit Ringen auskennt. In seiner Verzweiflung kapselt er sich immer mehr ab, anstatt in die Welt hinauszugehen und echte Erfahrungen zu sammeln - oder bloÃŸ den Geschichten Charlies zur Inspiration zu lauschen. Er versucht eine Geschichte zu erdichten und ignoriert die bizarren und inspirierenden Vorkommnisse um ihn herum.\n\nNatÃ¼rlich darf auch ein MassenmÃ¶rder und eine brutale SchieÃŸerei nicht fehlen, wobei die GebrÃ¼der dieses Mal tatsÃ¤chlich eine passende Allegorie zwischen der HÃ¶lle der Schreibblockade und den endlosen GÃ¤ngen des Hotels die schlieÃŸlich in Flammen aufgehen schaffen.\n\nDie endlosen Weiten des Hotels lassen an Kubricks The Shining\" erinnern. Ein Film der Barton Fink\" auch thematisch zu inspirieren scheint. Ã„hnlich groÃŸartig wie bei Kubricks Meisterwerk arbeiten die Coens mit der Kamera und schaffen so eine AtmosphÃ¤re der Endlosigkeit und Einsamkeit zugleich.\n\nJohn Turturro, langjÃ¤hriger Wegbegleiter der Coens, ebenso wie Co-Star John Goodman, geben beide starke Performances, das Salz in der Suppe sind aber die kleineren Parts wie Tony Shalhoub als Produzent von Bartons Film und Michael Lerner als Studioboss (eine Rolle die ihm immerhin eine Oscar-Nominierung brachte).\n\nDie Kritik am Studiosystem ist nicht neu, und fÃ¼r die Coen Brothers war der Film eine Ãœbung zur Ãœberwindung ihrer eigenen Schreibblockade wÃ¤hrend sie an Miller's Crossing\" gearbeitet hatten. Das Ende ist mir persÃ¶nlich etwas zu surreal, aber von den Coens darf man ohnehin keinen gewÃ¶hnlichen Film erwarten. AuÃŸerdem fehlte mir etwas der 30er spezifische Charme in der Ausstattung und den KostÃ¼men.\n\nAber wie auch immer, man muss froh sein, dass einem auch seine Nemesis-Regisseure Hin und Wieder einen guten Film prÃ¤sentieren.",

            "content": "Ambiguous, thought-provoking, and bizarre as only the Coens could make it to be, Barton Fink is a journey through the mind and the study of a  troubled soul whose creative ideas are wasted on an industry concerned only with power and public appeal. John Turturro plays the title character, a New York play-write who is invited to Hollywood to write for the movies while he is enjoying the success of his play. He takes the offer and checks in to a large, daunting hotel where he meets Charlie (John Goodman), an insurance salesman with whom Barton shares his ideas of the \"common man.\" As soon as Barton settles down to write his first movie script, he becomes burdened with writer's block. The wrestling picture he is told to write for is all too simple and undeniably a B-movie, thus Barton is unable to find the words. Throughout the movie are capable, decisive characters who have the jobs they do simply because they know how to handle them well, like the film studio executive, who mostly decides who stays in the industry and who goes. The \"technicalities\" are irrelevant. Charlie is introduced as a warm and considerate man who visits Barton often to help him with writing and to tell him stories. he seems like a simple-minded man. But, as Barton learns by the end of the movie, he himself has no clearer an image of the \"common man\" than Charlie does. The actors do a fine job of playing the varied and odd characters of the movie, and the setting, which is is often a room with little decoration, gives a feeling of the dread of something very close and inescapable, which we learn is the mind itself. Due to the rather simplistic story but the vast and complex ideas one is left to ponder, the movie remains fascinating, both during and after viewing.",

And even if you don't enjoy the Coens' particularly brand of humor, the script is still top-notch without it.  At the same time this is a movie that is simply littered in detail.  It's a film that has been dissected throughout the years for what it alludes to, allegories, relationship to real life people, the way Hollywood worked back in the old days.  It's a film that's been dissected so many times that I'm not even going to bother going into it, because people have already done so and done so much better than I ever could.  I think the movie would still be enjoyable even if you didn't dig want to dig deeper.  But it is a movie that sort of sticks with you hours, even days, after you watch it.  I think the film is a mystery to be solved and that's part of the joy of watching it, at least to me.  Because the more you find out, the more unsettling the film is.  The Earle Hotel certainly has a very surreal quality to it and it certainly makes you question the reality of the events that take place there, because things start to get worse around the hotel with Barton's deteriorating mental state.  This deterioration is excellently showcased by John Turturro's performance, you can sense how he is truly losing his mind over this wrestling picture that should, as several people mention in the film, is just about following a simple formula.  A formula that Barton simply doesn't wish to follow as he wants to do something great.  I also enjoyed how the film looks at Hollywood and how Barton adjusts to this world that he despises and how he is simply disposable in their world.  As mentioned the film's performances are excellent.  I loved John Goodman's performance specifically because you never know what his motivations are.  He's a very likable guy when he needs to be, but you can tell that there was something off about him, but you can never truly figure him out and where's he coming from.  John Goodman did a fabulous job here.  John Turturro is also tremendous, the best thing he brings to the table is that he delivers his line with absolute conviction, it's like this character was an extension of his own personality.  As mentioned, John Turturro does a perfect job at displaying Barton's physical and mental collapse.  I almost hate to ignore the rest of the cast, but the cast is truly perfectly cast, not a weak link to be found.  The more I think about it the more I love this film, it's one of those type of films and in another reason why the Coens are as universally respected as they are.  I'd HIGHLY recommend this film, because it is just tremendous.",

Coen Brothers are not new to period dramas but they have pushed a notch higher in giving attention to detail here. While the consistency with their trademark quirky characters in Goodman and Lerner are omnipresent here, what rubbed me good and bad was the abrupt meta finish of this movie.\r\n\r\nSet in the 1930s, Barton Fink (John Turturro) is a budding stage writer who tasted his first success and gets immediately pulled by a Hollywood big shot Jack Lipnick (Michael Lerner). He is assigned to come up with an entertaining script about a wrestler while he is accommodated in a small time motel in Los Angeles. With the condition of his room deteriorating due to heat and a loud, intrusive neighbor Charlie Meadows (John Goodman), Barton hits a writer's block. With time running out, he befriends the secretary cum wife Audrey Taylor (Judy Davis) of a yesteryear's great writer W.P.Mayhew (John Mahoney). One day everything goes from bad to worse.\r\n\r\nFirst commendation goes for the excellent set pieces, art direction and attention to detail for the period. The script does occasionally have its pace breakers featuring John Mahoney's thread, otherwise it is quite entertaining. John Goodman gives a terrific performance as an intrusive neighbor who knocks the door at the wrong time and couldn't stop blabbering about the trivialities. But Michael Lerner steals the show with his breathless lines and impeccable comic timing leaving you wanting for more. \r\nI am unsure if I am impressed or disappointed by the abrupt closing credits though it looks beautiful, but I am sure surprised knowing other works from the Coen Brothers. There are quite a few theories floating around the internet justifying the climax, none comes even remotely close to convince me. The turn of events with John Goodman's character comes off as expected but is a little underwhelming. Though the atmosphere is perfectly set for a thriller, it does not reach the levels set by standard so high for a Coen Brother's film\r\n\r\nExcellent performances in a rather rare and slightly undercooked script.",

The early 40s retro mood of the film is evoked by the sweltering heat, varnished wood, and peeling wall paper of Barton's decaying hotel room while he attempts to create a screenplay from the detritus of his surroundings. While others have described the film in terms of surrealism or being pregnant with symbolism, which might well be the intention of the film's creators, such artistic embellishments do not raise the stories content much above an illustration of a disturbed dream sequence in which the actors move mechanically through their parts as if they themselves were rehearsing the screenplay aloud. You feel no sympathy for any of the victims much the same as if a cartoon character were being killed. Don't get me wrong, this film is an artistic creation but it's just too much of the same thing which turns into prolonged scenery. The trapped feeling that you get is as if you stood too long in front of an interesting painting at the museum.",

It's the story about the successful Jewish playwright Barton Fink (John Turturro) who after a successful play on Broadway have been offered a job in Hollywood, which he barely accepts. He then move to Los Angeles and stays at a hotel that is in bad shape, where the wallpaper is falling of. Nobody in the industry seems to care about him. The only one he can talk to is his next door neighbor, a  suicidal lawyer named Charlie Meadows (John Goodman) who actually is keeping back a big secret that might cost Barton's carrier and life, but I don't want to give away the movie.\n\nBarton Fink is a strange film, in some degree surreal, specially when it comes to John Goodman's, whom we really don't where to put. There's also the always weird and creepy Steve Buscemi as Chet, the skinny and pale receptionist who certainly never seen the day of light, they all give this movie  the kind of creepy and alienatiet feeling. There's also a lot of Hollywood stereotypes, such as the overweight upper class movie producer Jack Lipnick who is mostly based on Louis B. Mayer. And there's W.P. Mayhew an author who Barton looks up to, but when he finally meats him, he meets an alcoholic and violent man who have been repressed by the Hollywood system.\n\nI just love this film for it's alienated, and isolate state of mind from the rest of the world. It's a criticism toward Hollywood, as it was in the 40s and how it is today, because it certainly hasn't change. I will not give away the ending but I promise you it's worth waiting for, but I have to warn you, the film contains much symbolism, and there's some questions that don't are answered. Thumbs up.",

One night he calls a lady friend for help- and wakes up with her dead in his bed. From there, it getsÃ¢Â¦ surreal.\n\nA lot has already been written about the symbolism in this film. ItÃ¢(TM)s a lot to wrap our head around. Christ, the Wikipedia write up alone is 26 pages and 11,000 words. Gone With The Wind 16/7,000. And if the middle act wasn't so dull, I'm sure I would love this film more. It is rather flawlessly directed. Each shot seems so purposefully constructed; whereas in other Coen Bros movies, you might see more of a character domination. Not only that, no supporting actor is ever wasted. From the cops to the novelist to the insurance salesman; I was fascinated with each. But we spend too much time watching Barton climb the walls in terror of his writer's block.\n\nMaybe it's worth it to go through that in order to get to the payoff of what eventually becomes Fink's inspiration.

The hotel he is staying in acts as a sort of worm-hole between the reality of New York City and the fantasy of Hollywood (an obvious reference to David Lynch). The Coen Brothers's idea of Hollywood acts as both noirish an extremely Altman-esque. Robert Altman treated California as a surreal, dangerous, confusing, parallel universe and that is what the Coen's are doing here. Hollywood is transient, foreign and self referencing and so is \"Barton Fink.\" Like \"Blood Simple\" before it, \"Barton Fink\" is about movies.

Soon after Miller's Crossing was finished, the Coens began filming Barton Fink, which had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1991. In a rare sweep, Barton Fink won the Palme d'Or prize, as well as awards for Best Director and Best Actor (Turturro). The process of writing and the culture of entertainment production are two prominent themes of Barton Fink. The world of Hollywood is contrasted with that of Broadway, and the film analyzes superficial distinctions between high culture and low culture. Other themes in the film include fascism and World War II; slavery and conditions of labor in creative industries; and how intellectuals relate to \"the common man\". Because of its diverse elements, Barton Fink has defied efforts at genre classification. It has been variously referred to as a film noir, a horror film, a KÃ¼nstlerroman, and a 'buddy' film.\nThe surrealistic, abandoned mood of the Hotel Earle was central to the development of the story, and careful deliberation went into its design. There is a sharp contrast between Fink's living quarters and the polished, pristine environs of Hollywood, especially the home of Fink's boss Jack Lipnick. On the wall of Fink's room there hangs a single picture of a woman at the beach; this captures Barton's attention, and the image reappears in the final scene of the film. Although the picture and other elements of the film (including a mysterious box given to Fink by Charlie) appear laden with symbolism, critics disagree over their possible meanings. The Coens have acknowledged some intentional symbolic elements while denying an attempt to communicate some holistic message.\nThe film contains allusions to many real-life people and events, most notably the writers Clifford Odets and William Faulkner. The characters of Barton Fink and W.P. Mayhew are widely seen as fictional representations of these men, but the Coens stress important differences. They have also admitted to parodying film magnates like Louis B. Mayer, but they note that Fink's agonizing tribulations in Hollywood are not meant to reflect their own experiences.\nBarton Fink was influenced by several earlier works, including the films of Roman Polanski, particularly Repulsion (1965) and The Tenant (1976). Other movies that influenced Barton Fink are Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film The Shining and Sullivan's Travels (1941) by filmmaker Preston Sturges. The Coens' movie also contains a number of literary allusions, to works by William Shakespeare, John Keats and Flannery O'Connor. Several religious overtones also appear, including references to the Book of Daniel in the Old Testament, King Nebuchadnezzar and Bathsheba.Brilliant performances of Turturro and Goodman in a strange and surrealistic movie.Does everything really happened(like the neighbour and the murdered lover) or it's all in Barton's head?",

Now a few months ago I did a review marathon about the films of the Coen's, which was of course \"The Coen Brothers Review Week\" and out of all of the seven films I looked at one was the Coen's 1990 gangster film MILLER'S CROSSING. Upon looking into that films back story I learned that the Coen's during the middle of writing that films screenplay suffered from a bout of writers block. To most Artists of any calibre any form of creative block can be the most dreaded thing that can happen to them. Even the fertile minds of the then young Coen's became subject to the horrors of Writers block and it's with that block the brothers stopped writing   MILLER'S CROSSING and wrote the cult classic 1991 film BARTON FINK.\r\n\r\nAs one of the lesser known Cult titles in the Coen's flimography BARTON FINK this year celebrates its 20th anniversary and 20 years on it holds up as one of the Coen's most surreal, artistically bold and most haunting films from the Coen's. BARTON FINK blends together elements of Film-Noir, comedy, melodrama, social commentary, horror & surreal movies in one disturbing and unclassifiable package. Despite the problem to classify what genre of film this is, it's just simple to call this a Coen Brothers Film because it inhabits a world of its own. And in this surreal nightmare the Coen's made what can easily be called one of the Coen's greatest films that ranks alongside the likes of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN [2007], FARGO [1996], THE BIG LEBOWSKI [1998] & A SERIOUS MAN [2009]. So in the 12th review of my month long cult movie marathon the Coen's 1991 triple Palm D'Or winning masterpiece is today's Cult movie of choice.\r\n\r\nTHE PLOTLINE\r\n\r\nSet in the eventful year of 1941 in the later part of November and early December prior to the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbour. The story opens in New York City on Broadway were a young Left Wing Intellectual Playwright called Barton Fink (John Turturro) strikes the big time when his debut play is a critical success. After mingling with a bunch of New York Aristocrats in a fancy restaurant (which is what Barton despises), Barton's agent meets him in the Restaurant's Bar with some big news. The Agent informs Barton he has just landed him a deal with Hollywood Studio Capitol Pictures to write for them. Barton at first hates the Idea and despises what Hollywood stands for and would rather stay in NYC and create \"the theatre of Common Man\" (even though Hollywood bet him to the punch), no sooner dose the agent mentions how much Barton could be paid , Barton's views are muted out and he heads for Hollywood.\r\n\r\nIn Los Angeles, Barton checks into the eerie, vast, and empty Hotel Earle which in the lobby only seems to be inhabited by the Bell Boy Chet (Steve Buscemi) & the Elevator Operator. After settling into his room Barton meets with the head of Capitol Pictures Jack Lipnick (Michael Lerner) and his assistant. Lipnick a fast-talking movie mogul in the meeting with Barton talks to him about writing a B-Wrestling Picture for the studio (while totally mute Barton hardly says a word) and an outline is expected by the end of the week. Barton upon returning to  the Hotel Earle starts to write the screenplay but after barley one complete paragraph is beset by the sudden bout of writers block and finds himself distracted  by ever since minor sight or sound in the empty and quite hotel. Barton hears a faint sobbing coming from the next room and rings the front desk to complain. Moments later Barton hears a knock at the door which turns out to be his Neighbour Charlie Meadows (John Goodman) who invites himself into the room for a drink with Barton. During the chat with Charlie, Barton barley lets Charlie get a word in as soon as the fact Barton mentions he is a writer come up in the conversation. After Charlie leaves Barton's writers block increases which starts to evoke a sense of panic from Barton.\r\n\r\nUpon talking to the Producer of the Picture who is not happy to be involved with the project tells Barton if he is having trouble with the story, talking to another writer is the best bet.  After meeting celebrated Novelist W.P Mayhew (John Mahoney) in a Restaurant's lavatory and asks about how to write wrestling pictures, W.P offers Barton to visit him at his Bungalow. Barton soon encounters the ugly truth about a person he idolises. W.P has become an alcoholic and is abusive towards his partner Audrey (Judy Davis). Barton starts to become emotionally involved with Audrey when he realises the deadline is fast approaching and seeks her help. After passing out next to her during sexual intercourse, Barton wakes up next to a dead Audrey.  With a possible murder on his hands, the true identity of his Buddy Charlie is reviled to him after a visit by the L.A.P.D and with the impending deadline while still suffering from writer's block, Barton's world starts to be consumed by a total surreal nightmare.\r\n\r\nTHE ACTING, SCRIPTING, DIRECTION, SOUND & CINEMA-PHOTOGRAPHY\r\n \r\nTo start with John Turturro was simply amazing as the ill-suffering Left Wing, Jewish Intellectual Playwright. Turturro won a Palm D'Or for the role and it's without a doubt one moving performance. With the performance by John Goodman oh my god was it amazing; Goodman has in some respect been in other non-Coen films typecast as a likable character actor. Here in this film the Coen's at first use that typical Goodman image to make the character of Charlie as a Likable person to offset the contradictory Fink in the first half of the film. When the pity of the suffering for Barton increases it comes as a shock to see Goodman's character is really (SPOLIERS) a stark raving madman called Munt in the closing 10 minutes of the film. Goodman is just terrifying in this role especially when he wants to show 'The True Nature of the Mind\". The rest of the cast are brilliant in their roles thanks to either the well written and brilliant supporting characters by the Coen's or just due to their performances.\r\n\r\n The Coen's created a truly fascinating story after the narrative to MILLER'S CROSSING caused a bout of writers block for the brothers. BARTON FINK loosely blends the Coen's comedic style with nods towards to films like Roman Polanski's REPULSION [1965], Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINNING [1980] & Preston Sturges 1941 comedy classic SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS. With the Coen's quirky style it's safe to call the brothers as auteur filmmakers and BARTON FINK is one of the best films to come from the minds of the brothers. Combine with every sound being amplified to terrifying levels and each shot of the Hotel Earle reflecting a weird hybrid cross between the visual style of Film-Noir movies of the 1940's (which is appropriate  in this films case) and the empty shots of the Overlook Hotel in Kubrick's THE SHINNING. BARTON FINK is a truly great film that deserves a definite 90% from me, it's just that good.",

The entire cast is brilliant with Turturro reminding everybody what he was capable of back then, rather than being reduced to the Transformers series of films today.His character's arrogance, pretentiousness and stout stubbornness prove to be his downfall amongst a crazy neighbour; played with a chilling quietness by John Goodman, a drunken peer and a studio mogul from hell.\n\nThe paranoid tale is great, although at times it overreaches itself with it's ambition. Certain scenes don't sit well it jumps into the unbelievable or over the top. The real gem is the attack on the writing industry which is played out brilliantly in the conflict between Turturro, Polito and Oscar nominated Michael Lerner. \n\nWhat else do you expect from real masters of their craft? f you like the Coen or John Turturro then see this film.",

After all, it is the plot synopsis of the whole movie. But underneath its clever facade is a deeper message, a darker message. And if you pay attention to all of the minute details, you might understand what Joel and Ethan are hinting at.\n\nBarton Fink is wonderful, but only for a certain audience. There are those who will be bored and unimpressed by the atmosphere and the subtle manner in which the story and its messages are presented. This is not their kind of film.\n\nThis is our kind of film, fellow movie-lover. Enjoy it while it lasts.",

It surely takes you by surprise - I will give it that. The production design is another highlight. The peeling wallpapers. The dark rooms. The typewriter. The old time elevator. The rundown hotel has the perfect atmosphere for this story. I can't imagine Barton writing his movie script anywhere else! The film itself is open to interpretation. Was it all in his head? You can look at the film in many ways but it surely deals with the block of creativity. When a writer or artist can't figure out how to get create his next masterwork. The film delves into the pressures and stress that come with it. Barton's main problem seems to be his inability to connect with his fellow human being. He's supposed to be writing a script about a wrestler but he knows nothing about wrestling. He can't understand another's pain or suffering. He is literally locked away from the world mentally and physically. I think the film throws us into his state of mind. All the madness and absurdity. Everything just comes together in the most nightmarish and surreal way. Its happening but it almost doesn't seem real. Like at any minute - Barton is going to wake up and we can take a sigh of relief. So, while I found the transition of the film from a quirky satire to a surreal psychodrama a little jarring - I felt like its exactly where the film should have gone. Overall, BARTON FINK is one of the most fascinating films of the 90's. View it atleast once.",

The hotel he is staying in acts as a sort of worm-hole between the reality of New York City and the fantasy of Hollywood (an obvious reference to David Lynch). The Coen Brothers's idea of Hollywood acts as both noirish an extremely Altman-esque. Robert Altman treated California as a surreal, dangerous, confusing, parallel universe and that is what the Coen's are doing here. Hollywood is transient, foreign and self referencing and so is \"Barton Fink.\" Like \"Blood Simple\" before it, \"Barton Fink\" is about movies. The Coen Brothers's, among other things, are commenting on the sate of cinema during the time of the films release by combining preexisting cinematic troupes to create something that does not warrant categorization, only an analysis that folds back in onto itself.",

The second half is laced with enough of the surreal that you're forced to wonder if the whole movie is one long dream sequence. It's not. The Coen's are experimenting. Don't get hung up on the surreal scenes at the end. Movies aren't real and the Coen's made a film that throws these rules out the window. Here is my take:\n\nThe audience is introduced to Fink just as he begins to gain accolades for his \"common man\" play. Immediately, Hollywood execs court him to come out west. Against his better judgment, he agrees and sell his soul to Hollywood. Fink arrives to California and checks into Hotel Earle (or Hotel California) the place that will represent the mind of Charlie, a neighbor Fink befriends. Charlie personifies the average man that Barton Fink endears. Yet, Fink's own self-importance acts as a barrier between him and those he aspires to write for. Fink becomes trapped in a state of writers block, finding no inspiration for the subject of his new wrestling themed writing assignment. When the one woman who can help him with his writing dilemma ends up dead in his own bed, all hope is lost. That is until Charlie saves the day by removing the woman's body and later giving Barton a human head sized package to take care of while he's away on business. Soon, Barton Fink is writing again, the mysterious package conveniently at his typewriter's side. The script is his masterpiece. Unfortunately the studio doesn't agree and wont shoot it or any of his future stories. Barton Fink's thoughts are the property of Capital Pictures, and he becomes condemned as a writer no longer able to create anything meaningful. He is in his own private writer's hell.",

The hotel is the most meticulously riddled with details; as Barton's base of operations for most of the movie, the great amount of time spent there greatly lends itself to interpretation and analysis.  The film is a descent into the kookiness of the artist's mind, delving further and further into surrealism and leaving us wondering just how much of the film actually transpired in the way it is shown to us.  The narrative arc modifies and backhandedly pays tribute to the many storied personalities of 1940s Hollywood, which ultimately attests to the power of the author to shape and modify a story using previously utilized narrative conventions, characters and events.   At some point in the movie, the fabula and sjuzet reach a crossroads and take off in separate directions which only further baffles and intrigues us as we wait to see what additional facet of narrative Hell (typically in the guise of the ironic coincidence) is unleashed on unwitting Barton.  The many complexities, playful transmogrification of various plot and historical elements make this film the Coen Brothers' most postmodern movie; that's saying something based on their track record of twisting generic conventions.  The actors all do a bang-up job staying true to their characters and embracing the lunacy around them.

That's also a good description for this film. Fun, because it is laced with the black comedy that Coen Brothers aficionados are accustomed. Intrigue and mystery, because the filmmakers needed to do something to spice up the narrative, which isn't all that exciting when imagined by itself. What percentage of the mainstream do you think would have rushed out to see a film that was ostensibly about a writer, alone in his room, trying to overcome writer's block? We must enjoy being romanced by the mystery and intrigue because if we are looking for explanations and explicit meaning, we won't find it. And the Coens rarely hint at what they have in mind. They just manufacture these stylish films that provide fodder for discussion long after the house lights come up.",

Particularly because the due themselves are essentially writers themselves and though they have a magnificent hold on other aspects of Cinema as well, it's their writing that always stands out with characters they create and dialogues given to them. \n\nAnd it's a masterful character, Barton Fink, created with utmost passion.He talks passionately about common man & the beauty of the simple truths but as someone wise said \"Truth is rarely simple & never pure\", he dismisses everything connected to common man or let's say never cares to learn about them. In fact his inspiration comes from something as abstract as a painting. At first sight, it seems like intellectual arrogance but as you go on you realize it's more than that. It's about your mind creating an identity of it's own and while you may want to project some idealistic vision, it has it's own fascinations. That's where Barton Fink is very similar to Polanski's \"The Tenant\". The concept of detachment of mind as a separate entity itself is what both movies seem to work on.\n\nThere are events & characters as well that just seem to be the manifestations of Fink's own mind. W.P. Mayhew played by John Mahoney seems to be a futuristic version of Fink himself who has accepted the domination of mind over ideals and same goes with two detectives who bring with them the characteristic humor of Coen Brother films. John Turturro is brilliant only to be outdone by absolutely magnificent John Goodman.\n\nBarton Fink is not a movie than can be fully appreciated in one viewing and one may find different details with repeat viewing which may even be contradictory and why not?...After all what is mind for but to induce contradictions!....",

There's commentary on how movies attacked the popularity of the theater but there's also a suggestion that playwrights arrogantly view themselves as being better than screen writers. The ultimate message from the Coen brothers for me is that movies, as bad as they can be, can produce art as good as anything we see in other forms. Where is this ultimate message you ask? Why, the movie itself of course. This has great performances from everyone on screen. Judy Davis in particular is mesmerizing. Her character is a wonderful parody of an old Hollywood actress and Goodman and Turturro are as good as I've ever seen them in anything else. Its visually beautiful and expertly constructed. Its a movie that will remain in your memory for good. So much can be read from the final scene that you could hold a conference or write a thesis. For me the box contains Finks creativity.

The performances in this film are some of my favourites, Turturro as the brainy idealistic writer who drives himself up the wall with writers block, not helped by Lynchian hotel he chooses and a \"noisy\" common man neighbour, played with creepy sweaty charm by Goodman. The writing is also sharp, and the film feels like a very personal work, indeed it was conceived by the brothers to let off some steam when writing on Miller's Crossing slowed to a halt. It feels like there could be a lot of brainy metaphors going on by the end, with head-sized boxes, hellfire and paintings coming true but I think that would just be too Barton Fink in itself.

            "content": "And so, Joel and Ethan Coen take on their most harrowing challenge yet: ...putting John Turturro in a lead role. I'm kidding, John Turturro is awesome, apparently as more than just a character actor, but I'm not entirely kidding when I say that we are dealing with a harrowing endeavor with this, \"The Fly III: The Rise of the Mosquito\"! I can't help but think a surrealist horror film of that nature when I see this film's poster, because the titular Barton Fink seems to be really freaked out by that mosquito, and looks so much like some kind of a combination between Jeff Goldbum as Seth Brundle, and Eraserhead, and... Woody Allen. I guess all New York Jew screenwriters look alike, and yes, I'm very, very well aware that Turturro is Italian, and therefore Catholic, but then again, New York Italians don't look that much different from New York Jews. Hey, he must have had the Coen brothers fooled, because Fink is by no means an Italian name, although it is pretty popular with - you guessed it - the Jews. Boy, when the Coens said that they \"didn't do any research, actually, at all\" for this film, they weren't kidding, yet here they are, deconstructing Broadway and Hollywood, just as they deconstructed Texas in \"Blood Simple\", and Arizona in \"Raising Arizona\"... probably because they even realize that their films are bland enough when they're not set in their hometown of Minnesota. Well, make no mistake, this film, as the Coens' first rewarding drama, by one heck of a long-shot, is a whole lot more exciting than Minnesota, to a certain extent, at least.\r\n\r\nSomething that I really appreciate about this film is its extensiveness as a character study, even in concept, and yet, I don't know if a narrative this intimate is layered enough to warrant a runtime of nearly two hours, dragged towards with overdrawn meditations on certain material and filler that all but stiffen pace, while leaving what layers there are to this drama to outstay their welcome. The film is driven by the titular Barton Fink's interactions with eccentric peers, and the more time it spends with one peer is time lost on another, thus, when focus shifts, it jars, resulting in some glaring focal inconsistencies that are almost, maybe even about as detrimental to a smooth sense of momentum as tonal inconsistencies. Now, there are more inconsistencies in focus than in tone, because it's not until more consequential conflicts come into play, a little past the hour mark, when tone takes a serious shift, but make no bones about it, when the humor chills down a bit for the sake of tension, the twist, no matter how gripping, is a touch too sharp, shaking dramatic momentum a bit, or at least reflecting an ambition for dramatic momentum. Although they had never been so inspired by this point, Joel and Ethan Coen, with this film, had not yet fully cleansed an almost awkward sense of ambition, and there are times in which they get too carried away with such ambition to get a comfortable grip on structure, which isn't to say that the generally tightly fulfilled ambition is the most relatively distancing aspect of this drama. The Coens' trademark directorial thoughtfulness, being backed by particularly intriguing subject matter, a particularly razor-sharp script, and particularly well-portrayed characters, is particularly effective, but considering the steadiness of this narrative, material lapses often, and when it does, I'm not going to lie, the film occasionally falls into dullness, and when it doesn't do that, it at least descends to a certain bland coldness which shakes the bite of the film's subjective value. Of course, it's not only the cold spells that shake substance, as it seems as though the drama tries a little too hard at times with its wit and subtle style, and when you combine these reflections of ambition with such reflections as hiccups in a movement to meet ambition with inspiration, the final product finds itself held back, but only shy of excellent. I don't know how far this somewhat minimalist film could have gone, but through the flaws of a project of only so much consequence are the strengths of an outstanding effort, the glimpses of which are plentiful enough to make a strong picture whose inspiration even touches art direction.\r\n\r\nExploring the high cultures of New York and Hollywood, in addition to some of the grime of the Los Angeles low culture, during 1941, this period piece has a potential for diversity to its settings that Robert C. Goldstein and Leslie McDonald go above and beyond with when it comes to fulfilling through art direction that distinguishes each set and costume with an immersive handsomeness that is augmented by the Coen brothers' first of many collaborations with the great Roger Deakins. Deakins' cinematography might not be stunning, but it is consistently sharp with its subtle lighting and coloration, with a visual style that is made all the more immersive by impeccable framing and sweeping camerawork, and defines the final product as, if nothing else, stylistically upstanding, which isn't to say that style solely defines the drama. While the story concept doesn't match the sharpness of its interpretation enough to craft an altogether excellent effort, this film's subject matter is not simply intriguing, but genuinely original, in its approach to intriguing themes on the artistic distinctions between stage and film, and the social and intellectual distinctions and pain between big-shots and simple men, while studying on the personal conflicts of a man in strange land that grow heavier and heavier as the land grows stranger and stranger, thus making for an interesting film idea that is done justice by plenty, but only truly brought to life by the Coen brothers' writers. As with any of the Coens' best films, this effort thrives on its being so incredibly well-written, and even if the interpretation of the script is not of equal quality, there's no seeing this film as good as it is without the biting satire that is distinctly colorful, yet not too over-the-top, thanks to a cleverness that is anchored by sparklingly snappy dialogue that needs to be heard in order to be believed, and helps in tightly defining colorful characters who are still best-defined by their portrayals. One might expect a drama this minimal to seriously limit acting material, but most everyone has his or her time to shine, whether it be the delightfully over-the-top Michael Lerner and John Mahoney as flawed Hollywood sensations, or the effective Judy Davis as a woman in love with a troubled artist, or the show-stealing John Goodman, whose chillingly intense dramatic twists break which reflect a certain instability to the Charlie Meadows character punctuate Goodman's classic charm at its most dynamite, especially when applied to equally dynamite chemistry with leading man John Turturro, who is the real treat of this picture, with a subdued charisma that makes the titular Barton Fink character effective as an avatar audience who is distinguished by his own right by remarkable layering that never lose passion, but gradually mold Fink as a man of vision and fear, both for his art and his life. As much as everyone justly praises Goodman, Turturro is a revelation, and if you see the film for no other reason, see it for him, but stay for the Coens' performance as directors, who admittedly make sticking around a bit of a challenge with their pacing issues, overstylization and overambition, but whose more subtle stylistic touches go a long way in coloring up the film, and whose more thoughtful touches are often given enough to work with to bite, whether it be with dramatic intrigue or tension that compel, often thoroughly. In a lot of ways, the film is so good, even excellent, and it's frustrating that natural and consequential shortcomings are recurring enough to hold the final product back from excellence, yet inspiration is never lost, entertaining and intriguing enough to make a strong drama.\r\n\r\nWhen the job is done, some questionable structuring that drags and finds inconsistencies in focus and tone, joined by some dull, or at least coldly distancing dry spells in direction, betray a potential for excellence, but just barely, for there is enough inspiration to immersive art direction which captures the era impeccably, handsome cinematography which captures style dynamically, and original and intriguing subject matter which is brought to life by sparklingly clever writing, great acting - especially by show-stealer John Goodman and revelatory leading man John Turturro - and effective direction to make \"Barton Fink\" a generally biting satire, intriguing drama and overall engrossing first triumph for Joel and Ethan Coen.\r\n\r\n3.25/5 - Strong",

Arrivato a Los Angeles Barton prende una camera all'hotel Earl, un buio e polveroso albergo i cui unici \"abitanti\" visibili sono il concierge Chet, l'anziano addetto all'ascensore e Charlie Meadows, un bonario agente assicurativo e vicino di stanza di Barton, che subito instaura un buon rapporto con Fink. Barton, messosi al lavoro nella sua stanza con due finestre vista muro, tappezzeria scollata e un piccolo quadro con una ragazza che guarda una spiaggia, incappa nel \"blocco dello scrittore\" e per risolverlo si rivolge al romanziere/sceneggiatore J.P. Mayhew e alla sua segretaria/amante Audrey, colei che da tempo si occupa di scrivere le sceneggiature di Mayhew ormai alcolizzato e incapace di produrre. Al risveglio dopo una notte d'amore Barton trova al suo fianco il cadavere di Audrey e le sue urla richiamano il vicino Charlie che decide di aiutare Barton preoccupandosi di occultare il cadavere.\n\nCharlie poi parte per New York lasciando a Barton un pacco e promettendo di fare visita ai suoi genitori, ma poco dopo all'hotel giungono due poliziotti che spiegano a Barton che Charlie in realtÃ  Ã¨ un pericoloso serial killer. Travolto dalla realtÃ  Barton ritrova l'ispirazione e scrive rapidamente un soggetto, che perÃ² viene rifiutato dal produttore. Tornato all'albergo Barton ritrova i due poliziotti che vogliono arrestarlo ma in quel momento scoppia un incendio e ritorna Charlie che uccide i due poliziotti e, mentre Barton fugge, rimane nell'hotel in fiamme. Barton si ritrova sulla spiaggia, dove incontra una ragazza, del tutto uguale a quella raffigurata nel quadro della sua stanza.\n[it.wikipedia.org]",

Like many of their movies don't expect to get a nice, clean, cookie-cutter, Hollywood ending, but the ending will really make you think much more than the regular stuff Hollywood spits out. What I liked was that many surprises happen in Barton Fink, that leave you guessing, suspending you on the edge of your seat, wondering how it's all gonna turn out in the end. Of course like all Coen-made movies, it has that subtle humor in it but I'd say this is a lot more drama and film noir than it is a comedy. Not like Lebowski or O Brother.

So he he tries too hard and write what he calls his best work. The whole movie is filled with metaphors and things that would show up later in the movie. One of my favorite is the picture. In Barton's hotel room where he resides, there is a photo of a woman sitting on a beach that inspires him to write. In the end of the movie he experiences that photo. There is a whole story that is really complicated and can't even explain. If I hadn't seen tis movie, then I wouldn't think so highly of John Turturro (Mainly because of Transformers). He does such a good job in this movie. Who else could play Barton Fink, he looks like a Barton. John Goodman does well also. I think John Turturro should have been nominated or won an Oscar for his performance. I mean Anthony Hopkins won for The Silence of the Lambs. Where he only appears in the movie for like 2 and a half minutes.The Coen brothers should have won Best Original Scrrenplay.

I just don't care enough. John Goodman is superb as Charlie Meadows and easily steals every scene he is in and while John Turturro is fine as Fink, for me, he just doesn't convince as he slides into madness as his life begins to unravel. The performance just seems to lack the mania it needs and comes over as a rather pale Woody Allen pastische. Darkly comic in places, a plot with a lot of promise and a rather unsatisfying ending.",

            "content": "A gnarled Faustian riddle of a film with an astonishing wealth of subtext. Barton Fink is an absolutely fantastic character, host to some of the Coens' most insightful sociological observation, and John Turturro is 100% on board with the person they're trying to create. I love the delicious narcissism he projects when he purports interest in the \"common man,\" but ultimately that interest is self-serving, a means to an end for his own intellectual fulfillment. When meeting a true paragon of the aesthetic he's trying to capture (John Goodman, who is excitingly awesome here), Fink is utterly unconcerned with his attempts to actually teach him or tell him stories of his life, gleaning only what he needs from their few conversations. It's a full-bodied, riveting characterization, and it's truly a shame that Turturro didn't pick up an Oscar nomination for his incisive work. (Michael Lerner getting a nomination for his one-volume-fits-all shoutfest, on the other hand, almost feels like a slap in the face.) \n\nThe rest of the movie, a visually arresting cautionary tale about reconciling the \"life of the mind\" with Hollywood's pernicious capitalism, is almost too cruel to put into words. Along with their typical emotional abuse of their characters, the Coens here subject Barton Fink to an immense amount of mental duress; the challenge in watching this movie is that Fink kvetches so much about every little thing that goes wrong for him that it's difficult to truly empathize with him. Sure, we understand that he's not a very good person and there's really no incentive for getting behind him, but it's that perspective that makes the movie's view of haughty intellectualism that much more cogent. Plus, the last half hour of the movie is a complete mindfuck, if you're into that sort of thing (which I definitely am). It's sometimes a tricky balance depicting a character's dissolving mental state on film and keeping it representational versus presentational, but what we see in Barton Fink is assumed to be no less than the truth, and the Coens play it totally seriously, in their darkly humorous way. They've never really warped reality in any of their films as they have here - some of their characters may act completely beyond human comprehension, sure, but here we're invited along for a ride through Barton Fink's personal hell. And it is great.",

Miller's Crossing contained a depth of plot that knows few equals in Hollywood, particularly as far as gangster films are concerned. \n\nSo how do you treat a particularly bad case of block? By writing a film about writer's block where all of the worst possible things happen to a writer. This writer (John Turturro) just wrote a play that makes him the toast of New York, so he takes a contract in Hollywood writing films to help fund his true passionate subjects later. And then he gets stuck writing a B wrestling picture, when wrestling is the last thing he knows anything about. Even though he claims to write for the \"common man\", all of his speechifying and his complicated thoughts show how isolated he is. And boy does he pay the price!\n\n*Spoilers*\nEverybody he knows dies and his helpful neighbor, a wonderful John Goodman, turns into the personified wrath of the common man, a demonic figure followed by fire who shows Fink where he really went wrong. And on top of all that, the studio HATES his pretentious script and keeps him under contract while publishing nothing, effectively burying him and ending his career.\n\nIt reminds me of David Lynch's Eraserhead, written out of fear of becoming a father it takes the absolute worst thing that could happen to a new dad and projects it on screen. Barton Fink is the same way. What's the worst that could happen if Joel and Ethan can't finish the script? Well, everybody they know could die and their careers could be ruined forever. Cool!",

D'abord, il y a une formidable faÃƒÂ§on de dÃƒÂ©peindre le monde hollywoodien, des producteurs, de l'hypocrisie qui rÃƒÂ¨gne et de celui des scÃƒÂ©naristes (ÃƒÂ©crivains). Dans ce dernier cas, il ne sont pas forcÃƒÂ©ment portÃƒÂ©s aux nues. Bien au contraire, le problÃƒÂ¨me de Barton Fink est qu'il se prend peut-ÃƒÂªtre pour quelque chose qu'il n'est pas. Il ÃƒÂ©crit pour le peuple, il pense comprendre l'essence mÃƒÂªme du peuple mais il n'ÃƒÂ©coute pas le peuple.

It's a black comedy that changes into something quite sinister near the end. All the main characters are eccentric nut jobs that could only feel at home in a Coen Brothers movie. It's something your either love or loath as they are so incredibly messed up. The cast are all superb, Goodman is outstanding,the man's a genius,it's hard not to like Charlie when you first meet him,he's so infectious,it makes it all the sweeter when you find out his real identity. Turturro is also perfect as Barton,this must be one of his best roles to date. The Hotel itself is a character,with it's wet walls and slimly wall paper. It would feel completely desolated and deserted of life,if it wasn't for the shoes. About the half way mark and the feeling of the movie changes dramatically. It starts to feel like a horror movie,the once wet walls of the hotel are now dripping with fire as Barton's sanity is pushed to it's limit. This is such a cleaver movie,this was written when the brothers had writers block whilst penning Millers Crossing. That alone blows my mind,that something this good was created that way.",

This one has a similar basic structure to their recent A Serious Man: it's about a nice but unexceptional man struggling vainly to deal with a series of baffling circumstances. This time it's John Turturro as Barton Fink, an earnest young liberal playwright in the 1930s who gets hired by Hollywood to write a B-movie. He believes his writing can help the proletarian \"common man,\" but is actually not all that interested in common men when he meets them. The supporting cast has some of the best character actors in the business: Steve Buscemi, Tony Shaloub, Judy Davis, and John Mahoney as a thinly disguised William Faulkner. Michael Lerner got an Oscar nomination for his hilarious supporting role as a blustery Hollywood producer who pretends to care about art but really is only concerned with the studio's bottom line. John Goodman also gets one of his best parts ever as Fink's suspiciously friendly neighbor. There are lots of great little touches, such as the multiple ways in which Fink's hotel is made to seem like Hell itself. There's the creepy sucking noise his door makes every time it is opened or closed, and the way the wallpaper keeps sweating and peeling. The movie goes along in a relatively conventional manner for a while before totally going off the rails and into crazy Coen territory in the last half-hour. The fact that this was only their fourth movie is impressive, and makes you wonder how these guys keep getting away with it.",

I've never felt as close to the character's struggle as when I tried to write a review for it.  But a few hours later, here it is.\r\n\r\nWhat's impressive about this labyrinth of a film and the Coen Brothers (as if they're not impressive enough) is that it was written in a matter of three weeks during a spout of writer's block while working on Miller's Crossing.  For such a quick scribble, Barton Fink has more layers than a pyramid scheme, steeped in social, political, and existential allegory.\r\n\r\nFink, played by John Turturro, is a New York playwright on the rise, chosen by a Hollywood studio to pen a wrestling B-movie.  He takes up residence in a run-down hotel where he tries to work out his mental difficulties, no thanks to the imposition of his loud, mysterious neighbor, Charlie Meadows (played by John Goodman).\r\n\r\nI could go on for days about the symbolisms displayed...The wallpaper peeling in the hotel room that represents Fink's mind, analogies offered by the very film Fink is working on, references to slavery as metaphors of the studio's ownership of Fink's creativity, along with other strong yet accurate accusations of the Hollywood machine (the studio head exclaims to Fink: \"This is a wrestling picture, the audience wants to see action, adventure, wrestling. They don't want to see a guy wrestling with his own soul!\") \r\n\r\nWhat I enjoyed about this film also were a couple moments where I thought to myself, \"is it okay to laugh here?\"  It's a think piece that defies the pigeonholing of genre placement, incorporating elements of noir, psycho-thriller, horror, and dark comedy.\r\n\r\nThere is a quick transition shot of the California coast toward the beginning of the film when Barton makes his move to Los Angeles that, for some reason - combined with a picture of that same beach hanging in Barton's hotel room - felt like a serene yet uneasy foreshadowing of a painful end.  A seemingly harmless 5-second glimpse of waves crashing into a large rock that I failed to shake throughout the film's duration.\r\n\r\nWith its many faces, Barton Fink opens itself up to varied impressions and analysis.  And with its complicated simplicity, this film offers a high replay value.  Discovering Coen gems I've missed, I feel a bit forced to tweak the order of my \"Favorite Directors\" list.",

I like it how it tells that good writers don't get into Hollywood but crap ones like Stephanie Meyer with the so-called-Twilight made it (it wasn't said like that in the movie but it's my opinion that I think Mira W., the Indonesian romance writer, even makes better story than she does). It is not romance, it is not action, but a very deep drama. Of course it won't make it to Hollywood, but it is a GREAT failure. I mean it's GREAT.",

            "content": "It's amusing to see something marvelous created out of the creation process for a more-concentrated piece of work that fell under the radar as a \"sleeper\" hit. The Coen Brothers drowned themselves in writers' block during the creative process of writing their mob piece 'Miller's Crossing', which in itself was a muse to make 'Barton Fink' happen a year later. 'Miller's Crossing', set in the 1930's Prohibition-era, was obvious more tedious in attention to detail, setting, camera work, lighting, costumes, and the consistency of creative mob-speak; 'Barton Fink', set only a decade later in the 1940's, was a much simpler route in production, as it was intent on limited setting mostly in a run-down hotel room, and far less characters, and far less of a puzzle of double-cross. Both films do, similarly, involve a noir-esque descent of the world on the protagonist of Atlas-proportions, but my opinion: 'Barton Fink' is the better film. It tells of our titular character - a 1940's idealistic playwright whose underground success of the stage leads to a financially-endowed opportunity to write for Hollywood producers. His Achilles' Heel is the fact that he was a Robert Bresson before Robert Bresson made films (nerd translation: Robert Bresson was a French pre-Nouvelle Vague film director whose prominent intent was to make films that strip away the sophistication and glamour of forced acting in order to document real life of the common man or woman in a fictional story - basically a study in realism). Barton's integrity is expected to wear thin once he enters Capital Films - a large production company who hires him to write a B-movie about wrestling. Hitting one brick wall after another, yet experiencing a chain of unusual and surreal events while exiled in his dark, crummy hotel room, Barton finds it increasingly difficult to sacrifice his literary integrity to come up with a wrestling story. In the meantime, he befriends his neighbor Charlie Meadows - played by an uproariously funny John Goodman. Charlie Meadows takes on the identity of what's considered the 'common man': a struggling insurance salesman living a moderate lifestyle. Also entering his life is W.P. Mayhew - played by a finely-acted John Maloney with a genuine Georgian tongue. W.P. Mayhew is almost like an idol to Barton's passion of entertainment writing, but soon finds out how much of a false life he's lived, by way of Mayhew owing his writing success to his secretary Audrey Taylor (played by a magnificent and seductive Judy Davis). By way of film noir, Audrey becomes something like a femme fatale and a passionate fantasy to Barton, and almost immediately, Barton's world spirals in hellish, downward descent. He begins to realize himself what it means to be a true \"outsider\" - an \"outsider\" to Hollywood as is incapable of sacrificing integrity for a piece of literary work, and an \"outsider\" to the \"common man\" he desires to portray in each story, since he isn't such the \"common man\" himself to fully relate to. In the end, he's just a \"tourist with a typewriter\". This one is actually the first film composed without the signature cinematography work of Barry Sonnenfield (their weapon of choice who almost single-handedly provided the Coen Brothers with their films' signature style and look with fast-acting character zoom-ins and wide-angle frame-scapes), but whoever replaced him behind the camera and lighting sure took note of the past films which shaped the Coens' career. The Coen Brothers have developed yet another perplexing artifice to destroy a protagonist - everything from 'Barton Fink', 'Miller's Crossing', 'The Big Lebowski', 'Burn After Reading' and even their most recent 'A Serious Man' - they all deal similar cards in giving one bold human being the ultimate run-around. This one ends with something of a brick wall, with plenty on the surreal side to ponder about. 'Barton Fink' is certainly one of the more sleeper successes of the Coens' career, and quite considerably one of their finest, most puzzlingly genius bodies of work - not to mention, perhaps their most passionately simplistic 116 minutes yet.",

            "content": "Movies with ambiguous endings stay with you forever. Think of the first time you saw Lost in Translation (what does he whisper in her ear!?) or pondering why the birds came in Hitchcock's The Birds, the briefcase in Pulp Fiction, Magnolia, Punch Drunk Love, Broken Flowers, Fight Club, No country for Old Men and even the Dark Knight all present endings and elements throughout that provide intense interpretations and lend themselves as prime subjects for Zoom-In analysis. However, one that presents itself as a highly metaphorical and highly ambiguous film is the Cohen Brother's 1991 film, Barton Fink. The first film to win all three major awards (Palme D'or, Best Director, and Best Actor) at the Cannes Film Festival. Also, it was unanimously chosen for the Palme D'or.\r\n\r\nThe entire film presents itself as a metaphor for heaven and hell. Barton Fink is played by John Tuturo (what ethnicity is this guy!? He plays everything) who is a critically acclaimed playwright who is hired to a contract in Hollywood to make the transition into film. He claims to write scripts for and about the \"everyday man.\" After being offered to bunk up in a Hollywood suite, he insistently declines in order to stay in an average hotel called the Hotel Earle. When Chet (Steve Buscemi, the hotel clerk) first appears he comes out of a door on the floor after it takes him a long while to reach the top, like if he was ascending from the underworld. - The word \"six\" is said three times in the elevator. - Hotel Earle can be an anagram of the words Hell and Erato, the Greek Muze of lyric poetry.\r\n\r\nCharlie (John Goodman) is Barton Fink's neighbor who Barton feels an attachment to. Most people concur that Charlie represents the devil. Instead, I think that Charlie represents the repressed rage that \"common men\" trapped in dead-end lives feel. The pealing wallpaper and heat represent the rage stewing just under the surface, the flames are when Charlie's pent-up anger and resentments finally explode to the surface. Barton struggles through writing his first film, with deadlines about a wrestler. He seeks aid in the help of a famous writer's wife (Audrey) who he ends up sleeping with and he wakes up to her dead (slashed, bloody) body next to him. He finds out that Charlie is a serial killer who chops off people's heads from the police who question Barton after finishing his script. The studio hates the script and Charlie arrives at home to his apartment lit on fire by Charlie who kills the police investigators that are waiting for him with a shotgun.\r\n\r\nThe Hotel beings to burn and the wallpaper (which has been ripping off throughout the movie continues to rip away). Charlie then says my favorite line in the movie, as the apartment is burning to the ground: \"If you need me, I'll be in my room.\" He then says he went to visit Barton's parents on the East coast where he is from and leaves Barton a gift in a box.\r\n\r\nBarton leaves the apartment and walks on the beach where he sits down in front of a beautiful women which resembles exactly the picture of a woman on the beach that has rested on his wall of the hotel room that he had gazed at for release throughout his time spent there. This brings us to the last lines of the film between the woman and Barton:\r\n\r\nBeauty: It's a beautiful day.\r\nBarton: Huh?\r\nBeauty: I said it's a beautiful day.\r\nBarton: Yes. It is.\r\nBeauty: What's in the box?\r\nBarton: I don't know.\r\nBeauty: Isn't it yours?\r\nBarton: I don't know. You're very beautiful. Are you in pictures?\r\nBeauty: Don't be silly.\r\n\r\nThe questions arise: what is in the box? what does the girl in the picture come to real life represent? and finally what does the wallpaper ripping off mean?\r\n\r\nHere are some explanations I have dug up:\r\n\r\nFirst of all this is like the briefcase in Pulp Fiction it is not meant to be known. I have always thought it was Barton's mind. He couldn't write before but once he got his mind back he was free to write away. Also at the end he finds out that Capital Pictures owns him and his mind so when the girl asks if that is his box he responds \"I don't know\" meaning he doesn't know if it belongs to him or to Capital Pictures.\r\n\r\nNow this of course isn't supposed to be taking literally I know his mind isn't actually in the box but it is symbolic of it.\r\n\r\nALSO:\r\n\r\nThe suggestion seems to be that's it's Audrey's head. Yet, there's a very \"Pulp Fiction\" aspect to it as well where we're not really meant to know. And yet, more than in \"Pulp Finction\"- where the mystery remains much more sublime than any attempt at explantion- we seem invited to seek out an interpretation here to find one that is more symbolic than literal. Barton's \"mind\" or \"the truth\" are good ones- \"mind\" could also be interpreted as Barton's creativity or even his soul (much like those slightly tedious interpretations of Marcellus's briefcase- I reckon it works better here.) The only real clues we have are the size of the box and Mudnt's confession that he lied and that it doesn't really belong to him (ie. does that mean it's Audrey's head or something belonging to Barton?)\r\n\r\nHowever, I think it's significant that Barton doesn't actually open the box- therefore doesn't actually release his mind/creatively/soul. The way I like to look at it is that it is that very mystery of not knowing what's in the box that finally releases his creativity (and so leaves the explanation unknown-like Pulp Fiction). The point that Barton also confesses that he doesn't know what's in the box- and therefore might mean that he doesn't know if he still owns his own creativity- is a good one, but it could work on this level too- ie. that he still doesn't know what's in the box and is- perhaps- still feeding of that mystery. Who knows? Do we really need to know? Sometimes unanswered questions are more inspirational than answered ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonally I thought that what was in the box was the head of his parents who he went to visit, meaning that when you go to hell, you bring everyone you know down with you. What did you think?\r\n\r\nRotten Tomatoes give this move a 91% rating\r\n\r\nZoom In Analysis will DISAGREE with this rating and give it a 7.5 out of 10\r\n\r\nAlthough there is a lot of ambiguity and the movie definitely pulls on the critics strings hitting all the right notes, it lacks audience appeal, but a great flick for those who love to interpret movies. If only judging it as a well written story with long lasting effect I would agree with RT, however when popping this movie into a wide appeal audience it won't be for everyone.",
