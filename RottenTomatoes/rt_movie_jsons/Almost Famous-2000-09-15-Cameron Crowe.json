However, the movie is not so much about the music as it is about adolescence and the pursuit of an adventure. The intention seems to be to demonstrate the importance of a push and pull between mentorship, orderly rules, and chaos in character development thereby providing a familiar but nonetheless interesting interpretation of what it means to grow up and become an \"interesting\" person. Very similar feeling to The Girls Next Door and Risky Business.",

The movie takes a look at a brighter than average American boy who comes of age in the era of the 60's and 70's.  Patrick Fugit is great as Crowe.   The cast, including Philip Seymour Hoffman, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, Frances McDormand and so many more is really good.  It is a great look at the coming of age of America at this time as well as Rock N Roll.  The script, Direction, and cinematography is well done.  of course, the music is a terrific accompaniment for this one.   Very funny footnote- the opening segment of Marc Maron's WTF Podcast comes from his role in this movie.",

            "content": "I think I fell in love with this movie because of the time it captured in history. I had a much older sister who loved music and she instilled that love of music in me. It was a time in my life that I think was truly the best of times--that sweet spot between the hippies of the 60's and before disco reared it's ugly head. So many great bands and artists from that time in my life that made it both the best of times and the worst of times. While I hadn't wanted to be a \"Band-Aid\" I listened to music studiously and my friends and I would sit in the family room of some kid's house, listening to Zepplin or The Doobie Brothers, debated about the lyrics-what inspired them or what they were really trying to say between the lines. We would wax poetic about who was the best guitarist or drummer while sneaking beer, smoking Marlboros (or other things). Almost Famous captures that time perfectly. Whenever I find myself needing to walk down memory lane, that's the movie I want to watch because it takes me there. I'm back sitting in a dingy room in a bean bag chair on some really ugly orange shag carpet-and I'm a teenager again.",

There isn't too much going on in the background, like a complete love story, but, anyway, I guess the idea of the script was really to depict a guy who just wanted to live his dream of accompany a big rock band that he was a big fan of, and his discoveries as an adolescent. I see people commenting that they were expecting a big story behind the movie, but it's simplicity is what made me love it the most. It's a reality of a band, the day by day, the backstage, a simple love story behind it as a background, and good music. And that is what rock is about, the feelings, the simplicity. Couldn't be better. Long live to rock and roll!",

            "content": "Cameron Crowe's \"Almost Famous\" is an ambitious, nostalgic and sprawling coming-of-age drama suggesting filmmakers deserve recounting their famous stories without vanity. With biographical drama, Crowe drew from his childhood memories to crafting a nostalgia portrait of rock-and-roll era defined by timeless aurra. Using spellbinding cinematography, Crowe draws viewers into an adolescent's almost famous journey of self-discovery in Rock-and-Roll music industry. Emulating Bradley Cooper's \"A Star is Born\", Crowe effectively uses lens flare lighting to foreshadow doomed fate awaiting a rock band unaware of being spyed on by journalists. Crowe showcases extraordinary control over production design, editing and music, creating euphoric cinematic experience. Crowe's script is also sensational, expertly employing voice-over narration to immerse viewers into a teenage journalists' mindset. It's hard to not appreciate astonishing performances. Patrick Fugit delivers career-defining child performance as Will. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys angst, desperation and regrets of teen hit the jackpot with opportunity to interview his favorite rock-stars. Kate Hudson is equally excellent in the role of a seductive rock-star that takes impressionable youth under her wing. In one of her finest roles, Hudson imbues sympathy into a heiress. Lastly, Billy Crudup  merits recognition. As aging rockstar, he brings immense swagger to the movie. Although \"Almost Famous'\" undeniably unforgettable period piece, ultimately it isn't flawless. At nearly three hours, it suffers from lengthy running-time testing viewer's patience. Moreover, it unintentionally glamorizes drug lifestyle encouraging youth to engage in substance abuse without showing its consequences. Nevertheless, fans of biopics will definitely enjoy \"Almost Famous\" and so will movie-goers looking for enlightening entertainment. Nearly 20 years after it shot to Almost Famous fame in Hollywood, it remains a prime example of the therapeutic value in tracing Boyhood memories across centuries studied by Breakfast Club societies despite teenagers on the Edge of Seventeen arguing that filmmaking is a strictly business rather than personal profession scarcely lending itself towards capturing Dazed and Confused uncertainty faced by Boy in Striped Pajamas confined in concentration camps ruled by police reminding inmates Life is Beautiful only for Nazis that aren't Scarfaced by refugees.",

            "content": "The film Almost Famous, directed by Cameron Crowe, does a fascinating job at depicting and illustrating the innocence and excitement that main character William Miller experiences as he dives into the real world of onset \"Rock and Roll.\" With this, Miller begins to understand the drama, beauty and love that comes with being a part of a famous band and sharing what you understand to love and what others praise the band for; their music. The film's soundtrack is the main theme that I would like to praise and bring to attention, and is the main reason why this film is so able to accurately portray and depict these scenes into real life emotions and make viewers like myself feel so connected to each and every clip. One scene that really grabbed my attention and helped put into play how this Films uses its music to illustrate and illuminate the emotion in every clip was Penny's overdose in the hotel room, with the song \"My Cherie Amour\" by Stevie Wonder playing over the scene. In this scene, William Miller has already announced his love for Penny as he holds her limp body up as she is severely intoxicated; She falls to the ground from all the drugs in her system, and as a precaution and fear of overdosing, William has already called the hotel paramedics to get a doctor for Penny. The doctors barge in as she falls, and help her to the sink area so they can blow up her stomach and induce vomit. This is when My Cherie Amour begins to play, which is a rather sweet and beautiful song. Dramatic irony is shown in this scene as generally a director would choose a more sad and dramatic song for a scene with someone throwing up and overdosing. But Crowes choice of music gives you chills as you watch Penny suffer and throw up, but at the same time look so beautiful as her legs and feet begin to curl up and her clothing falls off and her skin becomes more exposed; and at the end of the song and scene, the cameras go back to William who is smiling lightly and is showing emotions of true love, whilst staring at Penny and her beauty. William is so in love blinded by her beauty that even in a situation of death, all he can focus on is her. Without the director's choice of this beautiful upbeat love song, viewers would not have been able to grasp any of this disposition or chemical romance that is displayed in this scene, and it would've been depicted as a more tragic and sad scene, rather than one filled with bliss and romance, which is what the director intended to do. Each and every scene in this movie is followed by an amazing song that is specifically picked to help illustrate what emotion viewers are supposed to be grabbing from each scene, which truly makes this film such a masterpiece.",

This is also a film that attempts to capture the essence of the 70s and rock and roll all while balancing a love story and coming of age story. There's a lot going on here. While there is serious attention paid to the pitfalls of fame and success, the glare of the media, and balancing journalistic and personal relationships there's also plenty of screen time dedicated to teenage love and angst. At certain times it feels that the examination of the former is lacking because of the latter. Really, at the end of the day this is more a vehicle for a coming of age story rather than a story about the music. Yet the film would be lesser with one and not the other, or else it would become an entirely different creature to say the least. The band on the run plot trods well into familiar territory and spins the same wheels that other films such as Spinal Tap have done better.",

It is a complex and heartfelt Dramedy, complete with some very funny moments, some really hard-hitting emotional beats, and one of the most satisfying endings of any movie I can think of.  Each character is expertly performed and wonderfully written, and honestly if I discovered there was a 3 hour extended cut of this movie, I would gladly sit down to watch it.  The movie centers around William Miller, someone who any aspiring writer/philosopher/visionary can relate to, as he is a social outcast, has no luck with girls and struggles with the fact that nobody will take him seriously, even if they like him.  His tale is mostly about him going on the road with one of his favorite bands after they invite him with them after he approaches them for an Interview for Rolling Stone, and he is witness to the triumphs, the chaos, and most compelling, the immensely complicated group psychology of the band he is travelling with, and every one of these facets work to almost perfection.  Basically, imagine everything you can do right with a Road movie, combine it with a Rock and Roll movie, and top that off with a very effective and powerful Bittersweet Love Story, and you have Almost Famous.  I'm generally not one to ever say that you should judge a person on their opinion of a movie you love or hate, but this is such a tender and thoughtful film that if you know someone who has seen it and genuinely hated it, then there's a solid chance they just might be a bad person.",

            "content": "Where did Cameron Crowe's career go? He produced several classic films in the late 1980s and 1990s but with the release of middling We Bought a Zoo (2011) and the awful Elizabethtown (2005) he appears to be on a downward trajectory. It is nice to remember what made him such an acclaimed filmmaker as he does represent the coming of age of sensitive young men with sweetness and specificity and captures the look and feel of the 1970s expertly. The film is funny without betraying the pains that the characters in the film experience and the struggle of becoming a man in an era that allowed for such great freedom.\n\nTeenage prodigy William Miller, Patrick Fugit, grows up in the 1970s as a music lover restricted by his conservative mother Elaine, Frances McDormand, and suburban life. He escapes from this world by writing articles for publications that cover music and is eventually hired by Ben Fong-Torres to cover the ascendant band Stillwater while they are on tour. He befriends groupie Penny Lane, Kate Hudson, who is having an affair with the band's lead guitarist Russell Hammond, Billy Crudup. Miller attempts to cover the band objectively but realizes that their actions may be immoral as Hammond treats Lane poorly and tensions erupt within the band over who is acknowledged as the lead singer. He ends up writing a highly critical article about the band which is well received by his employers but refuted by an angered Hammond. He returns home after this event and ruminates on his time with the band and his experiences with Lane who has stopped being a groupie in the face of Hammond's mistreatment. Lane facilitates a reconciliation between Miller and Hammond that allows for the article to be published and for both men to continue pursuing their career ambitions.\n\nThe character of Penny Lane has become famous as she is allegedly based on notable real life figures such as Bebe Buell but this is probably because the film is able to tap into the deep insecurity and sadness that comes with being used for sex. She angrily protests that she is a \"Band Aid\" and is there for the music and not simply to sleep with famous men but this is clearly not how Hammond, already in a serious relationship, views her. She tries her hardest to keep up the fa\u00e7ade of a breezy, happy girl willing to go along with anything but when she is carelessly gambled away by the man she has come to love she cannot keep it together anymore. We see her through the eyes of a young man who adores her because she is beautiful and seems like such a free spirit but even he begins to notice that she is vulnerable and her relationship with Hammond is toxic. At the end of the film we know that Miller now understands that women are more than just their physical appearances and feel things just as deeply as men even if they appear to have not a care in the world.\n\nThe film also has a beautiful rhythm to it as it moves slowly and without urgency as Miller absorbs the environment around him and the romantic side of the music world during this time period is explored. We will stop briefly for the band and all of their entourage to sing Elton John's \"Tiny Dancer\" together or for Lane to perform an impromptu dance. There would not be room for these moments in a different film but Crowe gets the relaxed attitude that most of this strange crew of people would have had during this tour and the culture that allowed for some of the worst actions that the band took. Crowe is willing to spend time with these characters when they are not at the high points of drama and are simply going through the motions of everyday life and that is what makes him so special as a writer-director.\n\nYou also feel as though Crowe really does identify with his main character, this is a semi-autobiographical film, so even when he makes mistakes or miscalculates situations he is sympathetic and this means that the film is more lovable than some of the more cynical deconstructions of rock bands from this era.",

The film's ecstatic atmosphere is only briefly interrupted by the sense of longing that is associated with first love and the pain that accompanies the inevitable separation between a child and a parent. Crowe's fourth feature represents another unqualified success for the director, who has yet to have a bad outing. The movie has a great classic rock soundtrack (including some new songs by Peter Frampton) and strong production values that enhance the illusion that Crowe has turned back the clock by a quarter of a century. Almost Famous takes things to the next level, allowing us to believe that the motion picture is transpiring during the era when it is supposed to be taking place.",

Even the weaving of the structure that occurs in front of the audience in its initial stages, is breathtaking with monologues, debates and \"teenage fun\" bits that makes it slick. \n\nThe songs are uplifting, the backyard score is decently scored, the cinematography is mesmerizing with fine editing and stunning camera work and visuals with live locations that foliates it into the anticipated musical cinematic experience. Hudson is surprisingly good with Crudup and Lane going head to head offering the appropriate crisp to their track and McDormand as always offering the gravitas and keeps this fairy tale grounded. \n\nCrowe's narration is far better than we usually get in such band musicals and the primary reason to that is that it is perfectly balanced, it never is too light nor dark, he is well aware of his audience and he can filter them out with maturity itself. His execution is definitely worth the script he wrote, in fact if anything it celebrates it with an extravaganza for life where each emotional conflict is respected equally with a subtle tone. The behind the stage preparations and conversations that a star goes through, the originality and innocence of the concept and Crowe oozing his presence behind all of it are the high points of the feature. \n\nAlmost Famous is pure art that both lyrically rhymes and taps to the beat and eventually make you too.",

            "content": "First things first, I accidentally watched the Director's Cut of the film which is 162 minutes long (40 minutes longer than the released film, which I haven't seen).  I'm not certain whether the extra time benefits the film or reduces its quality.  There were a few places where things felt long or indulgent.  But, of course, the whole premise is pretty indulgent - this is the story of Cameron Crowe's experience as a teen journalist for Rolling Stone touring with The Allman Brothers (here replaced by a fictional band, Stillwater, starring Billy Crudup and Jason Lee).  Crowe wrote and directed the film and gives himself a pretty glorified part.  Moreover, taking place in the early 1970s, the action onscreen is also indulgent, in that there is lots of drinking and drug use (although this is mostly implied because the film seems somehow to be aiming for family friendly, despite the debauchery).  Which brings me to the question of whether this film feels \"right\" in the era of #MeToo.  In fact, it doesn't.  Kate Hudson is the groupie with the heart of gold and, although the film acknowledges that she is treated badly by the band, it doesn't really make any effort to condemn that treatment, at least not strenuously.  Instead, it is nostalgic good times all the way and the rockin' soundtrack doesn't hurt that sentiment one bit.  Crowe spends his time trying to depict the emotional journey of the hero (himself, played wide-eyed by Patrick Fugit) and he does manage to capture wistful naivete pretty well (a la your typical coming-of-age story), including a delayed coda that makes it all right.  A few scenes do suggest that the film could have verged into Spinal Tap territory, but it doesn't (too bad).  However, this may be the only fiction film to ever have someone play Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and that's worth the price of admission on its own.",

            "content": "Earning Cameron Crowe an Academy Award for his screenplay and featuring an array of critically acclaimed performances, Almost Famous had all the acclaim of a necessary viewing pleasure.\n\nTaking audiences back to the glory of a superior age in music history, Almost Famous' story occurs deep within the rock n' roll scene of the 1970's. While providing viewers with a nostalgic time period as the central backdrop, Almost Famous simultaneously functions as a compelling coming-of-age story and a glorious spectacle of rock n' roll. Audiences are given an insight into a protagonist learning what it is to become a man and his discovery of what lies inside the music scene.\nThere are a lot of characters in Almost Famous, but it always comes back to the two main figures. This is William Miller and Penny Lane, a couple who share a really confusing relationship. There is no telling what direction it is developing towards in or what the implications of their interactions infers, taking audiences on an unpredictable ride. The confusion the audience feels does not come from a convoluted narrative; it comes from a story which is written and directed with such finesse that the viewer is able to see it all through the eyes of the protagonist. The confusion audiences get in attempting to understand or predict where things are going gives them a perspective on what it is to fall in love. William Miller goes through his own coming of age experience over the course of the narrative which is a supporting theme in the story, and the confusing emotions he has to face as he grows closer to adulthood make him a really compelling character. The fact that Cameron Crower's screenplay hits this note with such perfection just goes to show how much of a personal piece the film is for him. Almost Famous is a deeply insightful and moving film which is extremely rich in characterization, and this stretches beyond the main characters.\nRather than simply pumping the narrative with sex and drugs, Almost Famous uses these as an afterthought in a story which really humanizes its music stars. We don't just see the party; we see the people who are partying. Almost Famous shows the inner machinations of the fictional band Stillwater and examines the brotherhood and conflict of them. We learn of their relationships with each other and what it is to be a rock star through a story which directly asks them. There are a lot of characters to keep up with and even with the slow pace of the film and extensive running time it still remains a challenge to track it all, but with such vibrant energy in the dialogue the film proves worthy of its weight. \nAnd in capturing the glitz and glam of its time setting, Almost Famous utilizes a very effective visual style. The cinematography maintains a mix of elements from a 70's film and a music video which supports the timeframe and themes of the narrative. The scenery is appealing and the colour scheme captures a somewhat hypnotic mood at times, but the real stylish glory can be credited to the soundtrack. I didn't know what to expect from Almost Famous as a whole, but the fact that this precise subject matter snagged me at a time when I was getting deep into the 70's is just perfect. Given that my contemporary obsession rests on the song \"Simple Man\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd which was featured on the soundtrack to Almost Famous, there is clearly no better time for me to be viewing such a film. The entire soundtrack to Almost Famous is a remarkable testament to a pinnacle era in music history which uses many classics without playing the overused ones, mixing it up with a strong collection of great bands and musicians contributing to create an awesome atmosphere.\nAnd with such powerful backing, the cast in Almost Famous contribute some strong performances.\nPatrick Fugit makes a perfect lead in Almost Famous. Portraying William Miller who is intentionally based on writer-director Cameron Crowe himself, Patrick Fugit captures the perfect state of mind for his character. Balancing his determination to prove journalistic brilliance with his confusion that comes with growing up and saying farewell to his childhood innocence, Patrick Fugit captures an ambitious young character who audiences can easily sympathise with. His is often stoic as he watches the world around him change, and the subtlest developments in his facial expressions say everything that the character needs to without him having to actually say the words. The young boy interacts with a colourful collection of characters and always does it in such a sophisticated manner that it does many favours for the development of his character, keeping him an enticing central subject for the film. Patrick Fugit's constant sense of curiosity provides audiences with someone to join in their plight to discover the world of rock n' roll, and the way he develops as his character grows up over the course of the story is steadily paced and entertaining. Patrick Fugit provides a perfect portrait of the ambitious youth that Cameron Crowe once was. \nBillie Crudup makes for a perfect fit as Russell Hammond. His characterization of the rock star stands out not for his party nature, but for his chemistry with Patrick Fugit. While William Miller is a man with a lot to learn, Russell Hammond is a man with a lot to say which he does with a real genuine feeling to him. His interactions with Kate Hudson constantly feel like a real emotional conflict, but the scenes where William Miller attempts to look inside the man are the real finest moments. He constantly has a barrier up, yet at the same time he is able to speak insightful wisdom which says so much while still hiding so much. Billie Crudup makes Russell Hammond a character audiences really want to discover the secrets of, and his genuine passion is very strong.\nKate Hudson also brings in a fine supporting performance. With rich confidence and a constant sense of mystery about her, Kate Hudson makes a commanding presence which is executed with hypnotic subtlety. She seduces audiences into falling in love with her elusive nature in the same way she does for the protagonist, and it is done through capturing a really spaced-out state of mind which makes her seem as if she is on another planet. Kate Hudson has a constantly sly nature about her and is never predictable, successfully emphasising that Penny Lane is a legend of sorts. There are select moments in the film where she displays a greater variety of emotion for brief periods, and these keep audiences enticed through reminding them of the human that lies beneath. Kate Hudson is a mysterious presence in Almost Famous, and her dedication to the role is nothing short of tenacious.\nFrances McDormand lends some hilarious support. Long a talented performer in the art of comedy, Frances McDormand's portrayal of the overbearing square mother to William Miller is perfect at every time. Being the single-handed representation of the generation gap in the story, Frances McDormand plays the role with such genuine passion to find drama in it that the result is effectively hilarious. Her performance is largely a dramatic one yet the context of the story makes her a source of comic relief, and she displays an effective talent at doing it. Frances McDormand's clever transcendence of a character that constantly has risk of becoming an archetype makes her far more than a simple side character even though her relevance to the overall narrative is rather minuscule. \nJason Lee brings a passionate supporting performance in, and both Fairuza Balk and Phillip Seymour Hoffman make a stamp with their manic energy. Rainn Wilson is also a nostalgic presence when considering his later success on The Office (2005-2013). \n\nAlmost Famous has a lot of ambition which stretches out over a long running time, but the brilliant dialogue ensures that the pacing supports the actors in delivering some brilliant performances that make this coming of age throwback to the 1970's a truly groovy film.",

I really love the background we see on the character of William, and how he gets hooked in with Stillwater. He is our surrogate in the story, and I like how it eases us into this world of sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll. Kate Hudson is also charming as the girl who swears she's not a groupie, that grows too attached to one guy. I have heard that this is loosely based on some real events that Cameron Crowe went through himself, which makes sense because everything feels so genuine, and you can also sense the passion he has for the music that is sprinkled throughout the film. I think where I have difficulty connecting the dots in movies like this is when they make it clear that William is forming an emotional attachment to the band. It doesn't feel like there is any basis for his affection for these guys as they continue to distrust and mistreat him. Yet his character qualities of extreme loyalty and trustworthiness make him a standout anyways. I thought the cast was easily the highlight of the film, because they all fit perfectly, and sold the story. The biggest highlights were Frances McDormand and Philip Seymour Hoffman who served as different kinds of advisers/protectors to William. I can easily see why this film is greatly admired by so many people. I think it lacks a little something to fully engage my personal interest (possibly because I'm not a big fan of rock-and-roll) but that doesn't mean it isn't well-made and entertaining throughout.",

The movie depicts all the backstage stories of rock bands in the best way possible being soooo close to the real situation that it's amazing. \n\nIt's a movie that does not hesitate to describe things as they happen and it gives the average person a really accurate view of how the industry of show business used to work at the time (or still does). The Jimmy Fallon appearance was also something that I was unaware about and I was thunderstruck by his amazing haircut!

Frances McDormand is incredible as the strict single parent, who allows her son to go out and tour with the rock and roll band Still Water for Rolling Stone magazine. I will say too, that Kate Hudson, is really wonderful too in this movie as the rock and roll bands groupie, who Patrick Fugit, who plays the 15 year old boy William Miller, falls in love with while on tour with the rock band. This whole movie is really a classic depiction of life in a rock and roll band from the 1970's as many will argue that \"Dazed and Confused\" is the best depiction of the 1970's, and they would be right, but the fact that Cameron Crowe allows us to go on this wonderful with a rock and roll group from the 1970's and to see how fame can bring together, and destroy a rock group. It's a fascinating depiction of life in the 1970's at that time and why their will never be a time when the 60's and 70's will ever happen again in America, and why the 1970's was really the last great era of rock and roll.",

Along the way he goes to parties, concerts, and gets tangled up in a love triangle between the main guitarist and a super fan played by Kate Hudson. I saw this film once about a year ago and just liked it. Seeing it again, I really enjoyed it. I had a smile on my face the whole way through. I used to think Kate Hudson's role wasn't realistic, but after a whole new year of living and experiences, I can say that I've met this type of person before. Living life without anything taken seriously and always living your dreams. Sometimes I wish I was like that. Drop everything and move to another part of the world. Someday maybe, who knows.

The cast is deep and deliver strong performances. A captivating look into rock-and-roll circa 1970.  The film is not really about any one particular theme be it young love, discovery or friendship. It is really more of a trip, a road trip, discovering and probing all of these things and more. I like to think of it as a look into the nature of basic human relationships (in their many forms) tested by the turmoil of sex, drugs and rock-and-roll. Sometimes people do noble things, sometimes selfish thing, but always believable things. \n\nAll of these elements create a very warm film that is surprisingly human in its approach. The sound track is also very strong and paired well with each scene. One scene was particularly memorable: a simple sing-a-long on a bus against the back drop of a classic song. Most people have at least one strong memory of this simple true Americana pleasure from their childhood, and this scene taps into that emotion. \n\nThis was, in my humble opinion, Cameron Crowe's last really strong movie after a number of hits (including Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Say Anything and Singles). These movies all share a common bond in that they were crafted with care, attention and a sharp eye for detail creating engrossing time capsules of these time periods (or places) and the social relationships of the characters. \n\nMy small critique of this film, and most of Crowe's work, is that he can be heavy handed with the sitcom one-liners. While some of these lines pay off really well, others are a bit jarring.",

It wanted to have this \"message\" about who we are and what rock and roll means to us. \n\nRemember \"Rock & Roll High School\" where it ends with Joey Ramone blowing up the school? That movie didn't need a message. Sure it wasn't an overly complex plot that bordered on cartoony, but it didn't try to be.

Jerry Maguire may not be a reflection of the director's own personal life but one can sense the emotions of some of the key characters within that film are inspired from his own life. Almost Famous takes it one step further by providing a semi-biographical retelling of his experience when he worked for Rolling Stone magazine. Crowe has provided us a glimpse of his past, the people he has met, and the experiences that he went through.\n\nThe film's premise is certainly an interesting one, about a 15 year old boy traveling with a band and covering a story on them during their days on tour. Cameron Crowe, who not only directed the film but also wrote the screenplay, has provided the audience with a protagonist, William Miller that does not constantly prove his value to the people around him; there are very few instances that demonstrate the intelligence of the character, especially in regards to music. The film explores aspects of the character that we wouldn't expect from an individual like him; through this not only do we get under the skin of William but also Crowe. Though I personally feel the film is not crawling deep enough on exploring William Miller; there were many portions throughout the film, where Miller's concerns were secondary to the band he was following. I think also due to the fact that William is a slightly tweaked manifestation of Crowe himself, it made him reluctant to have the film place judgement on the character; there were simply not enough moments of the character showing his deeper colors.\n\nI did however enjoy Crowe's ability to draw his audiences in to the world of music that very few know, documenting the hardships and beauty of both the protagonist and the band he follows, Stillwater. Though it takes on an objective, journalistic perspective, it could also be translated to a fan's perspective; showing us the situations, emotions and connection they go through and make during in their commitment to follow them. The film may not get inside the head of Penny Lane's character, which is the band's true fan, but Crowe was able to compensate with the character's relationship with William, which allowed the audience to connect with the character at a deeper level.\n\nThe film could have taken a very easy route and dramatize the hell out of its subjects and used that as a sort plot driver for an impacting third act or conclusion, but instead Crowe sets the film in such a way that is unpredictable; he does not set an emotional goal for its characters and lets the audience sit back and just take in new experiences, similar to what William is going through in the film.\n\nCrowe paces the film effectively with sharing focus on multiple subjects, while also never reaching to a point of complete bias. This allowed the film to feel brisk and smooth, flying by its two hours and 42 minutes without a bump or a hiccup. I would not have minded if Crowe would ever decide to add more scenes in its already lengthy running time, as it would have allowed Almost Famous to be as close to Crowe's own personal experience as possible.\n\nCameron Crowe rallies up a fantastic ensemble cast that provides performances that are of equal praise. Patrick Fugit as William Miller and Billy Crudup as Russell Hammond provided outstanding performances; they were responsible for the film's emotions and were delivered in such a way that never at all felt forced or overly sentimental. Crowe directs them with such precision and emotional charge that it would be difficult to believe that we are watching fictional individuals. Kate Hudson's Penny Lane fuels the film's sense of ambiguity, relying more on her physical rather than her verbal performance; therefore it is required by us, as the audience, to gain our own interpretation of who she really is and the meaning behind her personal relationships. Frances McDormand as the mother of William was also strong, even if her presence is not as prominent as the other three members of the cast. She could have easily played the role with antagonistic drive, but she was able to make her sympathetic, which if the hands of another actress may not be possible, or would be as effective.\n\nAlmost Famous is a wonderful film that draws out genuine emotions and interesting stories of an era in music that many may have forgotten or that could only be found in the minds of the people that lived through it; Crowe takes these emotions and experiences and places it on screen for us to also take in.

            "content": "I think at one point or another we all want to be famous. Whether it's being an actor, singer, or an athlete we all tend to want to live the life of a famous person. Almost Famous gives us a breathtaking view of the music industry and one kid just trying to write an article for Rolling Stone on the band Stillwater. When you get past the fact that a 15 year old being allowed to travel with a band, and even getting an article published by Rolling Stone, it's a masterpiece of a film. It takes a little while before each actor settles into their role. I wasn't too keen on the newcomer Patrick Fugit for the first hour but he really stepped it up in the second half.\n\nBilly Crudup gives his best performance that I have seen so far and Kate Hudson is great in her career defining role of Penny Lane. The family dynamic to begin the film was a bit boring and Zooey Deschanel was forgettable but once William leaves with the band everything about this movie becomes great. Frances McDormand was an increasingly sympathetic character and Crudup had a great character arc. Fugit was as good as any child/teen has been in film in a long time and shared many memorable scenes with Crudup and Hudson in which he basically out-shined two Oscar caliber actors.\n\nIt's very hard to make a great film based on or around the music industry. Almost Famous is one of the few films that take you into the world and time frame but also make you want to go listen to that particular band or genre immediately after. I can't stress how much I enjoyed this film and in particular the last 45 minutes. It was emotionally captivating and renewed my love for film once again. It didn't go too far in exploiting the music industry but it also didn't glorify the life in any way either. It's near perfect filmmaking and filled with career best performances.\n\n(edited 9/15/14) After thinking about this movie for a day, I have realized it's a 10/10 not a 9.7. It really shows us how music can actually change people and how it's such a beautiful way to connect with people. A job well done Crowe.\n\n+Fugit out-shined the entire cast \n\n+Hudson and Crudup give career defining performances \n\n+Music based film that works \n\n+Last 45 minutes are emotionally captivating \n\n+Relatable coming of age story about something not usually relatable \n\n-Slow start \n\n10/10",

            "content": "During Almost Famous, I was confused. Where is this movie going? What is happenning? However, something kept my eyes glued to the screen, and I don't know if it was the sexy music, the quirky dialogue or the excellent era representation but it was riveting. And then, when the credits roll, I was at the border of an emotional breakdown. I realized. Almost Famous is Cameron Crowe magic.\nIf you are a fan of 70's rock then you are in for a treat. Let me first advise you that the Stillwater in the movie is not THE \"Stillwater\" rock band you all know, and that the film is not based on them. It is based on a rock band in the stairway to fame, and tells the coming-of-age story of William Miller (Patrick Fugit), a young Rolling Stone journalist that goes on tour with them, and discovers about humanity like never before.\nI was always a sucker for coming-of-age stories so maybe that helped. The music helped too. The dialogue, everything. The script is so witty, and delivers some heart-warming moments. Fugit is a very good lead, but the star is Kate Hudson as the mesmerizing trainwreck Penny Lane, who steals every scene with her seductive beauty. Also, I have to mention Frances McDormand as Elaine Miller, the mother of William. It's McDormand. You know she is going to be amazing.\nThis film is on the road to become a cult classic. And even though it's difficult to get on the first viewing, you can't wait to see it again, as Crowe's terrific dramedy storytelling is superb in this movie. Almost Famous is a nostalgia ride that is full of heart and good intentions. It keeps you in the edge of your seat without offering much than conversations between complex people that are very difficult to understand. And if you like Elton John's \"Tiny Dancer\", there is this scene on a bus where you will find yourself chanting along with the cast.",

            "content": "This was my favorite film for years after I saw it.  It is pure magic.  It is insufficient to call it an all-time coming of age, adventure or rock movie.  It is a wondrous evocation of an extended moment, a living reflection of a dream (if you will) seen through starry eyes.  It is an imagining and depiction of the beautiful futility of finding and holding on to a moment and its afterglow, the sustain after the guitar solo, or if you will, the empty auditorium.  And finally, the clarity to let it be a wrinkle in time.\n\nCameron Crowe did something here no one else could do or will do.  More than any other respected filmmaker, he fearlessly dances with sentimentality, striving for poignance, even if it ends up as schmaltz.  This has yielded uneven results in his prior catalogue, but In Almost Famous, it is always the former and never the latter.  He dares to find innocent love, of more than one variety, at the peak of 70's rock and roll greatness, before all that was left was druggy burnout.  He dares to make the most easily caricatured fixture, the groupie (err....bandaid),  a stunning embodiment of vulnerability, confusion, curiosity and sparkle.  Penny Lane, brought to incandescent life by Kate Hudson, is one of the all-time great characters in cinema, because she is everything she appears to be yet so much more.  That is the secret to the indelible characters in this movie.  They seem like flesh and blood visions of the mythical haze of early 70's rock culture, which they are, but they're also earthy and recognizable, in their hopes and vulnerabilities.   \n\nThis movie is a lovely paean to the pop-American experience, a snapshot of the collective trip of 70's rock culture as a vision of the American Dream, mythical yet frozen in memory, yearned for and felt if never entirely realized.",

            "content": "Okay, let's begin by saying that there was honestly very little chance that I wasn't going to like this film. Almost Famous is set in the 1970s, a time that (although I never lived in it) I am extremely nostalgic for. Everything about this film, from its humor, its culture, its characters, and its soundtrack are expertly woven together in a film perfectly concocted to work its way into my heart. Seriously... there is a girl named Penny Lane in this movie. Was there the slightest chance that I wasn't going to enjoy myself? If that wasn't good enough, listen to this: Almost Famous stars Patrick Fugit as William, a teenager who adores rock and roll and dreams of one day becoming a music critic. Okay, really? Coming of age story? Rock and roll? WRITING AND CRITIQUING THINGS? Cameron Crowe, stop trying to weave everything I love into movies. It's freaking me out. Honestly though, this movie hits home constantly in a big way for me, so pay my opinion on it no mind. I was pretty easily manipulated by it, so if you want to call it \"corny\" or \"sentimental,\" be my guest. Although it will always have a special place in my heart due to its subject matter and its great cast.\r\n\r\nAfter meeting his hero (Philip Seymour Hoffman), William gets serious about writing pieces on bands and albums. One such piece is picked up by Hoffman and published, leading to a gig for William at Rolling Stone-they want him to follow the band Stillwater on tour and write a piece on them. On the trip, William encounters sexually liberated groupies who call themselves the \"Band-Aids,\" an egotistical musician who refers to himself as a golden God, and a whole lotta weed. Sounds generic? Not really. This is one of those films that, in synopsis, sounds simplistic, yet once you actually watch it you start to wonder how and why nobody did anything like this before. This film is not just a love letter to the culture of the 70s. It is funny, intelligent, irreverent, and extremely witty.\r\n\r\nAt times, it seems as though Almost Famous owes more to This Is Spinal Tap than other genre classics such as Dazed and Confused-and it's a good thing too, because if this film had been too openly nostalgic even I would have balked at it. But it skewers the mentality and culture of every aspect of the era it takes place in almost as often as it reflects on them wistfully. There's a whole range of lifestyles caught up here, from the rebellious daughter to the overprotective mother to the disgruntled band member who gets left in the shadows. The exchanges between the members of Stillwater (which, I might remind you, is a very real band) is consistently funny, and reveals everything about rock bands that you always assumed was true. \"I work just as hard or harder than anybody on that stage. You know what I do? I connect. I get people off. I look for the guy who isn't getting off, and I make him get off.\" What does that even mean? Who knows? Who cares? The whole film is such a glorious acid trip that I'm certain the audience won't by the time it's over.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack, of course, is consistently good, featuring everything from A to Zeppelin. But although this movie is certainly about music, it's the people who make it great. Often, people will say that a film is only as good as its villain. Well, Almost Famous has no villain-at least in the traditional sense. What makes this film all the more powerful is the looming knowledge in the backs of these character's minds that someday, all of this will have to end through either death or the slow crushing of their dreams. Hell, Hoffman's character prophesies the end of rock and roll within the film's first ten minutes. So perhaps this movie is about the battle against a far more elusive enemy-the slow yet inevitable passage of time. Or, even better, the ever-raging war between the cool and the decidedly uncool. And what's cool about this film is that it KNOWS how cool it is.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Almost Famous: 8/10 stars. Yeah, I know... sentimental pick, right? Well, don't chalk it all up to that, because this is a legitimately good movie. I never thought that the dork who directed Jerry Maguire would make a film that I enjoy this much, but it has amazingly happened. And in spectacular fashion, no less. This movie is funny as hell, but it's never forced-it's just hilarious in an easygoing, peaceful, serene way. There's something to be said for a film that you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy, and finish off feeling calm, cool, and collected. And this movie certainly fits that bill.",

            "content": "Why did I wait so long to watch this? Almost Famous is a phenomenal dramedy and love letter to rock music and the 1970's. Much like the music it explores, it's a free-spirited, crazy whirlwind about life and every moment of this film reflects the very nature of such subjects, while also having a variety of poignant moments and themes. It's a smart film, and also a very funny and heartfelt one. If you love rock music and have a fascination with the 70's, let me try to explain why you should watch Almost Famous, though my words will never do the film justice.\n\nThe story begins in 1969, with an awkward 11-year-old boy named William who lives with eccentric college professor mother, and his older, rebellious sister, Anita. The family dynamic is strange as it is, since their mother strongly disapproves of a number of things, including rock music, or celebrating Christmas in September to avoid commercialism of the holiday.\n\nAfter a heated argument, Anita moves out of the house with her boyfriend to become a stewardess, but she leaves behind her rock records for her brother so according to her, \"They will set you free.\" Sure enough, once he begins exploring the temptations of rock and roll, William's worldview suddenly changes along with his whole life.\n\nShoot forward to 1973, and now William is 15 and still very awkward, but he now has an intense passion for rock music - even sending in articles he had written about rock music to a Creem Magazine, which critiques rock music. He even meets critic, Lester Bangs, who is impressed by William's articles, even though he says that William is too late and that rock music is dying.\n\nStill, he decides to give William a chance to make a name for himself by writing an article for the magazine critiquing a Black Sabbath concert. William is excited about the project, though he encounters trouble trying to get backstage since he is \"not on the list\" of people who can go backstage.\n\nWhile failing repeatedly to get backstage, he meets a group of girls who refer to themselves as \"Band Aids\" who are sort of like groupies, but without having as much sex and are more like huge fans hanging around the bands. However, even they can't get him backstage, despite promises from an attractive, curly-haired blonde girl known later on as Penny Lane.\n\nAfter another failed attempt, he has an encounter with a band called Stillwater, which is playing the opening act as they arrive late and try to make their way backstage. William tries to get an interview with them, but they first tell him to fuck off because he's a reporter for Creem Magazine, which trashed them in past reviews. However, he praises their newest work, and the band reconsiders an interview and get him backstage with them and the Band Aid girls. From this concert, he develops a new friendship with the band and the girls.\n\nHis articles soon catch the attention of Rolling Stone Magazine, which commissions him to write an article as he follows the band, Stillwater, sending him on a wild ride of band drama, sex, drugs, partying, and of course, rock music, all while he tries to get proper interviews from the band members. He also begins to fall in love with mysterious Penny Lane and tries to learn more about her as well.\n\nThe story is excellent as it manages to successfully blend drama with comedy effortlessly. Never do these genres clash with one another. The story is also further bolstered by the eccentric cast of characters, which is to be expected from a film about rock music and the 1970's, and these characters are fascinating to explore. I was also surprised by the sheer number of topics and themes the story managed to explore like covering all the torrid drama that occurs among bands, falling in love, the effects of success, drugs, sex, partying, family, friendship, and more. Some have complained that the story has a very \"been there, done that\" sort of feel, but it explores these familiar ideas expertly and makes them feel fresh again, without ever pounding the viewer with schmaltz.\n\nThe acting across the board is stellar, but there were three in particular that stood out among a cast of greats. Billy Crudup as the lead singer, Russell Hammond, provides the right amounts of crazy and egocentric, but also manages to fuse his character with heart and compassion. Patrick Fugit as the awkward William Miller was a dead-on casting choice since he perfectly conveyed the awkward teenage character, but also handled dramatic scenes very well. And the performance by Kate Hudson as the enigmatic Penny Lane was fantastic, and it's a shame to see that she doesn't do good films anymore (Oh, dear God...Bride Wars. The horror...the absolute horror. WHY?).\n\nAs far as entertainment goes, it will prove to be a blast for anyone who loves rock music, 1970's-centric films, lovers of good dramas, and anyone who has taste for a good comedy. It's a wild, hilarious, exhilarating, and heartfelt 2 hours of very breezy entertainment that is over in the blink of an eye because it is so damn entertaining from start to finish. There is never a moment of boredom to be had, to say the least.\n\nAlmost Famous is a superb dramedy. With great direction, great acting, a wonderful soundtrack, superb storytelling, hilarious humor, and heartfelt moments, it should appeal to a wide variety of moviegoers because there's a lot of good stuff to be found. It's definitely one of the best films of the 21st century and it deserved every bit of acclaim thrown at it. I highly recommend it.",

From the frequent saying \"It's all happening\" to  emotionless glare of William Miller, the film captures a perfect coming of age story which every one should watch. Cameron Crowe did an amazing job putting this witty and clever script and fun story together. The film is based on his life as it captures a 15 year old gifted writer who goes along with rising rock band. Along that journey, he deals with the ideas of loving rock music not endorsing the system, love, temptations, and what makes life life. Each character you grow to love and what makes the film good is the vulnerability of the young mind of William Miller. You can feel for him as he grasps the reality of the world of rock stars and the media's dilemma. Characters like Penny Lane, Russell Hammond and Jeff Bebe made the film colorful and you would end up falling in love with them as they go on their tour across America. Small stuff like having Lester Bangs and Ben Fong-Torres just seals the deal. Even though the word is overused in my ratings but this film makes you feel warm and questions yourself whether you're living the life you want or the life that is made for you. I love those type of films. In the end, I LOVE this film and recommend this to everyone.

He doesn't and can't seem to articulate what it is he loves or knows about music.  Now, I know writing about music is like dancing about architecture, but because that articulation of music seems so central to William's journalistic aspirations, the movie needs to be more than just a coming-of-age road trip with surface treatment of the sexdrugsrockandroll trifecta.\n\nKate Hudson's woodsy, backlit scene of her laughingly asking, \"What kind of beer [was I sold for]?\" with those smooth, limpid tears rolling down is indeed a notable performance.

            "content": "Very interesting take on a teenager named William Miller (Patrick Fujit) who is in desperation to live his controlling mother (Frances McDormand) to pursue a career as a writer for Rolling Stone Magazine. His love for rock music was inspired by his older sister (Zooey Deschanel), who left four years earlier, and he ventures off onto a tour with this aspiring famous group called Stillwater (never existed, just fictional for the film's purpose). William ends up touring with the group (which includes actors Jason Lee and Billy Crudup) and several groupies that often hook up with them. One of them (Kate Hudson) initiates a very close relationship with William. Surprisingly effective and funny movie that manages to integrate well-known rock music at the time (like \"The Who\" and \"The Guess Who\") into the movie's soundtrack. Usually when these films use songs as their primary score, that gets annoying pretty fast, but this one didn't because that's what \"Almost Famous\" was all about and it used the music in moderation. Performances are fine in all regards, as everyone is essential and very contributable to story's success. Quite compelling and as I had watched the director's cut as oppose to the theatrical lease, I cannot imagine what important segments during the shortened version were eliminated. It is not overlong by any means at 160 minutes. It works for that length. Finally a film worth watching from the year 2000 (which has not delivered a lot of good films).",

This is a flawless coming-of-age tale that is perfect in every sense of the word.  \n\n15-year-old William Miller (Patrick Fugit) has a passion for rock & roll.  Although his strict mother Elaine (Frances McDormand) doesn't approve of his interest, William spends his time writing album reviews for a local paper.  When his work attracts the attention of Ben Fong-Torres (Terry Chen), editor for Rolling Stone, William is offered an assignment of a 3,000 word cover-story on up-and-coming rock band Stillwater.  William hits the road with Stillwater, where he becomes friends with guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and singer Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee).  William also becomes infatuated with Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), a groupie traveling with the band.  As he works on his story, William experiences life in the road with a rock band.  \n\nNow I must say, I'm not a huge fan of the classic rock genre, but that doesn't matter.  This movie goes so much deeper than that.  The cast here is outstanding, highlighted by Patrick Fugit, Russell Hammond, and of course the gorgeous Kate Hudson.  You also have fantastic supporting roles from the likes of Frances McDormand and Philip Seymour Hoffman, among many others.  The acting is so genuine, each role is perfectly embraced.  \n\nI watched the nearly-three hour Director's Cut, which I wasn't sure about due to it's length.  When the movie wrapped up, it didn't even feel like that much time had gone by.  The story and characters are just so engrossing that the run-time wasn't even an issue.  I'm a sucker for coming-of-age films, and this is easily one of the best I have seen.  Watching this young kid being thrown into the world of rock & roll is truly fascinating, as well as seeing the relationship he forms with a troubled groupie who doesn't know any better.  Almost Famous is a beautiful film, a true masterpiece.  5 stars.",

This was believed to be semi-autobiographical based on his personal experiences as a teen reporter for Rolling Stone magazine. Now with real life experiences, everything in the movie just felt so real, so congratulations Cameron Crowe, with this film, you just proved to the world you are one of the best directors of today.\n\nNext, Patrick Fugit. This guy he's a newcomer, he also has a funny last name. But God was he brilliant! He can properly express all his feelings, love, emotions, anger, interest, he was a genius this guy. He should be a top actor today, he really should be making lots of money and getting all the fame. This guy is talented actor everyone!\n\nNow, Kate Hudson. Hmm.. She plays as Penny Lane, which was such a brilliant name to pick first of all. Ya, of course. She was brilliant in this film; playing the rebellious, drug-addict, beautiful girl - Penny Lane. I actually really liked her performance in this movie, she was amazing in the movie, but not in other movies. This is the only good Kate Hudson film everyone.\n\nThe star of the film is none other than Billy Crudup, who plays as Russell Hammond, a man based on Glenn Frey who reminds me a little bit of John Bonham and George Harrison. He was a rock star, drug user, loves groupies, say and do all kinds of crazy stuff. Billy Crudup did a marvelous job with the role of Russell Hammond, I liked his performance. In fact, I think I might have as well been a Stillwater fan from this movie because of Crudup's performance.\n\nIn conclusion, I think Almost Famous is a heartfelt, warm, lovely, sweet and also a rebellious, coming-of-age, crazy film that depicts the life of the 1970s.",
