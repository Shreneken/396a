    "summary": "Recently released from prison, Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden) concocts a plan to steal $1 million in jewels. Dix gathers a team of small-time crooks, including a safecracker (Anthony Caruso) and a lawyer (Louis Calhern), and the heist is a success until a stray bullet kills one of the men. As they scramble to pick up the pieces after the theft, the men let their greed get the best of them while entangling themselves in webs of deceit, treachery and murder.",

That puts a lot of pressure on factors other than the ending the to keep the viewer interested.  Huston's direction is superb and the acting is good enough.  However, I didn't see anything especially innovative about the heist and its aftermath to recommend this one.",

I particularly enjoyed the street scenes in what was apparently Cincinatti, although the outdoor urban scenes were way too few for my taste. \n\nThe characters were interesting, too. I liked the relationship between the rich guy and his wife and the way he would honor her desire to play cards since that was pretty much the only entertainment she had. I also liked the scene in the diner where the cook angrily throws out an obnoxious customer who claims to run over cats in his car whenever he can.",

In an unexpectedly quiet and unobtrusive way, the film achieves greatness by offering itself up as crime drama only as a measure of probing deeper, more thought-provoking themes. We expect the kind of intense, high-spirited action generally characteristic of the genre, but \"The Asphalt Jungle\" instead functions as a somber and pensive exploration of human vices and dreams, creating a web of yearning that almost fatalistically entraps any and all who dare to lose themselves among its sticky threads. An undercurrent of absurdist humor breathes life into a work that might otherwise seem morbid or self-important, and the thoughtful viewer is inevitably left pondering the mystery and unique charm of this most intriguing work by John Huston.",

            "content": "Hard boiled film noir at its best.\n\nJohn Huston's crime drama The Asphalt Jungle (1950) is fascinating as a character study of numerous criminals pulling off a jewelry heist. Huston keeps you in the moment worrying about whether a cop will appear to shake someone down or if something will go wrong. In a world with corrupt cops, greedy elites, desperate men, helpless women, and double crosses all over, The Asphalt Jungle is a brutal environment to reside in all its moody atmosphere. Writers John Huston, Ben Maddow, and W.R. Burnett is all about the nihilism of the crime world. The job doesn't matter as it's all about how ruthless and unforgiving criminals can be when a big payday is involved.\n\nHarold Rosson's cinematography captures nighttime heists and perilous journeys into the dark of the Midwest cityscape. George Boemler's editing is steady and kept me engaged within each moment of this mysterious film noir for 112 minutes. Mikklos Rozsa's score is excellent with a boisterous style adding to Rosson's bold noir aesthetic. \n\nSterling Hayden is a deep voiced and hard edged hooligan or a violent heavy for the gang named Dix Handley. You like Hayden's tough guy act with his dreams of getting back his family farm and horses as he tries to get a quick buck. Jean Hagen is sweet and fun as Doll Conovan, who is hopelessly in love with Hayden. \n\nFurthermore, Louis Calhern is the ruthless and greedy wealthy financial backer Emmerich. He's great at portraying nonchalant and remorseless. James Whitmore is cool and calm as the rough diner owner and getaway driver with a penchant for feeding cats. Sam Jaffe is incredible as the intellectual Doc Erwin R. with his heavy German accent and pleasant manner. I loved his whimsical love of younger women and zeal for robbery.\n\nJohn McIntire is excellent as the gung ho Police Commissioner Hardy who makes all the excuses we've heard before for Barry Kelley's corrupt Lieutenant Ditrich. Marc Lawrence's cowardly Cobby and money dealer is super entertaining to watch squirm under pressure. Anthony Caruso is fun as the safe cracker or boxman named Louis Ciavelli. Teresa Celli is wonderful as Caruso's very Italian wife Maria Ciavelli. \n\nMarilyn Monroe makes her cute debut with like a single minute of screen time as Angela Phinlay. She's beautiful and fun as Emmerich's side girl with her own plans. You feel bad for her as Angela has no agency. If you want to watch The Asphalt Jungle just for Marilyn Monroe, then don't as she's barely involved. But she is lovely as ever in the midst of a fantastic film noir.\n\nIn conclusion, The Asphalt Jungle is one of John Huston's most riveting and intriguing pictures with phenomenal acting all around. It's cool and dark with that bleak Huston style.",

            "content": "Sam Jaffe is an odd choice for a crook, but he plays a German guy in a German town, so maybe it makes sense. The way Dix treats Doll is painful to watch, not a critique but a warning. The safecracking isn't the one in Rififi, but that's the script and no deal. Sterling Hayden is Sterling Hayden. There are some continuity issues with cuts.\n\nBut all the performances are excellent. It's hard to pick out a few, but I'd mention Louis Calhern, James Whitmore, Marc Lawrence, and Brad Dexter in his small role. Noirs are often set in NY or LA, so it's nice to see another city with a different profile.\n\nI can't give it 5 stars because of the howling error after the safecracker breaks through the wall and there's the indented stairwell to the left, after seeing a clear passage just before. And a less serious one but still, when Gus turns the music up at the start when Dix walks in, he turns the dial down, as he does again after the cops leave when he actually turns it down.",

            "content": "Marilyn Monroe is in The Asphalt Jungle about as much as the actual Maltese Falcon is in the 1941 film of the same name, (which oddly enough were both directed by the same man, John Huston) but her later fame has led this film to be rebranded as some sort of triumphant arrival on the scene instead of her first role substantial enough to warrant a credit. As a heist noir, the film is decent but far from pulse-pounding for most of the runtime and is particularly weak in establishing and maintaining some of its characters (the film lacks a central figure to orient around and instead focuses on the larger group) even though it is supposed to be heavily character-driven; Calhern's Emmerich is meant to be complex but comes off as inconsistent, at times effortlessly suave in the face of tangible danger but then reduced to a stuttering wreck at the thought of a double-cross. I am really not a fan of Hayden in this role, he plays like a caricature of the prototypical tough hood in classic Hollywood, even considering his humanist final conclusion. But it's not all rough-and-tumble; Jaffe's mastermind 'Doc', wielding a heavy Teutonic accent, is a competent and composed mentor figure, and his final scene paying forward a jukebox run, getting lost in the moment before being collared as a result of his nostalgic benevolence, is one of the highlights of the production. There are moments when the film seems solid and can create suspense or emotional involvement (there are some interesting close-proximity shots that are well-integrated, and notable neorealist elements as well), but for the large segments this can't help but feel like it's a bit lackluster and iffy for Huston, where the high points end up highlighting the flaws.

        {
            "content": "Directed by John Huston, this noir heist film is strong and well-balanced.  The main characters in the caper are well-developed - the brain, an older German-American guy who has just gotten out of prison (Sam Jaffe), the safecracker with a wife and little baby (Anthony Caruso), the driver, a hunchbacked diner owner (James Whitmore), and the southern-fried muscleman (Sterling Hayden).   They are brought together by a bookie (Marc Lawrence), and plan to fence the jewels they steal to a rich lawyer (Louis Calhern).\n\nTo describe what happens would be to spoil the film, but suffice to say that even the best laid plans are fraught with peril, and unexpected events.  I appreciated how Huston spent the time developing the characters and kept the story tight, without resorting to excess violence or plot twists.  You still get the usual sorts of things - snappy dialogue, tense standoffs, double-crosses, etc - but it all feels intelligent.  There are extended periods in the film without any background music, which I found refreshing.  Each scene contributes to the story, and there is a spare feeling to the visuals, both of which make it feel authentic.\n\nThere is also a human element in the relationship Caruso has with his wife (Teresa Celli), and in Whitmore standing up to comments about his deformity.  It's a small moment in the movie, but it's quietly powerful when he says with dignity, \"What I carry on my back, I was born with it.  I didn't grow it myself.\"  Also humanizing are the separate dreams Jaffe and Hayden have of running away from it all afterwards (Jaffe to Mexico to be in the warm weather and 'young girls', ok, ugh; Hayden to re-purchase his family farm in Kentucky).  Everyone has a weakness, a flaw, but at the same time, a positive attribute.  Jaffe is smart and a gentleman criminal, but he's also a pervert.  Hayden is tough and the opposite of greedy, but he's also a compulsive gambler (and loser) at the horse races.\n\nHuston also shows us bad police behavior - pushing a witness to make a false ID, accepting a payoff from the bookie, and using their muscle when under pressure to make arrests.  I loved how this was balanced by a little segment with the police radio from the commissioner (John McIntire), who flicks the calls of distress on one by one, and then points out: \"People are being cheated, robbed, murdered, raped.  And that goes on 24 hours a day, every day in the year.  And that's not exceptional, that's usual.  It's the same in every city of the modern world.  But suppose we had no police force, good or bad.  Suppose we had...just silence.  Nobody to listen. Nobody to answer.  The battle's finished.  The jungle wins.  The predatory beasts take over.  Think about it.\"\n\nAs a side bonus to all of this, you get Marilyn Monroe in a small role as Calhern's mistress.  She was just 24, and this film, along with \"All About Eve\" from the same year, were the ones that started generating serious attention for her.  Her performance is uneven at best, but when she turns on the charm with Calhern, or asks one of the cops \"Do I have to talk to him? Couldn't I just talk to you?\", her face so naturally assuming the look of a little girl, she's electric.\n\nThere's also a wonderful dance sequence from a young girl (Helene Stanley) in a diner, who cuts loose in a very charming way after given a bunch of change for the jukebox.  What a fun moment that is, maybe my favorite in the entire film, and how it fit into the plot and Jaffe's proclivities is very clever.  \n\nMy only small criticism is with Sterling Hayden, who got top billing, but just didn't resonate with me.  I think it was something about the way he spoke, which seemed too 'heavy', if that makes any sense.  Jean Hagen as his girlfriend was just average too.  Calhern is brilliant as the shady lawyer, and the rest of the cast turn in solid performances.  I considered a slightly higher rating, since you can so clearly see the effect this film had on others which would follow (Rififi from 1955 comes immediately to mind).  Solid film.",

More than a film noir film about a jewel heist, this movie is about how random chance is unpredictable and it's generally something you have no control over. We may have everything planned to the letter, but we can't stop chaos, no matter our preparations. The commissioner in the film makes a good point that even if we do have some crooked cops it would be awful if there were no cops, because then there would be no one to reach out to the cries for help that come in every minute to them. Dix is a very strange character, honor-bound yet ruthless, and rural bred yet he forces himself to live in the city until it's too late for him to be happy. One of the characters mentioned that crime is just the left side of human endeavors, but really when it comes down to it, honest work will bring you more happiness than any ill-gotten gain ever could.

One of the most important aspects of this film was how it helped redefined the technical tools available to the advanced filmmaker. At least since the thirties, one of the perennial favorite types of movies in America has been the crime thriller. There were several examples where the protagonist, the anti-hero as it were, concentrated on the criminal. The usual point of view taken by these stories provided the point of view held by the authorities. 'The Asphalt' drew the audience behind the eyes watching the events on old from their perspective. This groundbreaking technique would influence generations of filmmakers including such luminaries as Sam Peckinpah and Quentin Tarantino and others that formed a coterie of filmmakers devoted to depicting violence in exceptionally graphic reality. Considering the movie was produced during a time when government and religious groups enforced various codes restricting the content of movies. Such things as 'The Hayes Code' weren't 'officially' in place to impose censorship but their hold over the industry was sufficiently intense to be effective.\n\nErwin \"Doc\" Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe) just released from prison after serving seven years of his sentence. Doc's well-earned reputation in criminal circles was a mastermind, a person who is capable of the most intricately involved plans to help ensure the success of any criminal enterprise. Directly after regaining his freedom Doc's first order of business was to visit a bookie, Cobby (Marc Lawrence), who resides somewhere in a Midwest City presumed by many to be Cincinnati. The touches such as leaving out the precise location allow us a story to assume a ubiquitous nature allowing the events to unfold as if they occurred in almost any city in America. The purpose of the visit is to have a low-level criminal introduce Doc to a high profile lawyer, Alonzo Emmerich (Louis Calhern), to kick a much more elaborate and lucrative plan. Emmerich listening with undivided attention as the recently released convict begins to lay out some of the details of his plan. Doc has a scheme that will yield a score of over $1 million in precious gems and jewelry. To execute this plan, you need to state a $50,000 to secure the services of several experts; a safecracker/box man, a driver any third party described as a hooligan. If the listening to these details Emmerich agrees to bankroll the operation with one prerequisite, you'll be the one to dispose of the turning the stones into money, not one of the many fences would perform this task. One example of the genius that made Mr. Huston's influential and innovative filmmakers in history was how he treated the planning stage for the heist. The scene of this type would normally be just a brief moment of exposition sole purpose is to provide the audience with the broad brushstrokes what is about to happen. In the hands of a master craftsman such as Mr. Houston, it takes on a much deeper meaning.\n\nFirst, however, the team had to be assembled. The first one Doc hires are the 'box man,' professional, safe cracker Louie Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso). We then help doc obtain the services of the getaway driver, Gus Minissi (James Whitmore), the personification of a man with twisted intention physically made manifest by being a hunchback. Finally, the last member of the gang is brought in, the hooligan and all around tough guy ideal to handle unexpected situations that might arise. This position is assumed by, Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden), the general thug with numerous criminal associations. Only after the entire team has been assembled the stock gathers them around to relate the details of his plan. This is one of many spots in the film what happens it defies the expectations of the audience. Traditional brief overview of the crime replaced with a finely detailed account of the actual plan. The scene takes over 11 minutes of time during which Doc proves his credentials for the title of Mastermind. He covers the details of the crime's execution in minute detail. This is how Mr. Houston allows his screenplay to soar above the mundane storytelling of the most film. By supplying such details, the audience receives a much clearer understanding of Doc's contribution to the crime. Audience members might understandably expect the scene to progress as we have witnessed so many times; \"we enter the building gaining access to the safe. The safe cracker bypasses the locks and opens the safe. We emptied the content and leave, the speeding array in the car provided by the driver. To handle any unforeseen circumstances that might arise, the hooligan stands ready to strong arm theoretically of the problem.\n\nBy going into such extraordinary detail into the planning stage of the crime, the audience receives a greater understanding of the depth of strategy and the importance of tactics and pulling off a major heist. Doc takes on the persona of a general as seen in almost any World War II as he briefs his senior officers before a major operation. One of the many subliminal themes brought out by the story is the universal nature of being so well-prepared for any inherently dangerous activity. This is one of the most fundamental somatic aspects of a film noir movie. The sense of moral ambiguity is achieved by demonstrating that the criminals utilize most of the pre-operation planning that the military and civil authorities employ on a routine basis. A considerable portion of the film's brilliance is how the moral ambiguity that is part of the very definition of film noir's depiction in such a realistic setting with unprecedented attention to the minutest details. Many stories have been the about the term 'mastermind' improperly utilizing the term or underestimating its overall importance progression of character development.\n\nThis is one of a fascinating crime I have ever seen in the event the seeing it many times over the years I'm still able to find something fresh and different each time experience the movie. This is not something that you watch casually, looking up to catch glimpses while busy with something else. The film demands and deserves your full attention. Every individual frame is essential to the overall crafting of the movie is necessary to relate the story at hand completely. This advice will not be difficult to act upon; the perfection of the film's artistry is inspiring. As always this presentation as part of the Criterion Collection Blu-ray release schedule, the movie can finally be seen and fully appreciated a technical environment that exceeds anything the grandest theater from sixty years ago could boost. For those that own a home theater receiver capable of emulating some different audio environments try either the mono theater of a moderately large venue. I found that the best way to listen to this movie is to enhance the natural reverberation found in those great palaces of cinematic entertainment.\nbullet\tAudio Commentary From 2004 by Film Historian Drew Casper, Featuring Archival Recordings of Actor James Whitmore.\nbullet\tPlanes of Chaos, A 1983 Documentary About Actor Sterling Hayden\nbullet\tNew Interviews with Film Noir Historian Eddie Muller and Cinematographer John Bailey\nbullet\tArchival Footage of Writer-Director John Huston Discussing the Film.\nbullet\tEpisodes of the Television Program City Limits From 1979 Featuring Huston\nbullet\tAudio Excerpts of and Archival Interview with Huston\nbullet\tTrailer\nbullet\tPlus: Essay by Critic Geoffrey O'Brien",

One of my biggest complaints is that this movie takes WAY too long to get us to the robbery. In fact, I must confess that I fell asleep the first 3 times I tried starting The Asphalt Jungle. I've been spoiled by modern heist movies (like Ocean's Eleven,) and so I've grown accustomed to a much more interesting method of organizing the team and preparing for the job. Here it was a lot of talking, and very little of that conversation was good for character development or even setting up the crime. However the movie turns on a dime once the heist happens. The actual robbery itself isn't all that complex, and most modern movie-goers would call it downright dull, but the fallout from that crime is what makes the movie worth watching. I know, based on the Hollywood code of the time, that no one was getting away with the crime but watching the slow downfall of the team is extremely interesting. It's great to see how the different vices of the characters play a part in their demise. I enjoyed most of the acting performances, and it was fun to see some familiar faces early in their careers. I don't think I'll ever seek out The Asphalt Jungle again, but I did appreciate what it did in that second half, and I am happy that it laid the groundwork that made some of our modern heist films a reality.",

Doc has a plan for a jewlery heist that involves a driver, a safecracker and a hooligan. After reaching an agrement with the lawyer, Emmerich, Doc uses his bookie to find the men for the job.

This alerts the police, and when Dix punches a security cop, he drops the gun and shoots the safecracker in the gut as they are leaving. Now they police are after them, but things are still going okay. Emmerich the attorney has hired an private detective to collect on his debts because he too, like Dix, is flat broke.

Sterling Hayden, the first-billed star of the film, equivocally the leading man among the motley crew, is not the brain, but a trustworthy hooligan, suitably amplifying his simplistic kindheartedness by exposing himself to his girl friend (the moderately-used Jean Hagen) of his stroke of bad luck and his humble-but-never-realized dream (which Huston cleverly opts as the heart-rending culmination) under the veneer of his stalwart physique.\n\nSam Jaffe, who acquired his one and only Oscar nomination (the film altogether got 4 nominations including a BEST DIRECTOR for Huston) for the role of Doc, the constantly behind-the-wall mastermind, has another sort of fatalistic empathy through his non-violent, genteel policy which is simply the otherness for a perpetrator, he is a born leader, who welds a collection of gifted offenders into a real team, the only thing he misses it luck. Louis Calhern, the paymaster and the fence, ostensibly well-off, but bankrupted, is the major mis-step of the heist, Calhernâ(TM)s commonly understated performance finds the right place as he is juggling between his wife and his trophy mistress (a 24-year-old Monroe, whose striking sheen cannot be overlooked even in such a minor role). \n\nThe film is feasibly an agitprop of police department, although the coppers are neither over-beautified nor disparaging represented (unlike the present mockery trend), it emits a pertinent point-of-view of their functions and liabilities, Huston is the torchbearer of the American neorealism, and I hope this assertion can stand its ground.",

Like, \"Beat the Devil\" and \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,\" it is not great, but moderately well made. Maybe the most compelling sequence is where Erwin \"Doc\" Riedenschneider, the mastermind behind robbery, is enchanted by a young girl, while he is trying to escape with a taxi driver. I also admired the performance of Louis Calhern, who recites the best quote of the film: \"After all, crime is only... a left-handed form of human endeavor.\" Sterling Hayden is his usual self; however he does not always fair well as a man possessed with (Tarkovsky's?) nostalgia. I don't think he was ever that kind actor; being able to display dense emotions genuinely, nevertheless he was affective to a certain extent. So, \"The Asphalt Jungle\" is a good noir.

The only really important part was when Emmerich talks about what he's going to do since he's in debt. Some of it was interesting, but it was boring at times. The depiction of the actual heist was well done, as it was enjoyable and had some tense moments, and the movie just got better from there for many reasons. The acting isn't great, with a few exceptions; Sterling Hayden, as he did in The Killing and Dr. Strangelove, plays the same character. I thought the guy who played Cobby wasn't that good. I thought Sam Jaffe did a good job at playing the Doc (even though in the beginning his accent got a little too heavy at times), James Whitmore did good, and honestly, I don't get the big deal about Marilyn Monroe in this movie. Yeah, this was one of her first big movies, but she wasn't in it very much, and even when she was her acting wasn't great. Although I did think she did a pretty good job during the testifying scene, if she was anyone else, I wouldn't have paid much attention to her. That part was good acting, but not great. She had some growing up to do. The ending was alright. I'll give the film credit for making the audience care about the criminals getting away with it, but then you get mixed up because you end up wanting the police to catch them, but at the same time you still want the criminals to get away with it, so props to this film for that.

            "content": "I have never heard of \"The Asphalt Jungle\" before. The title intrigued me and had me asking - will I be treated to a dark rocky story reeking of burnt rubber? Amazingly, the movie somehow lives up to its name. The 1950 black and white film is set on an unnamed Midwest city - smoggy and foreboding. The streets might be lifeless and dull, but you sense the bustling of lawbreakers on the hidden corners.\n\nThe movie follows a heist - from the meticulous planning to the erroneous aftermath. Just got out of prison, Doc Riedenschneider, a small man with a heavy German accent, has a \"foolproof\" plan in stealing some jewels. But his plan won't come into fruition without funding and abled bodied men with certain skills. But of course, adding humans to the equation does not make that plan foolproof anymore. Honor among thieves? Pssh, not in this story, bud.\n\nWhat I loved about \"The Asphalt Jungle\" is that it is a great ensemble movie. Today, we're spoiled with character actors, but back then, Hollywood was about its stars. There is no real lead actor in the film. The talented cast is in service of the story. There are a couple of good performances. I liked Sam Jaffe as the German mastermind and Loius Calhem as the double-crossing Emmerich. But perhaps my favorite is Marilyn Monroe. She is in a very minor role, but damn, she is the paragon of a scene stealer.\n\nPerhaps the star of the film is the man behind the camera. Director John Huston composes a textured film, with characters caught up in their own flaws. I also like the way he frames his shots and paints a visual play of shadows (a film noir signature). I also liked its nitty-gritty story - where not one character is portrayed in good light. I just find these kind of tales so robust and fascinating. (I recommend Dashiell Hammett's lean novel Red Harvest, which I devoured last year). \"The Asphalt Jungle\" is a great movie. It's rough on the surface, but lays out one smooth ride. This caper is a keeper.",

Sam Jaffe is cool-headed and convincing as the brains behind the operation, while a ragtag cast of backup anti-heroes pay the price as the whole thing slowly starts to unravel. A young Marilyn Monroe makes several scant appearances as nothing more than eye candy, still so green she can barely keep from looking straight into the cameras. It's noteworthy that very few characters are as black and white as the film stock, a trademark of the genre, even if their motivations are ultimately sinister and selfish. A worthwhile slant on the heist picture that's crammed full of smoke and atmosphere, it expertly balances several different faces and pays off each story, most with especially dark consequences. Quite good, but not great, it creates some new conventions while bowing to many others.",

The narratives are comparatively slow and and often perceived as dull while the technical work is seemingly so far behind that which dazzles us today that the films look prehistoric.  Yet many of these films are considered classic for good reason; the narratives hold up over time, the stars of such features have become embedded within our collective consciences and these films tend to foreshadow our contemporary society.  The Asphalt Jungle (John Huston, MGM,1950) is no exception to any of this.  The narrative is drudgingly slow at times, the claustrophobic use of light and shadow serves to trap the viewer and the complete void of star power emphasizes just how important the star system is to films.  Take the film in the context of a viewer from 1950 and this film becomes a revelation!\n\nBy 1950 film styles had already started undergoing major changes and The Asphalt Jungle reflects many of these changes.  Throughout the film there is extensive use of location shooting, using the city streets and old dilapidated buildings of our urban world as ready made sets, emphasizing urban decay along with our own eroding morality.  This lends the film an incredible realism as compared to films released prior to 1950.  Also noticeable is the way in which the camera is employed.  Tilted angles, extreme high and low shots, imperceptible lighting all add to the dreariness portrayed in a decaying urban society.  The cinematography for the film is incredible.  The film is constantly bathed in darkness, adding a shadowy layer to the film, giving the city a life of its own.  At times there is no light whatsoever, and it isn't until the final scene of the film that we see a screen saturated with light.  This endless darkness further ensconces the audience within the city and helps to reinforce the themes the script focuses on.\n\nThe array of themes and issues dealt with in the script are endless, themes facing urban society in the late 1940's as well as contemporary society.  Human fallibility, a rising and unfettered criminal faction, greed and corruption, a burgeoning urban decay coupled with a declining morality are all some of the issues or themes touched on by the film.  It's a credit to the adaptation by John Huston and Ben Maddow that they were able to pack so much into their script.\n\nWith a professional ensemble cast that serves the film quite well (the use of no stars emphasizes the anonymity of life in the city) it is a minor role which stands out within this film.  Marilyn Monroe gets her first taste of the silver screen in a minor role but every second she is on the screen is electric.  All she was to become as an actress and pop culture icon is on display in this film.  The sultry vixen, the coquettish young girl pouting her way into what she wants, the bombshell to be just waiting to emerge from her cocoon.  Two things stand out to me particularly in regards to Marilyn here (please note that I actually studied Marilyn for a semester while at USC so I have more knowledge than most regarding this icon).  Her very first scene involves her sitting in her \"uncle's\" lap (Alonzo Emmerich played by Louis Calhern) as he pulls her in for a kiss.  Marilyn owed her career to a long string of such affairs and it is ironic that her first appearance on screen is her showing what got her there in the first place.  The second thing that got my attention is her body.  In this film she completely has the ideal 1940's body for a woman.  Her body changed drastically over the next decade as she became the feminine ideal of the 1950's and it is striking just how much change that body underwent.  It's almost as if she was two completely different woman.\n\nI know this isn't everyone's cup of tea but the film is worth just to see Marilyn at such a young age, before fame wrecked her.  Tell me, isn't she stunningly beautiful in the film?  Google still images and write a comment.  Thanks for reading and sharing!",

I recognize the 1950s as \"The Fool's Golden Era of Film.\"  This might be the best movie to come out of that decade, but what is it compared to anything Chaplin released decades earlier or anything Kubrick released decades later?",

The film actually moves at a quick pace and at times I felt it was hard to keep up with all the characters being introduced. However, once all the characters are introduced everything becomes clear and the film saves itself from being a total waste of time.

Indeed, it is those human frailties (which may not be unique to the criminal class) that sow the seeds of destruction.  We follow Sterling Hayden from start to finish, as he escapes from the law after another in a string of petty knockovers, meeting up with mastermind Sam Jaffe and financial backers bookie Marc Lawrence and lawyer Louis Calhern, then the job itself and its aftermath.  Hayden just wants to get some dough to go back to his old Kentucky home where his folks raised racehorses (but he keeps blowing it all at the track).  He doesn't seem to notice that clip joint girl Jean Hagen loves him, but she keeps hanging around.  It turns out that Calhern is broke and keen to doublecross the gang by taking the jewels and fleeing to Mexico.  He's got an apartment set up for mistress Marilyn Monroe while his ill wife pines away for his company.  Calhern is the biggest heel in the picture, although things really unravel due to the unfortunate but pragmatic relationship between one of the gang and a corrupt cop being squeezed by the police commissioner.  The commissioner himself gets the final word, telling us that the cops are the only thing standing between ordinary people and the predators of the (asphalt) jungle.  In the end, I didn't have that sense of existential collapse that you find in Rififi or the works of Jean-Pierre Melville, the bittersweet feeling of predictable loss; instead we get a more matter-of-fact rendering that nevertheless is revealing in its portrayal of the human condition.",

This is a rare look into the lives of many charismatic individuals. What unveils is possibly Huston's best work.\n\nA jewelry heist is formulated and sprung into action by  an eccentric ex-con played by Sam Jaffe and among others ensnared in the mix is the ever dominating Sterling Hayden. Although he shares the spotlight with Jaffe and Louis Calhern, he shines as bright as ever. Hayden went on to start the crucial chain of events that we saw unfold in Dr. Strangelove and he also gave potent performances in such classics as The Godfather and The Killing. He is a giant leading actor and therefore dominating the screen seems to come easy for the actor. Many of his scenes are him showing his strength but also confessing his depth (he speaks of retiring to his deceased father's land, full of horses and mainly peace). \n\nThe story is expertly led by Huston in the director's seat and it packs a punch that not only leaves a mark but it is also strategically placed. This is not a shoot 'em up crime thriller, it has a brain and offers a distinct human side to crime noir. I absolutely love the final closing scenes, they really captivate the art of the time and the brilliance of the entire film concept. The creativity, overall details, and  especially the final frames make this a landmark film. It is not a moment too soon, it feels right on time as it paces towards the finish line. 5/5\n\n***Updated after 2nd viewing on 8/29/12***",

            "content": "Huston's 1950 Noir about a jewel heist is an incredibly captivating film. Normally when I hear a film described as being about a heist, my mind immediately turns to the myriad examples of bad films centered around a them. For example: Entrapment, The Heist, The Score, Soul Plane \nHowever, much like he in the Treasure of the Sierra Madre, he creates fully realized characters that allow this film to soar high above it's heist film cohorts. \n\nThe film centers around a million dollar jewel heist. Sam Jaffe plays Doc Erwin, a criminal mastermind who has been released from prison and is planning another big score. Through a local bookie, he pulls together a group of criminals to get the job done. While the above could summarize many different films, I assure you there is nothing like The Asphalt Jungle. \n\nThe film utilizes the POV of the criminals to tell the story. Yet, unlike Reservoir Dogs which some people have equated this film with, this isn't just an hour and a half full of slick dialogue. While they may partake in criminal activities, Huston gives us the people behind the criminal actions. A fantastic Sterling Hayden desires to get money not so he can fund more criminal endeavors, he wants to buy back his families farm that he lost in the Great Depression. The safe cracker Louis wants to support his wife and his kids. Huston does an incredible job of letting the viewer empathize with these characters by letting us see their lives away from planning and executing the job. Huston shows the audience that crime isn't always driven by malice, crime is sometimes just a part of life. Louis Calhern sums this notion up best in the film when he states: \"After all, crime is only... a left-handed form of human endeavor...\"\nWhile Huston doesn't vilify the criminals, he doesn't deify the cops either. For the most part they are crooked and although they exclaim that they do not want to let the \"beasts rule the jungle\", they often stand shoulder to shoulder with the brutes. \n\nIt is a simply marvelous & thought-provoking film. If Huston keeps this up he will keep moving up on my list of astounding directors.",

It doesn't have the grace that comes with the aging and airing-out of an idea, so it stands more as a distinguished landmark along the road to better noir and modern crime film than a best-example of these genres. For fans of these type pleasures though, its an absolute must see part of having the full perspective, and a refreshing take for those grown weary of a drink that's begun to taste watered down over the years. Have better crime films been made since this films release? Well of course. But are more than a small handful of them in the same discussion as this film in considering 'most classic ever'? Not at all. This was something special.\n\nSo much attention to detail. So much dedication to itself without beholding to anything else. Unrelentingly tough and doesn't even think of pulling any punches. As its unfolding it validates itself more and more with each scene.

Master direction by Huston, with brilliant supporting performances by Sterling Hayden as the tough, old school gunman, James Whitmore as the hunchback getaway driver, Anthony Caruso as the expert safe-cracker, Brad Dexter as Emmerich's seedy henchman, and Marilyn Monroe as Emmerich's young smoking hot squeeze.

I'm not a huge fan of John Huston, this being the first film I've \"connected to\" in certain way. Forget \"The Treasure of Serra Madre\" or \"The Maltese Falcon\", \"The Asphalt Jungle\" had a certain amount of pressure riding on you through-out the entire running time. Maybe it's because of the threads that pop up, pieces of the characters that are mentioned, or even the history of how certain stories started that are left in the dark that give this film real substance. \n\nFrom the beginning you understand that the story has to be about a failed attempt at a robbery yet to happen. Even if you've read the synopsis, every character is working on a different level, though they're all working on the same job. The character interactions were far less melodramatic than one would think; even though there's a fair share of that particular quality one expects in a film-noir. \n\nAs I said above, I'm not really a fan of John Huston, but he does seem to have an advanced knowledge of film growth; whether it be directing, acting, photography, writing. Watching one of his films I can't help but think he had to tone down his directing method by maybe 15 years. Does that make sense? He seems to have an edgier quality that wasn't going to be widely accepted by the movie-going population, so he maybe took it back and even 'dumbed' down some of the characters and stories for people to understand that they were just watching a movie. There's a difference between real life and movies, no doubt. But back in the day, there was even a greater amount of separation between the movies and real life. I know little about John Huston and his directing method, but it's something I think about everytime I see one of his films. \n\nOf all the great things I have to say about this film, there were still traditional heist trappings. That could be because I've seen so many of these type of films that were made after 1950, that finally when I got to this one, nothing was as truly surprising as it should have been. There's only so many ways you can go with a heist film. There are different kinds of stories in this genre though, but this one isn't about the risky job, or planning, this is about the characters and how they function before and after the job. The actual robbery itself lasted about 5 minutes; which really surprised me. I have to say though that the 30 minute robbery scene in \"Rififi\" was so full of suspense that I could hardly stand it. \"The Asphalt Jungle\" digs out a different kind of suspense, something that's more in touch with emotion and down to earth, something that is a little more relatable. And that's why it was so exciting to watch.",

He was simply not right for this role, and the film really could have benefited from Huston regular Humphrey Bogart, or even someone like Cagney.

A group of people head down that tempting road of easy money, the big payday, and seal their fates against the most powerful gang in the city: the police.  Doc (Jaffe) gets out of prison and goes right back to what he's best at: big heists.  He plays the most interesting and layered character of the film and also comes through with fine acting.  Doc is a foreigner (German) and goes about his business with a discrete professionalism.  Dix (Hayden) has amazing presence and all that jazz, but his portrayal of the 'hooligan' in this pic is one dimensional and off key.  He goes through the whole movie with a look on his face like something smells funny.  By the end he becomes the main character by default, and it is the most likable because he's an honorable man who happens to be a thief. There is a bookie, a corrupt lawyer, a corrupt cop, and a couple others to round out the group.  Huston succeeds in making them all seem human and vulnerable each in their own way.  There are no angels and no demons, but people whose individual plights are made understandable.\r\n\r\nThis is the type of story that I am not drawn to only because you know how it will end.

After all I think we all secretly want to plan an immaculate bank job and have a stash of diamonds or a suitcase of bills about.

Funded by crooked attorney Emmerich (Louis Calhern), Riedenschneider recruits three men for the job, among them is Louis (Anthony Caruso) a professional at cracking safes; Gus (James Whitmore) a hunchbacked bartender as the getaway driver; and Dix (Sterling Hayden) as a strong-arm man to help with the caper. Dix is an impoverished hood who sees the caper as a means to finance his dream of owning a horse farm. Also a bookie named Cobby (Marc Lawrence) acts as Emmerich's go-between. The heist is pulled off successfully, but an alert night watchman shoots Louis. Angry that the bookie didn't let him in on the caper, a corrupt cop (Barry Kelley) beats the bookie into becoming a fink, confessing and fingering the other criminals involved. From here, the painstakingly planned crime falls apart quickly with each member of the gang proving to have his own fatal weakness and each contributing to his own downfall.\n\nLike John Huston's directorial debut, The Maltese Falcon (1941), inventing the film noir genre, he invents the caper/heist genre with The Asphalt Jungle. Much imitated, unlike the many films made after this one, it is less concerned with the plan or the brilliant heist. Instead it is more character driven, exploring deception, relationships and human weaknesses. Like The Maltese Falcon before it, there isn't a whole lot of action in the film allowing the cast the opportunity to fully develop their characters. The cast credits read out like a whoâ(TM)s who of great, talented character actors like Sterling Hayden, Louis Calhern, Sam Jaffe (who got an Oscar nomination for playing the mastermind of the heist), and James Whitmore. Also worth mentioning, making her \"big break\" in the film is Marilyn Monroe in an excellent star-making bit performance as Emmerich's lusty \"niece\". Sheâ(TM)s only in the film for a few minutes total but as is evident of the movie poster, she sure made an impression on audiences. John Huston is at his best with his great direction and gets the most out of his cast and the script, he co-wrote with Ben Maddow. Beautifully shot in ominous black and white photography by Oscar nominated Harold Rosson. Influencing many subsequent films such as Jules Dassin's Rififi (1955), Stanley Kubrick's The Killing (1956) (also starring Sterling Hayden in a very similar role), Ocean's Eleven (1960) as well as Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992), The Asphalt Jungle is a classic of the caper film subgenre as well as the film noir genre. And considering it was one of the first films to be told [realistically] through the point of view of the criminals, one can see itâ(TM)s influence reach to gangster films like Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction. The Asphalt Jungle is an essential piece of cinema and comes highly recommended to movie fans that love crime films. 10/10",

Burnett (Little Caesar, High Sierra), itâs directed by John Huston (Maltese Falcon, Key Largo) and features a score by MiklÃ³s RÃ³zsa who would win 3 Oscars from 17 nominations for his film contributions. The film also has a great ensemble cast including; Sterling Hayden, Louis Calhern, Jean Hagen, James Whitmore, Sam Jaffe, Brad Dexter and Marilyn Monroe in one of her first roles. With a collaboration such as this, it hardly seems surprising that they made such an effective film, but there are many examples where such combinations did not succeed.\r\n\r\nHere we have a diverse group of men, coming together to commit a major heist with considerable planning and preparation to avoid any snags, but of course few such endeavors ever seem to go as planned, especially in movies. The planning is the responsibility of \"Doc\" Riedenschneider (Jaffe), who seems more like a professor than a man who has just been released from jail. The muscle is supplied by Dix (Hayden), a more complex man than appearances might suggest who has both dreams and problems of his own. The financing comes from a desperate and corrupt lawyer named Emmerich (Louis Calhern). We also have the hunchbacked driver Gus Minissi (Whitmore), as well as a safecracker and the groups go-between a bookie, all with stories of their own.\r\n\r\nIn a fairly limited role as Emmerichâs much younger other woman we have Marilyn, while Hagen plays the girl in Dixâs life who just happens to go by the name Doll. \r\n\r\nIt is the films atmosphere and style particularly, including but not limited to the cinematography and the score, that mark this film distinctly as Noir, and not just a run of the mill Noir but one of genreâs best examples.

Somebody in here--I'm not going to go searching through all the people to find out who it is--was in both.  There is violence.  They're both in glorious black and white.  And that's pretty much what they have in common.  While there are a lot of deaths and injuries in this one, none of them are inflicted by Jamie Farr with a flagpole.  So that's different, too.  Though, contrary to what Wikipedia seems to think, [i]Blackboard Jungle[/i] is not a documentary.  Which means neither of them are.  Then again, a lot of movies with nothing in common aren't documentaries.  Also, in [i]The Asphalt Jungle[/i], Sam Jaffe unironically refers to the jewel theft as a caper.  So that's fun.\r\n\r\nDix Handley (Sterling Hayden) and Doc Erwin Riedenschneider (Jaffe) have both just gotten out of prison.  Neither of them seem terribly suited to anything but a life of crime, though Dix says he's only trying to build up enough of a bankroll to buy back the old family farm in the bluegrass country.  They hook up with Alonzo D. Emmerich (Louis Calhern), who sets them up to steal all the jewels out of a safe in what I'm pretty sure is a bank.  Emmerich plans to \"hide\" the jewels for them until they can be sold off and then screw them over, running off with the jewels himself.  Things do not go as planned for anyone.  Oh, the robbery goes off okay, except for a couple of things.  One, the explosion involved in blowing the door off the main safe sets off alarms all up and down the block, bringing in cops a-plenty.  Two, in one of the [i]stupidest[/i] accidents of noir, they get interrupted on their way out by the night watchmen.  One of them slugs him, the watchman drops his gun, the gun goes off, and Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso) is hit by the stray bullet.  Thing go downhill from there.\r\n\r\nDix is really a tragic character.  It simply does not occur to him that he can't just take over the family farm through a life of crime.  Obviously, he cannot think that anyone would track him down, which is just silly.  Anyone who knows the slightest bit about his history would know exactly how much he wants to go back.  Even if they didn't, they couldn't think it improbable that he might return to his old stomping grounds.  If I did something horrible and was on the lam, it wouldn't be unreasonable to check out my mom's house.  True, Dix doesn't live there anymore, and his family hasn't in some time, but my mother's property isn't as big as the farm he's running off to.  I also do not have the same kind of long-term love for it.  And, of course, we weren't driven off.\r\n\r\nI also find Doc fascinating.  He's clearly a very intelligent man.  I think perhaps some of his trouble is that he's a foreigner, and a German especially, in a time that doesn't really trust them.  The film was made in 1950, a time when Germans were not held in the highest of regard, and Doc was in prison for some time.  He might well have been a German Jew at that.  It's entirely possible that the reason he turned to crime is that he coudln't do anything else when he got to the US.  Dix is a petty thug.  Doc is a clear-thinking, intelligent man trapped in an unfortunate situation, albeit pretty much of his own volition.  One does wonder what else could have been done with that clever mind, and I rather suppose he spends some of the movie thinking about it, too.\r\n\r\nI would not say this is such a great noir as all that.  Oh, it's not bad.  But someone's saying it's as great as [i]Double Indemnity[/i], one of the greatest noir of all time.  It just isn't.  It's not bad, again.  I just can't fathom it comparing with, oh, [i]The Maltese Falcon[/i].  Even [i]Double Indemnity[/i], come to that, which is an excellent film.  I can see why this is one of those films everyone's heard of.  It's an interesting film, anyway.  I'm glad I've seen it.  You'll notice I say that a lot, and it is quite often true.  A good thing, too; imagine how tedious all of this would be if I weren't so often glad to have seen movies.  But the best noir ever made?  I wouldn't even put it in the top twenty-five.",

            "content": "'The Asphalt Jungle' is a seminal piece of post-war (1950) social realism which harks back to some of the more cosy clichés of the pre-war era. It focuses on the commission of a crime: Doc (Sam Jaffe) is freshly released from prison, a dapper, intelligent, little old bloke, and the man with the plan to carry out an audacious jewel robbery - he needs a team, and he needs finance for the operation. We watch the criminal underworld at work as the plan falls into place, the team assembles, and they set about this major theft, intent on changing their lives.\n\nThis is the stuff that dreams are made of - that one, big payday which will change your life. Only the criminal underworld has no honour, and there are double-crosses to worry about, and while get-rich-quick is the objective, the participants all have their own psychological conflicts and contradictions.\n\nJohn Huston's film presents itself as a naturalistic, almost documentary account. He uses a linear, easy-to-follow narrative - no special effects, no flashbacks, just a simple storyline stripped to the basics. We follow the logic of Doc's plan, enter the lives of the players, understand their hopes and dreams, recognise their flaws. Shot in black and white, Huston employs a film noir style without pushing it to extremes - this is more grimy urban realism than noir. He creates an atmosphere of reality without it ever being truly authentic.\n\nThere are plenty of images of bleak, windswept, city streets - some anonymous urban sprawl of concrete and asphalt which contrasts with the dreams of all the participants. They want out, want sun, sea, rural tranquillity, somewhere they are not just rats in the race.\n\nSignificantly, there are no moral judgements made in the film. The financier of the scheme, Emmerich (Louis Calhern), is a corrupt lawyer with a sickly wife and an expensive mistress (Marilyn Monroe, making her debut). Dix (Sterling Hayden) is a big farm boy who simply wants enough money to get the family farm out of hock, and he has the muscle and gun to make sure nobody stands in his way. Doc (Jaffe received an Oscar nomination) is a nice little old bloke who surely deserves a quiet retirement because, after all, nobody's really going to get hurt in this caper?\n\nAnd the policemen, meanwhile, are evidently quite capable of either blatant corruption or instrumental evasion of the law - they'll happily take bribes, they're unselfconsciously brutal and not averse to planting evidence. The audience is left to decide who are the bad guys and who are the good.\n\nThere is, however, one major moral question suggested without ever being directly posed. This is 1950, and huge sections of the audience will have been caught up in the war effort, either in uniform, in the factories, or waiting for loved ones to return. While British films of this era can make disparaging allusions to the wartime profiteers and black market criminals, 'The Asphalt Jungle' is coy on the subject. Except that Huston makes clear that all the criminals - and probably all the policemen - evaded wartime service because they were in prison, on the run, or unfit for the military.\n\nSeen at the time as a gritty, 'hard-boiled' epic, it can appear a little coy by today's standards. Nevertheless, it presents an America stripped of glamour - Monroe's cameo role is the exception - a post-war society with no obvious direction or values, a city populated by people with obvious, materialistic concerns. This is a world in which the individual is alienated from society, a world where might is right, a world in which people can be allowed occasional acts of decency or humanity, but a world in which the individual is too flawed and too self-centred ever to be guided by moral principles.\n\nThe DVD offers acceptable picture quality - a bit aged and worn in places, a bit dated in others. The soundtrack, while mono, is crisp but unsophisticated. And there are some entertaining extras - a brief piece by Huston, a scholarly commentary, and cast reminiscences.\n\nAn entertaining film, a must-watch for students of the cinema or those fascinated by the crime genre, and a film which, though it will continue to date, has a gripping enough storyline to keep you engaged.",

The film's somewhat adaptive film noir styling is striking and suitable, if a bit heavy-handed at times.

There is even a point where I feel like I can comprehend what is just around the corner from what is being filmed.\n\nJaffe's Doc Riedenschneider becomes a very charming character, a German man with a great penchant for seeing right through people, as he organizes this job in a very professional and steady manner. Sterling Hayden, in his usual mediocrity, plays a hardened and unhappy thug from Kentucky with gambling trouble who sees the job as a way to bankroll his dream of buying back the horse farm that he lost in the Great Depression. A hunchbacked Italian diner owner is hired as the getaway driver, Anthony Caruso plays a professional safecracker and loyal family man, and Marc Lawrence plays a bookie functioning as the mediator.\n\nIn a taut 11-minute heist sequence, the criminals confidently carry out the heist in a patient and calm manner. Caruso climbs down into a manhole, pounds his way through a brick wall, climbs the basement stairs to the jewelry store, deactivates the door's alarm and lets in the other thieves, and then heads to the main safe. With care, he slides flat on his back under the electric-eye system, picks the gate's lock, drills holes into the safe's door, gingerly opens a corked bottle of nitroglycerin, and sets off a charge on the jewelry store safe. This is not all technical stuff, as the script is spiced up with some streetwise poetry, such as when they refer to the nitroglycerin as \"the soup.\" And it takes talent to build upon a heist the way The Asphalt Jungle does. As the crooks do all of this, it seems well-planned just as Doc's arrangement of the operation is impressive, really a clever way of building his character. But, though I won't give anything away, we realize despite the thieves' mindsets of desperation and instinct after the heist goes down that these are not wise or reasonable men, or at least that is not the state of mind in which they have operated recently.\n\nOn the whole, this well-made, hard-boiled crime flick is quite good, and every male character is fashioned well through the actors, script and direction. The females, however, are not granted the same justice. Jean Hagen is a silly token weakling woman for the male character with whom she is coupled to boss her around. And thus my gripe with John Huston. The Asphalt Jungle, yes, is about hardened male criminals, and it is a male bonding picture, neither of which are bad, but there's a difference between a film like The Godfather in which the women \"know their place\" in the depicted traditional hierarchy and film like The Asphalt Jungle in which the only female characters---Marilyn Monroe's blonde squeaky bimbo who one could say ultimately screws things up for one character, Jean Hagen's lapdog of a blindly loyal and submissive quasi-girlfriend of Sterling Hayden's and Teresa Celli, an Italian housewife who only begins to take guff from another male character---are subjugated only because the filmmakers have decided for them to be.\n\nThere is great instant camaraderie between Sam Jaffe's ideological German mastermind and Sterling Hayden's compulsive Kentucky roughneck. Again, terrific depiction of male bonding, but couldn't there have at least been some depth to the female stick figures squeezed in just for the patronizing reason that the macho realm of the story seems a little dry and insulated without them? The reasons I am blaming Huston for this and not the writers are because I have not read W.R. Burnett's original novel and because Huston, as the director and co- screenwriter, he had every ability to flesh out these wasted women. Nonetheless, The Asphalt Jungle is a decent and entertaining noir that set the standards that Jules Dassin's Rififi would totally shatter only five years later.",

Doc was easily my favorite character as the performance by Sam Jaffe gives the character an unmistakable sense of realism. Sterling Hayden, one of the more underrated actors of the time, gives a rock solid performance as the brawn behind the operation. The ONLY fault I can find is that for a film whose title refers to a city and the way that it can be a jungle it really lacked that kind of environmental sense it could have achieved to push the film over the edge.

The film does not give in to the tough bravado that film noir sometimes indulged in. It is an acute examination of human failing, and that is ultimately what makes the tone so bittersweet. This is epitomised by Sam Jaffe being caught because he dallied too long to watch a pretty young girl dancing. He knows he would have escaped had he left when he first intended, but you sense that he senses he would have made the same mistake anyway - if not in that bar with that girl, then with another. Likewsie Louis Calhern. The scene in which he forgives his weak-willed mistress as she is confessing to the police is beautifully and delicately played.

The heist scene is uninteresting and there is no attention paid to the details of the planning or execution. There is one clever element of suspense during the heist, but I won't spoil it.

[b]The Asphalt Jungle [/b]is very famous, directed by John Huston (\"Prizzi's Honor\"), nominated for four Oscars, but I couldn't get into it. It's very well done. The cinematography is gorgeous, but I just didn't care about any of the characters, or even the story really. Maybe because this is a heist film instead of a detective story. And I don't always enjoy a heist. But at least all of the women weren't evil. So that's a plus. But at the same time, there wasn't a femme fatale.\n\nI enjoyed [b]Kiss Me Deadly[/b] a bit more. Possibly because it was so strange. Detective Mike Hammer picks up a scantily clad female hitchhiker. She asks him to remember her if she doesn't make it. So when their car is overtaken, leaving her dead and him unconscious, he sets out to unravel the mystery. Though I can't say I really liked any of the characters in this film, either, I was at least intrigued by their stories. And the ending is very bizarre.\n\n[b]Akeelah and the Bee[/b] is a pretty much by-the-numbers drama about a girl from a poor urban neighborhood who tries to win the National Spelling Bee. And though I could see every plot point coming from a mile off, I still enjoyed it. Keke Palmer (\"Medea's Family Reunion\") is super precious as Akeelah and Lawrence Fishburne (\"Bobby\") keeps the teacher role from becoming terribly cliched. This would be excellent family viewing.\n\nThough Darren Aronofsky (\"Requiem for a Dream\")'s [b]The Fountain[/b] totally tanked at the box office, I was immediately drawn into it visually. Then I found myself emotionally invested in the story as well. Though I'm not sure exactly which parts were meant to be story and which parts were real life, it didn't matter. Hugh Jackman (\"Happy Feet\") totally sells every minute of each story. And did I mention the stunning visuals?",

Similar to Double Indemnity in that what seems like a perfect plan unravels because of circumstances out of their control combined with weakness of character, The Asphalt Jungle is also the blueprint for the modern heist movie. Noir had evolved from the affected and literary roots of Huston's debut, and it resembles the contemporary crime film far more in its grittier style and more naturalistic characters and dialogue. Sterling Hayden is the pick of the cast of comparatively little known character actors, and the straightforward honour and dignity of a man who is assumed to be nothing more than a violent street thug contrasts both with the obsequious and double dealing face of respectability played by Louis Calhern and the corruption of the dirty cop who breaks the case. On the down side, the female characters are a little weak and the ending feels more anti-climactic than bleak and so I personally prefer the convoluted plotting and punchy firecracker dialogue of earlier Noirs, but for those used to more realism in their tough guy street dramas, this is a great starting point.",

John Huston's stylish direction leads to memorable imagery the viewer cannot forget. Some fantastic characterisation but unfortunantly not enough screen time for them all leaving the first half of the movie sketchy and dull and hard to concentrate on.

            "content": "[img]http://members.tripod.com/~alleysplace/Gifs5/MoviePoster10.gif[/img]\n \nThe Asphalt Jungle is about a major heist that goes wrong, and the reasons that it goes wrong are plentiful and ranging. This film makes many psychological and sociological observations as to the faults of the very foundations of crimes such as burglary and murder. One reason the heist is unsuccessful is that a stool pidgeon squealed to save his own hide, another is that a man gets greedy and tries to take all the jewels for himself. Heists and other crimes involving more than one person never work because the crimes themselves are based on selfishness, greed, and the compromising of morals. If that's your crime in the first place, then how can one ever trust who you're working with? If they were willing to commit one act for their own and undeserved good, what says that they wouldn't go even further against his partners in crime? This movie says, among other messages, that one cannot ever trust a crime partner or truly believe that they can get away with a crime. And Huston does not present this idea in a preachy way. He conveys these ideals in a fashion that makes complete sense. But quality messages like these aren't enough to make a great film, and The Asphalt Jungle stumbles in a few areas. Most importantly, no emotional weight is attached to anything in the movie. The main character, Dix, isn't a complete enough character to get the viewer engaged in the film. The viewer hardly gets to know anything about him, and this is also true about the rest of the characters. When there is hardly any emotional involvement with the characters in the movie, that makes it boring. The Asphalt Jungle heaps on the boring, not only because of the characters, but the plot is also conveyed in such a fashion that one would think that the director himself isn't very interested in his own story, either. It's nice to have a social statement, but it's even better if you present it in an environment with fully developed characters and a more interesting plot. The Asphalt Jungle is the first John Huston movie I've seen and given less than a 10/10, and I hope it's the last. I love Huston for his ability to complete involve the viewer in the story and take them on an emotional rollercoaster ride, but that important trademark seems to be sorely missing in this film. I hope that it's carried out through the majority of the films by John Huston that I still have to see.",

            "content": "[color=black]Asphalt Jungle. It's a 1950's Film Noir piece, and has all of the cliche's you'd expect. This is the story of a couple of joe's who are smalltime San Francisco hooligans. There is a crooked cop, a bookie, and a plan to take diamonds with the assistance of a recently released convict with a German accent, and lust for all women. Marilyn Monroe makes her big debut, by saying more than four lines in this movie. Sterling Hayden plays a big mook with a gambling problem. He owes big time. James Whitemore, who looks surprisingly like my ex-husband Dean, is a soda jerk and all around hoodlum. A codger is used as a front to cover diamond stealing expenses, then is going to be ripping the diamonds off of the bad guys. There are only bad guys. [/color][color=black]Every character has something crooked about him or her except for the long suffering bedridden gimpy wife of the guy fronting the cash. [/color]\n[color=black]There is a full ensemble cast, and no one person stands out as the star. The direction is really the focus of this film. The story is a bit out there, with a lot of colloquialisms, and it is much longer than I expected it would be. The photography is stunning, with great long angles, rack focus play, and a lot of shadow work. Negative space is almost picasso-like..turning simple buildings into caves and walls. As a director's piece, it's brilliant. As a film for a story, it's not so great. The characters are hard to identify with, and that makes it a bit difficult to find a protagonist at all. The didactic pontification done by the police chief both at the beginning and in the end of the film is a bit over the top. Unlike Double Indemnity, one of my all time favorite films, I didn't feel attached to the story or the people portrayed. It was just motion wall paper. the one thing I did note, Marilyn Monroe's acting was just J-lo like... flat with sex appeal as the only purpose. I guess her presence always put her as a hero of mine, but her abilities as a thespian had a lot of holes. This movie made her a cartoon character out of hustler, and nothing more. [/color]\n---- \n[color=#000000]Mamet's Spartan, starring Val Kilmer and Bill Macy, with a big appearance by Ed O'Neill, in his full Popeye Doyle style acting. [/color]\n \n[color=#000000]Spartan is a film about some Secret Service agents keeping track of a presidential candidate or incumbant's daughter. There is never any mention of the actual job of the guarded family. In full Mamet fashion, the dialog is full of repeating lines, metered dialogue, and curious wordings. The way Mamet has decided to use the language of the world is completely unique. He colors pronouns, he dances around phrases, he calls back full conversations in three or four syllables. It's fascinating use of English.[/color]\n[color=#000000]The story involves a kidnapped girl, who was under the supervision of the Secret Service. Val Kilmer plays a retired marine gunnery sargeant, who now works special programs, including the training of special recruits. It was hard not to see him as Batman in this. He played his character that way. It's not easy to figure out what the characters' realties are, but there is enough to keep you riveted and asking yourself, \"okay, what now?\" That kind of story is fascinating to watch. It was, at times, a little over my head. I readily admit that there were spots where I had no clue what was going on, and it would have been great to have Columbo or someone appear and fill me in. The kidnapping leads to sex slavery, and the people involved let the world think that the kidnapped gal was killed. It was all twists, and wildness. Bill Macy is a very creepy character. You're never really sure what he does, until the end, and I'll not be doing the spoiler thing.[/color]",
