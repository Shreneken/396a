While there isn't much physical threat, it's the women and their harsh dialogue that drives the film and creates such a moody and brilliant atmosphere.  Bette Davis is stunning as the older Broadway star who seems to have it all but ultimately isn't happy with her life.  Anne Baxter plays Eve Harrington who at first seems like an innocent and aspiring fan of Margo (Bette Davis) but as the film rolls on she reveals the fame hungry and devious monster she is.  Filled with memorable and famous quotes, \"All About Eve\" is one that really does get better with age and will leave it's viewers happy to have seen it!",

People consider this as one of the finest films ever made, and I cannot disagree. This and Shawshank Redemption are actually films that deserve to be in the top 250. The black and white cinematography is gorgeous, and the script is sharp and focused with great lines such as \"Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night\". The direction is excellent, and this is further advantaged by a terrific cast, a very good subject matter and sumptuous costumes. I couldn't help being captivated by Bette Davis's performance as Margo Channing, her presence in the film is actually the film's main merit. Davis was an incredible actress, and while not exactly pretty compared to Maaureen O'Hara and Rita Hayworth and not very easy to work with at times, she always brought a sense of command to all her roles, especially in this film. I still think that All About Eve is her best film, I honestly do, and she is well supported by a terrific supporting cast with the likes of the idealistic Anne Baxter and the suave George Sanders. All in all, a beautiful film, that is a must-see, if you haven't seen it already. It is quite long, but it is well worth watching for Davis's performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The movie is also rich in commentary about theater, stardom, love and aging. The movie is somewhat theatrical and has its little bumps.

Bette Davis has free rein as an aging diva, while Anne Baxter offers a more controlled performance as an aspiring actress, working her way up the business.  Both are great, with Davis the more memorable.  Celeste Holm is terrific as the film's moral compass (moral by Broadway / Hollywood standards, of course).  The men take second stage (excuse the pun !) in this film, with Gary Merrill, George Sanders and Hugh Marlowe all very good.  Marilyn Monroe has a small but very funny role typecast as an aspiring ... Marilyn Monroe.  It's full of biting wit, outsized personalities, and the all-too-human proclivity to scheme and plot.

Who knew that writer and director Joseph Mankiewicz's scathing observations on mid-20th century celebrity would seem so quaint in comparison to today's Kardashian level vapidness. Times change, but whereas talent wasn't always enough, now it isn't even required.  \n\nBlind ambition is as old as MacBeth, yet Mankiewicz delivers a modern twist, with the new celluloid royalty of his time. The dialogue hasn't lost a step, as delivered by a who's who of A-list stars.  From the previous generation's greatest, Bette Davis, to a darling of the moment, Anne Baxter.  Toss in another Oscar winner in Celeste Holm, along with the woman that still holds the record for the most best supporting actor nods, Thelma Ritter.  It remains the sole film to receive four acting nominations for female actors.  You will never see that again.  Oh, and someone named Marilyn Monroe appears in her first cameo role too.  The final result, 14 Oscar nods, a record yet to be broken.\n\nAlong with his directing win, Mankiewicz rightfully took home a statue for best screenplay.  His broad script brought to light the blatant ageism that plagues female actors till this day, while also exposing the sycophantic relationship between performer and critic. As scum personified, George Sanderson nails the pivotal role of Addison Dewitt, scoring yet another Oscar for the film.  It's an iconic movie that remains relevant, filled with characters you won't soon forget. On the must-see list for any classic film buff.",

Her mixture of passion for the theatrical arts with her tragic personal life made her reputable as the \"Queen of Tragedy.\" The term was coined from a Greek mythological figure Melpomene, the God of Tragedy, one of the nine daughters of Zeus, and originally the God of Song. Siddons, likewise, rose to tragedy after her strained marriage and death of five of her seven children. Her legacy would be appropriated in a painting that compared two idols, one that would centuries later be hung at Margo Channing's (Bette Davis) home in the film All About Eve. Channing, like Siddons, stepped into theatre at a young age and continued to garnish her reputation on Broadway. However, unlike Siddons, the modern Goddess of Tragedy faces the challenge of being replaced on stage, particularly by Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter), her understudy. Like Siddons and the Melpomene, she is painted with admiration in the theatrical arts, even after her retirement. Once the younger actress is given the Award, Eve will inspire from Margo's legacy, wear the crown, and become an idol herself. Furthermore, comparing Margo Channing to Sarah Siddons makes All About Eve's story of a fallen idol passing her torch to another more significant and powerful. \n\n(5 Sarah Siddons Awards out of 5)",

            "content": "Based on Mary Orr's The Wisdom of Eve, itself inspired by a true anecdote, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's All About Eve is a blistering satire on the acting profession in general and theatre in particular. It won six Academy Awards and was nominated for a record-breaking fourteen and it's easy to see why: whilst some Best Picture winners haven't stood the test of time, All About Eve is every bit the classic its reputation would suggest.\nThe story is about the eponymous Eve, a fan of theatre actress Margo Channing, who gets to meet her idol, is employed by her, and then gradually starts to inveigle herself into Margo's life, eventually stealing her fame. That sounds fairly straightforward, but Mankiewicz' screenplay is about far more than just Eve and Margo. Critics have read many different things into the film, but most strikingly the plot takes broad pot-shots at theatre life and it does so with biting wit. At no point is the audience likely to believe that people really talk in this way, but within the context of the narrative it works perfectly. There is, for example, a hilarious scene immediately after Eve's audition when Margo, Lloyd and Max trade extravagantly barbed insults. There's lots of material here too about the theatre versus cinema, as Bill's monologue on what theatre is demonstrates.\nThe screenplay isn't just a collection of pithy one-liners: the characterisation works brilliantly and the casting is perfect. Anne Baxter is very convincing as Eve, whose gradual take-over of Margo's life and career is very subtle at first, winning over Margo, Bill and Karen with a sob story about her husband, winning a job with her, and then slowly starting to interfere. She gets increasingly devious, for example when she ensures that Lloyd's car runs out of gas so that she has to perform instead of Margo and she even tries \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to seduce Bill and shows real anger for the first time when she fails. We don't see her being openly manipulative or indeed malevolent until she blackmails Karen into convincing Lloyd to give her the part of Cora. Later, she plans to lure Lloyd away from Karen, not because she is interested in him sexually, but because of his importance as a high-earning theatre playwright. Baxter goes from seemingly shy and awkward fan to ruthless career actress with ease: her eyes light up when Eve is breathlessly imagining the adoration of an audience.\nBette Davis is well cast as aging theatre star Margo Channing, and gives an utterly convincing performance even when she's delivering outrageous lines; Margo is an aging theatre actress with a superb reputation, but who is painfully aware of her advancing years (she's just turned forty) and the fact that her boyfriend Bill is eight years her junior. Her fears of fading glory turn out to be justified as Eve eventually supplants her. Celeste Holm and Gary Merrill are very good as Margo's best friend Karen and lover Bill, who dreams of breaking into Hollywood, whilst Hugh Marlowe convinces as theatre director Lloyd Richards, who frequently clashes with his diva of a star. But the show is stolen from all of them by George Sanders as Addison DeWitt, a supremely devious and snide theatre critic who believes that he is as much \"theatre folk\" as any actor or director and who proves to be the master manipulator, seizing control of Eve \u2013 and her success \u2013 without her even noticing it. Sanders gets all the best lines, although with plenty to go around Davis comes a close second.\nMankiewicz uses all manner of directing tricks to great effect, from freeze-frames to tracking shots. The film opens with a droll voiceover from DeWitt, who sets the scene with a withering analysis about the acting profession works, and later various characters chip in with voice-overs at times, recalling the events as they unfold. The plot isn't really focalised through any one character, with the points of view of various used at different points.  A notable exception is Eve: we never gain any insight into her mind until DeWitt exposes her past at the end and interestingly we never actually see Eve perform \u2013 her audition and subsequent understudy performance both happen off-screen. Cinematographer Milton R. Krasner's use of wide-angle and deep focus shots adding a sense of scale to the mise-en-sc\u00e9ne, with cameras often following the actors: thus, the art of the cinema is use to skilfully depict a film about theatre. The final touch is that Alfred Newman's score is sparingly used, so that musical only plays at key moments, usually when Eve has a success that leads another step closer to her acting apotheosis.\nThe final masterstroke is that as Eve leaves Broadway for Hollywood, she meets a young woman who will clearly do to her what she did to Margo \u2013 a fact that puppet master DeWitt actively encourages. It's a wry and cynical ending to a film that is every bit as brilliant as the many accolades it receives would indicate.",

I don't want to spoil that, even though this film has existed for 70 years\u2026 All About Eve features the famous line, \"Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night.\" A few of my other favorites are \"Barroom Benzedrine megalomaniac.\" And \"All playwrights should be dead for 300 years!\" The full-circle ending is satisfying and the final shot is beautiful. If you like exceptional acted, black and white, smoke-filled, martini-drenched, wit-slinging, Bette Davis-eyed, movies, this one is not to be missed.",

            "content": "Show business satires have never quite equaled either All About Eve or Sunset Boulevard (1950). The writing, the performances, the style, the use of narration and the actors being willing to comment upon themselves make both films work so well and therefore it is difficult to call one better than the other. The story of women manipulating one another to attain power has appeared on screen several times with the recent success of The Favorite (2018) allowing for a resurgence in appreciation of the genre. This is the mother of them all however as we watch a dark narrative play out and feel almost ashamed in ourselves as we revel in the nastiness of it all.\n\nA young theatre fan Eve Harrington, Anne Baxter, quickly ingratiates herself into the life of her idol, Broadway star Margo Channing, Bette Davis, but her intentions soon prove to be less than innocent. What follows is a game of manipulation in which we discover that Eve is not who she has sold herself to Margo and close friend Karen Richards, Celeste Holm, as and that her main ambition is to become a star, an ambition that she is willing to tear Margo down to achieve. Both women fight over a certain part in a stage play before Margo settles down with her younger boyfriend Bill Sampson, Gary Merrill, and Eve is manipulated by gossip columnist Addison DeWitt, George Sanders, after a brief dalliance with Lloyd Richards, Hugh Marlowe, Karen's husband. The final scene implies that the manipulation of stars by ambitious younger women is simply a cycle and Eve too will face her comeuppance.\n\nWhat occurred to me when watching the film was how impeccably the dialogue was written. Every scene is filled with witty one liners and cultural references but they never distract from the drama at hand and small details such as Eve referencing a \u2018Shubert Theatre in San Francisco', which doesn't exist, hint at the deeper cynicism of the film. Each character, even Miss Casswell, is complex and gets a moment to show just how vicious they are to have survived in the industry. The allusions to royalty throughout may be obvious but that doesn't make them any less effective as you imagine that the actresses talking about thrones and crowns did imagine being princesses as young girls but grew up and realized they needed to be Queens and rule the kingdom or theatre in order to survive.\n\nThe performances are superlative as everyone from Bette Davis to Celeste Holm portrays their character with an incredible amount of clarity as they deliver dialogue with that wonderful 1950s fromage. Davis gives what I believe to be one of her best performances as the ruthless, fading star who is manipulated by someone working right under her nose. The role works partly because of Davis' reputation as a diva and her rivalry with Joan Crawford as both were desperate to hold on to their stardom and prevent younger actresses from eclipsing them. Baxter is deliciously awful as she is almost sinister in how charming she appears initially but when we realize that she truly is villainous we can see how she has been playing everybody around her for so long. Holm is reliably fantastic, she is the best part of Gentleman's Agreement (1947), as the innocent who gets duped and ultimately feels guilty and Thelma Ritter excels as the tragic Birdie giving a naturalistic, intelligent performance amid showy, literate actors.\n\nI would have given this film Best Picture because by the thinnest of margins I would call it better than the iconic Sunset Boulevard. I know that is a controversial choice but this is an impeccable film in which every element works perfectly and it deserves to be considered one of the greatest films of all time. The film touches on issues in show business but perhaps more interestingly it talks about the glass ceilings that women face and the encouragement of vicious competition between women causing bitterness. It makes you wonder, had conditions been better for women in Hollywood during this time period, would Joan Crawford and Bette Davis have feuded so publicly?",

Davis is an extraordinary screen presence, with a gravelly voice and all the facial expressions in the world, she realistically depicts a starlet who was once on top of the world but is now being forced to accept that the limelight may not be shining on her for much longer. The film goes on too long in many scenes and I found the screenplay to be unnecessarily verbose, with many conversations dragging on because the characters insist on delivering long, fancified answered or explanations when short, concise ones would do much better. But the highlights are the quality of the acting and the rivalry between Eve and Margot, which begins out friendly but slowly disintegrates into spitefulness and envy as one individual's success overtakes the other. Due to its length and excessive wordiness, I can't see myself rushing to see it again, but for a chance to see so many big names of the mid-20th century duking it out on screen in classic fashion, I'm very happy I've seen in once.",

Writer and director Joseph L. Mankiewicz simply rivets you with a tale of dazzling talent of shrewd betrayal.\n\nYou have to care about filmmaking, Hollywood, celebrities, acting, casting, and fame to really appreciate All About Eve, but the basic narrative about treachery and jealousy is universal.\n\nBette Davis is perfect as the jealous diva aging disgracefully with lewd biting remarks.\n\nAnne Baxter is sublime as the sweet and innocent pretender desiring fame and success above all. Baxter is particularly enchanting and terrifying in her complex role.\n\nWith an all star supporting cast ranging from George Sanders to Marilyn Monroe herself, All About Eve captures the seedy underbelly of show business like never before! It's remarkable how Mankiewicz basically has many of his ensemble playing versions of themselves. He's satirizing and critiquing the shallow and disloyal Hollywood populace, while also admiring the film and theater industries.\n\nThat is the key to All About Eve's success. Mankiewicz directed a classic about how much he clearly loved the movies and plays, but he must have felt compelled to address the lesser attributes to the world he lived in with All About Eve. It's all a vicious cycle of people using others for their own advantages in the end, but All About Eve is entertaining and devastating to witness unfold.",

It's just an excuse for the Academy to stroke it's own arrogance generally and the \"hardships\" they endure. Everybody gives a good performance, but contrary to popular opinion I don't think even Davis put in an amazing performance. The film discusses the back-handedness of the theater and film industries, although this kind of thing is found in many other professions as well. I think the reason it won Best Picture is because it's a film where the Academy gets to feel important and they tend to gravitate to films like that. There were some comedic moments, but it wasn't much of a knee slapper, the drama and twist were good but formulaic and there are a number of plot holes that go unanswered. The film's message is that people will do anything to get into theater and mirrors a lot of the journeys that people took to get into it in the first place (like I said, it's why it appeals to them) and that you can't take everything someone says at face value, but I've found that is quite a cynical way to look at things. You can't be naive, but giving people the benefit of the doubt more often helps than harms, in my experience.",

Mankiewicz's All About Eve that 67 years after it's initial release it still holds up as one of the finest examples comic dramas ever shown on screen. It is a film that can be viewed as the rule book for aspiring screenwriters, the swift notes for student actors and a timely lesson to all film fans that a well told parable, with a smart dialogue and talented cast wins hands down over any CGI effects, camera tricks or show stopping stunts that technology can muster up.\nBased on the story The Wisdom of Eve by Mary Orr, All About Eve is an elegantly bitchy backstage story revolving around aspiring actress Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter). Tattered and forlorn, Eve shows up in the dressing room of Broadway mega-star Margo Channing (Bette Davis), weaving a melancholy life story to Margo and her friends. Taking pity on the girl, Margo takes Eve as her personal assistant. Before long, it becomes apparent that naive Eve is a Machiavellian conniver who cold-bloodily uses Margo, her director Bill Sampson (Gary Merill), Lloyd's wife Karen (Celeste Holm), and waspish critic Addison De Witt (George Sanders) to rise to the top of the theatrical heap.\nThematically multi-layered, this sharp and witty written film  won 6 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and a Best Supporting Actor for the magnificent George Sanders.\nIn fact it has the unique honour of seeing two actresses and two actors nominated in the Best Actor/Best Actress category at the Academy Awards - a feat that has not been repeated since.\nUnsullied by the demands and technology of modern cinema, this classic Hollywood tale is a wonderful insight to the backstabbing backstage of Broadway as the heavy weight bout between these two divas comes fuelled with poisonous yet witty dialogue in a timely reminder that as the cliche goes \"the don't make em like they used to\"!",

ALL ABOUT EVE, on the other hand, is, at bottom, all about the dialogue and its delivery, tongue-twisting words performed with gut-wrenching gusto, and so more in line with the stage than with the screen in that way. These words are like fireworks, explosive and exciting, made of music and crackling fire, dense with allusions and acidic with wit-and in a movie about the potential violence and power to wound of words when wielded by serpentine tongues, the screenplay is as much the star of the show as the cast, who sink their teeth into these wisecracks and whip snaps with relish.",

Whenever I'm asked who my favorite actress is, I always respond with Bette Davis, even though I'm often met with a perplexed blank stare. I get it, though; Ms. Davis isn't exactly from my time, and to be honest, if it weren't for my mother exposing me to black and white movies, I don't think I would have come across this gem of a movie either.\n\nFor anyone who has ever daydreamed about what it would be like to meet and work with their idol, All About Eve wonderfully captures this. Eve, played by Anne Baxter (The Ten Commandments), is a young aspiring actress with an overt adoration for Margo Channing (Bette Davis), an aging Broadway star who pities Eve's sad life story and takes her under her wing. Although well intentioned, Margo soon discovers that Eve doesn't just worship her but strategizes to become Margo's unwelcomed prodigy.\n\nNow it's one thing to have another woman try to steal your job from you, but the claws really come out when Eve attempts to win over Margo's man and two best friends. Although I began by rooting for Eve, by the middle of the movie I was throwing popcorn at the screen and mumbling a few choice words at her. But that's what makes this movie so great; it sends the viewer on a wave of all kinds of emotions.\n\nWhile the drama of a backstabbing plot is exciting on its own, there was something else I appreciated about this movie (and well, all old Hollywood movies), and that's the purity in theatrical acting prior to the 1960s. To me, watching classic Hollywood cinema feels more like watching a play than a movie; the performances from each actor are lively and overdramatized, creating a beautiful harmony of drama and humor in the satire of Broadway.\n\nThe worst thing about this movie is also the best - it's a black and white movie. A lot of people won't typically seek out black and white movies and perhaps that is why this one will go unnoticed as time progresses. It's almost as if the absence of color forced me to pay closer attention to the storytelling rather than the screen itself.\n\nAll About Eve has been a gift that I am indebted to my mother for showing me because each time I watch it, it's like being in the presence of some of the greatest actors to have existed. For anyone who is willing to go on this rollercoaster of emotions, in the words of Margo Channing, I encourage you to \"fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night!\"\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/all-about-eve, and was written by Brittney Sharae.

Before long, it becomes apparent that na\u00c3\u00afve Eve is a Machiavellian conniver who cold-bloodedly uses Margo, her director Bill Sampson (Gary Merill), Lloyd's wife Karen (Celeste Holm), and waspish critic Addison De Witt (George Sanders) to rise to the top of the theatrical heap. Also appearing in All About Eve is Marilyn Monroe, introduced by Addison De Witt as \"a graduate of the Copacabana school of dramatic art.\" This is but one of the hundreds of unforgettable lines penned by writer/director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, the most famous of which is Margo Channing's lip-sneering admonition, \"Fasten your seat belts. It's going to be a bumpy night.\" All About Eve received 6 Academy Awards, including Best Picture.  Smart, sophisticated, and devastatingly funny, All About Eve is a Hollywood classic that only improves with age.",

            "content": "Bette Davis is so effortless and breathes fire in her performance as Margot, an aging actress who finds herself slowly and insidiously being usurped by a young fan, Eve, played by Anne Baxter.  I don't think it's in a 'best ever' type of discussion, or worthy of its 14 Academy Award nominations, but its sharp dialog, predatory manipulation, and overall bitchiness make it entertaining, even if it's hard to like the characters.  \n\nThere are some great lines here; in addition to the famous \"Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night\", I loved it when Davis exclaimed \"I'm not twenty-ish, I'm not thirty-ish.  Three months ago I was forty years old. Forty. 4-0. That slipped out.  I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it.  Now I suddenly feel as if I've taken all my clothes off.\"  Davis herself was 42, and this line and others ring true.  George Sanders (as Addison DeWitt) is also fantastic, at one point saying \"You're an improbable person, Eve, and so am I. We have that in common. Also, a contempt for humanity, an inability to love and be loved, insatiable ambition, and talent. We deserve each other.\"\n\nThese quotes capture the spirit of the movie, which to me is simply about the difficulties that aging women face, and the cold and calculating world of the theater.  There is supposedly a homosexual element, a theory put forth and apparently confirmed by writer and director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, but it's so subtle, perhaps because of the Hays Code, that it didn't even register with me, and I think it's irrelevant.  These characters are in the best cases rough around the edges, and in the worse, simply awful people.  We see Margot being slowly replaced and want to feel sympathy for her, but it's tough because she's so abrasive.  We see the evil side of Eve slowly unveil itself as it becomes apparent she's far from being a starstruck fan or even who she says she is.  And at the end we see that she, too, will be replaced.  It's all a bit grim: time, a machine that grinds them down, and competition for glory that leads to Machiavellian backstabbing.  It's ironic that Davis was such a diva that there was discord amongst the actors, and Baxter pushing her way into a 'Best Actress' nomination instead of 'Best Supporting Actress' would lead to a division of the vote and neither of them winning.  I was happy to see Marilyn Monroe in a small part at age 24 and before she was big, just to bring some lightness into the film.  This is certainly a good movie, don't get me wrong, but it's not one I'd watch again and again as I would my favorites.",

However, it might be one of the best implementations of that plot-line. Huge credit has to go to Anne Baxter because she plays the part of Eve so brilliantly that I was genuinely surprised at her turn in the third act, despite the familiarity of these tropes. The rest of the cast is spectacular as well, but I think the effectiveness of the film hinges on Baxter's performance. The way the climax of this film plays out is positively brilliant and it resolves each character's story in a way that I didn't anticipate. The final scene might be one of the most fitting I've ever seen. I did find there were moments that the film dragged a little, particularly when they continued to drive home a point that they had already established. I'm not sure I was entirely sold on the flashback storytelling, either. It was particularly odd because they kept changing narrators for the flashbacks, which seemed pointless. Most of my trouble with All About Eve was relatively minor, though. This is a sensational film that has aged well, because it explores timeless themes that still apply today. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",

This film doesn't need a critic this film already has one; a parody of one I thought. I mean who better to narrate or tell the story the people who make or break movies with word, word that are sometimes nice and othen venomous, it doesn't matter who tells the story really. \n\ncontrary to popular believe this film is not all about Eve, hehe. A aging actor who has long since losted the love for her art-form, is slowly falling from her own grace. She feels she is losing youth, she takes out the aggression of whats happening on her biggest fan, or is she?! \nA classic drama film, or so I hear. If your an action film person (that's the educational term), this film will bore the shit out of you. I am divided between the two. I can watch anything, this film kept me interested and is definitely great, especially in the eyes of drama fans. I watched it, felt bored near the end, but I have an exstreamly short attention span. I just don't know, my views are that of horror fan, or maybe even a art-house fan to.

Mankiewicz is sending \"letters to three wives\", and now it's all about Eve. \"I have to be strong, you had to be free, 'cause it's all about Eve!\" I'm symphonic prog-rockin' here, Kamelot style, and I'm supposed to be talking about a film which predates any kind of rock. I don't know what to say, because, come on, just how interesting can a drama which got nominated for 14 Oscars - scoring six, including Best Picture -, b and supposedly features a lesbian be? I can practically feel my eyes drying out, there are so many men somewhere out widening their eyes when I say that Anne Baxter is playing at least a pseudo-lesbian, but again, this film is from 1950, so that's the only thing they're painstakingly subtle about. The only kind of homosexuality that we know for certain pertains to this film is among men, because Bette Davis has quite the role in gay subculture, probably because her voice has just the right amount of depth for gay men to do impressions. It doesn't exactly hurt that this film is pretty good to begin with, and yet, as worthy as this film is of all of its praise, there are indeed aspects to shake up its intrigue.\r\n\r\nThe film's plot is so well drawn and handled that, to see the turn into the 1950s, this film is surprisingly unpredictable, but it can transcend conventions for only so long before succumbing to narrative tropes, if not moderate Hollywoodisms of the time. What distinguishes this film is its subtlety and depth as a drama of the '40s and '50s, but there are occasions of superficiality which might not be too glaring, but feel as though they are, in contrast to the subtleties, and under the pressure of the histrionics. I've heart warming of campiness, and although I hardly find cheesiness on that level, the razor-sharp dialogue occasionally gets improbably heavy-handed with its theatrical wit, while near-trite characterization thins down the depths of generally richly written and portrayed, to the point of being supplementary to a melodramatic plot. The plot is driven by melodramatics as a portrait on pursuing stardom through a companionship with, if not the overthrowing of an aging idol, and it's not entirely easy to buy in on them, partly because it seems as though they're compensating for natural shortcomings, which are obscured by inspired storytelling, but challenge one's investment even on paper. You have plenty of time to ponder upon the natural and consequential shortcomings, because among the bigger issues of the film is a length of almost 140 minutes which gets to be repetitious, maybe even aimless after a while, demanding quite a bit of patience. With entertainment value and dramatic intrigue, this film ought to firmly secure one's investment time and again, but its grip is loosened by subtle missteps whose betrayal of inspiration make it all the harder to disregard. The final product hasn't age completely with grace, but to be a film of its type and time, it's solid, and even to this day, it thoroughly compels, even in concept.\r\n\r\nFeaturing the occasional tropes, and driven by melodramatics which attempt to compensate for natural shortcomings, this story concept is not especially meaty on its own, but its thematic value is rich with intrigue, exploring the ambiguities of the intentions of an aspiring actress working with an idol she may be aiming to succeed, and the paranoia of an aging talent who fears that her best years are behind her, and that she is to be overpowered by new talent. This story, for all its histrionics and natural shortcomings, is conceptually solid, and Joseph L. Mankiewicz tells it very well, at least as a director, structuring scenes more tightly than he does as writer, to where entertainment value is kept consistent, until the slow spots come in right when they need to, and grace this film with something that was a rare gem to find during this time: subtlety. Subtlety isn't entirely there on paper, but Mankiewicz's direction is rich with taste and generally defiant of Hollywood superficialities of the time, to where it explores dramatic and thematic potential thoroughly, with the help of worthy scripted material. Mankiewicz's writing is more flawed than his direction, arguably because it might be more ambitious, - to the point of bloating plotting into repetition, maybe even a hint of cheesiness - yet even it stands out for the time, and still impresses by today's standards, with generally crackling dialogue and an effective portrayal of the artistry of and corruption within the theatre. As for the individual characters, although some of them feel like types, most all major roles are distinguished, with depths and layers that bond with the melodramatic characterization generally organically enough to augment human intrigue, which is augmented best by quite the solid cast. About as consistently impressive as anything is the acting, which is realized across the board, with anyone from the charismatic George Sanders and the relatable Celeste Holm, to the lovely, if a touch dated and sometimes unevenly used (Maybe it isn't really \"all about eve\") Anne Baxter - who is initially endearing as an aspiring talent and innocent young lady who slowly, but surely begins to show dark colors when she finds her dreams realized, possibly at the expense of others' - and, of course, leading lady Bette Davis, who charismatically captures the sophistication of a more grounded starlet, brutally humanized by the fear of being replaced by a fresher face, and coming to terms with her age and humanity, and how she affects her peers, both positively and negatively. Davis' effectiveness is limited by now-dated material, but her nuance and dramatics layers are relatively spot-on, driving the depths of this surprisingly subtle drama, but not alone, as there is enough realization on and off of the screen to drive the final product as consistently compelling.\r\n\r\n\"All\" in \"all\", if you will, occasions of convention and superficiality are a little hard to ignore in the context of surprisingly tasteful storytelling, whose subtlety and grace are still challenged firmly by melodramatics which join repetitious dragging in emphasizing the natural shortcomings of this story of limited consequence, which is still rich with dramatic and thematic intrigue that is handled with enough effectiveness within the entertaining and engrossing direction, intelligent writing and strong performances which make \"All About Eve\" an uncommonly and rewardingly effective drama of cinema's golden era.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

            "content": "The winner of 6 Academy Awards out of 14 nominations, All About Eve sounded like a classic I couldn't miss.\n\nAll About Eve has a distinctly classical feel to it due to the style of the film, so any appreciator of classical cinema will find appreciation with it.\nThere are a few minor issues I would have with the film, with the main one being that the title of the film is rather misleading because while it is called All About Eve the focus is actually significantly more on the life of Margo Channing. Although the story is very interesting and has a lot of firmly complicated yet realistic characters to it, I just presumed that the story would focus more on Eve because the title suggest that the film is all about her, and that just did not prove to feel like the case in the end with All About Eve.\nBut still, All About Eve is memorable simply on the basis of the fact that it exposes everything in the true nature of Hollywood in the year 1950 during a time when everything was being glamourised. For one of the first times in Hollywood history, All About Eve depicted the true nature of what it is to be an actor and how we live in a dog-eat dog world, and with an excellent script it manages to tell nothing but the truth through its characters while capturing the realistic language of the time that the film was from. All About Eve is one of the most honest depictions of society in the 1950's Hollywood scene and took a significantly less optimistic approach to things than the more cliche of Hollywood films should, so it sort of touches upon the ideals of the counterculture era before such a time even existed as it would not come fourth for another decade. All About Eve is a rather prescient film for its time, and its messages still carry today so it truly is a great example of a classic that gets better with age. And while the story is rather simplistic with the focus being all on the characters and the script, it is still and intelligent and thought provoking film which is chock full of great dialogue and strong characters for the actors to work with, so All About Eve serves as an example of some of Joseph L. Makiewicz's best directional skill as he handles the material very finely and breathes some stylish direction into the film as well so that it maintains a strong sense of art direction and nice cinematography all throughout, as well as an effective classical musical score.\nBut the finest element of All About Eve which makes it an unforgettable film is the strength of the cast, especially the lead performance of Bette Davis.\nBette Davis' lead performance as Margo Channing is absolutely excellent. You can see that the true nature of Margo Channing as she starts of strong but gradually deteriorates in terms of her mental stability as well as age over the course of the film, and Bette Davis acts it all out perfectly. While the film is called All About Eve, with the incredible acting talent that Bette Davis presents to her character Margo Channing, she manages to make it all about Margo without trouble. At an age of 42, Bette Davis boasts the beauty of a woman in her early 30's while in certain scenes they intentionally emphasise her age for the sake of her character. And it makes her perfect for the character, yet it is overshadowed by the fact that with her acting talent she just sinks straight in to the role. She has the feeling of a Golden Age Hollywood actress because that is exactly who she is, so the role is no challenge for her as she is essentially playing another version of herself. She manages to give an unforgettable performance, one clearly well deserving of the Academy Award nomination that she scored for the film. Bette Davis is a very impressive actress, and it is hard to walk away from All About Eve not having felt the full effect of the film solely on the basis of her performance in how she delivers her lines with passion and a sense of wisdom as well as despair, and the way that she conveys her emotions to the audience. Bette Davis is spectacular in All About Eve.\nAnd the performance of Anne Baxter in the titular role of Eve is a great one as well. As she starts of rather friendly but gradually develops into a subtle yet effectively antagonistic character, she makes the transition of development a very good process. Anne Baxter allows everything about Eve Harrington to come to her naturally in All About Eve and it proves to be one of the strongest performances of her career simply because she has a fierce dedication to succeeding in the role just as her character does, whatever the price may be. In her performance, she reveals the true nature of what you have to do to succeed in Hollywood and she lets nothing hold back the best of her strengths as an actor, so her performance is an easily memorable one.\nThe strong supporting performance of George Sanders makes everything in the experience a lot more dramatic, as do the efforts of both Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter.\nThe brief appearance of the young Marilyn Monroe is also a nice touch for All About Eve considering that her image would later go on to make her more internationally recognisable than anyone else in this film.\n\nSo all in all, All About Eve is a definite classic due to the fact that it is stylish, it takes an honest and meaningful look at Hollywood with the strength of its intelligent script and above all the fact that it is undeniably flawlessly acted from a list of talented actors who scored the film five Academy Award nominations for acting, although none of them outshine the immense skill of Bette Davis.",
