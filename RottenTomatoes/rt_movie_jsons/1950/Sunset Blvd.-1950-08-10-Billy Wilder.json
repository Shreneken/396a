            "content": "Schaefer (Nancy Olson) as they are working on a screenplay together that is actually a pleasant and eventually romantic experience for the two.  Norma is on to him though and with her mind on the brink of despair and collapse and Joe growing more and more tired of her control over him, there is going to be a fallout suitable to the scale of a major film production. \n     Sunset Boulevard is a crowing jewel of American cinema and currently sits at #16 on The American Film Institutes Top 100 Films list.  It's scathing and grim look inside Hollywood is both dark and gritty, showcasing it's film-noir roots, but also smart and utterly thought provoking in it's message!  Billy Wilder's touches are superb as he incorporates much symbolism within his film adding deeper layers of meaning.  For instance, the gold chain Norma gives Joe that catches on a door symbolic of her keeping him trapped in her home and the boom mic that brushes against Norma's hat when it was the dialogue it picks up that ended her career.  The butler Max was very much like the real Erich von Stroheim as a director who fell from greatness and the \"Waxwork\" faces were real actors of the silent era as well and included Anna Q Nilsson, H.B. Warner, and Buster Keaton.  The film shown in the home theatre of Norma is actually a real film, Queen Kelly (1928) that Erich von Stroheim directed and starred Gloria Swanson which had devastating effects.  These touches and parallels within the dark and seemingly surface-deep level of Hollywood and decay/death as a central theme all add up to a powerful and at the time, very controversial release.  \"Sunset Boulevard\" stands as one of the best of American cinema and is thoroughly captivating to this day, 64 years after it's initial release!",

A mix of film noir, drama/melodrama, and satire, with a little added spice of witty quips, it tells a realistic story, and tells it so scrupulously it sounds like it was true. Billy Wilder and the cast make sure that before criticizing certain aspects relating to Hollywood moviemaking, they perfect them and avoid erring in a way that would actually give them the \"right\" for such criticism. They depict a pretentious silent era star with the least bit of pretentiousness. That's where the intelligence of the movie lies, and perhaps that is what makes it superb.",

What she was able to do with her eyes, facial expressions, as well as her body language alongside her actual line delivery was truly noteworthy. I feel like this film foreshadowed a great deal about the Hollywood movie industry with how it was becoming bigger and more complex and it showed how it changed even just in the first half of the 20th century (and makes you think how different it is now from even then). It also demonstrated how narcissism/self-obsession and obsession with the past can truly ruin an individual and their sanity. Overall it is truly well-made and timeless, but the only thing that kind of lost me a little was the love-triangle part of the plot, and it is true that some things don't hold up a ton anymore. Still, very remarkable for the time it came out!",

It is strange how unique parallels can exist between totally unrelated films. My previous review of \"Aguirre the Wrath of God\" commented on the blurred line between reality and fiction, resulting in a daring from of pseudo-documentary. A haunting sequence in that aforementioned film depicts the title character's total implosion within his own delusions of grandeur as he drifts imperviously into oblivion, lording it over the monkeys til the very end. Here, Wilder daringly enlists figures of the silent film era to portray themselves in a context that is more than fiction but less than nonfiction, while the sole monkey to be lorded over in the derelict mansion of Norma Desmond is already dead and awaiting a grandiloquent burial when we first meet it. Let the camera's roll, and prepare to be enchanted by this haunting parable of broken dreams.",

            "content": "It's taken me a long time to get round to it, but I've finally watched one of Billy Wilder's most acclaimed films, Sunset Boulevard, a classic tale of professional irrelevancy and the dog-eat-dog nature of Hollywood and the film business. It's a great film, more than deserving of its reputation. Boulevard's best element would have to be Gloria Swanson's performance, because it's not only a tonne of fun to watch, but it also perfectly encapsulates the themes of the film. She acts in a bizarre manner, posing and tilting her head like she's always performing for the cameras because, in her head, she is. She's a star from the silent movie era, where you couldn't community via dialogue, so it all had to be done with movement and facial expressions. She shifts around her massive house like she's performing in her latest picture. Essentially, she's playing an actress who is constantly playing a different role, and its great to watch. I found the constant narration to be a bit annoying, since too many movies I've seen in the last few years on it to explain the story rather than showing it. But here it makes thematic sense, since it's being narrated by one of the characters from beyond the grave. This means we get to see his life unfolding day by day, and at the same time find out how he feels about these events after they've transpired. The comedy works, the cinematography creates the perfect mood, and its ending is still one of cinemas most iconic, especially its closing line, which represents our heroine's complete descent into madness. It's a legendary film for good reasons, and while there's other Wilder films I would sooner watch again, Sunset Boulevard is an absolute must see movie which has stood the test of time, and will continue to be enjoyed for years to come.",

Sunset Boulevard is obviously a classic but it's clear that many films have taken inspiration from it over the years. The sets and music of this film are extravagant but the true spectacle of this film is Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond. This story of this film as a whole is great, but there is a story inside a story with Norma. There is a character study to be had that encompasses a number of layers which are easy to understand but deep in their origin and meaning. Not to say the other characters are only satisfactory, as Max and Joe are both much more. But Norma is another level that solidifies her own ego. While a noir drama at heart, there are soda spurting comedic comments that add to the overall mixture. If you're looking for unforgettable characters engrossed in an entertaining story, this is a sensational and must-see choice.",

            "content": "A biting satire on Hollywood's dark side.\n\nBilly Wilder's noir black comedy Sunset Boulevard (1950) is a revelation in filmmaking prowess and a powerful critique of how actresses get aged out of roles and the film industry at large as they fade into obscurity. Wilder's direction is a fascinating display of directorial control and sympathy for his subject as he gently depicts Gloria Swanson as an old silent film star struggling to make a name for herself in the era of talkies. Wilder's direction is very funny with a healthy dark humor about the mentally ill, desperate for fame, and loveless in Hollywood. His writing is superb, shedding light on forgotten stars and allowing audiences to empathize with elderly artists who just one want more picture or one last role.\n\nGloria Swanson is gloriously theatrical and exaggerated as Norma Desmond in all her resplendent glamour. Edith Head's costumes are lavish dresses and tailored suits that would make any fashion aficionado jealous. Swanson's erratic performance is all consuming as you are absorbed by her desperate, lonely, widower and former screen darling who needs love and adoration. William Holden and Swanson have a fun chemistry of pain and uncertainty that's intriguing. Holden plays the failed writer well and the down on his luck scriptwriter turned captive ghost writer Joe Gillis. His frustration and agony are apparent on his torn face.\n\nErich von Stroheim is excellent and apt as Gloria Swanson's loyal butler and first husband, the enigmatic Austrian Max von Mayerling. Nancy Olson is so naturally pretty and genuinely earnest as hopeful script doctor Betty Schaefer. Her romantic chemistry with William Holden is so sincere and palpable.\n\nFred Clark has a funny cameo as a jaded movie producer called Sheldrake. Cecil B. DeMille brilliantly plays himself as a caring director who kindly treats Gloria Swanson's Norma with a gentle hand. Buster Keaton and H.B. Warner cameos as themselves, who are Norma's old Hollywood buddies. Arthur P. Schmidt's editing is so quickly paced that Sunset Boulevard's 110 pass by you like a friendly whisper. John F. Seitz' black and white cinematography is striking and moody. He captures shadows and darkly lit rooms with elegance and mystique so perfectly for Sunset Boulevard.\n\nI should mention that Franz Waxman's magnificent score adds a sense of grandeur and grace alongside a bleak haunting atmosphere for the crime elements. Everything in Sunset Boulevard is shrouded in suspense thanks to Waxman's beautiful music. He even had some classical on the organ for a wonderful little scene with Erich von Streheim's Max.\n\nI loved Sunset Boulevard. While it is outstanding on its own merits, it pairs interestingly with All About Eve also from 1950. I do prefer All About Eve for Anne Baxter's legendary performance and Bette Davis' distraught acting, Gloria Swanson's Norma is as compelling as Davis's iconic role.",

            "content": "Sunset Boulevard \n\nWell this is the first review I have ever written and all I can say is, what a film to start with. I've chosen not to include spoilers in my reviews whether the film is old or is the most recent release, simply because I want others to find out what happens and make up their own minds. That is one of the many beauties of Cinema, it is subjective!\n\nFirst of all, \u2018Sunset Boulevard' is a masterful film. It certainly is one of the best films depicting Hollywood that has ever been made. Director Billy Wilder makes us, the audience, submit to what I would call the Hollywood Nightmare. How one can be at the highest of highs with their fame and career but once the industry is done with them, they are cascaded aside and left to live in the past. Norma Desmond, played magnificently by Gloria Swanson, is the example of this. From the first time we see Norma introduced in the film, we can start to unravel that this is a woman who is clearly a faded film star but is obsessed with making that return to fame. Mentally she is consumed by her popularity and constantly reminds Joe Gillis (William Holden) that all the fans send her letters, accelerating her need for the comeback. This is such a big positive of the film, the performances of Gloria Swanson and William Holden as Norma and Joe respectively blow my mind. It baffles me how Gloria did not win the Academy Award that year (1951) for Best Actress, instead losing out to Judy Holliday for \u2018Born Yesterday'. As I say, William Holden plays the bankrupt screenwriter Joe Gillis brilliantly and his relationship onscreen with Gloria shines through, as they go on the thrill ride of working together but also struggle to connect on any level, simply because of Norma's mental state. Furthermore, Erich Von Stroheim portrays Norma's Butler Max excellently and his presence on screen suggests something is hidden in the narrative. What I mean by that is, Max is very hidden and does as he's told, only later in the film do we find out why. Not only that, the ending of this film is one of the best I've seen in film. Once you understand the meaning of it and how it summarises the film, I'm sure you will come to the same conclusion.\n\n In terms of the negatives of the film, I would say, there are really none I can find. I don't like being picky and find silly reasons to be negative about a film, certainly a film as good as this one.\n\nThis is, in my opinion, Billy Wilders masterpiece. I have seen \u2018Double indemnity' also and regard that very highly as it was a film I studied while at school, however after seeing \u2018Sunset Boulevard' a couple days ago, it left a very positive mark on me. I will never forget the performances in this film as I have mentioned several times, they were just that good. I'm sure this film set the benchmark for many future directors on how to depict Hollywood and the ups and downs a career in the industry can bring. A Masterpiece. Simple as that\n\nQuote of the Film \u2013 \u2018I am Big, it's the pictures that got small' \u2013 Norma Desmond\n\nRating \u2013 9.5/10",

Joe\u00a0Gillis (William Holden) says that he is dead and he will explain\u00a0how it happened.\n\t2\tDirector Billy Wilder (Double Indemnity, The Apartment, Some Like It Hot) was at the top of his form. As a German immigrant, Wilder had a devilishly sharp\u00a0and\u00a0incisive view of American culture.\n\t3\tWilliam Holden. As our story's Everyman, his Joe Gillis tries to do the right thing. But a guy's got to pay the\u00a0bills, and so he makes some remarkably bad choices.\n\t4\tYou wouldn't think a 1950 film would involve a dead monkey, rats in the pool, and an older woman paying a young guy for sex. Don't say you weren't warned.\u00a0David Lynch's Mulholland Drive and David Cronenberg's Maps to The Stars merely build upon the foundation of this (arguably far\u00a0greater) film.\n\t5\tAs the aging and delusion actress Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson is unforgettable.

Thy eventually get to the point where they obsess over the idea of a comeback only to drive themselves deeper into delusion.\n\nSmartly written movie about the tragedies of being a once big Hollywood star.

            "content": "With the blackest of black comedies Billy Wilder removed any of the sentimentality or happy ending that had crowned his previous films such as The Lost Weekend (1945) and opted for a tough satire that is daring and depressing in equal measure. It is compelling from start to finish as we are transfixed by characters who are almost all immoral but are nevertheless fascinating. The film is also notable for the stellar leading performance from silent film star Gloria Swanson, of Sadie Thompson (1928), who rivaled stiff competition such as Bette Davis and Anne Baxter in All About Eve (1950) in the Best Actress lineup of 1950. I have no hesitance in calling the film a masterpiece as although I may not have appreciated all that was wonderful about the film in my first viewing I took in enough to be dazzled by the brilliance of the screenplay, Wilder's direction and almost everything else about the film.\n\nStruggling screenwriter Joe Gillis, William Holden, encounters faded silent film star Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson, at her dilapidated mansion when he is attempting to escape two bank employees trying to repossess his car. Desmond takes a shine to the young, handsome writer and hires him to adapt some notes that she has written for a film about Salome into a screenplay. He quickly realizes that she lives in a fantasy world of her own as her devoted servant Max, Erich von Stroheim, encourages her delusions by writing her fan letters and convincing her that director Cecil B. Demille is still interested in working with her. Gillis sneaks away to write a screenplay with the young secretary Betty Schaefer, Nancy Olson, but his deception is discovered by Desmond who does not take kindly to his efforts to have a relationship outside of their own.\n\nWhere the film finds it's heart is in Desmond who is a caricature of sorts and a monster in many ways but also a talent worthy of sympathy. Desmond has little to no self awareness and appears grotesque as she goes about her daily routine believing that the public still cares about her and treating the only man who has remained loyal to her as a pet of sorts. It is easy to view her this way in the opening scenes but it is when she begins showing off to Gillis, who is simply using her, that we begin to feel sorry for her as she lavishes him with gifts and costumes and performs her routines for the camera to him. Holden's laconic voiceover narrates most of these scenes and we grow to hate him as he exploits this mentally ill woman who has more talent than he has ever had and does not have the self awareness to realize that he is a loser. Wilder knows this and allows for our understanding of Desmond to deepen over time as our sympathy for her grows more intense and our disgust for Gillis becomes stronger.\n\nThere is a sadness to the fact that everybody in Hollywood seems to be using love to manipulate those around them as nobody is truly devoted to anybody and instead sees them as a way to further their career. Schaefer uses Gillis, Gillis uses Desmond and Desmond uses Max. You would think that each of these people would be able to recognize having taken advantage of those who do love them, that they are being manipulated and yet they don't preferring instead to live in a fantasy world. With all of the in jokes and references to Tyrone Power etc. it could be easy to dismiss the film as your traditional self referential satire but the film ties in these meta references so much better than many of the imitators that would come later. For those who have seen Something to Think About (1920) they will be even more devastated at seeing Demille politely but firmly refuse to work with Desmond again. The film lacks the irritating smugness of a film like The Informers (2008) because it is smart and does manage to comment on Hollywood's treatment of it's stars.\n\nSwanson makes for a perfect Desmond as her real life reputation plays into the effect of the film and she knows just how far to push her character's theatricality. Holden is well suited to the part of the callow leading man and grounds the film in reality while von Stroheim is heartbreaking as the devoted Max. \n\nEverything seemed to come together to make this one of those truly great films that has to be seen to appreciate.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard is a wonderful addition to his film catalog. The dark comedy noir is yet another example of Wilder's ability to create believable characters and tell a compelling story in different genres. The story is told in flashback by William Holden's character Joe Gillis, a down on his luck screen writer, who is trying to shed a couple of repo men when he comes upon the dilapidated home of Norma Desmond, a former silent movie star. She is wonderfully played by Gloria Swanson, herself a former star of the silent era, Swanson's deliciously vain and delusional portrayal of the has-been starlet is the performance of a lifetime. She was nominated for best actress, but lost out that year to Judy Holiday, Holiday won for Born Yesterday, which happens to be another part written by Wilder. As the story progresses, Gillis sells his dignity for the comfort that Ms.Desmond provides. Holden plays the part of Gillis as he does with all his movie roles: believably and honestly. William Holden was one of the most popular actors in the 1950's and it's easy to see why. Even in a role where he is somewhat of a sell-out and a gigolo, he is incredibly likeable and performs his part with a certain ease that is unique to him. The movie gets darker as it goes, with Norma sinking deeper into the delusion she has created and Joe trying to figure a way out of his trapped environment. There are bits of humor throughout, but the most fun is when Wilder takes us behind the scenes to poke fun at the movie making process. Cameos by Cecil B. DeMille and Buster Keaton are enjoyable, as well as an important part played by former director Eric von Stroheim, as Ms.Desmond's servant Max. A really great movie experience from beginning to end, Sunset Boulevard will always be relevant as long as Hollywood and Hollywood personalities exist.\n  \n exist.",

The story and acting grab you and don't let you go, especially Gloria Swanson who flawlessly plays the unhinged Norma Desmond.

The language and word choice in the narration just perfectly illustrate Joe's prowess as a writer and his cynicism.

            "content": "There is a lot to love about this movie, which is loaded with great performances, and intersects film noir with fading Hollywood stardom.  It grabs us from the start with police called to the scene of a mansion with a body floating in its pool, and as we listen to a deadpan narrator.  Director Billy Wilder gives us the first of what will be many great shots, this one from what appears to be the bottom of the pool, with policemen in the background standing over the body.  \n\nThe film then flashes back to a young writer (William Holden), down on his luck and pressured by repo men, trying to figure out a way to sell his work or borrow some money.  He pulls into the driveway of a mansion by chance, and finds himself slowly entangled in another trap, that of an aging Hollywood star (Gloria Swanson).  The feel is eerie from the start, as she seeks funeral arrangements for her pet chimp, lives in boundless ostentation, and has a single companion, her solemn servant (Erich von Stroheim) who plays an organ that otherwise wheezes drearily when the wind blows through it.  While her pool and tennis courts have fallen into ruin, she lives in the past, surrounded by her own photographs and watching her own old movies.  Out of what he feels to be necessity, he begins working for her and living with her, hating every moment.\n\nGloria Swanson, who was 51, turns in an outstanding performance, and has several fantastic scenes.   The one where she and Holden sit in the dark with the projector light going through smoke is brilliant, and one of my favorites.  Another is him dancing with her on the floor that she says Valentino had danced on, surrounded by an orchestra and expecting other guests, only to realize there will be none.  The one where she imitates Charlie Chaplin, complete with a little tramp outfit, is truly special.\n\nWilder is excellent at gradually revealing just how far gone she is.  It was a nice touch of his to include silent movie stars as her bridge companions in a small scene, including Buster Keaton, and to see Cecil B. DeMille on the set at Paramount was fantastic.  We see both her delusion of still being an important star as she rolls up to the gate house in her expensive old car (an Isotta-Fraschini), and yet we also see her past stardom recognized by one of the gate keepers, and then people on the set when they realize she's there.  It's a very touching moment.  \n\nThings get more complicated when Holden begins working with the fianc\u00e9 (Nancy Olson) of his affable friend (Jack Webb, soon to be better known for Dragnet).  Not all of the scenes revolve around Swanson, and the one where Holden and Olson play act a romantic scene at a party is intelligent, funny, and utterly charming.\n\nThe film gives us a behind the scenes look at Hollywood - brainstorming over scripts, the writing process, the vanity of those in the limelight, and the opulence.  Swanson gets a little over the top at times especially towards the end, but the film feels both sadly true, and yet also fantastical, with her mansion other-worldly and not unlike that of the one Miss Havisham has in 'Great Expectations', as Holden observes early on.  With such a setting and those poignant overtones, and having excellent direction, cinematography, script, and cast, it's hard to go wrong with this one.",

            "content": "Very few writer-directors even in the history of modern Hollywood have had the gumption to pull off the the kind of darkly powerful mainstream movies that Billy Wilder became famous for making in the 1940s and '50s. In such cases, your producer will only back you when he feels that even his commercial bone has to sometimes give way to the marrow of pure talent. After the sunnily sepulchral magnificence of 'Sunset Boulevard' , Wilder made \"Ace In The Hole\"  (1951) whose cynical dust seeps into the soul the deepest...and then maybe he couldn't take it any more, starting a late career comedic spree that truncated the intensifying greatness. But Sunset Boulevard is him at his zenith - a dirge about Hollywood in kaleidoscopic monochrome - plucking on multiple strings, deftly weaving through a succession of moods until the tragedy that blooms brighter than ever at the end isn't quite a Greek one , it's the exclusive exquisite hell of a Californian nightmare. \n\n\"You don't have the eat the whole jar of caviar to know it's good\", says Clifton Lawrence in Sidney Sheldon's seminal \"Stranger In The Mirror\". The first shot of Sunset Boulevard, promises of the focus to come, panning from a pavement over which the film's title is inscribed, to glide on, slowly and continuously, over the asphalt against which the opening credits roll, and over which presumably both wannabes and ageing have-beens get dragged over. \n\nA young film-writer, Joseph Gillis (embodied by William Holden), is in financial dire straits, his rent unpaid for three months, his pleas for help to agents and producers falling on slickly deaf ears, with hired musclemen out to confiscate his car for unresolved debts. Echoes from Wilder's preceding works pepper the start. The dialogue and mise en scene richly recall glorious pulp fiction  - Wilder had worked with Raymond Chandler in the pulpily magnificent \"Double Indemnity\" a few years earlier. A shot from the exterior, gliding into the upper windows of a building that houses Gillis's apartment reprises a similar one in \"Lost Weekend\". \n\nEscaping from the henchmen, he stumbles into the crumbling, commodious estate of Hollywood's Miss Havisham. There hides and seethes, a middle-aged yesteryear Hollywood superstar Norma Desmond (played by Gloria Swanson, herself a big star in the 1920s). Two decades ago she had the whole tinseltown eating out of her hands, but now she refuses to accept retirement. Alone and drunk on the ghosts of that fantastic past, she is doted upon by a mysteriously asssiduous butler (enacted by Eric Von Stroheim - a famous founding director and filmstar himself). Norma persudes Gillis to stay, asking him to fine-tune a come-back (Norma : \"I hate that word !\") script she's writing to essay her glorious return. He needs to survive, and she needs someone who can further her delusion and even someone whom she can manipulate romantically. A young lady (essayed with utterly guileless charm by Nancy Olson) comes along later, vying for Gillis's attention... and he soon realizes what sort of arcing odysseys Sunset Boulevard can take you on.  \n\nPic compendiates the best of Wilder's serious cinema. You see the sense of  confident clear framing and smooth dynamism that is the filmic equivalent of being in luxury lodgings. The famous reply Norma gives when told \"You used to big\" is smoothly covered in a shot that swiftly moves from medium-distance confab to marquee close-up ; Gilles goes to a see a producer for help, and the shot starts not with commonplace back-'n'-forth cutting, but with a focus on the cigar-lighting prosperous producer and then drawing back to reveal Gillis across the gulf on the other side of the table. The sharp nip and juiciness of dialogue never subsides - it is not highly sophisticated but 'tis healthy corn of the highest caliber. The mature steadily evolving screenplay does not mock your intelligence - note how the tone implacably shifts when a young lady visits a house late in the story (inverted years later in 'The Apartment'). Even in spoken style and mood as a unusual reflection of temperature, one can sense here a dry crackly crisp sense of Americanness - also evident in 'Lost Weekend' and 'Ace in the Hole' - as if you were walking by on a hot American summer day.\n\nSometimes that auteuristic confidence takes too much risks. Death is revealed at the start, as though Wilder dares to say 'Take this - I have shown you the unexpected ending right at the start', unshakeable in his belief that the moment-to-moment gravitas of the story will carry it through. It's a brave decision, but alas it upends what could have been a shocking turn of events at the end (cf. 'American Beauty'). \n\nBut that's only a minor gripe, and one of the joys of a superior screenplay like this, is how they richly populate their nooks and crannies where lesser works gape hollow between main scenes. As Gillis escapes the hoods, he drives by the cobbler and observes that the cobbler never judges you, he \"just looks at your heels and knows the score!\". Hollywood is serially skewered at the start with darting one-liners, culminating with a producer himself taking the hit - when he hears how another producer myopically let go of \"Gone with The Wind\", he confesses, \"No, that was me - I said, 'Who wants to see a film about the civil war ?!\" \n\nNone of the film's principals are introduced in movie-star style. Wilder reserves that honour for the iconic real life director Cecil B DeMille who plays himself in the movie. A phone call to the stage-set that a visitor is coming in to see him, has not one but two point of verbal relays , with only the third informed man in the chain of command, being able to go up to the venerable auteur himself to convey the message. We see a shot of DeMille from the back and then he turns sideways to reveal his face, surrounded as this cine monarch is by his courtiers - a subtly superb sequence overall. \nNorma comes to see him, palpitating under a misapprehension, hoping he'll make a big picture again with her, so that they will relive the glamorous achievements of the several previous films they'd made two decades ago. DeMille, unlike some top directors, is flawlessly natural and subtly nuanced  when it comes to emoting as an actor (he could easily embody a tough but wise and kind senior doctor), holding Norma's hand and being gently pampering towards her from start to finish, the scene doubly great because of their famous real-life director-heroine interactions from 1919 to 1921. \n\nThat sequence sports another beautiful moment, when a lighting man recognizes her and shines the spotlight upon her. It takes that artificial sun to make people notice her - murmurs spread - \"Look ! , There's  Ms.Desmond ! \" and the decades collapse in nostalgia as film personnel mill around this superstar from the past. \"Put that light back where it belongs\", Mr.DeMille firmly says, returning to disburse order on the set, the only one time that he is unkind in his words or behaviour to Norma who seems to have missed the jab. Her complacent delusion swirls unchecked - \"I don't care about the money!\" she remarks, when DeMille suggests it is going to be an expensive film, as though the producer is going to have the money raining down from the skies.  \n\nIn the film parlance of certain circles, there's the term \"double acting\", popular in the 60s and 70s, of a single actor portraying two separate characters in the same film. Gloria Swanson plays only one character here but she \"double-acts\". Her face contorts, eyes arc, cheeks tense, lips leer, hands are upflung in painting the grotesquerie of her tortured soul - the words merely reflect the Sturm und Drang already implicit in her expression. Swanson of course acts not just perfectly but also with time-transcending greatness - the role requires her to ham it up and she does so gloriously. It's a brand of exaggerated acting that artists were obliged to pull off in the centuries of stage dramas where quiet subtleties would be lost on physically far-away audiences, and in silent pictures perhaps where spoken dialogue was denied, but Norma keeps on doing this in her real life (interestingly, the one film reel we see of her youthful self shows tenderly subdued acting). \n\nHer middle-aged face shows vestiges of a sharp-featured beauty, and the voice though husky, has a core of constant steel, now corroded by hubristic obssession. Her mansion in which she exiles herself, afraid to venture out into the real world, is a large high-ceilinged aristocratic affair, just outside of which the grounds and pool and driveway lie in disrepair, just like how the disorder swirls around her passably kempt demeanour. Her personality ricochets between borderline to narcissictic to suicidal, with dangerous instability being the only constant. When Gillis honestly tells her that she is the only person in that whole town who was kind to him, we eventually figure out  what genre of kindness it actually was. Arriving after decades at the Paramount Pictures gate, she sees that the guard won't let her in, but an older one fondly recognizes her and gives access, but she does not say one word of \"Hi! or \"How are you?\" or a warm smile or even a tip  -  there's just \"open the gate\", and \"teach your friend some manners\".\nYou may want to sympathize with her when she is in her piteous throes, but when Holden nee Gillis flings his hands in superbly conveyed utter frustration and declares, \"There's nothing wrong in being 50, not unless you insist on being 25\", and the lady cannot internalize the wisdom of his words, you wonder not just about the depth of unfulfilled desire in this fifty year old lady, but also about whether there was any hint of this madness when she was twenty-five years old. \n\nNot for nothing was William Holden a leading star for two decades from the 1950s. At first his Joseph Gillis seems a run-of-the-mill character haplessly negotiating his pitiable fate but the role acquires more complexity as Gillis weighs how much longer he can subsist under a doting older lady. You can see the tension and the weight of decision simmering just under the skin of his face, silently erupting in a cold shower of dead smiles and complex manouevering when he eventually shows a visitor his deluxe current lodgings. \n\n Great works automatically inspire weak imposters, but a landmark like Sunset Boulevard inspires certain segments in works that are great by themselves. Mario Puzo's iconic novel \"The Godfather\" has an floridly explicit sequence of a dethroned Hollywood queen similarly watching projected movies in her house while taking it much lower by sexually satisfying herself in the basest of ways with a younger man. Sidney Sheldon's magnum opus \"The Stranger In The Mirror\" has a sub-plot about a yesteryear founding father of the industry who now roils in pitiable shame and rage, desperate for a Hollywood that is gone even before the wind. \n\nAt one point in the finale, I had a faint doubt whether Sunset Boulevard was truly a masterpiece, but then a dark starburst erupts, when a director inside a director's film takes charge to breathe new life into an exit that seemed dead in the water. It's a man never letting go of pampering his love one last time, just as an artist will never stop blending nightmares and dreams into a swirling demi-monde. You can always count on auteurs to shine a shaft of salvaging light when the darkness is closing in all around. \n\nUPN",

Watching 'Sunset Boulevard' is like a frightening trip into madness, exhilarating and astoundingly rich. The film also draws an acerbic portrait of two Hollywoods; the first one being the faded, forgotten, ghostly Hollywood of Norma, the second one the penniless but inspired Hollywood of Joe. A contrast made more vivid by the facially expressive acting of Gloria Swanson (true silent film star), in rupture with Holden's much more spontaneous portrayal of Joe (obviously  coming from a different age).

She's over-the-top, but not in the kind of way that's tolerable. She's selfish, and whiny, and conceited. It's the kind of thing that almost ruins an otherwise excellent movie.\n\nAnd then you understand. That's the point. Billy Wilder's take on a darker side of Hollywood is scathing and unrelenting, showing how fame takes its toll on those \"fortunate\" enough to reach movie star status. Behind the camera, the screenwriters (in this case, down-on-his-luck writer Joe Gillis) are too cynical to craft anything more than an easy buck. To boot, it's all strangely meta: Gloria Swanson, giving one of the most legendary performances in history as Desmond, transitions from silent film actress into a new era of filmmaking, not unlike Desmond hopes to do herself. Wilder is wildly inventive in this regard, and doesn't pull punches when going directly after the business. Instead of making up directors to include in this story, he throws in real names (D.W. Griffith and Cecil DeMille, the latter of whom cameos in a small acting role) to make this savage satire hit as hard as it can. Wilder and Charles Brackett's screenplay draws elements of film noir mysteries, with voiceover narration and murky cinematography, but it's also truly funny. It's that kind of juxtaposition that makes Sunset Boulevard such a masterwork of film: you can't help but laugh at how these things play out and how ridiculous they all can be, but they sit in the corner of your mind and slowly register. And again, you understand. This is very much a horror story.",

            "content": "This is an unfolding experience; the fate is set, we know William Holden will die and his narration is otherworldly, from the afterlife presumably.  So the challenge is always: can we care about a story whose results we already know?  It's Shakespeare's witches on a beach, prophetic, moving in one direction.  We only need one look at Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond - set in a rotting mansion amidst stacks of obsessively writing an epic screenplay that nobody will buy - to know that Holden is falling into a trap with a completely insane woman.  I don't know enough movies to say whether or not this really stood out for it's time, exposing the inner world of Hollywood glamour and the hard hit for those who fall from it.  But I can say that every beat of this film unfolds to my taste, and it's statement of Hollywood holds true to today.  Holden's Joe Gillis is trapped in Dracula's castle, his meat tenderizing to her whims, her every need, and eventually her desire to have a man like him in her life.  Here's a young, good-looking stud whose screenwriting career is failing, and out of desperation he allows himself to be taken by this old washup.  We get a sense of both Gillis and Desmond's desperation playing off into their inevitable pitfall.  Gillis could have a younger, attractive, successful woman like Barbara Schaefer, who is helping him recuperate his career with a screenplay that could actually land him a quality film.  She is his only hope, his one way ticket out of hell into a better life.  But he's in a bubble with her, dancing on the outskirts, seeing what could've been if his devlish functions weren't so manipulated by the more immediate lavish life Desmond provides.  \n\nWilder stages this with delicacy, but is not shy to allow over-the-top moments, particularly by Swanson giving us the ugliest side of fallen stardom one could imagine.  From her facelift to her close-up moment after the murder, we get all we could hope to keep reserved in the belly of our deepest nightmares of lost minds and past-dwelling.  \n\nI only wonder if this film feels very removed from those who don't know Hollywood lingo, which dialogue and narration provide an abundance of.  Featuring legendary director Cecil B DeMille as himself may not register with the modern audience, but it's significant.  He entertains Desmond, horribly and accidentally teasing that her screenplay has any promise, only to reveal the sad truth that he had no other way of handling her politely, and has no intention of making her movie.  \n\nThe narration is another great tool, providing the attitude and backdrop of being a screenwriter in Hollywood, not taking from the theatric experience of the story coming to life visually.  Sunset Boulevard itself will fatefully be the best story Gillis ever tells on film.  Desmond's heartbreak is unsettling, unnerving, and an effective lesson about moving on in life.",

            "content": "As part of the 'First Thursday of Every Month' Classics, I took a stroll down Sunset Boulevard and revisited an old friend, whose star has faded-like the once glistening pavement now marred by the passage of time.\n\n...I'm talking about Norma Desmond.\n\nShe once was a silent-picture actress who used to be big. Though she'd defiantly tell you...\n\n    \"I am big. It's the pictures that got small.\" - by Norma Desmond\n\nAnd so we witness the mental breakdown of a woman trapped in a past she could never go back to; after all, movies have words now.\n\nThere's so much about this movie that is brilliant, including this one shot of Norma visiting the studio. A microphone passes overhead and gently bumps into her, sort of like a nudge, reminding her of something she angrily wants to forget... She is no longer a star and she never will be again.\n\nIt's something that many can relate to albeit in a different way, without the cameras and such. Like working in a job until one day technology has gotten so that your skill is no longer required or you have someone become outdated, making you feel as if you're being left to pasture.\n\nA stranger comes a knocking\n\nOur window into Norma's world is seen through the eyes of a man who comes to her house. Joe Gillis finds himself unable to get through to her or unwilling to waste his time trying...\n\n    \"You don't yell at a sleepwalker - he may fall and break his neck. That's it: she was still sleepwalking along the giddy heights of a lost career.\" - by Joe Gillis\n\n\n(some spoilers)\n\nJoe is a broke screenwriter, who's creditors are knocking. But without a screenplay that anyone wants to buy, he finds himself at her doorstep.\n\nShe's wealthy and he can smell the money from her estate, which houses just her and her man servant, Max. Thinking he's got one over on her, Joe convinces her to offer him a job to work on a screenplay that would be her comeback. But ultimately, he plays into her hands.\n\nAnd so we watch as he ends up trapped in her web with a dark cloud blanketing him. He can't seem to free himself.\n\nBut why does he stay?\nIt's the question that makes sense when watching the film. He's has no money. And aside from a few friends, he doesn't seem to have much else in Hollywood. As so he believes he only has two options: stay there with her or go back to his small town home and start a new life.\n\nThough, I think there's something deeper. Her life is one of solitude and being around her taps into a similar feeling. It borders on a psychological issue for him. A sense of helplessness that festers into anger. Anger at himself and in Norma for being Norma. She can't help who she is because she's sick. And every minute he stays with her, makes him sick as well.\n\nUntil he sees a friend...\nBetty represents the light. A wannabe screenwriter, who reminds him of how he used to be-filled with life and hope.\n\nSunset Boulevard is a compelling, yet tragic tale of two people who get what they want in the harshest way possible. Joe is part of the larger than life story and Norma gets to be in front of the cameras once more.\n\nScore: 10/10\nhttps://thelastwordstanding.blogspot.com/",

Joe Gillis, a down on his luck screenwriter, happens upon the one-time Hollywood Gem Norma Desmond who sees Gillis as a way to relaunch her flagging film-career.  Hollywood Boulevard brilliantly portrays the harsh and brutal nature of Hollywood.  It is pathetic seeing Norma Desmond, sitting in the dark watching her old films, but it is also poignant and sad too.  She was once a massive Hollywood star, but now everybody has even forgotten that she existed.  To be launched into fame and then to have this fame taken away from you would be difficult to deal with for anyone let alone a has-been actress like Norma Desmond.\n\nRead my full review here: http://goo.gl/GpaqvS",

However, Sunset Boulevard tends to be a undecided on what specific genre it is and what storylines actually matter.\nJoe Gillis is a down on his luck film screenwriter whose car breaks down in the mansion of has been silent film actress Norma Desmond and her constantly serious and sometimes cryptic butler Max. Norma guarantees free housing and money if Joe writes her a script for a film she's been planning to give to Cecil B. DeMille for years. As time goes by, Joe learns first hand the chilling effects of Norma's obsessive crave for attention, going first suicidal and eventually homicidal in her trek to have cameras on her at all times, ruining Joe's newfound relationship with a coworker and her own acting career.\nSunset Boulevard is amazingly done for its time. A story so compelling and with such fascinating characters like Norma Desmond seemed somewhat uncommon in the early 1950s. It is a cryptic and a playful, almost symbollic like look on the film business, Norma craving for constant attention and doing whatever she can to boost her ego. Studying up on the film briefly after viewing it, I found it to be extremely clever that the film is somewhat of an exaggerated play on Gloria Swanson's own silent film career. The film does occasionally tend on having trouble where to go for certain parts - the introduction and end to our character Betty Schaefer seemed like an odd path to go on, the relationship between Betty and Joe being dissolved quickly after making it so major. One comment of note is the film uses a notable use of main character narration - this annoyed me at first but I found it to be helpful to delve into our protagonist as the film went on. Sunset Boulevard is still an amazing film and one of the true classic gems of film, being one of the key films to feed off of its own business and being unique enough to, especially at its time, do it so elegantly.",

What most intrigued me was the story of Norma Desmond's addiction to fame, and her struggle with obscurity. It's a truly tragic film, and I think it's still a relevant issue today for celebrities. While I liked the performances of William Holden and Nancy Olsen, this movie is all about Gloria Swanson's brilliantly over-the-top acting. I kept waiting to see what would happen next and, because of the flashback story-telling, the eventual shooting is like a ticking stopwatch adding tension to most of the scenes. I also really appreciated the strange nature of Norma Desmond's world and how the puzzle pieces are slowly revealed to us. Finally, Sunset Boulevard is a great example of how to use voice-over in order to enhance your film. They use it merely for set-up and framing of certain scenes, but never waste our time with needless exposition in the narration. All that being said, I didn't love Sunset Boulevard. Norma Desmond, while a unique character to explore, is a very toxic personality and a bit hard to take for long periods of time. Also, I was a bit frustrated throughout (knowing that Joe would never have his happy ending) which I guess is the one downside to showing us the end at the beginning. Yet I can see why this is a classic, and I am glad I finally know what it's all about.",

He didn't know the madness he was getting himself involved in, and neither did the audience.\n\nThere are so many examples of great cinematic storytelling in this film, and we can even see this at the very beginning of the film. There are transitions that follow the on-screen movement to give these transitions a sense of continuity in how the story progresses. The many dissolves at the start of the film convey this same idea. Once we get to Norma Desmond's estate there is a tracking shot following Gillis along the hedges and then backing up to get a good view of the entire estate, and it is a glorious shot.\n\nGillis' reflection on Desmond and her lifestyle create the sense of an unreliable narrator, though we can believe some of it. He says she is introverted, and we see this without difficulty by the mise-en- scene: she surrounds herself with pictures of herself, she refuses to hear criticism for her awful scripts, and she even watches her own silent films. She simply cannot move on from the days of silent cinema in which she was still relevant, and the inclusion of sound has not treated this decaying actress well; there is even an instance when she is in a studio and gets hit by a microphone, and it is clear by her face that this device is alien to her.\n\nThe first time I viewed this film I was 16 and did not like the fact that Desmond gets away with murder at the end (I didn't realize she would probably be sent to a mental institution). Though I still don't like this fact, this film is a great tragedy combined with the best of film-noir, and it is a very eerie feeling at the film's conclusion since Desmond is completely out of her mind - she has lost herself in unreality. This film intrigues me with questions I still ask myself which makes me want to keep coming back to this masterpiece filled with so much content underneath its form.",

There is nothing so depressing as an aging woman who is stuck in her 20's and to have it all and have it thrown away with time. This movie reminded me of an older women I've met who was very miserable and stuck in her small famous past. The mansion was incredibly beautiful but also terribly vacant, decrepit, and lonely. It just shows money and fame doesn't=happiness, in fact it's more depressing if you have all that and aren't happy.

Gloria Swanson plays fantastically the role of Norma Desmond, an ambitious old actress of Hollywood who desire fame again, trying to do another film, with the help of the desesperate writer Joe Gillis, played by William Holden. With a great cast, a great story and a great directing, the ambitious and talented vision of Billy Wilder transformed this film in one of the great classics of all time!",

An aging silent era star who hires a down on his luck writer to edit her big \"comeback\" script. William Holden and Gloria Swanson are the primary focus and are both fantastic. I cannot say enough positive things about this film, it is tremendous.\n\nIf you enjoy classic cinema and have not seen \"Sunset Blvd\" drop everything and watch it immediately!!!",

            "content": "Ever since film became a widely-spread medium, filmmakers have turned the camera on themselves or the industry that produced them. There is a rich pantheon of films about cinema, and about Hollywood in particular, ranging from the satire of Robert Altman's The Player and the mystery of Mulholland Drive to much ropier efforts like Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? and An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn.\n\nAll of these examples, however, owe some kind of debt to two films released in 1950, both of which revolve around the mental frailty of fading actresses. One of these films was All About Eve, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's captivating melodrama with a barnstorming performance by Bette Davis. The other was Sunset Boulevard, the first of many triumphs that would befall Billy Wilder in this decade.\n\nWhile Sunset Boulevard has become almost universally admired, Wilder's approach is very different to most other directors who have dabbled in this area. Works like Vertigo, Peeping Tom and 8 1/2 are deeply auteurist: they are very consciously the product of a singular vision, with the film being shaped and driven by the director's personal relationship to the medium.\n\nWilder's approach, on the other hand, is much more understated. Throughout his career he deliberately eschewed the techniques of conscious imagery employed by Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles, believing that it distracted from the material. For Wilder, a film began not with the director's vision, but with the script and the characters that flowed from it. Perhaps this is why his work is more celebrated in film circles than among the wider public: everyone knows the imagery of Hitchcock, while few could name three of Wilder's films of equal quality.\n\nSunset Boulevard was once described by film critic Richard Corliss as \"the definitive Hollywood horror movie\", and it isn't hard to see why. There is a ghoulish, almost Gothic feel to the cinematography, similar to what Hitchcock achieved on Rebecca but with a greater emphasis on decay and the grotesque. John F. Seitz had worked with Wilder on The Lost Weekend and Double Indemnity, and reutilised a trick he developed on the latter picture: before every take he sprinkled some dust in front of the camera to give the impression of mustiness.\n\nAside from the visuals, the horror aspects are also reflected in the plot. Sunset Boulevard is famously narrated from beyond the grave, taking the film noir device of the unreliable narrator and making it seem all the more disembodied. The film begins and ends with the recovery of a corpse, and when Joe Gillis first arrives at Norma Desmond's house, he is mistaken for the undertaker. The whole story is about characters barely clinging onto life, with both Gillis and Desmond in great danger of being swept away by new, younger, better talents.\n\nWhile the horror aspects draw out the similarities between the characters, Wilder also uses the language of film noir to illustrate their differences, particularly their stylistic ones. Gloria Swanson's character is preening and melodramatic, while William Holden is more naturalistic; they form two different reactions to the underlying atmosphere of cynicism and desperation that film noir does so well. But while the differences are played up, the film never becomes a pantomime, and like on Double Indemnity the narrative is never overbearing or excessive.\n\nSunset Boulevard has a number of fascinating themes and ideas, all of which are realised in a substantial yet tantalising way. One of its main ideas is the heartlessness of Hollywood, a business built upon glamour that rarely lives up to its reputation. It's a place that turns ambition into world-weariness, success into mausoleums, and shows no mercy regardless of whether you're a penniless writer or an insanely rich (and just plain insane) star of yesteryear. Ultimately, everyone's fate is the same: abandonment, emptiness and death, and we have little control over any of these.\n\nThis theme is reinforced by the intimidating architecture, utilising the same sort of technique that Roman Polanski would later apply in his Apartment Trilogy. Even without the Gothic visuals, Desmond's house is an unnerving place to be, with people always being shot in middle- or long-distance so that they look tiny against the staircase, doors and columns. The titular street is almost personified in the opening shot, bringing an eerie, ever-present stillness to an ever-changing world.\n\nThe film is also very interested in the fleeting nature of fame, epitomised by Desmond's famous remark: \"I am big! It's the pictures that got small\". There's a fantastic scene about halfway through where Desmond has shown up on Cecil B. De Mille's set, and a spotlight happens to fall on her. While the spotlight is on her, people recognise, crowd round and adore her - but then the director orders it away and the movers and shakers move on. It's a beautifully sad metaphor, realised cinematically through an unfussy but meaningful gesture - that really is Wilder in a nutshell.\n\nThere's also a minor comment in the film about the rivalry or rift caused by the introduction of sound. Desmond's comments about faces being replaced by endless talking make an interesting point about changes in acting styles, and how technological changes can lead to art forms being lost. While The Artist approaches this issue in an optimistic manner, arguing that there is room for every kind of style of filmmaking, the characters in Sunset Boulevard have very little to hope for.\n\nThe film also deals with the issue of madness, offering a number of explanations for Desmond's mental state. Rather than simply under-write her as non-specifically senile, the film explores how her madness may spring from a fear of abandonment, arguing that such attitudes are an inevitable product of the star system, where people are raised up and then quickly forgotten. Equally, her dismissive attitude towards the \"mediocre\" talent of the day presents a different position - that madness is the product of obsessive nostalgia, and that insanity results from failing to embrace change.\n\nOn top of all its richly-layered themes, the film is a self-reflexive treat in terms of its casting. Aside from the brilliant central performances by Holden and Swanson, it boasts a supporting cast of Hollywood greats playing themselves (or versions thereof). Erich von Stroheim, who worked with Swanson on the ill-fated Queen Kelly, channels into his character all the humiliations he had suffered at the hands of Hollywood studios. Buster Keaton looks as melancholy as ever as one of Swanson's \"waxworks\", and Cecil B. DeMille remains deeply powerful, even without his iconic jodphurs.\n\nSunset Boulevard is a truly great film with a wealth of fascinating ideas, which remains one of the greatest films ever made about Hollywood. While Mulholland Drive and Peeping Tom are ultimately more mesmerising, it is still an all-round triumph with a great script, a fantastic cast and inspired direction from Wilder. It is essential viewing for anyone interested who is interested in Hollywood - in other words, it's essential viewing for everyone.",

            "content": "\"Alright, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.\"\n\nGenerally, when a film is made about Hollywood, then the famed city is depicted as a happy place filled with happy people. In Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, however, we witness the story of a fallen star and craziness about returning to the screen. Sunset Boulevard is creepy, creepy, and very creepy... but creepy in an excellent way, and this is the same Billy Wilder who made Some Like it Hot.\n\nThe film begins where we meet Joe Gillis (William Holden), a broke Hollywood screenwriter who is itching to make money and get a job. When he falls behind on his car payments, he is pursued by repo men, but a flat tire lands him in the mansion of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a former and mostly forgotten silent film star who wants to make a comeback (\"Don't say that word. I'm making a return.\"). She has Gillis make a screenplay about herself and intends to make a new film with her favorite director, Cecil B. DeMille (played by himself), and in the process, starts to fall in love with Gillis. Even more complicated is Gillis's relationship with the younger female screenwriter, Betts Schaefer (Nancy Olson), who's already engaged to another man. Things get crazy and Desmond goes suicidal.\n\nAlso, Erich von Stroheim plays Max, Desmond's servant who's faithful to her commands.\n\nSunset Boulevard, in my opinion, is brilliant. Simply brilliant. This is one of the most original films I've seen in my life, more original than films released today, in a time that's more focused on remakes and sequels. The fact that the film is narrated by a dead man in a pool makes the film more original and creepy. Many people describe Sunset Boulevard as a dark comedy, but I didn't see anything funny about it. Instead, I was treated to a brilliant, creepy, dark, thrilling, chilling, and wonderfully made thrilling drama.\n\nGloria Swanson plays Norma Desmond, the faded silent star to perfection. She's creepy, disturbing, and a maniac. The scene where she makes out with the screen writer is just sick, but sick in a way that wowed me in the suspense. Even creepier than Swanson is Erich von Stroheim as the creepy butler. His character had more twists than Desmond and is just simply chilling. As for William Holden? He's magnificent in the role, and was wonderfully cast as the screenwriter. \n\nThe black-and-white cinematography is simply outstanding. It's hard to imagine the film in color, as colorizing the film would ruin the film's creepiness. In scenes with the butler, the dark mood and creepiness makes the cinematography sand out. In the final shot with Swanson's  \"close-up\", the black-and-white makes that shot that much creepier and ends the film on a chilling note.\n\nFranz Waxman composed the score for this chilling film. Waxman is known for scoring creepy films, such as Bride of Frankenstein and Hitchcock's Rebecca, and in Sunset Boulevard, the creepiness and eerie mood adds more thrilling chills in Sunset Boulevard that you'd think that the film was made by Alfred Hitchcock himself.\n\nFor a film directed by the man behind Some Like it Hot, Sunset Boulevard is a chilling thrill ride, with marvelous performances, incredible black-and-white cinematography, possibly the most original story you'll ever see in Hollywood film, and a chilling score. I'm glad I saw this film and I hope more newcomers to classic films will watch this too.\n\n\"Without me, there wouldn't be any Paramount studio.\"",

From what starts off as an easy-to-follow film noir piece, it slowly turns into a jacked-up love story.  Just as Gillis references in the film itself, the character of Norma feels just like Ms. Havisham from Charles Dicken's Great Expectations.  She is the old woman who can not forgive Hollywood for forgetting her as she aged and she plans to take it out on anyone who she can suck into her pit of despair (namely Gillis).  The story intrigued me at the beginning with the murder, but as it moved along and I saw it was about a crazy old actress who becomes obsessed with a much younger screenwriter, I was let down.  Chinatown and On the Waterfront are 2 noir films on the AFI Top 100 list that lived up to the crime noir feel, but Sunset Boulevard went a little nuts, just like its lead actress.  I can't say this movie was a \"bad\" film, but it is for a unique movie watcher and only a handful of people can cheer over this strange story.  Take a look, see for yourself.

Do I agree with all this acclaim? Honestly, yes. It is the best movie about movies ever made.\r\n\r\nThere have been some great movies about movies released recently. Hugo and The Artist are two wonderful movies. But what makes Sunset Boulevard better than these movies? It's not in love with Hollywood. Sure Hugo and The Artist are great movies, but the end result of both is to make the audience agree that Hollywood is just the most wonderful place.  What makes Sunset Boulevard so terrific is that it sees through the Hollywood tinsel. The movie paints Hollywood as the glamorous place that it is, but it also shows that none if it is real. The majority of people in the world realize this, but Norma Desmond doesn't.\r\n\r\nWe meet Joe Gillis, a penniless, prospect-less screenwriter. When eluding the men sent to repossess his car, Joe hides it in a seemingly abandoned garage. The garage is connected to a rundown mansion. Much to Joe's surprise, he is called into the mansion. There he meets retired silent movie actress Norma Desmond. After deciding not to transition to talking pictures, Norma has lived in the mansion for years. When she finds out that Joe is a screenwriter, she immediately offers him a job. She has written an enormous script for a movie about Salome, which she thinks will vault her back into movie stardom. She convinces Joe to live in her mansion, and edit her script. She assumes she will star in the movie, and old friend Cecil B. DeMille will direct. Joe doesn't really want to stay with Norma, but he needs the job and the shelter. The story twists from there.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the movie so brilliant is the parallels between the movie and reality. Star Gloria Swanson's life corresponding quite a bit with her character Norma. Erich von Stroheim's character Max is very much like him. von Stroheim actually directed Swanson in some of her earlier movies, just like his character. Other similarities between life and movie abound.\r\n\r\nBut it's not only the parallels that make this movie great, the storytelling, direction, and script are all really exceptional. The fact that the movie is narrated by a dead character is innovative. The whole story is such a fresh way to tell a noir murder mystery. To have a crazed, washed up movie star be your main character is bold. The script is also filled with great lines, wit, and drama.\r\n\r\nGloria Swanson has a way of completely embodying her character Norma in a way that I have never seen from an actor before. It helps that Swanson didn't really do much after this movie, and that I've never seen any of her other movies. She is wholly convincing in the role, a role that requires a good deal of tight-rope walking to be believable in. I am not hesitant to say that this is one of the best performances I have seen in a classic movie.\r\n\r\nWilliam Holden gets overlooked more than he should in his role as Joe Gillis. He turns in a very solid performance that completely holds up against Swanson's more memorable one. The one thing I didn't like about that this movie is his character's actions though. If I were him, I would have turned tail and gotten out of Norma's mansion well before it was too late.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast doesn't have a weak link. Erich von Stroheim gives a good, if un-intrusive performance as Max. The character is vital to the story and the performance works. Nancy Olson is sweet and innocent as Betty Schaefer, Joe's conscience in the story. She personifies everything Joe wants in life. Also, look for Cecil B. DeMille playing himself in a very well done cameo.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this is one of the very best classic movies you'll see. And it was when watching this movie that I realized that the same can be said for a lot of Billy Wilder movies. The diversity of the exceptional movies that Wilder directed is astounding: Double Indemnity, Witness for the Prosecution, and The Apartment are just a sampling of his fantastic work. As for Sunset Boulevard, it is not only one of Wilder's best, but it's also one of Hollywood's best.\r\n\r\n \"There's nothing else. Just us, and the cameras, and those wonderful people out there in the dark. All right, Mr. De Mille, I'm ready for my closeup.\" 10/10",

It's the pictures that got small.\n\n\"A Hollywood Story\"\n\nSunset Boulevard is one of those timeless classics that every film buff must see in their lifetime. It's some of Billy Wilder's best works and only the second film of his I've seen, the other being, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, which is considered to be one of his lesser efforts. So it was nice to see Wilder at the top of his game, and was he ever. Sunset Boulevard is a masterpiece, there's absolutely no doubt about that.\n\nA struggling screenwriter named Joe Gillis stumbles on what he thinks to be an old abandoned Hollywood stars home while running from repossessors who want his car. When the home isn't actually abandoned, but actually occupied by an aging silent film star, Norma Desmond. Norma is delusional, self absorbed, and downright crazy. She is trying to stage a comeback with a screenplay she has been working on for years and asks Joe to edit it. He agrees thinking it will be some nice, quick cash. The stay on Sunset Boulevard doesn't happen to be as brief as he thought though.\n\nThe performances from William Holden and Gloria Swanson are phenomenal. The story is great, no matter what you want to call it; a film noir, a character study, whatever, it's fantastic. There's a lot of dark material, but the writing manages to allow for some comedic moments. The house is almost another character altogether and an amazing setting for a film.\n\nSunset Boulevard is a must see film. Film lovers will love the movie driven story, fantastic performances and great direction. It's one of the few movies that will be well known forever and never forgotten. A complete masterpiece.",

Absolutely brilliant acting! Just a fantastic treat to watch every single moment of her on the screen. One of the greatest performances on film, ever!\r\n\r\nWilliam Holden's performance is also very good. Who could play opposite Swanson while more than holding his own and that is certainly Holden. His self- sickened character who is badly in need of cash ends up prostituting himself & paying the ultimate price for his choices. Holden really is not given enough credit for how truly marvelous his performance is.\r\n\r\nMax...then there is the undying loyalty of Max. Norma Desmond's dedicated butler who is played to perfection by Erich Von Stroheim. Max's charcter would fit right into a 1950's horror film just as easily as he does in this film. He is the creepy over obsessed, over dedicated servant to the great Norma Desmond and Von Stronheim is simply brilliant.\r\n\r\nOf course the film is directed & co-written by the very great Billy Wilder who made some of the greatest films ever made. Arguably this may be Wilder's finest effort, a masterful work in every way & for a film lover, pure bliss to watch. Pure bliss!\r\n\r\n \"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.\"",

From the very beginning he finds her eccentric and her mansion chilling. All the same he agrees to live there in order to edit her movie script and earn some much needed money. Soon she grows accustomed and dependent on him since her only other companion is a butler. Hoping to make a comeback she goes to director Cecil B.

At the same time the young writer begins to distance himself as he begins to fall for a young woman writer he has been working for.
