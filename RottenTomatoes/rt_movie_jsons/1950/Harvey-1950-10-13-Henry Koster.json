            "content": "I'm half-convinced that Jimmy Stewart orchestrated a multi-decade deception convincing people that he was constantly followed by an invisible, six-foot tall rabbit companion, all so he could order two martinis at a time at the bar. Shoutout to the bartender, the most supportive of Dowd's 'delusion', who gets an extra patron out of the bargain.\n\nHarvey is like a Capra film, but with the completely untempered optimism and excessively unlikely plotlines replaced with something that feels much more human despite its fantastical nature. Mary Chase's Pultizer Prize-winning play transforms a situational comedy into a heartfelt story of friendship and love, one that prizes small character interactions and how they can kindle close emotional connections with the right amount of kindness. Characters are very ably transported from their droll, monotonous (yet oh-so-respectable) existences to an in-the-moment frame of mind, all based on interactions with a fantastical being that may or may not exist, leaving open the possibility that it was simply the spark of geniality that let such sweet moments take place. Led by a Jimmy Stewart performance that takes advantage of his endearing cadence and careful emotional control, Harvey is a triumph of generosity in an otherwise gray world. With the delusions, exasperated characters, and plot that dangles disaster in front of our protagonist, I'm surprised that nobody made a twisted, horror version of this in the '90s (except, maybe that's what Donnie Darko is). \n\nAnd here's a nice midcentury cinematic threat to keep in your back pocket: \"One more peep outta you, weisenheimer, and I'll butter your necktie.\" Be sure to throw that one out at your next bar brawl.

Wow, that nurse at that Sanitarium is banging. \n\nSo this Harvey is actually not a friend of Elwood but instead is haunting him. Damn, that Myrtle Turtle girl is desperate to find a guy.  Holy shit, that painting depicting Elwood and Harvey was pretty haunting. That rabbit doesn't look cute of goofy or funny at all. \n\nGreat acting all around. Elwood is such a charming and good hearted person which is something not really associated with someone who thinks he has an imaginary 6 foot tall rabbit as a friend. What a turn of events once we see doors start to open by themselves and the doctor say that he's being followed. \n\nI can see Donnie Darko is definitely inspired by this movie. This movie is deeper than what I took from it. It seems like there's more to this movie than what's on the surface. I feel like I have to give it another watch. There's so many questions I still have. People start to see Harvey after what? Why did Harvey choose Elwood? Because he was so frequent on the booze?",

            "content": "\"In this world, you must be oh so smart, or oh so pleasant.  Well, for years I was smart.  I recommend pleasant.\"  So says Elwood P. Dowd (Jimmy Stewart), a character who combines the gentle temperament of the Dalai Lama with the martini intake of Frank Sinatra.  He also seems a bit crazy, seeing as his pal is an invisible 6'3 1/2\" rabbit named Harvey, and happily introduces him to everyone he meets.  While he seems harmless, his sister (Josephine Hull) wants to commit him to a sanitarium, and in a comedy of errors, gets locked up herself.  From there it's a series of screwball moments, with the hospital staff trying to track down Elwood, and him oblivious to it all.\n\nThe film is a little bit of indictment of the mental health industry, with one doctor (Lyman Sanderson) jumping to harebrained conclusions and an orderly (Jesse White) aggressively putting his hands on people.  He alludes to having had to take the corset off of Hull's character while stripping her, a fact that intrigues her daughter (Victoria Horne), in one creepy and awkward scene.  Horne at 39 was far too old for the role (Jimmy Stewart, playing her uncle, was 42), and scenes with her and White are the low points of the film.  \n\nIf it seems like just another goofball comedy in the first half, stay with it and let Elwood Dowd's benevolence sink in.  He engages everyone he meets in real conversation, cares about them, and almost always invites them over to his house for dinner or for drinks.  He does that not out of politeness, but actually wants and expects them to show up.  The character is quite endearing, and Stewart's performance is nuanced and brilliant.  In this screwball comedy, there is a real message of the importance of simple kindness, and it's delivered in a subtle way.",

While his performance is completely endearing, I was delighted to find it was the supporting cast that delivered the bulk of the comedic moments. Stewart plays it pretty straight which is actually crucial for his character (who thinks a giant invisible rabbit is perfectly normal.) But actors like Cecil Kellaway, Charles Drake, and especially Josephine Hull are completely stymied by this rabbit. It's to the point where they can't even make up their own minds on whether it's real or not. \n\nThe comedy in Harvey is very situational, which I enjoy, but it seemed there were not a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. I think I expected a more screwball style to the humor, but it didn't quite get there. In fact, there are some moments in Harvey that are totally serious. They are having genuine discussions about what makes someone crazy, and asking if crazy is bad if they aren't hurting anyone. It also feels like the movie answers the question of whether Harvey is real or not, and I think I would have preferred if it was left ambiguous. It wasn't a problem, just one thing that might have worked better for me if they went the other way.\n\nThe story of Harvey is not a complicated one, in fact much of it I was able to surmise from merely watching a few clips that I've seen in pop culture. You can sense the origins of the script, because the film feels exactly like a stage play. There aren't many sets or locations, and they seem to return to the same places again and again. It was in danger, at times, of feeling repetitive because so much of the movie seemed to center on finding one person or another that has disappeared. However, I never got to the point of being annoyed or bored by Harvey. It's an entertaining little film, and it's one I'd gladly watch again anytime.",

Like many studio comedies, the supporting cast is an embarrassment of riches.",

The central premise works, but the film spends way too much time having Dowd explain the already simple central conceit to other characters, resulting in long dead-patches. Additionally, the script gets bogged down in contrivances that come off as though they were written with an end point in mind and, as a result, the progression doesn't feel natural. If the game of escalating misunderstandings is done well, it appears effortless and Harvey often feels labored in its attempt to move pieces from point A to point B. It's sweet and charming, but this is a minor work. Its status as a classic doesn't seem to hold up under further scrutiny.",

The play does not carry over well to the big screen as it were, so you feel like you are watching a play, which is fine. Jimmy Stewart hams his way through the hour and 30 minutes worth of running time as he pretends to actually be corresponding with a giant, invisible white rabbit where the actual giant, white rabbit in the room that no one actually sees is the fact that this movie is fun for 40 minutes and dies tragically in the last half. Josephine Hull won an Oscar for her role, a freaking Oscar. Did the Academy pull an all night booze fest and teetotal their way into this vote?\n\nThere are a few interesting notes of dialogue, but this movie is one of those James Stewart \"classics\" that is not very good.  Mr. Stewart had the acting range of a wet boot, and his voice is so grading that listening to him deliver his folksy, whimsical advice makes me want to punch him square in the mouth. That is coming from someone who likes a few of his films.\n\nThe movie suffers from its scenes being disconnected and from too much acting that is representative of sophomores in high school trying to work their way through a one act play. Only here the one act is Stewart and his rabbit, one that should have been pulled out of the hat early on so that the magician could take a bow. Believe me when I say that Stewart is quite the wizard as he has put the entire film industry in a trance with his hokey films.\n\nI leave you with the line that sums up the film best:\n\nWilson: \"Is he alone?\"\n\nMr. Cracker the Bartender: \"Well, there's two schools of thought, sir.\"\n\nMy school of thought is that he is not alone because multiple people would have us believe that Harvey is a real, tangible treat to encounter.

At the beginning, it makes you think \"no, I don't want to have anything to do with this 'crazy' man\" But as the film goes by, and we meet Elwood (and Harvey) through the eyes of multiple people with different opinions and also their similar stand on the situation \"we need to 'cure' him.\" But at the same time, we agree, \"he's a sweet, sweet man.\"\n\nOne of my favorite things about Elwood's character is his personification of Harvey as an aid to other people's worries: \"He's bigger than anything they carry\" or something to that effect. Specificity aside, the quote is sensible and sentimentalist, one that I would say represents the heart of the film.\n\nAnother aspect I love about this film is Josephine Hulls' performance; she's a sweet, dignified lady whose acting style fit the movie's mood perfectly and trailblazed the appeal for the rest of the characters.\n\nIt's an interesting mix of fantasy and reality, and it did keep my attention throughout.

It has something to do with childhood wonder, naivet\u00e9, and simple kindness - three qualities that can sum up James Stewart's career. This was surely the role he was born to play. Harvey reaffirms the advice the fox gives the little prince when he said, \"What is most essential is invisible to the eye.\" It manages to achieve the same kind of message and warmth that such works as Calvin and Hobbes, Pinnochio, Toy Story, and E.T had on me as a kid. And notice that all those works are either animated or rely on special effects to accomplish its wonder/fantasy element. This movie (1951) does so entirely by means of James Stewart's lovable, bright, sunny performance as Elwood P. Dowd. I have seen the film a few times now and I swear that with each new viewing, I am able to see that big white rabbit more and more.",

            "content": "I have read that James Stewart considered Elwood P. Dowd his most personally significant role. In a career that spanned decades and included such great works at It's a Wonderful Life and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, choosing Harvey's friend, Elwood, as his personal favorite says something about rather powerful about Mr. Stewart and Mr. Dowd.\n\nJames Stewart was a down to earth, decent man whose personal life was as honorable as the lives of George Bailey and Jefferson Smith - but he admired Elwood P. Dowd, an alcoholic dreamer with an invisible giant white rabbit as his best friend. Not what you would expect of a man who piloted B-17's and led giant raids over Germany in WWII.\n\nElwood's attraction for us is perhaps what attracted him so much to James Stewart. Elwood is happy with himself and his life and even more importantly, he makes others happy with their lives. That is the great magic of Elwood and Harvey: they make others happy and they bring peace and a measure of contentment to almost everyone who know them.\n\nI have seen another version of Harvey with Art Carney and it was quite good, but lacked the sense of magic that is a benediction in this version of Harvey. In the Carney version, you can see Harvey - he is a giant white rabbit - and seeing Harvey takes much of the magic away. When you watch Jimmy Stewart, you never really know if Harvey is real or not. You know that Elwood thinks he is real and you know that Elwood's family thinks Elwood is crazy. After watching for a while, you don't really care if Harvey is real. Elwood is real and it is his belief in Harvey and what Harvey represents to him that endows him with such sweet and gentle charm. Harvey is his rejection of the harshness and materialism of the world.\n\nHarvey is a charming, magical masterpiece of kindness and goodness that somehow never becomes maudlin. Elwood and Harvey do not feel sorry for themselves and they most certainly do not expect you to feel sorry for them either. If anything, Elwood feels sorry for the rest of the world and he does not understand how everyone can't see as clearly as he does. For in his world, we are all brothers who should love as generously and kindly as Mr. Stewart's Elwood P. Dowd.",

Elwood used to be so much more pleasant, until his mother died and he had entered an emotional phase, which \ninvolved him gaining an imaginary friend. The imaginary friend is very special, as he is a six foot-three (and a half, get the facts  straight) bunny named Harvey. \n\n It really is a pretty charming film, a good fantasy, and still has comedy that works to this day. \n\nSome of it definitely would have worked better in its day, which would make it much better a few decades ago. I really rather enjoyed it though, as I do like old cinema, but I'm not sure how much it will stick out in my memory - but it really was quite enjoyable at the time. \n\nI don't know if I'd watch it again, but it was pretty good. \n Some of the plot got really ridiculous at times, but it was needed in some ways. \n\nJames Stewart is a real pleasure to watch. Some of the other actors aren't that great (like practically the rest of the whole cast, with the exception of Josephine Hull). Peggy Dow, Charles Drake and Cecil Kellaway also appear in this film. \n\n If you like old cinema, or if you like James Stewart, you should give this one a watch.",

            "content": "Before watching the 1950 tittle Harvey, actor James \"Jimmy\" Stewart was more familiar to me from his roles in Alfred Hitchcock thrillers and Anthony Mann's westerns. Thus I was initially a bit skeptical seeing one of my favorite old school actors in a comedy production where he portrays a crazed gentleman with an imaginary friend. Luckily against my preconception, Harvey turned out alright.  \n\nTelling the story of crazed, but unbelievably pleasant, small town \"nut job\"  Elwood P. Dowd (Hames Stewart), Harvey is a different kind of comedy. After all, it is not everyday that you see a comedy about a man and his huge imaginary rabbit friend. Despite bit odd setting, Harvey turned out to be quite entertaining and funny. It cannot be bypassed that the film is over 60 years old and contains awfully lot back and forth messing around humor which reminded me of some Woody Allen films .. in a bad way. Thankfully much of this can be forgiven due to James Stewart's stellar performance. His act as the pleasant but very much crazed Elwood P. Dowd is convincing as it is funny and sympathetic.\n\nStory wise there is not much to tell about Harvey, the film totally revolves around Elwood P. Dowd character and how he - through a lot of messing around and coincidences - avoids being confined to mental asylum. The film starts to be bit tedious towards the end thanks to the the extensive messing around  and the film could have easily been some 20 minutes shorter, but even as it is, the film was alright. \n\nIn the end I still  prefer James Stewart's more serious films over his comedy ones, but Harvey was not the total catastrophy as I pictured it to be from modern perspective. And if for nothing else, Harvey proves beyond a doubt that James Stewart belongs amongst the best actors coming from Hollywood to date.",

Rather than have her brother injected so he forgets Harvey, Hull's character realizes he needs to stay the same. With everyone in a happy and content mood, Dowd walks off again with his best friend.

Deadpan wit is the order of the day, here. It could have so easy been lost in the shallow grandeur  of the 50s, but Mary Chase's adaption of her own play ending up being so gosh-darn charming, and Jimmy Stewart's gentle performance as a genial alcoholic is so tender, you can't help but get swept up in the punch-drunkenness of it all. Sure, it has hardly anything in terms of plot and not what you'd call a lot of witty banter either, but Harvey is an out-and-out joy to watch, a smirk-inducing, atmospheric bit of celluloid, perfectly capturing the naivety, the delight, and the mystery life has if you look hard enough",

His sister is trying to Marry off his niece to a equally rich and respectable family but she fears that Elwoods little problem will harm this opportunity.  Jimmy Stewart is really great as Elwood; his demeanor is just so damn positive that its impossible not to smile while watching him on screen.  The film is full of some great moments like the scene where Elwood is taken to the psych ward by his sister.  The whole sub-story with Elwood's sister starting to imagine Harvey herself is great and its really played in a charismatic, funny way  by Josephine Hull.  Thematically it's a film about social acceptance and the idea of not judging someone just because they are different or unique when compared to the standard in society.  Well written and acted it's just a sweet, sincere film that only the 1950's seem to provide.",

And why wouldn't it be? After all the story of the play and the film is all about a kindly middle aged gentleman who's best friend is a imaginary 6 foot tall rabbit called Harvey.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLOTLINE: Elwood. P. Dowd (James Stewart) is a good natured alcoholic who live a life in an upper class society. But much to his sister Veta and her Daughter ever growing shock and horror Elwood has an imaginary friend which is a 6 foot tall rabbit called Harvey. Veta wants to marry off her daughter to the right suitor but with Elwood and Harvey roaming around in their home, Veta decides to commit her Brother to the local Asylum. But in a total mix up Veta ends up being committed instead so it's up to Elwood and Harvey to save her.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe film has a lot of great performances by the main cast; Josephine Hull won an Oscar for her role as Veta in this film. But the real show stealer is James Stewart as Elwood who gives one of his greatest performances. HARVEY is one neat film that is worth checking out which is why it's got a rating of 80% from me.",

Like many of the characters in the film, viewers are unwilling to accept the obvious truth that Harvey, the six foot rabbit who befriends James Stewart, is real. Thus the movie is presumed to be about society's reaction to insanity instead what it's really about, which is insanity's reaction to reality.

I thought that Jimmy Stewart did a great job with very little to it like this was a really person yet not. Another thing I liked was the painting with Harvey and Elwood P. Dowd they had in the film.\r\n\r\nI found it interesting how all the characters were convinced that Elwood P. Dowd was crazy at the beginning of the film but as the film progresses the characters begin to feel and sympathies for Elwood P. Dowd. Some even begin to have faith to believe in his story about Harvey.\r\n\r\nI thought that Josephine Hull who played Veta Louise Simmons did a very good acting job. It did not come to mind how great Josephine Hull acting was for this character in the film till I heard a commentary by Jimmy Stewart on March 8th 1990. Jimmy Stewart describes how difficult it was to play a convincing character who somewhat acknowledges Harvey yet does not completely except Harvey either. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Veta Louise Simmons finds her purse after looking for it to pay the cab driver and says \"HARVEY!\" and her eyes open up wide. That moment is created as priceless.\r\n\r\nWhat I thought was great about this film was the fact that at the end of this film it comes to be about is it more  important to be like the rest of society or to be more like yourself.",

            "content": "Personal Score: 10/10\r\n\r\nNo actor of the 1940s-1950s era was more enjoyable to watch than James Stewart (sorry Humphrey Bogart), and few of his movies were as much a delight to watch as Harvey.  \r\nIn Harvey, Stewart gives what I believe is his best performance as Elwood P. Dowd.  Dowd is as gentle and loving and courteous a man that one would think could possibly exist, but his kindness comes with the cost of putting up with his friend, Harvey.  Harvey is a six and a half foot rabbit, or pooka, which is invisible to almost everyone.  This is very troublesome for his niece and sister.\r\nVeta, Elwood's sister, and Myrtle Mae, his niece, are trying to throw a party to attract the mothers of potential suitors for Myrtle Mae.  All is going as planned until, to their horror, Elwood arrives and begins introducing Harvey to the guests.  Veta loves her brother and wants the best for him, but enough is enough.  She phones a friend of hers, a judge, to help her to arrange for Elwood to stay at a mental hospital.\r\nWhen they arrive, Veta begins to tell the doctor of her brother and of Harvey, but the way she says it makes her sound crazy and instead it is she who is committed!  Once the error is realized it is too late, and now everyone goes looking for Elwood.  It is then that the real magic of the film begins.\r\nWhen they find Elwood, they being the two doctors from the mental hospital and the nurse, they begin to realize what kind of man Elwood is, and that, perhaps, Harvey isn't as imaginary as they thought.  It is also wonderful to watch as Elwood's influence over them begins to make them better people, and even, in more than one case, causes some to fall in love.\r\nHarvey is a hilarious and heartwarming tale of a good man with a strange friend.  In a way, this film is a parable of a man's walk with God.  Notice who Dowd invites to dine with him, and then remember the kind of people Jesus dined with.  We find that people share their troubles with Dowd, and then he introduces them to Harvey and they forget their troubles.  It's certainly an interesting way to view the film, but I also recommend simply enjoying it plainly.  It's a wonderful tale with excellent performances and hilarious characters.  It's easily one of the best comedies ever made, and one of the better fantasies as well.",

It is set in the mid 1900's and is a USA based movie. Featuring James Stewart, Josephine Hull, Peggy Dow, Charles Drake, Cecil Kellaway, William H. Lynn, and Victoria Horne.\r\nThe movie is about a man named Elwood P. Dow who claims and tells every one he meets about the six foot rabbit and/or pooka named harvey that he claims to see. But his sister Rita finely has enough of her brother introducing his friend Harvey to her friends. She finnaly decides to send him to a mental institute to have him trearted so that he will stop seeing the rabit. After much confusion  the institute accidentaley lets him go he leads him unknowingly all over town. They are looking everywhere for him but they cant seemed to figured out where he went.\r\nOne aspect of the movie that is very good in this movie is the acting. Every one stays in character at all times they never stray away. The characters in this movie are very strong and the actors make it very conviencing. For example, the character Elwood P. Dow always acts as if he sees the rabbit named Harvey, and because of that the audience always believes that the rabbit is real because he believes it. I find it to actually be the best aspect of the movie.\r\nOne bad thing about the movie was the set design. In almost every scene the background is not very convencing, it looks as if it is very fake which is the opposite effect that the writers and designers and more importantley the audience wants. For example when Elwood is in the garden the audience feels as if they are looking at a background drop and plastic flowers and plants. But there are points where the background looks real but for the most part it looks fake.\r\nOverall I see the movie as a funny little comedy that was made very well but like everything in life has a few flaws. I believe that people will be coming back to see this movie over and over again for a long time. Despite the small unbelievablity in some of the scences and sets, it is a very enjoyable family movie and acceptable for all ages.",

It is set during one night in which the main character, Elwood P. Dowd, and his \"friend\" Harvey are going to and from places, being dragged around by his sister.\r\n\tThe movie begins where his sister and niece are having a party whilst he is drinking at a bar with his friend. They are dreading his coming, since they know his friend will ruin the party, and indeed it does when they fail to delay his coming. Later, his sister, maliciously, requests to have him committed, but after revealing the existence of Harvey, of who is invisible to everyone except for Elwood,  she is instead committed after becoming emotional about the whole situation. Elwood has been committed for a short time after this, but the doctor and nurse that had authority over them realize this, they set out to make him comfortable in order not to be sued. After this leads to a sequence to and from the sanatorium, named Chumley's rest after the owner of who becomes a major part only at the end of the movie, where Elwood is still unbeknownst to everything around him. He meets a few new characters along the way whilst the story is wrapping up.\r\n\tThe character Harvey is an interesting one. Being said to be a \"Pooka' which is a benign, mischievous \"god\" from Norse mythology, during the first few scenes you can doubt his existence but there are two tiny scenes where you can tell he is real. Of course, you never see the character aside from one of the scenes in question, but that was only for less than a minute. Everywhere else, he is invisible but has affected the ending in an important way in, with ought which, the movie could have been something different. Since he is mischievous, the ways he affects people are harmless, and the one sided conversations between Elwood, Chumley, and him can be quite interesting if not making you feel left out.\r\n\tThe film is mostly conversation, but after this first fourth of the movie you never feel uninterested. It made me want to know more about what was happening, although in the beginning I never had much interest in the plot until it had made itself known, that is when his sister tries to have him committed. This is, however, a movie where if you are not paying close attention to most of everything that is being said, you will get left out in some parts, so make sure that your attention is never diverted.\r\nThis is a good film, however not perfect. It has some boring talky scenes, which where this movie is majority dialogue, has a negative effect on this movie, causing you to lose interest for even a moment, and when the important part comes into play, you are lost until you can catch up, although it's a very brief catching up time. I think this movie is perfectly fine as is, although could be improved, it's a timeless classic that should not be changed, even if you want it to.",
