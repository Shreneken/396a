Price is in every scene, leading the entire narrative. Equally great is Joan Greenwood who should have received an Oscar as Sybella.",

One might argue that the narration is overused, I would say the narration added to the darkness, wit and charm of this superb film. The cinematography is crisp and smooth, and the score is great. Then we are treated to a deliciously witty script, that is funny, dark and has bite. The story slips smoothly between dastardly deaths in the guise of a self-satisfied memoir, and is gripping while moving along at a good pace, and the direction is secure. But it is the quality of the acting that elevates Kind Hearts and Coronets. Dennis Price is brilliant as the inventive killer, and Joan Greenwood is delicious as Sibella the vamp. Also convincing as Edith is Valerie Hobson, but the scene stealer in no less than eight roles is Alec Guinness in a real tour de force. While some of his roles are small, they perfectly show off his versatility. Overall, superb and deliciously dark Ealing comedy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Many black comedies are supposed to be darkly humorous, but instead wind up merely being distasteful. This is an example of one that does it right.\n\nA woman of a British noble family is disowned because of whom she married. She has a son, and then dies, and the son is working as a store clerk. He is pushed over the edge when he has a run-in with one of his distant relatives and loses his job, and for revenge he ends up causing the relative a fatal boat accident that has the effect of embarrassing the relative after death. Then he gets the idea of wiping out the rest of his relatives until he can get the noble title himself, though in doing so, his intentions do not go unnoticed.\n\nAlec Guinness plays each relative, so it tends to soften the idea of their being murdered (you see the same person again and again), and the killings are done in clever ways, which has the same effect. Not that the murderer will necessarily get off scot-free; his machinations will come back to haunt him in the end, some way or other.",

            "content": "In the early 90s in London, and in the eve of his execution, Louis Mazzini — played by Dennis Price — writes down his memoirs in prison. His calmness regarding his looming death is mystifying to the prison guards. Almost the entirety of the story is told in flashback, with Louis' novelistic voice serving as the voice-over chronicling the consequences that led to the status quo. As a result to her eloping with and marrying to someone beneath her status, his mother is not only deprived of her birthright, but also seemed to be disowned of her heir status in the royal D'Ascoyne family, as her dying wish to be buried with her family was not granted. Louis' true love, Sibella, denied him until he'd become a duke. So, he concocted a sinister plan that would simultaneously able him to miraculously climb the dukedom ladder he's entitled to and revenge for his mother, and thus serves as of both self-interest and vindictive purpose, respectively. He carefully, and fiendishly, observed and tracked on a family-tree chart on the back of a picture hanging in his room the passing and advent of every D'Ascoyne family member, \"Sometimes the deaths column brought good news. Sometimes the births column brought bad.\"\n\nKind Hearts and Coronets is an example of a Comedy of Manners, in which the superficiality of the upper classes is revealed. Typically, each character in this type of drama stands for a certain manner or folly prominent in the upper class which the work aims to satirize. Here, and in large part due to the amazing performances from the cast all around, the characters are fairly well-realized to give a sense of verisimilitude to their otherwise purposefully phlegmatic nature and lack of significant development. Sibella, marvellously played by Joan Greenwood, is an unabashedly exploitative to the point one wonders how Louis ever fell in love with her — but, after all, he himself is a real \"cad\" — while Edith D'Ascoyne presents the opposite. This sort of dichotomy between these two characters is an eminent feature in comedy of manners. Not to deviate from the mockery which the story aims at in the first place, that of denouncing those who marry for love instead of for rank, the movie's approach is explicitly not-so-subtle. In a monologue speech, Louis addresses the subject of satire quite directly before ending the life of one of the D'Ascoynes. That said, the movie is also snarky, and that can be clear from the witty dialogue, the reversal of roles and the fact one never gets away with what they've done and would be exposed at last sooner or later in a most ironic way imaginable, the latter two features also unmistakably belong to the comedy of manners.\n\nBesides the brilliant acting, what prevents the lethargy and heavy-handedness expected from all of this to sabotage the experience of the film is the delicate sense of emotion that prevails in spite of the ingenious dry British humour that engulfs the entire film and that the protagonist is, in fact, an anti-hero of sorts. There's a distinct film noir look to the cinematography that fits in with the grim undertones and subject matter that are overshadowed by the effectively wry humour. Employing Alec Guinness to play every role in the D'Ascoyne lineage with differences in gender and age is a stroke of genius. Fortunately, this then-novel gimmick has never been the main thing the movie resorts to whenever it wants to churn up a couple of laughs. The pacing drags every so often and the editing feels choppy at times. Regardless, Kind Hearts and Coronets is an extremely clever and special British satirical comedy with a gravitating performance from Dennis Price in the lead role.",

I really liked how Alec Guinness's characters all had different personality's which really helped with the atmosphere of the film.\n\nThe cinematography was very good and fit very nicely with the style of the film.\n\nThe set design and props really put you into the movie from the building designs to the various sets.\n\nThe costume design fits perfectly with the era and helps with the atmosphere of the film.\n\nThe style of the film I personally really like from the way the characters act to the comedy of the film. \n\nThe action in the film though not much is still done very well from using Bombs in food to using poison in a drink.\n\nThe dialogue is also very good from the eloquent delivery to the very well written script.\n\nThe film also has some music, but most of it is only played for a short while and is mostly played in the background.\n\nThe story follows a young boy Ascoyne  who's mother a member of a family of dukes dies wanting to be buried in the family vault, but the family won't allow it since she married someone they thought beneath them. So to get his mother buried in the family vault he seeks out to kill the rest of his family to become duke.\n\nThe comedy in my opinion works really well from the subtle comedy to the front and centre comedy.\n\nThe film also has a really good atmosphere especially toward the end.\n\nThe film in my opinion is also really enjoyable and one that I will be watching again very soon.\n\nThe film does have maybe one or two mistakes, but they don't take away that much.\n\nOver all I give it a 10/10 - one of the best",

As the audience watches the undeniably warped protagonist commit all of these crimes in the name of his own vengeance against the nobles-that-be, we definitely feel that what he's doing is wrong. But we're still undoubtedly fascinated to see  where things will go. Indeed, more contemporary works like \"Nightcrawler,\" \"There Will Be Blood,\" \"House Of Cards,\" and even \"Taxi Driver\" owe a certain amount of credit to how well things worked out for a narrative with this kind of audacity back in the day. Every plot element in \"Kind Hearts And Coronets\" is intricately laid out, with real intention emanating from the events as they unfold. I only wish the film's admittedly intermittent tone of sardonicism was as consistently impressive as the plotting work. Overall though, a fairly successful tale of depravity and duplicity.",

My first foray into the films that were shot post war at the old Ealing Studios in London, U.K. that became known as Ealing comedies.\nIt is more a black comedy. Showing humour such as the screenplay itself. \nThe screenplay is about a rich, aristocratic family called D'Ascoyne's. The family has a noble title producing the Lord Chalfont.\nThe family have a black sheep as such caused by one of the members having a relationship and producing a son with an Italian.\nThe said black sheep of the family, a female branch and the son Louis Mazzini (Vincent Price) live in relative London suburbia poverty well away from the trappings of aristocracy.\nIn later life Louis becomes bitter and vows revenge on the family who have disowned him and stand in the way of the dukedom. All eight members!\nHence a series of murders occurs as Louis becomes ever closer to being ancestor to the Lord Chalfont title.\nI didn't realise until watching the film that all those eight members of both genders are brilliantly portrayed by Alex Guiness. A far cry from some of his roles in later life!\nThe film is a delight and the old black and white photography a triumph that adds to the class of the film.\nOn further reading the Director of Photography is Douglas Slocombe who I recognise from Carry On films to Indiana Jones blockbusters.\nSurprisingly good first foray into the Ealing comedy.",

The whole sequence of events leading up to and including Louis knocking off the claimants to the dukedom makes for compelling viewing.  Quirkily funny at times too.\n\nMore than just a crime drama, the movie also pokes fun at England's class and peerage system.  You can well imagine that someone would go to such lengths for a title and the wealth and other benefits it bestows.\n\nSolid work by Dennis Price as Louis.

To see that the pages he'd written all along we're still sitting on the desk inside the prison was a complete shock that made me scream out loud in laughter.\n\nOverall, this movie was absolutely brilliant and the acting was superb. I like to think that he was able to go back into the prison and retrieve the pages. Then after that, he would retreat with Edith and kill off Sibella. After all, Edith, to me, is way more prettier and more lovely than Sibella. She is more pure than Sibella.

It is a very dark comedy, because it tries to make all these murders seem like an insignificant thing. The true magic of the film is that, by making the killer our narrator it actually gets the audience into his head and somehow makes it OK that he is killing these people even to the point where you are rooting for him. I'm not spoiling a whole lot here, although it seems like I am, because there is a framing device that sets up Louis already on death row as the duke. I have a hard time expressing just how delightful this film is, because the story sounds so dark, but I genuinely laughed out loud more than once. I think what makes it work is the combination of the cast (which I'll get into in just a second) and the script. Usually I don't think I'd care for a framing device like this one, because it reveals too much at the outset. However there is still a bit of mystery in Kind Hearts and Coronets. Ultimately the puzzle becomes figuring out just how he got caught, it's almost like a reverse murder mystery.\n\nNow the cast must be addressed here. First of all Dennis Price is amazing as Louis. He is both sympathetic and cunning. He does a superb job of portraying all the conflicting emotions he is dealing with, but also the cold calculation that is necessary for his machinations to work. Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood are perfect as Louis' 2 love interests because they have such totally different performances. Just from their accents and intonation you can tell what kind of person they are and what Louis sees in them. Now I've avoided talking about the master stroke of Kind Hearts and Coronets long enough. The truth is, while Dennis Price has the lead role, this film is only possible because of the brilliance of Alec Guinness. He plays the part of all 8 members of the duke's family. I didn't know this going in so I was extremely surprised to see that familiar face popping up again and again. He is the comedic heart of this film, and he delivers 8 unique performances. Aside from seeing the familiar features in each face there really isn't much to connect his portrayal of the Admiral and the Parson, or the Duke and Lady Agatha. All around I was just delighted by Kind Hearts and Coronets and I highly recommend it, especially if you still think Alec Guinness is just \"that guy who played Obi-Wan Kenobi.\"",

            "content": "It's an early black comedy, or, if you will, an \"extra black\"-and-white comedy. ...Okay, well, at least this film is funnier then what I just said, and this film isn't exactly all that high of a standard, which is shocking, because, for all extents and purposes, this film should still be very effective. I mean, come now, of course this dark, Britastically dry comedy's humor would have stood the test of time, because it's only a measly little, oh, about almost 65 years old. Man, this film is so old that it stars Alec Guinness, who was old by the time he did \"Star Wars\", and also stars Dennis Price, who was, well, a year younger than Guinness, but nonetheless dead by the time \"Star Wars\" came out, so of course the annoyingly nostalgic critics are still calling this film hilarious, even - nay - especially in retrospect. I don't know about you people, but probably the funniest thing about this film is the name of the guys who wrote the book upon which this film is based, and whose name I'm not going to go ahead and say (Look it up and see just how much tastefulness in humor has died throughout the decades), because as this opener's first sentence will tell you, I can sure mess up a play on word. Oh, that joke was doomed from the get-go, much like comedy sensibilities of the 1940s, as this film, well, will tell you sometimes. Wow, I am really just knocking out of the park when it comes to showing that I'm perfectly sophisticated enough to be credible in a discussion of this film, but rest assured, people, I can back up my opinion that this film is hardly rewarding, much less funny, and yet, it's hard to deny what is done right in this film.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else can be said about this film, it looks pretty good for its time, and even to this day, as art director William Kellner captures a tasteful classiness in his designing of this world, often complimented by obviously limited, but generally noticeably sharp lighting tastes, explored by cinematographer Douglas Slocombe. At the time it's release, this film just had to have turned heads, as it remains visually appealing to this day, with clever art direction and tasteful photography that give you a comfortable and handsome feel for this film's world, further old on you by a certain other relatively upstanding aspect. Okay, perhaps upstanding isn't exactly the perfect word to use when describing this film's acting, as this isn't the type of film that commands strong performances, yet that doesn't stop this film from flaunting talented performers, who aren't used to their full advantage, but still engage more than the film itself, with leading man Dennis Price being charismatic and convincing as the classy, but corrupt man out for the blood of those who wronged him, while Alec Guinness steals the show, taking on not one, or two, or three, or even four, but eight roles, and making each one distinct through a careful attention to presence that leaves Guinness to become each and every one of his characters. I really do with I could say that the film is as sharp as its look and performances, as it is so messy and disengaging, with efforts that generally fall flat and leave the final product to gradually slip, but not without leaving behind some undeniable high points in storytelling. I for one would perhaps consider this film more pompous than witty, but rest assured that there are moments in which the film does, in fact, take on effective wit, particularly when it comes to the sense of humor that might not always work, - especially when being played up to the point of breaking a surprisingly consistency in this film's straight face with moderate silliness - but still has those moments of amusing effectiveness that give you a taste of what could have been. Granted, this film was never to be all that sharp, so don't expect the drops of potential fulfillment to be all that rich, but do expect them to at least be present, often on the backs of handsome visuals and strong acting, and sometimes on the back of effectiveness within the telling of this reasonably promising effort. The film has a fair bit at its back, but alas, in the end, the film just cannot cross that line into decency, coming close, but not close enough to avoid a dreaded plunge into mediocrity, anchored by an emotional distance that is itself anchored by questionable storytelling.\r\n\r\nOpening right up with Dennis Price's Louis Mazzini character in prison after the events that are not at all shown right away, this film offers no immediate development and is mostly unraveled in a flashback that you would think would compensate for the out-of-the-gate trip-up in exposition, but ends up being much more flawed than it should be, seeing as how it takes up the film's body, slam-banging through its points and delivering on little expository depth, as though it were planning on breaking out of the flashback that ends up being no mere recap of events preceding what is the majority of the final product, but most of the awkwardly rushed final product itself. Falling into all of the tropes of a throw-away flashback sequence, complete with skimming that is in no way helped by prominence in Dennis Price's summarizing narration, the body of this film is slapdashed and distancing, and such questionable story structuring methods deal a mighty blow to the film, no matter how much it ostensibly attempts to balance pacing out by meeting structurally rushed moments with atmospheric momentum that is anything but pumped out. The film is rarely, if ever necessarily all-out boring, but when this film really dries up, - as it oh so very often does - things really start to slow down, while blandness does the opposite, growing wealthier and wealthier, until devolving into dullness that would perhaps be compensated for if this film wasn't so quiet and tamed, defying traditional comedic atmosphere with a cold restraint that gets to be too intense, and is not backed up enough by lively material for entertainment value to go sustained. I know all of this complaining about a dull atmosphere and rushed narrative doesn't sound like too big of a deal, but when you get down to it, this film is just too dry for its own good, and its narrative is too driven by intentionally undercooked flashback sensibilities for its own good, meandering along with a distancingly lack of humanity that leaves you to meditate upon the lack of likability within the characters, as well as certain other shortcomings in the basic layout of this premise. There's a certain degree of immediate intrigue to this dry, darkly humorous study on a gentlemen with a dark vengeful side, but most intrigue goes lost in translation, thus you're only left with the natural shortcomings in this story, of which there are many, as this subject matter is mighty thin, with plenty of consequence, but still not enough juiciness surrounding and reinforcing the kick to such consequence, whose instrumental flavor rests in the hand of those who execute this sensitive story concept. Needless to say, the shortcomings in this film's thin story concept are not simply not compensated for by the telling of this tale, but intensified, as this film rushes through expository depth with a dully bland atmosphere and emotional distance that further thin out this story, until it stands as nothing more than barely structured and truly near-monotonously aimless. There are well-done aspects to this film, I'm not denying that, but the retrospective lauding of this film cannot possibly not be heavily influenced by nostalgia and appreciation of age over substance, because even if you look at this film for its time, outside of the look and performances, there's nothing terribly outstanding here, but a whole lot to complain about, as the final product drags along, keeping expository depth lacking, atmosphere dull, structure thin and overall resonance distanced, not so much so that the film isn't brought to the border of decency by what it does do so right, yet nevertheless to where you end up with a mediocre misfire that would have been forgotten were it not for its being kept alive by the hopelessly misguided nostalgics.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, handsome art direction, strong performances - particularly by the show-stealingly transformative Alec Guinness - and high points in witty storytelling bring the final product to the brink of decency, but don't quite succeed in battling back nostalgia, as there is too much distancing slapdashing within primarily flashback format-driven storytelling, bland, if not dull dryness in atmosphere, and aimless thinness in story structuring for resonance to be sustained enough to prevent \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" from gradually devolving into a borderline likable, but generally unrewarding mess of a fall-flat \"classic\" piece of dark comedy.\r\n\r\n2.25/5 - Mediocre",

Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price) was once heir to the title of Duke of Chalfont, but because his mother (Audrey Fildes) married a commoner, (an Italian opera singer), Louis found his branch of the family being shunned from such entitlement by the D'Ascoyne family, which consist of photographer Henry, Admiral Lord Horatio, Lady Agatha, General Lord Rufus, Duke Ethelred, the Reverend Lord Henry, posh cad Ascoyne and Lord Ascoyne Snr.

            "content": "Since the brand was revived several years ago, Ealing Studios have developed a reputation for quaintness. With the exception of John Landis' underrated Burke and Hare, the majority of the new Ealing's output has been frothy, often retrograde films designed solely for the export market. How easily we forget that the self-same studio once produced some of the darkest, edgiest and blackest comedies the world had ever seen. And there is no better example of this than Kind Hearts and Coronets, which takes pride of place with The Red Shoes as one of the finest British films of the 1940s.\r\n\r\nDescribing any old film as 'edgy' comes with problems. Changes in social attitudes since the 1940s means that, on one level, filmmakers are now able to show a wider range of subjects to a greater extent than ever before. Under this line of argument, what was once considered edgy, radical or insightful now looks timid and tame. But even if we accept this as a general rule, Kind Hearts and Coronets still stands as a proud and intriguing exception. Like Peeping Tom eleven years later, it has retained its emotional impact even after its aesthetic achievements have been surpassed.\r\n\r\nKind Hearts and Coronets is a comedy about a serial killer, at a time when the vast majority of films involving murder sought to completely demonise the assailant in question. More than that, it is about a serial killer who vengefully targets the aristocracy, who while waning in power still held a great deal of influence in government and high society. The film is a vitriolic attack on the British class system, thinly disguised as an erudite comedy of manners. To paraphrase Macbeth, it may look like the innocent flower, but it is most definitely the serpent under it, and its venom is ruthless and bitter.\r\n\r\nIn a further comparison to Peeping Tom, the film had a rocky ride with the censors when first released. Sir Michael Balcon, then-head of Ealing, sought to distance himself from the film, believing that the public could not handle its ironic treatment of the subject matter. In line with the restrictive Hays Code, the American distributors requested that Robert Hamer added a ten-second epilogue, to show Louis Mazzini getting his comeuppance in a way while the original ending only implied. While Alec Guinness went on to win an Oscar for The Bridge on the River Kwai, neither Dennis Price nor Robert Hamer would ever reach this level of success again. Film critic David Thompson described the latter's fortunes as \"the most serious miscarriage of talent in post-war British cinema\".\r\n\r\nMany of the classic Ealing comedies used present events to satirise the past and vice versa. Passport to Pimlico satirised both the Berlin airlift and the exile of the Dutch monarchy to Canada, while some commentators have argued that The Ladykillers is a send-up of the post-war Labour government. Kind Hearts and Coronets was made in the year of the Second Parliament Act, which further curbed the power of the House of Lords and with it the aristocracy. The real-life political attack on landed wealth is contrasted with the lethal attacks of Louis Mazzini, with the aristocracy being 'killed off' in both cases.\r\n\r\nKind Hearts and Coronets has a very poisonous view of the British class system, and in particular of the aristocracy's attempts to justify its position. While marrying out of love may have brought Mazzini's mother poverty, marrying for wealth and \"good breeding stock\" brings nothing but misery. Whatever diversions the D'Ascoynes may pursue (the navy, photography, the church, hunting) there are a universally inward-looking bunch, with little time for anyone whose interests or backgrounds are not identical to their own.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mazzini is of noble blood, his training as a draper, shop assistant and bank clerk gives him a middle-class status, something which simultaneously repulses and pleases him because it serves as the perfect cover for his crimes. The closer he comes to his goal of becoming Duke of Chalfont, the more he takes on the characteristics of a D'Ascoyne, shunning his childhood sweetheart Sibella (Joan Greenwood) and refusing to help Lionel in his hour of need. The film brutally depicts the entrenched arrogance of the British elites, something which has persisted longer after the D'Ascoynes of this world have withered away.\r\n\r\nDennis Price, who had previously found fame in Powell and Pressburger's A Canterbury Tale, is absolutely extraordinary in the lead role. Having been aptly described as \"sourly handsome\", he presents Louis Mazzini as a man of immense class and sophistication, but who is also capable of being cold, dismissive, callous and sociopathic. Price was always self-deprecating about his acting abilities, describing himself as \"second-rate\" and \"lacking the essential spark.\" But whatever else happened in his career, this performance is enough to dismiss all such deprecation.\r\n\r\nWhat makes his performance so interesting is that, for a lot of the time, Price doesn't speak. The prolific use of voiceover gives his performance a silent movie quality - not because his movements are exaggerated, but because his facial expressions and posture play a bigger part in his characterisation. Normally this amount of voiceover could quickly become tedious, but here it works brilliantly, taking us behind Mazzini's mask of dignity. It makes his deadpan expression all the more funny, as the most unspeakable things are uttered without the merest twitch of his lips. It is as though we were inside the mind of a killer, hearing his darkest deeds completely uncensored and without any license on the part of the screenwriter.\r\n\r\nKind Hearts and Coronets' themes of love and class are also expressed in Mazzini's relationships with women. For most of the film he is taken with Sibella, who marries Lionel but confides in Louis due to their friendship as children, and increasingly out of desperation as just how boring her husband is. Louis strings Sibella along, playing with her heart strings and being glad to kiss her while knowing he can never bring himself to be with her. This is a further example of Louis' corruption as he grows closer to his goal, becoming as cold and as haughty as the people who caused him to swear revenge.\r\n\r\nIf Sibella is the proud plaything who is ultimately beneath his stature, Edith (Valerie Hobson) provides the security of wealth and the moral backbone Louis needs. Their initial meeting, while her husband is still alive, indicates that such a marriage would not be any fun: her strong religious conviction forbids drinking, leading her husband to keep gin and whisky in his dark room. Much of the film plays out like a bedroom farce as Louis tries to keep the two women from ever meeting. In the final scene, he has to choose between dull security and loving disgrace, quoting from The Beggar's Opera as he struggles to make up his mind.\r\n\r\nThe humour in Kind Hearts and Coronets is as black as can be, with multiple jokes about hanging and all the murders having a comedic quality. These range from the general being blown up as he opens the caviar, to the admiral mistaking port for starboard and sinking his ship, and finally Mazzini's employer dying of shock after inheriting the title. There are dozens of laugh-out-loud moments, such as Mazzini's comments after shooting down Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne: \"I shot an arrow through the air; she fell to earth in Berkeley Square.\" But a lot of the time the film is so edgy and so forthright that you're almost afraid to laugh: the barb is so strong that to laugh is almost too easy a response.\r\n\r\nThe film is most popularly remembered for Alec Guinness, who plays all eight members of the D'Ascoyne family. He was originally only offered four roles, but pressed Hamer to cast him in all eight after reading the script. Suffice to say, he's magnificent, with each family member having clearly developed character traits and quirks, and each looking hilariously pompous in all that make-up. The split-screen shooting used to put all eight characters on screen is utterly seamless, and Hamer's direction is totally first-rate.\r\n\r\nKind Hearts and Coronets is a perfect black comedy, which is as funny as Monty Python and the Holy Grail and as artistically accomplished as the best work of Powell and Pressburger. The performances are all superb, particularly from Guinness and Price, and Robert Hamer's direction gives the film a note-perfect pace so that all the jokes hit the spot. Over 60 years since it took the world by storm, it remains the darkest, edgiest and funniest of the classic Ealing comedies, and will be reducing generations to fits of laughter for years to come.",

Kind Hearts and Coronets is probably most famous today as \"that film in which Alec Guinness plays eight characters.\" That said, it is Denis Price as Louis Mazzini, the charming, urbane serial killer, who really steals the show.\n\nThe film opens in prison, with the Louis Mazzini D'Ascoyne, Ninth Duke of Chalfont awaiting execution for one of the few suspicious deaths in the film he wasn't responsible for. On that, his last night, he is completing his memoirs, which act as a framing device for the rest of the film, as well as allowing for a dry, witty narration from Mazzini himself.\n\nKind Hearts and Coronets is everything modern cinema is not. It is not laugh-out-loud comedy, but a biting wit that often leaves you wondering whether you should be laughing at all. The screenwriter takes seeming delight in the precision of the dialogue, with no unnecessary verbiage. This culminates in an astonishing minimalist performance from Price when he finds himself in the dock of the House of Lords, being tried by his peers.\n\nI suppose you could look at Kind Hearts and Coronets as a form of social commentary. It was made after WWII, after the Beverage reforms, and may reflect a growing restlessness with the stuffiness of the old social order. Certainly, Louis is presented with such sympathy, and his nefarious endeavours told with such gleeful abandon that it is difficult for the audience not to identify with him.\n\nYou could regard it as a form of social commentary but, frankly, why bother? It's just glorious fun and, despite a certain English post-war feel, surprisingly modern and anarchic - there can be few films, even today, which cast a multiple murderer so firmly in the hero role. And there can be few modern films were the dialogue is so witty, for instance, when excusing his flustered state of mind after his first murder by saying \"furthermore, I am not naturally callous\".\n\nOf course, everyone talks about Alec Guinness' acting tour de force - playing all eight other members of the D'Ascoyne family; from young Ascoyne D'Ascoyne to the hilariously named Elthelred D'Ascoyne (presumable unready for the fate that awaits him), the Eighth Duke of Chalfont. In reality, few of these characters receive more than a footnote in the film. But this is more than made up for by the splendid cast of other leading British actors - Denis Price, Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood being the notables.\n\nThis remains not only my favourite Ealing Comedy, but right up there with Dr Strangelove as one of my favourite comedy films ever made. A wonderful, heart-warming tale of multiple murder.",

Price takes this gesture as an insult, and makes a plan to kill the entire D'Ascoyne family: all of the rightful heirs to the Duke's throne, so that he can become the Duke himself. Each of the eight members of the D'Ascoyne family are played by Alec Guinness, all of them pride filled and retaining a sense of honor, and Price must find a way to sneak around their busy lifestyles and kill each of them without getting caught. \r\n\r\nThere's much hype around Alec Guinness playing eight roles and not to say that he wasn't good, but he just wasn't great. I guess I was expecting a sort of Dr. Strangeloveesque concept where each of his roles were more ridiculous than the next, but other than playing an eccentric-feminist: they were all generally bland. Maybe if he was in the film more and Dennis Price had less screen time, though Price was superb, it might have been a bit more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI was also expecting it to a clever dark comedy with painstakingly laughs, but the only parts I found comedy in were the spontaneous deaths which became more and more creative as the movie progressed. Everything else just seemed to be satirizing British royalty, which isn't really that funny unless you lived in 1940s England. The ironic ending was very crafty as well.\r\n\r\nSo far I've described this film as just not living up to my expectations and yet still being witty and well acted. So to my point: where this movie falls flat is the strenuously tied in romance and sub-plot about an affair that the main character is having with his childhood friend. Personally it made the majority of this movie a bore. And everything else, mostly the acting, was enticing.\r\n\r\nOne more point before I end this, and that's I found the direction to be particularly soulless and the editing to be half-assed: so it's bereft of art. There is little diversity in camera angles and a shot of a hot air balloon hanging from a visible wire.\r\n\r\nIs this worth seeing? First you have to ask yourself \"How much do I like Alec Guinness?\". If you are a diehard Alec Guinness fan, it may please you, and if not then you will be surprised at how infrequently he's in the film. It really has little appeal beyond the dark comedy: but the dark comedy is damn good.\r\n\r\nA prime example of British wit and some clever performances. 91/100",

            "content": "I approached this with some skepticism but was roiling in riotous laughter within minutes. How a film can be this uproarious, biting and relevant 60 years after release is beyond me. The only recent comedies I can recall that were as hilarious and satisfying all seem to emanate from the English isles ('In The Loop', and a pair of Simon Pegg-Edgar Wright gems).\n\nThis is true black comedy in all its majestic glory: deliciously underhanded, bitingly satiric, furiously whip-smart and, of course, a laugh riot. Dennis Price is Louis Mazzini, 10th in line to a Dukedom but mired in poverty b'cos his mother was cast out for marrying - of all things - for love, rather than land or wealth or prestige. When his mother dies in poverty and is denied her final wish of being buried in the family crypt, Louis schemes bloody vengeance - to usurp the Dukedom by offing every single heir - all played hilariously by Sir Alec Guinness - in his way. It is a brilliant scheme, and Louis's exceedingly proper narration of such grim doings is one of the film's strong counterpoints (his quite natural disdain for hunting and other 'bloodsports' is delivered so drolly and matter-of-factly that it becomes a laugh-out-loud punchline in light that he is at the same time plotting to kill his uncle the Duke).\n\nAll the kudos over the years have gone to Alec Guinness, who is rightfully lauded for playing 8 so different characters, ranging from an endearing if foppish 24-year-old to a doddering old senile priest. It's quite brilliant to watch how convincing he is, even with the limitations of makeup in those days. But Dennis Price, the lead, the 'hero', should not be kept in the dark, b'cos the film flies or fails with him, and it is his amazing performance - so prim, so proper, so diabolically dashing - that is the true cornerstone of the film. Watching his quite delicate and methodical approach to serialized murder is a thrill, and he consistently provides the most laughs without ever telling a 'joke'; comedies, especially the British ones, were so much more organic back then.\n\nIt is a critique of class, and its culmination in a trial b4 the House of Lords is the fitting climax, where Louis is so prim and civilized he will not even risk an outburst at the prospect of being hanged for a crime he alleges not to have committed. The Hays Code enforced a change in the ending for American release, but the delicious ambiguity of the original finale is a wondrous joy to behold. 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' is fiendishly funny and insightful, and certainly one of the greatest comedies committed to celluloid.\n\nADDENDUM: I was shocked to hear the word \"nigger\" used not once but twice, in such casual refrain, but even that did not upset by enjoyment of the film, b'cos there was no malice at all in it. I did some reading and found that it was not widely viewed as derogatory in the UK at that time, and was still the commonplace word in the rhyme \"Eeny meeny miny moe\" (in place of \"tiger\"). Of course, the Hays Code wisely (for once) enforced a change to \"sailor\" for its American use, the first time I know of that gov't film censorship in America was actually for the betterment of all involved.",

Of course, a review of this film would not even be complete without even hinting on Alec Guinness' legendary performance/s as the eight heirs of the d' Ascoyne  dukeship, all on cue on Mazzini's crosshair. The whole murder scheme was comic gold all on itself that audience's anticipation for the next kill isn't primarily focused on whether or not Mazzini can pull it off, but instead for the simple reason of one's craving for some black laughter. The latter part of the film is more serious however, as Scotland Yard and the judiciary system interferes with the seemingly perfect crime, but not mainly as a plot device or even a deus ex machina type pay-off for the character, but to provide the great \"irony\" for the film, a figurative language that even the Ealing Studio boss himself does not have much faith into, but nevertheless delivered what was needed to complete this tale of comic vengeance wrapped in ambition.",

One of several comedy classics of the post-WWII era from Ealing Studios, the film is both ironic and bitingly funny. While the ending of the British version leads the audience to believe that Price will escape punishment for his crimes, American censors insisted that the criminal had to be punished for U.S. distribution, and so a less amusing ending was tacked on for the benefit of overly sensitive Yanks. Also of note is Joan Greenwood's performance as the murderer's childhood friend Sibella. Ealing was often an underfunded studio, so the production values are modest, though adequate. If there is an area in which the tech credits shine, it is the make-up and costuming of Guinness.",

The film then goes to an extended flashback of which takes up the duration of the film. In Edwardian England, Louis is the son of a woman who was disowned by her aristocratic family for eloping with an Italian opera singer. On her deathbed, the D'Ascoynes deny her last wish, to be entombed in the family crypt. Louis then plots to have his revenge on his relatives and to inherit the D'Ascoyne dukedom, however there are eight relative standing in his way from becoming Duke. Louis determines to murder each of his relatives, all played by the great Alec Guinness. He kills 6 of the 8 relatives in inventive, blackly humorous, and ironic ways. The Young Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, the son of Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, is pushed over a weir with his girlfriend in a boat by Louis; Young Henry D'Ascoyne, a photographer, accidentally explodes the petrol in his lamp inside his darkroom; the Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne dies from poison Louis puts into his port; Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne is killed by Louis firing an arrow into her hot air balloon plunging her back to earth; the Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne dies without the assistance of Louis when his ship sinks while going towards the Port side instead of Starboard and in turn crashing into another ship causing the sinking of the ship; the General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne is killed by Louis who sends him a bomb posing as a pot of caviar that the General sets off when he puts his knife into it; Ethelred D'Ascoyne, the VIIIth Duke of Chalfont, is lured by Louis into a mantrap and shoots him with his own gun, making it look like it was an accident; and finally Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, a banker, employer of Louis and the IXth Duke of Chalfont, dies of shock after hearing of the death of the previous Duke. During this time Louis involved with two women, first Sibella, played by Joan Greenwood, who is the wife of his childhood rival Lionel, played by John Penrose, and the other Edith, played by Valerie Hobson, who is the widow of his second victim. He eventually marries Edith but when Lionel goes bankrupt and kills himself, Sibella hides his suicide note. Louis is then tried by his peers in the House Of Lords and is convicted of murdering Lionel, whom he did not kill. Sibella however \"finds\" the suicide note and Louis is then released in time before he can be hanged. Stepping through the prison gate with greets from a cheering crowd, there are two carriages awaiting him: Edith's and Sibella's. He is unable to choose between them and when a representative of a magazine asks for the publication rights to his memoirs, Louis realizes that he left the incriminating papers in his prison cell. It is then left ambiguous to the viewer whether his guilt is discovered.\n\nThe Ealing Comedy classic Kind Hearts and Coronets is based on a novel by Roy Horiman brilliantly brought to the screen by director/screenwriter Robert Hamer. Hamer's script is utterly brilliant. The witty dialogue fantastic. Robert Hamer directs his actors with great skill. The film is highlighted by two actors who give great performances. Dennis Price plays the scoundrel son of a disowned woman to a tee and his performance is only surpassed by the inimitable Alec Guinness who plays eight very different characters with subtle brilliance. The production values aren't too bad though they are only slightly faulty because the studio was usually underfunded. Kind Hearts and Coronets is a fantastic piece of British black humor that is at times more of a crime film than a straight up comedy but the comedy is done in a subtle way. It is truly one of the best black comedies ever made and all movie lovers should sit down and watch it. 9/10",

            "content": "Actually, He Played Everybody!  \r\n\r\nThe title, of course, refers to a poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson which informs us that the former is worth more than the latter.  The implication, I rather suspect, is that Our Narrator, Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price), devalues himself over the course of the film.  His determination to avenge the wrongs he feels, not without justification, to have been dealt make him do things no sane person would do.  All the funnier that he declares that he won't actually shoot anything while his uncle (or something) does, because he won't participate in such bloodsport.  It was said at one point that they were trying to sell irony, and that never worked, but what with one thing and another, this is still considered one of the greatest British films of all time.\r\n\r\nLouis's mother (Audrey Fildes) married an Italian tenor for love.  Her aristocratic family turned her out because of it, and even when her husband died on the day her son was born, they wouldn't take her back.  She raised her son on this resentment, making sure he never forgot how close he was to the Dukedom of Chalfont.  (Due to complicated legal maneuvering explained at the beginning of the movie, inheritance is, in this family, possible through the female line even in 1900.)  When his mother dies, it boils over--the family won't let her be buried in the familial plot.  Louis decides he has had enough, and he is going to claim his inheritance if it means killing every single D'Ascoyne (Sir Alec Guinness) standing in his way.  This is complicated by his relationship with childhood friend Sibella (Joan Greenwood), who married someone else when she thought he wouldn't amount to anything, and his interest in the widowed Edith D'Ascoyne (Valerie Hobson).  \r\n\r\nAnd don't those D'Ascoynes drop like flies!  The Admiral dies in a naval accident, apparently based on a real event, and the Banker is weakened by a stroke and then has a heart attack upon discovering his inheritance of the title.  However, in one way or another, Louis does away with the other six.  While there are at least two cases I can think of which should have borne investigation, in one of those, there's no reasonable expectation that anyone ever would have been convicted, or even accused.  Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne, the suffragette, is in a balloon flying over London, and it is . . . damaged.  This would be, to me at least, obviously murder, given how it's damaged, but also given how it's damaged, she would just be a martyr to the cause, and there is no possible way of figuring out exactly who martyred her.  And that is one of the pleasures of the various plots; the ones which couldn't be seen as accidents or natural could almost never be traced to him, except maybe the last one.\r\n\r\nThe Duke tells Louis that he's quite obviously insane, and for once, I agree.  \"Insane\" has a very specific meaning and isn't the same as just crazy or even mentally ill.  You see, at no time over the course of the story does Louis ever really consider that what he's doing is wrong.  They wronged his mother, and therefore, they must pay.  The lot of them.  One of them even complains about some man who asked that his mother be allowed to be buried there, not realizing that it was Louis and that his mother had been a D'Ascoyne.  And, yes, those with any responsibility should have had to face it.  I just don't think most of them had anything to do with it or possibly even knew what was going on.  Even if they had, being murdered was not going to bring Louis's mother back or make them sorry for what they did to her.  However, once he's set on his goal, Louis doesn't even really seem to consider that.  He's decided that they must die, and so they do.  He's only glad the the Banker, whom he actually likes, dies of natural causes before he's forced to murder him.  There is, however, as close to no doubt as matters that he would have done so had the Banker not had his heart attack.\r\n\r\nPeter Sellers quite famously told Jim Henson that, while he could be Queen Victoria, he didn't know how to be himself.  (So they dressed him up as Queen Victoria.)  Sir Alec didn't have that problem.  The problem he did have was that he knew he wasn't Obi-Wan Kenobi.  He hated it.  He hadn't liked the movie while he was making it, though his costars say he was polite enough so that you wouldn't know it.  The only thing he liked about it, from what anyone can tell, is that he was about the only person confident it would be a hit, so he managed to negotiate himself 2% of the gross.  He didn't, after that, have to do \"the money, dear boy\" movies.  He and his wife, who were married for sixty-two years, were able to live happily, if modestly, on that.  (And how modestly probably depends on your definition.)  It broke his heart that, after all that--unto an Oscar for a movie he was actually proud of--people thought of him in the Mos Eisley Cantina.",

It's just dark comedy and pretty obvious dark comedy at that.\r\n\r\nWe meet our lead actor Louis (Dennis Price) in prison writing a book of his devious exploits. Feeling cheated out of his family inheritance, he devises ways to kill off members of the family tree (hence the dvd cover art with a tree and him with a bloody axe). His resentment is fueled by the loss of his impoverished and kind mother who dies early in the film in a street accident.  \r\n\r\nThe title's significance, Kind Hearts and Coronets, comes from a paraphrased line in a poem read during the film.  The mother is the kind heart who sacrifices for her son into adulthood, while the coronets are the royal aristocrats who disown her and her son. \r\n\r\nAlec Guinness plays 8 of the despised royal family members in this rather fast paced black and white film.  Although subtitles would help me understand the accents here (and they were mentioned as an option in the cover jacket), my copy had no subtitles offered.  This situation has happened before with other dvd releases.\r\n\r\nThe motivation of Louis to knock off his royal family competition comes from the rude treatment by the family. The mother strayed by marrying a singing commoner.  When her husband dies suddenly and early in the film , she keeps writing to the her aristocratic family but recieves no replies save for one grudging and resounding \"we never heard of you\" type letter. (jeeez, that one gets me every time)\r\n\r\nWe should all be laughing hysterically aloud by now, but the early scenes are really more tradgic than comedic, but the line between the two is sometimes indistiguishable. \r\n\r\nThe overwhelming charm of this film and the disguised roles of Guiness prompted me to give it a fresh. Its narrated by Louis from time to time as well. \r\n\r\nThe American version of the film had to end to suit the \"crime does not pay\" code of the time.  Suggest you watch this one if you get that sudden urge for British dry humor.",

The tale of a exiled member of the royal family who kills off the family in front of him in an attempts to attain the throne of Duke is filled with a wealth of black humor that makes the film oddly delightful to watch, and Dennis Price is great as the murdering member of the family.  He keeps a calm demeanor throughout to the point of having an arrogance, even when it appears as if he will be executed for his crimes (the film opens with this, so not much of a spoiler).  Many of the deaths are pretty funny, and his expression of false remorse at their passing is a riot.  It is like a serial killer's comedy of manners, a morbid delight of the film.  And though this would make for a good film regardless, Alec Guinness makes this movie incredible.  Guinness plays not one but all eight of the heirs that are killed off in the film.  Guinness is astounding in his ability to slip in to each role, whether it be an enthusiastic young man, or a decrepit, absent minded old gentleman, or a snooty older woman.  None of the roles are played as screwball caricatures, but instead are played straight and each has their own set of speech, attitudes, behaviors, and mannerisms.  This is a terrific film to showcase what a good range of acting can accomplish and how an accomplished actor differentiates between several different roles.  Fans of Guinness' work in Star Wars as Obi-Wan (i.e., which should be everyone shouldn't it?) will be blown away by his talents in this picture.",

This is a delightful film, made even more so by the fact that it's a black comedy -- the whole premise is based on the idea of a man killing off his family members in order to earn a long-denied royal title of Duke. \r\n\r\nThis started off a little slow for me, and I didn't see a lot of humor in it. But it gained momentum as it went along, and by the last 1/2 hour I was laughing out loud, and the surprise ending had me laughing hysterically and literally applauding. Alec Guinness has gotten all the attention over the years, since he plays eight roles in the films. But since each of those roles are little more than cameos, he is not actually the star of the film. Although, I have to admit that seeing him dressed as Aunt Agatha, riding in a hot air balloon, \"her\" long hair blowing in the breeze, will stick with me forever. No, that honor goes to Dennis Price. He carries on as if killing off his whole family is entirely logical and proper and ANYONE in his position would do the same thing.

There's no doubt that one of Kind Hearts and Coronets' greatest claims to fame is the fact that all eight heirs are played by Alec Guinness, and it's a worthy claim - unlike modern day multiple performances, while Guinness is heavily made up, his characters are as much differentiated by their performances as their look. But there's so much more to Kind Hearts, from the gleefully twisted ironies throughout (my favorite might be Guest's disdain for hunting birds as he sets out to murder another heir) to the increasingly evident gap between Guest's charming behavior and his amoral, sociopathic narration. Part social commentary, part dark comedy, Kind Hearts and Coronets is a great little film that works on every level.

            "content": "Robert Hamer's black comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets tells the story of a would-be Duke. The protagonists mother was part of a noble family but married a commoner and her family wanted nothing to do with her. Her dying wish was to be buried in the family crypt but this was denied. As a results the protagonist vows to become duke. The problem is that he is only 11th in line to dukedom. Of the 10 people ranked ahead of him, he murders 8 of them (all played by Alec Guinness) while 2 die without his help. Just after becoming duke he is found guilty of murdering someone he did not kill. The entire story is told in flashback through the protagonist's memoirs prior to being hanged. At the end, he is acquitted because the widow of the deceased produces a suicide note. Unfortunately for the duke, as he is greeted to a bunch of cheers he remembers he has left his memoirs in his cell.\n\nThe film stars Dennis Price as the future duke Louis Mazzini and Alec Guinness as The Duke, The Banker, The Parson, The General, The Admiral, Young Ascoyne, Young Henry, Lady Agatha, and a person in an ancestor's portrait. Seeing Alec Guinnes play so many characters was kind of fun and if you didn't know any better you might not realize it is the same actor playing all of them.\n\nOverall, this was a rather fun film. You knew the main character would be in serious trouble at the end of the film, but having him convicted of killing someone he didn't kill, then be acquitted, and then forget to take his memoirs was an interesting way to do it. This isn't the most important film ever made by any stretch, but it's a nice change of pace for someone looking for something light.\n\n85/100\nB",

However, it should be pointed out, these are not grotesque exaggerations (i.e. Eddie Murphy in 'The Nutty Professor') but nuanced performances with a real through line of familiar family heredity. The plot is delicately simple, with Dennis Price (often overlooked because of the brilliance of Alex Guinness) playing a wounded descendent of the Upper Class and super-rich D'Ascoyne family, who's demeanour - when he finds out how badly his mother was shunned by having him out of wedlock - is all repressed English bile and hatred wrapped up in a smooth evil shell. He decides to kill off all eight heirs to the D'Ascoyne Dukedom, so that he can inherit the title and the fortune.\n\nThis is a brilliantly black film, with real malice and anger seeping through the comedy, as Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price) relates the tale in flashback from his prison cell awaiting execution, as he writes his extraordinary tale down on to paper so that everyone will see how and why he did what he did. The killer twist being that he's awaiting execution for the murder of the one person he didn't kill - the husband of his estranged sweetheart, Sibella (played brilliantly louche and acerbic by Joan Greenwood, with that unforgettable voice), who he spurned to marry the widow of the second D'Ascoyne family member he had murdered.\n\nIt can be slow in places but it's never dull, each vignette with a new D'Ascoyne member bringing new freshness and hilarity to this morality tale. A fleeting appearance by a very young Arthur Lowe (Captain Mainwaring in 'Dad's Army') at the end delivers another killer twist as he's set free when Sibella 'finds' a suicide note from her dead husband and he has to choose between which carriage to depart in (that of Sibella's, who has saved him from death, or that of his wife Edith, who has stood by his side without knowing what he's been doing).\n\nThis is a drawing room comedy of the kind Oscar Wilde might've written if he'd lived to an older age, with the pain of his exile and fall from grace seeping into the script. This is what Alec Guinnes should be remembered for (and why he got so annoyed with 'Star Wars' fans, who clearly only knew him for playing Obi-Wan Kenobi). A brilliant social satire with real murderous menance.",

My only real gripe--and not to be sacrilegious--is that the 60-year-old movie isn't nearly as funny as I hoped. It evokes smiles and nods rather than many big laughs.

Il film Ã¨ strutturato come un flashback: il duca Louis dâAscoyne (Dennis Price) Ã¨ in prigione, in attesa di essere giustiziato la mattina successiva, e sta scrivendo le proprie memorie, nelle quali racconta la propria ascesa alla nobiltÃ  e alla ricchezza.  Scopriamo cosÃ¬ che questi non ha esitato ad eliminare ad uno ad uno i membri del casato che lo precedevano nella successione, con una nonchalance che ricorda molto âMonsieur Verdouxâ. I suoi concorrenti sono ben otto, tutti interpretati da un grandissimo Alec Guinness, che mostra la sua versatilitÃ  comica, perfino nel ruolo di un personaggio femminile (unâesilarante suffragetta, che gira per Londra spaccando vetrine e che Ã¨ in prigione un giorno sÃ¬ e un giorno no). Ogni delitto diventa il pretesto per qualche irresistibile gag, accompagnata dalla voce fuori campo del protagonista che commenta con cinismo e formidabile aplomb ogni morte da lui provocata. Purtroppo proprio nel giorno della sua investitura a duca, il nostro simpatico assassino viene arrestatoâ¦ per un delitto che non ha commesso! Il finale Ã¨ a sorpresa.\n\nUna commedia brillante e sofisticata, deliziosamente amorale, che come ha scritto Henri Agel, Ã¨ Â«un miracoloso concorso di circostanze: lâaudacia del soggetto, il fascino dellâepoca, lâeleganza e il mordente degli interpreti, il tatto del regista, il profumo britannico dellâinsiemeÂ».

But sarcasm, faux pas and snideness are the essence of this film, and very deftly are they woven together into a comic tableaux.\r\nEveryone knows that this film is famous for putting Alec Guinness in 8 roles, though that doesn't automatically mean it's brilliant. The admiral, colonel and 'Suffragette' have barely 10 lines between them, and about as many minutes of screentime; that said, Guinness manages to individualise and personalise the rest of the D'Ascoyne's in a bravura display of characterisation. But the real plaudits must go to Dennis Price, the scheming duke-apparent who heartlessly murders 7 of his own family in a cruel opera of revenge against them for their impoverishment of his family for no reason except pride. It really does force you to consider who's worse in this scenario, but strings this thought up amidst the nigh-unbelievable goings on. Price gives a turn that outshines Guinness's, not only managing to be charismatic and almost deserving of our respect, if not our sympathy, he also convinces in several of his own disguises to off his fellow D'Ascoyne's. Credit is due to th two female leads: Hobson as the loyal, supportive Edith, and Greenwood as some sumptuously splendid crumpet.\r\nIt's a clever, outrageous and hilarious film, but too flippant and carefree. There's something uniquely post-war, uniquely British about its sober attitude that one must have an appreciation of context to fully enjoy the film. Most modern audiences would feel the motives over the top, or certainly too tame to warrant a massacre within one's own family. In any case, it may dilute but it doesn't silence the film's power and sly wit.",

This isn't really the kind of humor I generally like, I probably didn't laugh out loud once while watching this... and I still loved every minute of it. A distinctly British film with an interesting take on a theme that country has taken as one of its main literary themes: class. The film deals with the decedent of a Duke who has been ostracized by the eight snobby heir who are ahead of him. As such he decides to gain his rightful title and get revenge by killing all eight of them. This reminded me in many ways of Sweeney Todd, which had a similar darkly comic revenge theme. All eight of the relatives, including an aunt, are played by Alec Guinness in a really neat multi-role performance. Gallows humor is obviously king here, and I had a blast seeing what new way this guy would find to bump off his relatives all the way through.",

He plays all eight of the family members, from the suffragette feminist Lady Agatha dâAscoyne, to the dull and dim Reverend dâAscoyne with commendable diversity, changing his tone, stature, facial expressions and accent to play each character as if they were a completely new person. Such a performance could only prepare us for good things, which Guinness then continued to deliver.\r\n\r\nThat said, Dennis Price takes the lead excellently. As Louis Mazzini d'Ascoyne, he murders, poisons and drowns each of the characters without a sense of remorse that could seem cold and inhumane, but the audience find amusing. We eagerly await his calculation of the death of another, because we know it will have hilarious consequences, and the plot never holds back. However, his dry narration tells a story that hides a sad tinge, as well as delivering sardonic social commentary on post-war Britain, where the gold digging (played with disgusting sugariness by Joan Greenwood) women were everywhere and to some people, rank was all that mattered. This is what makes each of the deaths so comical, giving us a little glee that the snobs are getting what they deserve.\r\n\r\nFor those who donât want to watch a film for the history lesson, no fear â Kind Hearts and Coronets truly shines as a comedy. Even now, the one-liners and biting irony rings and every scene has a joke to laugh at. Under director Robert Hamerâs ultra-capable hands, a warm-hearted satire has been crafted. You really canât get much better, or much intelligent than this.",

            "content": "The Ealing films - especially the comedies are part of British film heritage. From a time when we had a British Film industry. But British film died in the 80s and it's a crying shame. Apart from the odd exception (Shane Meadows for example) the few British films that are being made now are made with an American audience in mind and/or are heavily financed with American money. But I'm not here to rant! \nKind Hearts and Coronets is by far the best of the Ealing comedies. Everyone who loves the Ealing films raves about The Ladykillers. As much as I love The Ladykillers it doesn't have the biting satire, subtlety and richness that Kind Hearts does. The Ladykillers is nearly as dark - both films have a body count that would put Quentin Tarantino to shame. But the characters in The Ladykillers are each a very broad caricature or stereotype (the spiv, the crusty old Colonel, the smart suited gangster, punch drunk boxer and so on) and it's the one thing that has always really annoyed me about the film. But I won't bash The Ladykillers. It may be over-rated but it's still pretty excellent. \nSo Kind Hearts has the edge for me. It's very much darker than it's given credit for - a comedy about a serial killer who, despite not getting away with it, you wish he had! It's also got a lot to say about class distinction and the privileges of the upper classes. So for example, when the ship's captain stubbornly goes down with his ship he looks pompous and ridiculous - becoming a figure of fun instead of the usual stiff upper lipped heroic types films had given us time and again. \nBoth Alec Guinness and Denis Price were not only great actors but had superb comic-timing. Guinness was probably one of our greatest ever film actors. I don't care who you are or how old you are, everyone has seen him and liked him in something and maybe don't even realise it. He never sold out and was starring in British film and TV right up to the end of his life. \nHe was always a bit snooty about being remembered for playing Obi -Wan Kenobi but the important thing is that he is remembered fondly! And anyway he gave gravitas and screen presence to that character and that's why the fans remember him. Will people say the same about Ewan McGregor?",

It's fun to see the hints of movies to come in this as well (American Psycho and The Ruling Class spring to mind) where you draw an enormous amount of guilty pleasure from rooting for the sociopathic anti-hero and are happy to see the upper crust finally getting what they deserve. It's social commentary told with sardonic wit. And that's the best kind of satire there is.",
