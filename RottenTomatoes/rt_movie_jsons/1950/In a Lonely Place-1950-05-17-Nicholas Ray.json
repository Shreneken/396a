So getting Bogart, Grahame and knockout-good direction was a treat. She was a stunner. Grahame was sultry and realistic (cold back then) which is hard to do unless you've got a good script and direction. \nI do wish it was longer but the double feature format of the day cut time. Maybe it cut this to its essence and paced it fast with emotions that are intense and changing. Characters show their depth one scene after another.",

For one thing, the age difference (about 27 years) between Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame is too glaring for me to think that she is genuinely in love with him, and I constantly felt that her character must be a gold-digger, interested more in the fame and riches that this successful Hollywood writer commands. And the paranoia that Bogart's character exhibits seems too staged and abrupt. I guess that's my main beef about this movie - it moves so jerkily. That, and the sterile nature of the whole film - the sets, the police, Grahame's makeup, Bogart's suits, etc. Equally disappointing was seeing the visibly aged Bogart - I never thought much of his age in \"Key Largo\", which was released only two years earlier.",

In some ways Gloria Grahame's role is even harder than Bogart's, and she plays it beautifully.  These are undoubtedly among the finest performances ever for these two actors.  After seeing the film I read that Bogart's character is a bit similar to how Bogart was in real life but very similar to Ray himself.

(childish snickering)\n\nIn a Lonely Place places its foundations in conventional noir territory, a murder investigation filled with wise cracks and West Coast locales, but differentiates itself through the far deeper exploration of the torrid relationship between Bogart's Dix and Graham's Gray. Dix is a fascinating evolution of Bogart's earlier protagonists, with plenty of the charisma and determinatiion on the surface, but revealing a volatile, flawed secondary personality that prevents him from forming relationships of any substance or length. While not wholly evil or intentionally cruel, his character is possessive, quick to anger, and demanding to the point that it is ultimately completely debilitating, and Bogart brings this extraordinarily realistic portrayal to life flawlessly. The pacing is at times somewhat erratic, and the film doesn't necessarily provide complete payoffs for many of its earlier characters (particularly the murder that instigates the plot), but is still a very relevant character study.

For me, I generally find much of the acting to be rather wooden, melodramatic, or too much like stage acting, which I feel is too overly dramatic or stilted. \nIn A Lonely Place has a great story line. Bogart is top notch as usual. Grahame is good overall, but with some particularly weak scenes, along with her rather hackneyed eyebrow raising for effect. The cheesy old fop actor Charlie is just annoying. \nBut it's Bogart portraying a man split between the Holly wood screenwriter of some renown and the 'dynamite' just waiting to explode on some poor random big mouth is what really makes the film outside of the story line itself. Also, the use of the two apartments, the one above the other where you can 'look into' the other is esp. clever. You can see into the home where movies are written; an imitation of life, of the fantasy you wish was your life, not real life with all its harshness and unpredictability. 3.4 stars",

I thrive on the tension created as the police put together the pieces, and I get to deduce what happened along with them. In a Lonely Place takes that concept and boils it down to a single mystery. We know exactly where the murder took place, we know how it was done, and there is even a limited pool of suspects. But it keeps you engaged because the single question remains if the protagonist of the film did it or not. With a great deal of skill, they shift our opinions of the protagonist back and forth, always questioning if he\u2019s been deceiving us and might be a killer. Humphrey Bogart is amazing in the lead role, and it takes a great deal of nuance to pull this off. He can look devious in one scene, and then switch to kind and loving in the next, without feeling like two different characters. That performance kept me on edge waiting for a final reveal. This is the kind of movie that keeps building the tension, all leading to a climactic moment at the end. The writers also did a great job of shifting the role of protagonist to Gloria Grahame as the evidence started to pile up against Bogart\u2019s character. We are able to experience the mystery vicariously through her, and feel the tension mounting as we suspect her life might be in danger. It\u2019s a strong film with certain scenes that will stick with me for a long time. I think where it struggles a little is in how much it vilifies the main character. There\u2019s a certain point in the film where they establish him as so dangerous and prone to violent outbursts that I wasn\u2019t sure whether it mattered if he was a killer or not. He seemed like an unstable person who should probably be avoided anyways, and that took some of the power out of the final reveal. Whether he is shown to be innocent or guilty, Gloria Grahame\u2019s character probably shouldn\u2019t be with him. I know that\u2019s the point they were trying to make at the end, but I think they made him too violent too early. It\u2019s a small complaint, because I still like the style of In a Lonely Place, and I think it\u2019s a strong murder mystery film told in a unique way.",

The plot centers around a murder that the film really doesn't care about.  We know Bogart is innocent, as does Grahame, so it's really only there to be a constant source of anxiety for Bogart ... mainly since the police won't drop the idea that maybe he did it (even though they have zero evidence).

So I was excited when I saw that Film Forum here in New York was playing the recently restored In a Lonely Place as part of their Women Crime Writers series. Here was a Bogart film I hadn't seen, and I could see it in the theater as if it was playing for the first time!\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find that, despite having watched Humphrey Bogart films since I was a kid, I had missed a truly great one.\n\nIn a Lonely Place tells the story of Dixon \"Dix\" Steele and Laurel Gray. While it is based on the novel of the same name by Dorothy B. Hughes, and while Hughes was pleased with the film, it is only loosely related to the book. Films loosely based on books is actually an ironic theme of the film, as Dix is a down-and-out screenwriter charged with the task of turning Althea Bruce into a movie. \n\nHaving not read the book, he talks to a hat check girl who did read it and takes her home to have her tell him about it. Later that night, the girl is murdered. Laurel Gray is Dix's neighbor, who happened to see Dix in his apartment the night of the murder and could thus confirm his alibi to the police.\n\nNot that this absolves Dix of all danger. He is introduced to us as a highly pugnacious sort. He picks two fights with different people not even 10 minutes into the film.\n\nLaurel doesn't suspect him, however. In fact, she even falls in love with him. She says she's never been happier in her life; Dix says she's the one he's always been looking for.\n\nBut this is precisely where the film stops being about him. Up until now, he has been the main character. He is the one \"in a lonely place,\" he is the subject of all our concern, and Laurel is, frankly, pretty uninteresting.\n\nIt switches gears, however, and now Laurel becomes the main focus, so much so that, by the end of In a Lonely Place, we don't care about Dix at all.\n\nEnter Martha, Laurel's...nurse? (It isn't clear.)\n\n\"You can't be a nurse-maid and a sweetheart, a cook and a secretary. You have to think of yourself,\" she tells Laurel.\n\nThis description turns out to be true, as we see Dix giving orders and Laurel taking them. \"You'll go when I tell you to go and not before,\" Dix says, lightheartedly. (Dix is what my wife and I would simply call, \"The Patriarchy!\")\n\nHaving watched a lot of old movies, I have sadly become accustomed to seeing blatant examples of chauvinism. In Holiday Inn, for example, Marjorie Reynolds is caught in a tug of war between Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, and who she prefers, or if she even prefers either of them, is completely beside the point. In North by Northwest, Eva Marie Saint becomes a spy for the FBI, and when Cary Grant asks why such an attractive young woman would want to do such a thing, she says it's because no man asked her to marry him.\n\nWhole movies have been ruined for me because of such blatant chauvinism. I have become used to rolling my eyes, or sighing in disappointment, or scoffing in disgust. But when I saw In a Lonely Place, I didn't do any of that. I felt like the movie was on my side, like there was a mutual understanding that what was going on was terrible.\n\nWhile the movie might at first seem primarily concerned with whether or not Dix is guilty, that is not where the suspense lies. There is no crescendo when he is being suspected, no scene of him looking over his shoulder, expecting the police. We don't see him sweating or pleading his case. This is not a movie about an innocent man fighting for justice.\n\nWhat we do see is a woman afraid for her life, reaching out to friends, asking them for help. The suspense is in worrying about Laurel's fate as we see Dix's anger explode. It's in watching her try to think of how to escape him when he asks her to marry him, and in watching her call for an airplane ticket while he's not in the room.\n\nWhile In a Lonely Place does not pass the Bechdel test, it is significantly astute in its presentation of this oppressive relationship. I would even say it was ahead of its time. The film was made in 1950. Such relationships tended to be portrayed in problematic manners.\n\nA classic example is A Streetcar Named Desire. Stanley Kowalski is portrayed as a helpless passionate type who just gets ahead of himself sometimes and explodes in rage. Stella is his support, the one he comes to when he's upset, and the one he regretfully cries to when he realizes how horrible he's been. He can't help it, and she's just got to deal with it and take care of him.\n\nIn a Lonely Place, however, resists that tendency. When Dix's agent tries to persuade Laurel not to leave, he offers precisely that broken narrative: \"He has to explode sometimes. That's just the way he is! You've got to take it all--the bad with the good.\" But we aren't compelled by this advice, and, it turns out, we're not supposed to be.\n\nThe man's contrition does not save him. The woman's concern for her own well-being is taken seriously. In a Lonely Place portrays the harsh reality of the relationship, and portrays it as something that the man cannot redeem. The emotional and physical abuse in this film is taken seriously as irredeemable violence, not kinky entertainment as it is in 50 Shades of Grey. There is no \"Stand by your man\" message here, as there is in other films.\n\nHollywood is so obsessed with happy resolutions and love stories that we often get reconciliation at the price of justice. In a Lonely Place denies us such a resolution, and it's a better movie for it.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://narrativemuse.co/movies/in-a-lonely-place, and was written by Jack Holloway.

Great dialogue, as well as a fine use of lighting and music rounds things off nicely.

            "content": "Humphrey Bogart turns in an outstanding performance in this gritty film noir about an aging screenwriter suspected of murder.  One evening he takes a young checkroom woman home with him to talk about a book, and after she leaves that night, she's strangled in a car and dumped.  His neighbor (Gloria Grahame) provides what seems to be an alibi, and then the two begin having an amorous relationship.  The police, however, continue investigating him, and they have reason to, because Bogart is quite a hothead.  He has a 'take no prisoners' approach to life, is unafraid of police questioning, and lets his fists do the talking when he flies into a rage, which he does several times.  \n\nThere is a pathos to Bogart's flaws, which seem to have doomed him to life 'in a lonely place', despite his big heart and authenticity as a person.  He just can't help himself when he does things he later regrets, and yet he \"he has to explode sometimes,\" as his agent puts it.  He always apologizes afterwards, sometimes in quiet ways, and he's also fiercely protective of friends, including an old actor with a predilection for drinking.  He's aging, fighting the system, and fighting himself.  We can't help but feel for him, even if he scares us.  Bogart's eyes in the moments when he's explaining what must have happened during the murder to his police friend and his wife are truly frightening.  It's hard to believe he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance.\n\nIn one of the most touching scenes, he's driving with Grahame and says \"I was born when she kissed me.  I died when she left me.  I lived a few weeks while she loved me.\"  They're lines he's trying to work into one of his scripts, but one senses real pain from his past.  \n\nIn another fantastic scene, the two are in the kitchen after she's read his script, and he's clumsily trying to cut her a grapefruit for breakfast.  In what defines his gruff yet tender character, after she's complemented the love scene in the script, he says \"That's because they're not always telling each other how much in love they are.  A good love scene should be about something else besides love. For instance, this one. Me fixing grapefruit, you sitting over there, dopey, half-asleep. Anyone looking at us could tell we're in love.\"\n\nGrahame falls for him, and as improbable as the romance may seem, the pair have chemistry, and play their conflicted roles well.  She shows great range as their relationship goes through stages, and without spoiling anything, I'll just say that things get difficult for her as Bogart gets erratic, and she realizes he may have committed the crime.\n\nDirector Nicholas Ray is taut in his story-telling, and there is a wonderful atmosphere to the film, such as when the two are in a nightclub sitting at a piano with other couples as Hadda Brooks performs \"I Hadn't Anyone Till You\", drinking and murmuring to one another.  \"Anything you want to make you happy?\" he asks.  \"I wouldn't want anyone but you,\" she whispers.  There is a sophistication to how people dressed and spoke in movies like this one, a coolness to the way they drank and smoked, and yet it's juxtaposed with violent passion and tragic flaws.  The overall emotional effect of the film is like a punch to the gut, and much stronger because of its revised (and apparently improvised) ending.  This is no-nonsense, fantastic film noir.",

Hughes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoteworthy Quotes:\r\n\r\nBogart:   \"I was born when she kissed me, died when she left me, loved you for a few weeks in between\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/LonelyPlaceTrailer.jpg/250px-LonelyPlaceTrailer.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n1   Although not as well known as his other work, Bogart's performance in this film is considered by many critics to be among his finest and the film's reputation itself has grown over time along with director Nicholas Ray.\r\n\r\n2   The film is now considered a classic film noir, as evidenced by its inclusion on the Time magazine \"All-Time 100 List\"[3] as well as Slant Magazine's 100 Essential Films.[4] In 2007, In a Lonely Place was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\r\n\r\n3   Louise Brooks wrote in her essay \"Humphrey and Bogey\" that she felt it was the role of Dixon Steele in this movie that came closest to the real Bogart she knew. [dames are always making money off me, one way or another--- M. Rick]\r\n\r\n4   Lauren Bacall and Ginger Rogers were considered for the role of Laurel Gray.\r\n\r\n\r\n5   Actress Grahame and director Ray's marriage was starting to come apart during filming.  Though there was a brief reconciliation, the couple divorced in 1952, when Ray found Grahame in bed with his thirteen-year-old son.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/In_a_Lonely_Place_-_trailer_-_06.png/250px-In_a_Lonely_Place_-_trailer_-_06.png[/img]  The murder method demonstrated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVEWS:\r\n\r\n1   At the time of its release in May 1950, the reviews were generally positive (in particular many critics praised Bogart and Grahame's performances), but many questioned the marketability given the bleak ending. The film was considered a box-office disappointment. \r\n\r\n2  80%\r\n One of the most morally ambiguous noir's ever made? Most probably. One of Bogart's best performance?

You betcha. \"In a lonely place\" tells you everything from its title: the depressive hard-boiled world of Hollywood where individuals are surrounded by cynicism and where two lonely individuals attempt to formulate a 'truthful' connection. However, while many of these aspects evoke the essential concepts of the noir genre, \"In a lonely a place\" is more concerned with the most difficult and complicated aspect of human intimacies: love.\r\n\r\nThe film follows Dixon Steele (Bogart), an alcoholic screenwriter who hasn't \"written a hit since before the war.\" Mostly taking place in a set that Roger Ebert describes as \"the most evocative landscape in cinema,\" Steele falls for the beautiful Gloria Grahame (Laurel Gray). While the plot seems ultimately simple, it the actors emotional portrayal of their characters that ultimately drive it. Bogart is at his best. Portraying the ultimate enigma; a man that evokes sadism and cynicism while still containing the ability to demand sympathy. Laurel's character is also trapped within a paradoxical situation: she loves a man (as this love is ultimately idealistic in such a depressive world) with utmost determination, but is ultimately suppressed due to Steele's violent anger.\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, it's the film ability at capturing the complexities of love between two conflicted humans that elevates it. And with Bogart at his best (Reflect on that: \"Bogart at his best\"), it's simply unmissable.",

Martha Stewart, as Mildred Atkinson, is a revelation. She's on screen for about ten minutes before she's murdered but she's an attractive ball of energy. The mystery surrounding her murder is supposedly the centre of the film but the plot quickly moves elsewhere, taking shots at Hollywood here, digging deep in the psyche of men's loneliness there. Proper melodrama. I haven't read the book but supposedly Nicholas Ray and his scriptwriters took liberties with the original novel by Dorothy B. Hughes and actually improved on it. I haven't read the novel, I don't know if they improved it, but I know they changed a lot of things, including the end twist. The film was released in 1950, same year as All About Eve and Sunset Boulevard. A bit like releasing an album in 1966. So its nowhere near those two masterpieces but I'm glad I've watched it.

I felt the film constantly asking, scene after scene: \"What is this man capable of?\" In this sense, it's the predecessor to (God I'm obsessed with it) Breaking Bad. Both stories create suffocating tension by hinting at the aggression behind the character in focus. Do we trust them? Do they deserve to be punished for having flaws? Do they deserve to be loved despite them? Gloria Grahame provides a nice lens for us to see this character in a different light. And, in one of the most emotionally honest scenes in a noir I've ever seen, the agent of Bogart's character says to his girlfriend: \"Years ago, I tried to make him go and see a psychiatrist. I thought he'd kill me! Always violent. Well it's as much a part of him as the color of his eyes, the shape of his head. He's Dix Steele. And if you want him, you've gotta take it all, the good with the bad. I've taken it for 20 years and I'd do it again.\"",

It doesn't leave you after it's finished though.. it stays with you for a long time. This isn't one of Bogart's better known roles, which is very sad because it should be as his acting is superb - as is everyone's. A truly thrilling mystery - great for Bogart and Grahame fans and film noir lovers.",

            "content": "Capturing Humphrey Bogart at his prime and Gloria Grahame at her sexy blonde stage (before the plastic surgery, Hollywood look), Nicholas Ray's \"In a Lonely Place\" surely is one of the best film noirs of all time.  So many other crime thrillers in the '40's/'50's had that look of the pulpy, dirty atmosphere we all enjoy, but most are so generic that it doesn't take long before we eventually forget them.  The difference with \"In a Lonely Place\" is that it takes these conventions, twists them up a little bit, and turns them into something darker, something more unique.  And every second of it works.  We're introduced to Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart), a cynical, violent Hollywood screenwriter who's close to disappearing in Tinsel Town.  After landing the chance of a lifetime, adapting a popular, trashy novel, Steele doesn't feel like doing the research, or following the story, and out of fun hires attractive hat girl Mildred Atkinson (Martha Stewart) to tell him the plot, for twenty bucks.  The next day, it is revealed that Mildred was murdered shortly after her visit with Steele.  Luckily for him, his beautiful neighbor Laurel (Gloria Grahame), provides him with an alibi, and not only is he left somewhat off the hook, but the two eventually begin a relationship.  Laurel loves Steele, and doesn't believe he committed murder at all, but after witnessing and being the victim of violence due to Steele's irrational anger, she realizes she may have put herself in an awful situation.  At first, \"In a Lonely Place\" appears to be sloppy-- scenes end quickly, and characters never get fully developed.  But by the end, it's easy to realize-- Ray wants the viewer to speculate on Steele's innocence, and it's accomplished by this.  We don't see the rest of the fateful night, and the next day starts in the afternoon: but what happens in-between? That's for us to think about it.  Though the mystery is revealed by the end, there isn't a second you aren't thrilled, or doubting your inner ideas.  Fueled by Bogart's commanding, emotional performance and Andrew Solt's supremely witty screenplay, \"In a Lonely Place\" has aged beautifully over the past sixty years.  Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Y'know what are the most painful moments in the film for me? The scenes where Dixon realizes what he's done, and tries to make up for it, or somehow deal with it. You learn that he's not thoroughly bad, just someone who in times of stress is capable of doing extremely bad things. The humanity comes through clear, without once apologizing for the man.\n\n(SPOILERS) I have a totally different reading on book and film. I thought the book a well-written example of the genre (no Hannibal Lecter cutesiness here) but when Ray translated it into the big screen he did something altogether different: he ditched the serial killer angle, turned it into a more grounded drama. Maybe it's a condition of the times, but serial killers just don't do it for me anymore; they're cartoon villains, an easy answer when asking questions about the nature of evil (it's like Ultimate Evil is supposed to be Heath Ledger in clown makeup--can be unsettling for oh, ten minutes, then you want something more substantial).\n\nFunny how Ray turns proof of Dixon's innocence into a moment of high tragedy--not an easy feat, I would imagine. I admit, you do lose the intensity and terror, but for me making him NOT guilty is ultimately more unsettling. \"Serial killer\" would have been an easy answer for what he does but for Ray he's just a man who has to live with himself and what he's capable of doing--and I say that's a harder fate to deal with than life in a mental hospital dungeon decorated with plexiglass. \"Sunset Boulevard\" for all its pleasures, is a portrait of a grotesque; \"In a Lonely Place\" the monster is recognizable, he can be any of us--in fact he's exactly like someone who used to be close to me.",
