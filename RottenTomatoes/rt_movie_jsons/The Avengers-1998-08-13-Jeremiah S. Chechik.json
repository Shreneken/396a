The producers should have known such fans would provide not an instant audience but an army of instant deplorers many of whom notoriously refused to even see the movie. What idiot producer then provides not just one unacceptable Uma, but adds a second unacceptable Uma in the bargain (Uma's dual role as both Emma Peel and nemesis)?  Poor Uma never stood a chance, given she is a notoriously verveless actress especially compared to Diana Rigg. Uma turned out to be much more suited to originating roles that she was capable of playing (see Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill). As bad an idea as casting Thurman (or anyone in a film that shouldn't have been made), there was a great idea in casting Connery as the Bondian villain and this was the only potential drawing power the film really had (it was the only reason I went to see it!).  Connery appears to be having the time of his life portraying the essence of maniacal glee. The script is awful, even if the science is not gibberish it's delivered at such breakneck speed it comes off as such.  The actors spout dialogue at each other to zero reaction, like each one is occupying a separate room. Fiennes is credible in the action scenes, but otherwise is so bland as to blend into the wallpaper. If Patrick MacNee had feared being outdone in the role, they turned out to be groundless. If you actually need a reason to watch this, there are a few good moments reminiscent of Peel-era idiosyncratic  oddball Avengers style moments, such as the Spectre-like villains meeting at a round table disguised as different colored teddy bears.",

The two head off to the Ministry to meet Mother (Jim Broadbent), who informs them the Prospero project - an attempt to influence the weather - was sabotaged apparently by Emma Peel. Dr. Peel claims she is innocent, but she is sent to work alongside Steed to find the real culprit. Mother's off-sider, Father (Fiona Shaw), claims Peel suffers from a mental disease. They go off to visit Sir August De Wynter (Sean Connery), an old ally of The Ministry. He takes an instant liking to Peel, as they both share a love of weather. Steed and Emma follow a lead to Wonderland Weather - a business that artificially creates heat or rain with a special machine - where they discover two dead men in teddy bear suits. The members of a secret organisation - led by De Wynter - all wear teddy bear suits to disguise their identities. One of them, however, looks exactly like Emma Peel. Steed arrives in time to save Peel, as the double jumps off a roof and disappears. Steed and Emma go off to visit De Wynter at his mansion but are attacked by mechanical bees. Alice (Eileen Atkins), a Ministry agent, helps them to flee; nevertheless, De Wynter captures Emma who then tries to escape but finds herself trapped due to the mansion's ever-changing floor plan. She smashes her way through a window, and Steed rescues her. Back at Steed's apartment, however, Peel is arrested by Father, as Steed visits Invisible Jones (Patrick MacNee), a man inside The Ministry, to investigate the meaning of a map Steed found at Wonderland Weather. After viewing some photos of failed genetic experiments including cloning (revealing that the other Emma Peel is a clone), Steed determines Father is working with De Wynter. Father and Peel's clone capture Peel but are confronted by Mother, who is then incapacitated. De Wynter, controlling Prospero and the weather, confronts the world's leaders. He boasts that he controls the weather, and they will have to buy the weather from him, will pay a lot for it, and will have until midnight to pay...\n\n\"The Avengers\" is a 1998 American action spy film adaptation of the British television series of the same name that ran between 1961-1969. Warner Bros., the film's distributor, refused to allow any early press-screenings for movie reviewers that most releases attempt to generate interest in; such a decision is often made when a studio and/or distributor knows a film will not be received well and pre-release reviews would only be negative. The film was originally scheduled to open earlier in June 1998 but was pushed back until August, often referred to as the late-summer \"dumping ground\" for films that are not felt to be strong or worthy enough to open on the more lucrative holiday weekends in early summer. The film was a notable failure at the box office, grossing only $48 million worldwide, compared to its budget of $60 million. Mick LaSalle, of the San Francisco Chronicle, warned against poor editing and direction, explaining; \"There's.......some business involving a dead ringer for Emma going around causing trouble, and there's some mention of the word \"cloning.\" Then all talk of that is dropped. Everything is dropped. After a slow opening, the 90-minute movie jolts into climax mode. What happened to the middle? Clearly, this wasn't just edited but gutted. No doubt they did us all a favor, but it doesn't help. Instead of just being a bad picture, the missing middle makes \"The Avengers\" a bad and weird and strangely off picture. One example: There's never a moment when Emma and Steed realize who the villain is. At first, they don't know. Next, they're in a titanic battle to the death. At one point, Emma is shackled and floating around in a hot-air balloon. I don't know how she got there. I must have blinked. Due to internal wrangling at Warner Bros., the decision was made to vastly cut down the running time after test screenings, reducing the 115-minute film to 87 minutes, sacrificing much coherence and continuity in the process. Key scenes removed included the opening sequence in which \"Mrs. Peel\" infiltrates and destroys the Prospero science installation; early trailers included the scene where she says the words \"How now brown cow\" in a false telephone box to gain admittance. The movie was originally scored by composer Michael Kamen, who included the original Avengers theme; however he was unable to re-score the film after the radical editing, so was forced to drop out. The recut version of the film was scored by Joel McNeely. The original script was used for the film's novelization and included all the material which were first shot and then removed from the film. The original cut has yet to surface; Warner Bros. has no plans to release a director's cut or special edition in any form, despite that director Jeremiah Chechik has offered to recut the film for free. The film was panned by critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes consensus reads, \"A TV spinoff that lacks enough energy to spin, The Avengers is an ineptly written, woefully miscast disaster.\" The purists disliked it for its disrespect to the original series (particularly the introduction of a romance between Steed and Peel - a carefully ambiguous subject in the series). Newcomers were lost by all of the misfired attempts to capture the mood of the original. Rod Dreher in the New York Post called the film \"a big fat gob of maximum crapulosity, the kind of shallow, stupid, big-budget cow pile that smells of Joel Schumacher\", referencing the previous summer's likewise poorly received Batman & Robin, which also starred Uma Thurman. David Bianculli stated, \"This Avengers film is so horrendously, painfully, and thoroughly awful that it gives other cinematic clunkers like Ishtar and Howard the Duck a good name.\" Jay Boyer in the Orlando Sentinel said \"The Avengers is, without a doubt, the worst movie of the summer\". Reception in Britain was equally hostile. The Birmingham Post stated \"The Avengers is being slated by critics as the worst film ever made - such a turkey, says one, that the makers should have handed distribution to (mass turkey producer) Bernard Matthews\". Alan Jones in The Radio Times stated \"The cult 1960s TV series gets royally shafted by Hollywood in this stunningly designed blockbuster that's stunningly awful in every other department... Terrible special effects and zero chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman make this notorious disaster a total waste of everyone's time and energy.\" Commenting on the truncated released cut of the film, New York Times's Janet Maslin noted, \"At a pared-down, barely rational 90 minutes, \"The Avengers\" is short but not short enough.\"\n\nI did not grow up with the original \"The Avengers\" (1961-1969) but I know of the show, the main characters and the actors. This is yet another example of a film that was slaughtered in the editing room when they reduced the 115-minute film to 87 minutes, sacrificing much coherence and continuity in the process. Everything in the film feels random, campy, poor and as said there\u00b4s no coherence nor continuity which gives us a very confusing film. With A-list stars like Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman and Sean Connery you\u00b4d think there would be potential, but the end result is far from it. All three seems to have no idea what\u00b4s going on due to mediocre direction. I reckon charm, style and fun was the main pillars of the tv-show, but with the film all of that is not in place. It\u00b4s a weird and strange unfunny film in many ways and you really struggle to find anything that is good about it. The effects are shoddy and the script silly in an Austin Powers way. Once the colourful teddybears appears in the film you realise that this film will never recover. \n\nTrivia: Peter Bart's book \"The Gross\" covered the film's unfolding disaster in great detail. Among other facts: Warner Brothers greenlit the film largely on the strength of a star-packed cast and their appreciation of Jeremiah Chechik's work on Diabolique (1996) and were horrified when seeing what the first cut was like. The first screening took place in front of a \"largely Spanish-speaking, working class\" audience in Phoenix, Arizona, who hated the film; the studio then forced Chechik to cut many of his favorite scenes, and conduct reshoots; and the final cut went from 115 to 89 minutes, and was completely incoherent. The studio even refused to hold further test screenings, or to have an official premiere before the film's August 1998 release. Ralph Fiennes said of the film, \"I think it's a badge of honor to have a real flop on your resum\u00e9\".",

I didn't feel It had much connection with the '60s TV series with Diana Rigg (a far better Emma Peel than Uma Thurman) and Patrick Macnee. Fiennes handled the role of John Steed very well, as well as the script allowed anyhow. Sean Connery is the villain and he's good as always, again, within the confines of the script. Two things made me go \"oh brother\":  the giant mechanical bumble bees and Steed kissing Peel. This last thing NEVER would have happened in the original TV series, though the tension was always there. There's other stuff that bugged me too, but I'll stop here.

Instead, they ruin everything by trying to do too much.  Forcing an evil cloned Emma Peel, a boardroom of evil teddy bears, mechanical bees, and a random unexplained man of mystery (Eddie Izzard) were all painful mistakes. All of these scenes should have been given to Connery to build his character and make a more coherent story. The movie wrongfully puts all of its chips on the playful banter between Steed and Mrs Peel. This may have been the charm of the 60s TV show but it feels very forced and unnatural here. Ralph Fiennes was an alright Steed but Uma Therman was too cold and mechanical for her part. They just do not have the chemistry that was essential to make this work.

That said, I found this celluloid adaptation to be, though not great and certainly not excellent, a somewhat amusing spy spoof in the vein of \"Get Smart.\"\nLet's start with the positives: By far, the best thing about \"The Avengers\" are some of the crazy visuals.  I don't want to give away too much, but I will say that they're things few denizens of this planet will ever see elsewhere, which is part of what makes movies in general fun and entertaining.  Also, \"The Avengers\" may have been rated \"PG-13,\" but it barely deserved it.  The violence was largely bloodless and very much in the style of a \"TV-Y7-FV\" Saturday morning show; about as sexual as it got was seeing a man's backside; and, there was very little profanity.  Even Uma Thurman (\"Kill Bill\") stayed fully clothed throughout the film.  Speaking of her, she and her co-stars, Sean Connery (a former \"James Bond\") and Ralph Fiennes (\"Harry Potter\") did very well in the movie.\nHowever, there were some significant issues that kept this one from being a winner: First off, despite posing as a spy spoof and having a smattering of humor, \"The Avengers\" wasn't as funny as it could have been.  I really expected to laugh a lot more than I did.  Additionally, despite the content being mostly clean, smoking was in overabundance in the film.  The film's hour-and-a-half running time felt longer than it was, and that wasn't a good sign.\nSo, my thoughts? If you're an Anglophile and have yet to see this, you should at least rent it just to say that you have seen it.  Those who couldn't care less about British media should just stay away; seriously, as insane as the visuals are in \"The Avengers,\" it's not worth sitting through the rest of the film.",

Ralph fiennes plays an average John Steed; though I have to wonder how the movie would've done with Tom Wilkinson instead, as well as with a bit more snappy humor. Uma Thurman portrays Emma Peel not quite as spot-on as Diana Rigg, but oh well. At least Patrick Macnee (the original John Steed) makes a brief cameo as Invisible Jones, which is enough to add some positive props to the film's structure. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the makers of this movie attempted to revive the series by combining the old with the new, which is a lot more than The Wild Wild West, Lost in Space, and The A-Team can say for themselves. \"Rain or shine, all is MINE!\" -Sir August De Wynter.",

The film takes a turn with the introduction of Sean Connery, not a bad choice for the villain but he is very one dimensional. The teddy bear scene is quite inspired but this is a prime example of a hybrid weirdness that doesn't float well, the film is lost within its own ambitions, maybe atudio interference. I have heard that the film was cut heavily and you can't fault the director if the studio abandoned the filmmaker, if it was terrible and left alone by the studio, by all means we throw blame at the director. The film is cut badly and shifts all around the place and is another Warner Bros tv remake that is terrible, Wild Wild West is about on par and never captures the campiness it needed to succeed.

I just think it's a very fun, classic late-90's Bond-esque action/adventure flick that has some pretty good production values. Plus, Joel McNeely provides an excellent score (specifically the movie's main title, as well as his reorchestrations of the original theme from \"The Avengers\") that I think would make him the perfect replacement for David Arnold if, heavens forbid, Arnold ever stepped down (remember he said he was going to? He said it, I BELIEVE after both \"Die Another Day\" and \"Casino Royale\", but he ended up coming back, which I'm glad he did). \r\n\r\nThat said, I do understand the film's week points. I think a lot of the negativity of the film comes from the script. The thing is: the script is almost perfect.... for a TV episode of \"The Avengers\". The writer(s) does a wonderful job (for the most part) of capturing the dialogue style of the original TV series. However, the problem is... this isn't a TV series episode. This is a motion picture. And dialogue that works for a television episode just doesn't translate well on the big screen. So this is, I think, the film's biggest flaw. \r\n\r\nAnother thing is that, THOUGH I admit I do adapt to them throughout the movie, I still think that Uma Thurman and especially Ralph Fiennes were two of the weirdest choices for Steed and Emma Peel. Ralph Fiennes almost can't be taken seriously at first because he is just so small and frail, like he almost looks like a little kid in an oversized suit. And Uma Thurman I've just never really been a big fan of. But again, they do grow on me throughout the movie.\r\n\r\nAlways a pleasure to watch a movie with Sean Connery in it... However, this is not one of my favorite Sean Connery movies for the pure and simple reason of: ...I don't like seeing him as a bad guy. Sean Connery should never play a bad guy. Not because he is bad at doing so! Quite the contrary! But based solely on his cool factor and how much I like him... he must always play a good guy. Forever.\r\n\r\nI think one of the weirdest things is that I really feel like he looks older in \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" than he does in any of his mid-to-late 90's films.\r\n\r\nI know.. that doesn't really have anything to do with anything. But...\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, yeah... Definitely can understand some of the reasons for the negative ratings. But I really do love this movie. The TV Series is BETTER, of course (The '67 Series is still my favorite), but the movie really is fun.",

Connery, turning in a forgettable performance in a forgettable role, isn't an even slightly interesting bad guy.
