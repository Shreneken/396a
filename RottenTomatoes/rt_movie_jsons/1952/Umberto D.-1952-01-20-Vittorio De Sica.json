    "summary": "When elderly pensioner Umberto Domenico Ferrari (Carlo Battisti) returns to his boarding house from a protest calling for a hike in old-age pensions, his landlady (Lina Gennari) demands her 15,000-lire rent by the end of the month or he and his small dog will be turned out onto the street. Unable to get the money in time, Umberto fakes illness to get sent to a hospital, giving his beloved dog to the landlady's pregnant and abandoned maid (Maria-Pia Casilio) for temporary safekeeping.",

            "content": "Vittorio de Seca was a master of the neorealist style and Umberto D. is one of his many, some argue the greatest, masterpieces. The key to the neorealist movement was in utilizing real life locations and mostly ordinary people in the prominent roles. Umberto D. is played by Carlo Battisti, who was a professor and this is the only film he was featured in but yet what a wonderful performance! Battisti gives such a multifaceted portrayal of the character that you really feel for the down-and-out side but also cheer on the stubborn and prideful side too. The story itself isn't overly complex but rather tells a straight forward narrative following Umberto D. and his trusty companion, whom seems to be the only stability in his life. We see how Umberto's life has been going downward since his retirement and his surmounting back-rent forces his landlady to kick him out (in reality she simply wants to do some improvements to the house and needs his room). We then see him trying to catch a break and get the money in order to keep his room by selling his belongings, all of which the viewer knows is pointless as she wants him out, and thus setting him back all the more. Umberto after coming to this realization that he has lost his home and livelihood as well as any pride he once had, has two choices left. He can either end it all by committing suicide or carrying on into the unknown future with very little to his name, simply his dog for company. The ending can be bittersweet as there is hope but amongst a lot of hopelessness and gloom. The film is simply terrific in telling a profoundly moving story and one of the crowning jewels of the neorealist movement!",

            "content": "One of the masterpieces of the Italian neorealist movement, Vittorio De Sica's Umberto D. tells the story of Umberto, a retired civil servant trying to adjust to life in post-war Rome.  Abandoned by his colleagues, struggling to survive on a meager pension, and battling with his landlord to avoid eviction from his rundown apartment, he finds that his only friend is his faithful dog, who remains by his side regardless of the hardships experienced.   Featuring some beautiful cinematography and strong performances from its primarily amateur cast, Umberto D. is a film about survival in a changing world and finding companionship in a community uninterested in establishing relationships.  It is filled with memorable moments, including the final touching scene where Umberto looks for a home for his faithful dog.  Umberto D. is must see viewing for anyone interested in classic cinema.",

If what I've described here sounds like pretty strong stuff, such is the crux of what makes the film great as well a trifle challenging. We genuinely care about the trials of this duo because their affection for one another and their efforts to contend determinedly with their daily travails are heightened by a refreshing absence of manipulative artifice; we peer into their harsh world as though looking directly into our own. In the form of \"Umberto D\" we are thus given a touching portrait of everything that the neorealist movement stood for, leaving us astounded by an experience that both enchants and hurts because it cuts so undeniably closely to the bone.",

On one hand you can sympathize with the Main Characters ,but their personal stories merely scratch the surface. \nNothing is ever revealed about anyone's past background. Nor do we see much more than  mere daily struggles to keep a room\nand board. I would have liked to know more about Umberto and Maria's background or even a future outcome. Another major flaw with this movie was the sloppy cutscenes that jumped from one dialogue to an entirely different scene. If it wasn't hard enough keeping up with a foreign language film ,their conversations were too impersonal. Every time it appeared to have a heartfelt moment we are immediately catapulted back into a pointless scenario.It was just not an enjoyable viewing experience or had much of a point that reached a conclusive end.",

Through the interactions with the characters he encounters, we glimpses into his psychological turmoil; a tug of war in which on one side is his pride, and staying alive on the other. The story is dense and lean in an almost economic way, with little excess. But the meat of the matter lies in the slow burn build up to Umberto's suicide attempt. Most of the actions throughout the film seems to have no grandeur. Characters mostly hang around waiting for something, doing routinal things, but loomed over by the shadow of some invisible force of their own fate, pulling from inside, the unknown that is their future. This is perhaps the juxtaposition that prominently characterizes neo-realism. \n\nWhat's most notable is that the actor for Umberto's role wasn't a professional actor. Yet the performance turns out to be one that is relatable and sincere. It is somewhere in that authenticity and almost vulnerability that made the film all the more urgent and emotional.",

            "content": "It's Rule Number One of film: you get a dog involved in a sincere drama without coming off as silly, and you've got a guaranteed critical following. Like De Sica's earlier Bicycle Thieves, Umberto D. focuses on silent suffering, very human plights that feel tangible, often existing just below the surface of society's accomplishments, victims that exist as a result of weaknesses of everyday life that people would rather pretend did not exist. The film taps into a deep-seated, universal fear - the unknown associated with age, feelings of uselessness, and a lack of love; though it clearly taps into bleak aspects of life in post-WWII Europe, its themes are universal. What could have been a powerful-but-predictable piece on human suffering and isolation is instead completely reoriented with moments of pure joy in the midst of all the misfortune, and an ending that is so hopeful that it's downright devastating. There is consideration of the balance between shame and survival in a modern setting that is just as compelling as the more overt emotional exploration between Umberto, his dog, and Maria, the girl whose pregnancy without a husband means she is living on borrowed time in her position. A great piece of Neorealist cinema that is brought out by one of the incredible performances from a movement famed for its use of nonprofessional actors; Battisti is stunning, and can portray his character's fury and withdrawn moments with great care. But this was his sole performance, so like Harper Lee, we're left wondering what if. (4.5/5)",

His angered protests to the Italian government about the cavalier treatment afforded him and his fellow senior citizens fall upon deaf ears.\n\nSo I'm in world cinema, a class at my film school. Each week, we're supposed to watch one movie that's considered a classic. Many of these films thrived in times of neorealism, French New Wave, Japanese realism, and more. \"Umberto D.\" was one of the first films we watched.\n\nBack then, the way films were shot stylistically were so much different than they are today. \"Umberto D.\" was shot with many long, lingering takes and not many cuts. Its black & white film makes this film visually appealing. The lack of cuts and rapid editing allows us, the audience, to experience all the emotion we need to in minimal takes. \n\nThe character of Umberto is really what made this film. The film depicted a lifestyle of the lower class in order to show people the severity and difficulties that many faced. Umberto is the average citizen, too proud to beg but too old to work a meaningful job. He's stuck in a dead end and we watch his struggles and how it defines him as a person within civilization.\n\nIn the end, \"Umberto D.\" was a great film. I'm sure it's on the Criterion Collection but if not, I know it's available at a small price for streaming.",

Directed by one of its main exponents Vittorio De Sica and written by one of the best screenwriters of the period Cesare Zavattini, this is the painstaking story of an old man with all kinds of problems from health to financial and who struggles to survive the overall bleakness of his existence. This wave of realism is full of humanity but does not spare the viewer from the dark side of the faithful portrayal of its settings and its characters. De Sica is great at making sure that all the elements of the story and of the production are in perfect harmony with one another, from the music to the cast entirely made up of real people from the streets. Umberto D. is gerenally rightfully considered De Sica's best work alongside Bicycle Thieves and certainly a powerful age defining and influential and haunting representation of the everyday struggle of the people that society tends to forget and the people whose existence is all too blatantly ignored by society.",

            "content": "The neorealist movement began in Italy at the end of World War II as an urgent response to the political turmoil and desperate economic conditions afflicting the country. Directors such as Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, and Luchino Visconti took up cameras to focus on lower-class characters and their concerns, using nonprofessional actors, outdoor shooting, (necessarily) very small budgets, and a realist aesthetic. The best-known examples remain De Sica's Bicycle Thieves, a critical and popular phenomenon that opened the world's eyes to this movement, and such key earlier works as Rossellini's Open City, the first major neorealist production. Other classics of neorealism include De Sica's Umberto D. and Visconti's La terra trema, but the tendrils of the movement reach back to De Sica's The Children Are Watching Us and forward to Rossellini's The Flowers of St. Francis, as well as to some filmmakers who did their apprenticeships in this school, Michelangelo Antonioni and Federico Fellini",

Both films deal with abuse in one form or another. In Balthazar, the donkey is the central character that is undergoing the predominant amount of abuse throughout the film but the side character, Marie, is physically and emotionally abused in certain scenes in the film as well. In Umberto, Umberto himself is the central character who receives unsympathetic abuse from his landlady, society, certain friends, even the government. Umberto's dog, Flike, also undergoes abuse from society and, to a certain extent, Umberto, even though he doesn't mean to. Both films deal with different themes but both speak volumes about the concept of innocence in humans as it is in animals. Do humans abuse animals as they abuse each other? Do they feel more sympathy toward one more so than the other? Of course both these films deal with many other themes and political/social statements, but this is simply what I walked away with.",

Upon seeing it almost seemed like a continuation of Vittorio De Sica's other hit \"The Bicycle Thief\"/ \"The Bicycle Thieves\" made in 1948 except that instead of a young man, we are taken under the wing of an elderly person and his name is Umberto Domenico Ferrari playing with a \"subtley\" performance by Carlo Battisti hence the title. He's living with his pension renting from a landlady who appears to overcharge him as opposed to living somewhere else- it is obvious to the audience that she's doing anything she can to get rid of him but as a result of his pride he stands firmly tall refusing to move anywhere else, and also because he's stayed their for a long time and it may not be easy to just live somewhere else.  It is evident that he needs money and throughout the film we the audience get to witness Umberto's daily life as he struggles takes us day to day, and it is not the most appealing for at times it's hard to sympathize with him if he doesn't want to adapt, for instance theirs a scene somewhere during the film where upon looking at a successful begger and he contemplates trying it but decides that he is way too proud and makes his dog Filip to do it instead ducking somewhere and instructing him to hold up his hat but of course fails.  One other point is that they're alot of \"nuances\" that will not be apparent to first time movie watchers, but demands repeated viewings to all others because they're plenty.\r\n\r\nIt is said to be the director Vittorio De Sica's personal favorite film he's ever made since the movie's title Umberto is really his father's name and it was his dad that encouraged him to make it as well. The Italian government at the time even refused to be shown overseas since he almost felt that it was personal attack on him and the rules that's been laid out.  \r\n\r\n3 out of 4",

            "content": "Vittorio DeSica's wonderful \"Umberto D\" was one of the last films of the Italian neo-realism movement and by far its best one. It is also one of my favorite movies ever.\nThe movie's premise is simple: it is a slice of the life of a poor lonely pensioner, Umberto. Throughout the movie, we see Umberto struggle to find money to pay rent to his horrible landlady, love his dog Flike, and deal with the loneliness and disillusionment of the postwar era.\n\"Umberto D\" is a character-driven film. It works very well because of its sharp observations on loneliness and poignant gestures. The gestures evoke powerful feelings without necessitating dialogue. Many of the scenes, even the ones that do not necessarily advance the plot, are hypnotically beautiful in their simplicity. Take, for example, a beautiful scene where Umberto finally needs to beg for money but cannot physically bring himself to do it. He extends his palm up, but when a passer-by stops to give him money, Umberto quickly flips his hand over, as if testing for rain. The film is full of these small gestures that quietly emphasize the desperate loneliness and poignancy of Umberto's situation.\nThe acting in this film is absolutely superb. Carlo Battisti, despite having never acted before, is wonderful as the titular character; his face is a fascinating blend of stubborn dignity and weariness of life. Maria Pia-Casilio, who plays the maid, is just as good as evoking life's loneliness and quiet desperation. The supporting cast is also very strong.\nOne of the very few criticisms I have heard of this film is that it is too sentimental and borderline sappy. While some scenes with Umberto and his dog Flike are sentimental, never is it \"too\" sentimental. DeSica knows how far he can push his film without making it sappy, and he wisely shows it as it is. Nothing feels forced. The subject material itself and the simplicity in which it is presented will bring tears. (If you don't cry in this movie, you need to have your heart professionally de-thawed.) But \"Umberto D\" is never dumbed down into sappiness and clich\u00e9d corniness. It is a very powerful film.\n\"Umberto D\" is the masterpiece of the Italian neo-realist era. It's a rather bleak and very realistic movie, but it makes some fascinating commentary on the human condition, specifically the loneliness we face. Highly, highly recommended.",
