    "summary": "After religious spinster's (Katharine Hepburn) missionary brother is killed in WWI Africa, dissolute steamer captain (Humphrey Bogart) offers her safe passage. She's not satisfied so she persuades him to destroy a German gunboat. The two spend most of their time fighting with each other rather than the Germans. Time alone on the river leads to love.",

There's comedy, drama, excellent acting and the scenery is very real. Charlie looks like a rough drunkard, but turns out to be a sweet gentleman.  Rosie is a stout hearted, strong female character who takes no guff but, is also very sweet. They find adventure together under unfortunate circumstances that eventually lead to heroic acts which help in the war.",

The performances are pretty good for the most part, although there were one or two moments which I felt were a little over the top.\n\nOh and then there's a scene near the start, whereby Charlie is suffering from a very noisy stomach while dining with the upper classes - something I've often felt self conscious about (although not specifically being in the company of upper class people, mind you), so I could certainly feel his embarrassment then!.\n\nIts mostly an enjoyable watch, with good performances and some good cinematography, so I'd recommend it overall.",

The Huston/Agee script was actually much sharper than I'd have expected given the fun tone of the movie. This demonstrates Agees admirable range as a writer and runs counter to my experience with him as a novelist (A Death In The Family), where the tone and subject matter were inversely darker than those found in this film. This film probably wouldn't have worked so well without two of the strongest possible leads to carry what is essentially a two person film, as Bogart and Hepburn are always a joy to watch. This is probably also another case of my inflation of a rating bc of the influence I recognize a film has had on those from the same genre coming after it.",

The chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn seems genuine and the Africa setting is beautiful.  It's understandable how it was revered when originally released, but some aspects of the film have not aged well.  The music score is overbearing at times.  The acting leans towards corny, as evidenced by Bogart's animal imitations.  The special effects (check out the mosquito attack) are laughable, but typical of the era.  All in all, if watched through a 1950s lens, it's more than passable entertainment.",

Did they ever happen to make a movie together? Yes, they did. Was it any good? You bet your ass! \n\nThe African Queen is a rousing tale of adventure and romance with two unlikely companions. Bogie plays a steamboat captain who agrees to take Robert Morley's sister, The Great Kate, back to civilization during the onset of World War I. In the process, they must fight for survival along treacherous waters.\n\nThe gin-guzzling riverboat captain is a great counter to the strait-laced missionary and the two stars make this a ride to remember. Besides the performances, the script probably shines the most. James Agee and John Huston, who also directed, have a great knack for writing crisp and smooth interplay between the two leads.\n\nThere aren't very many supporting roles in this movie, but Robert Morley makes the best of his small performance. He's actually quite memorable and he hearkens back to supporting players of older Bogart movies like Sidney Greenstreet.\n\nBoth leads received well deserved Oscar nominations and Humphrey Bogart finally won his big award. That should tell you that I'm not the only one who thought this movie was excellent. If you like stirring action with great chemistry from the stars, then you'll love The African Queen.",

Although an uneven ride at moments, especially the all too bouncy score, the result is strangely gripping and enduringly entertaining as the film bucks the sexist, agist, and colonialist expectations of its time with a sly sense not only of its technical achievement, but, thanks to the on their face phony performances of Hepburn and Bogart, a winking and artificial self-parody of the effort.",

I did not buy the transition of these characters from strangers to lovers, especially given the supposed spiritual roots of Katherine Hepburn's character. The most excitement happened during the rafting scenes, which comprised about 5 total minutes of the 1 hour, 45 minute snoozefest.

As they escape the WWI-era Germans down the Ubangi river in Bogie's ramshackle (and titular) boat, they need to work together to overcome many challenges (an enemy fort on the shore, a series of rapids, a broken propeller, an endless shallow and muddy river of reeds).  Bogie is rather rough and loves his gin whereas Kate is prim, religious, and a bit of a prude.  But as they fall in love, they compromise - this is a gentle older person's companionate love.  And they cook up a plan to blow up a big German warship patrolling an African river.  It's fun and the music (by Allan Gray) is jaunty and almost comical at times.  Of course, Huston notoriously shot this on location and engaged in big game hunting and lots of drinking during their stay in Africa.   Lauren Bacall (who doesn't appear in the film) was along to look after Bogie who apparently hated the shoot but won an Oscar.  To my mind, The African Queen is lighter fare, potentially even for kids (who are old enough to understand war); I would have preferred things to be a bit edgier but there is no doubt that the film belongs in the canon just for the unique pairing of the stars alone.",

            "content": "My review focuses on the symbolism of the movie and on the characters, not on the plot. In the movie, \"Rose\" (Kathrin Hepburn) starts off as an uptight missionary woman, a clever but controlling woman. Throughout their ride down the river she controls everything that happens on the \"African Queen\" boat which is symbolized by her steering the boat throughout their trip and early on in their voyage by her emptying \"Charlie's\" (Humphrey Bogart) liquor into the river because he had exploded in anger and called her names in his drunken stupor. She later loosens up and reveals herself as \"Rosie\", an adventurous woman full of passion and courage and love who works just as hard for survival as Charlie does. Charlie shows himself to be an easy going guy who falls for her and agrees to go along with her wishes even if it means risking their lives. He has a double dose of courage in that he takes on all the challenges of the African jungle without complaining much and he takes on a headstrong woman and opens his heart to her. The movie's main message has little to do with Africa or the war. In fact, their rocky ride is symbolic of what happens in romantic relationships, and makes a statement that a good team is not one with perfect people, but one in which people accept each other the way they are, forgive each other and say I am sorry (Rosie later apologizes for throwing out his Gin), who know how to listen to each other, who put all their effort to help each other get out of a bad situation and who let that person steer (the boat) who has a bigger ability at saving them (or the relationship). And although their trip is full of challenges, they learn to laugh a lot and to enjoy the adventure. Because that is what decides if a relationship becomes a joyous adventure or a hard struggle: good teamwork.",

So sweet to see how their relationship progresses and how comfortable they become with each other.\n\nPretty damn good effects being used that are well ahead of it's time. I really like that they filmed in Africa. \n\nOverall, pretty good adventure and romance move. Though not my cup of tea, I found the chemistry and acting interesting.

As a result they decide to retaliate by using the riverboat as a weapon to try and sink a German warship. Not enough can be said about the performances from Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. I don't think I'm spoiling much by saying that over time they fall in love (you can kind of see that coming from their very first scene together because the movies love opposites-attract relationships.) What was remarkable about their performances in The African Queen is that I actually bought it. While there was indeed one moment when they suddenly began to kiss and they spoke differently to one another from then on, I actually saw the slow progression leading up to that point so they earned that breakthrough moment. It felt right, as though they were 2 people genuinely forming a connection as they struggle through this difficult ordeal. You probably couldn't get away with this in modern cinema, but it was also a treat to see this love story take place between an older couple who were covered in dirt and grime half the time. It gave the story a more authentic feeling, as opposed to the young hot bodies they would feel compelled to use nowadays.\n\nThe entire film is kind of episodic. As they travel down the river they go through one ordeal, conquer it, and then move on to the next. Some of these scenes are more interesting than others, but I have particular affinity for the ones that deepen the relationship between the two characters. One of the oddest choices that they made in the movie is that almost every sentence the 2 characters say to one another is preceded by the name (or some other title) for the person they are addressing. It just seems so strange hearing \"Mr. Allnut\" about 50 times in a matter of 30 minutes of film. It could be somewhat grating on the nerves, particularly since it's just 2 people. I think they make that pay off by having their titles for each other slowly transition into more endearing terms, but they went a little overboard. The story's conclusion also feels a bit far-fetched and convenient, but it is one of those endings that makes you all warm and fuzzy, so I don't mind. It's also worth mentioning that, considering the available technology of the time, some of the shots they captured are spectacular. There is one zoom out that is simply amazing and tells so much without using a word. Even the rear-projection backgrounds are hidden relatively well. The African Queen is a classic film that I can strongly recommend, because I think the story holds up, and the acting is just what you need in a film that is almost entirely 2 people alone floating down the river.",

Samuel Sayer (Morley) and his sister Rose (Hepburn) in the 1st Methodist Church in Kungdu, which reeks of condescending Pharisaism since none of the locals have a clue of what they are parroting, and the unhealthy allusion of them to a bunch of predators when the boat owner Charlie's (Bogart) unfinished cigarette is up for grabs doesn't ameliorate the revulsion albeit its intention of being funny, nevertheless Bogart's belly is just as musical as his singing. \n\nLuckily soon we embark on an adventure strictly includes only Rose and Charlie, it's never too late to fall in love, after the initial distinction around Rose's starry-eyed strategy, the flame of romance is kindled during a perilous passage with rapids. The thrill of riding the waves must stir up an old maiden's passion, the two-hander between Bogart and Hepburn is tremendously entertaining to watch, Bogart plays against his usual detached sangfroid, totally unreserved as a down-to-earth ilk, it is quite refreshing to know this role capped him an Oscar statue, when he imitates a roaring hippopotamus, the joy is tangible and it is a precious moment for Boart's screen image; Hepburn is at the top of her game as well, her appellation to Charlie changed from Mr. Allnut to dear is handled with a heartwarming vignette, and she is also the trailblazer who pioneers a progressive view as a fearless woman, challenges Bogart to the final assail gallantly meanwhile her tender moment with the man she loved is truly touching. The film is also a taxing endeavor in a physical sense, frowzily dressed under the sizzler, all the river turbulence they have to endure (although it is too dangerous to be shoot live on-set, the post-produced and recreated effect is just passable), slogging through the reed-rampant water area by trawling the boat manually, not to mention the fake mosquitoes and leeches (most of the crew were under the weather during the shooting). \n\nNear the coda, Houston deftly injects some gallows humor into their capture by the German navy, but the final twist is merely ludicrous, the capsize is exerted with a slapdash hurry, anyway, it is a genuine romantic exploit can woo a massive fun-seeking, love-hankering viewers plus many non-German patriots and for Huston and his team, it was a lavish hunt for novelty paid by the company and the inception of a long-standing friendship between Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn.",

After Rose's life as the maiden-lady sister of a missionary comes to close after 10 years of servitude,  she sees her one chance to live to the fullest.  Her ideas make little sense and she breaks-in her companion like one would a horse. Something that seems like love happens to them, but it is entirely situational and relies on Rose's dominating persona. All the while, Charlie is given something he believes to be a purpose. In the end, they both seem to come together and \"be in love\" due to the magic of Stockholm syndrome. As the fiim ends, they seem to have lost all semblance of self (and sanity). While I doubt the film was made with said intentions, it works as a sad commentary on repression and the absurdity of the missionaries. Once havoc hits the African village, their shallow \"care\" for the natives is not only abandoned, but completely unaddressed. This film, in my opinion, works best when viewed through modern eyes...it's real pretty though. :P",

Once you've seen the shenanigans that accompanied the putting together of this picture, it becomes all the more enchanting. (One wonders how Huston was convinced to film pieces of it in England, however, since he insisted on shooting the whole thing in Africa, and Viertel didn't elucidate that point in the film version of WHBH; if it's in the book I haven't gotten that far yet.)\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the plot (if you've been living in a cave for the last fifty years): A missionary (Robert Morley) and his strait-laced sister (Hepburn) are ministering to natives in what was known in 1918 as German East Africa (at the time of the film it was known as the Belgian Congo, and is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo... you get the idea). The village is burned down by the German occupiers, the missionary dies, and his sister hitches a ride back to civilization with the mail carrier The African Queen, piloted by the hard-drinking Charlie Olnutt (Bogey). Bogey and Hepburn, of course, wind up in a classic romance plot, fighting like cats and dogs until they wind up falling in love.\n\nThe beginning of the film is godawfully overacted, mostly by Robert Morley (but the look on Katherine Hepburn's face when she realizes the village is on fire is straight out of a bad silent film). It improves once Bogart and Hepburn are stuck on the boat; Hepburn seems to get more into character, and the chemistry between the two is fabulous. It is, and deserves to be, considered an American classic. ****",

On their journey thye battle the elements including mosquitos, leeches, rapids and marshy waters. As often is the case in the movies, proximity sparks romance. The plot is rather simplistic and is more about watching this couple survive on an African river. There are no interesting twists in the plot like Anaconda (1997), where the characters go crazy or start turning on each other or anything like that. The movie does have some nice nature photography for the parts filmed on location in Africa, which was probably innovative when the movie came out. This isn't my favorite Bogart role, as I prefer seeing him in more dapper roles, for lack of a better word, like in \"The Maltese Falcon\" (1941) or \"Casablanca\" (1942). But this movie does show his ability to play diverse roles, and he did win the Academy Award for Best Actor for this film.

            "content": "\"This boat's only big for the two of us.\"\n\nThe American Film Institute named Humphrey Bogart the greatest film actor of all-time. For the greatest actress, the AFI gave that title to Katherine Hepburn. But what happens when you put two highly acclaimed stars, put them in a film made by John Huston (of Maltese Falcon fame) about an unlikely couple teaming up on a boat? Well, what comes out is a delightful, funny, moving, touching, and wonderful drama/comedy/adventure, whatever you call it.\n\nKatherine Hepburn plays Rose Sayer, who lives in Africa during WWI with her missionary brother (Robert Morley). Humphrey Bogart plays Charlie Allnut, the captain of the steam boat The African Queen, who regularly provides African villagers with supplies. When Germans destroy the village and lead to the mad death of the missionary brother, Rose teams up with Charlie and together, ride the African rivers in the boat. At first, Rose can't stand Charlie's ugly looks and drinking problems (in this case, gin), but as the voyage progresses, the two start falling in love and work together to survive the waters and develop ideas to destroy German ships.\n\nJohn Huston is one of my all-time favorite directors, making such classics as The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and Key Largo. The African Queen, on the other hand deserves to join the Huston classics list. Why? Cause it's just so fun to watch.\n\nThe African Queen was an introduction to many involved, particularly Huston and Bogart, to the world of Technicolor. The colors are simply beautiful. What helps is the great decision of Huston deciding to film it in Africa itself. The result are colors that wow in every shot and cinematography that takes the breath out of every individual who watches. I particularly enjoyed looking at shots of some of the creatures in Africa; the crocodiles, the hippos, and some deadlier than others.\n\nEveryone knows how talented of an actor Humphrey Bogart is. Bogart delights in films like Casablanca, and even some of Huston's other works that I've already mentioned. Bogart won an Oscar for his role as Charlie the crazy captain of the African Queen, and it's well-deserved. When you think of a good romantic partner for Bogart, you instantly think of ladies like Ingrid Bergman or Lauren Bacall, but here, that lady is Katharine Hepburn. Thankfully, Hepburn is not a miscast and her chemistry with Bogart is strong. I enjoyed the comedic remarks at each other and the romance delivers. \n\nOne little thing against this film, and it's that there's not a huge cast to praise. There's only Bogart, Hepburn, and Robert Morley as the missionary, but Morley was only in the first ten minutes. The best movies have big casts in them, but The African Queen has too few stars. I know I'm knitpicking, but it really bothered me.\n\nI enjoyed the adventurous story, especially in the last 30 minutes or so, where the couple has to survive the jungles. I loved the romantic and comedic aspects of the film. I was wowed by the glorious colors seen in the film. While I was displeased with a lack in a giant cast, which I'll probably have negative votes on, the story and Bogart and Hepburn's performances make up for it, making The African Queen a classic worth watching. While Casablanca and Bringing Up Baby are definitely the definitive films from Bogart and Hepburn, putting the two together was a smart idea, and Huston delivered in making The African Queen a fun film.",

And is also clearly done on a low budget, and yet it still hits its entertainment value well.\nThe story in The African Queen is a simple one about an adventure two characters embark on, and it truly has the feel of a classic adventure theme since the atmosphere is intense at times and the musical score feels really convincing to the jungle adventure genre that the film entails. It's not hard to see what makes The African Queen a classic.\nThanks to John Huston's direction it all feels very genuine. The adventure proves to he an interesting one and even a thrilling one in The African Queen, and it is full of fine quality cinematography and beautiful scenery which makes it feel like a real story, even on such a low budget. John Huston's direction proves to carry the thin story in The African Queen a long way, and he makes it a memorable visual experience.\nAnd combined with C. S. Forester's own screenplay adapted on the novel he wrote himself, there ends up being plenty of cleverly conceived material for the cast of The African Queen to work with.\nHumphrey Bogart is at some of his most playfully energetic as well and dedicated in The African Queen, and even though his performance isn't the most sophisticated of his career, it still has an amiable charm of life to it in the line delivery he gets right at every second and his iconic smile. Humphrey Bogart carries the story in The African Queen well.\nKatharine Hepburn's charm is tenacious as usual in The African Queen, and she has a marvellous spirit and strength to her ensures that Rose Sayer is a fiercely confident character who convincingly charters the waters with  Charlie Allnut in The African Queen. Katharine Hepburn's dedication to character pays off once again, and she proves to work alongside Humphrey Bogart greatly. Her performance is the true greatest of the film and it's some of her most energetic acting, both emotionally and physically.\nThe chemistry between these two is appealing because there is always a special romantic and dramatic tension between them as they are both aged people taking a journey together which becomes a life changing adventure. Considering that they are considered to be the all time greatest male and female actors, it is no surprise that what happens between them is full of charisma and passion which makes them an amiable duo for The African Queen. The two of them together make a great team and it makes the story of The African Queen very compelling and entertaining to watch, if for nothing else then solely to watch two legendary actors go at it together in an adventure and love story.\nPeter Bull's brief role proves effective as well.\n\nSo The African Queen is a classic example of a jungle adventure film which has a simple story and an extremely dedicated duo of leads.",

Gave myself up for dead back where we started.\n\n\"The greatest adventure a man ever lived... with a woman!\"\n\nThe African Queen is a movie I have wanted to see for a long time. It has the distinction of being one of those classic films that very film fan has to see. On top of that, it stars Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn and is directed by John Huston. So there's really nothing to deter you from wanting to watch it.\n\nWhen WW1 is launched, a missionary living in Africa with her minister brother, must leave with a rugged, riverboat captain; after her village is destroyed by German soldiers and her brother dies. Rose wants Charlie to go down the river, which worries Charlie a great deal because as he says, there's only death down the river. He reluctantly agrees and the river, as well as a German U-Boat create many obstacles for the missionary and alcoholic captain.\n\nThe African Queen wasn't the irrevocable masterpiece a expected, but nonetheless it is still a very good film. I wasn't blown away by anything that the film did, but it was undeniably entertaining and well constructed, written, directed, and acted. The African Queen is a film that needs to be seen by all film buffs. ",

After the brother dies, hard-drinking stubbly sailor Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) comes in and agrees to take Rose down the river. Along the way, they bicker about various things (she's disgusted by his drinking, he finds her too pious), but they grow to respect each other.Bogart and Hepburn pretty much play their usual roles, and the movie also stars a few crocodiles (most of the movie was filmed on location in Africa). The portrayal of the German army certainly seems to be an allusion to the Nazis. But overall, the movie is quite admirable, with Rose's and Charlie's personalities bouncing off of each other. It's like an early buddy comedy, even though it's serious.",

Together they take on the dangerous task of going down the river in order to sink a German ship. At first they are both at odds with each other and struggle to cope with their situation. However, with no one else to turn to, over time, they become close. Their bond is so great that they are willing to die rather than to be separated.

Adapted from the popular 1935 C.S. Forester novel, \"The African Queen\" showcases an early 1900s East African scene in the beginning of the World War I German occupation. Humphrey Bogart earned his gold starring as a man's man of a goofball river boat captain who picks up a stranded English missionary (Katherine Hepburn) after the village she was helping is decimated. Together they embark on a mission down the windy African rivers where they fight off the elements, the enclosing Germans, and their cheeky feelings for one another. All of this culminating with the task of turning the captain's boat, \"The African Queen\" into a large torpedo aimed directly at an enemy warship that is stalking one of the larger lakes in the area. . . For its time, the film is one helluva spectacle and sported some of the early stages of when films were transitioning to color. This obviously enhanced the main point of the film, which was to really show off the wonders of the African jungle. What really stole the show though was ol \"Bogie\", who usually so calm and charming, turned himself into the most likable \"Gilligan\"-esque dweeb ever to navigate such a treacherous scene with a damsel on his arm. Hepburn reciprocates this by portraying the sheltered church girl awakened by adventure and acts accordingly in a just as awkward way. They swoon for each other the way a child goes for their teddy bear. It's innocent and trades off with sweet as well as cheesy with just a hint of danger to keep the audience guessing. . . \nHumphrey \"Bogie\" Bogart's Grade: B (I still prefer him in the more suave roles)\n\nFilm Grade: B",
