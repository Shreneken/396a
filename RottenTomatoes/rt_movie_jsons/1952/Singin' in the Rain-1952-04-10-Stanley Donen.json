            "content": "Singin' in the Rain is a 1950's musical/romance about the transition from silent films to \"talkies\", or a movie with sound. After watching this movie for a second time, I need to break it down. The movie was written by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, who also happens to be the leading actor. The amount of work and dedication the actors and crew went through for the outcome is unbelievable. In one of the scenes, Kelly was sick, however, still sang and acted as if nothing was wrong, despite the other hindrances the scene held. In another scene, Debbie Reynolds' feet were bleeding in her shoes as she went through the intense choreography with no dancing experience before starting the film. Knowing these facts and watching the film again just make all the little things stand out even more. \nThe movie follows silent film star Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) as he and his costar, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), navigate their way into the world of talking pictures in Hollywood during the 1920s. Lamont, however, cannot decipher the difference between Lockwood's acting and his true feelings for her. So, when he takes interest in a simple choir girl, Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds), Lamont was not-so-happy about that. During their transition from silent to sound, they ran into some make or break difficulties which led to the innovation of hidden microphones and voice overs.  \nNot only is this film entertaining, but it also teaches us a lot about the way things used to work in the film industry. Understanding the way films started out and how they look now is important to know and understand so we can continue to expand and grow the way movies are created. The use of color, greenscreen, and even sound are things that we ignore in movies today while back then, it was new and revolutionary. New devices and techniques are constantly being reinvented and modified to tailor to the movie's needs. \nThe acting, costumes, and cinematography are amazing considering the time. In most old movies, people (including myself) cannot stand the acting, but this movie felt oddly modern in some scenes. They told the story in a clean and straightforward way where no one gets lost along the way, which can help to keep the attention on the movie and not distract the viewer from confusing questions. There was not too much side plot as well which is something I like in a movie; not too much fluff.  \nThis is now one of my favorite comfort movies, simply because I could never get tired of it. The soundtrack is catchy, the characters have depth, and the conflict is minimum. I am biased towards musicals, I will admit, but these songs are not just made around the plot, the plot was made around the songs. That is one of the fun quirks I love so much about the movie; you do not need context to listen to the soundtrack. The characters performing the songs (mostly Lockwood and Seldon), made the chemistry and flow of dialog to song smooth and seamless. Also, the fact that Kathy did not just throw herself at Don the first time they met and casually fell for him adds to the realistic aspects of the film. But the one thing that makes this movie a comfort movie for me is that there is only really one main issue, Lina. The characters were not going on several adventures to solve multiple problems, and everything was just clear and concise. \nSingin' in the Rain is honestly a movie that everyone should see; it is not just for musical lovers (trust me, my roommate hates musicals but still really liked this movie). It is not just a romance, or informational, it has so many different components sprinkled throughout it that everyone can find at least something they liked in it. And it has comedy! Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Conner) is the comedic relief of the film and has a wisecracking one-liner for every situation. There is not a specific demographic of people that I would recommend not seeing this movie at least once, but I am sure there are people who would never watch it in their lives. But for me, if I have not seen it at least a hundred times before I turn thirty, I will be extremely upset with myself. \t\nI give this movie a massive twelve umbrellas out of ten! (Over 5/5 if that was possible)",

The movies does have some reminiscent feel of 1930's and 1940's big Hollywood spectacles such as \"42nd Street\". And Gene Kelly, while mostly great, had moments where he just seemed too frenetic and had that ear to ear grin that was too much. Also, there were moments it dragged. These few things just kept it from going up to five stars for me. Don't get me wrong though - these few negatives are far outweighed by what a great and enjoyable film this is.",

Watching the film, the viewer is struck by how unrestrained and spirited it is in the joy of its presentation. It is, in other words, a rapturous celebration of all things cinema, including itself.

The jokes, although simple, are funny, and it mainly has to do with their perfect timing. The cinematography is brilliant. The choreographies even more brilliant. Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds give extraordinary performances, both in acting and dancing, in addition to their fabulous chemistry together. The showcase of silent movies did not at all seem forced. And by the end of the movie, one would realize there had been a love story all along, but it was so natural and lifelike that no clich\u00e9s or utopian La La Land dreams ruined how the feelings were communicated to the viewer. One would really feel the sentiments in the ending, despite the least bit of dramatic effects. This is where the brilliance of the script shows.

Highly recommend for anyone looking for a movie that is classic but not cringe. Excellent.",

Couldn't really point out any flaws though I am questioning if the tap dancing noises were dubbed in?",

            "content": "A peerless musical with a whimsical tone and delightful score.\n\nStanley Donen and Gene Kelly's romantic musical Singin' in the Rain (1952) is always a wonderful watch for me. Stanley Donen's direction for all the dramatic parts is compelling as he effortlessly spoofs the silent age, talkies, Hollywood studios, and the cutthroat world of new actors and actresses. Gene Kelly's direction for all the musical numbers is dazzling with intricate, fast, and playful choreography that fits each scene's tone beautifully. The romantic numbers slow down a bit, the sillier dances are brisk and wild, while the group numbers are huge productions. Singin' in the Rain remains charming, romantic, and funny today. I found it has held up nicely. I haven't seen it since I was a kid, but I like it even more now.\n\nGene Kelly's fast dance steps and nice singing voice are as charming as his character Don Lockwood, who grows on you. He's warm and fun with a versatile skill set. Dick van Dyke got a lot of his Mary Poppins movements from Gene Kelly in Singin' in the Rain for sure. Donald O'Connor is amazing with piano playing, slapstick routines, quick stepping dances, immediately funny comedy bits, and a charismatic presence as Cosmo Brown. He steals many scenes from Gene Kelly with his charming performance in Singin' in the Rain.\n\nDebbie Reynolds is a cute darling with her endearing, persistent, and likable actress named Kathy Seldan. Her singing is powerful and beautiful, her dancing is fast and complex, and her acting is loving and sincere. She's a natural talent, who I could not take my eyes off of her girl next door charm throughout Singin' in the Rain. She steals the entire film. A dreamy silver screen presence as funny as she appears sweet. \n\nOn the other hand, Jean Hagen is funny as the squeaky voiced jerk actress Lina Lamont. Her awful acting and singing are just too fun as she complements everyone else's style. I wonder if Madeleine Kahn got her Minnie Mouse-like voice jokes from Hagen here. Cy Charisse has 2 dances with Gene Kelly and she's gorgeous and captivating in both with her natural ballet dancing style. Rita Moreno gets 2 cameos as Zelda Zanders and she's just hilarious. Millard Mitchell is pretty good as the stuffy producer R.F. Simpson.\n\nAdolph Green and Betty Comden's writing is funny with neat twists on Hollywood filmmaking production troubles, studio producers bowing to big name actresses, and new starlets finding their way in a chaotic industry. The sly jokes are as clever as the quick slapstick. Adrienne Fazan's fast cuts allow you to see all the dance numbers and comedy scenes in equal splendor without getting old for 103 minutes. \n\nHarold Rossen's creative cinematography looks impeccable with touching close-ups and wondrous wide shots during all the dances. You can see every step, jump, and twirl with Rossen's innovative camera choices. The wind and rain machines were put to good use. \nCedric Gibbons and Randall Duell's art direction has these fantastic colorful looks as you're inspired by the windy studio set number with the wind blowing Debbie Reynolds' hair or the dream sequence number with Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse. \n\nEdwin B. Willis and Jacques Mapes' set decoration is dazzling with spacious furnishings to make room for the dances, while keeping everything colorful. Lennie Hayton's score is dreamy and pleasant with playful lyrics and memorable songs. Walter Plunkett's costumes are gorgeous, especially Reynolds' purple dress or Charisse's green and white gowns. William Tuttle's lively make-up dazzles like the musical dance numbers with pink blush and vivid face colors.\n\nIn conclusion, Singin' in the Rain is always a blast to revisit as it quickly goes from slapstick dances to romantic encounters and big musical numbers.",

Made during the genres golden age, it has some of the most iconic moments, greatest songs, most memorable characters, and is just so upbeat and energetic that's its impossible not to be swept along by it. Gene Kelly was a legend of the silver screen, and here his skill and passion are on full display. It still seems strange that his previous effort, An American In Paris, won the coveted Best Picture Oscar, while this film wasn't even nominated. Both are highly regarded but Singin' In The Rain is in a league of its own. If I had to choose a part I didn't like, it would have to be the Broadway Melody sequence. Much like the closing number of An American In Paris, it's beautifully filmed and wonderfully choregraphed, but it goes on for longer than necessary, and the previously breezy pace is slowed considerably. But with that aside, it's hard to recommend this movie enough. It's as rich in emotion as it is in dance moves, and as full of gags as it is full of colour. Its status is well deserved, and its little wonder that in the years since its release, its come to be considered the benchmark for movie musicals. If you haven't seen it yet, you really don't know what you're missing.",

Honestly though, I didn't enjoy this.\n\nIt's certainly worth noting musicals are probably my least favourite genre, but I'm still more than capable of finding entertainment with them - e.g. 'The Greatest Showman', 'The Sound of Music' and others.\n\n'Singin' in the Rain', however, simply didn't connect with me. There's one, maybe two, good songs that I had already heard, while Gene Kelly (Don) is solid fun in the lead role. The premise, minus the music, is actually very interesting, what with the silent film transition era. Given it's a musical, though, they don't delve as deep into that as I wanted.\n\nNone of the songs, aside from the previously alluded to \"Singin' in the Rain\", landed well with me, I kinda found them a chore to sit through to be frank. Elsewhere on the cast, aside from Kelly, I found Debbie Reynolds (Kathy) alright but Donald O'Connor (Cosmo) a little irritating - he tries too hard, for my liking. Jean Hagen (Lina) is likewise a tad annoying, though that's intentional with her to be fair.\n\nI will acknowledge that the film, aesthetically, looks excellent. I wish I liked it more overall, but I just didn't. Do feel free to ignore me!",

The plot wasn't anything spectacular but still offered enough to keep the vehicle rolling, as well as offer plenty of laughs. Gene Kelly however was something spectacular and along with excellent support from Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen and especially Donald O'Connor, is what most drew me in and kept me happily entertained for the duration. The bright and colorful sets also made this picture extremely pleasing aesthetically.\n\nI was immediately drawn to O'Connor's performance and I kept feeling that \"where have I seen him before\" notion tugging at me and it wasn't until he was tapping away during a dance number that it finally hit me. I should backtrack and say my favorite movie growing up was Grumpier Old Men and I loved Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. In 1997 they released the (what is to me) amazing comedy Out to Sea, where the plot involved Matthau tricking Lemmon into a free cruise by signing them up as dance hosts. I had watched that VHS so many times growing up that as soon as the tapping started I instantly recognized O'Connor as one of the two dance hosts the pair befriends. I had always loved him in that little role and thought that casting had just found some random old dude who could still tap dance real well, not realizing until now the humor in casting a guy to play a dance host who had been dancing in some of Hollywood's biggest movies for almost 50 years. (Hand over head motion while making the sound of a jet)\n\nI always have a tough time rating these AFI classics as it is nearly impossible to not take into account the historical significance I am clearly aware of before watching these films. I try to take a balanced approach at how I would rate the film today while still taking into account the significance these have in our current cultural landscape, which possibly leaves my AFI ratings 1/2* to a full * higher on average.",

The film is 103 minutes long and is produced in the United States. Anything that is beautiful is not too much for the movie in the rain, it deserves all praise. The story tells the story of Hollywood in 1927. The actor and supporting actress are screen lovers. The supporting actress is arrogant and talentless. The actor and the heroine meet by chance. The actor found the heroine's talent, and the actor was shooting a song and dance film. During the film screening, the actor debunked the supporting actress's singer and showed the talent of the heroine. The film was in the post-war development stage, and the American society was thriving, without the concerns in the Chaplin film and the subsequent social problems. This film shows the most beautiful aspect of American society and is comparable to Tiffany's breakfast. The main element of the film is singing and dancing, which greatly influenced the later film practitioners in the future. For example, the director of LAA LAND in recent years was also deeply influenced by this film. The protagonist danced and sang in the rain, showing the director's unparalleled creativity. This element was repeatedly borrowed from later films. Even the clockwork orange, it also draws on the bridge where the male lead sings and sings in the rain. In 1952, color films and sound movies were only developed for decades. The film shows the beauty of love, the prosperity and stability of society, and the songs and dances of the film are just right. It is very intoxicating. It is hard to imagine that this movie falls in love with song and dance. The audience of the film, in the past fifty years or so, has never seen the sadness of the birth of a movie beyond the rain. This film is the best song and dance comedy movie in the history of film, and no movie can match it.",

That being said, the music and dancing in this film are a dream, one I wished I never had to wake from, full of whimsey and wonder, and the comedic view of 1920's Hollywood culture on display is refreshing.

And when Lockwood becomes attracted to young studio singer Kathy Selden, Lamont has her fired. But with the introduction of talking pictures, Lockwood finds his career in jeopardy after audiences laugh when they hear Lamont speak in her shrill voice for the first time... until the studio decides to use Selden to dub her voice.\n\nOkay yes, I'm a film student and I hadn't watched \"Singin' in the Rain\" till just recently. Do I get annoyed when people say 'you can' call yourself a filmmaker if you haven't seen ___', yes because it's obviously not true. However, I'm taking a class called World Cinema II. This class presented me with the opportunity to watch \"Singin' in the Rain\" and it was certainly worth the hype. \n\n1952 was a completely different decade. The way film was shot and the way actors performed, it was all so different. Typically, I don't like older films. It's not that I don't appreciate them but they're shot in a completely different way. However, I found a lot of things to really enjoy about this film. One of those things being the fact that I though this film was really clever and intuitive. I was genuinely laughing during multiple parts because of the cleverness of the script. The actors were great and the situations were humorous. I found this film to be entertaining in multiple ways and I certainly found it comical. \n\nThe music in this film is music you've probably heard, even if you don't recognize it. A lot of these songs have become timely classics that are still around in some form today. The thing with musicals is that sometimes, I don't love the music. I'm also not the biggest fan of constant musical numbers that don't move the story. However, this film was filled with some great pieces and I really enjoyed the music. The music was catchy and purposeful and it progressed the story along nicely. The choreography throughout was really well done and I can see where a film like \"La La Land\" got its inspiration from. \n\n\"Singin' in the Rain\" just has a really great story. It's got a lot of great things going for it and for a film made nearly 70 years ago, it still holds up in today's world. I feel like it's packed with so much entertainment, but that entertainment all has deeper meaning. It's a good reflection of the industry during that time and I felt like overall, the screenplay and its execution was done full circle. \n\nIn the end, I really liked this film and it's certainly one I was missing out on. Even if you don't like musicals, I recommend this to those who haven't seen it!",

I found a lot of the jokes fell flat and certain characters were talking in that annoying dialect that some films in the period seem to have. It was however acted well and directed well i found that the camera shots were nice and fluid. But yeah as i sad earlier random dances that dont seem to move the movie forward just dont cut it for me so i'll give it 5/10",

The journey and the transition depicted in here of all the characters; as they aren't palpable to their surrounding anymore, is written explicitly on paper by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. And the rest of it is left to Stanley Done and Gene Kelly; the directors, whose enthusiasm and affection towards the musical acts is crystal clear and they fortunately are able to apply it all in here. Gene Kelly has done a decent work on performance too with Debbie Reynolds and Jena Hagen as a supporting cast but the real game changer is Donald O'Connor who is flat out hilarious in his portrayal. Singin' In The Rain is one of those rare art that just happen to have everything in the right place and if accounted into one big musical opera there lies a genuine soul in it.",

            "content": "Singin' in the Rain (1952) is one of the first ever musical romantic comedies, and although at first it didn't get the attention it deserved, it has since become known as a classic. Many critics consider it to be the greatest movie ever made and it consistently lands on must-see lists, including AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals and Sight & Sound Magazine's 50 greatest films of all time, 2017. Today it stands out among its contemporaries, such as On the Town 1949), Annie Get Your Gun (1950), and An American in Paris (1951) as a representative of the golden age of Hollywood musicals. Its male stars, Gene Kelly and Donold O'Connor, were two of the biggest musical and comedy actors in Hollywood at the time, but Singin' in the Rain is known as both of their best projects. Debbie Reynolds' breakout role was opposite Kelly in Singin' in the Rain as romantic lead Kathy Seldon, launching her into a lifelong film career. \nSet in the late 1920s, the film follows the performing duo Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Cosmo Brown (O'Connor) as they transition from putting on vaudeville shows to silent films and finally to talking films or \"talkies\". The plot line of entertainment innovation mimics the development experienced by the industry at the time of release. Singin' in the Rain was filmed in Technicolor, so every visual element is used to embrace this new technology. Picturesque sets and lighting are emphasized in wide shots on sound stages, contrasting between aesthetic images and the reminder that beauty in the film world is manufactured. The costumes are made in bold colors and flashy materials while remaining era-appropriate, and compliment both the dancing and the characters. \nAs a romantic comedy, Singin' in the Rain checks all the boxes. O'Connor's performance earned a Golden Globe award and his song \"Make 'Em Laugh\" is a textbook example of a hilarious musical number. Kelly's vast experience as the leading man is balanced by Reynolds' freshness and lightheartedness and their portrayal as a couple in love is convincing. However, unlike more recent romantic comedies, Lockwood and Seldon are a team for most of the film. A key component of the plot is his pursuit of this young dancer, but the story continues once they are a couple and they begin to solve problems together. They never experience challenges in their relationship so once Lockwood is secure in his romance with Seldon, his emotional range is exhibited in relation to his annoyingly shrill costar Lena Lemont (Jean Hagen). \nWhile it is not perfect, Singin' in the Rain comes pretty close. In addition to experiencing a blissful 100 minutes, everyone should see this film because it teaches about the roots of an art form that is often taken for granted. Singin in the Rain allows a window into time that will soon disappear from memory. As a great example of both a large-scale musical and a romantic comedy, Singin' in the Rain will always remain relevant.",

            "content": "Singin\u2019 in the Rain, directed by and starring Gene Kelly, is a wonderfully high spirited, feel-good film. The music is cheery, the dance sequences are fun, and story is undeniably sweet. Set in the 1920\u2019s, Singin\u2019 in the Rain takes place during the transition of silent films to sound films, or rather \u201ctalkie\u201d films. It centers on a trio of two actors and a musician--Don Lockwood, Kathy Selden, and Cosmo Brown. In the middle of production, a film starring Lockwood and his costar Lina Lamont, a snobbish woman with a squeaky voice, is transformed into a sound picture. Kathy Selden, Lockwood\u2019s love interest, dubs Lamont\u2019s voice. The story is a little hard to describe as it\u2019s practically a big sequence of related events regarding the four mentioned characters. But the simplicity of its storyline is part of what makes it so special and charming. The comedic elements are very successful in both its situational and visual humor--a result of great acting and directing--in addition to witty dialogue. The musical numbers, although occasionally too long (The Broadway Ballet scene in particular), are filled with immense, colorful sets and impressive choreography. The only arguable flaw I can think of is that around 70% of the musical numbers don\u2019t enhance or help advance the plot. While still enjoyable and harmless at the least, songs like \u201cMake em Laugh\u201d, \u201cMoses\u201d, and as much as I hate to say it, \u201cGood Morning\u201d aren\u2019t extremely necessary and can seem a little pointless. Being the musical lover I am though, the surplus of songs isn\u2019t much of a problem for me. Despite other musical films like Bye Bye Birdie, Mary Poppins, and even the 2016 La La Land having similar styles in execution, none can replicate the charm and heart of Singin\u2019 in the Rain--an unarguably superior film. With its brilliant direction, energetic pacing, and upbeat acting, Singin\u2019 in the Rain still holds up today and without a doubt will continue to remain a timeless classic.",

It reminded me of what La La Land could have been like!\nIt begins in 1927 and the silent film era. Two of the biggest stars are an on-screen partnership Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagan). The trouble is Lamont has an awful voice that until now has been hidden with silent films but is threatened with exposure in the new era of talkies.\nThe studio and Don come up with a solution using Don's new real life love interest Kathy (Debbie Reynolds) to dub Lina's awful voice.\nThe film features several iconic songs in its musical element.
