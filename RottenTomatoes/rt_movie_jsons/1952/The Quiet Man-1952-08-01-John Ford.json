This cast is superb across the board, with Wayne giving one of his best lead performances as Sean Thornton, a man returning to his birth place of Ireland after a tragic incident, hoping to start over.  Its counter to many of his other performances in that he avoids conflict most of the movie, while also getting to show off his comedic & romantic chops.  He's matched perfectly by Maureen O'Hara, one of the great actresses of the Golden Age of Hollywood, and between her looks and feisty personality, its no wonder Thornton falls in love at first site.  Behind the camera, John Ford (who won an unprecedented fourth Best Director Oscar for this) crafts a brilliant romantic comedy about life in Ireland, with a great cast of local actors along with subtle nods to the political conflicts cast the time (the IRA and the Catholic/Protestant conflict are addressed).  It all builds up to one of the greatest and funniest fights ever filmed, resulting a pure movie magic from beginning to end.  Easily one of John Wayne's & John Ford's best films, which by default makes it one of the best films ever made.",

Something else that occurred during filming was in the scene where her hair was blowing in the wind, it kept getting in her eyes and messing her up with her performance. Ford yelled at her for it and she fired back saying, \"What would a bald-headed son of a b**** like you know about hair lashing across his eyeballs?!\" \n\nThis movie is truly magical in multiple ways, but most significantly being the cultural clash between Irish tradition and new American ways and the understanding each of them must learn in order for things to work regarding their separate social norms and customs. \n\nLastly, keep an eye on Barry Fitzgerald in the first pub scene. Cheeky old-timer tosses back two glasses of porter in less than 20 seconds and grabs a third before the scene's end. (Even if they were just stage drinks it was still impressive with the pacing of the scene).",

DeMille's punishingly long blockbuster three-ring soap opera The Greatest Show On Earth did not deserve to win Best Picture.  The Quiet Man  I personally feel should have got the nod Best Picture for 1952 .  It stars John Wayne as Sean Thornton, a former heavyweight boxer who returns to fictional Innisfree, Ireland to reclaim the family farm. There's a sensitive, complicated romance-with independent-minded Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara), sister of local bully Red Danaher (Victor McLaglen, one of Ford's best company players)-but the real attraction here is Ford's masterful maneuvering of tones and his fluid handling of a large cast of colorful characters, qualities which also defined his iconic (and then-underrated) Westerns. Shot partly on location in Ireland and designed in the lushest greens ever squeezed out of Technicolor, The Quiet Man is a movie that isn't about a whole lot, but yet seems to contain so much-from Wayne's easygoing charisma to the notoriously protracted climactic fight to the febrile, film-noir-like flashback to Sean's boxing days. The Quiet Man is on of Wayne best films and his made possible by beautiful spitfire Maureen O'Hara .",

Love isn't portrayed this way anymore. The Duke portrays a man trying to reform, rebuild, and be someone remembered not for explosive acts but quiet strength. Ford reveals a little at a time and pits two men against each other over a woman who is as fiery as they come. It's an amazing build with all of the flavor you can savor, including races, fights, flashbacks, a beautiful score, characters of every color, and much more. While it isn't my favorite Ford film, it celebrates a man after a woman for all the right reasons and willing to fight for her in all the right ways. And it doesn't end with the wedding.

My reaction to The Quiet Man was not very positive, and I stalled out and had to restart the movie more than once. The entire plot is just so bland and uninteresting to me that I'm surprised I persevered to the end. At this point I'm wondering if can muster the willpower to explore any more of Wayne's films because I have not enjoyed his performance yet in my first 2 experiences with him. He is a very stiff actor, and struggles to become a convincing romantic lead here. However, despite all my protestations to this film, I did enjoy moments. There were certain actors who were very good, especially Maureen O'Hara (even if I found her character annoying.) There were also some of the minor characters who gave me a chuckle, which I needed more of while watching this movie. The best part of the film, despite all the frustration I felt up to that point, was the final confrontation which somehow hooked me and I was anxious to see how it would end. One other thing that is worth mentioning was how well-restored the visuals were in the version that I watched. It truly captured the luscious beauty of Ireland. All these lovely things are nice to have in the film, but they just weren't enough to make me like The Quiet Man. I have a sneaking suspicion this is a movie I will quickly forget, and will wonder if I ever actually saw it.",

Everything from butt slapping to grabbing his wife and throwing her into bed is treated as a grand game. At one point a priest even tell O'Hara off for slapping Wayne since she should wait til they're married so he can hit back. Yuck.

I understand that old film actors concentrated more on cultivating a persona than a character for an individual film, but Wayne's persona is neither compelling nor complex.  \nThe film's plot is contrived.  I followed the story with skepticism throughout much of it until it devolved into the most ludicrous fight scene that I could imagine, and then I just rolled my eyes and waited for it to be over.\nWhat strikes me most is the film's misogyny.  Mary's insistence for her own money and all the male characters' resistance bespeaks of a lack of male respect for female identity and self-sufficiency.  The characters and the film itself wreak of over-whelming male superiority, and when Mary agrees to serve them dinner, I couldn't help but conclude that this was a film condemned to its time.\nOverall, maybe there's a film that will make me like John Wayne, but this isn't it.",

            "content": "Before I review this, let me say that my uncle is an obsessive fan of John Wayne. Knowing how big I am on film, especially my growing interest in classics, he always goes up to me and says, \"Hey, you need to see The Quiet Man.\", or \"Hey, you need to see North to Alaska.\", or \"Hey, you need to see Big Jake.\". But the problem is, John Wayne, while he's a fine actor, I'm not too fond of the films he's in, especially True Grit. The only Wayne films that I've seen that are worth 100% are The Searchers, Rio Bravo, and The Longest Day. But, I have interest in watching these kinds of films, so when I discovered a copy of The Quiet Man in my local library, I just couldn't resist. But unfortunately, despite the fact that it's one of Wayne's most acclaimed films, #2 in most critic's list, I just wasn't a huge fan of it, even if it is directed by Wayne buddy John Ford.\r\n\r\nJohn Wayne plays Sean Thornton, an American boxer who returns to his Irish roots to escape his troubled past. Immediately, he falls for the lovely Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), but soon faces conflicts with her grumpy brother (Victor McLaglen) over the relationship and his decision to purchase his own land that he was trying to buy for himself. When Thornton and the woman marry, Red Will, the brother, goes as far as stealing her fortune and intimidate them both. Sean must reface his troubled past in order to end his troubles.\r\n\r\nJohn Ford is an excellent director, don't get me wrong. He's made loads of stellar films in his career, including the classic film (with Wayne) The Searchers, How Green Was My Valley, and The Grapes of Wrath. But The Quiet Man isn't my favorite.\r\n\r\nHere are some things I liked about the film. First, the cinematography is fantastic. Well, it helped that the film was actually shot on location in Ireland itself, which, in reality, which was where director John Ford grew up. Had in been filmed in some Hollywood backlot, I would have given it a lower score. And I'm not kidding. \r\n\r\nI was also highly impressed with the score by Victor Young. It's tense, it's exciting, and it's moving. It managed to get me going when I was struggling with other issues with the film, which I'll get to in a minute.\r\n\r\nYou may think I have some problem with John Wayne, but no, he's an excellent actor, I'm just not the biggest fan. Here, Wayne delivers, especially in scenes where he discusses his character's troubled past. The scene where we witness a key moment in his past might be my favorite scene, with the stunning camera shots and the actor's facial expressions in the outcome of a certain boxing incident. Maureen O'Hara also stuns as the love interest. I was impressed with the two's chemistry, which is probably why they did so many films together. My favorite moment here is when he grabs her and does a big kiss on her, which was later imitated in the Steven Spielberg classic ET. I was also impressed by their physical emotions, such as a scene where Wayne comforts O'Hara from a storm in a graveyard. I also liked Victor McLaglen as the town bully. He is a pretty good intimidator, and has some excellent scenes with Wayne.\r\n\r\nNow here's when I start criticizing the film. My uncle promised me that this film was very funny, but he lied. To begin, this is not a comedy, this is a drama. A heavy, serious, romantic, drama. Yeah, there was some form of comedy coming from the supporting actors, but the comedy felt extremely forced and I couldn't find anything to laugh about, especially when a preacher falls into a pond while attempting to catch a fish. While that would be funny if the person was Charlie Chaplin, it really failed miserably here. If you want to watch John Wayne in a comedy, this isn't it. McLintock is just another John Wayne film away.\r\n\r\nAlso, why were there moments of song in this? This is not a musical. I thought my uncle hated musicals (well, his one exception was Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, so he claims). The singing in the Irish pub annoyed me and kind of ruined the flow of the picture. Even a drunken Wayne attempting to sing didn't help either.\r\n\r\nBut the biggest problem I had with The Quiet Man was the film's climax. On the DVD cover, the film promised \"the longest brawl ever filmed.\" But instead, I was treated to a brawl, but instead of physical contact, we witness locals' bets on the outcome and a heavy crowd blocking the way, and like I mentioned earlier, forced comedy that doesn't help the dramatic flow of the film. When we actually do see the actual brawl, one punch, and it's over. Now that's what I call false advertising. Definitely one of the most disappointing, anticlimactic fight scene I've ever witnessed. You know the climax is a big disappointment when the film's most exciting scene is a small horserace in the middle of the film.\r\n\r\nSo in the end, The Quiet Man has an excellent John Wayne performance, and the score and cinematography were outstanding, the film suffers from some dry, unfunny comedy, some painfully annoying pub songs, and the most disappointing climax a man could ever witness. It had it's moments, but I wasn't completely wowed by the experience",

Primarily known for his westerns, I love how this one is more atypical. It also helps that I've got a fair amount of Irish ancestry in me, thus can better appreciate this being a wonderful love letter to The Emerald Isle.\n\nThe story is that of Irish American boxer Sean Thornton who returns to the small Irish village of his birth. Distraught after having accidentally killed a man in the ring, all he wants is to live out the rest of his life peacefully and quietly on his family's land, which is no easy task, as he soon incurs the ire of the squire- a local brute who was wanting the land for himself. \n\nNot only that, but Sean falls in love with the squire's sister, a feverishly traditional and fiery woman who insists that her and Sean's courtship be by the books, which includes receiving a dowry...that her brother refuses to pay. The couple get married, but until that dowry is received, the marriage absolutely won't be consummated.\n\nWhat follows is a gloriously jolly romp that shows Sean trying to prove he's a real man without always having to resort to violence, which he is of course reluctant to do given his past.\n\nYes, the movie does perpetuate a few stereotypes about Irish men loving to drink and fight, but it could be far worse. The film has a fun set up, great supporting characters, and, since it was shot on location, it features Ireland in all of its glory with some truly marvelous cinematography.  The music is also quite nice as well, and it's not surprising that this has become THE movie to watch every St. Patrick's Day as a result.\n\nWayne gives a fine performance, and it is nice seeing him in a role like this where he actual does have to try to act and show off his dramatic chops. He's successful too. Maureen O'Hara basically cemented her career here as Mary Kate the love interest, and for better or worse, she's the embodiment of a gorgeous prototypical Irish lass.  Victor McLaglen is great as her bullying brother, and the great aforementioned supporting characters are superbly played by Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald, and Mildred Natwick among others.\n\nDefinitely give this one a watch. It's got drama, romance, comedy, action, and really leaves you feeling great inside.",

The whole cast seems to be engaged in a labor of love, and their happiness at filming the movie comes through in their performances. The story itself is entertaining and heart-warming, although the end is never in doubt. This is probably John Wayne's most genuine performance, it being so obvious he feels comfortable inhabiting the skin of Sean Thornton, his character.

The fact that it was an older film didn't bother me at all, as some of my favorite films are older. But in the end, I ended up liking this film quite a lot. Wayne does a fine job in his role, the rest of the Irish townsfolk are rather fun, and Wayne's rival is a believable guy who isn't really a jerk but just doesn't trust the new guy (Wayne) in town yet. The film has several funny moments which would stand out in today's realm of what is usually considered funny, being as though there is no crude humor. Nope, none. It's just all smart, ironic, and neat. The fact that the whole film was shot in Ireland makes it even better. The only two things which really bugged me at all were; the leading lady, Maureen O'Hara's, acting. I never really cared for her character at all, which when she is one of the two main, it's really a bother, and the occasional random songs which the townsfolk would sing. It reminded me of musicals, and I frigging HATE musicals. Overall though, The Quiet Man really is a great film.",

What I really liked about the issues raised in this film is that the film answers how the main character deals with it and also leaves you wondering about the issues yourself. And while the film does raise some intellectual questions, it is also very entertaining to watch. The chemistry between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara is very evident and very charming. I also really loved the plot of the film. It's very easy to follow and also at the same time doesn't feel over simplified. The Quiet Man is one of those rare experiences that absolutely engrosses you with beautiful scenery, fabulous acting, a wonderful story and a sweet romance that builds to a realistic level as the film goes on. If you love John Wayne films, or even if you're not a fan of John Wayne, this film is a must see. It's a cinematic experience I won't soon be forgetting. \r\n\r\n9.8/10",

Upon his arrival, he meets a colorful array of characters, including the fiery Kate Danaher (played exquisitely by Hollywood's Irish lass herself, Maureen O'Hara) and the somewhat bibulous Irishman Michaleen Oge Flynn (the downright precious Barry Fitzgerald). Part slapstick comedy, part character study, part romance, what Ford delivers in The Quiet Man through the great performances from Wayne, O'Hara, and Fitzgerald, and some stunning cinematography, is a shamelessly nostalgic, good-humored, and somewhat misty-eyed memory of an ideal Irish community.",

The Quiet man is a quaint little movie that combines a sweepingly romantic story, clever humor, and beautiful cinematography to a perfect concoction of a great John Ford movie. What makes it extra special, is the perfect chemistry between its two leads and suprise! John Wayne doesn't play a G.I. or a cowboy! He really shows his merit as an actor, giving a subtle and sensitive yet still brooding with masculinity take on one of his most perplexing characters. The film is a must-see for all good catholics and Irishmen alike.\r\n\r\nThe studio originally wanted to shoot the film outside its actual location, but thank god John Ford went to Ireland to shoot this movie! It has to be one of the most beautiful films ever made. A feast for your eyes, the sparkly and rolling green hills of Ireland are expertly captured and the early use of technicolor is flawless. If you need a movie that you can turn off the sound and just appreciate the beauty of the film, I would say that Lawrence of Arabia and this film would both be on that list. \r\n\r\nIt is when you listen to it though, that the movie really shines. The film is cleverly humorous with many aspects of Irish culture weaved into its story. The film follows Sean Thornton, a retired prizefighter who goes to his homeland after a fatal knockout leaves his career in shambles. he quickly falls in love with a young woman but their love is soon troubled as her brother refuses to give up the dowry and their wedding is deemed unofficial to Irish customs. The dowry will not be given up without a fight, so Sean must soon come out of his newly pacifist shell and face his enemy through the passion of his love.\r\n\r\nJohn Wayne never really struck me as an actor, but his performance in this movie makes up for even his biggest flops (Yes, even The Green Berets). It was great seeing him play the non-aggressor but as the film builds up to the famous \"Queensbury rules\" fight, it was still nice to see classic Duke in action. Maureen O'Hara is also a strong performer, she reminds me a lot of my sister in this film so I felt a bit more personally connected to her character. What usually makes rom-coms fail is a lack of chemistry, thankffully this film has perfect chemistry between the couple, which makes for a sweepingly romantic and richly fufilling film.\r\n\r\nI am a good Catholic boy, so I automatically loved the Irish culture and the romance was one of my favorite save maybe Casablanca. If you love Ireland, romance, or just want to see the Duke in a non-typecasted role, The Quiet Man is a perfect movie.",

However his performance in this was brilliant as it showed what a good actor he is , with some top notch performances by Maureen O Hara who shows how hard life was like for women in the time period and plays the love intrest of the main character. While Victor McLagen who puts in a splendid performance as he plays the main Villain of the movie which shows that the main crew was excellent and the three of them would star in more movies together. \r\n\r\nI think John Ford did a good job directing the movie even tho he is associated with directing war films and western alongside John Wayne but can show that he can direct other types of geners by directing this movie as he keeps the viewer gripped in to watch the movie.   \r\n\r\noverall The quiet Man is a excellent Film as it shows what a Man will do to be with the woman he loves and following the trials and customs of his homeland Ireland",

            "content": "A slice of the old country, the little people and the blarney is very much enjoyed in The Quiet Man. It's essentially a western set in Western Ireland but has all the beautiful detail one expects in Ford films. \r\n\r\nThe plot follows that of the classic western meets taming of the shrew. \r\n\r\nStranger comes to town. \r\nFalls for the sister of the town's most powerful man who is also a tough fighting man. \r\nConflict arises between stranger and local tough guy. \r\nA further conflict occurs between feisty femme and the stranger. \r\nThe inevitable showdown happens.\r\nAnd the good guy wins the fight and the woman's heart. \r\n\r\nThe plot may sound basic, but the beauty of this film is in great locations, fine performances and a cracking script with plenty of the Irish craic. It's the humour and undeniable charm that really carries the movie along and is only interrupted by several beautiful pools of romance in the middle of the knockabout comedy/drama.  \r\n\r\nDirector Ford may only have had one eye but probably saw much more than those with two eyes and 20-20 vision. It's his eye for the detail that make this movie especially memorable. Throughout the movie you feel like you are in the west of Ireland, almost one of the locals of Innisfree as you go inside the pub, the humble cottage, the church, the farmhouses and join the locals in the rolling greenery of the Irish countryside. \r\n\r\nThe first confrontation between Sean Thornton (played excellently by John Wayne) and Red Will Danaher(equally good stuff from Victor McLaglan) has almost everything. \r\n\r\nThe romance of the wee Irish pub, the friendliness of the locals once Sean Thornton's identity has been revealed and the music starts - Wild Colonial Boy sung by none other than country and western singer Ken Curtis - Ford's real life son in law as the accordion playing Dermot Fahy. It hardly gets more Irish than this. \r\n\r\nEnter Red Will looking for fight. The brilliant dialogue follows \"I said good morning\" Sean declares. \"Aye but it was good night you had in your mind\" Red Will accuses Sean of making an ungentlemanly pass at his sister Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara). The tension mounts. \r\n\r\nFord's real life brother Francis Ford plays an old man in the pub and is central to this early scene - acting almost like a referee in between the two hulks of Sean and Red Will. In the end religious intervention in the form of the unlikely but convincing Ward Bond's Fr Lonnigan saves a full-blown fistfight. But it is only delaying the inevitable. The tone for the whole movie is set.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is superb performances and Ford has his usual team in harness here with Wayne and McLaglan leading the way. Maureen O'Hara who plays Mary Kate Danaher is at her radiant feisty best and probably never looked more beautiful in a movie. Then there is Barry Fitzgerald whose character is part leprechaun, part barfly and as the movie progresses he pops up as a jack of all trades - taxi service, matchmaker, bookmaker and even furniture removal man. He steals many scenes with his great acting and his presence certainly adds all the charm you would expect to find in leprechauns. \r\n\r\nIt's certainly one of Ford's finest and has an epic fight at the end, which is not brutal, but merely cartoon violence that Tarantino would be proud of. \r\n\r\nSo with wild Irish humour, accordion and loud piano music, jaunty Irish pub songs, meaty confrontations, flames of red haired Irish folk and a big fight, you might ask why this film is called The Quiet Man. Well here's the real conflict and the great irony of the title. Sean Thornton is a retired boxer and has returned to his hometown from Pittsburgh to enjoy \"the quiet life\". He gets anything but tranquillity and has to emerge from his conscience, morals and indeed motives to fight for the right to have a quiet life and a beautiful wife - who is a shrew needing tamed as she prods her man to fight for her pride. \r\n\r\nThe Quiet Man is a classic and one of Ford's standouts among his amazing canon of great work. He shows us a post revolution Ireland at it's finest. A movie that never tires through repeat viewings, this is must for the DVD collection and whenever you're feeling down it is a perfect pick me up, just insert disc, press play and let the great John Ford take you to the Emerald Isle and all it's wonder.",

Sean doesn't care for her money. He loves her and that's that. \n\nThe brother on the other doesn't like Sean and since due to some Irish custom, won't let Sean court his sister Mary Kate. Luckily, a few of the locals trick the brother into letting him think that the widow tillane wants to marry him unless Mary Kate is out of the house. But it's on the wedding day where Red discovers he's been had and decides to keep Mary Kate's dowry from her.\n\nSean is stuck with being called a coward by Mary Kate if he doesn't return her dowry back to her from her brother. And then finally, the ending which is probably one of the most hilarious fights ever put to film when Sean and Red box eachother pretty much all over Innisfree, the small town.\n\nI can see why my late grandma Marjorie called this film her favorite. It's sweet and endearing. My favorite part would have to be when Sean enters the home he grew up to only find that somebody has tidied up the place. It was sweet Mary Kate. She hides in the back room. It's windy. Something startle's her as she makes her way to the front door, but It's Sean who stops her. The door wide up, the wind blowing in as Sean plants a kiss on Mary Kate. \n\nOne of the best kissing scenes ever. ;)",

In none of their other films do I get a sense of true being and reality of characters. Some of that can be accredited to the writing, but this film feels real. Watch it and you'll understand what I mean. You can tell that everyone from the director down to the last grip did their jobs correctly. When I'm missing a place that I love very much and my memories aren't as fresh as they used to be, I pop this DVD in and relive a time beyond time. It was shot so beautifully that there are times it has a dreamlike quality. I can almost see Sean Thornton and Mary Kate Danaher walking together through the fields. I can almost smell the Heather. THIS is a film that will give the future something to think about.",
