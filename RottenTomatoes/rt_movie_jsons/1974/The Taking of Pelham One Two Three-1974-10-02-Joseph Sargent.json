On the other end of the line, crusty veteran transit policeman Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau) has his hands full dealing with the mayor's office and his hotheaded fellow cops, while also trying to deliver the ransom before the deadline expires.",

I thought the story was interesting and the characters, the bad guys so to speak, were quite sinister and mysterious. I was left guessing quite a lot. I thought the ending was quite good too - subtle but good. I also liked it as Walter Matthau was in it and I haven't seen him in many films. There were some racist comments made but I suppose its a film of its time maybe? (it dates from 1974). I wouldn't say it was necessarily one of the most amazing films I've ever seen but its a pretty solid film never the less and so I would recommend it, yes.",

Walter Matthau is excellent, as are most of the supporting cast, as the crusty transit cop negotiator.

It captures the times, the fear and the moxie of New Yorkers, and the grit, grime, and gallows humor that you would expect.\n\nIt has humanism without sacrificing suspense. It has clich\u00e9d but delightfully accessible characters. The very fact there is no high- falutinisms, no artsy-smartsy, brings the movie to a level of excellence that is very hard to find. It is pure escapist entertainment, what movie-tickets were designed to deliver.\n\nSince I can find nothing of great consequence to complain about in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (the cynicism gets a little too thick from time to time), I simply think you should, if at all possible, grab a copy or a download of this wonderful suspenser, and make it an evening.",

There's got to be a good reasoning behind it. \n\nThis movie has a surprisingly good sense of humor. Like when those Japanese men ended up talking really good English at the end of the tour. Things started getting really interesting once they put those tubing on the train. The look the inspector gives at the end, priceless. \n\nThe movie doesn't take itself too seriously and takes a somewhat lighthearted approach at something very serious.

I love the pace of this film, because it does an excellent job of slowly raising the stakes so I'm always on the edge of my seat waiting to see what will come next.  I also love the way they melded 2 different genres that I love.  There is the heist film that has us meeting the crooks and figuring out how they will execute their plan, and simultaneously we are given a mystery film where we get to see how the police are going to solve this problem.  The movie has a superb cast, loaded with names and faces that you'll recognize.  Most prominent of these actors are Robert Shaw as the leader of the gang, and Walter Matthau as the man in charge of the transit cops.  They have very different styles, but I love watching them talk to one another because they're always trying to get into the other person's head.  The movie has some humor sprinkled throughout it, and I loved that aspect as well.  Some of the characters who are working for the subway have hilarious personalities, and I was intrigued when those humorous characters suddenly became serious as the tension escalated.  The ending isn't some dramatic or unpredictable twist like you might expect, but that didn't matter to me because I was enjoying the entire ride.  However I could see others being let down because the film seems to be setting up for some brilliant surprise by the crooks, but it's simply not all that shocking.  To be honest, the only criticism I have of this film is the quality of the version I was able to watch.  It had some serious sound issues, including some very poor ADR lines.  I think if I can watch it again in a higher quality this might be a film I love for a long time.",

Walter Matthau plays a head honcho at the transit authority who negotiates with the hijackers over radio and is a commanding screen presence. Matthau is greatly aided by a terrific supporting cast of NYC character actor types that includes Jerry Stiller, Kenneth McMillan, Joe Seneca, Bill Cobbs and Tony Roberts. The bad guys in the cast include Robert Shaw, Martin Balsam and Hector Elizondo. Directed by Joseph Sargent, who was for the most part a journeyman director who did make a few cool movies like \"White Lightweight\" and \"The Man,\" but who for the most part did a lot of TV work and a lot of  unmemorable of films, which is surprising considering he made this one that stands out as a terrifically smart and suspenseful classic. And I don't necessarily think it's a case of Sargent being elevated by the cast and script. His direction is stylish and wonderfully tight. Top all this off with a classic score by David Shire, which incidentally was chosen as one of the top 10 film scores of all time by NPR.",

He doesn't make you laugh, but instead you just think \"Robert Shaw is awesome.\" There's cynical and sarcastic humor in just about every scene.

            "content": "A critically acclaimed thriller classic, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three sounded like a very interesting film.\n\nLike many of the thrillers of the age, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is a slow moving thriller. With its hostages trapped in a train underground, they have nowhere to go and all the importance comes from the negotiations between Lt. Zachary \"Z\" Garber and Bernard Ryder. But the negotiations aren't as intense as they could be, and the simple fact that almost nothing goes on inside the titular train Pelham One Two Three leaves it feeling a little dull. Clearly, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is a dated film and the battle of age is a hard thing for it to win. I guess it doesn't necessarily win the battle, but it does survive it. But then again, a lot of viewers may be thrown off by its length and the fact that it is all very slow.\nThe intensity in the film could have been a lot better if director Joseph Sargent capitalised on its musical score a lot more. As Donald A. Guarisco writes, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three \"one of the best and most inventive thriller scores of the 1970s\", but you would hardly recognise that today because the music is used too little for it to be of any serious benefit. While the music is terrifically composed and iconic of the time that the film was produced in, it really is not used enough to lay much of a serious effect down. A lot of the scenes in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three seem extensively long and dull without much atmosphere or tension whatsoever, and it is those scenes which are particularly boring and negative in how they affect the film as a whole. Viewers have to be prepared for a long and slowly burning thriller with The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, and though fans of classical films may rejoice at the sight of such an influential and original film, a lot of modern viewers may deem it to be too slow to satisfy them. But overall, it is easily to see what makes it an enjoyable film.\nThe Taking of Pelham One Two Three is one of the earliest examples of a thriller which maintains interest by displaying the terrorists, the hostages, and the negotiators all evenly over the course of its story. Although it doesn't have as much depth in focusing on the passengers as it could, it does manage to focus on the terrorists and police officers well, as well as capturing the large scale of how the events affect the city. The Taking of Pelham One Two Three makes a good effort to truly and honestly captured the spectacle of its events and the exterior effect of them, and it does that well. \nAnd admittedly, it is easy to see how viewers would feel the thrills in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three because it has such a gritty edge with its subject matter and the fact that it is not afraid to explore such rough edged material. It is violent without being excessive, and it finds just the right line.\nThe Taking of Pelham One Two Three is a fine visual spectacle because being shot on location ensures that it is thoroughly convincing as a thriller. Capitalising on the scenery of the subway and such, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three feels genuine and ensures that the effect of the film is greater. While it isn't perfect, it is captured all with a lot of fine cinematography and edited at a great pace to ensure that it moves along nicely.\nAnd on top of it all, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three stays very true to its source material by maintaining the nature of its story as well as a lot of intelligent dialogue which ends up ensureing that the cast have a lot of material to work with.\nWalter Matthau gives a terrific lead performance. Putting a lean strength into his line delivery which is full of emotional tension, Walter Matthau capitalises on the most key element to his character as a negotiator in a complicated hostage situation. By maintaining the appropriate heroic sophistication the entire time, Walter Matthau gives the character Lt. Zachary \"Z\" Garber the ideal persona and maintains it the entire time throughout the film without slipping up for a second. Walter Matthau's lead performance in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is an immensely strong one and it increases his credibility as an actor through simple means which come to him without being challenging at all as clearly demonstrated by his charisma.\nRobert Shaw also makes a fine cast member in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. Tackling the role of the main antagonist, Robert Shaw is fearless to step into the role of Bernard Ryder because he does it without problem. He incorporates a lot of natural grit into his line delivery and so he creates a realistic figure for the story, and the unflinching sense of relentless killer instincts in him is what makes him such a villain. You can tell that Robert Shaw has no problem in the role because he gives a dramatic edge to the film which adds to its streak of success in touching upon edgy material, and he is consistently strong with his dark natured line delivery and intense stare. His chemistry with Walter Matthau is also great even though it is challenging to have chemistry with another actor when interacting over a microphone, but the two talented actors have no problems with doing it in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three.\nThe performances of Martin Balsam and Jerry Stiller are also terrific.\n\nSo although The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is a very dated thriller film, it is visually stylish, original and well acted enough to transcend most of the issues that come with being a slow thriller that has existed for 40 years.",

It's just a regular day in the New York City Transit Authority.\r\n\r\nWalter Matthau headlines a superb cast in this adrenaline charged, roller coaster ride. He was excellent as the cop  thrust into the position of negotiating with a former mercenary who along with his cohorts has hijacked a New York City subway train.  Robert Shaw is equally good  as the villainous mastermind behind the subway train takeover. But, the heart of the film is the interplay between Matthau and Shaw as the ruthless killer demands his money while Matthau attempts to achieve the safe release of the hostages.\r\n\r\nEach of the heavies in this picture are identified by colors Mr. Green, Grey, Blue and Brown; a plot point used by director Quentin Tarantino in Reservoir Dogs. Martin Balsam is terrific as one of the hijackers with a head cold, which ultimately leads to his undoing. Hector Elizondo, as an unhinged thug who was thrown out of the Mafia who is eager to execute anyone who crosses him, and Earl Hindman who later played Mr. Wilson on Home Improvement, were good in early roles in their careers. A solid crew of character actors round out this picture, most notably Jerry Stiller as a transit cop who ably matched wisecracks with Matthau.\r\n\r\nThe film generates tension and suspense without resorting to blood and gore levels of violence. There is some shooting with automatic weapons and sidearms but not much of that. There is no blood, and no homage to the ultimate action film cliche: the final shoot out in an abondoned warehouse, albeit there is one in a subway tunnel; this is a subway story after all.  The tension cleverly shifts from whether the hijackers will receive their ransom on time to how they will escape from a subway tunnel beneath Manhattan.\r\n\r\nThis are also some funny lines, but none of the humor is jammed into the script just to get a laugh, but rather  comes across as what people under such stress might say.",

Maybe a little dated now, but it's still one heck of a thriller.

With a brilliant, tense performance by Robert Shaw, this is a stunning, near flawless film that is among the finest action thrillers of the 1970's. This is a stunning work of cinema that is executed to near perfection and the key to the success of the film is in the taut and thrilling, well written script that delivers a memorable and very entertaining plot that still holds up to this day. So many great classic cinematic works are set in New York, and this is one of the few that has been overlooked and very underrated. If you love the classic, unfiltered action films of old that don't use nifty special effects, but the power of a terrific script, wonderful acting to create its tense situations, then give this one a viewing. Brilliantly executed and this is a stellar work of a heist film that has enough thrills to rival any action pictures that came after it. The remake was good, but it fell short of course, and with that being said, this film's biggest strength is the tour De force demented performance of Shaw who plays the leader of criminals who highjack the train Pelham one, two, three. His role alone is for me anyways one of the most memorable roles in any film of this period and it is among his greatest performances. Sit back, buckle in and be prepared because Pelham one, two, three is a ride that you won't soon forget.",

In other words, if all of you simultaneously were to rush me, not a single one of you would get any closer than you are right now. I do hope I've made myself understood.\u00a0\n\n\"No other hijack was ever like this.\"\n\nThe Taking of Pelham One Two Three is a great classic thriller. It's exciting, suspenseful, funny, and brilliant. I saw the remake from Tony Scott awhile ago and I moderately liked it. I was not expecting the original to be this good. It's tense, but it has a sense of humor throughout. It's also incredibly intelligent, which is a lot more than you can say about the average crime thriller. The pacing is perfect. It isn't hyperkinetic, but it also keeps a foot on the gas the whole time. There's just nothing I can say about the film. The acting is good; I especially liked Robert Shaw as Mr. Blue. The whole runtime is filled with entertainment and fun; and there's always a sense of danger throughout.\u00a0\n\nThe Taking of Pelham One Two Three describes the action of the film. Four hijackers take over a subway train in New York. They have 18 hostages and order the city to get them $1 Million in an hour or they will start shooting hostages. While their in the tunnels, a police officer works to try to get them the money in time. He negotiates with them, while keeping track on the route of the money. What tells me this is an incredible movie, is that I already knew the plot beforehand; yet I was engrossed by it again. It all leads to a very smart and well done ending that completely destroyed the remakes.\n\nThis is also an influential film. The most obvious point from the movie is the color coded names. We all know the other famous film that did the same thing. It also set a new standard for the hijacked vehicle type of movies. This is probably the best one I have ever seen. It should be the blueprint when looking at how to make a good hijack movie.\u00a0\n\nI think in the end, fun is the word that best describes the experience of watching Pelham One Two Three. You can't watch it and not be completely sucked into everything that is going on. There's not a whole lot in the sense of action. There's no big explosions. There's shooting, but its sparse. Yet the movie reaches an area of excitement that action films that endlessly blow stuff up, can't.\u00a0",

I suspect Lumet got the idea for shooting his Washington Post interiors in \"All The President's Men\" from the gritty way the Transit Authority office is shot here, with those hot florescent lights that contrast so wonderfully with the dark subway scenes.What else to say?

It's a testament to \"Pelham\" that it has been remade twice--once as a made-for-TV movie, and the other as a big-budget action picture. However, the decision to produce these remakes hasn't yielded satisfying results. Peter Stone earned an Oscar nomination in 1974 for his screenplay, which is adapted from John Godey's 1973 novel. You can count among its biggest admirers Quentin Tarantino, who borrowed the color-coded nicknames of the villains in the film for his band of thieves in \"Reservoir Dogs.\"\n\nFour armed men hijack a New York City subway train and demand $1 million dollars which must be delivered in 1 hour for the release of the passengers held hostage. Lt. Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau) of the New York City Transit Police must contend with City Hall, the demands of the hijackers, and the ticking clock in his efforts to save the passengers and bring the hijackers to justice. The initial hijacking plan doesn't seem to make any sense because their options are so limited. At one point Lt. Garber jokingly says: \"They're gonna get away by asking every man, woman and child in New York City to close their eyes and count to a hundred.\" But there is a clever getaway plan coordinated by Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw), who plays a former mercenary soldier. His team members include two professional criminals and a fired motorman (Martin Balsam) with a grudge.\n\nThe main strength of the film is the acting. Shaw, Balsam, and Elizondo each get to play to their own specific skill set. Shaw is cool, devious, and calculating. Balsam is a working class, somewhat decent, criminal. On the other side of things, Matthau is at his sardonic best as Garber. Little time is spent on the back story, subplots, or exploration of motives. It's about a subway train, the bad guys, the good guys, hostages, and money. That's it. comparing the original to the 2009 Tony Scott-directed remake, where substantial screen time is devoted to such concerns, the movie falls well short. Do yourself a favor: instead of watching the remake, seek out the original. It's an urban thriller with charisma and a vitality all of its own.",

            "content": "(4 Stars) The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is very much a film of its time. It takes place in the 1970's with all of its politically incorrect glory. It also shows you how much thrillers have changed throughout the years: there are no cell phones, very little surveillance cameras, and digital technology (if any) is in its early form. Even the villains in thrillers of the 1970's are more subdued; just compare Robert Shaw's calm and cool performance with John Travolta's frantic and hilariously vulgar in the 2009 remake. It was a simpler time and that meant simpler thrillers, like Marathon Man and The French Connection. So which film gets the edge? The original or the remake? I can't really favor one over the other since it feels like apples and oranges. They share the same basic story, but vary in acting, direction, style, characters, and atmosphere. Both films have good chemistry between the protagonist and antagonist despite being mostly on a radio. Both are also entertaining from start to finish. There are many reasons to see The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, like the Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw's performances, but my main recommendation is because it's a time capsule of 1970's thrillers.",

Armed with submachine guns, the men hijack a subway car and demand a million-dollar ransom for the passengers in hostage.

Walter Matthau (Lt. Garber)\n2.) Robert Shaw (Blue)\n3.) Martin Balsam (Green)\n4.) Hector Elizondo (Grey)\n5.) Jerry Stiller (Lt. Rico Patrone)\n\nWhen I first watched this I found 'The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three' as a great, thrilling underground subway action classic of the time. I believe that the '70s saw the rise of hijackings in transportation that coincides this movie (and the John Godey novel that it was based on) being made. There is a moving drama in which the armed men take over the train as the subway control room listens, all the way until the great action happens when Walter Matthau comes to fight them. He's done an outstanding acting performance here while playing the hero who saves the day. Films from the '70s are now fascinating me, and I was glad to have found this exciting film from Pelham 123.",

The focus of the story is on the authorities as they try to stop the villains and free the hostages.  Moreover, you will spend the majority of the film wondering how the bad guys can possibly get away.  This film isn't about great acting, though Walter Matthau did a great job of extending the plot while subsequently serving as the comic relief.  Instead of relying on its actors, Pelham's story-telling creates a driving intensity that carries the film from curious start to fantastic finish.  In fact, the majority of my rating for this film was determined in the final 10 seconds as the story was perfectly resolved.  There is some action, particularly in the epic runaway train scene, but the film is primarily a thriller filled with intrigue.  Although it is difficult to distinguish between the bad guys with their matching mustaches, Robert Shaw (from Jaws) is the most memorable villain.  His unpredictability, particularly in his final scene, and mysterious back story kept me wish that he had his own spin-off film.  From start to finish, Pelham is entertaining with unpredictable twists.  Its 2009 remake did not receive positive reviews but do not let that hinder you from giving the original masterpiece a try.",

            "content": "\"The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three\" is a 1974 action thriller starring Walter Mathau and Robert Shaw. The movie was directed by Joseph Sargent and it tells the story of a man (Shaw) who, with some other gunmen, hijack a subway train in New York City. The man is soon pitted against a railway police official (Mathau) who, with the help of others, tries to stop him.  Now let me start off by saying that I actually saw the 2009 Tony Scott remake before I saw the 1974 original. Is the original better than the 2009 remake? In short - yeah, pretty much. In comparing the two movies, it seemed as though, while the 2009 remake felt more up-to-date, it's more modern approach to elements presented in the original often came off as too over-the-top. I felt that in presenting these certain elements, the 1974 version came off more subtle and pulled it off with a lot more finesse. The 1974 movie has two really impressive actors in the leading roles - Mathau and Shaw. Both of which are really, very entertaining in \"Pelham\", but I'd have to say that Shaw's performance shines the most in this movie. His demeanor throughout the entire movie is really hilarious. He just comes off as this soulless jerk - a soulless jerk with some pretty hilarious one-liners. That brings me to the script which, as I said, contains some pretty great one-liners not only from Shaw, but from Mathau and others. It's nothing really impressive or Oscar-worthy, but it does have a few gems in it here and there. While I, a Generation-Z kid, found this movie to be very easy to watch, it did at times have a few moments of cheese. That being said, I'm not going to knock the movie for being a little long in the tooth - but it does show sometimes. The movie was really entertaining and I can see why it was well received when it came out. I can also see the immense amount of expectations the 2009 movie had to live up to. Overall, I found \"The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three\" to be a fairly enjoyable crime thriller.",

The original has more believable villains (Travolta in the remake merely chews the scenery) but perhaps too many side characters; the Tony Scott movie developed an interesting dynamic between the lead hero and the villain, whereas here it is more an ensemble of villains against the city.\nOne major plus point for the original is that there's no stupid soundtrack. Tony Scott has a dynamic directing style, but he picks horrible urban garbage for his soundtracks.\nBetter villains, better soundtrack, but perhaps a more strangled character narrative. As good as the remake, if not better!",

            "content": "The 70's crime film was built on reality: language, violence, filth... with true stories often unfolding in real-time. \"The Taking of Pelham 123\" is a crisp, dense, real-time crime story. Most people probably never even realized this version existed before seeing or hearing about The Denzel Washington/John Travolta 2009 remade/updated version.\n \nThe 1974 version's premise is pretty simple, A team of hijackers take over the 1:23 Pelham Bay subway train: they want one million dollars in one hour or they start executing passengers being held hostage. Where the idiotic mayor (with a striking resemblance to former New York mayor, Ed Koch) fails to respond to the emergency, the lieutenant of the New York Transit Authority (Walter Matthau) prepares to negotiate with the men and save as many of the hostages as possible. This is no easy task of course, given the unrelenting \"leader\" of the gang, Mr. Blue (yes, this serves as the precedent for Tarrantino's 'Resevoir Dogs,' as do many things in 1970s cinema), played by Robert Shaw, who seems to command the show, making seemingly impossible demands on the authorities. The movie does well with maintaining the pace throughout the picture, with the tension being broken with moments of comic relief. Although, the story remains somewhat undeveloped, since we never really find out why the hijackers have chosen to take over the train. Other than Robert Shaw's character, the hijackers are men of few words.\n\nHowever, in spite of this, the movie is still entertaining, due in large part to a terrific cast of acting veterans and regulars. The cast alone is reason enough to watch it. Walter Matthau is superb in this, as is the ever reliable Robert Shaw. The supporting cast is wonderful. Marty Balsam, Hector Elizando, and Earl Hindmen (\"Wilson\" on TV's 'Home Improvement') who portray the hijackers, and Jerry Stiller, James Broderick, and many other familiar faces serving as Matthau's support team are hilarious. \n\nOverall, I would recommend seeing this movie, before the 2009 remake and then compare. There is definitely enough different in both movies to stand on their own merits and for both to be enjoyed in different ways.",

            "content": "Joseph Sergeant's 1974 classic got a 21st century makeover just a few years ago, in other words, they increased the ransom demanded, crashed more cars, killed more people and gave John Travolta the role as the main hijacker. Clearly Joseph Sergeants 1974 classic is better in every significant way. Taking of Pelham One Two Three went on to inspire the names of Quentin Tarantino's characters in Reservoir Dogs. \r\n \r\nBased on the 1973 novel by John Godley Taking of Pelham One Two Three (not 123) concerns four men hijacking a subway train and demanding $1,000,000 dollars. They also demand that the money should be collected and paid within the hour. If these demands are not met the hijackers will kill one person for each minute that the money is late. Lt Zachery Garber (Walter Matthau). has been asked to negotiate with the hijackers is Lt Zachery Garber (Walter Matthau). \r\n \r\nTaking of Pelham One Two Three is just as nitty, gritty and tense as the best action movies during cinema's golden age, namely The French Connection and Dirty Harry (both 1971) rank as the best action movies of those golden years. Taking of Pelham One Two Three is as 70s action movies go, fantastic fun. It's a typical 1970s action movie stereotypical, racist and sexist, though nothing worth getting worked up about. One of greatest factors of Taking of Pelham One Two Three is the quietly intense performance of the wonderful Robert Shaw as Mr. Blue. Robert Shaw's performance is a dominant one, he demands authority, he quietly, with a menacing growl in his voice, orders the passengers of the hijacked train around and they instantly obey him. With some cracking lines of dialogue 'I could kill every single one of you before you got any closer to me from where you are standing now' Robert Shaw's character, Mr. Blue, authority is not to be questioned. Robert Shaw, for me, makes this film, he has a talent for playing cracking villains, for example take From Russia With Love he played a charming, charismatic and ruthless killer who almost fooled Bond himself. It is Robert Shaw's finest performance but Jaws and From Russia With Love are proving to be strong competition. Robert Shaw's performance is a complete contrast to Travolta, who shouts, swears and spits and delivers an abysmal performance, Robert Shaw is a far more powerful and dominant screen presence then Travolta ever will be, this is clearly evident in Taking of Pelham One Two Three as Shaw bosses the screen in every scene he is in. The performances of the fellow hijackers are less intense but serviceable and Walter Matthau is great as Lt Zachery Garber. \r\n \r\nTaking of Pelham One Two Three is just as tense as The French Connection and Dirty Harry (but the later two the far superior). The discussions between Mr. Blue and Garber are gripping and both actors are sensational together and share a great chemistry even though they rarely share the same screen. However, amongst all this seriousness and tension of this 1970s classic action movie is even a spot of comedy, and low and behold its actually funny. The script, unlike a shed load of the most recent action movies, is full of wit, irony and hilarious one liners. One bloke asks who is going to steal and subway train anyway (while a subway train is being hijacked) and the mayor's wife replies 'eighteen sure votes' when the flu ridden mayor (who has the most laughs) asks what would get in return paying the ransom demanded and a hilarious scene in which Garber is entertaining some Japanese guests under the impression that they do not speak a word of English. It's nice to see a spot of comedy mix perfectly together with the serious and tense aspects, only once every so often does it work quite as well as it did in Taking of Pelham One Two Three. \r\n \r\nThe Taking of Pelham One Two Three benefits greatly from Joseph Sergeant's steady hand and his approach to straightforward, simple story telling. There are no confusing and pointless subplots but just one story about a hijacked train that is told in a simple but great way in a way action movies should be told. The simplicity in the approach to the story makes The Taking of Pelham One Two Three one of the many hidden gems of 1970's cinema which is dominated by The Godfather, Taxi Driver and Chinatown (to name a few). The Taking of Pelham One Two Three tries to poke it's head above the high seas of quality productions in the 1970s. Yet The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is not flawless, the hostages are without a doubt the most irritating group of people on the planet, not one of them are likeable. You almost want Robert Shaw to spray the bullets into every single one of them. The screaming women is possibly the most annoying of the lot but yet taking of Pelham is not really about them its about the hijackers and the discussions with those attempting to compromise and save the lives of those on board, that is where Taking of Pelham shines. \r\n \r\nJoseph Sergeants The Taking of Pelham One Two Three has grown to be a classic of the genre, of course it's not on a par which the likes of Die Hard (the first one), The French Connection and Dirty Harry but The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is entertaining, fast and furious in the only way 1970s action movies can be. For fans of the genre it is essential viewing and superior to the mess that was the bland 21st century remake. Helped greatly by Robert Shaw's tremendous, quiet but very menacing performance The Taking of Pelham One Two Three is fine action movie making. A classic thriller.",

Now this might be considered lack of character development for some, but I thought it was perfect for the effect the movie needs. Also, the amazing score is definitely a standout and puts you into the mood for the type of story being told. It's almost the complete opposite of the Tony Scott remake (which I really like as well), but somehow has the same exact plot. It's funny how only a few things can change an entire movie. Robert Shaw, as usual, does a great job as the mysterious villain that we never quite understand.

The group is led by Robert Shaw (Jaws and The Sting). Walter Matthau is a transit authority cop who is helping to resolve the hijacking and also trying to catch the criminals responsible.\r\n\r\nIn what turns out to be a decent plot and one filled with fine performances, the pace never really takes off for me. There is action and it's well thought out but I really could have used more sinister actions or dialog from Shaw. His characters always felt genuinely vicious and I wanted more of that here. He's calms and cool but quite serious in that he will do what he says... most of the time. I did not appreciate what the story had in store for him and found it almost insulting. You judge for yourself. Meanwhile, Matthau brings a great presence to the story, and an unusual one for him. Most of his roles are much different than that of a law man mixed up with gunmen. He is sarcastic and yet has his wits about him. He perhaps brought more to the film than anyone (surprisingly). \r\n\r\nSargent brings a pretty straight forward story to the screen and it is well directed and not corny like some of his later work (think Jaws: The Revenge). This is perhaps his best work and he got to share it with many screen greats including Jerry Stiller. In conclusion, this is not high octane thrills and it's not a sedative either. I have really no wish to see the remake so I will hold onto the memories of the decent action thriller from 1974. (C)",

Jaded as I was by the crime rate in those days, that image freaked me out. Too young to see an R rated movie at the time (by today's standards it's a PG), I saw it when it came out on network TV, and WOW!!! This is a wonderful work of suspense that's totally character-driven, with Walter Matthau, Robert Shaw and all the rest giving outstanding performances.

It is quite a quick moving movie from start to finish, minor at that, without slowing to pause that often. It is a pretty good film, with a very strong cast.",

It's a cartoon and, franky, I just cannot buy John Travolta as an evil GENIUS in any movie. Whatever his assets as an actor, genius brainpower ain't one of them. I've watched him in interviews and while I like him, he's a borderline mental defective. He should stick to playing clueless thugs and dance happy dimwits. \r\n\r\nThis version, Pelham 1.0, is whip smart and gritty. It hearkens back to the bankrupt, strike ridden, unmanageable New York City of the early seventies and when old fogies like myself point to the early '70s as a golden age for film (if not for America), this is a pretty good movie to use as an example. Even as a plot heavy suspenser, \"Pelham\" was sharp enough to wryly comment on city politics, the media and an agitated urban populace, all while keeping the clever plot mechanics chugging along and not resorting to preachiness. It has a dense script with a fine comic undertone that the new version can't even touch, and Matthau is perfectly, frumpily cast. Despite the far-fetched premise, the setting and the characters are grounded enough in reality to make the story tense and believable. \r\n\r\nThis is a classic cat-and-mouse thriller, intelligent and fun, and there was no good reason to Denzel it up, add comic book pyrotechnics and cardboard villiany. 5 stars.",

Robert Shaw is just balls out awesome. I just love how he's introduced, with a close-up of his feet anxiously shuffling back and forth.

It started off excellently as it wastes no time getting straight into the plot as 4 men board a New York subway and take control of it without the passengers knowing what's going on. Quentin Tarantino is obviously a fan because he ripped off the character names for his film Reservoir Dogs, as the characters are called Mr. Green and Mr. Blue etc. Sadly once the initial take over has been completed and contact is made with Walter Matthau's Lieutenant, the film seems to completely stall and we have to sit through tensionless scenes involving the main hijacker and Matthau talking to each other and Matthau arguing with the subway controller. The film needed a little something extra to happen to hold our intention but it never came. The last half hour is excellent however as the action picks up and the police attempt to take back the carriage but it doesn't quite make up for the previous half hour. \n\nAll the actors playing the hijackers are very good but it's hard to take Walter Matthau as a Lieutenant, it's a bad case of miscasting. The direction is good and the film has aged very well even if the soundtrack gets a little grating at times. \n\nPelham One Two Three is a good film, especially if you like slow burning thrillers, but sadly it's just a little too slow at times to be truly entertaining.",

It concerns a gang of heavy-armed men with machine guns who hijack a Lexington line subway train in Manhattan, and then threaten to kill one hostage per minute unless they are payed a million dollars in small bills. As bad guys go, they don't get much better than these heavies, Robert Shaw is chilling and delivers a memorable performance as Mr. Blue, the mastermind and cold-blooded leader of group, Earl Hindman is superb, as Mr. Brown, who is a genuinely disquieting presence, silent and brooding with a crazy man's glare, Hector Elizondo is terrific in a scene-stealing turn as the psychotic and insubordinate Mr. Gray, the gang's wild card, Elizondo raises the stakes throughout with his itchy trigger finger and naked contempt for the group's leader Mr. Blue. Martin Balsam delivers a fine performance as Mr. Green, the disgruntled TA worker and most reluctant terrorist. Balsam brings a sympathetic quality to his role. On the other side of the coin we have Lt. Zachary Garber of the transit police, played to grumpy perfection by veteran character actor Walter Matthau, who is just wonderful in the role with his hangdog looks. Lt. Garber must ad-lib and shrewdly stall for time until the ransom is delivered or a rescue can be made, but it will become a battle of wits and a deadly game of cat and mouse between the sharp-witted Lt. Garber and the crafty Mr. Blue, that will lead to a nail-biting conclusion. As crime films go, Pelham is uniquely amusing. It is filled with enough jokes and clever one-liners, but screenwriter Peter Stone and director Joseph Sargent wisely play their bad guys straight. With little more than their presence, the hijackers create a tension so nerve-racking that the deaths of innocent people feel both shocking and inevitable. Astute direction by Joseph Sergent with colorful supporting performances by Dick O'Neill, James Broderick, Tony Roberts, Lee Wallace, Jerry Stiller, Kenneth McMillan and Julius Harris. A 70s gem and one of the best heist films of all-time. Highly Recommended.",

The script is extremely taut and nobody explains more than they have to: The hijackers know their plan off by heart, so the police along with the transit company can only react to their demands with only 1 hour to arrange the money before the hijackers start executing passengers.

Tarantino of course picked up on the naming conventions for Reservoir Dogs from this film.\n\nThe film has a nice stripped back feel to it.

Both did a great job.\r\n\r\nThe tension was solid.  Typical movie where they make all new yorkers seem like abrasive, loud-mouthed punks, but I found it funny in this movie whereas other movies it is sort of a distraction.  The movie didn't take itself too seriously, which I think is what made it work so well.  Everytime the captors would make more demands to Walter Matthau's character, he would respond with a smart-aleck burn.  Even the ending was sort of 70s-80s sitcom-like.  Sounds weird, but it worked- the tone of the movie was very consistent.\r\n\r\nBasic plot line was that a group of heavily armed men hold a train hostage to get money as ransom- if they don't get their money by a certain deadline, they will start killing hostages.  How will their plan play out?  Will they get away with it?  There is no deep messages or things to think about with this, so there is no need to go into details.

            "content": "This is a little gem that Hollywood has tried to remake a couple of times since the 1974 original and despite the modern updates this version is still the best in my book!\nFor anyone who hasn't seen the recent remakes or are not familiar with the story, the movie is about a group of guys hijacking a New York subway train and demanding a ransom.\nNow what makes this version so good to me is 2 things, Walter Mathau and Robert Shaw! It's a pretty well thought out little story and the script is good too, but these two actors make it work. Mathau as always is a gem! He has just the right amount of cynicism and humor to make his character both believable and at the same time endearing to us.They could have very easily had a shoot em up tough guy like Eastwood play the hero cop and turned this into a Dirty Harry like vehicle, but instead they played it more real to life.  We get an experienced, but job weary Mathau methodically unraveling the crime in a more method and life like manor all the while working against the clock. On the other side of the crime we have a team of criminals led by a cold, intelligent, professional played perfectly by Shaw.\nOne scene that is definitely worth noting is a group of Japanese subway on a tour of the New York subway headquarters with Mathau when the crime begins to unfold. Also watch for Jerry Stiller of Seinfeld and King of Queens fame!\nGood tight little drama and well worth watching if you have never seen the original!",
