    "summary": "Mabel Longhetti (Gena Rowlands), desperate and lonely, is married to a Los Angeles municipal construction worker, Nick (Peter Falk). Increasingly unstable, especially in the company of others, she craves happiness, but her extremely volatile behavior convinces Nick that she poses a danger to their family and decides to commit her to an institution for six months. Alone with a trio of kids to raise on his own, he awaits her return, which holds more than a few surprises.",

            "content": "Gene's performance is golden. Mabel is a warm and loving person, and it seems like her mental illness is primarily exacerbated by the embarrassment and shame that others project onto her. She is surrounded by selfish and abusive people, the main one being her husband, yet she is always the one being derided. It's sad to see her struggling with her mental health, oftentimes seeming completely lost, but it's also sad to see the behaviour of those around her and towards her.\n!!SPOILER AHEAD!!\nMabel throws a party and dances with the kids and gets committed for it, yet it's fine that Nick can shout and bully and manhandle and ply the kids with alcohol? Such bullshit. This film made me angry. I would punch Nick in the face. Mabel is the one with the mental illness, but it seems like it's everyone around her that's wired wrong. Nick's the one with the real problem... he's deceitful, manipulative, aggressive, and just a general all-round dickhead.\nMabel's return is painful to watch - the fake fawning from the people who fucked her over; the creepy and spineless parents; the husband who sent her away for being crazy and now wants her to \"be herself\" but berates her for doing so; the doc telling her to \"calm down\", as if that ever helped anybody. None of them really care about her mental health, they just want this particular acquaintance of theirs to be \"acceptable\".\nI guess this film is a great representation of the ignorance of and stigma towards mental illness and the toll it takes on families, and the fact that just because someone is \"crazy\" doesn't mean they can't be a better person than the so-called \"sane\" people around them.\nP.S. Did I mention I hate Nick?\nP.P.S. Those poor kids.",

This one is slightly more \u2018connected' than some others, but still contains all his trade-marks:-  overacting, formless overlong scenes, with sloppy camerawork and editing. Many of his \u2018home-movies' appear to have been made to provide work for his drinking buddies and immediate family \u2013 often they seem to play-out more like extended commercials for Booze and King-size cigarettes. \n\nWithin this same formulaic approach, his pals and family consume massive quantities of  alcohol, courtesy of J& B, with endless shots of the bottle labels placed in prime positions of each shot (often with the label facing directly to camera to make sure you get the message) They also smoke back to back, endless cigarettes and whatever else \u2013 in fact, it looks more like these movies might have been designed to keep everyone in free grog and smokes (this, from what we are constantly told, is an accepted endless pastime in Hollywoodland)\n\nThe scripts for any one of these films would be lucky to have handfuls of fully written dialogue pages, but most all run for well over two hours - with endless repetitive scenes that could easily have been wrapped up far more convincingly in 80-90mins maximum. Those who don't mind spending time with a chap who sadly drank and smoked himself into an early grave \u2013 might last the distance, others might be warned to seek more \u2018accessible' entertainment.  Apologies to the fans but ticket sales suggest John was actually a better actor than movie-maker, and it's a pity we did not see more of him in quality mainstream shows such as \u2018Edge Of the City', etc.",

Together, they share a torrid but sincere romance with their children caught in the middle, and the roles taken together offer a searing criticism of domestic life, family structure, and romance. Characters are nailed home by long, discomforting scenes that invite the viewer to squirm in their seats alongside the rotating cast of nervous onlookers. The performances put forth by Rowlands and Falk are nothing short of stellar, creating a disturbing balance in their characters' relationship that seems at first conventionally distressed but ultimately is revealed to be far more volatile, ready to fall apart at the slightest provocation. Perhaps not all of the content was necessary to hammer home the narrative, but each scene certainly contributes. Perhaps the best of the many collaborations between writer/director Cassavetes and Rowlands. (4.5/5)",

It's difficult to recall when a star could within the same scene initiate such discomfort for the viewer that it forces them to turn away, then bring them to tears with their naked humanity. \n\nPlaying alongside Peter Falk as a married couple sharing similar levels of mental and emotional instability, writer/director John Cassavetes shows how society tolerates certain types of eccentricities and outbursts in men, but finds it both acceptable and necessary to institutionalize a woman that doesn't conform to her narrowly defined cultural role. \n\nThe two most emotionally devastating points in the film come when Falk invites the family doctor to the house for a surprise visit to assess Rowlands' mental fitness, and during an awkward and ill-conceived party after she returns home from the hospital. While the first set piece is an extended and excruciating event, featuring a shattering moment when her weeping children are literally hanging onto to her so the doctor won't take her away, and the second occurs during a quiet moment when a psychically exhausted Rowlands repeatedly pleads for her clueless father to stand up for her. \n\nOther films have tried navigating similar territory as A Woman Under the Influence, but none have been able to do so with such raw, visceral power.",

            "content": "With a few minor changes, A Woman Under the Influence could be set in 2020 and wouldn't miss a beat. A husband (Peter Falk) loves his wife (Gena Rowlands) so much that he does whatever it takes to make her \"normal,\" even if that means putting her in situations you know aren't going to end well \u2014 I'm looking at you, dinner scene with his entire crew. I would say Gena Rowlands as Mabel Longhetti steals the show, but she's the star from the start. Mabel doesn't represent the typical association with mental illness \u2014 on the street, committing crimes, doing drugs \u2014 but the suburban housewife who can seemingly turn it off when she needs to take care of her children. Of course, there are the big moments, I mentioned one earlier, but it's the little things, the mannerisms and talking to herself, even when she isn't the focus of the shot, which makes the entire performance not just convincing, but special. During the tense scenes, of which there are ample, the Cassavetes pulls in the camera tight, as if what we're going through isn't enough already. While I think we like to believe we handle mental illness better in 2020, I was surprised to see how much more open Nick, her husband, and the rest of her family and friends handled her situation. He even threw her a welcome home party \u2014 which wasn't the wisest idea \u2014 but his heart was in the right place. Nick, the working man for the city of Los Angeles, by the end of the film, is exhausted, uncertain, but just loves his wife and seems to accept his role in the family. It's not a conventionally happy ending, but it's a satisfying one. Thirty minutes definitely could've been shaved off of this film and it would've had the same impact. I would think any movie buff would need to watch it at least once.",

            "content": "The performance of Rowlands, nominated for Best Actress, is really what sells the film. However, the film is overly long. There are dining scenes in the film that continue an excruciating amount of time. Some of Falk's character choices are questionable. He understands that his wife is unstable. However, he invites numerous people to his house without thinking about how his colleagues will react to her behaviour. A similar situation happens at the end of the film making the audience question if the husband has evolved as a character at all. The wife's repeated uneasy mannerisms become tiring until half way through the film where more characters are introduced and the each actor's performance can really shine. The cinematography is decent; as shaky cam and a lower FPS are used to show the manic and disorienting state of the wife. As previously stated the film seriously needed an edit and script could've have been considerably tighter. Rowlands was beaten by Ellen Burstyn at the Oscars that year in a throughly deserving win. Out of the four Best Actress performances I have seen from that year I believe Rowlands was second to Burstyn's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, followed by Dunaway's Chinatown and Lenny's Petrine. The direction of the film by Cassavettes was solid if nothing special sometimes losing it's way and some scenes becoming tiresome. He was nominated for Best Director that which out of the five nominees that I have seen, I would to rank his effort last behind, in ascending order, Fosse's Lenny, Polanski's Chinatown, Truffaut's Day For Night and of course Coppolla's magnificent The Godfather Part II (winner). Overall, apart from some enthralling scenes by very capable actors, the film takes so long to get to these scenes and repeat itself over and over again that already nearly tired out. Anyway, this film should be watched for it's performances and a quite interesting take on a subject matter that has been done better both before and after this film came out.",

            "content": "\"A Woman Under the Influence\" is a film that I certainly feel that I need to watch again. It's one that proves to be so difficult to catch each and every subtlety and moment as you move through the story. I found myself liking it and hating it all at the same time. Part of why I liked it was because it proved to be a relatable story in the slow downfall of a woman stuck in the monotony of stay at home motherhood. I also disliked it for the same reasons in that it was so difficult to watch her downfall. So many people faulted her so much for how she behaved rather than sought out to get her help and guidance and help her get better. It made me feel extremely conflicted in that I empathized with Mabel, but I also empathized with Nick. I had a hard time rooting for them both at the same time. It seemed that they both wanted the same things; however, they were never able to be on the same wavelength with it. From my perspective, the film was a success in that it told a human story that we had never seen before. It broke the mold for films of that type for that time. It served to bring something more out of us as an audience rather than to just make us laugh and cry. Cassavetes made us uncomfortable. When Nick and Mabel had their climactic argument, instead of cutting away when the going got tough, Cassavetes stayed in the discomfort. It truly is a remarkable and difficult thing to be wanting and willing to tell a story like that and Cassavetes truly excelled.",

I hadn't heard of it until I did some research on the best Independent films of all time and it came up on top in several lists. I was intrigued, watched it, and came to the conclusion that this movie is a perfect example of what an Independent film should be: a work of art.\n\nA Woman Under the Influence is the story of Mabel Longhetti (played by Gena Rowlands - wife to the director), a suburban wife and mother, who is mentally unstable. She's crazy, and unusual, which you can see from the start. And her husband, Nick (played by Peter Falk - our generation may know him as the grandfather in The Princess Bride), sends her away to a mental institution for six months.\n\nThis film is full of so much emotion, and that is partly because of the budget. Budgets are something that matter when it comes to these types of films. The budget calls for things to be simpler - costumes and sets, props and makeup, music and lighting, and so on. For example, the house in the movie was an actual house that they borrowed for the movie. They didn't go out and build a new house because it simply wasn't in the budget.\n\n(A Woman Under the Influence was a low budget movie, costing only $500,000 to make. This is a drastically lower budget than, say, The Godfather: Part II - which came out the same year - with a budget of $13,000,000.)\n\nThe movie almost seems like a more realistic reality to me because the budget was so low. There are no special effects, no fancy lighting techniques, no fancy sets; everything is raw and natural, which makes the aesthetic of the movie so unique.\n\nThis movie, like other independent films, is a work of art that captures something real, and address things that large budget, big-hit blockbusters do not address. Movies from that time never really addressed mental illness in the way A Woman Under the Influence does, or any way for that matter, which is one reason that this movie makes such a good film: it challenges the conventional way that mental illness was being portrayed in mass media.\n\nI absolutely recommend this movie. Though, I'll admit it's not for everyone, it sure is a film that lovers of independent films should watch. It's sad, it's dark, and it's a rollercoaster of emotion, leaving you with teary, yet opened eyes. The film is a work of art, just as an Independent movie should be.",

That's what the movie is about: the lack of freedom that the woman has in his own home or even society; even if she wants to just be herself she is pushed around and forced to act in a certain, socialy accepted, way.

I had such an awkward feeling watching the acting from all characters in this film in that I didn't have a clue what ANYBODY was talking about, almost as if I was learning an alien language.  It seemed that no character could speak when I wanted them to nor could they emote in any way that made a semblance of sense or interest.

One damaged by the limitations of his life-experience and the other suffering what can only be surmised as bi-polar disorder. Falk is exceptional in this movie. Both lead actors transcend their craft to a new sort of place in cinematic acting. Each gesture and movement carries power and insight into characters who \"feel\" real. Painful. Awkward. Uncomfortable. Funny. Sad. Tragic. And, ultimately, inspiring glimpse into two people trying their very best to make it all work. Unforgettable. It is interesting how Cassavetes managed to create such a realistic depiction of mental illness way back in the early 1970's before there was any real understanding toward it. Another bit of cinematic magic is the fact that every moment of this film feels as if it were improvised. In truth, every single line was scripted. Amazing film.",

She also shines in her warmer facet during the heartwarming episodes with her kids. Mabel is a dream role any actress would be ever craving for, Rowlands is the performer nonpareil for her concentrated and committed dedication of embodiment without falling into the pitfall of borderline OTT. \r\n\r\nFalk, a flawless pick for an ordinary blue-collar, bedeviled by his wife's unhinged nature and stumped by the futile and consuming communication, improperly catches the worst moment to throw a surprise party for Mabel, his quandary could be easier to be related by the audiences, besides, his trademark out-of-focus eyes betray his frustration and it is certainly the situation is at his wits' end.  \r\n\r\nThis tiny budgeted film is a family workshop, kinfolks and friends constitutes the cast, e.g. both Cassavete's mother Katherine and Rowlands' mother Lady plays the in-laws in the film. Overall the film is a challenging project which unflinchingly debunks the underbelly of the marital bond, \"till death us do apart\" is so harrowing to listen under this circumstance. During the conjugal tug-of-war, Cassavetes pluckily interposes their children into the game, at the eleventh hour, it is the kids' relentless endeavor thaws the edginess induced by the heavy volley of laborious squabbles. \r\n\r\nFinally I must bellyache about the befuddling timeline, when Mabel brings a stranger to her house at night, it is the next morning Nick and his workmates come back from working, they have an unpleasant midday dinner, then it is the morning after Mabel's mother brings the children to home before school, right? Then how come later Nick's mother accusing Mabel for adultery at \"last night\"?  Help me out here, it does bugs me, otherwise it is an indeed unique film of its own kind, although it doesn't gratify my satisfaction thanks to the frivolous and dreary altercations, I am always coveting for a bit more from the story plainly extracted from the lifelike experience, other than accentuates the tedious and irksome sensory overkill, it would be nicer if a sensible approach could lead us to a palliative nostrum to set our cerebral phase back to a normal state.",

Mis-communication, its causes and grave consequences is one of films main points. That central scene with neighbor kids' visit and ensuing fight is one big mis-communication. Otherwise, she explains herself, she is not \"that stiff wife\". Probably most of her antics would be nothing but fun and kindness if people were open to her means of expressing herself.\nExtremely dramatic movie: lost appeal to father to stand up for her; husband unable (in the end) to tell her that he loves him. Only kids, like her yet un-inhibited, fight for her (and thru entire movie have excellent report with her), but she refuses to leverage them. In adult world, among those who wield power Mable is alone and mis-understood.\nAnd very final scene, when husband and wife remain alone... At first I was baffled, I thought it was mute and anti-climactic. But then I felt the fakeness of its idyll and of its sanity and that finale tied the movie as probably no alternative could. \nJust great.",

It couldn't be more normal, except the wife is coo-koo, and the husband is an abusive prick. Both had amazing performances, but especially Gena Rowlands. If you've seen the 2010 film Blue Valentine the style is incredibly similar. I think the main draw back of the film is that it tried to be too genuine.

I felt that the film could have been trimmed down some, but the length wasn't to big of a deal.

            "content": "This was a highly entertaining movie. As a person who grew up in the 70s, I was most entertained by all the 70-isms in the movie. 70-isms are things that were commonplace in the 70s that would be frowned upon today. I'll list the ones I remember:\n\nThe kids had to be reminded to put on shoes before they left with their grandmother. There was no hint of a car seat in granny's car. Nobody had on seat belts. The little girl had on a short dress and in every single scene she appeared in, her underwear were showing. At one point, she is running around the house naked and they show everything. This kid did a nude scene. In modern days, thanks to pedophiles, we would call that kiddie porn. \n\nPeter Falk's character refers to one of his black workers as a monkey behind his back. That may not be a 70-ism. The way everyone interacts at the dinner and at the party had a very 70's flow. One of the work crew playfully slaps PF's wife on the behind at the dinner. One of PF's friend's wives tongue kissed him just because at the party. \n\nPF's character had not visited his wife in the mental hospital even though she was there for months. You know this because he was surprised by her condition when she came home. She has a mental breakdown and he smacks her. This is a 70ism because there was rampant ignorance about mental illness in the 70s. People did not know what to do around someone who was mentally ill. In the beginning of the movie, she tells her husband she will become who he wants her to be. This is not a common thing in the 21st century. \n\nI had a few problems with the film. Some of the scenes went on too long. I found myself thinking, ok, I get it, she's weird, next scene please. Her symptoms seemed to be a mish mosh of multiple mental illnesses. At first I thought they were going for bipolar, then she had dementia, then she was dancing in the street playing chicken with the cars. The ending was creepy. My feeling was that she was not gonna make it through the night.",

            "content": "One cannot be a fan of independent cinema without acknowledging the contributions of John Cassavetes. A Woman Under the Influence, arguably his best film, sees the humanistic auteur at the top of his game (observant camera work, extending shots to pick up his characters' idiosyncrasies, mixing and matching shot scales and eye lines, etc.). I love his style of filmmaking, but if there's one criticism, it's that he can times be so observational that it allows room for viewers to misunderstand the point. This film is a perfect example of that.\n\nI didn't believe we are meant to wonder who is \"crazier,\" Mabel (played by the truly brilliant Gena Rowlands) or her husband (a terrific Peter Falk). Cassavetes makes a strong, bold (and rarely voiced) point...it is the trappings of contemporary life that makes us on the verge of insanity. Mabel loves her children, loves to dance and sing -- and for that she is committed. Her \"unidentified mental illness\" seems to intensify when her husband mistreats and was physically and verbally abuses her (in my opinion, going a bit crazy after someone slaps you is probably healthier and saner than being polite, demure, and rational).\n\nMabel loves life, shows her love without apology, and is severely punished for it. Everyone else in the movie struggles to calm everyone down and avoid showing too much emotion. While this may be more socially acceptable it isn't sane or even healthy. Humans are emotional beings, and this hallow societal expectation of \n\nCassavetes tips his hand and proves his point when Mabel comes home from the institution. She hasn't seen her children, husband, and family for 6 months and people assault her, some she has never even met, before she even leaves the car. When she does get inside the safety of her own home the people who put her away and told to forget the past greet her with small talk and politeness. Then when she finally sees her children after being told to \"wait a minute\" she says to herself that she wants to remain calm and show \"no emotions.\" It seems obvious that this is a perfectly acceptable time to be emotional but fresh from the institution she know being normal doesn't allow you to be emotional. Emotions are scary, messy, and inconvenient and I for one am thrilled that John Cassavetes shed such a great light on these ideas. It's a bold, original film in every sense of the word, and it does what all good cinema does: it makes you think about your relationship to the world.",

            "content": "\"A Woman Under the Influence\" boasts a superb lead performance from Gena Rowlands, but there's something about writer-director John Cassavetes' male characterizations that really grates on me. He's not interested in thinking men. Instead, he adores these old-school macho types who mask everything with bravado and believe the ultimate life moment is to crowd around a table with other loud, manly men while backslapping each other, smoking and drinking. Such scenes are like watching a Lions Club meeting.\n\nRowlands deserved her Oscar nomination (she lost to Ellen Burstyn in \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\"), but her character's inappropriate, manic, eager-to-please behavior hits its note very early and doesn't develop much further. The script reveals little about her background and doesn't give much sense of whether she was born this way or has a post-traumatic condition. A 146-minute film ought to dig deeper. Why didn't we see any of her treatment at the psychiatric hospital?",
