            "content": "\"The Conversation\" is a tense thriller that explores how paranoia can take over all aspects of everyday life once something disturbing is discovered. Paid to eavesdrop on two people in a public place, Harry Caul ( Gene Hackman ) records the conversation and after some work produces a tape with clarity for his client. However Harry is riddled with guilt from a previous job that led to the people involved being hurt and both a woman and child murdered. This leads him to question his actions and clearly the job he is doing. \n\nDespite colleagues, friends and suppliers of surveillance equipment looking up to Harry as one of the best in the business he clearly has lost his edge and his way. This is shown over a period of time through various actions. His flat is easily broken into by his landlord and his mail read. Harry is easily duped at a trade show by a competitor who bugs him with a pen and his girlfriend states \"once I saw you up by the staircase , hiding and watching for a whole hour\". Meanwhile despite his phone being supposedly unlisted both his landlord and his client have the number and to his surprise call him.\n\nAfter listening many times to the tapes of the conversation, Harry believes that the two involved fear they could be hurt or even killed for their actions. However a trick is a trick or job is a job ( according to his girlfriend/ escort ) but riddled with guilt he fails to deliver. Once again he shows his unprofessionalism by allowing the tapes to be stolen ( by his girlfriend/ escort ) \n\nAs the film concludes it becomes clear that conversations can be misinterpreted and may not be as obvious as first thought. Harry's paranoia is compounded even more once he discovers the truth behind \"The Conversation,\" which results in a very satisfying ending.",

Francis Ford Coppola is at his best with no bloated runtime and extended dull moments many of his films can have. Quick and efficient editing with the sound tape sequences and slow build moments with various character scenes.\n\nHarrison Ford even shows up for a bit in 1974 whats was he doing an episode of Kung fu, that's right, TV guest spots. The sound is not the main showcase, the cinematography is front and center and then the sound just brings the entire film to life. Brilliant Film making.",

It is, however, definitely a thought-provoking film, one of its time (it dating from the mid-1970s) but its a pretty solid watch, although it's hardly an all-out action/thriller. The characterisation is good and the cast is decent. Thinking about it, the plot is somewhat like that of Rear Window, I suppose, only perhaps on a bigger scale (in a different context). I thought it was interesting that this film was both written by and directed by Francis Ford Coppola and it was released a couple of years after the infamous classic The Godfather. This film does feature some fairly mumbled dialogue, which may frustrate people but then given the plot, this is perhaps to be expected, if to a small degree. I found the paranoia aspect of the plot particularly intriguing. I suppose nowadays its probably more likely that this sort of thing goes on, with my thoughts being on the phone-hacking scandal of not that long ago.  The noise of tapes being, I assume, either rewound or fast-forwarded, in between scenes, I found to be a little sinister, plus some darker scenes in the 2nd half of the film. I suppose you could say it shines a light on voyeurism, intimidation and obsession, to an extent and it becomes more sinister towards the end, with metallic sounds in the background. Oh and the saxophone music was pretty cool too.\n\nOverall I would recommend this film, yes.",

The final 10 minutes do deliver a very strong punch and make the film a rewarding watch overall. This is a Classic New Hollywood Film and a Classic Thriller Overall. The Pacing issues is what keeps this from being an All Time Classic.",

Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Conversation\" is a masterpiece and while not as known or known as his Godfather films, nonetheless  is a more personal and thought provoking film that presents us with a Director at his best.  Throughout the editing, the details are in place to make the film realistic and personal and really captures the essence of Gene Hackman's intricately detailed and isolated character.  Not only does Gene Hackman give a beautiful and low-key performance that portrays his character Harry Caul flawlessly, but he does this so well that we are permitted into his scant and hidden existence.  The score by David Shire is wonderfully subdued and haunting but most importantly adds the sense of lonely atmospheric qualities to the dark and taut thriller, complementing it perfectly!  While not holding quite the reputation of his other master works such as \"Apocalypse Now\" and The Godfather films, \"The Conversation\" is so personal and so haunting that Coppola gives viewers something just as important and timeless as any of the more popular works, if not more so!",

            "content": "Firstly, I suppose such a film would have even more relevance today as we are all spied upon so much.\n\nThen Harry Caul. At first we think he just very professional, even a little ethical, but slowly you start to see he is a bit damaged then more and more like a loon - a progression. Obviously Coppola made a point with Caul that he is 'just doing a job', Caul repeats it many times, partly it's the character - maybe Caul actually believes it or maybe he is trying to convince himself because of the family that was murdered. I wonder though if Coppola is also making some ethical point about the world - that people who actually do surveillance in real life may think the are innocent but really they have blood on their hands no matter what they convince themselves of. Coppola also shows the degradation of the mind that can occur with unethical behaviour (like spying) and even ends up with full on karma: the man who spies gets spied upon. Then there is also the ethical point about cheating, an important point but don't think it is one Coppola was really trying to make.\n\nThe film overall I thought was very good - like back when American films were good - big longs scenes that don't need to change every two minutes or require lots of action and special effects. Also, long periods without backing sounds - just dialogue or even just silence.\n\nA large part of the film was it's progression, this happened on different levels. The progression of the character we have mentioned. The settings progressed too - starting our very light, wide open spaces, people were happy but they become more and more claustrophobic and darker lit -and just darker (blood coming from the toilet) ending of course in his demolished bleak apartment. The character's interactions became more and more edgy throughout. I like how the story progresses slowly as the audience is revealed more of 'the conversation'. The soundtrack too starts with jazz, bongos, moves on to light airy piano music and then slowly becomes more and more sinister.\n\nThere were a couple of twists at the end - the first more obvious where all along we thought the director was the bad guy when it was the others. The other more subtle - there is that moment when he is playing sax again at the end and we think everything is alright and we are back to the happy start but then he completely loses the plot.",

The only redeeming thing in this movie was Hackman‘s acting and honestly I found it interesting to see Cindy Williams in a dramatic role. She's got a great speaking voice. SPOILER ALERT!!!! I thought a much better twist and ending would have been if the Cindy Williams character had been a relative of the family massacred as a result of Hackman's character's previous surveillance fiasco and was setting him up to see if he'd developed any sense of remorse for previous actions. If he handed over the tapes then she could seek her revenge. That's what I had hoped would happen, but unfortunately not.",

            "content": "Gene Hackman plays a reclusive surveillance mastermind, so terrified by the prospect of tasting his own medicine that he's grown certifiably obsessive-compulsive. He's also a deeply religious altruist, which stands in sharp contrast to the seedy nature of his business and the people who pay him for it. This inevitable internal conflict peaks when he eavesdrops on a similarly skittish young couple and begins to worry that his recordings will lead to their death.\n\nThe suspense takes some time to develop from there, as Hackman's gentle spy leads us through the nuts and bolts of his work, navigates a trade show (where, to his dismay, he's recognized) and swings between concern for the subject and obligation to the client. I found the head-down technical bits fascinating, a close inspection of modern mechanical and electronic wizardry in a more primitive form. Today, it seems like almost anything is possible without much extra effort from the operator, and there's a lost sense of challenge and intimacy in hand-waving all the details like that. The Conversation celebrates its knowledge of just how nuanced and difficult this work really was, and while that often slows the pace to a crawl, I enjoyed it all the more for taking the time.\n\nThe more dramatic twists and turns deliver, too, but those all arrive in a rush at the very end, an explosion of stress and fright that heralds a jarring tonal shift. It's effective, with a major script-flip moment that lingered with me for some time and a rewarding, if not happy, resolution, but it's also very sudden and overwhelming. The preceding hour of quiet contemplation and neatly-dodged confrontation had almost lulled me into a trance. Hackman is excellent, as is John Cazale, an under-appreciated favorite of director Francis Ford Coppola. Baby-faced Harrison Ford also pops in for a few scenes, one of his earliest film credits, and leaves a lasting impression.",

All of the audio, from the evolution of the titular conversation itself to the jazz soundtrack that the protagonist employs to cope with, or drown out, the former, is used and edited flawlessly.

            "content": "Perhaps the least widely popular of Francis Ford Coppola's 1970s masterpieces this is a less outwardly dramatic film than the rather glamorous The Godfather (1972) or the dreamlike Apocalypse Now (1979). What this film lacks in glitz it more than makes up for in it's ability to build a climate of fear and unrest as the tensions between regular people and those in power are explored. The influence of the film can also be seen as there were traces of this film in The Lives of Others (2006) and Three Colors: Red (1994) which displays how excellently it employs the tropes of the conspiracy thriller. I found myself swept up in the paranoia that the film builds and while I knew that the film would be great I expected it to be an ‘eat your vegetables' experience rather than a genuinely exciting one.\n\nSurveillance expert Harry Caul, Gene Hackman, is anti-social and paranoid due to his work as he becomes concerned with whether he is hurting the wrong people through his work and worries that people are spying on him. His current targets are a young couple who walk around among a crowd of people in the hope that they will not be heard revealing their plans. Caul obsessively goes over the statements that the couple makes as their words could have several meanings and he sympathizes with their seeming youthful innocence. Caul refuses to hand in the recordings of their discussion and angers Martin Strett, Harrison Ford, who sends a manipulative prostitute, Meredith, Elizabeth MacRae, after him to steal the tapes. Caul becomes obsessed with preventing harm coming to the woman in the couple and books a motel room next to the room that the woman had planned to meet at. While he believes that she has been murdered he is shocked to discover that he himself has been duped.\n\nFear is often derived from insecurity about oneself and it quickly becomes obvious that Caul's concerns about his client's employees spying on him is directly related to his insecurities about his social ineptitude and ability at his job. These fears are brought together when his girlfriend Amy Fredericks, Teri Garr, needles him on whether he is ever going to open up to her and describes witnessing him hiding in his apartment for hours. Hackman's quietly pained expressions and the feeling that Garr is attempting to bring up these points as lighthearted while also belying a deeper meaning. His refusal to emotionally engage and difficulty in confessing his religious guilt are all expressions of his self hate which eats away at him as he tries to worm his way out of believing that the couple he has spied on are in danger. The pain we feel as ordinary humans is reflected in this man who despite being respected by his peers lacks the self confidence to admit his own flaws by opening up to others.\n\nHis self hate reduces him to a fearful mess as he can't escape himself when his only ability is taken away as he realizes that even he can be manipulated and followed. We witness him tearing apart his spacious home and ending up with only his saxophone as a comfort with the knowledge that he will no longer have the opportunity to influence others. The movie encourages us to be honest, to confront our feelings in this way as we see what happens to a man when he emotionally represses himself to the point of going insane. Very few actors could have done as much with this role as Hackman does with his understated, natural performance that is in line with the tone of the rest of the film. He does not have the arrogant, flashy swagger of Don Corleone because he does not have the wealth or status of that man. He is overweight, in his 40s without the wisdom of a mafia leader and lacking in the ability to command respect from even the most diminutive of rivals. This is a performance without vanity and the movie as a whole is all the better for it.\n\nFor those who haven't seen this film, many have not if I am correct, it is well worth their time and while it requires more patience than the traditional gangster film it is a rewarding experience.",

Hackman's performance is so convincing that one watching may look over their shoulder. There is not a likeability in his character, but his performance keeps your attention the whole time. You can feel the paranoia his character is facing and it reflects onto your viewing experience. \n\nThe feeling of surveillance is present throughout the whole film. Lenses are used to demonstrate cameras that are used in the film. Especially during the opening scene, the camera lens give a feeling that you are watching that conversation take place. However for the rest of the film, camera angles showcase Hackman's character in a way that feels as if you are in their presence. Wide shots can give feeling of a security camera watching over the scene taking place. The feeling of surveillance is left ambiguous. \n\nAmbiguity is used in the best possible way for this film. The ending is so powerful since it answers some of your questions, but leaves you with so many more. Who did what? Who knows what? Why? How? Hackman's portrayal demonstrates how anyone would act in a similar situation.  \n\nIn conclusion, the feeling of surveillance and the ambiguity of the film leave you with a paranoia of what is going to happen next even after the screen goes to black. The soundtrack is also phenomenal. ",

            "content": "Since releasing the movie between The Godfather and The Godfather II, The Conversation was an easy film to overlook. This hidden gem, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, follows the unsettled and paranoid Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who tapes the conversation of a couple he's been tasked to record. Caul tries to separate his personal opinions from his job, but guilt and trauma from his work causing the death of others conflicts with his morals. The events that follow lead Harry spiraling into a paranoid state, and the audience follows. Sonic flashbacks of the conversation held between the couple ring throughout the film,  putting the audience on the edge of their seats, not to mention a petrifying soundtrack that haunts you long after the movie ends. One of the most haunting scenes of the movie occurs after an alleged muder takes place. Caul walks into what should have been the scene of the crime, looking for any traces of murder, he makes his way to the bathroom, flushes the toilet, and the toilet spurts up blook, as if to tell Caul that his work is disgusting. This particular scene left me paranoid out of my mind. I was hesitant to flush the toilet for days. The lines between reality and imagination are blurred, and we are left to wonder what actually took place. Caul has the tools to access all the information he wants, yet he fatally misinterprets it. \nCopolla once mentioned that anyone who writes a thriller is a student of Hitchcock, but this movie exceeds any expectations from someone who would just be an understudy of the creator of thrillers himself. The ending scene where Caul tears apart his apartment looking for the bug is so iconic, it has been reimagined in the show Better Call Saul. The Conversation is Coppola's hidden masterpiece, and a marker of what a magnificent director he is. ",

            "content": "The Conversation serves not only as a staple of classic American Cinematography, but also as a staple to 70's society and culture, one to which we can compare our modern experiences. Take the opening scene as an example: After being introduced to Mark and Ann's conversation, we are shown a photographer in the distance. When granted a closer look we can see how, dressed in all black and with an extreme zoom lens, he almost looks like a sniper, scope and all. Today's audience might register the photographer as something completely different than what he is; and if the movie was made today, the scene's layout and costuming would probably be different to show the distinction. Another, more obvious, example is society's relationship with modern-day surveillance and privacy, and how that has altered since the 70's. Of course, this was a topic of discussion in those days as well, let's not fail to mention Watergate, but has since grown with technological advancements and cultural shifts. We now see active cameras filming individual aisles in Walmart and I constantly see laptops that have tape or stickers covering the camera. Other than being a historical staple in American culture and cinematography, The Conversation is without a doubt one of the best psychological thrillers. Again, take the opening scene as an example: it opens with an extreme long shot of San Francisco's Union Square, filled with people walking around. The camera is slow to anchor in on our main character, even throwing the viewer off a bit by closing in on certain passerby while a mime performs. Who will the camera stick to? - who will be the person that will initiate the plot? Already a theme of doubt is being enlisted, we're being reminded that surveillance is nondiscriminatory, the camera could land on anyone, and anybody can be unwarily watched and recorded. The slow camera work also allows us to understand Harry's discrete nature early on in the film, he, as a surveillant, could be anybody. About halfway into the opening scene we can hear a distorted warbling sound, one that seems almost non-diegetic, or not coming from the movie's environment, but instead from inside the mind of one of its characters. The sound distills a feeling of unease and anxiety in the viewer, and continues throughout the film, soon enveloping Harry and driving him somewhere close to madness as he begins to, for the first time, wonder what it is he is recording. He is, for the first time, fully confronting the impacts of his career, and even trying to proactively stop it. The distorted noise serves as a constant reminder that there's something important being said, that much is evident, but what is being said? The first listen generates a passing question, but by an hour, we're left wondering what is so important about that conversation? - what's its significance, why is wanted, and who exactly will it impact? The Conversation is a stimulating film that will leave you digesting and dissecting it for days. ",

            "content": "    This is one of Coppola's masterpieces, a film that conveys different shades of surveillance and paranoia. The action of the movie revolved around the protagonist, Harry Caul, who works as a spy. In this film, his \"assignment\" is given by the director of a big corporation and that way we understand what Harry's job rank is in the society. He has to record a conversation of a couple that is taking place in a crowded outdoor plaza. After his job is done, he started to feel guilty for his actions. We see this in multiple scenes throughout the movie like when he goes to church to confess his sins or when he is having a nightmare where the woman that he recorded the conversation of and him are present. The scene of the nightmare is set outside and it has tones of grey with smoke in between him and the woman. Later in the movie we find out that the woman is the director's wife and, the man she was with at the plaza in the introductory scene is her lover. The director hired Harry to record their conversation so that he could make sure his wife is loyal. \n  The entire film is about espionaje, paranoia and invasion privacy. Every scene has one of these factors included. For example, the first scene, starts as a bird-eye view of a crowded plaza and a jazz song playing in the background that helps the viewer understand the time this was filmed. The camera gets closer to the people in the plaza very slowly, first following a mime and then a man with a grey raincoat, later introduced as Harry. This is a compelling scene because the camera sees everything from above them all. The camera was positioned above everyone else to make it look like there is someone knowing everything and spying on everything, maybe a holy figure. This is emphasized in the film by two scenes. First, when Harry turns to religion to try to redeem his past and second, in the last scene where his paranoia gets out so out of control that he destroys a statue of Mary in his house. \n Another example of surveillance is in one of the best scenes of the film, when Harry attends the surveillance fair where he attends a presentation by another man in the field. After the presentation, he talks to Harry and gives him a pen that he puts in his shirt pocket. Harry brings people from the fair to his workplace, which is in a warehouse. The location of it makes the point that he is private person. Here more invasions of privacy take place, first him inviting people to his workspace, and then his assistant telling them about his project assigned by the director. The last scene that I thought was a very striking moment for the viewer to see who the protagonist really is, is when he is confessing something to an woman at the party while they are alone and finds out that he was being recorded by the pen in his pocket. He then lashes out and tells everyone to go home. Throughout the movie we find out that he is in a constant fear of surveillance and invasion of privacy, which ironically, is his job.\n",

            "content": "The Conversation may belong to the mystery and suspense genre, but it it not far to call it a horror film too. The way the camera angles and move portrays different scenery is very similar to typical horror films like The Conjuring, Annabelle, or Insidious. The plot revolves around a surveillance expert named Harry Caul, whom received a job to spy on a couple. Because this movie focused more on the sound and camera work, we see a lot of scene where there would be total silence then followed by sudden or weird sounds. Along with the camera work it zooms in on character help emphasize the facial and the \"feeling\" of that scene. The uses of sound and camera angle allow the viewer to see from the perspective of Harry Caul, the surveillance expert, and this help us visualize the works of Harry Caul. During the scene when Harry dreamt of Ann, the camera constantly shift focus between Harry and Ann which display a kind of interaction between a person and a pet. Adding to the scene is the ambient background noises which made the interaction between Harry Caul and Ann seems more fantasy or otherworldly like. Kind of like how you talk to yourself in the mirror except the mirror had a real body but cannot think. The scene legit made the film seems like a horror movie because in typical horror movies we would see a spiritual medium go to a \"ghostly\" place to consult with a spirit. Much like how Harry Caul interact with Ann. During the murder scene, the silence was broken by sudden a scream then the whole scene came to life with loud noisy as an attempt to scare the audience. Everything about this film gave me a tense feeling where you would expect something to happen, but it doesn't or vice versa. During the end scene, when he received the phone call saying that his house is tapped, cause Harry to go completely insane and tear up his house. The reason I use \"completely\" is because thought out the film Harry show symptom of being insane, adding to the claim are the weird background noisy and the unfocused camera movements. We also see how he smashed the sculpture of Mary, it kind of implement how this movies is related to horror. ",

            "content": "\tThe conversation is a brilliant movie that inspires a feeling of uneasiness within the viewer. It is a subtle thriller that perfectly captures the new age of constant surveillance that the world had just entered at the time and it is even more relevant today than it was back then.The conversation is more than a thriller that utilizes elements of film noire. It is an intense character study of Harry Caul, a surveillance expert, the man who listens on people's conversations. He is hired by a mysterious employer to spy on this couple and record their conversations. Moreover, the movie explores the daily life of a man like Harry Caul who is living in constant paranoia and fear because of his job. He cannot allow himself to connect with anyone or develop any close relations with anyone not even his lover. He is also slowly drowning in guilt of what he has done and what his job does to people and how it can ruin their lives or result in their brutal deaths. There is a definite sense of paranoia and tension throughout the movie that is brilliantly conveyed in the cinematography and sound design of the film. The film mostly relies on silence, dark, and grey colors to build its dreary and bleak world. One of the best illustrations of this is a scene toward the end of the movie where Harry books a room next to the couple he was spying on to find out what his employer will do to them. In that scene the viewer can hear everything, from a small drop of water to harry digging through the bathroom wall to install his listening device to his labored breathing. Then after Harry hears shouting, there is a sudden uncanny silence and so harry goes to the balcony to investigate. Only to end up hearing horrifying shrill screams of the woman, one of the people he was tasked with watching. He quickly shuts the balcony and buries himself in the covers as a loud, eerie, and terrifying siren sound that blends in with the woman's screams rings throughout Harry's hotel room that leaves the viewer anxious and horror-stricken. The sound design of that scene is extremely meticulous and absolutely phenomenal. The entire atmosphere of the film is so creepy and sinister and it excellently displays the slow crawling suspense of the film. Despite its very slow pacing, it is a film that is definitely worth the watch, as the payoff of that slow burn pace is electrifying. ",

            "content": "The Conversation is the single most terrifying movie to listen to. Of course, being a film about a surveillance expert and a conspiracy involving two \"targets\" fearing he is aiding in their deaths through his work, sound should be well done in the film. I say it's too well done. I felt uncomfortable throughout the entire viewing experience. The camera work in the film is reminiscent of surveillance cameras, zooming in on a crowd of people until eventually focusing completely on the \"targets.\" Weird static sounds and repeating speeches are constantly ringing out in the films soundscape, and get more intense as Harry Caul's story continues. The soundtrack also blends extremely well with the soundscape, making for one intense and spastic feeling in one's stomach. The whole movie just feels.. OFF. Coppola keeps the pressure on from start to finish, making a truly effective film about privacy and insanity. I felt so bad for Caul in the film too, he truly hates his job, but he happens to be one of the most skilled in the business. My favorite bit of the film is towards the end. Harry receives a call and his listeners playback audio from inside his apartment. He proceeds to tear apart his entire place, ripping up floorboards, drywall, paint, destroying phones and other random items, etc. The very last thing in his house is a figurine of Mary in prayer. He looks at her for awhile, and finally decides to break it open, only to find nothing inside. He's lost his faith in this moment, as well as his sanity in a way. He's a slave to his own practice, and will forever be listened to by unseen forces, always paranoid of his words. Overall a terrifying movie as well as an important film regarding privacy and what is truly personal information.",

Throughout the film, there is a strand that stands out among many: responsibility. Caul plays the role of a surveillance expert. We watch as he spies on a couple and gives what he has gathered to those who've hired him. He plays a definite role on the outcome of the couple's future; however, he tries to not believe so. We see this depicted in a variety of scenes.\nTo be more specific, there is a scene in the film in which Caul is in a hotel room adjacent to where the couple are staying. By doing this, we can sense that Caul may have some underlying guilt. All he had to do was give his tapes over to his employees and be done with it, but he chooses not to because he is afraid of what will happen. Going back to the scene, Caul walks out into the balcony and he looks through a window and suddenly imagines himself murdering the woman he spied on. Snapping back to reality, Caul goes to blast the television in order to drown out the distorted screaming and hides under the covers. We can feel his fear with the use of the fast motion effect and the close-up focus on his facial expression. This scene portrayed him feeling guilty and responsible, but then immediately denying it by hiding until that feeling was buried. \n",

            "content": "If one is willing to sacrifice a bit of well-timed pacing in return for a rather thought-provoking, yet ambiguous ending then The Conversation may be just right for you. What this film lacks in explicit plot details, it tends to make up for in regards to how it handles cinematography. Lurching tracking shots and even slower pans of the camera weave the viewer in and out of this strangely isolated world Gene Hackman's character, Harry Caul, has ultimately made for himself. Through this lens, we are oftentimes shown just enough, yet nothing close to the full picture - acting as a clear reflection of what Caul's private surveillance work is like. This odd push and pull of being between both in the know, as we receive a glimpse into Caul's practice, and out of the loop, only catching fragments of utterly confusing dialogue, may leave the audience feeling as on-edge as Caul. Perhaps, this is exactly where the interest in this film lies. As the viewer is drawn through the plot's progression, one may find themselves wrapped up in guessing just how this story will turn out.\n\nCoppola makes an interesting use of this incredibly slow build, turning Caul's world completely upside down within the last half hour or so. As cuts between shots and scenes become more sporadic, the audience is left to process this sudden change in pacing - seeing as it stands in such stark contrast to the rest of the film. Caul's actions become increasingly frantic to parallel this. By allowing his skeptical nature to guide his decision-making, tension begins to build at an almost alarming rate. Caul's absolute paranoia is made overwhelmingly clear by Hackman's emotional performance.\n\nAlthough technologically dated, The Conversation raises important questions on the topics of privacy and surveillance that are still relevant today. By showcasing how the human psyche can be affected when these measures are taken to the extreme - or at least when one is made aware of such happenings - this film sparks an important discussion. As its focus leans heavily on cinematic technique and strong sound design, The Conversation makes for a rather interesting film - once you get past any potential desire for a fast-paced storyline or a clear ending.",

He was subject to (in my opinion) careful manipulation from the moment he was offered the \"trick\". The conversation was carefully scripted to make him their accomplice and as unwitting a pawn as the victim himself. I make this point only as a corrective to a plot summary I recently read that missed the plot by a wide mile. It was the writer's mistake to suggest that the conversation was about the girl's husband's murder, when it fact they talked of the fearful price they were to suffer if they were found out, thereby drawing Caul into the role he was to play. They were wise to the fact they were being recorded. This makes a story that is much smarter for the telling. (Guess I will now need to go back and listen for nuance in the conversation, much as Caul did, and try and determine how the writer of the summery could have gotten it so wrong.)",

            "content": "The performance of the lead actor is extremely important to a character study, even more so than other genres. While other factors limited my enjoyment of The Conversation, it undoubtedly succeeds in this area. The Conversation examines Harry Caul, a paranoid surveillance expert with a checkered past, tasked with the simple job of recording a conversation between a young couple. Caul is fascinating, a deeply troubled man who has a conscience, but is dreadful at acting on it in an effective manner. Gene Hackman's performance in the role of Harry Caul makes this movie. Hackman is one of my favorite actors, and this is my favorite performance of his.\n\n In addition to Hackman, there is another actor whose role in the film intrigued me – Harrison Ford plays the assistant to the executive to whom Harry is instructed to deliver his surveillance tapes in a very early role. He pulls off quiet menace surprisingly effectively for someone who I instinctively associate with larger-than-life cinematic heroism. While I delighted at the sight of an actor who defined my childhood, his part in the film is relatively small. As much as I like Harrison Ford, this is a very different type of film than the action and adventure films for which he is famous – although his performance is competent, and it is interesting to see an actor playing against type. \n\nThe Conversation is more unsettling than many horror movies. Part of this comes down to the writing, skillfully creating a world where privacy doesn't exist, a theme which perhaps resonates even stronger today in an age of government surveillance and ubiquitous CCTV cameras. Harry Caul's mental instability also plays an important role in creating an intentionally uncomfortable tone. Equally important to this disquieting atmosphere, however, is the soundtrack. Composer David Shire skillfully uses electronic distortion to create the impression that something is off. This mirrors Harry's realization that his job isn't as routine and harmless as he expected. Other scenes contain a complete lack of music, often using tapes of the titular conversation, both diegetically and non-diegetically, to accent the foreground dialogue. The content of the tapes and the events of the foreground occasionally parallel each other, which is good sound design.\n\nMy main criticism of the film is highly subjective, even by the standards of film criticism, but it significantly impacted my enjoyment of the film. I usually don't mind movies with a slower pace, but The Conversation's plot progresses so glacially that I occasionally found myself becoming bored. Despite this, moments of incredible brilliance ensured that I found the film for more memorable than some films which I found more enjoyable overall. Roger Ebert's placed The Conversation on his Great Movies list, and despite being somewhat lukewarm about the film, I believe it deserves this honor. The Conversation is a brilliant movie, but one which appeals to a limited audience of which I am not a part.",

In today's age, we've seen this story a hundred times, and we've seen it done much, much better. But it's not just the fact that it's dated, far from it. It's simply uninteresting for a large proportion of the time. You get a sense that Coppola attempted to give Hackman's character a backstory, but it just doesn't work - you don't care. It didn't do the film any favours that I watched Brian De Palma's infinitely more interesting and far better executed 'Blow Out' recently; which just highlights the problems with Coppola's movie in far greater detail. Whereas that film had an uneasiness - a constant tension - running throughout, and a main character you could get behind and sympathise with, this film never really picks up any momentum, because the story simply isn't executed very well. It has some merit, of course, and for 1974, the concept of wire-tapping and the consequences of technology were pretty big themes. However, its biggest sin was not being able to make an interesting concept into an interesting or entertaining movie.",

The acting is so real and subtle. The use of sound is actually genius. The music sets the tone. It's just very slow paced that holds back the excellent story and writing.\n\nAround every corner is a beautiful shot. The scenes are set up so well with unique set pieces and wholly originally locales from empty hotel rooms to a surveillance device convention to a business executive's office. It's all fascinating to look at with every moment.\n\nGene Hackman delivers the most reserved and calm performance of his career as private investigator Harry Caul. You are constantly wondering what he is thinking. He is relatable in how human the character comes across as with every choice. He is cautious to the point of being paranoid, but he is also amiable around others if quiet. He loves jazz and listening to those around him. Hackman puts on a true display of complex acting with very little dialogue or movement. He's the perfect private investigator in The Conversation.\n\nA young Harrison Ford delivers a highly believable and threatening performance like no other in his career. Another stand out is Hackman's assistant listener Stan played by the funny and quirky John Cazale. Allen Garfield's amazingly underhanded as the Hackman's rival investigator Bernie. Overall, the entire ensemble delivers excellent acting for their respective roles.\n\nThe Conversation can boast the most creative use of sound and voice recordings in any movie ever. The use of audio recordings and playback are played with by Coppola going in and out of conversations. Coppola utilizes the technology at his disposal for unique moments of listening in and spying on people. The subtle changes in volume and clarity are intentional and superbly executed. I am fascinated at how Coppola managed to pull of such a clever use of audio to enhance the movie watching experience. Audiences will be confused then enlightened in minutes as you solve the mystery along side Hackman's character.\n\nThe music is beautiful piano from composer David Shire. There are long passages of delight piano melodies to liven up the mood, then long stretches of disquieting silence. The suspense is palpable as loud rushes of piano rhythms will soar into hearing with haunting sounds that generate a worrisome atmosphere to The Conversation. The score is excellent and quite memorable too. It really contributes to the suspenseful vibe that The Conversation contains.\n\nThe writing and story is a tale of privacy, investigation, wiretapping, ethics, morality, and faith. Coppola's writing is realistic and quite deep. His topics still feel relevant and profound. He makes Hackman's Harry Caul character a man that must listen in and follow people, taping their lives, and risking their lives just for money. This wears heavy on Hackman's mind as he believes himself a man of faith. It is an intriguing take on ethical questions brought up during the course of an investigator's career.

            "content": "1974 U.S. thriller from the great cinematic direction of Francis Ford Coppola. The Conversation is a film about paranoia as I will reveal later.\nIt follows the work of a surveillance expert Harry Caul (Gene Hackman). Caul works independently as a wiretapper for whoever pays him. Obviously his line of work is quite stressful and he has to overcome moral dilemmas along the way balancing them alongside his deeply religious beliefs.\nThe film builds up quite slowly, indeed for the first hour in reality. About half way through the film I did wonder what I was watching however I am glad I stayed with the film as in the second half the storyline is more gripping.\nThe film as with many of the genre is set in San Francisco  and begins in the bustling location of Union Square as Caul hacks the conversation between a couple whilst huddled in the back of a van.\nWhy are the couple so interesting? It is that question which forms the backbone of the film.\nBasically Caul has been hired to hack the couple's 'private' conversation by what appears to be a suspicious husband.\nThe husband in question is some high ranking Director and he uses his associate Martin Stett played by a pre Star Wars Harrison Ford. Ford looks young and menacing in the role. I saw his name low down in the title sequence credits and wondered when he was going to appear!\nAs the film progresses Caul becomes paranoid about what will happen to the couple after the contents of his surveillance tapes are heard.\nFeaturing some rather dated technology the performances of the actors (Hackman in particular) comes to the fore.\nWill the couple face a murderous end?\nCaul's suspicions grow, quite rightly.\nHaunted by a case several years before in New York, Caul knows the possible nasty side of his work.\nCoppola produced and directed some fantastic cinema in the 1970s and indeed this film is another one.",

            "content": "Gene Hackman turns in what might be the best performance of his career in The Conversation, which is hard for me to say since I adore Hoosiers with all my heart. This film is pure genius and he is a big reason why. In the movie he portrays a private detective named Harry Caul who specializes in audio surveillance techniques. The plot opens with him, along with his team, doing what he does best. However, the plot thickens when he realizes something bad might happen if he completes the job and turns over the tapes. The film is quiet, but that brilliantly builds tension and makes every sound stand out even more. It wasn't long before I felt like I was living in Harry's world, and I understood his paranoia. Any time he would open up and talk, I felt uneasy just like him. Hackman really taps into this character's neurosis and makes him standoffish but also sympathetic. While other people in his life see him as rather insensitive or unfeeling, we are given the benefit of learning what has made him this way. The plot has a few twists in it that I thought worked brilliantly, and it made me want to go back and watch the movie again almost immediately. I have a feeling to a modern audience the slow pace of The Conversation might be a turn-off, but I felt so much tension and paranoia throughout that I thought it worked perfectly. If you have not watched this film, I think it is definitely worth trying, because it is a Francis Ford Coppola masterpiece.",

            "content": "Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) is a surveillance expert who runs his own company in San Francisco. He is highly respected by others in the profession. Caul is obsessed with his own privacy; his apartment is almost bare behind its triple-locked door and burglar alarm, he uses pay phones to make calls, claims to have no home telephone and his office is enclosed in wire mesh in a corner of a much larger warehouse. Caul is utterly professional at work but finds personal contact extremely difficult because he is intensely secretive about even the most trivial aspects of his life. Dense crowds make him feel uncomfortable and he is withdrawn and taciturn in more intimate social situations. He is also reticent and obsessively secretive with colleagues. His appearance is nondescript, except for his habit of wearing a translucent grey plastic raincoat almost everywhere he goes, even when it is not raining. Despite Caul's insistence that his professional code means that he is not responsible for the actual content of the conversations he records or the use to which his clients put his surveillance activities, he is wracked by guilt over a past wiretap job which resulted in the murder of three people. This sense of guilt is amplified by his devout Catholicism. His one hobby is playing along to jazz records on a tenor saxophone in the privacy of his apartment. Caul, his colleague Stan (John Cazale) and some freelance associates have taken on the task of bugging the conversation of a couple (Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest) as they walk through crowded Union Square in San Francisco, surrounded by a cacophany of background noise. Amid the small-talk, the couple discuss fears that they are being watched, and mention a discreet meeting at a hotel room in a few days. The challenging task of recording this conversation is accomplished by multiple surveillance operatives located in different positions around the square. After Caul has worked his magic on merging and filtering different tapes, the final result is a sound recording in which the words themselves become crystal clear, but their actual meaning remains ambiguous. Although Caul cannot understand the true meaning of the conversation, he finds the cryptic nuances and emotional undercurrents contained within it deeply troubling. Sensing danger, Caul feels increasingly uneasy about what may happen to the couple once the client hears the tape. He plays the tape again and again, gradually refining its accuracy. He concentrates on one key phrase hidden under the sound of a street musician: \"He'd kill us if he got the chance\". Caul constantly reinterprets the speakers' subtle emphasis on particular words in this phrase, trying to figure out their meaning in the light of what he suspects and subsequently discovers...\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola´s \"The Conversation\" is yet another movie that has been on my to see list for a long time. Michelangelo Antonioni \"Blow-Up\" (1966) was a key influence on Coppola´s conceptualization of the film's themes, such as surveillance versus participation, and perception versus reality. In this case it´s not what the eye sees, it´s what the ear hears and what sort of interpretation you get from the manipulation of sound to make out a sentence that lies just underneath other sounds and what the consequences might be from that. Caul is a victim of his own profession and with his increasing paranoia he's now made himself the target of surveillance by the same agency who employed him. The film is slow paced and Coppola forces you to pay attention to all the details. Gene Hackman is as always at his best and his portrayal of Harry Caul is of high standard. Rotten Tomatoes consensus for the film is: \"This tense, paranoid thriller presents Francis Ford Coppola at his finest-and makes some remarkably advanced arguments about technology's role in society that still resonate today.\" And this is as valid today as it was back in 1974. Even more so due to the development of modern technology, internet and the world of computers. Roger Ebert's contemporary review gave The Conversation four out of four stars, and described Hackman's portrayal of Caul as \"one of the most affecting and tragic characters in the movies.\" In 2001, Ebert added The Conversation to his \"Great Movies\" list, describing Hackman's performance as a \"career peak\" and writing that the film \"comes from another time and place than today's thrillers, which are so often simple-minded.\" Conspiracy thrillers such as \"The Parallax View\" and \"Three Days of the Condor\" came out in the mid 70s as well adding to the genre and \"The Conversation\" fits in there. There´s suspense, an intriguing ambigious plot and ending, great acting and interesting ways of telling the story camera wise and visually. But, I can´t say I was blown away by the film. It´s a solid piece of film, but not as good as I was expecting it to be. Trivia: \"The Conversation\" won the Palme d'Or at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. It was nominated for three Academy Awards in 1974 and lost Best Picture to The Godfather Part II, another Francis Ford Coppola film. In 1995, it was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".",

It's the American ideal that any person born, regardless of circumstances, is in control of their destiny, and that with hard work, guile and determination, can make something of himself. Whether that was ever the case is questionable, but it seems more than ever that the people in power are in control of way more than we could ever suppose, or would ever want to know.\n\nThis was a nice smaller-scale film that, incredulously, Coppola was able to dish up in a run that is one of the finest a director would ever have, up there with Hitchcock's in the late 50's-early 60's, and Melville a decade later. It's definitely excellent work by Hackman (along with his Popeye Doyle in the pair of great 'French Connection' movies), and is up there with the greatest dissertations ever about the double-edged sword of surveillance, namely De Palma's 'Blow Out' and Antonioni's 'Blow-Up'.\n\nAs a human being, I only wish this film wasn't as important as it is.",

            "content": "Francis Ford Coppola is one of the greatest classical directors of our time. He is most known for his Godfather trilogy and Apocalypse Now. \"The Conversation\" is a crime thriller directed by Coppola, and stars Gene Hackman and Harrison Ford.\n\nHarry Caul (Hackman) is a surveillance specialist who works for privatized companies. Using his equipment to spy on people's conversations, Caul is hired by a mysterious client (Ford) who has him tail a young couple. While going through the recorded material, Caul hears the subjects discussing that they may be in danger. Fearing he may have just participated in something terrible, Caul struggles within.\n\nIn most of his films, Gene Hackman is pretty energized. In this film, Hackman gives a shockingly reserved and subdued performance. It was an incredibly different performance compared to his other films. His character is really secretive, and doesn't enjoy talking about himself. Unfortunately, you don't really get to know the character, which makes it difficult to actually like him. However, you can tell he is struggling within, wrestling with the moral implications of helping his client. If not for Hackman's great performance, the central character would have fallen flat.\n\nAs a film, The Conversation is a tightly wound thriller that succeeds because of its tension. This film has to be digested. It's quite a slow burn to say the least. What makes it work is the writing and direction. The film's script is very well written. Francis Ford Coppola is a masterful writer and director. This film is very tense, and Coppola builds this tension throughout the film. As each minute passes, the tension rises. The climax of the film is incredible, and jaw dropping.\n\nUnfortunately, I failed to enjoy the film as much as it seemed others did. The central character, while brilliantly played by Hackman, is largely uninteresting. He just isn't well written, and its hard to actually like him as a character when you know nothing about him. You are, like the other characters in the film, in the dark about who Caul is. Maybe this is what Coppola was going for. Finally, large portions of the film were noticeably slow for me. I feel this is a film I need to watch again to formulate my final thoughts.\n\n\"The Conversation\" is in many ways an impressive picture. The writing, direction, and performances are top notch. The film is very well shot by cinematographer, Bill Butler. While the film is tense and thrilling, it is noticeably a slow burn. The central character-while brilliantly acted-is largely uninteresting. However, this is an impressive film in regards to its immense tension and shocking ending.",

In Harry Caul, Coppola finds a man desperately trying to hone in on the most minute details of his career in an attempt to find a larger meaning in his paranoid, isolated existence (Coppola fittingly cites Antonioni's Blowup as a major influence), ultimately finding nothing in the process. He reveals nothing about himself to anyone, holes up in warehouses and apartments to pour over the same recordings over and over again in order to forget about the existential dread he feels in the presence of other people, this process being carried out to his own detriment. The few final moments don't back down from this boldly pessimistic message, forcing the audience to recognize his lack of identity and the repercussions of the disconnect associated with unrestrained voyeurism, culminating in a powerful restating of Coppola's indisputable technical ability and his knack for telling universal stories through specific persons or groups.",

Gene Hackman plays one of cinemas most uptight introverts, a man so lacking in distinguishing features and characteristics that he's fascinatingly dull. It's obviously more of a movie for critics than the general public, with its slow pace and frequent solemnity, and the mystery is fairly underwhelming as we know almost none of the people involved. The film works much better as a think-piece than as entertainment, and I can't see myself rushing to watch it again, but after seeing it once I believe it to be clever, well-acted and with a near-constant atmosphere of claustrophobia and dread.",

Ironically, the main idea behind the film (tape recording) would be the focal point of one of the worst scandals in American history that was going down as this film was being produced and released. \n\n\nThe Conversation is about surveillance expert Harry Caul (Gene Hackman), who is a legend in his field, but has skeletons in his closet. Supported by his assistant Stan (the always great John Cazale) Harry has been hired to record and report on a couple (Cindy Williams and Fredrick Forrest) by a man only known as The Director (Robert Duvall). As the job progresses Harry begins to worry about what the consequences of the information he's about to deliver will have on the parties lives based on an incident from his past that still haunts him. \n\n\nHackman plays Caul as a very low key individual that doesn't want any attention, yet is the center of attention in his little world of watching and listening. He's an anxious little man that knows his business and understands who to operate his personal life to keep it out of his work life. Hackman had hit it big by this point and The Conversation really is a change of pace compared to some of hos other work, mainly looking at The French Connection.\n\n\nThe other surprising standout in the film is Harrison Ford as Martin Stett, the threatening thug like individual that is the barrier between the world and The Director. Ford's performance is very confrontational, but he doesn't really do anything to give you a reason to fear him. It's all in your head.\n\n\nThe main theme of The Conversation is paranoia. The thing is that the paranoia belongs to Harry Caul. He's the one that's watching people, but he's the most fearful in the film. From the early moments of the movie you see how Harry dictates his entire life to maintain his privacy and you get to the point that you wonder if maybe some of this fear is in his head, held up by Harry having some delusions leading him to fear that history was going to repeat itself. \n\n\nWhere the two Godfather films were expansive films traveling over thousands of miles and involving decades. they're open and airy and give you plenty of room to breathe. The Conversation is the opposite. It's a claustrophobic film that has you breathing heavy from the fear of what's closing in on us. The stinger on all of this is that even though there is no one nearby, you are being held close with the technology that lets you see and hear from elsewhere, which ironically has become even more prevalent forty years later with our advances in tech. The film itself serves as another Coppola classic from his prime era in the 1970's It's a great film that kind of gets pushed away due to the Godfather films. 70's grit at its finest, almost symbolizing the greatness of the cinema of the era.",

Early on we find out he needs the security that only he has access to his apartment and that he does not like being called. He has a paranoia of being watched which makes perfect sense: Harry Caul works on surveillance and listens in on people's conversations for clients.\n\nCaul isn't likable since, like on-screen characters such as Sorkin's version of Mark Zuckerberg or the infamous Scrooge of A Christmas Carol, he is so caught up in his work that he does not connect with people very well. In fact, there is a great lack of dialogue between Caul and other characters within the film - he talks a lot about himself in a dream sequence, and that is the most information we get directly from him; otherwise, he is the unreliable narrator we see so often in the noir genre.\n\nIf not connecting with people is unlikable, it gets worse; we learn from a story told by one of Caul's rivals that one job Caul had in the past resulted in the death of three people. The worst part? Caul didn't care about this nasty result - he simply did his job which the client asked for. People are not relevant to him, so why should he care? But he has a second chance with the story of this film; he assumes a woman will be harmed and makes it his responsibility to protect her. After his attempt to do so there is a major twist which I will not reveal because it shifts the meaning of the film altogether.\n\nThe conclusion may be hard to accept or like because it is pessimistic and somewhat abrupt, but it is important to note Caul ultimately gets what he deserves.",

            "content": "\"We'll be listening to you.\"\n\nI can't think of another director who dominated a decade in the same way that Francis Ford Coppola did during the 70's. Beginning with The Godfather, following it up with its sequel and this film in 1974, and finally closing the decade with the ambitious Apocalypse Now. Each one of these films can be considered among the best of all time, and unfortunately due to the success of The Godfather sequel, The Conversation is often left out of the conversation. I wouldn't rank this one so high up, but I can see its appeal and the fact that the film is as relevant (if not even more) today as it was 40 years ago. Both Coppola and Hackman have each declared that this is their personal favorite movie out of the ones they've worked in, and that just proves how much passion was put into this project. The Conversation works best as a character study of a paranoid and devoted surveillance expert who is so absorbed in his profession that he shuts everyone out of his life. His life is one of contrasts, because even though he is the best at what he does, he is easily a victim as well (it's easy to spy on this spy), he is conflicted about putting other lives in danger with his work (he's haunted about the murder of three individuals as a result of one of his most successful surveillance operations) , but at the same time he is proud of his work and accomplishments. He is considered by his peers to be the best bugger, but ironically he is so concerned about someone spying on him that he shuts everyone out despite the fact that he really has nothing to hide. He lives a persecuted life because that's how far his paranoia has gone, but that doesn't mean he's good at keeping people out, because in several instances we see how easily he's fooled. The focus is entirely on Gene Hackman's character so don't go into this one expecting an edge of your seat thriller. \n\nThe film opens with an extended long shot of a park in San Francisco full of people as the camera slowly begins focusing on a couple walking in circles around the plaza although we can't quite make out what they are saying. There is a surveillance team following them around with microphones, but it's hard to distinguish what they are saying from all the noise. This isn't an issue for Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) who has developed his own technology that allows him to filter out the noise by combining the three separate microphones that his team was using and piecing together the conversation. He is a bit disturbed with what he has recorded and begins having doubts about giving the tape to the person who hired him for the job (referred to as the Director). Harry keeps to himself and acts all secretive, not even allowing his closest assistant, Stan (John Cazale), to know what is disturbing him. When he finally decides to turn in the tapes, he is greeted by the Director's assistant, Martin (Harrison Ford), who says the Director is away on a Business trip. Since he had specifically said to turn in the tapes directly to him Harry decides to return home with the tapes despite Martin's protest. He begins to feel followed and this only intensifies Harry's fears about getting the couple in trouble. At a surveillance convention that takes place soon after, we discover that Harry is a respected man in his line of work although no one knows much about his personal life. \n\nThe performances in this film are great, especially Gene Hackman who delivers one of the best roles of his career. He downplays the paranoia and delivers it in a very subtle manner. Despite not having much screen time John Cazale, Allen Garfield, and Harrison Ford each deliver solid secondary performances. The film's atmospheric tone is set by the grainy camera work and the outstanding jazzy score which help build the tension. However this being a character study, it relies entirely on Hackman's performance. The theme of surveillance also continues to resonate today after the ongoing scandals with Snowden's claims and the increasing advances in technology. The Conversation is a wonderful film that continues to grow on me the more I think of it. It wasn't the haunting thriller I was expecting to see, but it did surprise me at how well crafted the story was and how it centered on this character that is full of ironies and contrasts. The film ends on a brilliant note as well which just goes on to prove that The Conversation belongs to be considered amongst Coppola's best work. It's a shame that after such a brilliant decade, Coppola has never seemed to come close to what he did in those four films. Thanks to the 70's his work will be hard to equal by any director so he still deserves to be considered as one of the best of our generation.       \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

I get anxiety sometimes and I find it difficult to think of anything to say so these socially awkward characters I find relatable and curious, like I'm getting insight about myself in my more awkward moments. Of course these characters usually don't give insight, but they're a curiosity anyway. The scene where he's with the woman and she's flirting with him, in virtually all movies here's the moment where the guy steps in and says all the right things and you get a steamy sex scene. But not here. The scene loses its fire but sparks a new, authentic moment because it defies the \"professional\" way to write a script. \n\nWhy is he so quiet? The answer is really the meat of the film. Guilt, paranoia, being emotionally shut off, having an uneventful life despite his achievements, and so on. He's a man with a heavy mind who's completely absorb with his own personal life to the point of alienation. The Conversation is a story about obsession, heroism and redemption. It's a great performance from Hackman. \n\nHarrison Ford was great, too. He didn't do much, but he did a good job of being creepy. When his face is in shadows I was impressed with the intimating effect. He appeared almost like a ghost coming and going from Hackman's life. At times I thought it was going to turn into one of those schizophrenic movies about seeing imaginary people. His performance also made me miss the old Harrison Ford, before he did all those political thrillers in the 90's. It was also great to see John Cazale. He usually plays an unstable, somewhat dim-witted jerk and a character you're not suppose to like, but he always plays that character so convincingly you can't help but admire him as an actor. The man is trouble. Here he isn't exactly a nice guy, but its the most level-headed character he's ever played. It was refreshing. Cazale is one of my favorite actors, which is amazing considering he hasn't been in many movies. \n\nThe Conversation is a great movie and I highly recommend it if you like movies that make you paranoid. It's brilliant how many of the scenes of paranoia, Gene Hackman isn't really saying much so you don't know what he's thinking, instead the paranoid thoughts occur in the viewers head. At times you don't know if you're watching a movie about a crazy person or a spy thriller that's making you paranoid. \n\nAnother thing worth noting is the film is more important today than it was in 1974. Look at the information coming from whistleblowers today about NSA spying and spy drones and so on. Maybe America isn't Orwellian yet, but it's definitely an interesting topic.",

Malouin: 2) (See our side-bar page \"How We Rate Movies\")\n(Directed by Frances Ford Coppola, 1974)\nWe were this week - thanks to the ever-growing sophistication of the \"Secret Cinema\" program at the new Maple Theater in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan - treated to The Big Screen viewing of Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Conversation.\"\n\nThis film was nominated for a 1975 Oscar for Best Picture, but was beaten out by Coppola's *other* Best Picture nomination, \"The Godfather Part II.\"\n\nIn \"The Conversation,\" Gene Hackman's Harry Caul is a \"surveillance specialist\" who is at the top of his game. Operating out of San Francisco, Harry is a superstar in eavesdropping, He uses technology and machines that he builds himself to record conversations for his clients, conversations that no one else could ever dream of getting down on tape.\n\nDuring the course of the film, we discover that, back on the East Coast, Caul recorded a conversation on a private boat at sea in spite of the participants most careful efforts to avoid being taped. Those tapes led to the murder of three people. Harry insists that his job is merely to record conversations for his clients. What those clients do with those tapes is not his job, and is none of his business. We see, nevertheless, that Harry's strict Catholic up-bringing racks him with guilt over what happens after his tapes are delivered to a client. The murder of those three people haunts him. It forced him to flee New York City and attempt to start over, with a clear conscience, in San Francisco.\n\nAt the opening of the film, however, Caul and his associates are involved in another assignment which could have the same outcome. \"I'm not afraid of death,\" Caul tells himself in a dream. \"I *am* afraid of murder.\"\n\n\"The Conversation\" opens with the long, slow, three-minute overhead zoom in on a crowded scene in Union Square, San Francisco. We slowly slowly slowly move in on the targets of Caul's latest surveillance, a man and a woman who work in a large corporation. This is a difficult eaves-dropping assignment. The man and woman, continually walking in circles in a crowded lunch-time square, firmly believe that there is no way their conversation can be recorded. Harry Caul is an eaves-dropping genius, however. He uses three different sources to piece together the conversation between the man and woman. Later, as he puts together the pieces of that conversation, Caul comes to believe that turning these tapes over to his client is going to result in another murder.\n\nCaul's training and experience have taught him to trust no one- and nothing. He makes his phone calls from a pay phone on the street. He has triple locks on his apartment door and forbids the Manager from having a key. \"If there's an emergency, I'd rather have all my stuff burn up,\" Caul tells the Manager.\n\nCaul has a girl friend - for a while - but she knows nothing about him. She doesn't have a phone number for him, doesn't know where he lives, what he does for a living, nor when she'll see him again. \"I know that sometimes you stand outside my door for an hour before coming in, spying on me, as if you were expecting to catch me at something or other,\" she tells him. \"I've waited for you for a long time,\" she adds, \"But I don't think I'm going to wait for you any more.'\n\nThat statements stings Caul, but he goes to his office to lose himself further in his work. Caul's office is in a small wired pad-locked cage in the corner of what appears to be an otherwise empty several-story warehouse. Again, the isolation of Caul's life is apparent every time we see him working there.\n\nThere's one time in the entire film in which Caul opens himself up to another human being. It's during a party, in a conversation with a woman he and his colleagues have picked up at a convention. Much to Caul's anger, that conversation is recorded and played back to him by a colleague. Later that same night he sleeps with the woman, and she betrays him in a major way.\n\nThere's a twist in the plot which shows how the inflection we put into words can change their meaning dramatically. This is something which Harry Caul initially misses in his clinical analysis of his tapes.\n\nI saw \"The Conversation\" in a darkened theater in the company of 200 strangers. I assure you that there was not sound nor movement from any of us during the entire length of this film. The project is a riveting study of Caul's isolation from everyone- and also of how even our most private conversations are open books to anyone who wants to take the time to listen to them. The film was released in 1974. You can imagine how much more sophisticated those listeners have become today.\nVisit us at http://www.what-to-see-next.com",

It's the American ideal that any person born, regardless of circumstances, is in control of their destiny, and that with hard work, guile and determination, can make something of himself. Whether that was ever the case is questionable, but it seems more than ever that the people in power are in control of way more than we could ever suppose, or would ever want to know.\n\nThis was a nice smaller-scale film that, incredulously, Coppola was able to dish up in a run that is one of the finest a director would ever have, up there with Hitchcock's in the late 50's-early 60's, and Melville a decade later. It's definitely excellent work by Hackman (along with his Popeye Doyle in the pair of great 'French Connection' movies), and is up there with the greatest dissertations ever about the double-edged sword of surveillance, namely De Palma's 'Blow Out' and Antonioni's 'Blow-Up'.\n\nAs a human being, I only wish this film wasn't as important as it is.",

            "content": "Spoilers present in this review...\n\nWe live in an age where personal technology has pretty much become something of a necessity in our lives. How do we know that no one is listening to our conversations or watching us while we are in our homes. Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation explores the culture and life of a man, Harry Caul, who works in 'surveillance'. This film was made between the Godfather films and released on 1974, the same year The Godfather II was released.\n\nHarry Caul is to do a voice recording job on a couple's conversation on Union Square and give the tapes to director, the man who hired him. There may be more to it than just a conversation and he becomes personally involved as he doesn't want something from the past repeat itself. The film also explores this man who, definitely is one of the best in the profession, have become so isolated and guarded. Caul is afraid that someone might be listening or watching him. A certain areas of the film, it also speaks about the technology and how something that may seem like a normal object may be bugged and recording/observing you. The topics of this film, I find very interesting as it relates to the technology that is currently used today and some of us are maybe too naive to think that someone might actually be listening. Coppola has made a wonderful script and using a protagonist who has been mentally and emotionally damaged by his own work.\n\nNot a bad year for Francis Ford Coppola. Two films released in one year and both were nominated for Best Picture and one won the Palme d'Or at Cannes; one is very personal and indie, and the other is a big sequel to the best film of the 1970's. The Conversation was clearly something that he always wanted to make but the studios don't think it would be any good or they think he is not good enough of a director, so he made The Godfather and that made them think twice. The Godfather felt very grand, and Coppola wanted to make this film more subtle and quiet. This film is definitely slow when comparing to Coppola's other works but it works well with the subject and story that the film explores. In my first viewing, this was not something I loved and if i reviewed it then, it would have been a 3.5/5, but after a few months I watched it again and the film felt different, there was so much more to it than I thought there was. This film is so enjoyable and the last half hour is so frightening, in a subtle way, that it would be in your minds a few hours after the film is finished.\n\nCoppola wanted the photography to be very simple but it's simplicity is effective. The film's opening has a great shot that starts at a height and slowly gets closer and closer to the important characters, and the film ends with a slow panning shot as Hackman sits in the corner playing the saxophone. The photography doesn't try too hard to show off something and this is because it is not needed. I like that this film does not try to show off like The Godfather or be heavy like Apocalypse Now.\n\nThe score of the film, by David Shire, is also very stripped and simple. The score is driven by the piano and at times is supported by a saxophone. It is so stripped down that sometimes you may not even notice it's playing in a scene. There is a particular moment at the hotel where something happens and this static noise that adds to the imagery makes that scene so frightening.\n\nGene Hackman is incredible in this film, his portrayal of this closed off character was great. He is the main focus of the film and the supporting cast doesn't seem to out play him. Coppola wants the film to follow Caul as he listens to the tapes and uncovers things. The film overall has a great cast, it has actors like Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall, John Cazele and Cindy Williams. Cindy Williams, I was surprised broke off my impression of her from when I saw her at American Graffiti. Nevertheless this is a Hackman show and he delivers, this is possibly his best role.\n\nMany may not regard this as Coppola's masterpiece but it is a well made film about paranoia and the advancement of spyware technology. I felt this is one of his strongest films and just edges out The Godfather by a little. It is definitely one of the strongest films of the 1970's and should not be missed.",

His character comes further into focus as we see how his guilt and obsession over his work makes intimate relationships, and even casual acquaintanceships like that between a landlord and a tenant, virtually impossible. Caul's personality is not conveyed in not the most subtle or original ways: a trip to a confessional booth is involved, and tossed-off memories of childhood traumas, both of which are overfamiliar, quick and dirty methods for getting to the bottom of a character's psyche. But in spy dramas stock characters have a long and fine history, and the real stars are often plot and atmosphere. The problems with \"The Conversation\" really begin, then, when Caul is built up as an expert in the field, but proves less savvy than the audience despite having access to the same information. No George Smiley is he; although he, like Smiley, is well-respected in his field, and though both characters have blind spots in their personal lives, Caul exhibits a very un-Smiley-like fecklessness in virtually everything he does.  The plot twists remarkably little and elevates to disappointingly low stakes, yet Caul consistently proves to be no match for the crime thriller playbook's oldest tricks. Admittedly, that's part of the idea: he's become so damaged by his work that he's falling apart, but because the movie only spans the final stage of what must have been a long descent, Caul is remote and the story seems incomplete.  The climactic scenes seem to belong to a different movie entirely, one chiefly concerned with psychology and the reliability of perception, and while this turn may deflect attention from a relatively weak story, it again highlights the flimsiness of the central character and how little there is to know about him. By contrast, other Coppola movies from the same decade, namely The Godfather films and Apocalypse Now, benefit from richly detailed scripts and powerful personalities. Coppola's directorial style is also weaker in this film than in the others, as for example in the almost embarrassing reliance on horror-movie techniques in a key scene in a bathroom.",

            "content": "Spoilers present in this review...\n\nWe live in an age where personal technology has pretty much become something of a necessity in our lives. How do we know that no one is listening to our conversations or watching us while we are in our homes. Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation explores the culture and life of a man, Harry Caul, who works in 'surveillance'. This film was made between the Godfather films and released on 1974, the same year The Godfather II was released.\n\nHarry Caul is to do a voice recording job on a couple's conversation on Union Square and give the tapes to director, the man who hired him. There may be more to it than just a conversation and he becomes personally involved as he doesn't want something from the past repeat itself. The film also explores this man who, definitely is one of the best in the profession, have become so isolated and guarded. Caul is afraid that someone might be listening or watching him. A certain areas of the film, it also speaks about the technology and how something that may seem like a normal object may be bugged and recording/observing you. The topics of this film, I find very interesting as it relates to the technology that is currently used today and some of us are maybe too naive to think that someone might actually be listening. Coppola has made a wonderful script and using a protagonist who has been mentally and emotionally damaged by his own work.\n\nNot a bad year for Francis Ford Coppola. Two films released in one year and both were nominated for Best Picture and one won the Palme d'Or at Cannes; one is very personal and indie, and the other is a big sequel to the best film of the 1970's. The Conversation was clearly something that he always wanted to make but the studios don't think it would be any good or they think he is not good enough of a director, so he made The Godfather and that made them think twice. The Godfather felt very grand, and Coppola wanted to make this film more subtle and quiet. This film is definitely slow when comparing to Coppola's other works but it works well with the subject and story that the film explores. In my first viewing, this was not something I loved and if i reviewed it then, it would have been a 3.5/5, but after a few months I watched it again and the film felt different, there was so much more to it than I thought there was. This film is so enjoyable and the last half hour is so frightening, in a subtle way, that it would be in your minds a few hours after the film is finished.\n\nCoppola wanted the photography to be very simple but it's simplicity is effective. The film's opening has a great shot that starts at a height and slowly gets closer and closer to the important characters, and the film ends with a slow panning shot as Hackman sits in the corner playing the saxophone. The photography doesn't try too hard to show off something and this is because it is not needed. I like that this film does not try to show off like The Godfather or be heavy like Apocalypse Now.\n\nThe score of the film, by David Shire, is also very stripped and simple. The score is driven by the piano and at times is supported by a saxophone. It is so stripped down that sometimes you may not even notice it's playing in a scene. There is a particular moment at the hotel where something happens and this static noise that adds to the imagery makes that scene so frightening.\n\nGene Hackman is incredible in this film, his portrayal of this closed off character was great. He is the main focus of the film and the supporting cast doesn't seem to out play him. Coppola wants the film to follow Caul as he listens to the tapes and uncovers things. The film overall has a great cast, it has actors like Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall, John Cazele and Cindy Williams. Cindy Williams, I was surprised broke off my impression of her from when I saw her at American Graffiti. Nevertheless this is a Hackman show and he delivers, this is possibly his best role.\n\nMany may not regard this as Coppola's masterpiece but it is a well made film about paranoia and the advancement of spyware technology. I felt this is one of his strongest films and just edges out The Godfather by a little. It is definitely one of the strongest films of the 1970's and should not be missed.",

There's a plot that I don't need to describe - as it should be witnessed on its own - but truly the focus is on how the damaged Harry *interprets* what's happening, rather than what actually is, because the audience get very little in the way of an omniscient perspective, rather, our understanding is filtered through the unreliable narrator and protagonist.

It can also seem strange and have its points questioned due to the various subjects it uses to characterise Gene Hackman's character.\nNevertheless, The Conversation was a good film. \nThe chilling atmosphere was great and kept things monotonous, much like the mindset of Gene Hackman's character which ensured a simple but chilling atmosphere which is great because it never becomes excessively convoluted with confusion due to a good simplicity.\nAlso, The Conversation is extremely well written and directed from Francis Ford Coppola in one of his simpler ventures which makes the viewer fascinated and charmed by the quirks of the story, as well as the momentous realisations which result in stunning film intensity and has the audience fascinated and charmed all over again. \nGene Hackman also provides a great role in the lead creating the ideal psychological thriller mindset of a character living in an existence of paranoia for the viewer to ponder about while they understand him no better than he can understand himself. Gene Hackman conveys a truly disturbed character without it being excessive or unrealistic and so what he provides is a sense of realism to the film through a paranoid character which comes out finely. John Cazale, Robert Duvall and a young Harrison Ford were also all very good.\nAlso, The Conversation has valid points that are told cleverly in its story and is likely to have had a valid influence on the terrific Tony Scott film Enemy of the State.\nSo all in all, The Conversation is a fine quirky film from Francis Ford Coppola which serves as one of his better small scale films.",

It won't be for everyone but if you like a film worth analysing and certainly worth re-watching then this is for you. If you're familiar with the majority of Coppola's work then you'll know how much importance he places on finding that individuality within a film- that strangely familiar yet wholly original style that elevates his work beyond the script and into a concrete piece of art. Coppola works best for me when the style he is going for is a dark and haunting one and this is a perfect example of that. Its very calculated but not to the extent of tediousness for me, in fact, I really liked some of the very simple but effective moments in this one- I've never been a Hackman fan but this really brought something out from him that I could understand. There's a general charm to this one that's surely unintentional but it aids the film regardless- it just feels like the 70s and it's a great gem that's been pushed aside due to the Godfather and Apocalypse Now but this one is just as good in many regards. It's got one hell of a soundtrack too- it's rare that after my first watch of a film the main theme stays in my head but its always a good sign when it happens.\n\nIt's still too slow though, there's no way around it- it just steps too quietly at times and when so much is being conveyed, it's a little frustrating to feel like something is being held back. It's not anywhere near enough to break this one though. I give it 90% but only just- the, in my view, brilliant ending pushed it up from the high 80s. Maybe it didn't fully earn that but this film makes me think of OK Computer and I love Radiohead so it stays at 90%! (don't judge me)",

            "content": "The 1970s was the decade in which Francis Ford Coppola could not fail. The Godfather and its sequel both won him Best Picture at the Oscars, and at the end of the decade he pulled Apocalypse Now out of the mire and made it a masterpiece. Nestled in between these films is The Conversation, nominated for Best Picture alongside The Godfather Part II but somewhat overlooked ever since. While it might not quite meet their epic standards or match their lofty ambitions, it remains a haunting character study and a great, slow-burning psychological thriller.\n\nWhat marks The Conversation out from Coppola's other words of the period, and from its other contemporaries, is its understatement. Everything about the film is methodical and reserved: the way it is assembled, and shot, and edited, every aspect coils neatly around the central narrative like a tightly-wound spool of tape. All of the main performers are dialling down, resisting any urge to raise their voice or give a bigger reaction than the slightest twitch or glance. Even John Cazale, the loose cannon in Godfather II, holds back from letting off any steam.\n\nThe film is first and foremost Gene Hackman's piece. He is brilliant in the central role, a complete contrast from his commanding performance as Popeye Doyle three years earlier. He shrinks into the role just as Russell Crowe does in Michael Mann's The Insider, hiding behind the glasses like they were blinds on a window, and wearing the mac like a suit of armour. \n\nHackman's genius with the character lies in how he makes him seem completely natural. Harry Caul is a man who rarely lets his guard down, taking extensive precautions over every part of his life. The obvious trap for any actor to fall into is to play every such precaution as a conscious thought; this would result in the performance becoming that of an actor thinking about what to do, and it would quickly become jarring. Hackman, on the other hand, allows Caul's obsessive nature to wash over him - he acts like he isn't aware of it, which in turn makes it natural for the character.\n\nThe Conversation is a film about loneliness and isolation, driven by a character that revels and specialises in both these things. Coppola explores the various conflicts in Caul between the need for intimacy and the opposing need to keep at arms' length to avoid giving anything away. This is explored on a personal level, in his relationship with his landlord; a business level, in his scenes with Harrison Ford; a sexual level, in his stunted love affair; and a religious level, in his Catholic faith and the moral implications of his work.\n\nThe film also explores how technology intrudes upon our lives and erodes whatever sense of self or personal space we have. It's easy to call it a conspiracy thriller, considering its historical placing around the Watergate scandal, but it's far more of a cautionary tale or moral parable. The society we live in may be more technologically advanced than Caul's, insofar as we have moved on from reel-to-reel tape recorders. But issues surrounding privacy and the manipulation of personal information are still very much at the forefront, making The Conversation feel more than a little prophetic.\n\nAnother big theme in The Conversation is paranoia, contrasting the personal paranoia of Caul with the corporate paranoia of his mysterious employers. Caul's conversations with his competitors are immensely terse and evasive: they all work in the same industry, but Caul won't reveal any of his secrets. We aren't sure whether Caul is being delusional as to their true motives, or whether there really is more to them than meets the eye. The moment where Caul finds out he has been bugged at the party is a crushing blow for him: it demonstrates how tragic a figure he is, afraid of everyone and everything, and even more afraid to show it.\n\nThe film reinforces its paranoid atmosphere through its visual choices. The majority of the scenes are in faceless office buildings or empty warehouses - places that are so functional and drab that the tiniest unusual sound or out-of-place detail can deeply unnerve us. Caul always has to go through other people to get what he wants, to the extent that we don't meet \"the Director\" until the final third of the film.\n\nIt could be argued that Coppola is using this set-up to make a point about the nature of filmmaking. Caul is the actor, who is desperate to give the best performance he can to preserve and further his reputation, and he doesn't take kindly to being lied to or not being paid in the proper manner. The Director is distant and bad-tempered, refusing to speak to the actor directly until the latter's persistence becomes unbearable. The film doesn't dwell on its self-reflexive aspect like Mulholland Drive or Berberian Sound Studio, but it's still an interesting way of looking at it.\n\nLike the medium itself, The Conversation is a film which follows and magnifies the tiniest details. Its story deals with a plot point that many faster-paced spy thrillers would handle inside of 20 minutes. Because we are not given any idea about the intentions of the Director, we are placed in Caul's position, obsessively scrolling back and forth through the tapes, locating and deciphering hidden meanings. What seems at the start like a normal, innocuous conversation becomes more loaded and ingrained with meaning, and the more we look and listen, the more threat comes out.\n\nOn top of its examination of paranoia, The Conversation also deals with the subject of voyeurism. Caul is a devout Catholic who fears eternal damnation and constantly wrestles over whether his occupation is ethical. He wonders whether his professional eavesdropping is helping people or leading to horrible deaths, remarking during the dream sequence: \"I don't fear death; I do fear murder\". The deaths of three previous clients haunt Harry: he cannot ever bring himself to absolve himself of what happened, let alone accept the Lord's forgiveness.\n\nAs before, what makes The Conversation interesting in this regard is its restraint. In Blue Velvet, David Lynch explored voyeurism through striking and surreal imagery, intending to pull the viewer straight into a nightmare, under the pretext that they couldn't and cannot look away. Coppola, on the other hand, is more immediately suggestive, surrounding the viewer with the slow-moving and mundane to make the murder all the more shocking.\n\nHaving built up a small cauldron of suspense, the ending of The Conversation is really quite beautiful. After being threatened over the phone by The Director's right-hand man, Caul suspects his apartment has been bugged and promptly tears it apart. When he finds nothing, he sits among the ruins and plays his saxophone, as the camera tracks back and forth and the credits roll. Caul resigns himself to his fate - having worked so hard to avoid detection, only to be bugged anyway, he decides that this is inevitable. Someone is always listening, and sometimes they won't want to hurt you, so the best thing to do is to carry out living and let things take their course.\n\nThe only real flaw with The Conversation is its dream sequence. Having worked so hard and held back for so long, the film shifts to a more Gothic sensibility and gives us a lot of disappointing, expository dialogue. Much like the dream sequence in Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound, it feels like it has been helmed by another director (and in Hitch's case it was - Salvador Dali supervised the whole thing). It doesn't completely derail the film, but it doesn't bring a great deal to the table either.\n\nThe Conversation is a great slow-burning thriller and one of the best films of Coppola's career. Its story may appear more simple and straightforward than either The Godfather or Apocalypse Now, but it still has a wealth of ideas to intrigue and unnerve the audience. Hackman's performance contains some of his very best work, and he is complimented wonderfully by John Cazale and a rare villainous turn from Harrison Ford. You'll certainly have a lot to talk about afterwards - just be careful where you choose to talk about it.",

Everyone was great as well, I heard this was made between Godfather 1 and 2 and it's cool to see the similar filming to those movies. I was expecting something like the Godfather but I didn't get that but I still got something great. The whole story is very creative and cool, I even liked the ending a lot. It seemed to move pretty fast as well just like the Godfather. Coppola knows how to make movies go pretty fast and not drag as much. Even some scenes can drag a bit they usually are over before you know it. It's really cool to see some of the things this movie did with sound that are reused today. It was a pretty entertaining thriller and anyone that is a fan of The Godfather are sure to enjoy this.",

            "content": "With the help of his keen and intellectual direction that has made him so famous, Francis Ford Coppola successfully strikes gold with \"The Conversation,\" a film that haunts you with its wonderfully visceral claustrophobic tension that grabs hold of you and doesn't let go. Gene Hackman's iconic performance further immerses the audience in an untold world of anti-secrecy and the ultimate breach of privacy. The major artistic imagery and meaning that the film produces isn't just fantastic but groundbreaking. Coppola's work of genius didn't just set the stage for mysteries to come; it redefined the genre completely.\n\nHackman plays a surveillance expert who is hired to track a young couple to understand exactly what they are discussing and doing. Over time, he uncovers information that he wasn't supposed to discover. Harry (Hackman) has to attempt to not get involved with the things that he is witnessing, while successfully keeping his life in check. While breaching the lives and privacy of others, he creates a vulnerable spot in his own world, and he must stop it from being destroyed. Coppola's brilliantly crafted screenplay made for a brilliant film indeed. \n\nThe performances are astounding. Not only does Gene Hackman give one of the best performances of his career, but the supporting actors that include John Cazale are all flawless as well. Even a young Harrison Ford makes a few well done appearances throughout the picture. The film throws all the non-believable gimmicks out the window and leaves the audience with simple human consciousness, resulting in a suspenseful environment that doesn't let up. As the characters experience well placed exposition, the audience collectively tightens its grip and finds itself truly believing how possible the content of the film really is. \n\nThe well done cinematography also helps the film to be as great as it is. The picture begins with a birds eye angle that slowly creeps in to a two-shot. Its actually a recurring example of fantastic cinematography that you'll usually find yourself seeing in some film classes. It's a classic sequence that should never go unnoticed. The rest of the film's visuals are just as good. Most of the fantastic visuals are of Hackman's emotions being conveyed on screen. His slow decay into madness is depicted perfectly through the lens of the camera. \n\nBetween \"The Godfather\" and \"The Godfather Part II,\" Francis Ford Coppola successfully made a work of art. And though it might go unnoticed when discussing the consecutive production of the two classics that have made him iconic, \"The Conversation\" is itself a classic. Its firm grip on the genre of mystery sets a standard that to this day is still difficult to match.",

While most would point to the Godfather series as being the pinnacle of his creative endeavors, I would at least like to present exhibit B-The Conversation.\n \nAlthough not as epic in scope or as poignant as the first two Godfather films, The Conversation is a quiet, powerful look at the paranoid American. As civilization \"progresses\" and technology improves by leaps and bounds every year, we as a people discover more ways to not only loosen our ties that bind humanity together, but we also become more adept at keeping tabs on our opponents.\n \nHarry Caul could even be seen as the everyday American in 2012. Technology allows him to be well-versed in the lives of others, but at the end of the day, seldom is known about what makes him tick. He is a shrewd surveillance expert. His hands are not drenched in the blood of others. Yet, his work offers such intrusion into the lives of others, that deep down he knows he is in some ways culpable for the crimes committed because of his life's work.\n \nWhat starts as just a well-crafted thriller, evolves into a psychological thriller about the conscience of a man who is so immersed in the minds of his fellow man, that he hasn't yet fully figured out his own.\n \nThese themes are augmented by David Shire's entrancing piano score. It slowly builds tension and really adds to the mental terror experienced by the protagonist. I was really impressed by Hackman's performance as well. Delivering a performance as layered as an onion, and from what I understand, something very different from Hackman's real life personality.\n \nMaybe I was just starved for something meaty to chew on.

It's paranoid musings on the surveillance age certainly haven't become any less unsettling, and Gene Hackman's conscious plagued character (perhaps the actor's very best performance) really speaks to future generations that lost their privacy.

Harry Caul è un investigatore privato, esperto di sorveglianza ed intercettazioni, che nutre un'ossessione paranoica per la propria privacy. Il suo appartamento è quasi totalmente spoglio e la porta ha una tripla serratura, egli usa telefoni pubblici e finge di non avere un numero telefonico privato. Il suo laboratorio è ricavato in uno spazio delimitato da un reticolato all'interno di un capannone. Estremamente professionale, ma con evidenti problemi nelle relazioni interpersonali, cerca di evitare il più possibile ogni tipo di coinvolgimento emotivo, sia con il proprio collaboratore Stan, che con i soggetti dei casi che tratta. Il suo disagio è evidente quando si trova in luoghi affollati, tanto da indossare costantemente, quando esce, un soprabito di plastica trasparente. Il suo solo svago è la passione per il sassofono, che coltiva in privato suonandolo con sottofondo di musica da dischi di jazz.\n\nCaul riceve dal direttore generale di una grande azienda, nominato sempre nel film come \"Il direttore\", l'incarico d'intercettare la conversazione di una coppia che si muove in una piazza affollata, la Union Square di San Francisco, ed anche di scattare loro alcune fotografie. Si tratta di un'intercettazione tecnicamente molto difficile, che però egli riesce ad espletare egregiamente. Nonostante che la sua deontologia professionale, esplicitamente dichiarata, preveda l'esecuzione delle migliori intercettazioni possibili, ma il totale disinteresse per il loro contenuto e le vicende ad esso collegate e riguardanti committente ed intercettati, Caul rimane coinvolto dal contesto in cui si svolge l'intercettazione, che non riesce a comprendere completamente. La ripetizione continua ed ossessiva della conversazione intercettata, prima vaga ed indistinta, poi via via sempre più precisa e definita, porta il protagonista a trovarsi emotivamente sempre più coinvolto nelle vicende della coppia e del committente della registrazione.\n\nCaul comincia però ad essere roso da un senso di colpa (derivante anche da una tragica esperienza vissuta in precedenza e dalla propria devozione alla religione cattolica) e diventa riluttante a consegnare i nastri al committente. Quando infine riesce a decifrare una frase, fino ad allora risultata incomprensibile «Ci ammazza, se gliene diamo l'occasione», decide di non consegnare i nastri. La registrazione gli viene però rubata, su commissione del committente stesso, che ne entra quindi ugualmente in possesso. Caul cerca d'impedire quella che egli crede che sarà l'inevitabile tragedia finale, ma scoprirà che l'epilogo non è quello che ha immaginato.\n\nNel finale del film una telefonata induce Caul a credere che il suo appartamento sia stato violato e messo sotto controllo; cerca così di scoprire l'eventuale cimice e per questo finisce con lo smantellarlo pezzo per pezzo, ma senza ottenere alcun risultato. La famosa, ultima sequenza del film, riprende Caul che suona il sassofono nell'appartamento, ormai devastato da lui stesso nell'ossessiva ricerca della \"cimice\", con una panoramica dall'alto, come se si trattasse di una telecamera di sorveglianza.\n[it.wikipedia.org]",

Certes, le personnage d'Harry Caul demeure tout de même intéressant, même si Coppola aurait pu le développer davantage, mais le scénario m'apparaît un peu faible, sauvé par un dénouement qui nous surprend tout de même, mais pas assez pour sauver tout le reste. Personnellement, même si j'ai souvent baillé, la scène finale m'a réellement touché.\n\nApocalypse Now demeure donc mon film préféré de Coppola, et de loin, puisque la trilogie du Parrain m'a sincèrement ennuyé.

It's also a film he wasn't heavily involved in writing, but he's so hands on with every facet of the production, including the actors and the dialogue that they say, that it's very much his film. Gene Hackman's performance also deserves mention because it's fantastic, and this is a side of Hackman we rarely see, which is a vulernable human being. He's so paranoid by everyone around him that the only way he can talk about himself personally is in his dreams, and when he does relent, he's ridiculed slightly for it. The piano score from David Shire is also fantastic, a score which was a kind of rarity (still is). The film is expertly paced to draw you in, taking a bit of inspiration from Blow-Up, but it's also one of the edgiest films in the thriller genre. It's not quite a thriller per se, but that's about as close to a genre as it gets. It was released the same year as The Godfather Part II as well, both of which swept up nominations at the Oscars. I can't imagine any other filmmaker being in that kind of position and still coming out on top.",
