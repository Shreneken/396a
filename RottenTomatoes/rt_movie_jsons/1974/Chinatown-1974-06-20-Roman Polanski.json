Jake's investigation soon becomes anything but routine when he meets the real Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) and realizes he was hired by an imposter. Mr. Mulwray's sudden death sets Gittes on a tangled trail of corruption, deceit and sinister family secrets as Evelyn's father (John Huston) becomes a suspect in the case.",

Jack Nicholson's iconic 20s gumshoe detective, Faye Dunaway's masterful performance, and the scene-stealing John Huston provide Robert Towne's brilliantly original screenplay to life. This New Hollywood wave-film exceeds all expectations, capturing the audience's attention and effectively controlling a grim plot.",

            "content": "\"Chinatown\" is ranked at #21 in AFI's Top 100 Films of all time list and is a dark and gritty noir film that is Roman Polanski's most critically acclaimed film to date as well as an all around great film!  The direction by Polanski is phenomenal and the Mise en scene is truly gorgeous just as much as it's representative of the dark and trying issues involved within the context of the film.  It's a critique of both capitalism and bureaucratic systems all wrapped up in a more cynical film-noir.  Jack Nicholson gives a great performance as a cop-turned-private eye trying to unravel the mystery of a murder involving one of his clients.  As the film proceeds, at a very specific and slow-burning pace, we start to see that there is a huge story that goes along with the characters in question.  The film is truly a masterpiece and the very realistic and depressing ending is truly a revelation in an industry obsessed with happy endings and the characters all living happily ever after.  If you are looking for that type of film make sure to stay far away from \"Chinatown\".  If, however, you are looking for an amazing and wonderfully cinematic mystery/suspense film that is reminiscent of the great film-noirs of the 40s and 50s then be sure to give this amazing and thought-provoking movie a chance!",

It isn't a whodunit or a \"fish out of water\" story, but one of those stories where a skilled protag continues to scratch beneath the surface until he's standing six feet underground looking up. Contemporaneously with Jake (Jack Nicholson), the viewer puts the pieces together, which allows them to draw their own conclusions until a new piece of evidence of context subverts those very conclusions. Water Rights are one of those nuclei that a movie made in 2021 likely wouldn't center its conflict, but in a place like Southern California, they are literally the difference between life and death. You'd think Jake, a P.I., would've called it quits after he famously gets his nostril ripped open with \"Man with Knife's\" (Roman Polanski) knife. Instead, Jake continues to dig and we love him even more for it. The dialogue is expectantly great, especially between Jake and Evelyn (Faye Dunaway). I always knew the \"My sister! My daughter!\" line, I just never knew exactly what it meant… ugh. The ending is a gut-punch cherry-topped with a classic Hollywood line. Come for the fashion and cars, stay for Dunaway's razor-sharp eyebrows.",

It is a wonderful movie, as well as an affectionate and inspired homage to film noir, with a lot to love about it.\n\nRoman Polanski's direction is superb. He always directs with such precision in this movie and it shows loud and clear.\n\n\nThe production values are terrific. Chinatown does look ravishing, the costumes, detail, scenery and cinematography are all exemplary.\n\n\nI am a big Jerry Goldsmith fan, since seeing The Wind and the Lion and hearing his amazing score for that. His music score up here is up there with his best, it doesn't feel hackneyed or generic in any way, it really shows a master at work.\n\n\nThe script is brilliantly organised. In fact along with Casablanca, Shawshank Redemption and All About Eve I think Chinatown has one of the best screenplays ever written.\n\n\nThe story is never less than compelling. It is a wonderful story thet has just the right amount of intensity without being too convoluted and paced really well.\n\n\nThe acting I also can't fault. Jack Nicholson gives one of his best performances and he is terrifically supported by a ravishingly beautiful Faye Dunnaway and a truly terrific John Huston.\n\n\nOverall, a wonderful movie and one of the best of the 70s. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Roman Polanski's \"Chinatown\" is an old-fashioned, gripping and suspenseful film-noir proving Ma-Nicholson detectives deserve to solve murder mysteries of environmental degradation in Chinatown cities. With Oscar-winning noir, Polanski crafts mesmerizing murder mystery standing tests of time as a classic. Using captivating cinematography, Polanski immerses viewers in a hard-boiled detective's journey cleaning up crimes on seedy underbellies of Chinatown city. Emulating Alfred Hitchcock's \"Vertigo\", Polanski effectively uses Vertigo-inducing visuals drawing Hitchcock-sure detective's journey in criminal cities. Like James Stewart's obsessions with finding his past lover in city corruption, Jack Nicholson becomes determined to resolve affairs at any cost. Recalling Gotham City's seedy underbelly driving Batman towards sanity, the city of Chinatown pushes Gittes to limit. Robert Towne's screenplay is also sensational, creating authentic portraits of crime-riddled cities through non-linear storytelling. One must appreciate astonishing performances. Jack Nicholson delivers one of his greatest career performances as Detective Gittes. With riveting expressions, he conveys angst, desperation and resentments of hard-boiled sleuth determined to solve murder mystery in crime-riddled city by any means necessary. Faye Dunaway is fantastic in the role of a femme fatale seeking vengeance against corrupt institutions for husband's assassinations. Faye conveys complex emotions of a grieving woman through revealing expression making without single utterance.  Although \"Chinatown\" is undeniably unforgettable crime classics, ultimately it isn't flawless. Like methodical detectives taking time to solve crimes, it's a slow-paced film taking substantial time to unfold. The film's emphasis on dialogue rather than action may not please modern audiences with low-attention spans. Nevertheless, fans of murder mysteries will definitely enjoy \"Chinatown\" and so will movie-goers seeking suspenseful entertainment. If Sherlockian sleuths surviving Reichenbach Fall tragedies were asked to solve murder mysteries why film noirs have fallen out of fashion in 21st Century, they would advise Hollywood to give genre second shot at avoiding Usual Suspects suspicion despite 12 Angry Men juries arguing Zodiac serial killers that once captured public's imagination by stunning Fostering police-officer into Silence of the Lambs submission In the Heat of the Night are no longer pursued by L.A. Confidential police divisions whose detailed Memories of Murders need Memento photos reminding forgetful police authorities on crimes committed in Chinatown during bygone generation.",

And that finale is probably the greatest instance of a film tying a great big bow around its narrative. So many others fall flat as they inch toward an anticlimactic, unsatisfactory ending.

            "content": "Chinatown, a crime solving 1974 neo-noir style movie with a plot centered around a murder investigation, stars Jack Nicholson at the peak of his career. From a first-person point of view, following Nicholson's character J.J. \"Jake\" Gittes, the movie gives the audience an inside look at what it might be like to be a Los Angeles private investigator in 1937. Writer, Robert Towne, originally intended for Chinatown to launch a trilogy of movies featuring Gittes, but a direct sequel would not be released until 16 years later with little commercial success. Towne originally was asked by producer Robert Evans to create a screenplay for F. Scott Fitzgerald's book The Great Gatsby however Towne felt that he could not do justice for Fitzgerald's works. Instead, we end up with a dark rich movie directed by Roman Polanski that is a tribute to the classic movies of the past. With great ease, Chinatown gives the audience an ambience and imagery that heightens their senses and keeps an enigma alive from beginning to end.\n​When the opening credits begin rolling for Chinatown, the audience is greeted by a classic trumpet solo synonymous with a film noir murder mystery, along with a haunting violin expressing that there is something dark and sinister happening. Also, Polanski wants his viewers to know that it is indeed 1937 by giving them images of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the opening courtroom scene, as well as, Seabiscuit being prominent in the newspaper. Throughout the film, shadows are elegantly used to focus on the eyes of characters during night scenes giving a look into what Gittes might be seeing as he attempts to unravel the mystery surrounding the murder of businessman Hollis Mulwray. In addition, the sounds of the film play out the underlying theme of the movie with water being a key component to the plot. For example, during the scene that shows the body of call girl, Ida Sessions, found in her home there is a slow drip of water from the faucet to remind the audience the underlying plot of the film. Almost every main scene in the movie features a shower, a pool, a pond, or a puddle to drive the point home that water is key to Gittes solving the crime.\n​Keeping the enigma alive throughout the film, Towne's script takes the audience on a journey the begins with a simple investigation of an affair turning into corruption that goes beyond anything imaginable. Also starring Faye Dunaway (Evelyn Cross Mulwray), her character is constantly changing the story she is telling Jack Nicholson (Gittes) throughout the film. Although the mystery of her situation seems sinister, in the end, it is a much darker web of truth than Gittes wants to be involved with. Moreover, the rollercoaster of emotions that the audience is taken on leaves them guessing until the very end exactly what is going on. Chinatown is a great example of a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat and trying to put the pieces together and why Towne's won the best original screenplay award at the 1975 Academy Awards.\n​In the end, Chinatown is a movie that deserves the full attention of praise of its audience. The direction of Polanski in the film guides Nicolson and Dunaway on a journey unlike anything other. When the audience learns the truth of the film, they are sure to want more of this type of mystery and writing style from Towne. With its dark overtones and an ambiance that plays true homage to film noir classics like Sunset Boulevard, Chinatown delivers viewers on a sense bending journey from beginning to end. Connecting the dots and playing the game of the film's enigma will make the audience want to watch a second time through to see what clues they may have missed the first time around.",

            "content": "Produced during a time when revisionist films were en vogue, reworking familiar Hollywood genre pictures, westerns, gangster films, love stories, and here detective films, Roman Polanski and Robert Towne's \"Chinatown\" is a masterpiece of cinema that dissects not just the detective film but dissects America itself. Jack Nicholson plays private detective J.J. Gittes. When mysterious woman enters his office one day to hire him to look into a suspected affair by her husband, this small case, in classic Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett style, leads to a Byzantine mystery of murder, sex, money, power, and intrigue. Although this sounds familiar, this is a very different world from that of Chandler or Hammett. Gittes is not Phillip Marlowe or Sam Spade. He runs a successful P.I. business. Gittes himself is also the type of guy who will manically giggle at his own dirty jokes (can't picture Humphrey Bogart doing that). And befitting of 1970s cynicism, it's a story of the little guy facing down larger powers, though in this revisionist (i.e. more realistic) of world, the good guys don't always win and Mr. Smith does not always change Washington. However, as with most revisionist films, while the filmmakers spend a good deal of time deliberately blowing up genre tropes, they in equal part pay loving homage to those same tropes. \"Chinatown\" features some of the most sharpest hard boiled detective dialog ever committed to screen, there is gorgeous Hollywood style photography from cinematographer John A. Alonzo, and one of the most lush film scores to ever grace the screen from composer Jerry Goldsmith (Arguably his best score and composed in only 10 days after the original score was rejected. David Lynch says it's his all-time favorite film score.). The story even unfolds in a manner true to Chandler detective story traditions, with the entire film told from the perspective of the main character, Jake Gittes. Towne's script is a thing of beauty. The story and mystery progress with natural logic and makes perfect sense when it reaches its conclusion. Watching the film a second time, you can go back and see that all the pieces of the puzzle were right there in front of you from the beginning. All the clues to the mystery were there in plain sight. All the seemingly unimportant lines and character responses you interpreted to mean one thing now take on much different and deeper meanings. The script for \"Chinatown\" is a master class in storytelling. Beyond plot and story, Towne delivers, in true hard boiled detective fiction fashion, some of the most crackling dialogue you'll ever hear, and dialogue delivered by some of the greatest of Hollywood actors:\n\nEvelyn Mulwray: Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.\nJake Gittes: Well, I've been accused of a lot of things before, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.\n\nor\n\nJake Gittes: Maid's night off?\nEvelyn Mulwray: Why?\nJake Gittes: What do you mean, why? Nobody's here, that's why.\nEvelyn Mulwray: I gave everyone the night off.\nJake Gittes: Easy. It's an innocent question.\nEvelyn Mulwray: No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.\n\nor\n\nNoah Cross: Exactly what do you know about me? Sit down.\nJake Gittes: Mainly that you're rich, too respectable to want your name in the newspapers.\nNoah Cross: Of course I'm respectable I'm old! Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores all get respectable if they last long enough.\n\nor\n\nMan with Knife: You're a very nosy fellow, kitty cat. Huh? You know what happens to nosy fellows? Huh? No? Wanna guess? Huh? No? Okay. They lose their noses. [slashes Jake's nose] Next time you lose the whole thing. Cut it off and feed it to my goldfish.\n\nor\n\nJake Gittes: But, Mrs. Mulwray, I goddamn near lost my nose. And I like it. I like breathing through it. And I still think you're hiding something.\n\nor\n\nJake Gittes: In Chinatown.\nEvelyn Mulwray: What were you doing there?\nJake Gittes: Working for the District Attorney.\nEvelyn Mulwray: Doing what?\nJake Gittes: As little as possible.\nEvelyn Mulwray: The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?\nJake Gittes: They do in Chinatown.\n\n\nThere's also a snappy bit when a hired thug asks Jake what happened to his nose, which Gittes' reply is a bit too crass to share here, but it's dynamite. And the casting of \"Chinatown\" is perfect! The part of Jake Gittes was written for Nicholson and he is spot on! Faye Dunaway gives what I would argue is her strongest and most complex of performance. John Huston has his most menacing of role as the powerful Noah Cross, while oozing his John Huston charm to disarm those around him. Supporting players are just as strong, including Perry Lopez, John Hillerman, Diane Ladd (mother of Laura Dern), Bruce Glover (father of Crispin Glover), James Hong, Noble Willingham, Rance Howard (father of Ron Howard), and Burt Young. It's a perfectly cast film to tell this story. Besides script and cast, the contributions by Polanski cannot be understated. Polanski forced Towne, against his wishes, to change the ending of the film to a much darker and cynical of one, which was more in line with Polanski's current world view following the horrific murder of his wife just a few years earlier. Besides the cynicism Polanski brought to the film, he also brought an outsiders sensibility to this most American of genres. It's a European's take on a very American type of picture and story. \"Chinatown\" has an elegance to it that was rarely present in most noir or detective pictures. \"Chinatown\" is west coast noir in vivic color, showing a world of dry river beds, sweaty brows under fedoras, and a parched 1930s Los Angeles. While this could have been a stark raw presentation, Polanski films the story with the same elegant camera moments he brought to \"Rosemary's Baby\" or even his earlier films, like \"Knife in the Water,\" as well as bring lush vivid tones that pop off of the screen in true old school Hollywood fashion. This brings me to the production design work by Richard Sylbert (\"The Manchurian Candidate\" \"The Graduate\" \"Rosemary's Baby\" \"Carlito's Way\"), who I'd argue is the finest production designed to have ever worked in film. Sylbert brings not just authenticity to the time and place, he brings a color palette of browns and yellows that emphasize the dry barren setting, complimenting the themes of the story, bringing both realism and beauty to the picture. Overall, \"Chinatown\" stands as a masterpiece of cinema and among the finest films every made. The talent in front of and behind the camera were at the peak of their talents and all the pieces landed perfectly into place. This was the final film that Polanski made in the United States before fleeing to France to avoid statutory rape charges and I would argue none of his subsequent films ever reached this pinnacle. The same could be said for the other talent involved, who have all made many fine subsequent films, but \"Chinatown\" stands out as unique and as one of greatest films ever grace world cinema. FUN FACT! Jane Fonda turned down the role of Evelyn Mulwray. BONUS FUN FACT! Polanski was hired after Peter Bogdanovich turned down the film, which he later said he regretted.",

            "content": "*SPOILERS AHEAD*\nThe Film, Chinatown, starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, is a fantastic and stellar film, but it isn't without its problems. \nMany of the camera angles had the actor not even facing the camera giving his or her lines, when seeing his or her face would have been an amazing shot. For example, when Gittes is on the grass waiting to talk to Mrs. Mulwray, when Gittes is racing through the orange groves in his car, and at the morgue when they all had their backs to the camera, while the mortician was getting out another body. Almost all shots inside cars made no sense at all. It doesn't give a good angle and shot for the audience when you are in the back of a car and don't even cut to the outside of the car. It made no sense to me.\nJack Nicholson in the film has amazing acting skills and really makes his character come to life. He shows the wit and cleverness of J.J. Gittes. For example, when Gittes took many business cards then pretended to be Yelburton, but Nicholson appearance is something I had trouble placing. To me, he looked like a serial killer ready to kill on the spot.\nThe wardrobe and makeup department had its ups and downs. The fashion throughout the film was amazing and on-point for the time, but when Gittes and Evelyn were at dinner, the cut of her hair and shadows made her look like a skull with very sullen cheeks. Also Evelyn's eyebrows made her look very much older than she was. Katherine, her daughter, is about 15-18, which would make Evelyn 30-32. \n\tA very big problem for the problem with this film is Gittes's bandage over his nose for half the film. It was very distracting in lots of moments and I kept noticing it in the film. I kept thinking it would have looked better and more dark, fitting the noir film, if we saw a scar or the wound not in a bandage, which did occur at the end of the film, but it was very distracting until it came off.\nA good thing the wardrobe department did was make Ida Sessions look cheap when she was impersonating Evelyn. Gittes even said she looked cheap and I agree. Sessions looked like she was trying to be rich in a very, very cheap budget. \nMany acting moments could have been improved upon as well. When Evelyn and Gittes were at the nursing home and they meet the man as they walk out he keeps holding onto his suit jacket. I knew instantly he had a gun on him. A big moment is at the very beginning of the film with one of Gittes's clinets crying and looking detergent. He was over-acting way to much and it made it really inauthentic. Same goes for Belinda Palmer's over-acting after Evelyn got shot at the end of the film. The big reveal of Katherine, who we didn't know was Katherine yet, as Evelyn's sister, was very anticlimactic the first time. Dunaway threw away the line and made it sound like she was telling a joke. \nThe film had many good parts, specifically the plot. The story is very well written and very suspenseful. It's a wonderful noir film. The ending was spectacular and very different from what you think might happen. Evelyn dies, Cross gets away with urder and Katherine, and Gittes is left with nothing. It is not how you think it would be and that made it even better. The storyline was confusing at first, but then all the pieces added up together and you could understand what was going on. Evelyn being raped by her own father very much so added to the darkness of the film and really set Cross as the true villain of the film.\nAnother amazing part was after Gittes and Mulwray had sex. Director, Roman Polanski and writer, Robert Towne, had Evelyn not cover her breasts with a sheet, a classic hollywood move. It gave a real humanistic affect and authenticity to the film becuase after sex, does a women really cover her breasts with a sheet?\nThe lighting and music very much added to the suspense of the film and really helped keep me focused on the plot and what was going on in the scene. \nWhat I believe this film was trying to do was raise awareness to the government and normal citizens about corruption and exploitation, as this film was released two years after the Watergate scandal with Former President Nixon. The film achieved its goal as it centered around a private investigator who was investing the man in charge of the department of water in LA during a drought. It went into a explored how anyone can be bought and do things for their own benefit.\nThis film was certainly worth doing as it showed how not everyone gets a happy ending and not everything will turn out the way you hope. It gave an important message to the world on how the rich do have sway over many things and can get away with a lot more than the average person can. It is one of the reason's the film is titled Chinatown. Gittes lost a woman in Chinatown and couldn't do anything about it, that's why he quit being a cop. He lost another woman he loved, Evelyn, in Chinatown as well and she ended up dead, and Cross would walk free with everything. \nOverall the film has very good effects and I enjoyed watching it. I might not go straight to the film when I want to watch something, but I would watch this film again in the future.",

            "content": "Intriguing mystery full of dark conspiracy.\n\nRoman Polanski's neo-noir mystery Chinatown (1974) is a pessimistic look into the underbelly of high crimes in L.A. Polanski directs Chinatown with a gritty eye for the most seedy locations, haunting atmosphere, and suspenseful angles. You never know who will say what or when someone will appear. Chinatown is all about driving around L.A. looking for answers to questions interviewees don't want asked. Polanski is so bold in his vision, but also bold in his subject matter considering who he is as a person. I should warn viewers that Chinatown takes several turns into dark material that may sit ill with some viewers.\n\nJerry Goldsmith's score is unsettling with jangly sounds and eerie echoes scattered across the dismally dry terrain of L.A. in a drought. Robert Towne's script is cleverly written with tons of twists and reveals that will still shock you. He creates a seedy unforgiving world in Chinatown as Towne's bleak vision of L.A. is brutal. His lines are pithy, but also biting. John A. Alonzo's cinematography is a stark blend of neo-noir style with alluring rooms and striking notes with more contemporary naturally pretty scenery. His wide shots are the most interesting as anyone can pop out of them at anytime. Anthea Sylbert's costumes are gorgeous dresses and cool suits that are as iconic as the scenes they are in within Chinatown.\n\nJack Nicholson is riveting and entertaining as the lead actor playing a private detective named Jake Gittes. His sarcastic offhand manner is funny and his serious demeanor gives his rationale a believable intellect. Nicholson is as cool and calculating as he ever was in his career. Faye Dunaway is fascinating as the femme fatale Mrs. Evelyn Cross Mulwray. A curious portrayal that hints at her character's inner secrets. John Huston is so devilishly cruel here that I will not spoil a moment of his screen-time.\n\nChinatown also has several neat cameos from Diane Ladd, James Hong, Rance Howard, and even Roman Polanski himself. In all, Chinatown is a hazy crime thriller desperate for morality where there is none.",

            "content": "Were it not for all of the critical praise that this film had received I think I would have turned it off after the first twenty minutes. This is one of those slow burners, as so many film noirs are, in which none of the juicy details are revealed until the final act and the focus is more on capturing a tone and a mood than on plot and characterization. I can't say that I would call this one of the greatest films ever made, although I can see how you could make an argument for it, but I still found a lot to appreciate in it and even as I did not love the film I could stand back and admire it as a cinematic achievement.\n\nPrivate detective Jake Gittes, Jack Nicholson, primarily works on investigating the infidelity of wealthy men. He is hired by a woman posing as Evelyn Mulwray, Diane Ladd, the wife of Hollis Mulwray who works as the chief engineer for the Department of Water. After he discovers Hollis dead he begins to investigate further into the issue and realizes that the drought that had been occurring is driven by corporate greed. He teams up with the real Mulwray, Faye Dunaway, as he investigates the issue and discovers that the wealthy Noah Cross, John Huston, owns the department and intends to make the land infertile so he can purchase it cheaply and then sell it back to locals for inflated prices. Gittes and Mulwray begin an affair but Gittes is suspicious about a woman that Mulwray houses and he faces increasing threats from men tied to Cross. After a shocking revelation Gittes plans to have Mulwray and the mysterious young woman escape from the city but his efforts are sadly sabotaged.\n\nThe entire film is drenched in melancholy as the score from Jerry Goldsmith informs us immediately that this will be a story about desperate, emotionally repressed people who exist in a punishing world. Our protagonist is an arrogant man who believes himself to be two steps ahead of those around him but is too soft in reality to truly succeed. Mulwray in Gittes fall into a relationship, in classic film noir style, but even this plot point defies expectations as Gittes' attempts to use Mulwray to achieve some emotional catharsis are weak and pathetic, something she realizes. Of course the shocking twist concerning incest between Cross and Mulwray is as dark as any film noir gets but Polanski handles this in a sensitive fashion and we are devastated to see this brittle woman die. Our expectations are constantly confounded and despite the film's various plot points taking a long time to materialize they are satisfying.\n\nPolanski captures action in a way that feels realistic and honest as even the hyper stylized moments of violence, Gittes having his nose sliced open by Polanski in a cameo, never feel out of place with the harsh environment this film presents. The various beatings and attacks in this film culminate in the horrifying final scene in which Mulwray is shot through the head while attempting to escape. We see the gory bullet hole that has pierced through her eye for just a second but it is enough to affirm to us that the folksy but menacing Cross is pure evil. The sight of him lasciviously grabbing at his daughter/granddaughter increase our feeling of disgust and the hopelessness of Gittes in the final moments of the film as he has been allowed to go free but will have to carry the heavy burden of guilt with him for the rest of his life. Not to mention the fact that he is now aware of just how corrupt the society he occupies is and lives with the knowledge that he has no way to prevent this evil from spreading.\n\nNicholson gives one of his best performances as he allows himself to be completely emasculated while retaining the anger that made him so great in his early roles. He seems as though he is in transition at this point in his career as he moves from being the sad, brooding young man to the sad, resigned older man who tries to find solace in the wrong women. Huston gets a role worthy of his stature as his impressive presence is enough for us to be intimidated by him and Dunaway gives a pitch perfect impression of the classic femme fatale with a dash of 1970s cynicism. Across the board the performances are something to behold and it is hard to imagine other actors inhabiting these roles.",

It redefines the genre thriller with nothing but a single lose thread that keeps you on the hook throughout its more than two hours of journey. Unlike any other mystery drama, it follows a single track only, which has the potential to keep you tangled in this world of cheat and death. The weaving of the structure that builds up to a clue or newer perspective on the case, is how Polanski keeps the audience in awe of its sheer intensity. \n\nThe narration is not only gripping and adaptive but layered with thought provoking dialogues and pragmatic conversations along with raising sensitive issues. Nicholson's portrayal is smarter and mature than his usual acts are and the credit also goes to the writers that has allotted him a much wider range of persona that easily overpowers others. His hat, his suit, his notions of lighting a cigarette and arranging his hairs, he is calculating and observing on each steps. His methods are brimmed with such cunning intuitions that he fuels the entire feature that drives it into a whole new brighter town. \n\nSupporting him thoroughly, Dunaway is fishy enough to keep the uncertainty alive through the sincerity of her performance. Polanski keeps the jagged script on the edge throughout the course and it is that awareness of the hidden Trump card that makes you bleed and sweat.

To start things off the cast is fantastic in this movie, Jack Nicholson is magnificent especially his subtle acting, for example after Mrs. Mulwray saves him from being shot, the way he looks at her indicates its the first sign he is starting to fall in love her. There is also another scene in the movie where Jack shows brilliance in his subtle acting where he is checking up on Mrs. Mulwray because he feels something suspicious is going on, while he is driving just the look on his face shows that he is tired and he has been through a lot through out the day. Faye Dunaway is fantastic in this film as well and seeing her and Jack work together in this movie was amazing. Just like the acting the movie itself is also very subtle, the theme is not just straight up in your face it does require some thinking. This movie is also very good at foreshadowing for instance when Jake and Mrs. Mulwray are at the restaurant she says that she has had affairs but she would not call it cheating on her husband, that is indicating her father Noah Cross has raped her which is revealed later on in the movie. Noah Cross is a very disturbing villain the more I think about it because he is an old person who has raped his daughter and killed his son-in-law/former business partner and the actor who played him did a really good job. The movie is able to not feel messy even when a lot of things are going on and instead feels contained. The scene where he talks about his past in chinatown I felt like that could have been a movie by itself because in his past he talks about how he tries to protect this woman and later she dies, the same thing happens in the film where the woman who he is trying to protect dies and gets killed, he tries to do the right thing throughout the movie but in the end he is vulnerable and can't win and it was unavoidable and Jake is back to where he was before. The message of this movie is not a positive one but it is honest and it is great to sometimes see a movie that is not perfectly wrapped with a bow and everything is all good. Overall this movie is a must see and I will give this a definite 10 out of 10.",

But Jack Nicholson gives an excellent performance that likely thrust him into fully-fledged leading man status. Faye Dunaway is admirably ambiguous, keeping us guessing about her motivation and true nature throughout. The screenplay succeeds because we learn all the clues as the main character does. Being shot entirely from his perspective, we're constantly in his state of mind. It might be a complicated tale, but we're given time to decipher it, and it never gets too much to handle. The ending is pretty abrupt but satisfyingly bleak, and the final line has become synonymous with leaving alone that which you can't change, regardless of how hard you try. I won't be watching it again anytime soon, but I'm glad I got to see what is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, even if I don't quite concur with the consensus.",

The great point that draws attention to \"chinatown\" is his script, he is completely magnificent, I would say, which is a complete synthesis of the perfection of how to script a movie, in 2 hours we have complete development of all the characters, we have a simple plot which gains layers of depth every minute, we have problems that mix with the city, turning into a political and social plot while bringing a classic story of a detective full of twists, who at one point surrenders to the cliché, but then surprises the all showing that in \"chinatown\" there are no spaces for the obvious. The film touches on such as love, police, ethics, society, organized crime, rape, nothing in a very deep way but also nothing is shallow, it gives the introduction to the theme, and the viewer who links the dots, alias, \"chinatown\" is a film that has to be seen and reviewed to be able to connect the points in a more satisfactory way, and to have a broad and complete notion of its history, which is not easy to understand in the first one visited during the film. With a great photo, extremely clear and brings new york life together with an assembly that joins the script to bring a great rhythm to the film, and a soundtrack that combines but is not marked in technical parts, the film has no much to criticize, is not perfect, but is not far behind the artistic part of the film, part that brings jack nicholson who is incredibly in a centered role, and alias, doing a great performance, and the stunning Faye Dunaway, who we love and hate her throughout the film, and she makes the whole story run around her, and she succeeds in behaving like the guiding thread of the script, interpreting many facets. Polanski and his artistic team did a fine job here, their film is not perfect, it's true, but it's a pity that it's not such a remembered movie, because the same is wonderful.",

            "content": "In the 1970's a bunch of American filmmakers and actors were given a bunch of money and told to just go away and make movies. And that they did. The consistent results led to the 70's arguably being the best decade in cinema that America has ever produced. We were gifted such classics as Taxi Driver, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's, Mean Streets, The Godfathers and Dog Day Afternoon. Chinatown is another of those films that can be considered a classic among this elite list and one of a few from this era of filmmaking that time has been most kind to.\n\nPlot: In 1937 Los Angeles, private detective JJ 'Jake' Gittes (Jack Nicholson) specialises in matrimonial/cheating spouse cases. When he is hired by Evelyn Mulwray who suspects her husband Hollis - a high-profile engineer - of having an affair, he gets on the case and produces photographs of him with a young girl. It soon transpires that Jake was hired by an impersonator and not the real Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). When Hollis is found dead by drowning, Jake finds himself involved in a complex web of deceit involving murder, incest, and corruption that are all related to the city's water supply.\n\nOpening with Jerry Goldsmith's seductive and evocative noir score, Chinatown establishes it's mood from the very opening credit sequence and a perfect introduction of what to expect. Paying homage to the traditional gumshoe approach of Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, Roman Polanski has a confident handle on Robert Towne's meticulously detailed screenplay. No sooner are we introduced to Private Investigator Jake Gittes as he surveys the sun-kissed lands of Los Angeles while applying the tricks of his trade to tail and investigate the latest of his infidelity cases. Like all good noir's, however, our doggedly determined P.I. soon stumbles onto something much bigger. In this case, the possibility of murder and the financial benefits of gentrification. As a result, Chinatown becomes a labyrinthine puzzle of a wider political spectrum that reaches far beyond anything expected and where nothing is quite as it seems. \n\nIt's apparent from the offset that Chinatown is an impeccably crafted film with a measured pace and an attention to detail that has rarely been matched. There's so much on display that it's obvious that the entire cast and crew are operating at the top of their game; Richard Sylbert's production design perfectly captures the look and feel for 1930's L.A. and it's complimented greatly with John A. Alonzo's sumptuous cinematography. It's the twists and turns of Towne's Oscar winning script that impress the most, though. He keeps us at arms length for the majority of the film and never forces his hand a minute too soon. Nothing is rushed here as it marvels in patience. Even the title of the movie is elusive and doesn't fully make sense until the film is given time to play out. In the meantime, Towne and Polanski tease with smidgens of information peppered throughout the narrative. For the first time viewer this could be a slight challenge but Chinatown has grown in its stature over the years because it's has replay value. In fact, it demands it. This is not a film that can be appreciated in one sitting but if invested in, it all comes together masterfully.\n\nEven Jack Nicholson and his penchant for grandstanding is kept to a minimum. Nicholson keeps his usual histrionics at bay and although he displays flashes of his energetic approach to a character, his Jake Gittes is a far more reserved performance. Oscar nominated for his work, some still claim this to be Jack's best performance and it's not hard to see why. \n\nAn elusive masterpiece of mystery and intrigue. The beauty of Chinatown's narrative lies in the deceitful lies told by it's characters. So much of the dialogue and interactions are not what they seem and it maintains a sense of secrecy and mistrust that the story and film thrive on. At one point, John Huston's callous and calculated Noah Cross says... \"You may believe you know what you're dealing with but you don't\" - this quote, in itself, sums up the film which also has a knock-out reveal that you, simply, don't see coming. \n\nIt may be blasphemous to some (if not many) but my favourite of the sub-genre is still Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential. That said, Hanson's vision for that James Ellroy adaptation would, most likely, never have been possible had it not been for Chinatown leading the way in its style and composition. This is a timeless piece of cinema. Of course, the 1930's setting lends a hand but Chinatown hasn't aged in over 40 years which is a real testament to Polanski's approach to the material and the exemplary work by all involved.\n\nMark Walker",

Contrasting the transparency of Gittes with the confusion of both the story and other characters served to create a perfect mystery atmosphere. Yet the film dragged your attention away from the most powerful aspect of the narrative. In covering the nature of the film's main complication Polanski masterfully masked the true mystery. As we were concentrating on who may be dumping gallons of freshwater during a major drought, a mother struggled with her chaotic and tragically incestuous relationship with her daughter. While the main antagonist was ultimately presented as being the most obviously fitting character it was not for the crime the audience expected. It was for something completely unexpected and shocking. Therefore, Polanski inverted the conventional nature of a mystery film (it was not \"who\" had done it, but \"what\" in fact he had done.) On top of this was the role of the detective Gittes, who returned to the life he had left behind. By the end of the film, it became obvious that I was watching a tragedy. The film took so long to perfectly craft a mystery, which was ultimately never solved. Yet the brilliance of Polanski lies in the fact I no longer cared. What I cared more about was about what was introduced only minutes before. The destruction of a mother and daughters shocking yet optimistic relationship.",

Trust me, by the end of this movie you're going to be wondering if it should actually be referred to as the city of demons. \nJack Nicholson stars in Roman Polanski's Chinatown alongside Faye Dunaway and John Huston. Nicholson's character, J.J. Gittes, Is a private eye who delves into other people's secrets while trying to escape from his own. \nJ.J. Gittes is a private eye in a city where everyone has something to hide and on a regular afternoon, Gittes get asked to spy on a woman's husband to find out who he is being unfaithful with. This women is Mrs. Mulwray, wife of Hollis Mulwray, the chief engineer for the Los Angeles Water and Power Supply, an important and prominent figure in the city. Gittes gets the job done and the pictures end up in the local newspaper.\nHowever, when Gittes is approached and handed a lawsuit by a women claiming to be the real Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunawaya), he realizes he was setup. Gittes, who is not easily hoodwinked and values is reputation, sets out to figure out who wanted to setup Mr. Mulwray. \nThis is where the web of lies begins. And as Gittes digs deeper and deeper the web begins to unravel, and to surprising results. What begins as a scandal involving the corruption and manipulation of one of Los Angeles most important resources quickly turns in to a story involving a lot of people and their very personal secrets. And somehow, they are all connected. \nI don't really want to go too much into the plot because this movie really relies on its twists and turns that occur throughout the film. I can say though that this movie really has it all. It has an engaging story, great characters that I actually started to care about as the film went on. The atmosphere it brilliant, such a dark and corrupt story set in the backdrop of the beautiful Los Angeles.\nThere are three main characters at the forefront of the story. J.J. Gittes is our hero. He is a private eye who has secrets from his past that still trouble him. \"Are you alone?\" Gittes is asked at one point, and his response is \"isn't everybody?\" showing us just how lonely Gittes really is. Often times in this film Gittes is outnumbered and helpless and you begin to sympathize for him and his struggles and how impossible his task is.\nFaye Dunaway plays Evelyn Mulwray, a character which a lot of the twists and turns revolve around. We don't really find out who or what she really is until the latter end of the movie. And as the credits were rolling, she still seemed a mystery to me. \nLastly, but certainly not least you have John Huston, in one of his most chilling performances as Noah Cross. Cross is very rich man who is associated with the LA Water and Power Supply and who is also",

Jack Nicholson's J.J. Gittes is Philip Marlowe expanded on and accentuated a bit.  An effective detective who's probably too well educated and sensitive for his line of work.  He knows he can't actually make a difference against rampant corruption, but it still bothers him.  John Huston's Noah Cross is probably my favourite screen villain.  He's genial and completely evil in a fatherly way.  He's a man who does not care about what anybody thinks or does because he simply doesn't have to (note how he casually gets Gittes name wrong, says it right once when corrected, and then gets it wrong every time going forward).  The way he seems to absorb Katherine during the film's climax is one of the most quietly chilling images ever committed to film.",

            "content": "\"Chinatown\" wouldn't ever just be an exercise in modern film noir.  It was the film that cemented Roman Polanski's status as one of cinema's greatest living filmmakers, the film that propelled Jack Nicholson to the status of a bona fide star, the film that reminded the nation why Faye Dunaway was always destined to be more than Bonnie Parker, more than Vicki Anderson.  It was the film that went for the subversive when most of its kind safely turned to the arms of the homage; it was the film that stripped sexy romanticism away from the noir genre and ensured us that the detectives of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett's best works had it much better than their real-life counterparts.\n\tThere has, perhaps, never been a time during which \"Chinatown\" hasn't been gazed upon as being among the finest films ever made.  Upon release, it grossed almost five times more than its budget, was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, and was instantaneously deemed a classic of a genre most had previously thought to be dead.  It's a manifestation of what we consider to be a great film, marked by uncompromising, detailed direction, note-perfect performances, and a screenplay that, by the standards of the most serious of film circles, is one of the best ever written. We don't just watch \"Chinatown\"; we grab onto it with our beings, hypnotized by its storytelling, its visual opulence, its unforgettable cynicism.  For a little over two-hours, we are lifted from our theater seats and transported to 1930s Los Angeles, where illicit encounters are a thing of the everyday and where one's character has to toughen to survive.  \n\tWe cannot look for more when going to the movies; \"Chinatown\" is intoxicating in ways few films are.  We can smell cigarette smoke as it dangles in the air, the liquor on the breath of its focal private detective, the European perfume that licks the aura of its bewitching femme fatale.  Excitement runs as thoroughly through our veins as cryptic dread does; in a world as cruel as \"Chinatown's\" Los Angeles is, an expectation of eventual euphoria seems as close as it does far.  It's a mystery of a mystery movie - it's as familiar as it is foreign, a film noir we at first believe to be like all the others until we're gobsmacked with the realization that no noir has ever gone quite as far in its prevailing pessimism.  It traps us in its web of conspiracy, never to be released.\n\tFormidable, too, is the way it avoids the easy use of the noir stock character, a downfall for most contemporary films trying to be \"Kiss Me Deadly.\" Some of \"Chinatown's\" biggest successes revolve around the conception of its characters, which fill the roles of \"types\" we've come to know before (the sardonic private dick, the secretive femme he calls sidekick and lover, the ruthless villain easily able to hide his true evil) but do more than just stew in old characterizations and let the writing, the attitude, do the talking for them.  Its cast gives performances, with Robert Towne providing them with roles of distinguished depth.\n\tTake, for instance, its hero, J.J. \"Jake\" Gittes, who is of the Phillip Marlowe type but sidesteps rose-colored bitterness for forlorn optimism.  He is a private detective that smokes too much, who drinks too much, and who cares too much; take off his layers of put-upon snakeskin and you'll discover that he's kind, obsessed with the idea of making right.  Usually, he specializes in adultery cases, able to jump back and forth in-between them without emotion.  But in \"Chinatown,\" he is presented with a case that just might change his perception of the world he's come to know, and might leave him wounded instead of merely jaded.  Played by a scorching Nicholson (a risky but soundly advantageous casting choice), he's the first PI we've met in the movies that doesn't make dwelling in unremitting danger seem cool.  Peril is authentic, and Gittes doesn't always retain placidity a la Sam Spade - fear is a reality he'd like to escape.\n\tIn the film, Gittes is forced to take a break from his standard assemblage of adultery cases after he becomes involved in an all-encompassing conspiracy that works as an embodiment of the corrupt nature of the California government of the 1930s.  The investigation is prompted by the murder of Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), the reigning chief of the Department of Water and Power.  As the man was the subject of a former case (an imposter posed as his wife to attain pictures of Mulrway with a younger woman), Gittes cannot help but be drawn in, especially when suspicions are aroused that some corrupt happenings are occurring within the underbellies of the department.\n\tIn his process of probing and exploring the sea of enigmas before him, Gittes hardly goes unnoticed by Mulwray's many enemies - he's beaten to a pulp on more than one occasion, almost losing his nose in one of the scuffles - and he hardly goes unnoticed by those closest to him, particularly the man's wife (Dunaway), who is collected and beautiful but also knows much more than she lets on.  \n\t\"Chinatown\" has the fatalistic personality of \"The Big Sleep\" but lacks the incomprehensibility.  With a tight handling of its central mystery, it, unlike many detective noir movies, is just as much about plot as it is about atmosphere and character.  It could have been released sometime in the late 1930s, early 1940s, but then again, could such a disillusioned piece make it past the hit seeking heads of studio executives? With its callous ending, which is both devastating and integral to its overall impression, I hardly think so.  It is very much a work of the 1970s, a decade I consider to be the best in cinema (it's an explosion of all the masterworks prohibited by the Hays Code in previous years), but it simultaneously doesn't seem to belong to any decade, any category, choosing the 1930s as its setting yet remaining timeless in its nihilism. \n\tYou can see the care that went into its making; look at the way Towne so comprehensively elicits a forgotten era through the film's dialogue and historical foundation, the way Polanski exhaustively captures every bit of period detail possible.  Especially prestigious are Nicholson and Dunaway, two of the greatest performers of their peer group and certainly the best matched to the type of material presented.  With his self-confident drawl and smarmy swagger, we expect Nicholson's Jake Gittes to be a private eye even more confident than Mike Hammer.  But his poise is only a masquerade for doubt, and Nicholson evokes that impossible bridging of outside discernment and sense of self with a subtlety one normally doesn't associate the actor with.  And Dunaway, who battled with Polanski on set, is as pensively unblemished.  With her milky white skin, penciled-in eyebrows, seductive way of speaking, and immediate glamour, she is a femme fatale of the highest caliber until the film betrays her and reveals her to be a victim of life, not a dame out to cause trouble.   It's the deflection of the character types Nicholson and Dunaway undergo that makes \"Chinatown\" all the more arresting of a movie - the turmoil they face is sweepingly real underneath the pristine sheen of period influence, and our empathy, and interest, seldom ceases.\n\tBut the best thing about \"Chinatown\" is how it can both work as grand entertainment and serious cinema.  It bridges that gap between artistic intrigue and public accessibility, and that's how a film should be, easy to be appreciated, to admire.  It's unparalleled and unyielding - that's how it goes in Chinatown, anyway.",

Roman Polanski did phenomenal job directing, and even was good at acting. The director managed to get all of the actors to be on the same page. You could see that Polanski did put some work into directing.  But on times scenes seem to be purely driven, by Nicholsons acting, and star power. All in all, still a solid directing job.      I would rate it 16/20.\nCinematography - Even considering, that the film is quite old, and cinematographers didn't have all the modern equipment, job was done to perfection. John A. Alonzo managed to achieve marvelous work. Even though the film was filmed in sunny California, you can still fill the film noir atmosphere. There were few really impressive shots which you don't come across very often nowadays. Including mirror shots, that give viewer the illusion of following someone, and the other worthy mention is shot of chase in the lemon fields. The last really adds to intensity and made me wanting for the shot to be longer. A worthy Oscar nominee.       I would rate it 20/20\nWriting - An amazing story, with even more amazing characters. Story develops it self beautifully, and it seems like Gittes is always in front of the action. The story doesn't force itself on the viewer. Script paces itself perfectly although at the very end it felt a bit rushed and jumped straight to the very conclusion.     I would rate it 20/20\nScore - The score was amazing. Some of the tracks hit the perfect spots and gave me the goosebumps. Textbook film noir soundtrack, that really adds up to the whole movie vibe.      I would rate it 20/20\nActing - Was phenomenal Jack Nicholson was a true powerhouse in this movie and fit the role perfectly. His acting seem effortless and charismatic. All of the actors had this mystery shroud around them. And seemed they were hiding their true intentions. Actors chemistry was very mesmerizing to watch, because it seemed like every actor was pushing not only his own performance, but the colleagues as well. Even though through out the movie extras don't get a lot of screen time, you can definitely feel their presence in the movie.     I would rate it 20/20.\n\nAll in all, this movie is a truly masterpiece, a modern jewel of film noir. Worthy of being in the study program for any film school. Finally i would rate this movie 96/100. 1712. Alameda.",

            "content": "Jan. 4th, 2016- This noir classic is arguably the most important picture that made Nicholson the star that he is and for good reason. Roman Polanski does an incredible job of capturing the corruption of LA through satire but is equally disturbing when necessary. Probably the biggest aspect and something that's hard to see a lot nowadays is how all parts of production work together to bring a brilliant film. Polanski's work never stands out over Nicholson work which never stands above the great script by Robert Towne but when they all come together it becomes great filmmaking. And so as a result it stands as one the best films of Hollywood. A must watch if you want to see some quality old timers.",

I watched it recently for the first time in about 10 years and was just utterly amazed by the great directing from the legend Roman Polanski along with theÂ  cinematography and production in this movie. Beautiful set pieces a solid story line with suspense and action and a great script, this movie is also a really good period peice the costume design and set design are very accurate to the time. And the acting was great oh man Jack Nicholson was a force through the 70s and 80s he just demolishes his role, Faye Dunaway was also really good. If i have one complaint a out this movie is that its run time is slightly long and drags a little at points. But If you're a true Cinephile or movie junkie this is a 100% watch if you havnt watched this yet you're missing out on a cinematic masterpiece.Â  \n8.25/10",

            "content": "Grade: Lower 9/10 but safely there\n\nChinatown is a classic movie that is still talked of today as one of the very best. To be fair there is no doubting that this is superbly acted and the same goes for the writing and directing which all together makes this a fine film in cinema history. It also stays a mystery and never gives up the ending easily and leaves you not only guessing but also thinking about all the intricate details going on.\n\nNow Chinatown doesn't have the most exciting story, or maybe the premise doesn't seem exciting but the movie itself is good when it comes to the depth involved. The story is so well researched and so well put together, you don't need big thrills and gunshots everywhere to be made to enjoy this piece. I think one big thing about the plot is it's level of detail as mentioned as it is just overly detailed and really makes the plot thicker if anything.\n\nJack Nicholson portrays J.J. Gittes with a certain ease In his demeanour and a kind of worked out character that seems planned and as if Nicholson put a lot of work in before taking the role. Cast such as Faye Dunaway do a top job too here and she seems calm and yet her character is very complex and hard to figure out what's going on with her, the certain chemistry if you will between Nicholson and Dunaway could be analysed over and over and you can really see Gittes does not understand her fully. \n\nRobert Towne the writer creates a script that is considered among the very best in cinema, and I mean worldwide. It is calm and calculated and Towne makes a screenplay something more than well, a screenplay, he creates drama and intrigue in all the right places. The script is slow but somehow Towne makes it exciting in a way and lets you watch with an air of what's next around the corner, just a top job from a top writer.\n\nThe neo-noir style is in abundance, but it is safe in it's pickings of where to put it, it isn't overused in any case and when the biggest examples of neo-noir are seen, they work very well. I felt the score that is in line with the neo-noir style is a fine one and the late Jerry Goldsmith does a magnificent job in making quite bland and ordinary scenes seem yet again, exciting and also gives a lovely air of mystery even in the music.\n\nYou know many films we see the cinematography over looked and not really thought of as one of the highlights, but here it very much is the case and a big one. John Alonzo was nominated for an Oscar for his work but the fact that when people mention this they only go for the directing, writing and acting is an insult to the beautiful craft Alonzo creates. The shots are just so well timed and the close ups and very few cuts make this ahead of it's time in camera work for movies.\n\nOverall I felt it to be firmly a brilliant movie and one that should stay with the viewer no matter what they felt about it. I do feel this is overrated and without shooting me here me out, I can see why people love this and it definitely isn't a mystery why, it is just I didn't find this exciting enough to be flawless, but is still a wonderful and glorious movie that even with just what I say, is still near the very top.",

If he doesn't drop the case at once he faces threats of legal action, but he pursues it anyway, slowly uncovering a vast conspiracy.\n\nSome people may not know but I got a lot of things to do and those things are reviewing 8 Movies, three TV shows and two video games so basically that's why I'm a bit behind of the new releases. Then and now I have to take a little break or a day off from doing this because well I can be a bit tried of doing this, but I still have fun reviewing and I'm extremely proud to be talking about the great classics and the new films, TV shows and games that come out. Speaking of cult classics, Chinatown was on top of my list to watch next, because I heard nothing but amazing things about this movie and after watching it I can agree that this movie was outstanding.\n\nJack Nicholson is now known as the single best actor of all time just like Daniel Day-Lewis, Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, and in this movie his talent dose shine in this movie. He played his so well that I actually didn't fully hate him because in the movie his character is kind of a A-hole but I didn't hate him, if a different director took the director chair and directed the movie differently then maybe I would have dislike him. Jack Nicholson did probably his 4th best performance that I've seen from him.\n\nThe movie is filled with lines that I won't lie but the lines have stuck with me after the movie was over and I got to give the writers credit for that. The music in this movie  has that smooth jazzy beat to it and that totally fitted the movie so well. The cinematography in this movie was shot beautifully and just perfection with it's open and normal shots.\n\nFor problems I don't really have any problems to be honest.

I will say the acting is good as are the shots in the film.  It looks like it could have been made yesterday.  But can you honestly follow the plot well?

            "content": "\"Well, we're sitting here in Chinatown, and they're closing all the factories down!\" There are, like, a million songs about, if not named after Chinatown, and I ended up going with Billy Joel's \"Allentown\", because not too many people remember The Move's \"Chinatown\". Maybe I should have referenced that song after all, because no one at all would remember The Move if they didn't lead into Electric Light Orchestra, and this film probably wouldn't be remembered if it wasn't Roman Polanski's last film made in the United States... and if it didn't get a lot of nods as the Oscars, a lot of wins at the Globes, and recognition from numerous people as one of the greatest noir films of all time. Some people might wonder why I would figure that this film would be forgotten, but Roman Polanski has made so many films that if the pedophilia accusations didn't come in, he would have fled from the States just for a vacation. It's a good thing he did bail out, because there's no way he could have defended against accusations of his being a sexual deviant after a film this sexually creepy (A sexually-charged detective noir? That's new!), and I stress the adjective \"sexually\" because it's just not a Roman Polanski film if it isn't a little creepy... or a little too long. Even \"Macbeth\" got rather excessive and dull, and it had real warfare instead of these here California \"Water Wars\". Sorry if I'm offending anyone, but the name of a situation that serious always sounded kind of silly to me, as did the basic concept of a war over water, but make no mistake, this film, while plenty creepy, is not silly, although it, as good as it is, does have other things going against it.\r\n\r\nAs a neo-noir, this film broke a little ground, or at least impacted the formula for dramas of its type, but when it falls into convention, it falls hard, whether it be following Roman Polanski's usual storytelling structure and themes, or hitting noir tropes that range from a plot carrying themes of adultery, politically-charged murder, sexuality, etc., to an enigmatic lead who might be a little too enigmatic. Well-drawn and, of course, very well-portrayed by Jack Nicholson, the J.J. \"Jake\" Gittes character is a compelling lead, but not quite a distinguished one, for there is no immediate background on him, and only so many expository layers to a characterization that you'd think would be more fleshed out throughout the course of this lengthy, character-driven drama. As a matter of fact, while I understand that this film can't commit the noir sin of straying too far away from the point of view of its main character, this film also stands to flesh out its focal layers, as it gets to be a bit uneven in its progression, partly because it covers too much material, and takes it time to cover it. Running well over two hours and, of course, being directed by Roman Polanski, this film is way too long, with plenty of fat around the edges which, before too long, gets to be repetitious, having some limitations in storytelling dynamicity that could have been more easily overlooked if there was more dynamicity to Polanski's directorial storytelling. As it often is, Polanski's thoughtfulness is realized enough to be adequately compelling, with considerable effectiveness upon the incorporation of heights in material, but the director has always had a tendency to very often get carried away with his subdued atmospherics, and he does just that here, with a steadiness that makes a lot of the plotting material run together, stiffens pacing, and rounds it all out with a blandness that all too often slips into all-out dullness. Again, there is something inspired about Polanski's storytelling, leading to sound engagement value that, before completely wearing off, really kicks up with the thickening of plot, but when this film limps out, it crawls, down a formulaic, undercooked, uneven and altogether overdrawn path, until it finds itself running the risk of collapse into underwhelmingness. This film isn't quite what it could have been, but it is rewarding, with graceful subtlety, biting edge, and even taste.\r\n\r\nTaste can be found within Jerry Goldsmith's score, when it is, in fact, used in this largely deeply quiet and atmospheric drama, being rather formulaic in its noirish jazzy sensibilities, but lovely and effective in its tenderness, and carrying an artistic value which is even more subtle in John A. Alonzo's often flat, but reasonably handsome, shadowy cinematography. The stylistic trappings of a film noir are certainly there, and Roman Polanski at least works with those well, but as a director, he delivers on more than just aesthetic value, for although his trademark overt thoughtfulness gets to be seriously dull, and is ultimately too recurrent, it could have resulted in a flat film, if it didn't carry a certain atmospheric realization that immerses, and is biting once dramatic material comes into play. This is a steady and lengthy film that is heavy on mystery over action, so there isn't much material for Polanski to draw upon, but there is plenty of tension to spare, partly because of Polanski's directorial highlights, and largely because the story has plenty of meat to begin with. The dramatic material is a little lacking, and the human factor is further diluted by thin characterization, but as an extensive dramatization of a case to unravel the murder of a powerful and somewhat scorned man, driven by a charismatic lead, this story has potential. A lot of that potential is obscured by the Robert Towne's draggy, uneven and somewhat thin script, which mostly does a great deal of justice to the narrative, through sharp dialogue and sophisticatedly crafted set pieces, in addition to enough rich character drawing to make up just fine for developmental shortcomings. If nothing else makes up for characterization issues, it's the performers, with the lovely and emotionally solid Faye Dunaway stealing the show from time to time as a widow who wants to know about the affairs and fate of her husband, yet is concealing her own dark secrets, while Jack Nicholson, despite playing himself, carries the film with his trademark sparkling charisma, which fits the classic noir lead role like a glove and adds the hint of entertainment value this film needs to reward. The film is so slow and so cold so often that it comes very close to losing its reward value, but its sophistication is respectable, and the inspiration behind its thoughtful storytelling and endearing performances secure the final product as plenty compelling.\r\n\r\nWhen the case is closed, conventional aspects as a Roman Polanski film and noir thriller include an underdeveloped lead, while unevenness to a draggy story structure that is made all the more aimless by often dully cold direction most shake your investment, and threaten reward value that is secured by the solid score work and cinematography, generally effective direction, smart writing and charismatic acting that manage to make Roman Polanski's \"Chinatown\" an overly steady, but reasonably engrossing noir classic.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

Chinatown is a near perfect mystery thriller that I urge you to watch. Its Polanski's best work in my opinion. A+",

Each of the performances are great from Nicholson as the private detective with a past, to Dunaway as a suspicious Femme Fatale, and Zwerling as a powerful robber baron controlling L.A.'s water supply. The principal problem the film has is that it lacks drive, and in a movie that's a good 20 minutes longer than it could have been that can be fatal. It all builds to a final sequence of events that holds the film together and makes the run time worth it. 3.5/5",

I can't say this film is perfect because it does have it's shortcomings. Expectations were high the first time I watched this, due to it being handled by a praised director and that the film is now regarded as a classic by many. It is difficult to say negative things towards a film that is universally loved, but I don't believe in hiding my true feelings towards something and just go along with everyone else. I may be coming off, soundling like I'm going to say that this film is awful but I'm not. I'm just trying to say that this film does have minor flaws and that an opinion is an opinion, and one shouldn't be nervous or repressed into showing it. Getting a bit off topic, anyways on to the review.\n\nThe film was written by Robert Towne. Other notable films he has worked on were Mission Impossible and Bonnie and Clyde. I cannot say Chinatown is his best work as this is the only film I have seen from him, but what I can say is that he has made quite a good script. The film's plot focuses on a detective working on a case that seems deeper than what he thinks. The film is full of story, Towne isn't afraid to give the audience such a complex tale and the audience has to give their full attention, because if one key information is missed, one might mistake it for being a plot hole. The film is full of plot twists and half-hearted stories that it isn't short of keeping us surprised. The film has achieved in having the audience in thinking they have finished the puzzle but only to be fooled. In my first viewing, I never was able to grasp why the film was called Chinatown and what the line at the end of the film meant, as very little of the film takes place at the location and is only mentioned a couple of times throughout the film. After repeated viewings, I now understood what Towne was trying to tell us. Chinatown is a representation of the horrors of being too overly involved and that sometimes it's just better to just let things lie. Chinatown is also a symbol of Gittes' past, and the horrible events that transpired during his time there. Towne never lets Gittes fully explain his experience there because the film allows it to be explained as the film goes on. The film overall is like a huge conspiracy that involves more than just career disputes and disagreements, as it also personal relationships. Towne has written a protagonist that is empathatic and likable. Gittes is a character that I see as just a regular guy who has involved himself in something deep that he now can't get out of, not because it is against his will but rather his own curiousity got the better of him. The film's dialogue was a delight as it takes inspirations from the hard-boiled dialogue from classic noir films while making it appropriate for the new style of cinema. Towne has also written the dialogue to make it sound like gossip that is being passed along from one person to another, as gossips in general are usually misleading and is executed in a way to get us hooked. My issue with Towne's screenplay is the story relating to the mystery of the water. I just never found it that interesting and the payoff wasn't all that great, but luckily Towne has provided us with a very exciting story about family drama.\n\nChinatown was the first time Roman Polanksi has ever been nominated for Best Director, and the first time for his film to be nominated for Best Picture. He doesn't win an Oscar for the former until his 2003 film, The Pianist. Chinatown had stiff competition that year, facing up against films like The Godfather Part 2, The Conversation and Lenny. I honestly felt that The Conversation should have won that year, but Chinatown was a close second in my book. Chinatown is a well directed film, as the director wanted the film to truly be a throwback to the days of noir films in the 40s and 50s but also instill the style that was found during the time of shooting. Though the movie feels stylish, it doesn't draw itself away from the film's plot which is still the main focus of the film. Polanski wanted the film's plot to be followed in the mindset and perspective of the protagonist in order for us to have this first hand experience of the plot unfolding and at the same time it allowing us to get in touch with the character, allowing us to feel empathetic to his actions and decisions. Polanski only allows us to hear what Jake hears and see what Jake sees. Polanksi has employed this style before on Rosemary's Baby. If Polanski allowed us to see the whole picture before the protagonist does, then this film would have failed completely in keeping the audience interested or invested. The film doesn't so much play with our emotions as it stays at a constant tone throughout, it's as if the film is telling us that things will just get worse from here. Chinatown is a talky film and Polanski seems to use it as a driving force in creating the mystery and developing our curiousity of what comes next. Polanski didn't need the film to be stuffed with gun play and action sequences to keep our attention, keeping this film very minimal. This approach was also similarly found on his previous film, Rosemary's Baby. I admire that Polanski wanted this film to move at a slow pace, as this allowed the audience to take in the information and giving us time to grasp on to it. Though there were a few times where the film was giving me so much plot, that I needed a little bit more time to kind of wrap my brain around it. The film's plot could be better understood with repeated viewings.\n\nJohn Alonzo is the film's director of photography and he has worked on other notable films like Scarface and Harold and Maude. I truly enjoyed what he has done for those films, and judging from those and this film, it seems that he is a man who truly understands a director's vision. His films rarely looks the same, and this is because every director has a different vision on what their films would look like. Chinatown may be a period piece but Polanski never wanted the film to feel ultra stylish or pay too much homage to the look of the period, instead he wanted the photography to support the film's story. As Polanski has the film following the protagonist throughout the film, Alonzo has the camera following our character from behind kind of like we are investigating the case with him. Sometimes, Alonzo allows us to see things from Gitties' perspective like when he looks through the binoculars, subtly having the audience be put in his shoes. There are a few moments where Alonzo truly captures a time and place that has passed by us, by having the costumes and production design show off a sense of nostalgia.\n\nThe film's score was created by Jeff Goldsmith who has worked extensively on a large number of films, with some regarded as classics. Chinatown is one of those classics. Goldsmith's score in Chinatown is a nice throwback to the films during the height of the noir genre. The score creates this sensuality and sorrow due to the trumpets and piano. It truly creates a presence when it comes on. Polanski and Goldsmith has limited their use of the score though, only appearing in brief moments, casually not getting in the way of the dialogue. It is more used as a mood amplifier, in order for the scene to feel more than what it is.\n\nThe film's acting was great with Jack Nicholson giving a stand out performance. Nicholson was able to convey a man who is experienced in his profession and subtly carrying a sense of weight that seems to still haunt him. Faye Dunaway was great as Evelyn Mulwray. Dunaway, like Nicholson, plays off as someone who has a dirty past but she gives off more a sense of paranoia as if the walls were closing in on her. We can really see that there is more behind her words and her subtle reactions to certain moments or questions truly sells her acting. John Huston and Perry Lopez were also great in their supporting roles.\n\nChinatown's screenplay truly sells the film, even if I don't completely find every single detail of it very interesting. All the other components of the film are present to support the film's plot and overall they have done a wonderful job. I am torn whether I prefer this than Rosemary's Baby but even if the other fares better on me in the future, I still can't deny that this is a great film.",

Dunaway, like Nicholson, plays off as someone who has a dirty past but she gives off more a sense of paranoia as if the walls were closing in on her. We can really see that there is more behind her words and her subtle reactions to certain moments or questions truly sells her acting. John Huston and Perry Lopez were also great in their supporting roles.\n\nChinatown's screenplay truly sells the film, even if I don't completely find every single detail of it very interesting. All the other components of the film are present to support the film's plot and overall they have done a wonderful job. I am torn whether I prefer this than Rosemary's Baby but even if the other fares better on me in the future, I still can't deny that this is a great film.",

            "content": "Chinatown is the kind of film that creates film lovers and matures the taste of those who are already film buffs. Essentially a film noir set in 1930's Los Angeles, Chinatown tells the complex plot of \"Jake\" Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private investigator, who gets hired to find out whether Evelyn Mulwray's (Faye Dunaway) husband is cheating on her. He accidentally stumbles upon a deceptively more complicated and dangerous story. The first thing you'll notice is Jack Nicholson best performance on film which is not over-the-top, but superbly convincing and charisma-radiating. He takes traits from his character and adds them to his personality. Faye Dunaway is also quite good and has the ability to switch from calm, collected, and snobby to vulnerable, pitiful, and lost. If I had to choose whose film this was, Polanski's or Towne's, I'd have to go with Polanski. He creates some of the best atmosphere I have ever seen on film that is eerily dark hidden under a beautiful canvas. He even changed the original ending to make it more interesting, depressing, and above all, realistic. Robert Towne's script is nevertheless fascinating with tons of instantly quotable dialogue and an unpredictable mystery story. I do feel that this film could have been a genre bore if not for Polanski. The film is truly about the corruption of power and injustice. Polanski's wife was killed by Charles Manson's gang; she never did anything wrong except being a celebrities wife. This is his most personal story. Chinatown is of course an achievement in film making since it pushed Hollywood's schlocky boundaries more than ever before.",

Sure it's a classic, but aside from the cinematography, acting and visual beauty, Chinatown failed to impress me as a whole.\n\nRewatch\n\nWhen I first watched this classic back in 2014 I found it boring for the most part. Like a lot of rewatches, this one improved upon second viewing. Chinatown is a love letter to the B&W noir classics of decades prior and it aces in recreating that same atmosphere with its soundtrack, set and clothing design. It's a very slick and smooth looking movie.\n\nThe plot gains steam as the movie progresses, especially in the last hour. Everything before that, like my first time watching it, is hit or miss with a fare share of boring sections. The 'Water and Power' scandal gets tedious to follow but thankfully isn't permanent once the actual murder mystery takes precedence.\n\nOverall, I did like this film more this time around, but not exponentially. The ending was more effective for me on this viewing for sure.\n\n\"Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.\"",

None of that quite accurately describes Chinatown. The setting is Los Angeles, early 1930s. Private Detective Gittes (Jack Nicholson) has completed what was his typical catch-cheating-husband-in-the-act case. This husband, Mr. Mulwray, is an important figure in L.A. He was co-owner of the city's water department, and then gave it to the government so water would no longer be privatized. Not too long after Gittes takes photos of Mulwray and his secret lover, Mulwray is found dead in the ocean. Mulwray's widowed wife, Evelyn (Faye Dunaway), and her father Noah Cross (John Huston), former co-owner of the water department, hire Gittes for separate matters all linked to the death of Mr. Mulwray. On a larger scale issue, before his death, Mulwray was fighting against a dam that, unbeknownst to the public, would not be used to cure the city's drought, but instead for privatized land owners. This is as much as I can say without feeling I have revealed too much. There are countless plot points, and the film wastes no time in uncovering each one. You see everything through the eyes of Detective Gittes (not as literal as that may sound). That direction bridges a strong connection between the audience and Gittes, and it's a choice of Polanski I very much like. His other life choices.... errrrrr.\n\nDamn, do I want to talk about the story. I will abide to my no-spoiler rule and simply state that Chinatown is far more uncompromising and vicious than I expected, even as my expectations changed throughout the progress of the film. Nicholson and Dunaway, while arguably not the most versatile actors, each add juicy character to their roles. Nicholson is as devilishly charming as he always is, and Dunaway can turn from cold and callous to victimized in a heartbeat. An unrelated tone of the movie I really liked is that there is a light modern touch of how the era is depicted. When I say modern touch, I mean a more realistic touch -- profanity is stronger and racist jokes are addressed as racist, though I would never resist a good China man joke. I loved the story, the style, the acting, the scenery (it's not just Chinatown), the dialogue, everything. I was so involved that when I had to poop in the middle of the movie, I brought the movie with me to the bathroom.",

That is the main theme that director, Roman Polanski, is trying to explore here in this criminal film noir thriller starring Jack Nicholson as a wise and overly confident private detective who is about to learn that despite how much he wants to teach the bad guys a lesson perhaps things are a little out of his league. That is why the film is titled Chinatown, because it represents a time in Jake's (Nicholson's character) life where he wasn't able to make a difference in the police force and became cynical towards the world. \"Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown\" is what they told him, and that is why he decided to retire and become a private investigator working on his own. He doesn't want to forget it, he wants to catch the bad guys and balance things out. He doesn't want these rich executives to continue thinking they can get away with anything. That is exactly why he decides to investigate things on his own and begins to enter dangerous territory where not everyone is who they say they are. He slowly begins to uncover one lie after another, and that is what makes Chinatown such an entertaining and masterful thriller. We are part of the investigation and begin discovering things at the same time Jake does. We are as confident as he is that he is going to uncover everything. This is Jack Nicholson's movie from the opening scene and he delivers one of his best performances to date. Faye Dunaway is also interesting in her femme fatale role; we are never sure if we can trust her or not. Polanski has delivered a perfect homage to the 40's film noir thrillers. Chinatown will remain as one of the best classical films of all time. This is my favorite Polanski film, perfect in every way.\r\n\r\nJake Gittes seems to be doing well as a private detective in Los Angeles, since he specializes in infidelities and there are many in the city. His latest assignment is to follow Evelyn Mulwray's (Diane Ladd) husband who happens to be the builder of the city's water supply system. His name is Hollis (Darrell Zwerling) and he is fascinated with everything that has to do with water, but Evelyn is convinced he is having an affair. Jake accepts the job and begins following Hollis, and surely enough he photographs him with a younger woman causing a scandal in the city. Jake believes his job is done, until a Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes thundering into his office claiming that she had never hired him to follow her husband. Apparently the first woman claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray was only an impersonator and now Jake has a law suit in his hands. Surprisingly Mrs. Mulwray drops the law suit a few days later, and her husband is found dead after an apparent suicide. Jake is now hired by Mrs. Mulwray to discover who might have wanted her husband dead, and soon Jake will find himself uncovering an entire web of deceit and corruption that is much bigger than he thinks.\r\n\r\nThis masterful film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but only won one (Best Original Screenplay written by Robert Towne) considering it had to compete in 1975 with another perfect film: The Godfather Part II. One of the best things about Chinatown actually is the screenplay. There are so many great dialogues and quotes from this film that are still remembered today almost 40 years later. Chinatown is exactly what a classical film looks like. Polanski created a masterpiece by recreating the classic film noir from the 40's with great art direction, costume designs, and cinematography. The editing and the original score are also done wonderfully, but none of this would be enough if it weren't for the wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Chinatown deserves all the praise it has received over time and it has really turned into a timeless classic and one of the few that continues to astonish modern audiences. The twists and surprises in Chinatown continue to work today.",

            "content": "Jack Nicholsan. Roman Polanski. Faye Dunaway. On paper this movie is bound for perfection. Amazing and great. But sadly, it's not. It's a good film,I won't deny it, and in no ways is it a terrible one. But Chinatown is a weak film in my point of view, including a plot that seems like it could've came out of a procedural television drama. The characters also didn't matter in the end and were people I honestly didn't care about. Chinatown has that feel of great-noir, strongly induced by Jack Nicholsan's performance and Roman Polanski's solid direction. But Fay Dunaway's performance was bad, emitting no emotion from her character. I'm not sure whether her character was like that or it was just her, but either way I found it to be simple acting and style for a very complex character. I'll give Chinatown the fact that it has one of the most original plots in a movie, one that involves water damns, racism, incest, and strong symbolism. It's characters were also very new and different, some that I would say seem very realistic. But Chinatown is a testament to the people who attempt the noir genre and try to reinvent it. Chinatown doesn't invent the genre, redefine it, or make it popular; instead it took it and added plot elements and symbols that doesn't make a noir film, well, noir. But Chinatown's entire attempt at being a classic noir film doesn't isn't a complete failure, for Polanski's direction certainly is one of the best parts of the film, bringing you to place that feels like noir but doesn't act like it. Instead, Chinatown is a decent film showing off a town's morals, people, riches, and water issues. And I'm not that into a film about water issues.\r\n\r\n   Chinatown is a 1974 crime drama film, starring Jack Nicholsan, Faye Dunaway, John Huston, and much more. It;s written by Robert Towne and directed by Roman Polanski. It's about a private detective named J.J. Gites and when he is hired to solve the case about a man a woman thinks is cheating on her. And from there, things change. Quite a lot. Faye Dunaway's character gets caught up in all this. Danuway's character is one that is very complicated, but comes off as dull and very simple. She indeed has a huge background we don't learn about until later, but it was either her acting or her character that did not impress me. She was just a yawn whenever she was on screen, and I am not afraid to say was even bad acted. I just can't tell what it was, but I didn't like it. I'm pretty sure it's the character though, but in honesty, her character was interesting, though, like many of the other characters in this film. Especially Jack Nicholsan's, who's a private detective who usually does domestic cases. He hunts down men who cheat on women and women who cheat on men and get proof on what they're up to and why they're cheating. His new case, though, is not the usual. Stuff comes up, and things change for Nicholsan as his character progresses through the story. Nicholsan and Dunaway's characters form a romatic bond which is hard to buy for me, the chemistry kind of work, with Nicholsan doing most of the heavy lifting though. Their relationship just doesn't work and seems forced, and the \"romance in the air\" is, well, murky. But it's a strange couple in my opinion, something that stands out in this movie than others, such as I have said several times; the characters are so different. The main villain is predictable by the end though and is not very sinister. The other supporting characters we meet and say good bye to and meet again along the way though are fantastic. The local detectives we meet are excellent and it's intriguing to learn about Nicholsan's rivals between them. With a great set of characters, I just wish they were based around a different, more enthralling plot.\r\n\r\n   The screeenplay for Chinatown is not good. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not a good one. The plot was really confusing at times and it wasn't fully interesting to me. It was quite original, exploring a case that can very much seem realistic, but in the end, turned into something totally different involving characters I didn't very much care about. The plot wasn't fully realized until well into the movie, and it wasn't engrossing and it doesn't pull you in. The dialogue was solid, though, having a true noir feel that much of the film didn't have. But it's forgettable dialogue, and it was the driving force of the film while I watched it, but as of right now I can't remember a single quote except for the last lines of the film. The last lines though, much like the rest of the film, tried to mean something. The whole film tried to mean something, but I just can't grasp what it is. I know this film will be an entirely new experience for me when I'm older and have time to fully study it and understand it. But as of right now, the screenplay and plot were not good, and seemed like it was a simple episode out of a procedural drama such as CSI.\r\n\r\n   Roman Polanski's direction, though, is good. It's great. It was the one thing that brought that noir feel to the film that it's trying so hard to become. Polanski, in my opinion, is one of the most interesting directors out there, with a background that should well have in depression right now. But he's relentless, and you can see it in this movie. The way he's ready to throw you into this film, ready to move you in it harder and keep you inside. I wouldn't say it's deep direction that will keep you intrigued, but it was good enough to keep me watching. Polanski throws in symbolism as well, keeping a cut nose on Nicholsan through the bulk of the film, providing a sense of a false hero, a weak hero. One that can do great things but can also be hurt by a simple flick of a blade. It shows this man is not prepared to withstand what is coming for him, like most of us aren't, and in the end, he honestly couldn't withstand it. It's these things that I love about Polanski's direction, keeping the audience looking around the screen and analyzing not only the style, but what it does for the film and for the viewer as well. Polanski hit the direction in this film well and solid.\r\n\r\n   Chinatown is a good movie. It won't say it's bad, because as I wrote this film it has grown on me. The direction, the acting (disclude Dunaway), and especially some of the characters make this movie good. It's weak screenplay and strange story makes it so hard for me to think it's a great movie, because it really isn't. It's hard attempt at being noir was accomplished barely, and it still is hard not for me to see a movie that's trying to be something else when I watch this. Noir is not a genre a film should try to be. Noir is decided over time, whether it can keep that real grit feel to it and it's dark style. It needs to be subtle, softly said and not whimpering at you to believe it like this film did. Chinatown kept a dark style, but by the end it went all out and things changed. The whole movie was changing as I watched, and I just wasn't sure what to make of it as I do now. But I can tell you I liked this film. I did. Despite all my criticisms, I can understand why people love it, but I can't. It's a good film, but it just can't reach that greatness I wanted it to reach when I read about this film. It's either me, or the whole movie in general. Or mostly just the screenplay. Or some of the characters. It hope it's not just Faye Dunaway. 7/10.\r\n\r\nAnd please, if you are interested in hearing my thoughts or listening me talk more about this film, check out my podcast!

Also starring Faye Dunaway, who is constantly stealing the spotlight, pairing her with Nicholson becomes an instant classic on-screen chemistry. With a suspenseful mystery unfolding and tons of shifty character, the story of \"Chinatown\" holds up to Hollywood's current standards, keeping the viewer guessing from start to finish. Refreshingly hinged on a water diversion scheme, this storyline has both never been recreated and remains original for a classic noir. Critically acclaimed and recognized that year with 11 Academy Award nominations and one win (Best Screenplay), \"Chinatown\" often graces Top 100 films of all-time lists and rightfully so, becoming a staple in the dramatic mystery category of Hollywood film history.",

        {
            "content": "Chinatown is a classic, somber neo-noir that took the concept of film noir to a whole new level, redefining the concept in the sense that it took the bold move to create something far more complex, deep, and devastating than previous outings of the genre, while still retaining the style and suspense that the genre stands for. Despite having all the familiar elements of the genre, whether its the unique visuals and style, detectives, politics, or henchmen, Chinatown feels like its paying homage to those old noirs, embracing the familiarity of those elements, while adding heaps of social commentary and complexity to make this neo-noir more than meaningful and distinguishable, rather than an all-out style over substance noir. It's part mystery, part psychological drama, and part social commentary on the division of classes and corruption in our nation and during the '30s. Yet with all these layers, Chinatown still somehow finds room to make itself an intriguing, entertaining, and very suspenseful journey, mainly thanks to Robert Towne's screenplay, which may just be one of the best ever written, or if its the cynical performance by Jack Nicholson.\n\nChinatown follows a private detective named J.J. \"Jake\" Gittes, who's visited by a woman who claims she's named Ewelyn Mulwray who's concerned about her husband, Hollis, asking Jake to investigate him as she thinks he's having an affair. Hollis also happens to be the engineer of the Los Angeles Department of Water, and at the same time, Los Angeles is caught up in the middle of a bad drought. Jake performances surveillance for a day on Hollis- however, later, Jake finds out that Hollis went missing, only to turn up drowned and dead. After coming back to his office, he's visited by the real Ewelyn Mulwray, telling Jake that they've never met before, and threatens Jake with a lawsuit for his involvement. Jake continues his investigation regarding this scenario, and the intricate plot follows him through a journey of deceit, murder, and secrets, with his intention to uncover what he believes involves a conspiracy with unknown motives. The plot sounds convoluted, but in reality, it's quite easy to follow, while increasingly becoming complex as time goes on. This may be the case considering I was so invested in the gripping plot that I didn't miss a single detail, and as a result I found it somewhat easy to follow. One of the fascinating aspects about this movie is realizing how complex the plot has increasingly grown by the end of the film, and it's definitely rewarding.\n\nI can't stress enough how phenomenal the acting is here, especially the cynical, hard-boiled performance by Jack Nicholson. He outshines most actors when it comes to roles like this in a neo-noir, with the typical fedora, coat, and cigarette, but with so much more depth. It's almost as if Jack Nicholson was playing himself. He's a tough and upright man, yet he's damaged as well, and he often reveals that when he's in a troubled scenario. He feels like he has plenty of energy, yet he still feels like a quiet man, as if he was playing the Joker but quietly. Apart from Jack Nicholson, we have Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray, and similar to Jake, she has a damaged, troubled past that remains a secret until the end. She's clearly a vulnerable character, and at times, she almost feels as if she were some detached, distant, reclusive doll. Evelyn has that weird presence and sense of deceit and mystery, common in many previous noirs. The way she and Jake play off of each other with great chemistry makes the movie worth watching alone, but there are some other great performances here as well, and the movie wouldn't be anywhere as good without them. John Huston, the director of the incredible classics, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and The Maltese Falcon, surprisingly has a role here, and between Jack Nicholson and himself, I can't tell which one's the real star of the show. John Huston plays Noah Cross, Evelyn's father, who's the former owner of the Water Department along with Hollis Mulwray. He doesn't have much screen time in the movie, but for what he has, he's a cold, repulsive man, and you honestly hate him to bits by the end of the movie.\n\nOf course, as with many noirs, there's a sort of \"standard\" that must be reached in order to classify yourself in the genre. There's the vibrant yet shadowy colors, the alternatively beautiful and depressing score, the twisty detective plot, and the dread, danger, and anxiety of the era. The cinematography has the familiar beautiful yet hostile and mysterious feeling, and Jerry Goldsmith's amazing score remains among my favorites I've heard in a noir movie. There's the familiar oddly lit, dark and beautiful atmosphere, and there are plenty of fedoras, coats, and cigarettes to gaze at. There's the femme fatale that the protagonist falls in love with, as well as the constant paranoia that both the audience and the characters feel through the movie. Polanski is at the top of his game here, fully utilizing all these classic noir elements yet adding so much more. The ending took me by surprise, and it practically killed my spirit. For those last five minutes, I honestly couldn't believe my eyes, and I was both riveted and sharking, the highest compliment I can give to an ending like that. Some may complain of the change of tone for the ending, and I've heard some say that it almost singlehandedly ruined the movie, but obviously, there's a significant meaning behind it that's not very hard to notice. Everything before the ending is happy and entertaining while being suspenseful and dark, but the ending turns the tables, and it shatters everyone in the movie, as well as the audience. People can't always control fate, but fate controls them. The American Dream and the authority behind the city are corrupt and failures, and the common people are helpless. Good intentions are suppressed, and the division of classes between the rich and the poor is unfair and meaningless.\n\nI'm not jumping on the \"bandwagon\" when it comes to Chinatown, and I honestly loved it just as much as I expected to. Chinatown has clearly stood the test of time as a mature, poignant neo-noir, and it's just as powerful and affecting as it most likely was back in '74 when it was first released. With its mysterious, seemingly complex yet simply easy to follow plot, its dark yet beautiful atmosphere, its underlying themes that still pack the same punch today, and all the classic noir elements that defined the genre, it's honestly no wonder as to why Chinatown is one of Polanski's biggest achievements. Chinatown is one of those films from that very long \"list\" that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime. Whether you're a huge fan of Polanski, the genre, or movies in general, Chinatown is one noir not to be missed.",

Everything is just so damn good in this movie because everything is done to perfection. To me the best thing about this movie is Robert Towne's script. Towne's script is one of the best written scripts in the history of cinema because it's just so brilliant. The film's story is one of the greatest ever told, it is a fantastic mystery that had me guessing throughout the entire film and as it went on it kept surprising me. This film can also be a drama and the dramatic scenes in this film are so raw and powerful, it's just truly incredible how spectacular this script is. Towne's script also has some sharp and clever dialogue that sounds so cool coming out of the actors mouth (mainly Nicholson's character). Roman Polanski does a magnificent job bringing Towne's script to life because he films the movie as if it were a film noir in the 40s and 50s and is just added something extra to the film. Well, I guess he would have to shoot it that way since this is a film noir. The performances are all great but everyone knows that the standout performance here is from Jack Nicholson. Nicholson just knocks it out of the park because you truly believe he is his character. Also great in this movie is the beautiful Faye Dunaway who plays a very mysterious woman. Another thing that is truly amazing in this movie is the set designs and costume designs, this film takes place in the 30s and the set/costume designs truly capture the look of the L.A. in the 30s. Also capturing that 30s feeling is Jerry Goldsmith's score which is astonishing. Overall Chinatown is a classic film that everyone should see at one point in there life.",

His body of work speaks for itself, his 1974 magnum opus speaks for its decade, reality in the face of theatricality, and for the sanctity of the cinema itself. Now although it is not completely justifiable to prove whether Polanski is or is not a genius, it is rather important to discuss the life of this idolized and wanted man. Roman Polanski was born in the year 1933 in Paris to Polish parents. When his mother and father were forced into concentration camps for being Jewish, Polanski was faced with the unmeasurable difficulty of surviving the Holocaust on his own. His Mother ultimately fell victim to the horrors of Auschwitz. If that's not enough, if you would so melodramatically, fast forward to the year of 1969. To the Summer Of Love. To the end of the small portion of Polanski's life he would later recall as the happiest he's ever had. He had a beautiful, talented, and adoring wife. Her name was Sharon Tate. The baby inside of her, she and Roman would never name. In August of 1969 the Manson Family laid slain to Sharon Tate and the baby inside of her, both terrorizing and taunting, the darkest chapter of Polanski's life was marooned with notoriety and fear. It was only a few years after the death of his wife where Roman would leave his mark on the world forever.\n\nChinatown flows with a lavishly perfected Noir tone, and I should add here, the film is the Neo Noir archetype, the best of its kind and one of the best that Film Noir carries in its respective canon. Also, whenever one sets out to write about Chinatown, one cannot understate the delicacy, the supreme handling of pacing which is to be found in this particular film. Not before, and not since, has pacing been so well thought out, so marvelously calculated, and devilishly crafted.\n\nJack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway stand immortal in this film, bellowing through the tenement halls inside of every dirty city confined within every Noir film in rotation. If Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway stand luminous as Kings of their respective Kingdom, then John Huston stands apart; shrouded in darkness, transparent, eager, vicious, immediate. John Huston's 'Noah Cross' exists, alright, and the most dangerous thing about the 'Noah Cross's of the world is that the evil within them is otherwise ordinary, bottomless, and unstoppable. Robert Towne's script is simply impeccable. Flawless storytelling accompanied by snappy dialogue, and a climax that cuts deeper than that of documentary reality.\n\nBut it is Polanski who is the true star of this picture. You can see him in every shot, peering in through the lens, and directly into your heart. You can taste him in every dry patch of dialogue, smell him in the midst of gun smoke, and fear him as the tension culminates into the wake of tragedy. It is there, in the tragedy, he dares you to hope for the best, he wants to feel safe because films make you feel comfortable. He takes the trust that he'd earned from the audience, and crushes it, oh, and he makes sure it stings. He makes sure it hurts. And in in the aftermath of the his final act, his final betrayal, the ultimate tragedy, he makes sure you can feel him. He leaves you in pain. He leaves you guilty in satisfaction. Knowing that tragedy is the most universal of luxuries, Polanski makes that perfectly clear, and for the first time, his voice is heard, his war cry. Coherent and horrifying.",

            "content": "CHINATOWN is in every essence of the word, \"perfect\". Starting with its wonderfully crafted screenplay by none other than the great writer, Robert Towne. Ending with the precision and craftsmanship with a camera and controversial decision making of none other than great filmmaker, Roman Polanski. A masterpiece was created. I also cannot even start to mention the greatness of this film without name dropping Jack Nicholson as the witty, charming and cocky J. J. Gittes. A man always trying to do the right thing while still uplifting his ego in the process. Mr. Gittes makes decisions in which spiral the movie to its bitter and disturbing end. There is no happy ending in CHINATOWN. No smiles or giggles from the audience. Only shock and awe of how things turn out in the world Towne created and the outcome Polanski decided. While skeptical at first, today Towne believes the ending Polanski persisted on was the right choice. The film simply wouldn't work without such an impactful ending.  The films success is also due to its unbelievably brilliant revelations in the story. Almost every single scene in the film ends on a note that reveals new information on the puzzle Mr. Gittes must solve. I think that's why the screenplay is so highly regarded. Every element of the story is revealed to the audience with such love and care. It's also a film that demands multiple viewings. There is no way one can truly respect a film of this magnitude without multiple viewings. In all honesty everything just makes more sense the second time. You're more just in for the ride the film takes you on in your first viewing, as on the second viewing one understands the revelations much more and one is able to grasp every element easier. The film is just really perfect, there is nothing else like it, the best noir film in my personal opinion and just an all around entertaining mystery with names like Polanski, Towne, and Nicholson in the spotlight, you can't really go wrong. What a classic!",

Whether it is the clean look in the visuals or its technique of not going with all the bare details in story or its characters.\n\nThat certain mystique is especially captured so beautifully in 'Chinatown.' It's a story that pulls you into a big mystery, but ultimately it feels like the town is full of mysteries. One thing I have to say I love is the effectiveness of the title, in that after watching the movie it finally takes on the true colors of what the movie is about and really gives meaning to what is disturbing about what I just witnessed on screen.\n\nAnd I'll leave it at that. I could go on about the acting performances that really give strength to the film. All I could say is that the collaborative effort of the creation of the story, its characters and its atmosphere all culminate in creating a movie that is truly dark and brooding. It's basically a movie that will stick with you. This is probably a horrible review, but I guess I just want to let anyone know who might read this that this is fucking classic.",

            "content": "Chinatown- 8/10\n\nWater,  that's the root of all evil in Chinatown which makes it so much more mysterious and enchanting and so ever confusing that at the end you end up wondering and putting all the pieces of the movie together.  Chinatown is ever so mysterious, gripping, enthralling and enchanting and backed up by some stellar performences by Jack Nicholson and Co, a gripping and uniquely mysterious story which keeps you wondering about the parts of the movie and putting all the parts of the movie correctly and some powerful yet amazing background music throughout the movie which really sets the tone for the movie, all these things in the movie are superbly put together and presented by the Amazing Roman Polanski who yet again makes a movie which keeps you gripped and wondering throughout the movie and in Chinatown he has made what is one of the best and most thought-provoking mystery movies of all time which needed no action or dramatic fight sequences for it to become a stellar mystery movie by the brilliant Roman Polanski.\n\nThe Story which is written by Robert Towne is revolving around the activities of J.J Gittes who is a private investigator and one day he is given the job of following Mr Mulwray and his day to day activities by Mrs Mulwray, and as he does so during which he does find out that Mr Mulwray was indeed having an alleged affair with another woman, he notices that Mr Mulwray is onto something else as well. And As  he dies in a alleged suicide near the damn, Gittes gets more inquisitive on what Mr Mulwray was really looking onto. He finds out a bunch of things about the drought and what is causing it, and finds out about a dirty secret about why there is a drought in L.A. While trying to figure out why Mr Mulwray was actually murdered and did not attempt a suicide, he ventures into a dangerous path and while discovering what really happened to Mr Mulwray and what he was trying to protect, he discovers a lot of unexpected things which do not end up well for everyone in the end.\n\nNow This movie has quite a limited cast which do not have many characters in the story and definitely do not have many  widely reknown actors other than Jack Nicholson, and considering that the cast was small everyone of them did a great job in creating the atmosphere throughout the movie and portraying their characters as well as anyone could. Jack Nicholson leads the cast portraying as the inquisitive, bold and foxy private investigator Mr J.J Gittes around whom the story is based  upon, and Nicholson shows us why again he is reknown so much for perfectly portraying every role he chooses and again shows the variety of ability in him to portray all kinds of different characters. His Portrayel as Gittes was his usual amazing calm self, and his speciality is that he does not need any action scenes or any powerful catch dialogues for him to show his presence to the audience. His facial expressions, dialogue delivery and attitude as the investigator J.J Gittes is quite perfect and he again becomes the character itself and having a director such as Polanski by his side, gives yet another marvelous performance which shows the variety in him. Although this movie is mainly based upon Nicholson's character, the actors supporting him have also done a great job in their respective roles. Faye Dunaway especially does well as one of the few female actors in this movie portraying the wife of the victim Mrs Evelyn Mulwray, and her character is mostly scared throughout the movie with a  lot of secrets, and she does a great job in portraying and presenting her character very well. John Huston also does a brilliant job in portraying the father of Evelyn Mulwray , Noah Cross who is an arrogant, intelligent rich guy who also wants Gittes services for taking care of his daughter. His character is one of the complicated ones in this movie and neither does he get much screen-time, but he utilizes the most of whatever he does get by giving a memorable performance. The Other remaining actors in the movie also did a really good job in portraying their characters convincingly and helped their  Director a lot.\n\nWell, I have'nt seen much of Roman Polanski's movies but of whatever I have seen, I realized that he really gets his audience to really concentrate on the movie throughout its play-time because if you miss any part of the movie it really gets hard to understand it completely and he really gets the audience to absorb themselves into the movie. Chinatown is absolutely this kind of a movie because if you miss parts of it, you wont really understand it completely because its quite mysterious and complicated. Chinatown starts out a bit slowly but right after MulWray's death things begins to become interesting and the base of the movie is put out. Polanski has used his cast to its full-extent and has made sure that all the actors have done the best as they can in portraying the characters of the movie, some of which are quite complicated. He and Nicholson have really worked brilliantly together and Nicholson has done superbly for making this movie so popular and interesting and all credit goes to Polanski for gathering the best for that kind of a role, and also making the less-popular actors act superbly as well. He gives this movie that kind-of an ending that you keep wondering what really happened and putting all the pieces together once again, and are quite confused yet mesmerized at the end of the movie. He has presented this difficult and mysterious story superbly as well with his brilliant direction, and choosing that kind of a background score really amazes you and keeps you hooked to the sequences fully. He has portrayed corruption and greed superbly in this movie Polanski has made a real gem of a thought-provoking  mystery movie in Chinatown, one of the very best of all time and because of its subtle and mysterious genre, it may be the best of its particular genre of all time.\n\nThe Screenplay which is written by Robert Towne is filled with thought-provoking dialogues which keep you glued to the movie through-out its play-time and some of the dialogues especially from Nicholson and Huston are really interesting and thought-provoking. The Dialogues are delivered superbly by the cast as well and this screenplay was superbly presented by the brilliant Polanski as well, so all credit to Robert Towne for such a brilliant screen-play and story. The Story is a really unique and mysterious one as well with the most interesting topic which is ''Water'' and the style by which the story was presented was brilliant and really keeps you wondering throughout the movie as well as after the movie.\n\nThe Cinematography was quite great as well as the early L.A was shown superbly by cinematographer John A.Alonzo did a really good job with the cinematography and camera-work of the movie which were especially convincing and good as well. The Costumes worn by the actors really pleased me as well, and the costume designer Anthea Sylbert has really put a sense of realism and originality to these characters in the movie and all credit goes to Anthea for such good costume design. \n\nThe  Background music has a lot of part in this being so superbly made, because the background music is the thing which really sets the tone for the movie. It really sets the mysterious and unpredictability to the movie and the different kinds of instruments used for this background music are synchronized so well with the sequences that I was amazed and taken aback a little by how influencial the background music was to this movie and all credit goes to Music Director Jerry Goldsmith for delivering such amazing and influencial music which really helps to create the mysterious tone maintained throughout the movie.\n\nNow, Chinatown is not really the entertaining types or the action-packed type of a movie, It is a really serious and thought-provoking mystery movie which one has to carefully and fully concentrate on because if you miss a scene you could really miss a lot of the movie. Chinatown is really though-provoking and enthralling kind of  a mystery movie which keeps you thinking and wondering throughout the course of the movie and Director Roman Polanski with the brilliant Jack Nicholson and his great staff has made one of the best mystery movies of all times which keeps you thinking and wondering throughout the movie and also after it.",

Very early on the audience knows that this isn't going to be just like any old film we've seen before and it just keeps building up and up to the ending that was very risk taking and I'm glad Polanski changed the end, or rather, actually wrote and ending. The original that was going to happen was very cliched albeit what the audience probably wanted to see but the ending that has gone on into movie legend is all the more greater and the final quote has been left up to interpretation and interpreted in many ways.

Jack Nicholson plays a very unusual role for him, because he usually plays crazy guys.  This is his third bets performance after One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and As Good As It Gets. L.A.

Mas o grande responsável pelo sucesso de Chinatown é sem duvida Robert Towne que criou um roteiro digno de um Oscar, um Globo de Ouro e um BAFTA, como melhor roteiro de 1975. A estrela do filme foi o já famoso Jack Nicholson (Five Easy Pieces 1970 e The Last Detail 1973) que contracenou com Faye Dunaway (Bonnie and Clyde 1967) e o diretor, roteirista e ator John Huston que já tinha vencido dois Oscar em 1948, como diretor e roteirista de The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.",

Polanski's film is a masterpiece of the cinematic medium, gripping, grasping and complex, with a story that twists more than a meandering river. Nicholson excels in the lead and Dunaway gives an exceptional performance. Chinatown is a film that is perfectly constructed and is a look at the seedy underbelly of big cities and a look at the (still, sadly, ever lingering) notions of lies, greed and underhandedness of big money business deals and how they ignore society. A masterpiece from gentle beginnings-to mysterious core- perfectly cynical end.",

Chinatown immerses us in it's rich, vivid, complex characters & carefully builds a very precise & fully engaging story that may take a couple viewings to fully appreciate. \r\n\r\nFaye Dunaway plays Evelyn Mulwray, Gittes client & Dunaway knocks her performance out of the park with each delicious scene. This is a film lovers film with examples of some of the finest work in this medium in scene after glorious scene. Chinatown is really a much more brilliant film that it may first appear to be and what a film it is.\r\n\r\nChinatown is a masterpiece and one of the finest films ever made.
