I am a huge Star Wars fan, but this still beats Empire into second place.\n\nIt brilliantly tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, the Grandson of the original Dr Frankenstein, who inherits the Family Castle.  Gene Wilder is excellent as Dr Fronkensteen.  Marty Feldman is great as Igor, not Egor, with his spot on comedic timing, Teri Garr is unbelievable sexy as Inga.  Mel Brooks' regulars Cloris Leachman as Frau Bl\u00fccher (Horses whinny) and Madeline Khan as Elizabeth are as funny as ever.  And of course cannot forget Peter Boyle as The Monster...\n\nFilmed in Black & White, to pay homage to the original 1933 movie, it also borrowed the original movie's equipment.  The fact it's in Black & White stupidly puts a lot of people off one of the greatest comedies, of all time.\n\nGene Wilder's only stipulation was that Mel Brooks was not allowed to be in front of the camera and it shows.  All his talent and skill are ensuring that each scene is hilarious, with loads of visual gags.  I personally feel that it is his masterpiece.\n\nLook out for the cameo, off Gene Hackman, as the blind man...",

Wish they kept that deleted scenes focusing on the recently deceased descendant of our main character, it was hilarious. A perfect spoof film for Halloween if you're seeking something more sophisticated than the raunchy, gross-out humour of Scary Movie (though I do still like that movie). Blazing Saddles is still the better film, though. That one qualifies as Mel Brooks' magnum opus in my eyes. It helps that it doesn't parody any specific Western. But they're both comedy classics either way :)",

The supporting performances are also a delight, Madeline Kahn's bride, Gene Hackman's blind hermit and Marty Feldman's hunchbacked Igor are very memorable.

            "content": "I just watched Young Frankenstein for the first time last week. And it is now competing for my favorite Mel Brooks movie. Spaceballs still holds a high position in my movie watching life, so it will be tough to ever top that. This film has the same vibe however. I really enjoyed it from the beginning. I\u2019ve never been too crazy about monsters like Dracula, Werewolves, or Frankenstein. But when done well like anything else I appreciate it. As I was watching this movie it was clear that Mel was completely comfortable and in control of his direction and style that he wanted to do. The mix of spoof humor with spookiness is very well done and melded together. Gene Wilder is just a treasure as soon as his character, Dr Frederick Frankenstein, appears. The different take on this story is clever and just cheesy enough to not be annoying, but put a smile on my face! There was some crazy, zainy characters that could have been too much, but worked well with the tone the movie set from the beginning. I really felt Brooks had a pulse on what he wanted this movie to be. As I\u2019ve said with other directors, Mel Brooks style will not be for everybody, but he has a clear plan for what he is setting out to do every time he makes a movie including here. There\u2019s even a few small, clever, humorous twists that happen that are done well. I would recommend this movie to anybody that is a movie fan. Especially if you are a slap stick physical comedy fan. This is Gene Wilder at peak comedic performance. It was also nice to see Peter Boyle as the monster. And to see legendary actors Cloris Leachman and Gene Hackman was nice. I would see this movie if you haven\u2019t yet, as I can tell how this movie is declared a classic by many! ",

Those who fail to appreciate his humor will be left puzzled by the shenanigans, and that's perfectly understandable.  The movie is filled with slapstick, cringe-worthy puns, and silly \u2018dad' jokes, but it is done with great style.  Part parody and part homage to James Whale's Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, the film follows Dr Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) as he follows in his grandfather's footsteps in bringing life to the dead.  Featuring great sets, atmospheric lighting, beautiful black and white cinematography, and a fantastic cast that seems to be having a ball, it's a lot of fun to watch, despite the fact that a lot of the jokes miss the mark, especially if you're not a fan of Brooks' often juvenile humor.",

Mel Brooks would continue making notable films but they would lose critical appeal with each new outing. Young Frankenstein was at the height of his filmmaking career at this landed with a loud impact at the box office. Very funny and quotable. 03/05/2020",

Clever scene wipes, mixed with more modern film making brings forth Brook's strengths as a director. Plus, you get to see the creation tap dance!

            "content": "A fearsome neo-noir comedy!\n\nMel Brooks' horror spoof Young Frankenstein (1974) is a flurry of fog lit paths, dark nights, candle lit rooms, and hilarious jokes! Brooks aimed to parody gothic literature's Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein, which he accomplishes as he created one of the best adaptations of the book. Young Frankenstein is a dark and moody comedy taking on noir aesthetics with a light-hearted tone. All the jokes are good natured and silly enough for anyone to laugh along with because Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder write insanely creative punchlines. Young Frankenstein gives you euphemisms, metaphors, monologues, speeches, puns, dance numbers, and electric reanimation!\n\nBrooks proves he is an all time great director with Young Frankenstein. Brooks finds morbid humor in the autopsy classroom, grave-robbing at night, reanimating the dead, and sleeping with a corpse. You witness beautiful cinematography at Wilder arrives in Transylvania's train station. The fog surrounds him, shrouding Wilder in mystery, the black background is eerie. All this in a comedy! I also love the grave-robbing sequence as it's creepy, then hilarious as the rain falls. The hypnotic violin melody is a legitimately beautiful theme for Young Frankenstein despite this film being a comedy. Mel Brooks is simply a comedic genius!\n\nGene Wilder is erratic as the mad scientist Dr. Frederick Frankenstein. His wide eyes and wild hair enthrall you the entire time you're watching Young Frankenstein. He gives a great melodramatic performance of madness as he screams, \"Life!\" Wilder pulls off endless medical dialogue and nonsense about bringing the dead back to life with total conviction. He sells the serious aspects of Young Frankenstein.\n\nTeri Garr is gorgeous as Wilder's voluptuous assistant Inga. She is one of my favorite parts of Young Frankenstein because she is so free and fun loving. She's clearly having a wonderful time goofing around with Gene Wilder and completely sells her jokes with her easy going nature. She's adorable in Young Frankenstein! Garr plays up being scared, frustrated, and infatuated so well that you forget about the plot when she is on screen. I especially adore her perky German accent or whatever Garr was going for in Young Frankenstein.\n\nMarty Feldman was born to play Igor in Young Frankenstein. His steady crouched walk, hunchback jokes, cross-eyed bits, and sarcastic commentary livens up the dreary style and serious performances. Feldman chews up the scenery and establishes himself as a comedic great.\n\nPeter Boyle makes you feel genuine empathy for his version of Frankenstein's monster. He plays so many slapstick moments and verbal jokes with the perfect amount of groaning and fear. Boyle is The Monster and a massive presence in Young Frankenstein.\n\nMadeline Kahn is just insanely funny as Elizabeth. Her fancy dressing and penchant for singing keeps you laughing whenever she is on screen. I love her little girl voice that she goes into for many of her jokes. It's so silly and fun that Kahn just steals scene after scene.\n\nOn the other hand, Cloris Leachman gives a fantastic turn as the movie's sort of villain Frau Blucher. Her expressive face and eyes give her a captivating gravitas for Young Frankenstein. I like the silly performance of heavy accent, to the point of being unintelligible, from Kenneth Mars as Inspector Hans Wilhelm Friedrich Kemp. His bit of moving his wooden hand or replacing his monocle over his eye patch is just too funny. I appreciate his overly heavy accent more each time I watch Young Frankenstein.\n\nI have to mention the fact that Mel Brooks got Gene Hackman to cameo as the friendly blindman. His lonesome priest desiring a friend is funny as he delivers some of the funniest slapstick moments within Young Frankenstein with his soup and wine spilling gag. I particularly find Hackman endearing here as he realizes The Monster is mute.\n\nOverall, Young Frankenstein is a timeless comedy of clever parody and peerless direction. Mel Brooks should be proud of this one forever. It's arguably his greatest film by all virtues of phenomenal filmmaking and outstanding acting.",

Also it's a slap-stick comedy, and it works on all these levels! \n\nIt pokes fun at every ridiculous Gothic clich\u00e9 with a very inventive and various ways that still hold up to date. But it's the editing that stands out above the rest ways. Yes the editing! I can't remember if I've seen before a film editing that works this effectively in the comedy genre. It's so subtle and creative. \n\nGene Wilder did it again with his charismatic and charming performance that must play a vital role in making the audience riveted whatever the movie he is in.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some jokes that didn't land. Mostly because they were repetitive. Although they worked at the first time, they lost their sharpness and effectiveness very quickly, maybe even at the second time they were repeated. The rest of the jokes that didn't hit the mark, which is quite few, were just because I didn't find them funny.\n\nI think Young Frankenstein is a very funny and unique comedy, and if I may choose between the two Mel Brooks films that have been released that year, Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles, I would choose Young Frankenstein.\n\n(8/10)",

The opening scene where he starts ranting at a student in his class was great! One of my favorite aspects was how Wilder and Marty Feldman played off each other. That kind of silly banter is totally my kind of comedy. \"There wolf\" is such a stupid joke but I was laughing so hard. \n\nThere's lots of other great performances by amazing actors in this movie.

When I saw Gene Wilder's passing, I felt like watching one of his well known films which is this, which when I first saw this movie, I thought it was boring and but only have some chuckle moments, but I was at my teen years at the time, so I wasn't quite getting a grasp of Mel Brooks films. So at second viewing, this is a lot better than I first saw of it. Gene Wilder is great for being the straight man, but when he goes insane, it's a lot of fun to watch. It has a cameo by Gene Hackman who is known for his serious and villainous roles, and he's probably one of the funniest parts of the film. I was relived to see that I didn't need to watch the original film in order to understand the jokes in this as I'm assuming that the serious parts that were in the original film were played in a comedic way that doesn't make fun of the film that was making a parody of. The jokes really work in a very silly way, and the characters are very memorable in a way that they are very funny. It does show that they are making this as a bit of a tribute to the original film as they care very much about it, and probably wanted to be similar to the movie.

The other stand-out from the cast is Marty Feldman as Igor (pronounced eye-gor) who is essentially the embodiment of an internet troll, constantly challenging Frankenstein's methods and breaking the fourth wall repeatedly. It's a gag-filled film throughout and I feel it hits more than misses, especially during a random encounter between the Monster and a blind, old man played surprisingly by Gene Hackman that used physical comedy flawlessly!

Still, Young Frankenstein is incredibly fun and delivers a lot of laughs.",

What makes them great can be summed up in one word: Love. It's strange to think about, but the best film spoofs are a built on an inherent love and understanding of what's being skewered. So it's no surprise in some ways that Young Frankenstein is Mel Brooks' greatest film. The amount of referential material in this film goes far beyond the knowledge of even some seasoned film geeks (there is a Frankenstein film that features a police inspector that has a wooden arm, and yes, he plays darts with Dr. Frankenstein). Even the equipment in this film's lab is taken from the Boris Karloff classic. Combine this reverence with one of Gene Wilder's greatest performances, jokes that absolutely hit their mark, and gorgeous atmosphere from black and white cinematography, and you have a comedy classic. One of the greatest of all time and highly recommended.",

What Mel Brooks does was perfected in Young Frankenstein and it proves that his kind of humor can work when it's done right. It just seems like he put a lot of thought into this one, where his other movies it seems like the first joke to pop into his head is what he'd use no matter how unfunny it might be. Kind of like the Roger Corman of spoof movies. \n\nI always found it odd that the spoof genre is so absurd you'd think it would be the easiest to write for, but so many of them fail.

Rather than throwing out joke after joke on a variety of horror subjects, Mel Brooks and Writer/Star Gene Wilder keeps it based on the story of Frankenstein. Young Frankenstein is essentially a version of that story. \nGene Wilder is great as the shouting mad scientist and delivers the jokes with ease. Peter Boyle makes the most of what he can as the monster. Cloris Leachman is fun to watch but not in the film enough. However, she does have some of the best scenes. The highlight out of all the characters is Marty Feldman as Igor. He has the look for the character and the voice that you don't expect. He is given some of the best jokes, and the way he connects to the audience by talking to them works well. There is also a nice little cameo from Gene Hackman.\nIt also helps Brooks to be given equipment from the original Frankenstein film to use. Along with the well crafted sets, you are given a Frankenstein film that feels authentic. The use of filming it in black and white gives it that extra layer. \nWhilst the film contains some good jokes, a lot of them are based on the Universal horror film series. This means that some of the humour can be lost on the audience. You also have to be paying attention as some jokes could fly straight past you without realising. It wasn't until reading through the quotes after that I could appreciate some of the one liners I missed. Still, two of the best sequences (the charades and the performance) should be found funny to anyone who isn't familiar with the movies.\nWhilst I personally didn't find it to be Mel Brook's best comedy, it is still a solid affair. Unfortunately, I find that the film would only gain a particular audience based on their past viewing history.",

Wilder keeps the satire in sharp focus, allowing the silliest of jokes to remain in line with the  homage/parody of classic horror movies. The results hit far more often than miss, but there are so many great jokes that the misses may actually be weaker hits. Flawless recreation of 1930s cinematography / score / lighting, used for both jarringly funny jokes and plot development (ex. The mysterious violin we had assumed was just the score). Awesome use of editing to pack greater punches in the jokes. JOKE SPOILER: The best example of this is the sexual \"tension\" between Dr. Frunkunshteen (Gene Wilder) and his assistant Inga (Teri Garr). For most of the film, it seems entirely one-sided, Inga reading everything that the Doctor says in a sexual way. Near the end of the movie, Inga continues to flirt, only for the Doctor to have a seemingly non-sexual revelation. (Like, dude, how are you NOT seeing this?) Cut to next scene in an empty laboratory, when innocuous dialogue is traded while the camera slowly pans to the Doctor and Inga naked under the covers. So wonderful. Gosh, the acting, too. Gene Wilder may have the most screen time, but this feels much more like an ensemble work. Peter Boyle as the Monster, Marty Feldman as Igor, Madeline Kahn as Elizabeth the eventual Bride of the Monster, Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher (NNNNEEEEIIIIGGHGHHBBRBRRB), even a cameo from Gene Hackman, pretty famous at the time for his starring role in The French Connection, as a Transylvanian blind man looking for a friend to share soup, cigars, and espresso with. It's easier to appreciate Young Frankenstein if you have seen films like, duh, Frankenstein, but the jokes in this parody are aplenty and so tangible that it well stands the test of time. Even the \"Puttin' on the Ritz\" routine, thanks to Peter Boyle's autistic enthusiasm for singing and dancing. You laugh with him, not at him -- Key to a fantastic parody.",

There he meets I-gor (played hysterically by googly-eyed Marty Feldman) and Inga his assistant (played by Teri Garr). Peter Boyle steals the show as the Monster he creates- who could forget his rendition of \"Putting on the Ritz\"?

Even if not riotously funny, this is comedy with dog ears, stained pages in a schoolboy joke book that Brooks elevates not only to the big screen and brings to an audience, but like the best of his work it's a welcome cheer to the fact that THIS can be a profession, and that with a little risk, creativity and BALLS -- what knockers! -- pop culture is never really dead -- it's just always waiting to be brought back to life.",

The thing is, he wants nothing to do with his infamous relative, even going so far as pronouncing his name differently. However, when he inherits the family estate he must face his ancestry head on. There temptation takes over and he begins to build a creature of his very own, with horrifyingly funny results. This film has memorable moments including \"Putting on the Ritz\" and the Inspector's arm. I still cannot believe that Feldman's eyes get that big either! Wow.",
