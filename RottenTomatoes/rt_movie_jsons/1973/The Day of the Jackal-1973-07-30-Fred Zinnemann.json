Edward Fox as the Cha Cal, and Micheal Lonsdale as Lebel have given their best performances.  A movie not to be missed.  The novel, The Day of The Jackal by Frederick Forsyth is gripping and the movie did full justice.",

            "content": "The Day of the Jackal distinguishes itself among Cold War era espionage/hunted criminal flicks through its continued focus on Fox's titular antagonist, creating a dangerous, refined, capable air about him that establishes the film's atmosphere far more substantially than the actual threat that he poses in the assassination of de Gaulle. He brings a sense of remorseless professionalism that you can't help but be engrossed by; the film chooses this as his defining feature, as the man changes names, mannerisms, and personalities to fit a given situation, going so far as to dedicate the final scene to reinforcing that his actual identity is unknowable, reducing him to bare essentials. Lebel, the character that most closely resembles a conventional protagonist, is introduced shockingly late in the film, but he exists less to provide a fixed point for the audience to support than as a necessary foil for the Jackal, and it is as much luck that prevents the crime from being carried out as much as it is Lebel's capability. The film feels tight and generally moves quickly, but certainly lacks some of the action elements that would define a comparable film released today. Still, there are points where the film does date itself somewhat, as with a government official exaggeratedly slapping himself on the forehead in disbeief and the Jackal's deadly karate-chop takedowns; the length can be a bit of a limiting factor as well. I do enjoy the occasional 'less is more' tactics that the film takes, such as with the last line between the Jackal and his gunsmith consisting of the former asking him to hand him one of the prepared bullets, allowing the implication to carry the scene's conclusion. (4/5)",

Edward Fox, with cool detachment, plays The Jackal, a mysterious and diligent hitman hired to do the killing.  The film, shot in an almost documentary style, shows the preparation for the murder in meticulous and ruthless detail.  One drawback is the supporting cast who, regardless of their nationality, seem to converse in a variety of English accents, which can be confusing, if not outright confounding, at times.",

When I first borrowed this film, I mistook it for a British war film about a big-nosed colonel sending his troops on a suicide mission!\nBoy was I wrong.\nIt's actually about a British assassin (The Jackal) hired by the right-wing French dissident paramilitary organization OAS to kill the president of France.\nMaybe I should read the blurb next time.\nRegardless of my little misconception, the thriller pays of its 2½ runtime with plenty of vulgar violence, subtle sex and inhumane-watermelon-handling. It's a film consisting of two long segments (either The Jackal killing innocents OR the French police tracking him down), each cut up into dozens of LITTLER segments and painstaking placed in-between one another (fig 1). That, my friend, makes the perfect cult thriller. And that's what this is — a 70s cult classic gem!\nThere is A LOT of silence and even MORE karate chops to the neck, but it all adds to the relentless tension that builds up in the background, bubbling throughout.\nUndeniably, the entire film feels like a low key James Bond film, thanks to Austrian-born American director Fred Zinnemann. Nobody really talks about it, but it's obviously a foreign parallel. Unlike 007 though, the Jackal is a less wealthy figure = gets his hands dirtier, and doesn't work for Her Majesty's Secret Service.\nOn that note (unless it's been burned already lol), I think I'll wrap up by saying that this is a good movie about bad people which I think you'd enjoy if that's your kind of thing. Much of the film's charm is kudos to the knockout performance (no pun intended) by Edward Fox and a pigeon-poo performance is given by Michael Lonsdale (I'm joking) who plays bird-keeper Lebel.\nNow I need to read the book!\n\nfig 1).

            "content": "Riveting and complex!\n\nFred Zinnemann's crime thriller The Day of the Jackal (1973) sees the audience following both a contract killer plotting the assassination of the French president as well as the entire law enforcement investigation into catching the hitman. Zinnemann's direction is absolutely fantastic as you are engrossed by an intricate narrative with impressive detail as he forces the viewer to keep guessing. Zinnemann runs you around Europe as you witness all the government and policemen track down an evasive shooter for hire calling himself The Jackal. Stunning cinematography flows effortlessly across France, England, and more European countries with striking wide shots of streets, rooms, and buildings wherein anyone can hide. You are so held in suspense by the fact that anything can happen during The Day of the Jackal that the film's steady pace makes it go by in a moment.\n\nThere's hardly any music in the background of The Day of the Jackal, so that you focus in on character interactions and little details immediately. The fast paced editing sends you from one place to another in seconds, but you are always aware of what is happening. It's impressive that The Day of the Jackal was written by one man as the script is so tight, so detailed, and so complex that you can imagine 100 writers could have contributed all the small details of detective work police do to hunt down threats.\n\nEdward Fox is phenomenal as the nuanced killer The Jackal. He is calm, suave, cunning, and quick with an intimidating penchant for the deadly. Fox is fun to watch plan out his mark with professional precision as he trots across Europe heading to his final lethal encounter.\n\nI really enjoyed Derek Jacobi as the young Inspector Caron. Olga Georges-Picot is sympathetic and intriguing as the informant spy Denise. I thought Michael Lonsdale was inspired as the sure fire detective Claude Lebel. He is intelligent, clever, thoughtful, resourceful, and unassuming as the hero of the story. Lastly, I adored the alluring performance from the actress Delphine Seyrig. She is charming and playful with an intriguing sense of self. She's a wonderful momentary foil for Fox's Jackal.\n\nIn conclusion, Fred Zinnemann's thriller The Day of the Jackal is a suspenseful masterpiece of renowned precision. It's as cool as thrillers get.",

On the other hand we follow the crew after him. They are professionals and the cat and mouse game is a huge effort.\n\nI dig the development as the assassin get's ready. He is contacting fellas for weapons and fake IDs. He tries out guns and he does some neccessary kills now and then. I kind of like the guy. The good guys is also cool guys. Smoking a lot of cigarettes, staying up making unplesant, but important phonecalls around the globe. I really dig Michael Lonsdale's performance as Lebel - great effort.\n\nA long film, but very rewarding and never boring.

While the coverage of the Jackal himself is interesting, what rounds it off perfectly is the police angle.  We see the investigations, on both sides of the English Channel, the ingenious hypotheses and cross-examination of data and the painstaking grunt work.\n\nDirector Fred Zinneman also builds the tension well and the conclusion is not at all predictable.  \n\nAdd in a decidedly unglamourous lead detective, Commissioner Lebel, and you have a very plausible, gritty, accurate-feeling movie.

That aside, the performances were good enough that they lift the movie from the level of total tedium. The production values are also very good for the time, even though the majority of the film's colour palette seems to be composed principally of muted colours. Fortunately for me, the film wasn't just two-and-a-half hours of silence, though to be honest, the film could have used a little more action.

Zinnemann's low-key approach is a textbook example of how to make an exciting and sophisticated suspense film without relying on overblown action sequences or flashy visual effects. Zinnemann establishes a pace that is deliberate, but never boring.\n\nAn underground terrorist group in France, the OAS, decide to hire a professional killer to assassinate French President Charles De Gaulle (Adrien Cayla-Legrand) after their previous attempts have failed. Their next move is to hire a professional assassin, an English hit man responsible for several high-profile assassinations. Charles Calthrop (Edward Fox) accepts the contract to assassinate the President, and takes on the alias of  'Jackal'. The Jackal methodically prepares to put his plan into action: gathering a new identity, collecting forged documents and a French passport, and finally a custom-built rifle. Top French police investigator Lebel (Michel Lonsdale) learns the name 'Jackal' from an informer in the plotter's ranks and cleverly pieces together the identity of the killer-for-hire.\n\nAs with all good thrillers, it's the chase leading up to the climactic finale that is the best part of watching the plot unfold. In relating its tense tale of political wrangling, the intricate and meticulous story develops with a parallel structure that details the Jackal's preparations for the assassination, and Lebel's ongoing efforts to stop him. Fox is superb as the coldly impassioned assassin, and Lonsdale is magnificently analytical as the obsessive detective tracking him down. Despite its measured pace, the tension slowly mounts as the Jackal closes in on his high value target, and the authorities pull out all the stops to find him first. A taut, fascinating, and timeless political thriller.",

            "content": "A police procedural in the guise of a political thriller, \"Day of the Jackal\" is impressively-detailed but more restrained than many of its peers.  Star power and the promise of intense action took its genre cousins \"The French Connection\" and \"Three Days of the Condor,\" for example, to $40-50 million finishes in 1971 and 1975, respectively, but the slower-boiling \"Jackal\" barely broke $16 million.  In quality of production, \"Jackal\" excels but seems to hearken back.  It has the feel of an early 1960s film (and since it is set in 1963 that is appropriate), with the clothes and the cinematography and even the posh European setting all feeling right for a slick actioner of that era.  The plot follows detectives and assassins, the first always half a step behind the second, but there is none of that stuff called \"grit\" that defines so many crime and espionage movies from the 1970s onward.  Everything is in broad daylight, beautifully-shot with the smooth, washed-out look of director Zinnemann's other color productions like \"Julia\" (1977) and \"A Man for All Seasons\" (1966), and the necessary violence is handled perfunctorily and virtually bloodlessly.  Nobody shouts, the one car crash is an accidental fender-bender, and when a French minister is implicated in an embarrassing security breach in the middle of a briefing he quietly apologizes and excuses himself.  Nobody makes a scene.  The decision to go with a low-key script is interesting, especially since the audience presumably knows that President Charles de Gaulle was not the victim of assassination and therefore knows from the beginning how the main plot will end.  But the strength of a procedural, as opposed to a thriller, is not always in tension but in detail and the depiction of characters, and in these respects Zinnemann is master.",

The story is based on the novel with the same name, which has integrated a lot of real French history into the fictional story, for example the OAS and their true intent to murder De Gaulle, this adds a lot of credibility to the plot. Edward Fox does an outstanding job playing the ice-cold professional killer known as The Jackal and so does Michel Lonsdale who plays investigator Lebel, my only complaint is that that to little screen-time is spent familiarising the viewer with this character. The film is essentially a cat and mouse chase between the two in which The Jackal always seems to be one step ahead. A classic film that I would strongly recommend for all fans of thrillers.",

While perhaps not his greatest film - in that the story is told for the story's own sake, possessing few (if any) of the deeply fascinating philosophical, ethical or theological implications many of his other works hold - it is certainly his most perfect,  with every scene cut and shot exquisitely and Edward Fox delivering a truly chilling performance as a ruthless assassin, who disguises his cold blooded nature behind a veneer of English charm and sophistication. There are complaints that it is long and boring, but honestly, I could not disagree more. The suspense is taught, the story brilliantly engaging - from one of the greatest literary thrillers of all time comes one of the greatest cinematic thrillers of all time.

The assassin goes through great lengths in order to fulfill his contract; he orders a bespoke rifle, changes his identity twice, murders an innocent woman that he wooed in the first place, kills another man he met at a turkish bath (wtf?), masquerades as an old military veteran in order to pass through security. Seriously, does he really have to go through all these uncessarily complicated steps in order to kill a static target surrounded by so many tall buildings in the center of Paris?

We get to see what precision he has resorted to in order to make his assassination not just successful, but untraceable. And although not successful, in the end we realize that it IS untraceable - note the final words (\"But if the Jackal wasn't Calthrop, then who the hell was he?\") spoken over the scene of his (plain) burial. His real name is never revealed, so he just appears in the beginning and just dies at the end. That's it - no family, no background, nothing at all. Which is not to say that this is boring or tedious - quite the contrary, like a Hitchcock thriller, it's predictable but suspenseful. Fred Zinnemann was known previously for his epics, and he shines in this thriller. This film is sure to keep you on the edge of the seats, provided you're intelligent enough to keep up with its beautiful pace, and provided of course you DON'T regard it as uninteresting (because, in the end, it's anything BUT).",

Rodin: Will you do it? \r\nThe Jackal: Yes. \r\nMontclair: How much? \r\nThe Jackal: You must understand that this is a once-in-a-lifetime job, whoever does it can never work again... \r\nMontclair: How much do you want? \r\nThe Jackal: Half a million. \r\nMontclair: What? \r\nThe Jackal: In cash. Half now, half on completion. \r\nMontclair: Half a million francs? \r\nThe Jackal: Dollars. \r\nMontclair: [standing up] Are you mad? \r\nThe Jackal: Considering you expect to get France in return, I'd have thought it a reasonable price. If you can't do it, then there's nothing more to be said. \r\n[turns to leave] \r\nCol. Rodin: We accept! \r\n\r\n\r\nMinister: There is one thing: how did you know whose telephone to tap? \r\nLebel: I didn't, so I tapped all of them. \r\n\r\n\r\nMallinson: The prime minister? \r\nInsp. Thomas: The prime minster, sir. That he said if there's the remotest possibility of General de Gaulle's life being threatened by a person of these islands, then it is to be stopped. And he's given me full powers and top priority. \r\nMallinson: Is this some kind of bloody joke? \r\nInsp. Thomas: No, of couse not, sir. I've got to drop whatever I'm doing, and I shall need six of your best men, straight away. \r\nMallinson: Where's the notification for all this? Where's the proper authority? \r\n[Telephone rings. Mallison answers] \r\nMallinson: Yes! \r\n[Mallison listens then rises] \r\nMallinson: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Of course, sir. \r\n\r\n\r\nColette de Montpelier: Why, I don't know what you're talking about. \r\nLebel: Madam, be in no doubt as to the seriousness of your position. \r\n[Colette stands and moves uneasily to another chair] \r\n\r\n\r\nCol. Rodin: We are not terrorists, you understand. We are patriots. Our duty is to the soldiers who died fighting in Algeria, and to the three million French citizens who have always lived there. \r\nThe Jackal: And so you want to get rid of him. \r\nCol. Rodin: Speaking as a professional, do you think it's possible? \r\nThe Jackal: It's possible. The point is getting away with it. And speaking as a professional, that's a very important consideration. \r\nMontclair: But in principle you say it could be done? \r\nThe Jackal: Yes, with enough time and planning. It would be more difficult than most other targets. \r\nCasson: Why more? \r\nThe Jackal: Because de Gaulle has the best security service in the world. Their information is first-class. You see, gentlemen, not only have your own efforts failed, but you've rather queered the pitch for everyone else. \r\nCasson: How dare you suggest that! \r\nThe Jackal: In this work, you simply can't afford to be emotional. That's why you've made so many mistakes. \r\nCol. Rodin: But if we decided to employ a professional... \r\nThe Jackal: You have to employ a professional. Your organization is so riddled with informers that nothing you decide is a secret for long. No, the job would have to be done by an outsider. The only question would be by whom, and for how much. \r\n\r\n\r\nCaron: You know, sir, what they'll do to you if you don't catch this man in time... \r\nLebel: I've been given a job to do, so we'll just have to do it. \r\nCaron: But no crime has been committed yet, so where are we supposed to start looking for the criminal? \r\nLebel: We start by recognizing that, after De Gaulle, we are the two most powerful people in France. \r\n\r\n\r\nInsp. Thomas: [after Special Branch Detective finds Charles Calthrop's passport in his apartment] What's this? \r\nSpecial Branch Detective: His passport. \r\nInsp. Thomas: Oh? \r\nSpecial Branch Detective: We checked it. It's him, all right. Look. The Dominican visa. There's no exit stamp, though. He must have got out on the sly. \r\nInsp. Thomas: You haven't grasped it yet, have you? Oh, yes, this is our man, all right. Definitely. But hasn't it occurred to you that we're holding his passport in our hands? If he is out of the country, what's he travelling on? Eh? \r\n\r\n\r\nLebel: Excuse me, but it has just occurred to me that we have forty-eight hours in which to find this Jackal \r\n[There is a chorus of \"What?\" and \"How do you know?\" from the committee members] \r\nLebel: Am I right in assuming that the President has no engagements outside the Elysee Palace today, tomorrow and Saturday ? \r\nMinister: None. \r\nLebel: And what is Sunday, August the twenty-fifth? \r\nMinister: [Slaps forehead] Of course! Liberation Day! \r\nLebel: That's what he's been waiting for. \r\nMinister: We must have been blind. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gunsmith: Over what range will you fire? \r\nThe Jackal: I'm not sure yet but probably not more than 400 feet \r\nThe Gunsmith: Will the gentleman be moving? \r\nThe Jackal: Stationary. \r\nThe Gunsmith: Will you go for a head shot or a chest shot? \r\nThe Jackal: Probably head. \r\nThe Gunsmith: What about the chance of a second shot? \r\nThe Jackal: Well I might get the chance but I doubt it. In any event I'll need a silencer to escape. \r\nThe Gunsmith: In that case you'd better have explosive bullets. I can prepare a handful along with the gun. \r\nThe Jackal: Glycerin or mercury? \r\nThe Gunsmith: Oh mercury... much cleaner. \r\n\r\n\r\nValmy: [answers phone] Hello? \r\nDenise: Denise. \r\nValmy: Valmy here. \r\nDenise: They found out about the Jackal. \r\n\r\n\r\n[arriving in St Clair's home] \r\nDenise: Are you home already...? \r\n[discovers St Clair's body and a bottle of pills] \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Interrogator: You're being very foolish, Victor. You know yourself, they always talk in the end. You've seen it with your own two eyes in... where was it, Indochina? And Algeria, of course. Why don't you tell us what they're waiting for in that hotel, eh? Rodin, Montclair, Casson: what are they planning, who have they been meeting? Nobody? Not a soul, hmm? Then where were they before they went to Rome, eh? Tell us, Victor. \r\n\r\n\r\nLebel: The following conversation was recorded at 6:15 this morning. The number being dialed was identified as Molitor 5901. \r\n[plays a tape recorder for the council] \r\nDenise: Hello. \r\nValmy: Yes? \r\nDenise: Denise. \r\nValmy: Valmy here. \r\nDenise: They know he's a Danish schoolteacher. They're visiting every hotel in Paris. \r\n[Lebel switches off the recorder] \r\nLebel: The contact was arrested an hour ago. Unfortunately, the information came from this room. \r\nMinister: Whose voice was that? \r\nSt. Clair: [slowly rises] I regret to have to inform you, Minister, that it was the voice of a friend of mine... she is staying with me at the moment... excuse me. \r\n[leaves] \r\nMinister: I feel we owe you an apology, Commissioner. \r\nLebel: Thank you. \r\n\r\n\r\nCasson: No wonder our people are giving up, they've lost faith! \r\nMontclair: We've failed them every single time! \r\nCol. Rodin: We won't fail them again! \r\nCasson: What can we do? We're paralyzed! \r\nMontclair: Every cop in France has memorized our faces! Informants are all around us! \r\nCol. Rodin: ...We must find an outsider. A foreigner! \r\nMontclair: A foreigner? Why? \r\nCol. Rodin: A contract killer! He won't have a record inside France, so he won't exist; he can come and go as he pleases! \r\nMontclair: That sort of person costs money. \r\nCol. Rodin: Yes. I'll find the right man.",

It's an ultimate Thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I could easily compare this to the Bourne Movies. But this movie stands in a class by itself. Edward Fox is awesome as the Jackal. The OAS seek to assassinate French President Charles de Gaulle due to the fact that he decided to give Algeria it's independence. After a failed coup, the OAS hire the help of an English Assassin to carry out de Gaulle's demise. Edward Fox delivers something so unique on screen that every time he's on screen, he almost believe he's a cold blooded killer. This film should have further'd Fox's career. He's only  played in a handful of films since. Despite this, He was phenomenal in this film, and he is an underrated talent.  The Day Of The Jackal is a solidly paced Thriller. Not many films have succeeded in offering something this thrilling, and this film remains in a league of it's own as one of the greatest Thriller films ever made. This film is highly suspenseful from the first jaw dropping five minutes of the film to the exhilarating climax, this film is a smartly crafted film that has an outstanding cast.  Director Fred Zinnermann has done a masterful job at adapting Frederick Forsyth's masterwork of pulse pounding thrills. Aside from a few changes, this adaptation is very faithful to the book, and it's just as exciting as the book. So if you're planning on renting this film, be prepared to view one of the greatest Thriller films ever made, not many have come close to this classic. You will be wowed at how great this film is.",

If you compare to \"The Jackal\" with Bruce Willis, where he made a huge weapon that fires projectiles as big as a pen, and it's fired by remote control, you'll see that simplistic and effective plans can be way better than the sophisticated ones.\r\n\r\n While watching The Jackal's preparation to the attack, I couldn't take my eyes of the screen, it's interesting and entertaing to watch, everything is very well explained, for example, throughout the movie The Jackal uses four different passports, and you know exactly when and where he's changing his indentity.\r\n\r\n Verdict: With simple, but brilliant plot and direction, this movie has something different than the others cat and mouse movies.",

The movie has a very handsome look with terrific shots of Paris and Italy. The lead actors, Edward Fox and Michael Lonsdale, are actors that are rarely seen by American audiences which I thought helped the viewer really get into the suspense of the film. This is unquestionably Edward Fox's most memorable performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n100%\r\n Zinneman is a three time Oscar winner - twice for best director, once for best documentary short subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n80%\r\n Just re-watched and this movie is as fresh today as when it was made with many of the same conventions movies use now, very modern.\r\n\r\n\r\n80%\r\n This well made and fully engaging 70s thriller has fantastic performances, a twisting and interesting plot, decent action and a taut ending.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlot:\r\n\r\nA professional assassin code named \"Jackal\" plots to kill Charles de Gaulle, the President of France.\r\n\r\n\r\nStoryline\r\nIt is the early 60s in France. The remaining survivors of the aborted French Foreign Legion have made repeated attempts to kill DeGaulle. The result is that he is the most closely guarded man in the world. As a desperate act, they hire The Jackal, the code name for a hired killer who agrees to kill French President De Gaulle for half a million dollars. We watch his preparations which are so thorough we wonder how he could possibly fail even as we watch the French police attempt to pick up his trail. The situation is historically accurate. There were many such attempts and the film closely follows the plot of the book.\r\n Written by John Vogel   \r\n\r\nDirector: Fred Zinnemann\r\nWriters: Frederick Forsyth (book), Kenneth Ross (screenplay)\r\nStars: Edward Fox, Terence Alexander and Michel Auclair\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\nRuntime: 143 min\r\nSound Mix: Mono (Westrex Recording System)\r\nColor: Color (Technicolor)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT9VxVmHgaCY6BigADv0aNdTyIwHE4Y5hr66OqbQgzF8fK7EeQz[/img]",

Almost completely devoid of dialogue the scenes portray visually more story than most modern thrillers can fit into two hours. This is about the best book-to-film conversion I've ever seen. The cuts, where they are made, are logical and some locations are combined. From Forsyth's first, and probably best book (written in less than 5 weeks) this film contains nothing that does not drive the story forward. The character of the Jackal is brilliantly finely drawn. He doesn't contain any of the cliches that you would expect to see in a film written in the last twenty years (he doesn't display mental instability, or have flashbacks to some event in his past). He never tries to justify his pernicious occupation to anyone yet, strangely, doesn't come across as an evil man. Simply as a professional doing his job. The French police inspector is wonderfully underplayed and is as far away from the he-breaks-the-rules-but-he-gets-the-job-done cliche as you can possibly imagine. He is first seen attending to his pigeons and upon being told he is being put on the case simply says \"Oh God...\"....\n\nZimmemann's direction is great and the scenes are beautifully photographed - particularly in Paris.\n\nThis is an all-time great film. Definitely in my top ten. I suppose I must put something in negative so it makes for a balanced review so errr.... I think the French minister is wearing a very bad wig. Beyond that -marvelous.",

What unfolds is a game of cat and mouse with the suspense building to a thrilling climax. \r\n\r\nEdward Fox is The Jackal and plays the part remarkably well. Cold, calculating, cunning and a bit suave he plots each an devery move and when things get messed up a bit by the police and intelligence services he remains cool and improvises around the situation. It's very well done. \r\n\r\nThe locations also make the movie with some very stately images of Rome, Genoa, Paris, Austria and of course London. \r\n\r\nRight up to the credits rolling The Day of the Jackal will keep you on the edge of your seat, guessing, wondering just who is the Jackal.  \r\n\r\nIf you like political intrigue thrillers then they hardly come any better than The Day of the Jackal.",

I have tried other 1960s/1970s-era spy films and had not liked them...The Spy Who Came In From the Cold, The Odessa File, etc. When this Fred Zimmemann film came on cable one night, I begrudgingly thought I would give it a go, but expected I?d be turning it off quickly. I didn?t. I was totally engrossed in the story and captivated by the inner workings of the main characters.

The funniest thing about this plot is that this cabal actually existed; it was called the OAS; they actually did try to kill de Gaulle in 1962. This film is about a fictitious second attempt on de Gaulle's life after the failure of the first attempt.\r\n\r\nProblems with this film:\r\n1.) French characters speak English with each other. This is one of my pet peeve. It annoys me every time I see a film made in English that includes characters who would not have spoken English in real life.\r\n2.) The police are constantly just one step behind the assassin. The man was supposed to be the best professional killer in the world, and yet he only narrowly avoids the police several times.\r\n3.) The allegedly best detective in France is a humble grey middle aged bureaucrat who has never been assigned to such high-profile cases before, and yet his superiors are somehow aware of his superhuman capabilities, as if finding the assassin somehow depended on this one man alone.\r\n4.) The assassin is supposed to kill de Gaulle on 14th of July, the national day, when there are thousands of armed policemen and soldiers in the immediate vicinity of the president because of the military parades in Paris. Surely a professional assassin would have chosen a better day to kill the president, i.e. basically any other day of the year.",

What makes this film superior to the toothless remake is that it relies on a minimalist approach on the thriller genre, where original soundtracks are close to nil, and the movie jumps between the two simultaneous plots of both the antagonist and protagonist. Michael Lonsdale and Edward Fox offered superb performances on this fictitious take on a real-life assassination attempt of Gen. De Gaulle.

Fortunately these deliver (although for such a consummate professional I found one or two of the Jackal's decisions questionable to say the least), with Edward Fox and Michel Lonsdale an excellent pairing as the top men in their respective fields, each desperately trying to outwit the other in a race against time. Not fully deserving of classic status for me, but a quality thriller nonetheless.",

Badel is great as a subtly Colombo-type figure.",

See it and skip the Bruce Willis one. A cheap re-make.",
