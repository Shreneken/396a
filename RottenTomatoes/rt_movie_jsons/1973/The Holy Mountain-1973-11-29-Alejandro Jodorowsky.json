The numerous famous scenes, eccentric, unusually colorful, erotic, gross-out, and fully materialized by the alchemy of Mr. Alexandre Jodorowsky, can sufficiently heal patients with \"mental disorders\" as \"psychotherapy\" even if there is no dialogue in them. And the film is an ensemble of images of the perverts of the earth, including sexuality, grotesqueness, sanctity, love (or abuse) of the disabled, and contempt for animals, all in one film.\nThis is not only Alejandro Jodorowsky's masterpiece, but (at least for me) I was healed by this film. It is this visual work, more than drugs or masturbation, that is the source of salvation for me. So this film is a Copernican turn in psychiatry beyond art. Thank you for saving me.

            "content": "The Holy Mountain is an exorbitant, lavish, and dense film; some people love it because of those attributes, and just as many dislike it for the same reasons. \n\nFew films seem to cater to early '70s psychidelia and alternative perspectives like this one. It's highly creative, particularly in the set design and worldbuilding that Alejandro Jodorowsky himself was largely responsible for; how many other directors would mock up a recreation of the Spanish conquest of Mexico through bearded dragons and toads, each in unique costumes with explosive effects and simulated blood? As a visual experience, it's can't-miss film, a whirlwind of practical design and intense color. However, its swirling mass of philosophical musings, religious overtones, and existential ruminations feel like the product of a drug-addled mind that considers dense questions in a superficial manner. It's weaponized surrealism, where nothing at all makes any sense and so any meaning at all can be applied to the bizarre series of sketches on screen, a cinematic mirror made to stroke the egos of critics. \n\nStill, imagining the avant garde film crowd of the ealry '70s hailing this film as a masterpiece of 'unchained thinking' is entertaining enough to make it worth a watch. (3.5/5)",

His ideas, his targets, the symbolism are generally very clear. The satirical and direct attacks/commentary on mores, religion, sexuality and the human body, and violence are repeated along with the consistent use of animals in reprehensible manner. \nYes, Jodorowsky came up with remarkable symbolic images. Yes, his movies are uniquely his own vision. But he could've been a truly visionary, transcendent filmmaker, imo. His obsessions were a very serious detraction for me. The graphically violent images along with base physical acts are too distracting and seem like something a menial brute would use. His apparent utter dismissal of any issues with violent acts towards animals and insistent use of animal corpses and even killing of animals in his movies is repugnant to me. It all takes me right out of his movies, which is not what a good director should ever want. \nToo often 'The Holy Mountain' seemed overtly sensationalist and some attempt to shock rather than create a great piece of cinematic art. Now if he wasn't such a prude about nudity. 2 stars",

            "content": "\"The holy mountain\" can not be called a movie, as it is just one giant reflection and easter egg on religions and cults as a whole. My friends who have seen it told me how gross it was, how disturbing every image is and how genius the movie actually is. I would not agree with the disturbing and gross parts, as after I have seen \"Mother!\" and \"Vivarium\" I don't think that there can be a movie more disturbing than these two. What I really didn't like about this movie, which is the reason I am giving it such a low rating is that it lacks the main character, as well as it lacks a story. It is just one giant art house, in which you don't feel anything, except for the question \"Why did I waste my time watching this?\". This movie is like a drawing on a Christie's exhibition, which has no thought behind it, but everybody is talking about it. Obviously even excrements and cutting off genital parts should mean something, but if you actually think what they should mean the answer is nothing. I am not stupid, I don't think that people who adore this movie are crazy or anything, I just think that what the director implied to do was that he would create a movie with a lot of gross and meaningless scenes, but the society will just take it in like if it is an absolute masterpiece. This movie was just made for it to be discussed. And it still is. Me and my friend, who has recommended me this film, were talking for about 3 hours on the theme of the movie. My position is really strong, I think that the first 1 hour and 40 minutes are boring. Yes, they may have some meaning behind them, like peoples sins and everything, but it's nothing but the visuals really, you only understand it after you watch the movie for a second or a third time. I have seen this movie 5 times now, and I really wish I didn't. I tried hard to find something that people love about this movie, but I found nothing except gore. The ending though, is a masterpiece, which leaves you with some thoughts to think about, but nothing else. You will only talk about this movie either as a masterpiece, either a disgrace to the cinematic world. And I am the type of person who thinks that this movie is boring, but at the same time I admire it's release date and the bravery of the director to actually put it out, as it is very VERY weird. As for me, I didn't get shocked or anything and each time I watched this film I felt like if I'm watching a 10 hour long tv show, which has no meaning, so all I've got is that this is a satire on religion, nothing else. Also, excrements turning to gold is a good satire to this movie, as it is horrible and boring, but everyone around think of it as some hidden gem masterpiece, which no one knows about.\n4/10, not 1 because of visuals and a discussion, which this film caused. I wouldn't say I don't recommend it, as you will think differently about this movie based on your preferences, but as for me, I found it hard to find why people love it, as well as I wasted 10 hours of my precious time rewatching it, very overrated art house, in my opinion.",

As I have heard about this movie in the pass I was curious, so I went down the rabbit hole that is this movie. On this episode of where the pandemic sent me/what to watch is the movie The Holy Mountain. Well holy moly The Holy Mountain, the director/writer must have been on some kind of drugs or maybe some kind of crazy disorder to come up with this movie. Can come off offensive most of the time with some really weird images and stuff that happens throughout the movie. Very little dialogue but when the characters speak it is odd sayings etc... If I have to say one nice thing about this movie is at the end I liked the message of killing your past etc... about coming to reality I think I and others need this small message in this very odd/strange movie somehow. 1 star for this movie I guess you like it or you hate it/or don't understand it maybe if you are under some drug or spell lol you'll get this movie idk man about this movie lol. ‚õ∞üëÄüòï",

            "content": "This has very little in common with the novel it's \"based on,\" Mount Analogue, left unfinished by French writer Rene Daumal when he died of tuberculosis. Oddly, that unexpected ending ended up fitting the idea of the story perfectly, which is some of why, short as it is, it's consistently ranked in the top 100 French novels. (I highly recommend it, in English or French. But if you're reading it in English, seek out the translation by Roger Shattock. The book's tone is difficult to translate. It's actually a lot like The Little Prince... childlike. Shattock does the next best thing; knowing the author and associated spiritual stuff, he tweaks the style just slightly so it works wonderfully in English.) The only intersection between that novel and this film, as far as I can see, is the assembling of an expedition team in the beginning, and some sort of mountain at the end. The end of the \"story,\" if you can call it that, reflects the death of Rene Daumal in one of the most intensely surreal meditations on mortality and death ever filmed. Truth be told, most people probably won't enjoy the experience, but this has a lot to do with the original sense of surrealism, which is all about twisting and looping your logical expectations. See the Bunuel/Dali short film Un Chien Andalou, which kicked this off in film. If you're like many people, including me, the bizarreness and randomness can even make you feel angry. After seeing Un Chien Andalou, I was seething on the inside. I wanted to like it, I loved surreal stuff and Dali, and that sequence of images made me so genuinely angry, I almost hated the film. But then I realized that was the point. It worked. Some normal voice in you feels tricked or cheated, mocked. Surrealism in its primordial form has a lot in common with the punk movement. It's angry and it needs you to feel the rebellion. And here that really works. Images of the messiah blend with images of mannequins. Tarot imagery is under the surface somewhere, supplying unlikely connections. (The director Jodorowsky is an expert on tarot who later wrote a book and co-designed a deck.) If you hate it, keep in mind that this is trying to upset the conventional, sensible part of your mind. It's trying to punch that part of your mind in the face. Anyway, this movie is extremely visually remarkable. There are images you will never forget. I have no idea how many stars to give. If you want to check out something newer with a beautiful story you can follow, Jodorowsky's Endless Poetry is great.",

However, when I have to endure a movie that falls under the surreal genre, I‚Äôll be the first to admit that I don‚Äôt get it. The frustrating thing with The Holy Mountain is that I don‚Äôt think anyone can get it. While there are moments and images that might symbolize one thing or another, every single frame of the film is so chock-full of random nonsense that it can‚Äôt all carry meaning. It‚Äôs mixing metaphors to such a degree that there isn‚Äôt any way to lock down any of them. Whatever insanity Jodorowsky came up with in his sleep-deprived and drug-addled state likely didn‚Äôt make much sense to him, so how are we supposed to gain anything from watching it. I just picture an insane man, high on LSD or mushrooms pointing to some poor production assistant and saying ‚ÄúGet me a camel immediately! This scene needs a camel! No, wait, a pelican! That‚Äôs it, a pelican! Get me a camel and a pelican!‚Äù It‚Äôs about as coherent as this sentence: Kumquat buries hot forest jab in polar bear Wednesday. There is perhaps the faintest hint of a ‚Äúplot‚Äù in The Holy Mountain, but don‚Äôt think that gets in the way of more layers of ridiculousness in each and every scene. Watching the film is like massive sensory overload, and it proved to be so irritating to me that my brain shut down and I felt something akin to boredom. Boredom mixed with a heaping helping of shame, and just a tiny dose of nausea. As my logical mind started to revolt against the onslaught of nonsense, there was one thought that stuck in my head. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking of this movie as a massive waste. Yes, a waste of my time, but also of costumes, sets, props, actors, etc. I looked at a scene with an elaborate set and couldn‚Äôt help thinking of how much effort some poor set designer had to put into creating all of it and dressing it with furniture and props for a brief scene that is totally worthless. I‚Äôd watch in horror as animals were mistreated and abused to fit this mad-man‚Äôs ‚Äúvision.‚Äù I‚Äôd see countless actors and extras baring everything and wonder why they thought this stupid production was worth it.

Jodorowsky is a wizard, a writer and a magician, until the clown the former was, now employs all this in his long, full of symbolism and beauty.\n\n\nThe scenery composition, costumes, make-up, soundtrack and photographs are impressive, the whole art direction itself is exquisite, with scenes full of life and feeling, a lot of practical effect and care in every detail to help make a film that is aesthetically pleasing. perfect, grandiose and able to convey his plurality and grandeur only visually, Jodorowsky was a costume designer, makeup artist, led the camera and even helped to build and paint sets, such care brings as a reward a timeless film that does not age or is dated, and that every decade, it looks more beautiful.\n\nSome driving aspects need to be mentioned, such as driving the camera which is used in a variety of ways, we don't have a driving continuity, the director frames as he thinks best for the scene, but his appreciation for a high camera on the crane is noticeable, which helps to further beautify your scenery and photography, clear with perfect lighting, a soundtrack that follows the same logic, which brings rock and pop but focuses mainly on a classical and oriental musicality, further loading the mystical tone of the work, The montage features three well-defined acts, although the first two serve as a presentation, which is unusual, but it works, and the film never tires.\nEven in terms of acting, the great highlight is Jodorowsky, with his mystical character, the \"Alchemist\" that serves as the guiding thread that permeates the whole work, although the whole cast is good and fulfills its role well.\n\n\"The Sacred Mountain\" is not a movie for everyone, magical movie fans worship it, extreme movie worshipers see its beauty, but to please all audiences, the long forties will not, given its strangeness that at the time had displeased enough, and today, it must be even more displeasing, yet Jodorowsky's magical cinema is beautiful, beyond two hours long, its cinematic experience, messages and direction preach true immortality through the decades of cinema, a beautiful and complete work that breathes and exudes Audiovisual and is the face of rebel and transgressor cinema of the 70s.

Alejandro Jodorwosky said he wanted to create a psychedelic experience without the audience having to take any drugs. The first impression many people get from watching Alejandro Jodorowsky films is he is deranged, but after watching his movies attentively you start to realize he is presenting humanity through a pure perspective and he is actually the sane one and humanity is deranged. Great film for its shock value and symbolic art which has the ability to transform lives. It's changed mine and helped me grasp what can be possible in film. Have watched many times.",

            "content": "Bless Alejandro Jodorowsky for being so in touch with the idiosyncrasies of his boundless imagination.  For being so candid with his views on political radicalism, militarism, consumerism, sexual exploitation, and religious fanaticism; for so supplely blurring the lines between the beautiful and the grotesque, the dramatic and the ironically comedic.  For making \"The Holy Mountain,\" an artistically revolutionary masterpiece pioneering in its surrealism, its ideas, and its cinematic breakthroughs.\n\tCome 1973 and Jodorowsky had become one of the most exciting new filmmakers to pique the interests of the more adventurous of cinephiles.  His 1970 classic, \"El Topo,\" warped the insides of the western and metamorphosed it into something philosophical and psychedelic - a game-changer both intellectually and visually, it became a target of ecstatic word-of-mouth on the underground film circuit, made fans out of John Lennon and George Harrison, and turned Jodorowsky into a cult sensation.\n\tBut upon \"The Holy Mountain's\" highly anticipated premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, the hype surrounding Jodorowsky all but dissipated.  Cutting twenty minutes from its run time to eliminate as much dialogue as possible, reviews of the movie were mixed and therefore kept Jodorowsky trapped in the same cultish bubble he found himself in after \"El Topo's\" initial release.  Post-Cannes, the film still did decently well - it was an immensely popular midnight movie, playing for sixteen months straight following its 1973 showcasing at the Waverly - but today is \"The Holy Mountain\" better looked at as a forgotten masterwork, an overlooked provocateur of the celluloid never to be untangled but always mystified and maybe even repulsed by.\n\tThe thought of a storyline is laughable - the movie's a rant, an illogical ramble doomed by its nonsensicality.  For the sake of brevity and avoiding swimming in paragraphs of indecipherable \"plot\" description, I'll say that \"The Holy Mountain,\" more or less, is a satire of religious practice, esotericism, and cultural exoticism, finding its many layers through various vignettes that involve several individuals' attempts to find fulfillment or reach some sort of vague sort of enlightenment in their already fitful lives.\n\tBut \"The Holy Mountain\" is not as cerebrally minded as the works of societal criticizer Luis Bu√±uel, whose movies seem conventional when compared to Jodorowsky's.  Whereas Bu√±uel attacks his figures of interest through cutting dialogue matched by clever imagery, Jodorowsky relies heavily on his photographic techniques, his set design, and his staging - though Godardian narration sometimes guides us in the direction of assorted conclusions, all moments of monologue and dialogue do little to enhance the effect the imagery already has on us.\n\tAnd there's power in that.  As a purist with a small capacity for films that prefer style over substance, phenomenal is the way Jodorowsky's able to so persuasively provoke with his images.  What they all mean would require deep analyzation I'm to apathetic to undertake as of now, but his frequent marrying of beauty and violence are confidently mounted and extraordinary to experience.  Like Federico Fellini, perhaps the only filmmaker that seems to bear any sort of similarity to him, Jodorowsky is adept at making his flurries of hallucinatory set pieces carry strong scents of meaning, inviting us to dig deeper into their essences instead of letting them get lifted away into the throes of the purgatory that is masturbatory directing.\n\tBut \"The Holy Mountain\" never feels masturbatory because Jodorowsky is so giving in the sharing of his vision.  There's wacky humor to be found within his labyrinth of color and crypticness, and getting lost in the film's symbols and allegories aplenty is an enticing notion, not a materialistic thought.  Sure the movie eventually loses its momentum - no picture of its byzantine aptitude should have the long running time that it does - but before we begin to feel fatigue are we incapable of forgetting that sense of bracing erraticism that fell beforehand.  You'll never see anything like \"The Holy Mountain,\" and I'm sure you'll never want to.",

It is definitely a movie worth watching, however, I don't think somebody walks away from the viewing without any feeling other than \"Huh\" and \"Man, people do some weird shit for religious purposes.\"\n\nAlejandro Jodorowsky's movie, bankrolled by members and management of The Beatles that was later distributed in 2007 on DVD, is a provocative mix of Art House & Fantasy. I don't pretend to be a master of either nomination and I'm even more reluctant to offer a recommendation for all types of filmgoer to indulge in this film. This film is intense, weird and meant to discomfort the lay pastoral public.\n\nTechnically, each frame is mesmorizing. The colors are brillant and all of the actors' blocking flawless. Barring the obvious religious symbolism amongst the characters, the imagery is more like an exercise in the world of Salvidor Dali than a linear parable for one to decipher and understand.\n\nI think the exploratory filmgoer would enjoy a one time viewing of this film away from overintellectualization and interpretation. This film is meant to be experienced and not understood\n\nTo me this film comes from a similar state of mind that I imagine Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring\" was composed and I strongly feel that much like the throngs of those who attended the first couple of Stravinsky's recitals, you will either stay until the end in shock or protest the film on the streets.",

We shall break the illusion. This is magic! Goodbye to the Holy Mountain. Real life awaits us\".\n\nThe story is about a Christlike figure wanders through bizarre, grotesque scenarios filled with religious and sacrilegious imagery. He meets a mystical guide who introduces him to seven wealthy and powerful individuals, each representing a planet in the solar system. These seven, along with the protagonist, the guide and the guide's assistant, divest themselves of their worldly goods and form a group of nine who will seek out the Holy Mountain, in order to displace the gods who live there and become immortal.\n\nThe Holy Mountain is one of those movies that not everyone is going to like, as through out the years the movie has been a mix bag for a lot of people. Many called the movie \"A pretentious arty film, with no plot and nothing to gaps on to\". If you don't like this movie then that's fine, I mean everyone has different taste in movies and not everyone can like the same thing as other people because that will be quite dull. But in my personal opinion, I love The Holy Mountain and I would actually rank it up as one of the best movie I've seen in years.\n\nAlejandro Jodorowsky (The director of the movie) is what a call a \"spiritual director\", and what I mean is that Alejandro is a very spiritual person and I'm not such a spiritual person myself but I do admire his work. Alejandro Jodorowsky work of art is so open and so transparent that it makes his movies truly unique to watch, and that's why I think The Holy Mountain is a great way to start watching Alejandro films so you can get use to he's style of film making. Everything Alejandro Jodorowsky puts into his art as a personal sense of purpose in them and the ideas he's got isn't difficult to make out in each scene of the movie. The Holy Mountain is a work of art and Alejandro Jodorowsky directing is freaking superb.\n\nWhat I love about The Holy Mountain is how every single scene in this film is so true on reality and how detailed the movie is, and all of that is shown by Alejandro artistic look on life. The movie is absolutely absurd and what I mean is without spoiling anything; these a scene where a women is sitting on this super tall toilet and I'm not going to break it down like most people have by saying, \"The toilet is suppose to represent her as an upper class citizen to everyone\", no, what the movie is trying to get across (In my opinion) is how absurd it is and to make you think twice about the things we take for granted, I mean just look at everything that's still current in present day life, back in the sixties, seventies and eighties are still present today and all the things we do are suppose to me you think \"Wow, that's retarded\", and the point of the movie is to look at all the things that have become normality makes you realize it's absurd.\n\nThese a lot that you can interpret in terms of statements that's in the movie like politics, religion and social life, and the movie says so much about every issue and it's so true and timeless. Every single second of the movie is making a statement and the movie has some much to say that it doesn't waste it's time doing so.\n\nThe soundtrack in this movie is one of the best soundtracks I've ever listened to. Alejandro Jordorowsky, Don Cherry, Ron Frangipane and Andrew Arnold were the composers and I thought they did a magnificent job. The music in the movie really dose help on what type of emotion your suppose to be getting from the scene. Once you watch it a few times and you understand everything that's going to happen in the scene and you get the music in your head at the same time really adds to the experience, well it did for me. \n\nNow for the problems: I have none.\n\nOverall The Holy Mountain is a fantastic movie that really connected with me as a viewer. The movie never sloppily pretends to be doing anything different; all of it is completely self-ware of itself. The movie isn't for everyone so if you didn't like this movie then that's totally fine, but I freaking love this movie.",

He gets up to the top of the tower, where he meets the Alchemist (Jodorowsky), who gives the thief a choice of being his apprentice, and the Alchemist shows the Thief seven people who represent the planets in astrological terms, and they are gathered before the Alchemist where they burn their money, and set off as a party to Lotus Island to discover the secret of immortality. If you've seen El Topo, you'll probably know what to expect with this, but it does have some scenes that you'll never see in other films, like human excrement being turned into gold. But it's a shame Jodorowsky hasn't made more films, as he has a way of filmmaking like no other, and this has a touch of what he could have done with Dune.",

            "content": "The Holy Mountain might be the most complicated movie I've ever seen.  I would like to point that I had to watch the movie 3 and a half times to interpret it just to give you my thoughts!  And even now I'm not sure on some details.  And in all honesty there's some of you who are going to hate it because of how surreal it is.  Well I was hating it too, but on repeated viewings it became obvious that the choices being made had purpose.  Something to understand with movies like this is that they don't follow the traditional 3 act structure.  They rely on twisting the narrative to help deliver their story where it would be restricted if it were formulated.  And that's not to say the three act structure is bad; many of my favorites like Ghostbusters or Shame didn't need to have a different narrative.  However, that also doesn't mean all movies that don't follow that narrative are nothing more than random crap.  Movies like Holy Motors can't helped but be described as random bullshit.  \n\nFor me to like a movie that's different it has to be different with a purpose and this is probably the best example I can think of right now.  Essentially The Holy Mountain is a satirical assault on all of society that to this day rings depressingly true.  What I loved about the satire was that it just showed you it and let you figure them out for yourself.  It's characters are involved with the statements with the Alchemist lecturing our hero, referred as the thief, and the other thieves represented by the planets of our solar system.  Which is a good thing since the movie never sloppy becomes preachy like a certain Hungry franchise.  From the top of my head the range of statements being made follow as: glorification of violence in the media, tolerance of violence in entertainment, religion's connection to consumerism, reliance on greed and the cost willing to achieve desires, glorification of war, worshiping things of no artistic value as art, and so on.  Chances are if you find something ridiculous you're supposed to.\n\nIf you wanted to judge it on a level of acting, cinematography, and directing all stood out as superb.  Acting is kind of like a documentary in the sense it documents the actor's actions.  To see them fearlessly tackle scenes that require the surreal, sometimes horrifying gives me even more respect for the level of trust they had with Alejandro Jodorowsky.  You can show up to the movie with zero interest for the satire and still enjoy from how weird it is.  And if you do care following the journey of our hero, the thief, just wanting to be a better person is an extremely relatable theme and makes the satire resonate that stronger.  My only complaints are kind of subjective; it bothers me a little to see animals being harmed all though they were convincing and with purpose.\n\nIt's pretty cool to finally enjoy a work of art that actually knew what it was implying.  I'm more than comfortable giving this a 9/10 and I wouldn't be surprised if I solidified it on repeated viewings.  For a movie could tackle so much satire and still be relatable since 1973 isn't telling how masterful it is then I don't know what is.  Finding The Holy Mountain is a challenge we all face, whether we decide to be a piece shit or golden is up to us.",

            "content": "After seeing Jodorowsky's Dune, I had to get a look into Alejandro Jodorowsky's film style. And with glowing recommendations from a friend to see The Holy Mountain, I figured it would be the right place to start it all.\n\nI can honestly say that while I really did not know what to expect from The Holy Mountain, my highest hopes were that it would be some strange and artistic surrealist film full of unforgettable imagery.\nFor the first look I got into Alejandro Jodorowsky's style of filmmaking, I must say that I was quite an interesting experience. The narrative in the film is very ambiguous if there even is one at all, but the value of the film is hardly predicated on that and I was well aware of that before going in to the film. It is structured like a strange series of vignettes in the manner of a William S. Burroughs novel. It actually feels a lot like something he would have made if he was a film director for Mexican cinema. I once said that I didn't think a film could be built on pure surrealism as a reaction to David Lynch's Eraserhead, but Alejandro Jodorowsky made me change my mind on that. His surrealistic vision for the film is poetic, and even though its attempts at narrative are very convoluted, the versatile and colourful nature of the imagery in the film manage to craft an implied story out of the mysterious titular The Holy Mountain. It is particularly peculiar in the amount of psychosexual imagery that is present in the film. Ranging from sexually active cross-dressers to children with green penises, The Holy Mountain is mercilessly strange in a surreal and sexual manner. It is certainly an experience that is not meant for everybody because it is one of those films which has never heard of the word subtlety. And yet, it is far from exploitive. \nAlejandro Jodorowsky didn't so much craft a film out of Holy Mountain, but rather a nonconventional collage of surreal imagery. His work is clearly artistic because it is a complex expression of the human body and the mysterious world we live in out on a strange religious location tentatively titled The Holy Mountain. I'll admit that there could have been more focus on the narrative though. While there is a promising beginning, the structure of the film begins to cut a bit loose when the main character is introduced to even people who will accompany him on his journey. The film loses sight of its story progression at this point in the film because it breaks away to focus on all of them as individuals. This becomes too much because while the film is full of surreal imagery, there is at least a main character for it to chronicle. When it loses sight of this and increases the amount of characters it tries to put emphatic focus on, it detracts from the loose narrative and essentially becomes a bit much to keep following on with. The film remains good because its magical surrealism is all there, and although the toll of the loosely structured narrative is taken, the general style and passion in the film still manages to transcend it all. As a piece of art, The Holy Mountain works as a strong collection of complex imagery and characters, an amalgamation of both the beauty and the insanity of Alejandro Jodorowsky's mind. The Holy Mountain is a film which is a lot of things. It is slow, yet beautiful. Scary, yet poetic. Confusing, and yet understanding. It is simultaneously a great film and a senseless one, but to put it in the context of being a Alejandro Jodorowsky film, it is a very defining film. \nAlejandro Jodorowsky certainly gets his intended vision for the film perfect, for better and for worse. With a larger budget than his prior production El Topo, Holy Mountain has a lot more potential. And in his own way, Alejandra Jodorowsky is able to capitalise on that. It is such an interesting change from the more conventional films of the time because it comes from around the era that the counterculture movement was in its heyday. He tackles material reserved usually for the sick and twisted and manages to almost make it poetic. To add to this sense, the film is strong from an auditory perspective. As well as having well-edited sound effects, there is the subtle touch of a gentle and yet atmospheric musical score in the film. As the title suggests, there are religious elements in The Holy Mountain, and Alejandro Jodorowsky manages to ensure that the atmosphere is rich with religious spirit and an examination of the uplifting mystery of life. The Holy Mountain begs its viewers to ask a lot of questions about life by filling them with a sense of lively mystery, and even though the rate of it is inconsistent, it is all there. The film is a mystical and puzzling experience, but all in all it is just beautiful. The amount of scenery and production design put into the film is wonderful, and it is all captured with dead on cinematography which gives the film a large and surreal scale. There is so much visual passion put into the film without stepping out of his own mind for a second, and so it is an excellent glimpse into it. There is no way to ever fully understand what level of artistic mystery is in the mind of Alejandro Jodorowsky, but The Holy Mountain shows that he has the passion of a contemporary artist and the twisted pattern of thought only found in people like David Lynch. \n\nSo The Holy Mountain is an indulgent piece by director Alejandro Jodorowsky and is proud of it. It is packed with a lot of complex surrealism and beautiful imagery which largely helps to transcend the loosely structured story, although many may find that and the abundance of psychosexuality and such to be overwhelming.",

            "content": "Admittedly \"The Holy Mountain\" is one of the most difficult film I ever had to interpret. Not because it's story is so complicated it demands your full undivided attention to every detail in a frame, but because it draws its inspiration from Tarot cards (thank you Mr. Edogawa for those long lessons), Christian Iconology, Latin American History, futurism, mysticism, politics, astrology in a combination to strange images that correlate together into a difficult to decipher theme. Never do it characters explicitly tell you the significant of the events, but much like the characters it's a journey of enlightenment. It's also one that'll leave you scratching your head until you realize you hit a nerve in your skull.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Mountain gives an omniscient view of what social engineering caused by greed has done to the modern world, but shows us how to live and not give in to a material world. That's one way to put it or more honestly a series of strange visuals, odd metaphors, and a main character who isn't even involved in the ending. Breaking all logic of a traditional narrative being a witness of the journey is not at any point off putting. It speaks figuratively rather than expressing itself through a literal sense. If taken at face value the film will leave you wondering what in the world you just saw. Much in comparison to the thief we follow, the film asks its audience to either go on the journey and be open to whatever is let out of the floodgates of the storyteller consciousness, or if to be closed off then to might as well leave. Visually exploring what is the significant of immorality, religion, and beliefs pondering if reaching enlightenment is more important than the journey to achieve it. Over the top humor pokes fun of the lack of awareness of the form of escapism in surreal ways that ranges from manufacturing art with a fully functioning conveyor belt for butt-imprint paintings to conditioning children to hate specific future enemies. Scenes all of which are a natural representation of escapism either be through photographs, paintings, videos, or anything that mentally makes the subject escape reality. Before reaching the end the figurative meaning behind it images will culminate into a narrative that touches on various themes. Each of which make sense (in this film logic that is) in the surreal manner they are presented in. Once it reaches the abstract ending is where there's a glaring misstep. The ending itself spoon feeds everything the viewer witness in a final dialogue that reaffirms what you just saw was nothing more than it just appeared to be. Misguiding half of the meaning it actually was trying to get across. Then again, from a literal standpoint it goes along with the rest of the film. \r\n\r\nAlejandro Jodorowsky is the film writer/director/producer/editor/music composer/costume designer/set designer/painter/sculptor/star and his input is on screen all the time. Creating a world that in semblance is no further than our very own, it's just presented in a different form. At times the film looks absolutely gorgeous and it's design are eye popping with surreal designs and bright colors. There is a scene where the thief enters a rainbow room with a single holy man and a camel. A struggle breaks out but the primitive learns that he is not worthy to overcome the much wiser man. Suggesting the brighter the color in the rainbow passage the greater the growth. It's just one of the symbolic nature elements within. This intricate collective designed is sure to challenge the thoughts and translation of the viewer. As well as the set decorations, props, and the costumes and it pays off as the film is gorgeous to look at even if at times it's a little hard to decipher without an innate knowledge of world religions and the occult. The whole film is a literal two hour intellectual LSD trip. In the scene where Axon of Neptune and his healthy young army massacre a town, the montage we see of blood, dust and guts isn't entirely wounds overflowing with deep red or gory close-ups of torn flesh. Instead there are sticky greens and blues bubbling from bodies, obvious red ribbons from the gut and, in a rather touching moment from within the violence, little birds fluttering from the chest of a dead body. This barely scratches the surface of the surreal images you're going to see in the whole film. \r\n\r\nThe Holy Mountain is surreal, deep, and one of the hardest films to make sense off if there's any to be found if we speaking in a literal sense. If taken at face value the series of events will have little correlation, but never is it boring because of it surreal images. It's a difficult film to recommend anyone to see because while it provides no background on everything it tackles. The abstract interpretation on the series of odd images is more than satisfactory for viewers seeking to challenge their minds. That is until it partially misguide viewers toward the end. No matter how the film is interpreted \"The Holy Mountain\" is never boring for what it bring to the forefront to the viewers that will confuse as well captivate the imagination.",

Over-the-top, strange, and far too graphic for young me.  However, upon revisiting, I found myself smitten.  It may not rank up with Jodorowsky's best films (that title belongs to Santa Sangre), but it's highly surreal and very beautiful.  Deeper themes lie within, such as the religious allegories.  The film is based on Ascent of Mount Carmel by Saint John of the Cross and Mount Analogue by Ren√© Daumal, who was a student of George Gurdjieff. In this film, much of Jodorowsky's visually psychedelic story follows the metaphysical thrust of Mount Analogue. This is revealed in such events as the climb to the alchemist, the assembly of individuals with specific skills, the discovery of the mountain that unites Heaven and Earth \"that cannot not exist\", and symbolic challenges along the mountain ascent. Daumal died before finishing his allegorical novel, and Jodorowsky's improvised ending provides a way of completing the work (both symbolically and otherwise).  However, even if you ignore the thematic elements, you'll find a pleasing, surreal film.  Most folk won't enjoy it, due to it's lurid content, and that's what's holding this film back, but it's a very deep, surreal trip.",

I probably missed a vast majority of the allusions but the spiritual message stands strong. Incorporating such philosophies as  \"Money is the Root of All Evil\", Jodorowsky takes a stand against THE church, but shows importance of spirituality. Similar to Bunuel's Mexican film Simon of the Desert, and stylistically similar to the work of Makavejev, The Holy Mountain  criticizes greed with in the church, in the exploitation of the crucifix.  The planet segment (representing bureaucracy) was the most fascinating and lively part of the film.

Jodorowsky poses here as spiritually inspired, as a figure to lead you to enlightenment, who knows that while you are shit, you can turn yourself into gold. But he is a witch doctor, a charlatan whose film is all smoke and mirrors. He bombards us with images from tarot, astrology, judeo-christian principles, buddhism, hinduism, and human depravity, but it's nowhere near as profound or spiritual as he thinks it is. He forces us through two long, long hours of sophomoric satires, purple parodies, obnoxious axioms, and unsimulated cattle fucking, all the while promising us the light at the end of the tunnel. But his idea of enlightenment is an anti-climatic, unfunny meta-joke - one that turns us back, once again, to himself and his self-anointed holiness. Yes, it is a beautiful thing to look at, and admiring it on a skin-deep level is fine. Because that's how deep it really goes - it's all a sham, and we should try our best to beware of false prophets.",

There is no option but to respond to The Holy Mountain, because it is a slap in the face and a kick to the groin. It's totally grotesque, surreal, psychedelic and loud as hell. The imagery is so grotesque it borders on oppressive (which is certainly the intent). The set-design/mise-en-scene is immaculate, the inverted religious and political symbolism is lurid and insane and mostly enthralling (though there are points it wears on you), and there's a point where all of the film's forms of subversion and blasphemy create an almost sacred ambiance. That or a weird-ass cult. I can't be sure. It's as if Jodorowsky (the Director, Star, Writer, Producer, Editor etc. WTF) is constructing his own cult of rebellion.There is nothing like \"THM\" that exists in Art. If anything, Jodorowsky has made something wholly singular, which gives it an unmistakable energy that can only come from the purity of expression. Expression...and a truckload of LSD and mushrooms. PS. There is a 10-minute scene where Horned Frogs are costumed and effectively re-enact the conquest of Mexico on a model of right before they are blown to hell ( the frogs are actually blown apart by real explosives, sorry PETA); while a Thief dressed to resemble Jesus Christ watches. This 'Christ Figure' later eats the face of mannequin made in his image, which turns out to be birthday cake. He then sends the faceless Mannequin up to heaven with a host of red and blue balloons.

That being said, I think that The Holy Mountain is probably the best that I've seen so far. I remember not liking El Topo all that much (although I saw it a very long time ago). This film is surrealistic and really hits you hard with imagery and ideas. I found myself captivated for the entire running time. There's never a moment when the film really ends either. It just kind of stops. I only recommend the film to the very open-minded and not people who simply want a story.

There's a brief scene where a group of frogs and lizards are dressed as Spanish conquistadors, then suddenly the frogs explode off-screen for no real reason. In another scene, a group of innocent people are shot, but instead of blood coming out of their wounds, birds fly out of the gaping holes in their chests.
