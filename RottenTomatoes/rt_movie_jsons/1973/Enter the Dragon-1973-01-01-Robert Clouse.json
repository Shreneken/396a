            "content": "An All Time Classic. The music is phenomenal and gives this such a unique funk/chinese identity that's really catchy. The sets are lavish and creative along with a great cast. The part that sends this over the top is easily Bruce Lee. His presence, intimidation, speed, and fighting is incredible to watch. The ending is super creative as well and a great lesson about fighting. The only knock is the audio ADR is REALLY BAD in the beginning with the master talking to Lee, but after that it gets much better. You don't need to even like martial arts movies to like this one, it's that good. Everyone should give this a try once.",

            "content": "To start my review, I should point out I'm not too familiar with Bruce Lee's filmography. Though a long-term fan, I've only seen Big Boss and haven't known much about what his movies have to offer. That being said, this was one of my favorite action films I've seen in a long while and for reasons I was surprised to enjoy as well.\n     First off, the film had costume design and film settings to create an excellent visual standard. I found myself laughing over and over again at different exploits of the comedic aspects of the visuals, like the scene where the afro-ninja calls the Chinese boss a scene out of a comic book before poising for combat, an insane pleasantry I did not expect from a 70's action film. Furthermore, the themes of supporting people of color, character-role equality, martial arts in American films, and different females, emulating a sort of gender equality was shockingly progressive for a film that came out in 1973. The amount of scenes I laughed at was the most surprising part of this film based on what I was used to in the movie 'Big Boss.'\n      To move on to the demonstrations of martial arts and acting, I thought it had a range of showing off different skills and acting abilities to further keep the progressive feel to it. It show-cased a lot of Bruce Lee's ability as a fighter and acting prowess (especially in the iconic scene where he fights the man with the scar) but my one problem was that it highlighted martial arts as a comedic effect rather than trying to keep it entirely realistic. The amount of sneaking scenes, the scene where the women on heroin could flip a full grown man with one arm, and some of the character writing were slightly comical and exaggerated rather than a realistic overview. On the other hand, seeing an overview of Bruce Lee's transition from a Chinese martial arts upbringing to a more hands on solution was amazing to watch as a tribute to the way he grew up and became a renowned actor as well. Scenes with the escorts, the female escort that helped him, and the transitioning through Wing-Chun weapons; in the scene he went from staff to dual-batons to Nunchakus was awesome to see portrayed on a big-screen setting. \n   Overall, this will always be a cult classic and an all-time favorite, but the one thing that keeps me from giving it a 5-star rating is the indulgence on American culture being supreme over the martial arts. Even the scene at the end where the helicopters come over the horizon felt indulgent for a conflict that wasn't really being understood. Even though I'll always have a fondness for this classic movie, I can't forget that the real nature of Bruce Lee's fighting and acting was slightly buried under America's capitalist intentions.",

            "content": "I'm not certain if this was the first \"secret invite-only martial arts tournament movie,\" but it's certainly the most iconic. Enter the Dragon is filled with many beautiful scenes of Hong Kong (it was filmed on-site) \u2014 especially overhead shots and shots out on the water \u2014 but that's not what you came for, is it? If you put on Enter the Dragon to watch Bruce Lee devastate countless, nameless henchmen, then you've chosen wisely. Like Bloodsport, the actual martial arts scenes are incredible. Unlike Bloodsport, the non-martial arts scenes aren't nearly as corny and the overall plot is better, if not a little campy at times. Cinephiles loves tropes (and also hate them) and sometimes it's fun to see where they come from. Again, not positive if this film was the first \"evil, reclusive, ultra-rich villain who pets a white cat and is surrounded by hot babes on a secluded island with lots of artifacts and booby traps and nameless henchmen\" movie, but it's the earliest one I can think of at the moment. Unfortunately, the biggest letdown of the film is that there really isn't much of a tournament at all. We're introduced to some cool fighters \u2014 Roper (John Saxon), Williams (Jim Kelly), Bolo (Bolo Yeung) \u2014 who do engage in one v. one melees, but lacked the panache of Bloodsport and Mortal Kombat when it came to the actual tournament. *Side Note* I love Bolo Yeung; complete badass and all-time fight-face guy. Because of this, we don't get the classic montage of our fighters rolling through the tournament, one ass-kicking at a time. We even had a 70s-forward score that would've paired nicely with Lee round-housing opponents in the face\u2026 oh well. I think everything there is to say about Bruce Lee has been said, so I'll just add this, \"Be water, my friend.\" And he was. The greatest of all time. *(100/100 for the Angora cat, of course.)",

            "content": "ENTER THE DRAGON (1973)\nAnother supposed crime against cinema has been rectified, I finally sat down to watch Bruce Lee's magnum opus. And it was madness. My knowledge of the Kung-Fu genre is disgracefully small; that Enter The Dragon reminded me so much of The Man With The Golden Gun (1974) speaks volumes to that. But that's a feeling not entirely without merit; Moore's Bond vehicle was released a mere year after Enter The Dragon and is peppered with Lee influences. It's true that Enter The Dragon is no masterpiece-the first third or so is baffling in film making terms and kind of all over the place, but the rest of it is so entertaining, it more than makes up for any stumbling about in the first half hour or so. Lee is sent by British intelligence to an Island belonging to Han, a rich bastard who is involved in drug trafficking and the sex trade. He is to partake in a martial arts tournament that is held annually on the Island. I didn't have a huge amount of time to dwell on the specifics before the action attempts to wipe your memory of the setup with admittedly great success. It plays like a spy thriller, the Bond comparisons are unavoidable but certainly not unwelcome, and the epic fight at the end of the film is fantastically choreographed. It was also impossible to watch the fight between Lee and Han at the films conclusion, in a hall of mirrors, without thinking of Scaramangas' house of fun at the conclusion of The Man With The Golden Gun. But all of that works in Enter The Dragon's favour; it's a compliment that the Bond franchise followed up a year later with so many borrowed ideas, presumably to appeal to the Asian audience.",

Bro, the afro brother took out the two cops and then straight up jacked the cop car lmao! I can admire and respect the camera work. All the zoom outs and zoom ins he does and the way the camera moves to convey a certain feeling about the scene. There's actually some pretty funny moments throughout.

Lee is persuaded to attend a high-profile martial arts competition on Han's private island to gather evidence that will prove Han's involvement in drug trafficking and prostitution. Shortly before his departure, Lee also learns that the man responsible for his sister's death, O'Hara, is working as Han's bodyguard on the island. Also fighting in the competition are Roper (John Saxon), an indebted gambling addict, and fellow Vietnam war veteran Williams (Jim Kelly). At the end of the first day, Han gives strict orders to the competitors not to leave their rooms. Lee makes contact with undercover operative Mei Ling and sneaks into Han's compound, looking for evidence. He is discovered by several guards but manages to escape. The next morning, Han orders his giant guard Bolo to kill the guards in public for failing their duties. After the execution, Lee faces O'Hara in the competition and ends up killing him. With the day's competition over, Han confronts Williams, who had also left his room the previous night to exercise. Han believes Williams to be the intruder and beats him to death when he refuses to cooperate. Han then reveals his drug operation to Roper, hoping that he will join his organisation. He also implicitly threatens to imprison Roper, along with all the other martial artists who joined Han's tournaments in the past, if Roper refuses. Despite being initially intrigued, Roper refuses after learning of Williams's fate...\n\nUpon release, the film initially received mixed reviews from several critics, including a favorable review from Variety magazine. The film eventually went on to be well-received by most critics, and it is widely regarded as one of the best films of 1973. Critics have referred to Enter the Dragon as \"a low-rent James Bond thriller\", a \"remake of Dr. No\" with elements of Fu Manchu. J.C. Ma\u00e7ek III of PopMatters wrote, \"Of course the real showcase here is the obvious star here, Bruce Lee, whose performance as an actor and a fighter are the most enhanced by the perfect sound and video transfer. While Kelly was a famous martial artist and a surprisingly good actor and Saxon was a famous actor and a surprisingly good martial artist, Lee proves to be a master of both fields.\" Many acclaimed newspapers and magazines reviewed the film. Variety described it as \"rich in the atmosphere\", the music score as \"a strong asset\" and the photography as \"interesting\". Additionally, The New York Times gave the film a rave review. The review stated \"The picture is expertly made and well-meshed; it moves like lightning and brims with color. It is also the most savagely murderous and numbing hand-hacker (not a gun in it) you will ever see anywhere.\" Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Badass to the max, Enter the Dragon is the ultimate kung-fu movie and fitting (if untimely) Bruce Lee swan song.\". In 2004, the film was deemed \"culturally significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nWith a budget, at least in this Bruce Lee case, there\u00b4s some sort of production value. We even get a musical score by the master himself Lalo Shifrin. The Martial Arts genre is not really my genre, and \"Enter The Dragon\" does not change that to be honest. But, this film is much \"better\" than \"The Big Boss\" and \"Game of Death\" in my book. \"Enter The Dragon\" would be Lee's final completed film appearance before his death on 20 July 1973 at age 32. An American and Hong Kong co-production, it premiered in Los Angeles on 19 August 1973, one month after Lee's death. The film went on to gross an estimated US$350 million worldwide (equivalent to more than $1 billion adjusted for inflation), against a budget of $850,000. Having earned over 400 times its budget, it is one of the most profitable films of all time. \"Enter the Dragon\" is also considered one of the most influential action films of all time, with its success contributing to mainstream worldwide interest in martial arts as well as inspiring numerous fictional works including action films, television shows, fighting games, comic books, manga and anime.",

The cast is excellent across the board, with Jim Kelly making a nice debut as Williams while the John Saxon brings gravitas as the conman, Roper (along with some nice moves, as he was actually a black belt himself).  Of course, it is Bruce Lee who dominates every moment he is on screen, oozing the power and charisma that creates a superstar.  The speed and power in delivers in the fight scenes is undeniable (his nunchuck routine remains iconic), while he also shows range as a man on a mission while also seeking revenge.  Behind the camera, director Robert Clouse crafts what is essentially a James Bond movie, but an effective one, with a nice mix of characters and a charming villain (a superb Kien Shih), along with some brilliant action set pieces (the final fight in the mirror room remains standout).  All in all, one of the best of films by both Bruce Lee and the martial arts genre.",

            "content": "A riveting Hollywood Bruce Lee movie!\n\nRobert Clouse's martial arts action picture Enter the Dragon (1973) is a bittersweet swan song for Bruce Lee to make as his final completed film before his tragic death. Enter the Dragon is entertaining demonstrating Bruce Lee's acting chops and kung fu kicks and punches with deadly speed. Lee makes fighting look effortless here. He was clearly in peak physical condition, strong and fast as he ever was, so it's especially sad that he died so young. \n\nBruce Lee is still a legendary actor, martial artist, philosopher, and pop culture icon, rightfully so. He was charming, charismatic, funny, skilled, smart, and elegant in his graceful approach to life and combat. He wanted to spread Chinese kung fu's prowess to the world. At least he got to do that with classics of cinema like Enter the Dragon. Bruce Lee's character Lee from Enter the Dragon will live on forever as a master of discipline, thinker of martial arts philosophies, and fearsome fast fighter like no other. Rest in paradise, Bruce Lee.\n\nAngela Mao is killer as Bruce Lee's martial arts adept sister Su Lin in Enter the Dragon. Her spinning kicks look flawless and fast in the captivating chase sequence towards the beginning of Enter the Dragon. Mao is both lovely and cool as the powerful martial artist Su Lin. \n\nJohn Saxon is hilarious and suave as the charming debonair Roper. His fight scenes are the next best thing after Bruce Lee's, honestly. Sek Kin is cool, cruel, and memorable as Enter the Dragon's ruthless villain Han. His metallic hand and knife hand are excellent violence gimmicks to keep Bruce Lee on his toes. Ahna Capri is gorgeous as the voluptuous Tania on Han's island. Her natural chemistry with Saxon is nice to see too. Jim Kelly is cool as the blacksploitation type character Williams. His combat sequences are neat and his dialogue is so silly that you cannot help but laugh along with him. \n\nRobert Wall is despicable as Oharra in another great performance from him in a Bruce Lee film. Betty Chung is so beautiful and intriguing as Mei Ling the undercover spy in Enter the Dragon. I wish she was in the film even more. Bolo Yeung is terrifying as Han's vicious henchman Bolo.\n\nRobert Clouse's direction is less artful than Lo Wei or Bruce Lee's direction for Lee's previous kung fu classics, but Clouse finds his stride with massive Hollywood production elements and fun scenes. He takes you from Hong Kong to a remote island with all the lively entertainment you could want in a movie. His mirror sequence is brilliant like Han's first fight in his lair. There's a lot of creativity and parody of James Bond elements too that are fun.\n\nMichael Allin's script is a fun mixture of martial arts, crime drama, and espionage thriller with twists all around and a seedy tone. Yao Chung Chang's editing is stellar with Enter the Dragon's run-time remaining a brisk 102 minutes long.\n\nGil Hubbs' cinematography shoots the fights with a stylish flair that is very 1970's exaggerated for fun. His wide shots of Hong Kong and the island are gorgeous and a neat timepiece for the era. All the shots for Han's fights are psychedelic and trippy with a ton of filmmaking tricks that are daring for a Hollywood movie. Shen Chien's art direction is pretty with a classic Chinese aesthetic for everything alongside Chu Sheng-Hsi's lavish groovy costumes. Lalo Schifrin's score is exciting with a suspense to it that helps give Enter the Dragon some dramatic weight.\n\nI should mention there's a funny cameo from a young Jackie Chan as a stunt man that Bruce Lee kills in Han's base of operations in the middle of the movie. I believe that Bruce Lee also got his legendary mentor Ip Man himself to cameo as the elderly man rowing Bruce Lee's boat to Han's ship in the start of Enter the Dragon.\n\nIn the end, Enter the Dragon is a legendary film for being Bruce Lee's final finished project and a completing delightful experience to watch countless times over. Thank you for the movies, Bruce.",

The first half is a solid, ensemble detective/spy film, with well-drawn characters, the second half is a rip-roaring martial arts extravaganza; the fight scenes under ground using the sticks and the nunchucks and around the elevator before he's captured is electric even today, very modern and influential, and the end fights with the huge cast of extras is a really exciting third act, especially in today's age of CGI.\nIt's serious and silly, it's dated and timeless, it's a hell of a lot of fun and it's got a little bit of heart and a little bit of spirituality.",

It starts out alright because it takes a few minutes to establish all our main protagonists so we can see why they are participating in the tournament. But once the characters start heading to the tournament and all throughout the tournament proceedings it is a jumbled mess of nonsense. It was so hard to track what anyone was doing or hoping to attain at any given moment. The tournament itself lacked any logical structure. In fact for a good portion of the movie I had a hard time figuring out which person was supposed to be the primary villain of the story. Also there were a few actors in the film that never convinced me that they had much martial arts talent, particularly John Saxon, which is a big problem in this type of movie. I\u2019m not saying he is completely worthless in the fight scenes, but it was hard to buy him defeating some of the more skilled stuntmen. The reason I talk about all that frustration I experienced with the plot of the film and some of the actors, is because I\u2019m trying to mentally reconcile the fact that the movie was full of flaws and yet I had a blast watching it. It\u2019s so odd to have your brain saying something is not good, but at the same time in the back of your head a voice keeps telling you \u201cThis is awesome!\u201d It touched on some deeper more visceral part of my mind that reacts on instinct instead of logic The fight choreography is remarkable, and loaded with exaggerated sound effects that make it feel more intense. Robert Clouse knows how to shoot the fights to keep them exciting, and also knows the perfect moment to utilize slow motion to increase the impact of any given kick or punch. Even when I didn\u2019t fully understand the motivations of the two characters in a fight it didn\u2019t matter to me because I was excited about the skill involved and how it would end. Part of the reason I found Enter the Dragon so engaging is the remarkable talent of Bruce Lee. I knew he was amazing at martial arts, and the fights that he staged in this film prove his skill. What I didn\u2019t know before watching this movie is how charming he was as an actor. He has a suave style that makes you instantly like him the moment he walks on screen. He has a magnetic personality, and he also can portray sorrow and other complex emotions. It increased my emotional investment in the film simply because I felt he was impacted by all that happened to his character. And since he was the one in peril in the climax, I was more worried than I might have been in any other nonsensical movie like this one. Needless to say, I struggled with some important aspects of Enter the Dragon, and under any other circumstances I could see myself saying it was terrible and that I hate it. However, I had a ton of fun watching the movie, and I\u2019d love to see more from Bruce Lee.",

Lee's choreography and super hard work/passion shines especially when placed in well-shot locations that take advantage of different fighting scenarios.\nThe entire film crew deliver a piece of work that is rich with culture, colours, music, period pieces from the 70s, and of course, action where the post production sound effects make you feel every bone crushing hit the actors deliver to each other.\nThe film is light on plot, but honestly, the plot is not the focus, but rather, an excusable vehicle to showcase Lee's unprecedented work where the villains get what they deserve and the heroes do their best to reach their dreams. \nThe amount of passion put into the film just leaps off the screen and everybody involved deserves an applause. There is a reason why it sparked the popularity of Martial Arts and helped inspire many others from filmmakers to bodybuilders. I bow my head down to the late great master...but I'll make sure to keep my eyes on the prize!",

Considering its impact in pop culture, is this the classic many people claim it is? \n\nLee is a highly skilled martial artist that is tasked by the British intelligence to investigate a crime lord called Han, by attending martial arts tournament. \n\nWhen you watch any genre movie you have different expectations: With horror we expect good scares, comedy with good jokes, spy movies with cool/memorable gadgets and tremendous action sequences, etc. So when it comes to martial arts movies we expect some well-choreographed action sequences and to be highly entertaining and \"Enter the Dragon\" succeeds at this. Being a B movie, this Bruce Lee film has a cheesy plot, wooden acting, hilariously dated special effects, forgettable characters and eye roll inducing dialog. However despite its numerous flaws this film stands out and deserves its reputation. \"Enter the Dragon\" has outstanding fighting scenes (which is not surprising considering that most people in here are martial artists but still, the results are tremendous), spectacular stunts, the score is fantastic, the pacing is spot on, and overall it is quite entertaining. However the greatest thing about this film isn't the martial arts themselves but the incredible production design as it is quite simple but surprisingly effective and unforgettable. From the simple tournament setting to the villain\u00b4s iconic lair, this production design has been imitated to death (\"Man with the Golden Gun\" and \"Mortal Kombat\" being the first ones that come to mind) but never duplicated. \n\n\"Enter the Dragon\" is a well-made film that not only fulfills its duty of giving the audience fantastic action sequences but it also shines due to its production design. A highly entertaining film worth seeing.",

I sure didn't. Just pointing out the obvious things that anyone would find if those chose to watch this with a critical thinking mind, which you would easily spot the problems straight away. But the movie dose deliver on one thing and that's the punch, with it's flawless Martial art fight scenes. This is a very enjoyable movie with Bruce Lee showing off his awesomeness in his last ever film.\n\nWithout a doubt, the best part of this movie is the fight scenes and I know it's quite obvious to say that, but the fights are the highlight of the film. I felt every hit, punch, kick and smack in all the fight scenes and it's all by the power of Bruce Lee himself. It's glorious to watch and it's by far the best on screen fight scene from any movie I've seen, I mean the amount of detail that Lee puts in his fights are just extraordinary. There's no quick cuts or shaky cam used in those scenes, as it was all naturally filmed. I would go that far and say it's true art *like the title* \"Martial arts.\"\n\nThis movie doesn't have the most intriguing story, as it's more of a prop itself to hang up in the background so we can get to the real juice stuff. So people can't say it doesn't have a story because it dose, but it's too silly and hasn't got anything remotely interesting that can grab my interest on what's going on. It's also a slow burn at the start, as it takes awhile to get where it needs to go, but it's worth the wait.\n\nThe acting was pretty bad, as I notice countless times that some of the actors have no emotional on their face when there's scenes that's suppose to be intense or somewhat funny. The editing is really off as well and it's mostly to do with it's weird cuts that comes out of nowhere that feels out of place.\n\nOverall Enter the Dragon is a very enjoyable movie with plenty of fun to be have. But what really sucks is that this is the final film we will ever see of the unique, extreme, but talented, Bruce Lee. The legacy will live on.\n\nBonus fact: Jackie Chan makes a small cameo in the movie. The title of the video is wrong, but hey. www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8CtOqJy6xM",

This is not a chawade. We need total concentwation.\" or \"These are lost drunken men who don't know where they are, but do care! And these are men who know where they are and care, but don't drink.\"). That aside and some goofy mugging by Bruce Lee, this film is an absolute martial arts classic. The story is super basic (the evil Han is hosting a martial arts tournament and Bruce is sent in by a spy agency to stop Han's evil doings) but the story perfectly facilitates lots of kung-fu action. An honest assessment of this film is that it's pretty dated and actually pretty corny when viewed through modern sensibilities, but despite that, Bruce Lee is amazing! Bruce with the nunchuks. Bruce taking out a tunnel full of henchmen. And Bruce striding through the crowd to get to Han at the end. Bruce is just awesome and that's what carries the film. John Saxon always seemed like odd casting as one of the three main leads and is passable, even if his martial arts was not. Jim Kelly however is quite good in role, which led to his underrated film \"Black Belt Jones.\" Look for a young Sammo Hung as the Shaolin fighter Bruce has a demonstration match with in the opening. Jackie Chan is apparently one of the prison thugs who fights Bruce, although I couldn't spot him. Also, Keye Luke did uncredited dubbing for Dr. Han. The film also earns at least 1/2 a star for the terrific and iconic Lalo Schifrin music. Bruce's previous Hong Kong films are better demonstrations of his martial arts skills, but this film features an overall better production value and slickness his previous films lacked.",

His incredible physique and talent as a leading actor. I would say, this film is so funky, with that 70's music style and that mixed up very well with the martial arts theme and the characterization. You can see in each other's martial arts abilities. This is 70's and some martial arts nor action fight scenes of today, are still imitating some of the well choreographed moves of Enter the Dragon. I used to love some of the characters such as Williams and that Afro guy Roper and their roles fits them so well. If you used to be a gamer and played Tekken. Now we're talking. In short, this Bruce Lee film made him not just a popular actor, but an Icon. And this film is Iconic. 5 stars all the way!",

With that out of the way, Enter The Dragon is one huge martial arts classic that even has been regarded as one of the best films of 1973 and Culturally or Historically Significant by the National Film Registry. Being a fan of Martial Arts films, I was anxious to watch this, and the result was great. Bruce Lee is still the master even after Jackie Chan or Jet Lee, or even Tony Jaa. This film can also be a huge excuse to watch Lee doing what he does better: scream! Just kidding, kicking everyone's asses with that \"I'm Invincible\" face he always carries.\r\n\r\nBruce also proved to be a legit actor, as his performance was actually decent and his English also good. It's curious how this movie has little to none character development, and yet the characters are memorable; maybe it's because we see what they can do and they do it in a very cool way. Transformers does the same but the result isn't nearly as good. I guess they have some charm we can't help but feel, as they martial arts skills easily drags us in. Undeniably a classic.\r\n\r\nEnter the Dragon still works today, but maybe not the same way. There's Ong Bak and many other films that had shown much more skilled or believable fight movements and martial arts, but something they will never reach, it's the charm that Bruce Lee had in every film, and this one is no exception at all. I feel like doing some punches and scream like I having my balls removed. HHHYYAAAAAAHHH!",

Add American star John Saxon and introduce a new African American star in badass Jim Kelly. The fighting in this is second to none, the story is meh and the acting is great by the three leads, especially Bruce. This is the movie that made him a superstar but unfortunately he did not live to see it's success, passing away 3 months prior at the extremely young age of 32. P.S. If you look closely, you can spot Jackie Chan. In the scene where Bruce is fighting everyone off with a Bo staff, Jackie comes up behind Bruce and gets him an rear choke hold, of course Bruce turns the tables on Jackie and snaps his 17-year-old neck. \n\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4c/Jackie_Chan_Fist.JPG",

But considering that it transfers the story aspect of Kung Fu into a sensible and original thriller plot, it functions well.\nEnter the Dragon has a really original concept, taking themes of a Kung Fu tournament and moving it into a James Bond style thriller with absence of the gadgets but maintaining all the thrills and action. Except that the action is all well choreographed full-on Kung Fu fights which makes it a brutal contact experience with plenty of punches and kicks, and that's just cool. Really, the ambitious scope of the story makes it more than it needed to be and could have been, and Robert Clouse's direction ensures that it's stylishly shot and full of appealing imagery, as well as a good musical score. \nEnter the Dragon is a well written film, and although it's a bit all over the place at times, it is constantly a strong one. With a powerful lead from Bruce Lee and the presence of the first Black martial arts film star Jim Kelly, it has a diverse cast. Even John Saxon looks like Sean Connery, the best James Bond.\nAnd the appearances of a young Bolo Yeung and Jackie Chan make it a nostalgic piece too, with Bolo Yeung's aggressive darkness making him a strong villain.\nSo really, Enter the Dragon is packed to the brim with nostalgia and Chinese culture, as well as strong acting, a good story and some kickass action which help Enter the Dragon to transcend it's scattered pacing. It's full of great imagery and is a memorable send off for the late Bruce Lee who died way before his time and missed the premiere of Enter the Dragon unfortunately.",

His character in Enter the Dragon has the requisite unflappability of an action hero and Shaolin monk, but the persona is by no means wooden.  His eyes and face can reveal a range of emotion, and are especially animated in the slow-motion shots that help make this movie so visually appealing.  His voice, too, un-dubbed throughout for practically the only time in his career, is composed but forceful.  When he says to the bad guy, \"You have offended my family, and you have offended the Shaolin temple,\" the line carries the clear unspoken addendum \"and now you must die\" not only because it's the obvious thing to say at the climax of a martial arts movie but because of the way Lee delivers it.  Not just any fighter can act, nor vice versa, but Bruce Lee did both.  His skills probably never had a better-looking showcase than Enter the Dragon, with its loving shots of junks and people in a Hong Kong bay and its creative final showdown in a hall of mirrors.  On many lists it's been coronated the \"official\" best martial arts movie ever, and it's easy to see why and to believe it.",

It is a joint American-Chinese production that was intended to be Bruce Lee's introduction to Western audiences, but due to his tragic death just weeks before the film's release.\nThe plot really resembles a James Bond film in my opinion. Director Robert Clouse does an awesome job with camera work, great shots during the fighting scenes, and keep the film at a very fast pace.\nLee makes an amazing performance as a hero, spiritual and complex character, so is John Saxon who is extremely likable and kicked Bolo Yeung's ass. Kien Shih is fantastic as the main villain, extremely menace and pretty creepy looking.\nThere are also several cameos made by future Hong Kong martial arts stars that would eventually reach stardom, most notably Jackie Chan (as a henchman during the \"Cavern Fight\" sequence who has his neck broken by Lee) and Sammo Hung (as Lee's sparring partner in the opening fight sequence).\n\nHighly recommendation!",
