Holly is a very submissive girl that slowly learns to put things in question, and Kit is a happy trigger who barely puts any value in other human beings' life. Their lifestyle, or at least the way they wish to live free, is of course incompatible with our society, it is them against the world. These characters are already entertaining and curious by the way they are written, but they are also perfectly played by Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek. Both actors found their way to play uncommon personalities while never making them unrealistic.\n\nThe deep America surroundings are beautiful to look at, as the direction puts a lot of emphasis on very large plain, on how empty the landscape can be. \n\nThe pace can be weird for some, as the first act goes very quickly and then things slow down, but nothing too bad.",

The Pacing is perfect as it is a brisk non bloated very straight plot but filled with substance. The editing and soundtrack is very well done as well. The film explores how a sociopath can be made, the mindset of of a sociopath, and how one can be manipulated to fall in love with a twisted person. Truly a All Time Classic.",

Beginning with Badlands as a debut, critics have described Badlands as more poetry than film, moving with an intense simplicity, brutality, and beauty from scene to scene. It wields the same base narrative as the 1967 rendition of Bonnie and Clyde, which was itself famed for creating an entirely distinctive genre of film, but adds in a degree of artistic vision that the other seems sorely lacking; where Arthur Penn created a film combining objectively 'bad' people and an empathetic perspective, Malick cut out a slice of America in all its beauty and ugliness and put it up on screen for 93 minutes. The house burning, the wealthy home intrusion, and the final capture that ties everything together each feel potent, especially behind a great performance from Sheen and contrasted well by the generally distant Spacek. The American Midwest is displayed in incredible detail and intensity, beaten only by the 'Golden Hour' scenes of Malick's own Days of Heaven some five years later. (5/5)",

He has a tendency to focus solely on making art rather than telling stories, and I find that tedious and annoying. So when I sat down to watch Badlands I was more than a little leery. There are still some of Malick’s artsy-fartsy moments in this film, as he feels the need to include shots of beetles crawling on weeds, or branches blowing in the breeze. It also seems he has a great passion for breathy women doing voiceover in his films. However, at least in this scenario, Sissy Spacek is talking about plot. Badlands has a story and it tells that story effectively rather than getting bogged down in too much esoteric nonsense. Don’t get me wrong, there wasn’t a ton of plot to Badlands, but any plot from Malick is appreciated. This is a rather familiar Bonnie & Clyde style of story, but in this scenario it's not about robbing banks to make lots of money. Instead it seems like Martin Sheen’s character just considers murder to be a mundane aspect of life. He brings no emotion to it and acts as though this is a perfectly normal thing to do. It was puzzling to me, and certainly made him an interesting character to watch. Sissy Spacek was a good casting choice for the young love interest of this killer, because she can pull off that wide-eyed innocence, and offers some great deer-in-the-headlights stares. But there simply wasn’t much drama in Badlands, since it seemed they were just stalling for time before reaching the inevitable conclusion. Also, the main characters were utterly emotionless when committing crimes, so the film lacked any passion or excitement. Badlands is watchable, but it was a somewhat hollow experience and doesn’t do much to elevate my opinion of Terrence Malick.",

Kit (Martin Sheen) is 25 and and works as a garbage-man in the boring smalltown of Fort Dupree, South Dakota. They meet and become a couple, they sleep with each other, roam around, and as Holly's father forbids her the relationship, Kit shoots him. Fleeing into the Badlands of Montana, they commit more murders on their way there. They lead a primitive life in seclusion until they are discovered…\n\nTerrence Malick is an enigmatic and legendary director, he made two movies in the 70's – ‘Badlands' and ‘Days of Heaven', and then disappeared from the screens for 20 years until his comeback with ‘The Thin Red Line' in 1998. Malick's first feature-length film Badlands is an extraordinary debut, based on the real story of the ‘Mad Dog Killers'. He stages the story of two outsiders as a highly aesthetic ballad. The setting- small towns, deserted and endless country roads, and the refuge of the two- all is bathed in golden sunlight. The film celebrates these landscapes in overwhelmingly beautiful pictures that seem to exude heat and dust. Malick used up three camera-men to realize his vision of these landscapes.\n\nBut as romantically as the landscapes are depicted, as laconically is the story of the two teenagers told. ‘Badlands' is distanced and avoids any commentary. Kit and Holly are normal teenagers, albeit they are a bit apathic and seem to live in their own world . They are creatures that know no responsibility, their murders seem like a game to them, committed without emotions or compassion. For Holly, the dead are barely more real than the people she reads about in her film magazines. In her childlike, unreflected cruelty, she sometimes appears more threatening than Kit, who sometimes even touches you in his effort to meet the James Dean image.\n\nIt is a fascinating character study that Terrence Malick delivers here, a tale of two big, cruel children, who are too underdeveloped, emotionally too immature to understand their sexuality or murders.\n\nhttps://vinylwriters.com/badlands-terrence-malick-1973/",

            "content": "A pensive bloodbath scattered across the deserts of America.\n\nTerrence Malick's directorial debut Badlands (1973) is a dreamy road trip in which an adolescent teenage girl succumbs to the charms of an older boy hellbent on becoming a criminal wanderer. Badlands continues to influence directors and films alike for its grounded characters, stripped down camerawork, gritty realism, and distinguished apathy to violence. Badlands is simply brilliant art.\n\nMalick's direction is peerless as he allows genuine performances from his actors and natural lighting with a focused visual style. Malick may have influenced the Dogma 95 movement with Badlands' scenic setting, natural light, no visual effects, and intimate cinematography. Malick keeps the camera trained on Martin Sheen as his character unravels into an ever increasingly violent serial killer. Malick also highlights and holds on Sissy Spacek's innocent face to display her character's naive and childlike perspective.\n\nBadlands' score from composers George Tipton, Carl Orff, and James Taylor is stunning. Malick's choice of innocent and fanciful musical selections create an eerie vibe. Badlands features beautiful ethereal music that accomplishes cold blooded murder again and again. The innocence of the soundtrack likens itself to Spacek's teenage girl Holly with her wide open eyes that see everything. The music and her narration seemingly from the future or Heaven present an honest retrospective on her life. The childish and carefree music are playing during grotesque animal cruelty, desolate American landscapes, brutal apathetic gunshots, and Southern townsfolk. This is particularly subversive and disturbing as Carl Orff's music is often associated with children's educational programming. Badlands contains fantastic scoring that will stick with you like its stark imagery.\n\nMartin Sheen is outstanding and captivating as the serial killer Kit, who is a generally disaffected youth as well as a caring love interest. Sheen is fascinating because you empathize with him at first for feeling so bored and aimless in the beginning. But you witness his malaise turn into animal abuse, child kidnapping, and mass murder. Sheen's crazed eyes gazing into the Sun towards the end speak volumes. He provides the archetype for the youth of America that are on the verge of committing atrocity. I believe Badlands must have influenced Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, David Lynch's Wild at Heart, Michael Lehmann's Heathers, Tony Scott's True Romance or any number of future films with a similar theme.\n\nSissy Spacek is remarkable and hypnotizing as Holly. She is sweet and innocent like a child, but you quickly she is naive to the fact that her boyfriend is just using her. Sheen portrays his character as an apathetic narcissist driven to madness by paranoia and society. Holly is blown around alongside Kit like the wind without her own agency. Spacek is brilliant in depicting a young girl infatuated with her first boyfriend as she slowly realizes what he is capable of and how far he is willing to go to drop out of society.\n\nI have to mention Warren Oates is darkly genius in Badlands as Holly's father figure. His playful painter persona is offset by vicious sudden violence towards animals and an underlying threatening attitude. Oates accomplishes a lot with nothing but a few words and glares. I also really appreciated Ramon Bieri as the towering man Cato. His quiet performance is full of nuanced distracted other-worldliness. \n\nBadlands is just a fascinating film. It is fun and engaging with a breezy 94 minute run-time. Terrence Malick is the man that appears in the doorway for a neat cameo and the two little boys by the lamppost are Martin Sheen's children, Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez. What a thrilling crime tale and a beautiful dual character study. The shots of cars speeding down highways and Martin Sheen letting bullets fly are just as mesmerizing as Sissy Spacek's lost gaze.",

The film feels almost like a response to Bonnie and Clyde (1967) which glamorizes it's central murderous couples and the crimes they commit. Badlands alternatively causes us to be repulsed by the actions of Kit and to at many points understand that he is crazy and worthy of disgust. We can cheer for Kit's fate at the end of the film whilst also feeling ambivalent about Holly as a character because she stood by him throughout the majority of the film.\n\nSpacek gives the best performance that any actress has given in a Terrence Malick film by creating a character with childlike innocence who is still capable of introspection at crucial moments in the film. Her voice-over is alternately entertaining and horrifying as she tells us \"Kit told me I was the smartest 15 year old he had ever met\" and \"Kit was the most trigger-happy person I'd ever met.\" Sheen gives a performance on par with his much acclaimed turn in Apocalypse Now (1979) as a terrifying murderer obsessed with cultural figures such as James Dean. The inspiration for Sheen's character was real-life murderer Charles Starkweather and he is said to have studied the real life case in order to give an accurate performance.\n\nThere are several iconic shots in the film, from Sheen holding a gun nonchalantly whilst the sun sets behind him, Spacek opening her heavily lined eyes and the two of them dancing in a tree house in the middle of the desert. These have all been clearly orchestrated by Malick and his cinematographers and they have their intended effect as they stick in your mind, so beautiful that they could be placed in a picture frame and hung on your wall at home. It is exciting to see the origins of Malick's iconic visual style and this is one of his best films if only for the reason that he is able to combine this visual style with an interesting story set around a tight script.\n\nIt goes without saying that I would certainly recommend this film to anyone. For those unitiated to Malick this is a good jumping off point because it is more accessible than the majority of his work. For anyone who has seen only his more recent works this is a clearer, more pure Malick vision and stands among his best films. This and Days of Heaven (1978) are his most plot-based films and that makes them very watchable and intense, to some ranking this third would be sacrilege but I stand by my choice because I think Days of Heaven (1978) is his better early work and The New World (2005) is more emotionally engaging.",

The scenes in the wide open spaces of the American west are gorgeous, and director Terrence Malick serves them up to us one after another.  \n\nActing - 3/5 stars.  Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek are both strong, and well-cast.  Sheen is compelling in a low-key way (though let's calm down on the comparisons to James Dean), and it's hard to believe Spacek was 24 at the time.  On the other hand, none of the victims of this pair's crimes show any fear, much less terror.  Their collective performances are quite wooden, minimizing the reality and impact of the violence.  \n\nHonesty - 1/5 stars.  Have a look at the real Charles Starkweather's story.  We don't see Sheen strangling and stabbing a two-year-old baby, as Starkweather did.  We don't see his attempted rape, or various other acts of vicious cruelty.  Instead we see him killing people with shots to the chest, and not out of malice.  We see him essentially glorified, dancing with Spacek in front of the car's headlights to a Nat King Cole tune, philosophizing (\"Try to keep an open mind.  Try to understand the viewpoints of others.\" etc), and winning over members of the National Guard and law enforcement when caught, tossing them items from his jacket as if he's a rock star.  \n\nThe casualness of violence, the murder of people as if they're animals (which are also ill-treated in the film), America's fascination with gun-toting outlaws, and the ease with which we identify with a sociopath all seem to be a part of the point of film, but I don't think you can have it both ways - to go for that, and to not be authentic.  Instead it feels like a young man's fantasy version of a serial killer, and doesn't ring true.  \n\nI deduct a further half point because for me, it's not a subject that's all that pleasant or heartening to watch.  Perhaps that's why it has to be so sugar-coated - wrapped up in beautiful scenes, Spacek's gentle voiceover, and a kind treatment of the killer.",

Terrence Malick; the writer-director, as always, never disappoints on terms on executing his anticipated vision on screen with his keen sense of knowledge and passion towards cinema itself. The performance objective is where the wheels get stuck for despite of brilliant effort, Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek aren't as convincing as the script demands.

Weightless über die Musik Szene von Texas mit Christian Bale und Michael Fassbender hat er abgedreht. - Wie einen Groschenroman beschreibt Holly ihr Leben. \"Little did I realize, that what began in the alleys and back ways of this quiet town would end in the Badlands of Montana.\" Es ist ihre fragende Erzählstimme, die über dem ganzen Film von Terrence Malick verweilt. Manchmal scheint es so, als ob das menschliche Sein hinter der majestätischen Landschaft einfach verschwindet. Holly spielt gerade mit einem Twirling Stab als sie Kit begegnet. Er hat in einer Autowerkstatt gearbeitet. Sie ist fünfzehn, er 25 - vielmehr erfahren wir jedoch nicht über sein früheres Leben. Er nimmt Holly einfach mit und binnen zwei Tagen hat er ihren Vater abgeknallt und ihr Haus angezündet. Beide befinden sich auf der Flucht nach South Dakota. Terrence Malick erzählt eine im Grunde bekannte Geschichte. Ein kriminelles Paar auf der Flucht durch ein verwahrlostes Amerika. Malick filmt diese Verbrechen, ohne eine Bedeutung darin zu suchen. Er psychologisiert nie! Kit ist einfach ein attraktiver Psychopath, den Holly anhimmelt. Sie selbst ist noch ein Kind - ziemlich simpel und weltfremd. Ihre Odyssee beschreibt Holly in der dritten Person, so als ob alles, was geschieht, Schicksal ist. Holly lebt in einem dieser Landhäuser, die noch öfters in Malicks Werk auftauchen werden. Eigene Erinnerungen? Sein Paar wirft er nun von einer atemlosen Sequenz in die nächste. Sie hausenn im Wald und durchqueren die weiten Ebenen, die Great Plains, in einer Reihe gestohlener Autos. \"At the very edge of the horizon. We could make out the gas fires of the refineries at Missoula, while to the south we could see the lights of Cheyenne, a city bigger and grander than I'd ever seen.\" Badlands ist unbedingt einer der grössten Filme aus der New Hollywood Ära der frühen 70er! Malicks Debüt führt die Schauspieler Martin Sheen und Sissy Spacek ein, die beide noch unbekannt waren. Sheen kam aus dem TV, Spacek trat in ihrem zweiten Film auf. Sheen in Blue Jeans sieht aus wie einer der Rebellen der 50er, wie ein echter Filmstar! Spacek, mit roten Haaren und Sommersprossen, wirkt wie ein Mädchen, nicht wie eine Frau. Beide Figuren haben kaum Tiefe und das steht im Gegensatz zu ihrem Todestrieb. Zwei im Grunde uninteressante Menschen, die ohne Motivation eine Familie töten. \"Listen to your parents and teachers. They got a line on most things, so don't treat 'em like enemies\", kommentiert Kit seine Taten dümmlich. Er glaubt, seine Worte hätten nun eine Bedeutung, da er berühmt ist. In Wahrheit stehen aber weder Kit noch Holly im Mittelpunkt. Es sind die kleinen Vögel und Tiere, das Gras, wie es sich im Wind bewegt. Detailverliebt filmt Malick die Schönheit der Landschaft, so wie nur er das kann. Technisch gesehen ist Badlands ein Road Movie. Für mich ist es DAS Genre, der New Hollywood Bewegung. Ein Genre, dass sich allem, was auf dem Weg geschieht, öffnen kann. Konstant sind dabei nur die Reisenden. Kit und Holly fliehen ins Nirgendwo. Kit spricht vage davon, nach Norden zu wollen, Holly folgt ihm aus Liebe. Ein weiterer Grund, dass sie mit ihm geht, ist es, das Verbot ihres Vaters (Warren Oates) zu brechen. Dessen Tod, so scheint es, ist für Holly vor allem bequem. \"It hit me that I was just this little girl, born in Texas, whose father was a sign painter, who only had just so many years to live. It sent a chill down my spine and I thought where would I be this very moment, if Kit had never met me?\" Hatte ihre Existenz überhaupt je eine Bedeutung? Terrence Malick ist eine der wirklichen Hollywood Legenden. Ein Einsiedler. Wer seinen Namen googlet, entdeckt gerade mal eine Handvoll Bilder. Interviews mit Malick? Fehlanzeige. Ich denke, er ist schlicht und ergreifend eine Privatperson, der in seiner Arbeit aufgeht und ansonsten auf einer Ranch lebt. Vermutlich ist er glücklich ohne Publicity, einfach im Kreis von Freunden. Kollegen beschreiben ihn als freundlichen, heiteren Mann. Malick ist kein Intellektueller, sondern ein reiner Humanist. Bestimmt ist das der Grund, weshalb sein mittlerweile sieben Filme umfassendes Gesamtwerk (in mehr als vierzig Jahren!) so einzigartig ist!",

            "content": "Badlands is acclaimed director Terrence Malick's first film, and it's got most, if not all, of his trademarks-philosophical narration, long shots of the wilderness, a massive fire, and some good (but very restrained) performances. All that said, it feels like a second-rate Bonnie and Clyde. The characters have virtually no personality, which makes developing any emotional connection with them an incredibly difficult task. So we're left to feel repulsed by them, just waiting for one character to wake up and the other to get caught or offed. And that's a problem I just couldn't get past no matter how much I admired the direction or acting.\n\nHolly (Sissy Spacek) is a 15-year-old student in rural South Dakota when she meets Kit (Martin Sheen), an unemployed James Dean look-a-like who is smitten with her from the outset. She slowly falls for him, as well, but it's without the permission of her father (Warren Oates). After he finally forbids Holly and Kit from seeing each other, Kit decides to kill him and run away with Holly. They live in the woods, reading about their status as fugitives, until some bounty hunters head their way. After dispatching of them, it's on the road once again, with no real destination in mind, a pile of corpses to their names, and growing celebrity status across small town America.\n\nBadlands' greatest strength ultimately leads to its greatest weakness. By keeping us at arm's length from the characters, we're able to thoughtfully consider Holly and Kit's motives and figure out why these two simple, seemingly ordinary individuals follow the path they do. In doing so, however, we never feel for them. We don't like them or feel pity for them. We don't even hate them all that much. We just watch and wonder. It's intellectually stimulating, but never feels satisfying.\n\nMalick's unique style is evident here, though perhaps not as defined as it will be in later films. He loves to linger on little things, images that are often haunting and meaningful. The setting is probably Malick's least picturesque, but he does a fantastic job making Badlands visually interesting with the budget he had to work with (reportedly less than $500,000).\n\nThe performances are great, when you realize what Malick is trying to accomplish. However, my issue with screenplay extends to the acting also. Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek are two great actors, and they inhabit their roles completely-but why no emotion? Not even in the film's final throws does one of these individuals show an ounce of anything. It didn't bother me that they did bad things, nor did it bother me that they never really regret their actions. I just wanted to understand them a little more. And if there really wasn't anything there, then I'm not sure this story is really worthy of a motion picture.\n\nUltimately, Badlands was pretty forgettable. Try as I might, I just could not get past the distance between myself and the characters. Parts of the film worked (I liked the sequence in which Kit and Holly lived in the wilderness), but on the whole, I never truly cared about anything that was going on. So Malick's debut is a disappointment. Not to worry, however; He finds his footing later.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/badlands-review/",

Simple. Simple characters, although messed up. Simple dialogue, Simple incidents. Kinda reminds me of Fargo.

            "content": "He is 25, she 15.   He looks just like James Dean, and is the most handsome man she has ever seen.  She is quiet and introspective, the kind of girl he likes not for sex but because talking is easy - she's not giggly like all the other teenage girls of the area.  Theirs is a love affair beginning as something sweet, but turns into something more deadly after it progresses.  Shortly after they first meet, they become the targets of a manhunt, wanted for shooting down six people in the sweltering North.\n\tThey are Kit (Martin Sheen) and Holly (Sissy Spacek), individuals who have grown up as loners but find each other whole in the presence of the other.  Kit is a garbage man without much initiative; Holly is a schoolgirl who lives with a single father (Warren Oates) in a very American neighborhood.  They meet for the first time when Kit spots Holly twirling a baton in the middle of the street.  From there does a relationship flower, with Kit just a little more into Holly than Holly is into him.  Young and foolish, she likes the attention, but doesn't really know what love is herself.\n\tTheir (or at least his) attachment soon begins to get serious, but not in the ways we would expect - maybe a frowned-upon elopement would be more predictable.  But Kit proves himself not to be the faux bad type James Dean was in \"Rebel Without a Cause\": without warning, he breaks into Holly's house and shoots her father.  Now, he tells himself and his true love, we can finally be together.  They burn down the house and hit the road, heading wherever the highway takes them so long as they don't end up somewhere near the fuzz.\n\tAt first, Holly isn't much bothered that Kit has taken away most of her life.  She'd rather be with someone who likes her than live the rest of her existence lonely and moral, and so she sees the death of her father as a sacrifice for her transformation from often ignored student to drooled over lover.  But skepticism intensifies as Kit's trigger happiness doubles in what you'd expect from your average outlaw.  Within just a few days, he has killed several people, dubbing them as potential witnesses for rationalization.  A crime spree it is, just without the glamour of a tawdry tabloid story.\n\tThough \"Badlands\" often feels like one.  Backed with poetic narration by Spacek, the events that unfold are frequently repositioned as nostalgic stories of the past, us imagining a future Holly sitting in a rocking chair with her grandkids, reminiscing about the dangerous life she lived in her youth with a man she used to know.  The directorial debut of Terrence Malick, whose acclaimed and hiatus driven career has enforced an elusive persona, \"Badlands\" is a lusciously photographed, subtly meaningful, and profoundly cinematic crime film that doesn't much feel like a crime film; it is more reasonable to call it euphonious take on the beauty of young love, and how its many descents into the self-indulgent and the foolish can lead to trouble both romanticized and bleak.  Heightened is its sense of regret, considering that Kit and Holly's misadventures are illegal and not merely mistakes of teenage motivation.  But that doesn't change the way \"Badlands\" transcends the genre it emulates, so dreamy and so ornate that we find ourselves to be much more fixated on our emotional reaction to its images and its aesthetic merit than on Kit's sickening actions, the way Holly is too saucer-eyed and out-of-touch to realize that the situation is too dire to think of oneself.\n\tAnd yet, \"Badlands\" feels epic and histrionic, juxtaposing its small size and conceptual basis.  Malick's gift for imagery is dynamic in the way the film touches us, immeasurably bombarded by gorgeous landscape shots and the photographic caressing of the bodies and faces of Sheen and Spacek, who are perfectly cast (he fitting as the young outlaw handsome but thoughtless, she the innocent willing to go along for any ride that involves her being liked for once in her life).  Every frame is like a photograph, irreproachably lensed to highlight the sun-soaked sublimity of the Montana Badlands.  The visually opulent idealization of the existence of outlaws is supremely captivating; we see \"Badlands\" as a blood-soaked fairytale, so cinematographically alluring that it's easy to forget how serious its content is.\n\tBecause maybe \"Badlands\" is a love story gone wrong, a darkened embodiment of the American Dream, an unromantic notion of what it means to be Bonnie and Clyde lite.  What happens when the girl you love is only with you out of aimlessness, when simplistic routine is less fetching than criminalization, when being on the lam is more tiring than it is carefree? \"Badlands\" is a game-changer, a depiction of ordinary life gone melodic and violent.  Its characters unremarkable, it makes a pulp story ring with supple understatement.  Certainly, it is one of the most important films of the 1970s, and nobody delivers cinematic poetry better than Malick.",

            "content": "1973 was a year that provided some iconic movies like \"American Graffiti\", \"The Exorcist\", \"The Sting\", and \"Mean Streets\". But out of nowhere an inexperienced filmmaker created a film that managed to hold its own against the other classics of said year. Terrence Malick´s feature length debut \"Badlands\".\nThe year is 1959, a 25 year old garbage collector called Kit Carruthers befriends a 15 year old girl called Holly Sargis. Eventually the couple start a romance, but Holly´s father rejects the idea of Kit dating his teenage daughter. Holly thinks they can continue their relationship in secret but what she ignores that Kit is capable of committing questionable acts in order to be with her. \nWhen it comes to Terrence Malick, you either interested in watching a film that has his name or you purposely avoid it for the same reason, due to his unconventional storytelling (heavily philosophical and almost always religious), and while I admire his style and find it incredibly beautiful to watch, I find it challenging to get into his stories, as he is the definition of style over substance. Having said that, I must admit that \"Badlands\" took me by surprise. \"Badlands\" counts with solid performances by both of its protagonists, a beautiful cinematography that shows the beginning of Malick´s style, an interesting amoral protagonist, Malick´s directing is reminiscent of his tutor Arthur Penn (not surprising considering the plot presented is a juvenile version of Bonnie and Clyde), the storytelling is surprisingly straightforward for a Malick film, some of the dialog is almost poetic, an extremely peculiar and shockingly somewhat believable romance, themes that are extremely well handled to the point of being opened to interpretation as any moviegoer can see something different regarding its overall meaning, a perfect use of music/score, and a story that isn't about a young couple reminiscent of Bonnie and Clyde, but a bloody and amoral fairy tale seen through the eyes of innocence (like a violent character study of Rome and Juliet). My only issue with this film is the ending, as it feels rushed and isn't that satisfying. \n\"Badlands\" is one of the most intriguing directorial debuts you can find. It is a beautiful, violent, unforgettable, poetic and fascinating character study disguised as a fairy tale. Arguably Malick´s best film to date, and undeniably his most easy to get into.",

Holly is largely an agentless, emotionless child dragged along for the ride. Both adopt personas built on popular iconography, playing house and performing their relationship in an attempt to play out the fantasies they've had or seen in the media they've consumed, casting mythological shadows in service of the larger ideas present. Through their experience, Malick distills everything about American life into the film's brief 90 minutes, a physical representation of America's unrestrained id (guns, blue jeans, sprawling landscapes, masculinity and femininity), unearthing the underlying evil of American romanticism in the process.",

Malick's fingerprints are all over this, and the monologue, his love of nature, his distinct cinematic accent, so to speak, is powerfully present. The burning of Holly's house, visually stunning and accompanied by powerful use of music, for example, foreshadows Malick's knack for incorporating music to stunning effect. A late film car chase is viscerally propulsive, exciting and utilizes dust clouds in remarkably artful ways. Kit, Sheen's character, is terrifying in a way that inclines me to think that \"No Country For Old Men\" and \"The Dark Knight\" owe Malick some thanks.\nThe film's undoing, for me, is a lack of a cohesive unifying vision or theme. For all of \"Badland\"'s visceral punch, one is left befuddled as to what it was all for or about. Of course, Malick is classically cryptic, but as one who adores his other works, \"Badlands\" seems to lack rather than conceal. Also, Holly's character is horribly unbelievable in her reactions. Would anybody react so coldly to their father's death? Unless Malick was really playing up her unintelligence. Regardless, the film felt rather unfocused in tone. Overall, however, this is essential viewing for fans of cinema who want a look into a heavily influential film that pushed Malick, and modern film, into what he/it is today.",

They excel as the naive country kids in love who stumble into a crime spree and towards an inevitable doom (if not American infamy).\n\nGreat music (see use of classical piece \"Schulwerk\"). It's somewhat whimsical tone juxtaposes the grim realities of the crime spree. The film also sports one of the rare instances of narration that actually feel useful with its presentation of Spacek's flowery, if matter-of-fact, telling of the couple's story -- becoming a staple for Malick's films in the process. Also of note is the wonderful photography, which paints both the natural beauty, as well as the more realistic, industrial backdrop of the midwest.  \n\nNever boring, the film is paced quite well. Even in slower moments, the drama keeps one glued to the screen as he dreads, and even anticipates, the couple's inevitable capture. \n\nMajor points to Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek.

He meets Holly a young teenager who spends her time studying and skipping the rope while waiting for her dad to come home from work.\nShe looks innocent and almost unconsciously careless about the consequences she is going up against through the actions she takes during the movie also determined by pure instinct.\n\nThe killing begins when her father opposes to their love. Kit is 10 years older and a street boy with not a real prospective that could secure her daughter well being.\nSo in the attempt to flee away with Holly, Kit shots her father dead in front of a passive Holly; from then on killing anyone who stands between them. Holly is an unassertive character that never pulls the trigger but also never opposes. She is shut down from materialism and opinions. She is free of judgment  \"I feel the world is far away\".\n\nThe  world we ought to aspire to or to comply to.\n\nThe movie uses the characters to express a sense of malcontent in humanity and especially the young generations that are unwillingly and unconsciously forced to follow the mass, to know how to live, where it seems that pulling the trigger for your country seems more accepted than killing for freedom of Love.\n\nThey are focused to care for each other which is portrayed without morbidity the exact contrary of how they relate with the 'others' where the relations ends in an almost innocent  and cruel act of killing without any remorse or doubts. \n\nOf course  \"The gun\" is just a metaphor to what is right or wrong of power and beliefs.\n\nFor what would you pull the trigger for ? Or drive out of the road to get over the mountain ? What's your objective ? Would you risk it all knowing it's against human laws ? Would you still keep cool ?

            "content": "Terrence Malick's stunning debut feature Badlands ranks among his finest works. Featuring brilliant performances by Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek, who have great chemistry on camera, Badlands is a violent tale that manages to be toned down by an easy atmosphere that is one of Malick's signatures, by telling a story with a simple, yet friendly narrative provided by Spacek. Badlands is a tense picture that is quite riveting from start to finish, and Malick captures every tense, thrilling and unforgettable scene through his camera, and pains a graphic, atmospheric portrait of two psychos on a killing spree. Now I must admit, I never was a diehard fan of Malick's work because he tends to make movies that are for a specific audience and they tend to be a tad slow in the way the story unfolds, but visually they've always been stunning, and his style was unique. However I found that most of films were far too ambitious and lacked any memorable story. I'm not saying that I think Malick is a bad filmmaker, quite on the contrary, but I'm simply saying that his work is not for everyone and for me, I've found it hard to find one of his films to really grab my attention. However that's not the case with Badlands, and this is the second feature of Malick's that I've enjoyed, the first being The New World. Badlands is really the easiest film of his to get into, and if you're not into artful pictures, the type of cinema that Terrence Malick is so keen on tackling, then this film is the perfect place to start. The tone of the film is somewhat cheerful, but it works as a way to hide the true nature of the plot, which is absolutely genius in the way that Malick does it. While maintaining of somewhat innocent narrative throughout, Malick is able to grab your attention and you hooked through the two lead characters journey into chaos as they go into their killing spree. Badlands is a great film, and some viewers may disagree but I personally feel that it's Terrence Malick's masterpiece.",

            "content": "\"Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important am I?\"\nO primeiro filme de Terrence Malick foi também o mais comercial da sua obra cinematográfica. Ainda assim, encontram-se já presentes algumas das suas marcas distintas que levaram o realizador a trilhar um caminho divergente no panorama do cinema americano. Essas marcas estão sobretudo relacionadas com a preferência por um estilo visual muito rico e vibrante, que compensa, de certa forma, a ausência de um dinamismo constante na narrativa.\nA história de Badlands introduz-nos dois protagonistas muito peculiares que, à partida, não teriam nada em comum. Ela, Holly, é uma jovem adolescente com uma vida pacata que vive sozinha com o seu pai. Ele, Kit, é um homem sem rumo aparente, que salta de emprego em emprego, sem nada a longo prazo que o faça encarar a vida de forma menos libertina. Quando Kit encontra Holly, forma-se uma estranha relação entre ambos, sucedendo-se depois uma viagem pelas terras ermas de Dakota do Sul, na qual vão deixando um rasto de sangue. Inspirado em factos reais, Badlands é muito mais do que uma simples encenação de crimes que assolaram a América, dedicando-se sobretudo à exploração dos ténues limites que separam a sociedade daqueles que repudiam a sua essência.\nTerrence Malick filma tudo com uma mão suave, pintando os cenários com as suas tonalidades sépias que se adequam perfeitamente ao ritmo da acção. Há estilo e há substância.\nQuanto a filmes semelhantes, God Bless America, assinado pelo não menos excêntrico Bobwyn Goldcat - quem não se lembra das sua desvairada personagem na saga Academia de Polícias -, é capaz de ser uma opção mais fácil de digerir, preterindo a substância face ao estilo.\nSão ambos recomendados!\nBadlands merece ainda uma nota adicional de destaque: a sua esplendorosa banda sonora original, a qual inspirou o conceituado Hans Zimmer a fabricar uma das gravações mais reconhecidas no seu reportório; falo claro, de You're So Cool, música do filme True Romance (1993).",

            "content": "Well, this was refreshing. Terrence Malick has always seemed like a pretentious douche to me, and clearly takes way too much stock in his work (like Paul Thomas Anderson... but at least Malick has a reason to). However, there's a thing called separating the man from the art. And thankfully, I have found it in my heart (no offense Leo) to do this here. Badlands is a beautifully filmed, enriching, perfectly acted, and all-around spectacular film that represents one of the biggest achievements in American cinema to date, and one that has been endlessly copied and half-heartedly (no offense Leo again) reproduced. But none of these blatant thefts of Malick's vision (yeah Refn, I'm looking at you) come even remotely close to gracing the heights of this near-masterpiece.\r\n\r\nBadlands stars Sissy Spacek as Holly Sargis, a spacy (no pun intended) young girl from Texas who falls in love with a mysterious young man named Kit (Martin Sheen). After her father tells Kit not to see her again, he shoots him and kills him, leading the two off on a long and drawn-out killing spree across the midwest. This concept has been done before, but what makes the movie so spellbinding is its surreal approach to such a simple subject. Spacek doesn't ever really exhibit any emotions as Holly, but that makes everything even creepier-- one starts to wonder why exactly she went off with Kit. She clearly doesn't love him, at least not as much as one should in order to go across country killing people with them. What's terrifying is that she goes along with him just because she's in the mood for an adventure. And people who look for adventures in the wrong places usually end up having shit like this happen to them.\r\n\r\nSheen, of course, delivers a great performance as Kit (what a shock). His cold-blooded approach to life is both unnerving and extremely fun to watch. Unlike other supposedly \"unpredictable\" characters in movies (ooh, the Joker is so unpredictable, like that time when he bombed a bus or that time when he bombed a boat or that time when he bombed a hospital. You just have no idea what he might do next!), he really is an enigma, never letting on his true intentions and ending his massacre with a disconcertingly passive finale. He could have held out far longer, but all he ended up doing is deciding that he was bored with it all. At its core, the movie is about two people who have no meaning in their lives, so they decide to go around ending the lives of others. Some people will call this unrealistic, some will call it surreal. I think it's far more realistic than any of us care to admit.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography, of course, is stunning. The heartland has never been captured so perfectly as it is in this film. Incredible shots of the desert, mountains, and run-down shitty little towns are played over an ethereal and enchanting soundtrack. It's quite an experience, in that it's both a complete explosion of visual talent, but also a calm and collected film that goes about its business with care and precision. You'll be knocked out of your seat by the sheer force and audacity of the talent displayed both in front of and behind the camera. Often, a film will pay too much attention to the cinematography, the acting, or the script (although nowadays it's almost always the special effects) and completely neglect another element of the movie. But Badlands neglects nothing, giving us a dazzlingly surreal story, a memorable script, spectacular performances, and mind-blowing cinematography.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Badlands: 9/10 stars. So after this fanboyish movie nerd rant, why is it not a full-fledged 10? Well, its surrealistic qualities get old after a while, especially when Spacek sees her father shot right in front of her and kind of just shrugs it off. \"Eh, no big deal, this guy shot my dad. I guess I'll run off into the middle of nowhere with him... nothing better to do.\" Some of these things can be explained away by the shallowness of the characters, and some can't. For instance, why did a deaf woman answer the door when they rang the bell? How did she hear? And if her boss sent her to answer the door... why would you send a deaf woman to answer the door anyway? It doesn't matter; all is forgiven. This movie is such a warped and ingenious vision, I can overlook minor quibbles such as that. It's a must-see.",

As comical it may seem, this is probably Malick's most mainstream of a film, where later on in his career would he dare delve into the existential crises that would plague his characters. Taking a spin off the Bonnie and Clyde anti-heroes, Malick's main couple (Kit and Holly) are neither evil nor good, they simply wish to be together without the modern influence of America knocking on their doorstep. Alas, as Kit (Martin Sheen) turns to violence by being the main instigator in the shooting and mayhem as they reap across the American landscape (captured gloriously and magnificently by Tak Fujimoto, Steven Larner and Brian Probyn). Meanwhile Holly (Sissy Spacek) serves as both the narrator and assailant to Kit's acts. While not physically being involved, she remains as emotionally detached and unsympathetic to the victims that fall prey to their madness. It's an amazing performance from her as she retains the adolescent and perception of a child as she is not only overwhelmed by the magnitude of the situation, but can't comprehend the gravity of it. What a subtle performance she gives! The film is deliberately slow, and what an incredible decision on Malick's part. For not intensifying up the thrills and violence, but letting it be steady, dead-silent, and all the more haunting, we get a perfect perspective on the acts this film is supposedly based on in real life. Beautifully executed, visually poetic, and persistently eerie as we follow the deranged couple, BADLANDS is one of the finest American films to grace the silver screen, and a brilliant debut by Malick, who would continue to this streak of brilliance in his future projects.

Kit and Holly are two of the most interesting characters I have ever seen in a film, and Badlands is a film that is as authentic and unique as they come. Kit is a somewhat charming psychopath who acts basically on whim, and Holly is a child who has no idea what she really wants. They are characters who seem different from any real person, and in the world they inhabit they feel alienated, but in fact, they are just like everyone else, lost in this world and unsure of what to do at all. Kit kills many people, but it is unclear whether he really understands that he is taking a life, lives are not of great importance to Kit, because his life doesn't really matter to himself. And it is clear that Holly doesn't understand that Kit is actually killing people, she never describes Kit as killing anyone, she always says he shoots people. Death is not really a knowable thing for these characters, because how can it be, even to us in reality, we may think we understand what death means, but we don't, and this is obvious with Kit and Holly. There is no meaning in any of their actions, but their actions have lofty consequences, which make them something that has value, and this is more than they hoped for back at home. However, they are headed to nowhere, they have no destination and no goal, there is still no meaning to what they do, and it always is overshadowed by the beauty of nature. Malick in his debut shows us the distinctive style of art film he wanted to make, we see how insignificant we are compared to the enormity and sheer beauty of nature. There is a shot towards the end of the film, where Kit is standing on the plains with the shotgun behind his head; he is looking at a storm come in beside a peaceful sunset, he is bewildered and confused, and as he walks back towards the camera he looks tiny in comparison to nature; he moves closer and closer to the camera, but never seems to get any larger. This is an example of the visual poetry Malick uses, he shows us how we see nature; we see its power and we see its harmony, but we can't figure out where we fit in, so we just walk away feeling small.",

It is a film I might never recover from, like all of Terrence Malick's films, Badlands aims to get personal with its audience. Badlands has officially entered my top ten favorite films ever made. Chilling, haunting, sublime, and enigmatic, Badlands is a blessing.\n\nIt is a film about a savage murder spree and the lovers who went through with it. Kit and Holly, played incredibly well by Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek, are the lovers on the run, killing anyone they see fit, all the while remaining charismatic, likable, and most of all, relatable. Just imagine if the films of Quentin Tarantino actually had soul. My interest in the films of Quentin Tarantino dwindles more and more as the years go by. I've come to the conclusion that the man is not only a hack but a thief, and his crimes against Badlands did not go unnoticed nor can they ever by forgiven or forgotten.\n\nIf I could pick one word to describe the films of Terrence Malick, it would have to be 'poetry'. Badlands is one of the cinema's boldest and most chilling poems. I could go on forever about how I analyzed the film but these 'films of the day' are meant to be brief, so I'll spare myself the time and energy I'd spend on writing something that will never actually be read. Just know that the film is brilliant, in every single aspect, one the my favorite films of all time, and the best directorial debut ever. Beautiful and intimate, Badlands is a true treasure.\n\nBare with me while I praise Martin Sheen. He was just incredible in the film. Badlands' Kit is quickly becoming one of my all time favorite screen characters. Sheen was extraordinary, and has definitely proven that he was one of the best actors of the seventies, and that's a pretty big accomplishment once you consider his contemporaries. I absolutely loved his performance. Great talent.\n\nThe film is otherworldly, maybe even mystical. A visual poem full of lyrical beauty. I believe that Badlands best represents American cinema of the seventies. There is an intimacy that no other film, aside from maybe Malick's other ventures, has been able to match. An amazing film that I recommend to everyone I know. A top ten mainstay for me, and a film that like none other. An addictive film, I can watch Badlands over and over again, and I do.",

Martin Sheen in chains, tossing collectibles from his pockets - a comb, a lighter, a pen - the police men gawking up at this shackled superstar.  The film is absolutely beautiful, the midwest has never looked so good.  And Malick captures the isolation and farmland mentality perfectly.  Warren Oates for his short screentime feels like he stepped right out of my own family's North Dakota homestead.  Martin Sheen has that desperation for attention, to break free from the prison of the middle-of-nowhere.  But it's Sissy Spacek's tagalong killer that mystifies me.

To date, one of the most gorgeous scenes on film is where Kit and Holly dance to Nat King Cole's \"A Blossom Fell\" under a starlit sky while car headlights lead their steps. Romantic, irreverent and innocent. This is one of those films I delight in sharing with others.",

Its very unlike the way a film of this genre is made. This film explores the innocence, naivetÃ (C) & the brutality of the incident in a laidback fashion that in the end you feel a twinge of sympathy for them. And that is what makes this film a masterpiece, because it doesnt judge them. \n4.5/5",
