    "summary": "Real-life father and daughter Ryan and Tatum O'Neal team up as slick con-artists Moses Pray and Addie Loggins in 1930s Kansas. When \"Moze\" is unexpectedly saddled with getting the 9-year-old Addie to relatives in Missouri after the death of her mother, his attempt to dupe her out of her money backfires, and he's forced to take her on as a partner. Swindling their way through farm country, the pair is nearly done in by a burlesque dancer (Madeline Kahn) and an angry bootlegger.",

            "content": "Bright, funny and warm, road movie/caper film.  This follows the misadventures of Depression-era orphan Addie Loggins and her con artist father Moses Pray; expertly played by real life daughter-and-daddy team Tatum and Ryan O'Neal.  Tatum famously won an Oscar for her turn as the feisty, foul-mouthed street urchin Addie; still setting a record for the youngest Oscar winner ever at age 10.  She and her father have marvelous screen chemistry; as they drive throughout the Great Dust Bowl of the Midwest, conning widows into buying Bibles; and getting in and out of trouble with their schemes.  Indeed, Tatum's powerhouse performance as Addie Loggins-Pray, who is a cross between Huckleberry Finn and the Artful Dodger; is really why this movie is so famous and noteworthy. This might just be the best screen performance by a child actor ever!  It's right up there with Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense, Linda Blair in the Exorcist, Jack Wild in Oliver, Anna Paquin in The Piano, Henry Thomas in E.T. and Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz.  The immaculately detailed and precise period piece evocation by Peter Bogdonovich is really pretty stunning here; this really looks like an MGM Our Gang short from 1934!  Bogdonovich also purposefully references movies like Grapes of Wrath to summon up the Depression and all it's horrors as a backdrop to the comedy.  And if you look closely Ryan is modelled after a mustachioed Charlie Chaplin in The Kid (1921); and Tatum is his screen partner, Jackie Coogan.  There is nary a false moment to be found in the entire movie.  The plot; which is divided into three acts; unfolds in a leisurely pace and crescendos to a tense finale; as the Prays' con game keeps escalating and upping the stakes; until the ending when the jig is up, and it all comes to a boiling point.  The story is fiercely entertaining, hilarious and touching at every step in the game.  Having a real live Daddy-Daughter-Dinner-Dance as the centerpiece is crucial to the movie's effectiveness.  By comparison, the tv show, which stars Jodie Foster and Christopher Connelly, can never really touch this movie in terms of hilarity, pathos and bittersweet moments; because it's not a real father-and-daughter team.  (Another movie which comes to mind, and which very effectively uses this nepotism gimmick is On Golden Pond; which brilliantly capitalizes on the real and public family strife between Jane Fonda and her father Henry).  Paper Moon is just about a perfect movie; it's really hard to find any fault with anything here.  Bogdonovich and the O'Neals have effectively elevated this light caper comedy to an epic road movie for the ages.   Probably one of the best movies ever made; and definitely a family classic.  Highly recommend!",

            "content": "Peter Bogdanovich's Paper Moon feels very much like a companion piece to his classic from a few years earlier, The Last Picture Show.  Like its predecessor, Paper Moon is a story about relationships set to the backdrop of dire economic despair. Conman Moses Pray (Ryan O'Neal) travels across Depression-era Kansas, selling Bibles to widows under false pretenses.  After attending the funeral of a former lover, he finds himself saddled with Addie (Tatum O'Neal), the daughter of the deceased, committed to delivering her to relatives in nearby Missouri.  Filled with beautiful black and white cinematography courtesy of Laszlo Kovacs, great period details, and some razor-sharp dialogue, the main reason to watch Paper Moon is the incredible performance of Tatum O'Neal, who plays the role of the Addie with the confidence of a seasoned actress, despite the fact that Paper Moon was her screen debut.",

            "content": "It says a lot when you can make such likable, and even sympathetic, characters out of two depression era con artists.\n\nRyan O'Neal was enagingly enjoyable and, while taking a back seat to his daughter in the praise department, his performance was an integral component of the film's success. He showed great timing in his delivery and somehow made himself quite likable as he committed scam after scam, all while corrupting a minor.\n\nI was well aware of the praise for the younger O'Neal's performance as she famously won the supporting Oscar and yet she still was able to surpass my high expectations. She exhibited such an impressive range, creating laughs one minute, with her tough cigarette smoking bravado, while tugging at my heart strings the next as her childhood evaporated for her, much quicker than it does for most.\n\nThe pacing of this film was excellent and it went by in a flash with the absorbing cinematography and the black and white color creating a world that was easy to lose yourself in. The dialogue was light and witty at times leading to a handful of chuckles and a couple of laughs, which balanced well with the more serious emotional dynamics that positively add dramatic weight to any film. It would actually be hard to pin a film like this down to a genre as there were elements of many, blended so well, as they often are in some of the best movies. 8.5/10\n\n*Thanks, great recommendation Alex!",

His efforts to cheat the clever child out of money backfires, and he's coerced into taking her on as a partner. Together, the father-daughter duo swindle their way through 1930s Kansas.\n\nI have never seen a black-and-white film that was more colorful and vivid than \"Paper Moon\". This film was curiously nostalgic, somehow driving me to reminisce back to a time where I wasn't even born! Only the greatest filmmakers are able to capture a moment and make that moment timeless. That's what separates movies from cinematic masterpieces. \"Paper Moon\" had a plethora of those timeless moments.\n\nThe casting of real-life father and daughter, Ryan and Tatum O'Neal, was right on the ball. Tatum O'Neal's performance as Addie Loggins was exceptional. As child actors go, she remains one of Hollywood's most cherished nearly fifty years later. With Madeline Khan's uproarious performance thrown in, this cast is irrefutably priceless.\n\nClever, charming, and exhilarating are but a few words to describe the picture.

What could be more stereotypically American than taking advantage of widows by selling them fake personalized Bibles supposedly from their dead husbands, names combed form obituaries, taking advantage of their sadness, religious nature, and ego for personal gain? That's practically a Twain caricature transplanted to the Depression. Much like Twain, Bogdanovich deftly combines metaphor and objectivity in his dual criticism and celebration of the American spirit with a sense of comedy to create a pithy and enjoyable film. Championed by a pair of very solid lead performances from both Ryan and Tatum O'Neal, the fim delivers plenty of sincerity and wit and remains on solid footing. (4/5)",

Honestly, I couldn't help thinking about Charlie Chaplin and Jack Coogan from The Kid!\n\nThe ending is a tad bit predictable, though. Nevertheless, the execution is pretty exquisite that kept me from being very sure about how the movie will end. Also, the ending is as heartwarming and sweet as the whole movie. So, it's not really a big problem.\n\nWhat amazed me is how smartly scripted this movie is. The way the problems are solved in the plot is genius. The main characters keep get in troubles a lot through their journey, and they get out of them in a convincing and intelligent way. But it's also silly and ridiculous at the same time to match the nostalgic approach that Peter Bogdanovich took from the get-go. That's really a lesson that many directors and screenwriters should learn nowadays; which is that when they decide to capture the essence of a bygone cinematic era, they have to make their film relevant to a modern audience by making it seem smarter and more sensible, hence more convincing.\n\nEvery sub-plot is consistent, amusing, and really adds to the characters and the main storyline. The sub-plot of Trixie also has no shortage of brilliance and fun, but I think it didn't need to be that long. It felt like that it was a pitfall that the screenwriter fell into, but didn't want to get out of it in an unconvincing and flimsy way so he had to take his time planning a reasonable and plausible way. That said, I enjoyed every second of this very sub-plot as much as the entire movie.\n\nPaper Moon is simply a thoroughly engaging, very moving and touching, quite charming, surprisingly clever and sincere ode to Depression-era road movies.\n\n(9/10)",

            "content": "Paper Moon is excellent at capturing the feel of an old classic film that takes place during the Great Depression. I love the choice to film in black-and-white because it just seems right for the style of movie. The marvelous thing they did in this movie was using an actual father-daughter pair, because you could feel the connection between the characters even when the events or dialogue in the film seemed to be driving them apart. I loved the 2 main characters so much, and it was nice how they were slowly growing closer and becoming more defined characters as the movie went on. It's kind of amazing how charming they can make a pair of crooks, yet you find yourself completely rooting for them to be successful. I think my only stumbling block in the movie was the entire sequence with Madeline Kahn. She is a simply amazing actress, so connecting her with any complaint feels foolish, but I just didn't like the way her presence broke up the flow of the film. It was as if there was this consistent journey I was taken on, and suddenly it took a detour into an extended sub-plot which didn't do enough to keep the main story going. If it were shortened or perhaps rewritten a little I think it might have worked, but as it stood, it was the one time when I started to lose interest. However, despite this slow section in the middle, I was completely in love with Paper Moon and I think it is a movie that most people would enjoy.",

The director's deep-seated appreciation for classic American cinema shines throughout, perhaps even more so than with his '30s screwball love letter What's Up Doc. In real life, former film critic Bogdanovich befriended and interviewed every lionized director from George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story) to Howard Hawks (Bringing Up Baby) to Leo McCarey (Duck Soup). And God, does it show. From Lazslo Kovacs' ace black and white cinematography to set designer Polly Platt's period detail to the choice of soundtrack (everything from The Jack Benny Program to the vintage tune \"Paper Moon\" fills your ears), the film feels as rooted in the Dust Bowl era as John Steinbeck. But then, it dares to channel 1970s sensibilities like foul language and talk of women's problems. \n\nIn this PG-rated Great Depression-set dramedy, a con man (Ryan O'Neal) finds himself saddled with a young girl (Tatum O'Neal) who may or may not be his daughter and the two forge an unlikely partnership. \n\nTatum O'Neal won the Oscar for this at-times both heartless AND heartfelt romp, but Paper Moon truly is Bogdanovich's show, staking a phenomenal follow-up to The Last Picture Show.\n\nBottom line: Moonstruck",

            "content": "There are a lot of reasons to see Paper Moon. And yet there are more reasons to enjoy the film, because Paper Moon proved pleasantly surprising to me.\n\nPaper Moon works as many things. But it is most predominantly a nostalgic venture and a charming comedy.\nThe style of Paper Moon, being shot with really classical cinematography techniques in black and white and acted as such is terrific manages to evoke a serious sense of nostalgia to the time of the film's setting, the depression era. And in that manner it reminds us of how different the time was as well as playing it to comedic effect in a charming film about it. \nThrough a convincing art direction team, the production design of the film is spot on, as is the many costumes. \nAnd the story is one that could only come from a context like it has and still be charmingly convincing and entertaining. Thanks to direction from Peter Bogdanovich it becomes the true best that it can be. While it is rather slow from time to time, Alvin Sargent's screenplay is consistently entertaining and funny in Paper Moon, as well as the fact that its language is ideal to the time the story is set in. And and with the strength of the cast by the side of the script, it comes out with full strength.\nThe cast is the main source of strength in Paper Moon, with the two leads giving unforgettable performances.\nRyan O'Neal has so much charm in the lead role in Paper Moon, because his performance is perfect in fitting in with the theme of nostalgia in Paper Moon. His performance is charmingly hilarious at times, and reminiscent of some of the greatest actors of the earlier ages of film. Classic actors such as James Stewart and Dick Van Dyke had the kind of charm that Ryan O'Neal has in Paper Moon, so he helps in ensuring that it is a very nostalgic venture as well as a showcase for his undeniable talent and charm. His line delivery is quick witted and intelligent, and he makes himself a truly great comedic lead in Paper Moon. I wouldn't have been surprised if he was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance, and I'm a little disappointed that he wasn't.\nTatum O'Neal has both the charm of a young child and the passion of a serious actress in Paper Moon, because even at such a juvenile age she displays that with her passion as an actress and as a young girl she can really dominate the screen with the charm in her line delivery and the real strength behind her physicality and facial gestures. Tatum O'Neal carries the story on her little shoulders and she never stumbles because she is constantly very charming and sympathetic, and it is honestly no real surprise that she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting actress for her part, the youngest person to ever win a competitive Academy Award.\nThe chemistry between Tatum O'Neal and Ryan O'Neal is one of the key sources of entertainment in Paper Moon. As they are a real life father and daughter, they have the kind of chemistry that unrlated actors simply cannot share. When they battle wits there is no person who has a higher ground, as Ryan O'Neal has the dominant physicality but Tatum O'Neal has the real wits in the situation. And as Paper Moon unfolds it's story more and more, their chemistry and relationship become all the more compelling. They have the kind of chemistry that Will Smith and Jaden Smith shared in The Pursuit of Happiness, but it's a lot more classic than contemporary so it is interesting too look back on in this age and contrast both films for the efforts of the familial actors in the film.\nMadeline Kahn also proves to give an effectively convincing effort, as she is attractive enough for the role and charming enough with her friendly line delivery and comedic efforts.\nAnd with a fine soundtrack to hit the atmosphere just right, Paper Moon is an easy film to watch with plenty of charm.\n\nPaper Moon proves itself as a comedy classic with dedicated acting and a nostalgic amount of charm.",

            "content": "With Great Whacks of Daddy Issues  \r\n\r\nMy absolute favourite Ryan O'Neal story is one that I'm quite sure Tatum wishes people would stop telling.  However, I think it says everything that needs to be said about their relationship--and Ryan O'Neal as a person.  You see, this isn't just the story about how he told her, probably right around the time this movie was made, that she shouldn't ask him to choose between her and Farrah Fawcett, because he wasn't sleeping with Tatum.  No, this was at Farrah Fawcett's funeral, where he needed a ride (Ryan O'Neal doesn't have his own car?), so Tatum gave him one--and he didn't recognize her, so he started hitting on her.  He laughs about this story; I can only assume that Tatum has told it to her therapist several times.  I also know that he was pretty mad when she won the Oscar and he wasn't even nominated for this.  Though he is one of the people who lost to George C. Scott, the year George C. Scott refused the award, so there's that.\r\n\r\nTatum is Addie Loggins and Ryan is Moses Pray.  Her mother has just died, and she believes that Moze is her father, which he denies.  He did, however, know her mother, and he agrees that he will take Addie to her aunt's house.  On his way out of town, he extorts two hundred dollars from the brother of the man whose drunk driving was responsible for Addie's mother's death.  Addie overhears this and refuses to separate from Moze until he gives her the money, most of which he's already spent.  It turns out that Moze is a low-level conman, and Addie quickly demonstrates a flair for it--better than Moze, in fact.  They're making her money back faster than he'd expected--until one night, at a carnival, he meets up with Miss Trixie Delight (Madeline Kahn).  Moze rapidly spends money on her, and of course, they aren't up to their usual tricks and so aren't getting any more in.  Addie decides she needs to get rid of Trixie, and pairs up with Trixie's maid, Imogene (P. J. Johnson), to do it.\r\n\r\nTo be perfectly honest, the only reason I can see Addie's wanting to stay with Moze is for the same reason that I assume she really loved her father at the time.  Sometimes, we are blind when it comes to our parents and forgive things that shouldn't be forgiven.  Addie is desperately in need of someone to love her, someone to belong to, and she latches onto Moze for it.  Possibly, her aunt (Rose-Mary Rumbley) would be better; we can never really be sure.  However, her aunt was distant, never visiting her sister and niece.  Addie can convince herself that Moze loved her mother, and that he must be her father.  Don't they have the same jaw?  Maybe he is; maybe he isn't.  But Addie needs him to be, so she's willing to overlook every flaw--and drive off Trixie.  She's a better judge of human nature than he is, but she still can't see him well enough to see what's wrong with him.  She doesn't want to, because she wants him to be the father she needs.\r\n\r\nOh, part of this may be that I just don't like Ryan O'Neal.  Of the four people who get any considerable amount of screen time in this film, he's the least talented.  It was Tatum's first movie, and she acted rings around him.  However, remember that he's perfectly content to scam people the same regardless of whether they're rich or poor.  She gives the poor woman the inscribed Bible and is smart enough to charge the rich one considerably more than anyone else they encounter--and the rich woman pays it without a second thought.  It isn't just that Moze is a crook.  It's that he's short-sighted.  He's petty.  He doesn't only think of himself, but that's because he doesn't seem to think at all.  He's trying to impress Trixie, but why?  (Leaving aside that she's Madeline Kahn and therefore automatically too good for him.)  when he meets her, she's a stripper at a carnival.  He seems to have the impression that she's high class, because she has a high school diploma, but how long will she stay when he's broke?\r\n\r\nFor some reason, this approximate era was full of rose-coloured portrayal of the Great Depression.  (For all this was actually filmed in B&W.)  Yes, all right, these two are supposed to fit in the category of \"cheeky rogues\" who have been popular in fiction going back quite a long time.  Centuries at least.  However, we don't ever get a clear image of poverty from this movie.  Several characters throughout the story must be in very bad shape financially, but we ignore that.  It takes a very small amount of money to convince Imogene to betray Trixie, and fair enough.  She doesn't like Trixie anyway and isn't getting paid.  But the money Moze cheats out of people will sometimes mean that they won't have enough to eat that month, and the movie never lets us see that anyone is ever really suffering.  Except for the one family wherein Addie, out of the goodness of her heart, refuses to con them.  That isn't enough for me, and I'm surprised it is for the movie's many fans.",

It actually feels like a film from the time its set (except for some of the more risque content), despite being released decades later.\nThe two lead performances are absolutely perfect, and they have a great chemistry with each other (no surprise seeing as they are real life father and daughter) that was a joy to watch.  When they argue, it's awkwardly funny; when they have moments of dramatic tenderness, it's heartwarming.\nThe black and white perfectly captures the mood, and the film just looks gorgeous.

Honorable mention to Imogene played by unknown P.J. Johnson who was the African-American assistant to hot-in-the-pants Trixie.  Trixie was \"your lady for a price\" that Moses picked up at a carnival.  Imogene had the best side character role and played it well.  Paper Moon was precisely what a buddy movie about grifting should be and what others have striven to be.  Holds up just as well now as it did 40 years ago.

The screenplay was adapted from the novel Addie Pray by Joe David Brown, and the film was shot in black-and-white.\r\n\r\n2   The film is set in Kansas and Missouri during the Great Depression. It stars the real-life father and daughter pairing of Ryan and Tatum O'Neal, as on-screen father and daughter Moze and Addie.\r\n\r\n3  The film was shot in the small towns of Hays, Kansas; McCracken, Kansas; Wilson, Kansas; and St. Joseph, Missouri.\r\n\r\n4    Various changes were made in adapting the book to film. Addie's age was reduced from twelve to nine to accommodate young Tatum, several events from the book were combined for pacing issues, and the last third of the novel, when Moses and Addie graduate to the big leagues as con artists after going into partnership with a fake millionaire, was dropped.\r\n\r\n[img]http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-liEi35RoAlY/Tzm3I5KawiI/AAAAAAAAFjs/NQ_pSkPkKKs/s1600/tatumoneal.png[/img]\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAWARDS\r\n\r\n\r\nTatum O'Neal won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Addie. She is the youngest winner in the history of the Academy Awards. \r\n\r\nCo-star Madeline Kahn was also nominated for that award that year but lost to Tatum. The film itself was nominated for Best Sound (Richard Portman, Les Fresholtz) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Alvin Sargent).\r\n\r\n[img]http://img2-3.timeinc.net/ew/dynamic/imgs/061208/124117__papermoon_l.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nCREW\r\n\r\nDirected by Peter Bogdanovich \r\nProduced by Frank Marshall\r\nPeter Bogdanovich \r\nScreenplay by Alvin Sargent \r\nBased on Addie Pray by\r\nJoe David Brown \r\nStarring Ryan O'Neal\r\nTatum O'Neal \r\nCinematography L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs \r\nEditing by Verna Fields \r\n\r\n[img]http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-63EUKUsPN0g/TmzflkEYMUI/AAAAAAAAANg/caTpH3alijY/s1600/papermoon.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAST\r\n\r\nRyan O'Neal as Moses \"Moze\" Pray\r\nTatum O'Neal as Addie Loggins\r\nMadeline Kahn as Trixie Delight\r\nJohn Hillerman as Deputy Hardin/Jess Hardin\r\nP.J.

Along the way Moses discovers that his 9-year-old travel companion is a better con-artist than he is. The two are more alike than either would dare to admit and eventually they form an odd but profound friendship. \n\nI'm not sure if it was the comforting familiarity of working with her father or if it was just a character perfectly suited for her talents, but Tatum O'Neil knocks my socks off every time I watch this movie.

They stop at tons of houses along the way to sell \"ordered bibles\", and soon enough Addy gets in on the act and gets them even more money. Just when she and Moze are getting close, he picks up prostitute Trixie Delight (Kahn) and her black maid (Johnson), which doesn't last long after Addy gets rid of them. Over the course of the next few days, she and Moze develop a father/daughter relationship which makes it even harder to say goodbye. Though an excellent film, \"Paper Moon\" is more famous because of Tatum O'Neal's Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress when she was only ten. Luckily, it isn't one of those movies that just has that one gimmick. Bogdanovich treats this follow-up to his gigantic movie \"The Last Picture Show\" just as equal and is just as good. Filmed in glossy black-and-white similar to the latter, the film creates an atmosphere that fits the 1930's just perfectly, along with the costumes and the few sets there actually is. Aside from this, the movie also boasts a very funny script, and of course excellent performances, which all make the film thrive. But Ryan O'Neal doesn't make the film especially great-- it's actually all do to both his daughter Tatum, and the other supporting actress Madeline Kahn that make this film so much more memorable. Tatum makes the film even better with her great performance, which is better than most you'll see from child actors, and Kahn shines in her hilarious role as well. \"Paper Moon\" is a tad bit overrated, but I still loved the look of the film, not to mention almost everything else.

Today we assume Hollywood would allow the payoff of the loving, traditional Missori home enveloping Allie and giving her religion, a piano and a family while here Bogdanovich says, screw that, I want cigarettes, hotel rooms and petty crime, sure some payoff is the being with dad thing but Paper Moon is more radical than that, Allie doesn't really have a character arc, she's tough, grown up and doesn't pine for childhood.

Bogdanovich recently impressed me with Targets, and once again here he proved his uncanny ability to bring the best out of his actors, with the father/daughter team of Ryan and Tatum O'Neal providing a real warmth and charm to their relationship as each of their characters look to fill the hole left in their lives. And while Ryan O'Neal is perfect as the con man, always looking for the next opportunity to make it rich and enjoy a taste of the ladies, it is Tatum who steals the movie with a flawlessly delightful performance as a young girl, not averse to being manipulative herself, who seeks a role model and somebody to care for her. It's a stunning performance and well worth her Academy Award, and teamed together with her father Paper Moon becomes a highly enjoyable and fun caper, an edge of the seat road movie and a truly entertaining film shot in some of the most stark imagery.",

After eavesdropping on a conversation, Addie is led to believe that she deserves $200 in compensation for her mother's death, and they both agree to endure a journey together until Moses raises the money to give to her.\r\n\r\nThe thing that really impressed me about the film, right off the get-go, is the overall feel of it. The title alone is borrowed from the name of a jazz standard from the 30's, \"It's Only a Paper Moon\". It's almost unbelievable that this film is one of the 70's, because it just feels like it should be from the Golden Age, even though it takes place in the not-so-glamourous midwest. This is contributed by not only the beautiful black-and-white cinematography, but also the charming acting performances and lack of a background score (minus the moments were jazz music could be heard via radio). I would have been completely dumbfounded of its era, if not for the crafty screenplay, which could have only come from the same decade that gave us Network and The Godfather. It just all seems so old-fashioned, like the classic old Hollywood films I love so much. This may or may not have biased me towards liking Paper Moon more than I normally would've, but that's where the film has its strong points.\r\n\r\nI could never bring myself to write an honest review of the film without mentioning one of my favorite things about it: the great acting performance by the young Tatum O'Neal. She plays the character of the tough-as-nails Addie with such an excellent amount of precision and poise; I do think she overshadows her father in this sense. In fact, such a splendid portrayal earned her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Although many do not think the win was completely her own (she was up against Linda Blair for The Exorcist), I do believe that her performance was special because it was not completely external. She was unmalleable when she needed to be, but also had her share of comedy and overall adorableness. After all, when it all comes down to is, she is but a little girl.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say that Ryan O'Neal's performance wasn't great. Though Moses did not have as many scene-stealing lines and shots as Addie, he was still shown as being charming, though still a bit of a wise guy. Not too far into the film, it is revealed how he makes a living: he looks up obituaries, and visits the deceased wives' homes, claiming to be a Bible salesmen. Though he is completely aware that they have died, he pretends to be oblivious of the fact and asks for their remaining payments on expensive books they have recently bought. Soon enough, Addie becomes involved in all of this. The buddy-buddy relationship between Moses and Addie is undeniable, and she soon becomes his \"partner in crime\", so to speak. Though this story could easily go on a predictable route and turn into a sentimental tearjerker, it avoids this at all costs. Granted, there are a few scenes that may come off as anticlimactic. Interestingly enough, though, the entire work in general is satisfying, maybe because it avoids these all-too-familiar film clich\u00e9s.\r\n\r\nThough I do believe this film is not necessarily one that everyone could love, there's not really too much to dislike about it. The black-and-white cinematography is stunning. The direction and mood gives it the atmosphere of a 30's masterpiece. At the same time, its spitfire screenplay is unique of its era, and is excellently crafted. The acting performances (primarily the debut role of Tatum O'Neal) are ones that cannot be passed up. And altogether, this is just a really cute father-daughter movie. It lacks the overt saccharine sweetness that could potentially drive it to corniness, yet is just so enjoyable. Fans of 1930's cinema could almost certainly appreciate Paper Moon, but even if this isn't the case, the average movie-goer can, more than likely, find a certain sense of satisfaction from this work of art.",

Like The Last Picture Show (1971), the world we see in Paper Moon reflects his vision masterfully. \nTwo things help Bogdanovich immensely craft his work. The first is work with his DP and what they decide to do with cinematography. Using natural light to full effect, they craft a stark and bleak picture that utterly matches depression era America. One only have to look at films of the era or photographs to see this. At the same time, the choice to use extensive amounts of long shots and keep his camera still allows for the imagery shown to sink in with the audience and give his images greater impact.

She makes the era come to life, from props to makeup, hair to costumes. Watch both films and you see what an amazing job she accomplishes. If you read Peter Biskind's great book Easy Riders, Raging Bulls you'll see that it is not a coincidence that Bogdanovich's work suffered after their divorce.\nThe narrative to the film is funny and sweet.

She must have a bladder the size of a peanut.\u00a0\n\nA favorite of mine will always be this nice, little road movie, Paper Moon. It was a movie that I sat down and watched years ago at a young age and I really didn't expect much from it. After 10 minutes on the road with Addie and Moze, I was having more fun than I could have thought possible. I've seen it several times since and it always leaves a lasting impression on me. It's one of those movies that you just have to watch once in awhile. It makes me feel a variety of feelings.\u00a0\n\nA con man named Moses attends the funeral of a one time \"friend\" and is asked to escort the dead woman's daughter, Addie, to Missouri. He reluctantly accepts and we soon learn it was just to make a quick buck off of her. When Addie finds out, she demands her money. So they begin to pull little con jobs together as they make their way to Missouri. Along the way, we see their relationship grow and there's always a sense of wonderment about whether Moze is Addie's biological father. I mean, they do have the same jaw.\n\nWhat makes this movie is the amazing father-daughter duo of Ryan O'Neal and Tatum O'Neal. Ryan is extremely good as the con man, but Tatum ends up taking over the show. Her performance as Addie is funny and emotional. Tatum didn't just impersonate being an actress as many child actors and actresses will do; she was one. I am under the firm belief that her performance in this film is the best performance from a child actress, or actor for that matter, ever. I'm also under the firm belief that that will never, ever change. You can hear all the praise about her performance and you can know that she won an Oscar, but until you see her onscreen; you couldn't believe it could be as amazing as it is.\n\nIf you want a fun movie, a depression era movie, a road movie, a father-daughter movie, or a grifter movie; watch Paper Moon immediately. It's an under-praised, under-seen, totally under-rated classic film, that entirely too few people know about. This is easily Peter Bogdanovich's best work I've seen. Give it a chance and I can say with pretty sting conviction that won't regret it.\u00a0",

This movie had a wonderful, easygoing charm to it - it's the sort of movie that, were more people to see it, would often be cited as a favorite. First and foremost, it's just a lovely story. In 1930s Great-Depression-stricken Kansas, a con-man meets and essentially adopts a recently orphaned little girl, who turns out to be much more clever than he is. It's the best kind of sentimental, without being unrealistic or maudlin. Ryan O'Neal is excellent as the con man, who seems like an earnest and likable guy for someone who makes a living swindling people. But the real star is his daughter Tatum O'Neal, who made history with this movie by becoming the youngest performer ever to win an Oscar (she won Best Supporting Actress for a performance she gave at the age of 8). Boy, is her performance something to behold. She's a street-smart little tomboy who can figure adults out quite well. She has perfect comic timing, and is just so lovable. By the end of the movie you're completely won over and really care for these characters. There's also a delightful supporting performance by the incomparable Madeline Kahn, playing a character named Trixie Delight (I'll let you figure out what that character's like). The black-and-white cinematography, excellent period sets and costumes, and wide-open Kansas spaces give the movie an excellent sense of setting. Peter Bogdanovich's direction is excellent, in the non-showy way of the older classic Hollywood directors he knew and still likes to talk about. This is one movie I feel like I could watch many more times in my life.",

There were so many times that this could have turned down the road and became a kid's movie, but it seems to always stay mature.  And Bogdanovich does an excellent job of creating a connection between Moze and Addie, and both characters with the audience.  I cared about them the entire time.  The movie opens up beautifully with a shot on Addie at her mother's funeral.  She is not crying, and it doesn't seem like she's trying to be anything, she's just herself.  Addie is an adult, she smokes, she curses, she can even get more money out of people than Moze.  She pretty much controls Moze.  But there's one difference: she has more heart than Moze.  This is what makes her better.  She will not steal from a widowed mother of five kids, but she will take from a widowed rich woman.  She never even stops setting her sights on money.  She gets aggravated when Moze wants to go on vacation with the woman.  But again, Addie gets her way.  Bogdanovich makes some scenes have long shots for something with a kid.  It always amazes me when directors can pull this off, just like what Bergman did with The Silence.  It was even great to see the small part that Randy Quaid had in the movie.  \"I'll rastle you for it!\"  I'm so excited to start a class by such a brilliant director.",

The child of course is Tatum O'Neal and she is an absolute delight. She is a breath of fresh air and does a superb job as Addie. Other cast such as her father Ryan O'Neal also do a good job and it all goes along very nicely. Shot in black and white, it gives a sense of the era itself and is beautifully shot. A classic film which everyone should watch at least once.",

IT's depression era, so travel takes some time. This gives the two some time to really resent the shit out of each other. You get the feeling that Tatum took the part so well because she'd already spent a lifetime annoying the shit out of her father.\r\n\r\nThe salesman, like all salesmen, is simply a sheister. His name's \"Moses Pray\" for God's sake. And while he clearly slept with the girl's ma, you get the feeling like her mom \"knew\" a lot of fellas, so the jury's out on paternity. But they take their trip and he teaches her the ways of the road. One of the best scenes is Addie's first scam. The accomplishment in her smile is worth the price of admission.\r\n\r\nThis goes on throughtout the film. Different scams and situations, including a quick relationship with a \"lady\" which also showed some great manipulative tactics by Tatum. But the scenes aside, which are all well written and acted. The main point is the relationship between Addie and Moses. It grows so organically and even in a fight between the two very naturally turns from a \"when are you leaving\" moment to a \"let's plan our next scam route\". It's done through their mutual aggravation and pride.",

Before his success came crashing down around him, he made a sweet and offbeat little comedy-drama, with an engaging and brilliant performance from a real father and daughter team. Set in 1935 in the American Midwest, it has recently orphaned Addie Loggins (Tatum O'Neal), who finds herself hitching a ride with travelling bible salesman Moses Pray (Ryan O'Neal), who may or may not be the father of Addie, as he seemed to know her mother. He offers to take Addie to her Auntie in Kansas, and it turns out on the way that Moses is a conman, conning recently bereaved people into buying bibles. Addie wants a piece of the action, and wants to join in with Moses with his way of confidence trickery. They make a good partnership. It's a sparse yet warm little film, rather like a fusion between two other films of 1973, The Sting and Badlands. It's offbeat tone feels like something out of a Coen Brothers film, but Bogdanovich gets the best from his actors. Tatum O'Neal is wonderful, she won an Oscar for this. Her father puts in a great turn, (always an underrated actor.) Well worth a look.",

Previously I recommended \u8292\u8059\u8079The Sting\u8292\u8059\u807a and \u8292\u8059\u8079The Brothers Bloom.\u8292\u8059\u807a Well, I discovered another great film that falls into this select category. This past weekend I found a film that transcends the genre, yet it keeps the same characteristics of the others. Wit. Charm. Theft. Deception. Relationships. The same words I have used for the previous films, I now tag onto this 1973 Oscar winning film: \u8292\u8059\u8079Paper Moon.\u8292\u8059\u807a\n\n\u8292\u8059\u8079Paper Moon\u8292\u8059\u807a is a little known film to this collegiate generation. I had never heard of it before hearing interviews and reviews for \u8292\u8059\u8079The Brothers Bloom,\u8292\u8059\u807a but when asking adults about it, they had all heard of it and even seen it in theaters. I wish I could go back and see this film in theaters for the joy of classic cinema.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, a con man, Moses Pray, picks up an orphaned girl, Addie Loggins, with the intention of taking her home to Missouri. Addie witnesses Moses\u8292\u8059\u8076 con scheme of selling personalized bibles to widows in Midwestern towns, and she joins him for the great con road trip of her life. Along the way they forge an unlikely father-daughter relationship and meet hilarious supporting characters.\n\nThe main actors are real life father-daughter team Ryan and Tatum O\u8292\u8059\u8076Neal, and that relationship drives this film. \u8292\u8059\u8079Paper Moon\u8292\u8059\u807a isn\u8292\u8059\u8076t a con film at heart. The story is about these two characters: one who is a smart aleck brat of a girl, the other a self-centered scam of a man. They never seem to completely get along, but that\u8292\u8059\u8076s not the point. It\u8292\u8059\u8076s about them learning to live with each other and subtly accepting that they work well together to extort hundreds of dollars from ailing widows.\n\nThe acting is incredible in \u8292\u8059\u8079Paper Moon.\u8292\u8059\u807a Tatum O\u8292\u8059\u8076Neal became the youngest actor or actress to ever win a competition Oscar for her supporting role as Addie. Ryan O\u8292\u8059\u8076Neal is equally as stubborn and witty in his role, and has some of the funniest bits I have seen on screen. He also teaches many lessons on how to con everyday people.\n\nOne other actor who does a great job in a two-bit part is Randy Quaid. He plays a farm boy who Moses wrestles for a car. It is a small role, but I was surprised to see an actor who I recognized from the \u8292\u8059\u8079Vacation\u8292\u8059\u807a movies in this classic gem.\n\nFilms aren\u8292\u8059\u8076t made like this one anymore as well. The most impressive thing I saw within \u8292\u8059\u8079Paper Moon\u8292\u8059\u807a was single shots that lasted a whole scene. The turning point of the first act (the time in which the characters can no longer return to who they were when the film began, also the time in which an incident launches them on the adventure) occurs with an argument on a long car ride. The shot lasts at least five minutes and it is one continuous take. This single shot apparently took more than 30 takes to get right during filming because little Tatum couldn\u8292\u8059\u8076t remember all of her lines. It is this scene though that probably garnered her the Oscar because it demonstrates how talented she was, rather than relying on fancy camera moves or fast cuts.\n\nYou always have to respect the classics, and even though this is black and white, it is character driven with sharp dialogue that resonates to this day. If that doesn't seem inviting, always email me for any recommendations or search out a film that you have been meaning to view. Until next weeks exciting entry, get busy livin\u8292\u8059\u8076 or get busy dyin\u8292\u8059\u8076.",

Along the way Moses discovers that his 9-year-old travel companion is a better con-artist than he is. The two are more alike than either would dare to admit and eventually they form an odd but profound friendship.\n\nI'm not sure if it was the comforting familiarity of working with her father or if it was just a character perfectly suited for her talents, but Tatum O'Neil knocks my socks off every time I watch this movie. If ever a young actress deserved Oscar recognition, she's the one.  The kid is just spectacular (and the film isn't bad either!).",

Johnson, Randy Quaid.\n \nIt's 1936 and nine year old Addie Loggins (Tatum O'Neal) is left orphaned. A traveling Bible salesman/con artist named Moses Pray (Ryan O'Neal) agrees to drive young Addie to her aunt's home in Missouri. Moses may or may not be Addie's real father. En Route, Moses discovers that Addie is quite a handful. She smokes, cusses and is as manipulative as he is. Soon Addie joins Moses in his scams as they travel the midwest. \n \nBeautifully shot in black and white, [i]Paper Moon [/i]definitely is an ode to a bygone era.  Ryan and Tatum O'Neal, real life father and daughter, have wonderful chemistry in the film.  Tatum O'Neal is especially impressive considering this was her first role and especially since Bogdanovich uses some very long takes in the film.  She became the youngest actor to ever win an Academy award.  Obviously the use of black and white enhances the period detail and mood of the film.  The influence of classic directors from the 40's & 50's is also evident in the film.  [i]Paper Moon[/i], along with the masterful [i]Last Picture Show[/i] shot two years earlier, seemed to suggest Bogdanovich was poised to join a new wave of great directors, but unfortunately that never happened.  Has he reached the heights of some of his peers, [i]Paper Moon [/i]would probably be looked at quite differently now.  Still I think it's worth checking out.  \n \n \n[left][b]The Sting (1973) - 8.4/10[/b][/left]\n[left]Director - George Roy Hill[/left]\n[left]Starring - Robert Redford, Paul Newman, Robert Shaw, Charles Durning, Eileen Brennan, Ray Walston, Harold Gould, Robert Earl Jones.[/left]\n\n[left]Robert Redford stars as small time grifter Johnny Hooker. After an apparently successful street con with partner and mentor Luther (Robert Earl Jones), Hooker learns that the money that was stolen actually belongs to crime boss Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw). After Luther is murdered, Hooker vows revenge, partnering up with notorious con artist Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman) who was a mutual friend of Luther. Gondorff & Hooker assemble a team of con artists to try and scheme Lonnegan out of a fortune before Lonnegan, or the police, find out.[/left]\n[left] [/left]\n\n[left][i]The Sting [/i]was an immensely popular film that didn't sacrifice it's artistic integrity to achieve it's popularity. It starts with an extremely witty and well-written screenplay by David S. Ward. Then re-teaming director George Roy Hill with actors Robert Redford and Paul Newman, who were responsible for the critically acclaimed and also immensely popular Butch Cassidy and the [i]Sundance Kid[/i]. Throw in some excellent character actors, a highly enjoyable score, and some nice camera work and you can't miss. And the film definitely did not. Redford and Newman play off each other so well, and George Roy Hill does an excellent job of pacing the film. Over 2 hours, but it zips along. [i]The Sting[/i] also contains one of the most memorable endings I have seen. Although I don't consider this to be a masterpiece, as pure enertainment it's hard to beat. No wonder it won the Oscar for Best Picture. [/left]",

But it wouldn't be make-believe; if you believed in me...\"[/i] - So proceeds the third verse of Ella Fitzgerald's 1938 song '[b]It's Only a Paper Moon[/b]' upon which Peter Bogdanovich based his 1973 film. A comedy of sorts, '[b]Paper Moon[/b]' is set during the great depression in the state of Kansas. It follows the exploits of broken con man Moses Pray (Ryan O'Neal) and his new found sidekick Addie Loggins (Tatum O'Neal). This father/daughter combination plays the central relationship as each character finds solace in one another's company, not to mention a brand new partner-in-crime. Initially the ironically titled Moses sees young Addie as a quick buck waiting to be made. But soon enough he realises that the youngster won't be such a pushover, bargaining with her for the cash he owes and soon enough they become quite the duo. Eventually 'Moze' and Addie allow their greed to catch up with them, spying a bootlegger for the taking and jumping at the opportunity. This inevitably leads to a run in with the local law and resultant loss of all they have gained in their weeks of swindling. So the journey comes to an end somewhat sadly, until in true Hollywood fashion things end happily after all.\n        \n            [img]http://i290.photobucket.com/albums/ll279/JediMoonShyne7/tejae.jpg[/img]\n            \n    Director Bogdanovich does well to create such authentic surroundings for his characters, and uses black and white to further enhance this feeling of age. Despite a lack of experience at the time he also manages to adapt the Joe David Brown novel '[b]Addie Pray[/b]' (upon which the film is based) with a certain confidence and assuredness. His excellent use of space impresses in particular, allowing cinematographer L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs what could be perhaps his finest hour in neatly portraying the rolling hills of Kansas. There is also a certain amount of theater to be seen within the central relationship, one that smacks of comedy as the straight-faced Addie proceeds to unleash her own sharp tongue upon a bumbling Moze whenever the opportunity arises. However stubborn the child is she comes to look up to her partner as a father-figure, learning his ways better than he himself. '[b]Paper Moon[/b]' is a fun, light-hearted saunter through life in the confidence game, complete with cartoonic characters and a dastardly duo that while entertaining an audience do little to encourage any depth in the plot. Indeed I feel mean to even think it but the fresh-faced Tatum O'Neal didn't merit a [i]best-supporting[/i] Oscar here, however pleasant her performance was to witness.\n            \n            [b]7/10 [img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/statusicon/forum_new.gif[/img][/b]",

Still, it is a pretty great film that delights with its humor and offers just enough heavy drama to keep us invested in the unfolding plot. Tatum's performance is inarguably one of the all-time finest by a child actor, but Madeline Kahn's saucy turn as a ditzy, gold-digging stripper steals the movie. What a naturally gifted comic actress that lady was. The way she delivers that vulgar bit of dialogue as she is trying to persuade Tatum's character to get back in the car caused me to laugh-out-loud, even now just thinking back on it. These are sad characters that feel so relatable in spite of their immoral schemes, as each of them chases their respective dreams of prosperity in Depression-era America. Bogdanovich's decision to film the movie in black-and-white enhances the old-time feel of earlier road pictures. For their efforts, the cast and crew got it right and have left us a pleasant little gem of a movie.",

            "content": "[b]Shame[/b] was downright action packed compared to the last couple of Bergman (\"Saraband\") films I've watched. Max Von Sydow (\"Rush Hour 3\") and Liv Ullmann (\"Saraband\") are a very unhappily married couple whose house seems to be in the middle of a war zone. Neither half of the couple are very cool. They both do some pretty despicable things. This wasn't my favorite of his films.\n\n[b]I am Legend [/b]pretty much rocked. Set in the future where a virus has wiped out much of the human race, leaving behind scary vampire/zombie like creatures, Will Smith (\"The Pursuit of Happyness\") has been living alone for three years in NYC. The first part of the film really takes its time establishing Smith's lifestyle and complete loneliness. Then it gets tense. My only real complaint is that the monsters were way too fake. When are people going to learn that CG will never be as cool as makeup?\n\nMichel Gondry (\"Be Kind Rewind\")'s [b]The Science of Sleep[/b] is both glorious and frustrating. Gael Garcia Bernal (\"El Pasado\")stars as a daydreaming artist who has trouble separating dream from reality. He falls for his neighbor and then it's a while will they/won't they thing. I loved the imagery, especially when Bernal is running the office in his dreams. But, after awhile, I just wanted to shake everyone in the story and tell them to get a grip.\n\n[b]Paper Moon[/b] was really, really good. Ten-year-old Tatum O'Neal (\"My Brother\") deserved her Oscar for playing an orphaned child who gives a con man what for. They hit the road together, he's supposed to be delivering her to some relatives, but then it turns out that she has quite a gift for the con. And is often smarter than her mentor. Hilarious and moving. One of my new favorites.\n\nWhat to say about [b]Southland Tales[/b]? I enjoyed the spectacle. Writer/director Richard Kelly's follow up to Donnie Darko is a bit like a Spanish soap opera. I have no idea what's happening, but I find it fascinating to watch. The plot is way too complex, but still interesting. The acting is strange, especially all the SNL people and Sarah Michelle Gellar (\"Suburban Girl\"), but not necessarily bad. I think it's just too much. It's sci-fi, but Kelly's obviously trying to make a political statement, in a very heavy-handed way. I guess I think if he was going to go this far, he should have just gotten even crazier.",

It's nostalgic, but not in a cloying, Sunday afternoon, My Dog Skip kind of way. I like that it tells a very small story with an enormous backdrop (a modern attempt would do the dull opposite).
