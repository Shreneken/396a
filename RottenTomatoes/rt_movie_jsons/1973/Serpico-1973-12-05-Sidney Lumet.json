    "summary": "Frank Serpico (Al Pacino) is an idealistic New York City cop who refuses to take bribes, unlike the rest of the force. His actions get Frank shunned by the other officers, and often placed in dangerous situations by his partners. When his superiors ignore Frank's accusations of corruption, he decides to go public with the allegations. Although this causes the Knapp Commission to investigate his claims, Frank has also placed a target on himself. The film is based on a true story.",

He's quite a quirky character, somewhat outspoken and dramatic at times but not always. There are some lower key scenes but that helps to build the overall picture I guess - it's not a constant action film, though certainly some scenes are somewhat reminiscent of the 'Dirty Harry' films, so I thought. A decent film, I'd recommend this, yes.",

The guy knew how to do drama; from the use of tone and building tension, to when and how to break up that tension with quieter, more subtle moments that both recreates the ebb and flow of real daily life and allows for the building of relationships and character development.\nSerpico is a great character. This is a man who truly stands out among the generic meatheads and your typical conservative cop. There is no by-the-book appearance or standard interests with this guy. Reading about (and seeing) ballet, listening to opera, dressing in village attire; all this and more make up a man who also is defiantly unbudging in his insistence of being a 'clean cop' in a city rampant with dirty ones. \nI liked both actors who played his love interests in the film, Sharpe and Eda-Young. Roberts give his usual good performance. We also see some long time character actors like John Randolph, Biff McGwire, Allan Rich, and even a came by the great M. Emmett Walsh.\nThe film did drag at times with me. I felt there were a couple of scenes that were redundant as the point was made already about the pervasiveness of the corruption as well as how extremely difficult it would be to prove. But it's a solid fact-based drama about a man of unquestionable integrity, courage, and unique personality who would not be moved. 3.8 stars",

In all seriousness, while this was a well made film with a story definitely worth telling, but it sadly never felt as interesting from a narrative standpoint in 2022 as I would suspect it did in 1973.\n\nI really dig Sidney Lumet's style from what I have seen so far and in Serpico he creates a grimy, raw, and stripped back feel that works perfectly in a film portraying the seedier aspects of 1970s NYC.\n\nAl Pacino plays the titular role so intensely, bringing a level of manic energy that was definitely able to create some anxiety in me too. I would have actually liked to have seen more of Frank Serpico before and after the events of this film and even after spending over two hours with him, still felt like he was somewhat underdeveloped. 7.5/10\n\nNYT 1000: #264",

            "content": "NYPD Officer Frank Serpico graduates from the police academy, and he becomes frustrated with his fellow officers' laxness. On patrol, he confronts three men raping a woman and apprehends one of the assailants. When the suspect is beaten during interrogation, Serpico declines to participate. He later persuades the suspect to give up the others. Serpico breaks protocol to arrest the suspect himself, but is coerced not to take credit. He is then assigned to the Bureau of Criminal Investigation. He moves to Greenwich Village and begins dating Leslie, a woman in his Spanish class. For his appearance, interests and a misunderstanding in the men's bathroom, he is accused of being homosexual. Serpico clarifies the situation to Captain McLain, and he requests a transfer. At his new precinct, Serpico works in plain clothes. While chasing a burglar, he is nearly shot when other officers fail to recognize him. Serpico later befriends Bob Blair, who has been assigned to the Mayor's Office of Investigations. Meanwhile, Leslie leaves Serpico to marry another man in Texas. Serpico is offered a bribe and informs Blair, who arranges a meeting with a high-ranking investigator. He is told that he must either testify or \"forget it\". He turns the bribe over to his sergeant. Serpico then requests a transfer, and begins recording his phone calls. At the time, he begins a romance with his neighbor, Laurie. He is reassigned to the 7th Division, but he immediately discovers corruption. Forced to accompany fellow plainclothes officers as they perpetrate violence, extortion, and collect payoffs, he refuses to accept his share of the money. He informs McLain, who assures him that the police commissioner wants him to continue gathering evidence, and that he will be contacted by the chief's office. Serpico becomes impatient waiting for the promised contact, fearing for his life. Serpico and Blair go to the mayor's assistant, who promises a real investigation and support. Their efforts are stymied by political pressure, and Serpico dismisses Blair's suggestion to go to other officials or the press...\n\nThe New York Times felt that the film was \"galvanizing\" for Pacino's performance, and by the \"tremendous intensity\" of Lumet's direction. The publication considered the film at the same time \"disquieting\" for its use of fictional names, as the reviewer felt that it diminished the role of Durk. Meanwhile, it called Theodorakis' soundtrack \"redundant and dumb\". The New York Daily News delivered a favorable review of the film. It rated it four stars out of five, and called it \"a triumph of intelligence, compassion and style\". A follow-up critic by the publication deemed Pacino's acting a \"masterful performance\", as the reviewer remarked \"he walks like a cop. He talks like a cop. He even seems to think as a cop\". The review also praised Lumet and his \"talent for achieving social realism\". The Record considered it \"one of the finest films of the year\". While it felt that the portrayal of Serpico was \"too righteous and obsessive\", the review favored Pacino, but felt that his performance was \"sometimes a little too intense\". It praised the photography of New York City as authentic, and credited Ornitz and Allen's work for it. The Village Voice wrote a mixed review. It criticized the focus of the film on Serpico, and the minor role the screenplay writers gave to the character that represented Durk. The reviewer considered that Serpico was \"worth seeing\" for Pacino's performance. Variety deemed Pacino's acting \"outstanding\", and Lumet's a combination of \"gritty action and thought-provoking comment\". For Newhouse News Services it was an \"exciting movie\", but the review remarked that it was \"weakened\" by its focus on Serpico. The news agency attributed the minimization of the other characters to avoid \"possible lawsuits\". The Los Angeles Times acclaimed Serpico. Charles Champlin called Pacino \"one of the handful of genuine star actors in American films\". Salt and Wexler's screenplay was hailed as \"almost documentary reality\", and its treatment of the main character \"a complex and evolving portrait\". The reviewer also remarked that the romances and break-ups were presented with \"unhackneyed honesty\". The contributions of the supporting cast were well noted. Champlin felt that Allen's work was considered to be \"high on the list\" for an Academy Award nomination and deemed Theodorakis' music \"effective\"\n\nGreat performance from Al Pacino in this Sydney Lumet film based on a true story with the focus on police corruption in the NYPD. It\u00b4s a gritty and a not too beautiful look upon the NYPD in the early 70s. I personally think that Al Pacino\u00b4s role interpretation of the character overshadows the rest of the film and with the slowpaced storyline that creates an unbalance in the film. The backdrop of New York in the 70s is however a great framing for \"Serpico\". Upon its release, Serpico became a critical and commercial success. At the same time, the film drew criticism from police officers. It received nominations for the Academy Awards and BAFTA Awards. Pacino earned the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama, while Salt and Wexler received the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.",

Serpico mightn't be the grand film about corrupt policemen but it's a tense couple of hours and Lumet ensures there's no shortage of character development.

Upon joining the force, Serpico is almost immediately exposed to free lunches, a partner ignoring a rape call, and the severe beating of a suspect.  Once the corruption is established, however, the film slips into a nice groove and is propelled by yet another electric performance from Pacino.

            "content": "Serpico is in the same vein of Touch of Evil or The French Connection.\n\nSidney Lumet's crime drama Serpico (1973) is a profoundly relevant film about real life police officer Frank Serpico's crusade to end police corruption and systematic bribery by the disgustingly lazy NYPD. Serpico is a hero to truth, justice, and decency, who fought for us all and he got nothing for it. Police are still taking bribes, breaking the law, covering up each other's corruption, and silencing any brave officers willing to speak out to the public and proper authorities. \n\nFurthermore, the vile police forces in America work for themselves to protect themselves and line their own pockets and Lumet's visionary direction demonstrates exactly how the police commit these heinous crimes and get away with them with help from every department of law enforcement in every city. Lumet goes full neo-noir where death is around every corner and hateful eyes pry into Serpico's work everyday. Serpico is a must watch cop drama that feels more important than ever with the police roaming the streets to silence and brutalize protestors of their illegal police brutality.\n\nPeter Maas' incredible novel details how Serpico conducted his investigation into police corruption in New York from within the NYPD's departments at great risk to his own life, career, and reputation. Waldo Salt and Norman Wexler's script bring his struggle to life with sympathetic perspective and realistic dialogue that vents his frustrations and fears in gripping honesty. Serpico is so sincere in its viewpoint that you cannot help but root for this lone courageous voice wielding nothing but badge.\n\nDede Allen's editing is slick with hard cuts in and around Serpico's life for a riveting and engaging 130 minute epic of investigative detective work. Arthur J. Ornitz' cinematography has classic 1970's wide shots of New York's garbage riddled streets, but it's his striking close-ups that hit the hardest in Serpico. Mikis Theodorakis' score is full of beautiful Italian and Greek themes that enshroud Serpico in a protective grace to cover all the ugly crimes committed by cops and lowlifes around him. Anna Hill Johnstone's clever costumes are the secondary star of Serpico as Al Pacino has a new getup in every scene. It's fun watching Pacino dress up as a hippie or a rabbi.\n\nAl Pacino is the real draw here as the fiery and persistent Officer Frank Serpico. Pacino portrays him as just and steadfast with an understandable temper at the frustrating lack of help or cooperation from local authorities. Pacino depicts a hero cop just trying to do the right thing in a wrong system. Everyone protects the bad cops instead of turning them in because all cops are bad. Pacino demonstrates how Serpico is the lone dissenter to endless slews of police corruption.\n\nI like the supporting cast in Serpico too. There is a wonderful bounty of excellent supporting actors and actresses. Biff McGuire is great as the Captain Inspector McClain who is hellbent on slowing down Serpico's investigation through the guise of an ally. M. Emmet Walsh cameos as the corrupt city official Gallagher. F. Murray Abraham cameos as Detective Partner that allows Serpico to go in alone during a drug raid in a chilling sequence.\n\nIn short, Serpico is one of those landmark pictures of total directorial control from Sidney Lumet with a compelling character of Frank Serpico and a commanding lead actor in Al Pacino.",

            "content": "It is so inspiring to see a film about a police officer who fights against the corruption in the system without getting his own hands dirty. I\u2019ve seen films and TV shows about undercover officers who want to bring down the bad cops, but they always have to become one to make that happen. Invariably this makes the character less likable to me, and inevitably part of the plot revolves around them sinking too far and being tempted by the money or drugs that come with being dirty. Then along comes Frank Serpico who puts his life on the line every single day because he makes it clear that he won\u2019t play their game. It makes for an amazing underdog story, as it seems virtually every cop is against him, and spends their time trying to invent ways to get him fired or killed. When I saw in the closing credits that this was based on a real man, I instantly wanted to know more because I loved the character of Serpico so much. While others relish watching more films about gangsters, I can\u2019t get enough of the stories about the \u201cboy scouts\u201d who want to bring down a crooked system. This might be my favorite performance from Al Pacino, because he has that toughness that this man needed in order to survive, but added something more to it. He plays those moments when people are asking him to break the law with the perfect indignant looks. He makes it clear that, not only is he not going to do it, but he can\u2019t even comprehend why someone would think of doing such a thing. All of the supporting cast is brilliant, and it was fun spotting all the familiar faces of these dedicated character actors who would continue to pop up in movies for years to come. If there was any one aspect of Serpico that didn\u2019t work for me it would be the romantic relationship stuff. I understand that this is useful for building up the main character, and it\u2019s also the only way they were able to get some females into this film, but it didn\u2019t add enough to the story for me. Aside from giving Frank someone to vent to without threat of retaliation, it was a handful of unnecessary scenes. But that was such a small complaint in what was otherwise an amazing film. I\u2019m a sucker for any David & Goliath story, and Serpico\u2019s story is so engaging that I want to research it further (and watch this movie again.)",

Al Pacino gives one of his best performances as Frank Serpico, an NYPD cop who tries to be honest in a corrupt system, despite his own eccentric behavior that makes him stick out.  He does an excellent job showing Serpico had his own problems, from womanizer to refusing to take proper action in some cases when corruption appeared (more than once, he turns a blind eye to it).  Sydney Lumet gives some excellent direction, with his gritty style perfect for this true story.  The one downside is the film doesn't emphasize the number of cops that were on Serpico's side and how some of his superiors did back him (it's telling many characters had their name changed so the movie studio to avoid lawsuits).  Nevertheless, this is still an solid true crime drama on how corruption erupts in police departments, not so much from the corrupt cops themselves but the superior officers who turn a blind eye.

Al Pacino did a really good job portraying Frank Serpico, even the story is faithful to the original material. I would say more about Serpico but I just can't because there's really nothing more to talk about it. It's a brilliant good old biographical crime film.",

It's cool to see how he's unraveling how the police department actually works.

Good humor and a good amount of New York wit. \n\nThis movie rolls along so smoothly, that it's extremely easy to watch. That's supreme writing right there. I'm really digging Al Pacino's style in this movie, it's groovy. It must be hard trying to do good and be a humane person when your surrounded by schmucks and people who play dirty and do things for money, but Serpico, that's another story. He's got his head on right. It's pretty insane to see the situation he puts himself in. \n\nIt's amazing how the use of different camera angles can define a certain scene.

In breaking the unwritten code of silence and complicity in their corrupt activities Serpico made himself a target, a figure of derision even outright hostility, one they would have preferred to quietly disappear.  \n\nIt ably makes the point that unaccountable authority corrupts absolutely, blurring the distinction between criminal and law enforcement, the so called good guys turning out to be equally rotten as those they're supposed to be investigating. Themes that still resonate today. Pacino gives one of his finest stand-out performances here and literally carries this film single-handed, quite an achievement. A certified classic of 70's cinema.",

The story centres around the life of Serpico from his time in the police department, in the B.C.I to his much larger and active involvement in the Seventh Division. It also focuses heavily on how affected he is by police corruption and the strain it puts on him and his relationship with his girlfriend. \nPacino delivers a splendid performance as always, and his portrayal of Serpico arouses a lot of questions as he is a unique and strange character, rarely seen in anything else. \nDespite an undoubtedly good performance from Pacino, 'Serpico' goes down the road of clich\u00e9s when there's hardly any interesting characters to approve of, due to an excessive lacking of character development. Most of the characters are just there to act hostile towards Serpico himself, whom is a very strange cop, who acts against police corruption and the assaulting of criminals within the department. I guess that's a decent way to put it (who would disagree?), but it becomes clich\u00e9d and boring, and the only real attention is the fine peformance of Pacino - and even the story becomes a bit confusing to follow, due to all of this, but it's a fact-based movie about 'A man's story within the New York Police Department.'

            "content": "With their second collaboration in 1974, Al Pacino and Sidney Lumet delivered one of the very best films of the decade with \"Dog Day Afternoon\". It was a taut and captivating true-life story of a bank robber that gets way in over his head. Two years previously, though, they worked on another true-life story from the opposite side of the law. This time it was NYPD officer Frank Serpico and how he got way in over his head with police corruption rife all around him.\n\n1960's New York: Frank Serpico is a cop who refuses to extort the local criminals and take pay-off's even though all his colleagues seem to be in on it. As a result, nobody trusts or wants to work him and Serpico begins to realise that his life is in danger by the very people who have sworn to protect and serve. Time and time again, he refuses to go on the take, hoping that an investigation will be launched into the conduct of his numerous partners but knows that it will take his own involvement or testimony to make a difference.\n\nAfter a frantic opening where Serpico is rushed to hospital bleeding from a gunshot wound to the face, Lumet slows events down and goes back to where it all began. We witness his recruitment to the police department and his ideological approach to the job. It's slow to start and spends a bit too much time on Sepico's home life when really all you want is for the police corruption angle to move along. That being said, when things do start to get going, the film improves as it progresses. \n\nRevered as one the finest films of the 70's and for it's time, that's completely understandable as police corruption drama's were not as commonplace as they are now. However, it now looks dated and time hasn't been all that kind to it. Arthur J. Ornitz's cinematography is observant enough to utilise the New York locations to excellent effect which lend the film a suitably grim and realistic tone but some scenes are far too dark to fully make out what's actually going on. For the most part, Lumet's handling of the material is strong and he's in no rush to relate this biopic. Although this is commendable, his pacing is slightly misjudged leaving you with feelings of lethargy and an overlong running time. Added to which - with the obvious exception of Serpico - there really isn't any other character that gets attention in Waldo Salt and Norman Wexler's screenplay. The support are all two-dimensional and some of the acting on show is very questionable, indeed. It even wastes the talents of great character actors like M. Emmett Walsh and F. Murray Abraham in thankless bit-parts. The most glaring flaw, however, is Greek composer Mikis Theodakaris' ridiculously overused and misplaced music score. It's feels random, tonally different and bears heavily on particular scenes that it brings nothing of value to. It even plays over the dialogue which can be difficult to hear and results in the film feeling cheap.\n\nNow, this sounds like a lot of flaws for a film that's held in such high regard but they do happen to be there and wouldn't be looked upon kindly by a contemporary audience. That aside, though, there is still much to recommend the film. It builds tension with ease and has numerous standalone scenes that are of a very high quality and the denouement is, simply, a work of genius. \n\nUltimately, it's a vehicle for Pacino and, unsurprisingly, he delivers an explosive central performance. It's one of his most iconic and his commitment to the role actually raises the film beyond a particular standard. \"The Godfather\" may have been the film that made his name but it's his performance here that cemented it. He not only echoes the reservation of Michael Corleone but also displays moments of frustration and rage that allow him to grandstand in the way that only Al knows how.\n\nMuch like the refusal of Frank Serpico to go on the take, I refuse to fall into line with the particular posse of critics who see no fault in this film.\nI honestly thought I'd be handing out top marks for a film I was very fond of in the past but I wouldn't be being honest if I did. That's not to say that it doesn't have quality in there too, though. Age may not have been kind but you can't put a time on a top class performance.\n\nMark Walker",

Another Oscar nominated, passionate and all round fantastic leading man performance from one of my favourite actors of all time.\n\nSerpico begins with the film's protagonist being escorted to hospital with a gunshot wound to the face and as the police chiefs begin to discuss the ramifications of it being Serpico that was shot and not any other police officer, the audience begins to understand that Serpico isn't just the average cop. It was a brave decision to start the film on this note but it works brilliantly as the audience is aware for the whole film of where Serpico's actions are leading him towards and it makes for gripping viewing as even being at work places his life at risk from those whose motto is to protect and serve.\n\nThe film does look dated, the blood in the first few scenes leaves you in no date as to the film's age, but as a character study and crime drama, Serpico really is a great film that I now consider to be a classic.",

When he gets shot in the face with a small bullet and has his face disabled, Frank resigns from his job after being awarded the medal of honor and moves to Switzerland. The film has an old-fashioned, gritty documentary look while the story is told in a biopic crime drama.

This is a movie that deserves to be watched and not missed by any stretch. Serpico gets a 9.7/10.",

            "content": "Al Pacino is one of my favourite actors, yet it occurs to me I have seen him in few roles where he is not a villain, such as 88 Minutes, Sea of Love and his magnificent performance in Scent of a Woman. Mostly, he's about being a villain of various proportions from being a mafia boss in The Godfather to being a cartoonish thug in Dick Tracy. But the great thing about Serpico is that Al Pacino portrays a humane character, one who blends in with a crowd as a regular human being. And that may sound easy, but when you're as skilled a man at acting as Al Pacino with such a legacy, it's a difficult thing to achieve, yet he does it though one simple action. There is a scene where Frank Serpico is ordering a sandwich like an ordinary man, and he smiles. He doesn't smile because he knows he's manipulated someone, he smiles because he's happy merely about getting his lunch. Al Pacino transitions into playing a heroic role with gusto by acting humane, and it gets better at a particular scene later on where he moves into a new apartment and purchases a local puppy dog to help out some locals and we learn that he's a character who can make a connection easily. Al Pacino gives an excellent performance in Serpico, and makes it thoroughly compelling.\n\nSerpico is a powerful crime drama and strong biopic since it touches on the complicated and controversial topic of police corruption without resorting to characterising him as a maniacal action hero by having him portrayed on screen through dynamics in which Frank Serpico remains stoic yet threatening merely because of his lack of interest in bending the law for personal gain. It's his disdain for corruption that builds as the character develops through the progressing story which comes from his enemies feeling threatened, which displays a theme of fear from the antagonist at the protagonist in a complicated and conflicting story which is conveyed strongly and directed finely by Sidney Lumet in a collaboration with Al Pacino before the creation of the film deemed his masterpiece, Dog Day Afternoon. \nSerpico is also strongly scripted and features a well crafted musical score, so it's truly a great film despite being inconsistent in its pacing and not taking full advantage of its music to strengthen the atmosphere, as well as being uncertain in answering its questions at times due to the fact that Frank Serpico does not always have the answers. But it doesn't detract much from the fact that Serpico is a strong crime biopic about a real hero with an iconic look which Al Pacino matches well and gives a strong performance to.",

He's absolutely magnetic here and his Frank Serpico is such a well-written and likeable character that he easily carries the film.  Some negative reviews have focused on how he never feels like a fully realized cop in the movie, but I think that's kind of the point.  He feels like the odd man out.  He feels like the rookie who went out on his own.  He's the outsider and that's what makes him easy to root for.  Other reviews felt that the movie doesn't go far enough with its central theme, which I find fairly ridiculous (and I also think that time has already been the judge on that).  \"Serpico\" continues to be one of the foremost movies that gets into the psyche and price of what it means to be \"a good cop\" and it's no wonder that Pacino made his name on roles like this one.",

But it does show nearly every borough of New York City, in all their grimness, but it has a brilliant lead performance. In 1960, Frank Serpico (Al Pacino) joins the New York Police Department, and he showing tenacity as a uniformed policeman on the street, he's promoted being a plainclothes policeman, and it's here that he discovers the dark side of undercover police work, and he see's first hand police corruption going on around the city. From excessive violence being used, to police officers taking drugs and accepting cash bribes. After 10 years on the force, Serpico decides that enough is enough, and that he's going to expose the corruption going on in the New York Police once and for all, but he's threatened by his peers and an attempt is made on his life as well. It's a very good and very gritty film, with Pacino putting in a brilliant lead performance, and his Serpico is a hero you can identify with. Lumet does well with a very small budget, and the result is one of the toughest and rawest films of the 1970's.",

It's from a different time and place but it brings you in to that perfectly and before long it's your world as much as it's Serpico's.\n\nThere is the niggling issue that this film just doesn't go far enough, the tension that is built up so superbly throughout just splashes away in the end as opposed to leaving a bruise but that could have compromised the sense of reality in this film so it's an understandable approach. \n\nCertainly a defining film in the cop-drama genre and a memorable biopic too.",

This film tells the real life story of Frank Serpico, an honest cop working in a corrupt environment. Brilliantly acted by Al Pacino, the lead character is a powerful tour de force performance that ranks among the actors greatest works. This is a brilliant film that delivers a great story, and you sympathize with the lead character because Al Pacino has so much screen presence that you simply cannot tear yourself away from the screen. Very well crafted, directed and paced, Serpico is yet another flawless masterwork by director Sidney Lumet who can always craft a thought provoking work of cinema. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, and I was mesmerized by Pacino who is absolutely terrific here. This was made during his peak years, and he was on a roll with making great films. This is a fine crime drama that should appeal to viewers of the genre, and if you love true life picture, then Serpico is definitely not a film to pass up on. Lumet's flair for what makes an effective story is apparent throughout, and he is able to get the most out of his actors because he always seems to have great stories to tell, and this is such an example of a film that needed to be told because true stories are simply compelling and engaging and Lumet definitely captures the feel and essence of its key elements. Frank Serpico's determination of uncovering the corruption in the NYPD is terrific and his inner conflict and subsequent struggle to do what's right is what keeps you hooked from start to finish. An unforgettable drama definitely worth your time.",

The fact is that criminals and \"ordinary\" people are more fascinating characters than cops since their theories are more interesting.

            "content": "Wait, a crime film directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Al Pacino as a guy named Frank? Is anyone else noticing that Al Pacino seems to really dig the name Frank? Seriously, I knew that it wasn't \"that\" kind of a romantic comedy (You get what I'm saying, fans of \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"?), but I was having a hard time figuring out whether Pacino was Frankie or Johnny (Johnny could be the girl's name, you never know how cruel someone's parents can be), yet with this film, there was only one lead, his name was Frank, and you better believe that it was the first of... well, only three Franks (I like to exaggerate when people do something more than once or twice) to be played by Pacino, because this film is nothing if it's not without aspects that you remember from other Pacino films, and certainly other Sidney Lumet films. Well, to be fair, this crime film is a little bit different from Lumet's usual work, because this time, it's about the cops... conducting criminal activity. Still, outside of this film, about the furthest Lumet went from the crime genre was \"The Wiz\", and even then, I can think of plenty of people who would consider \"The Wiz\" some kind of crime, and plus, it was the usual 130-something-minute runtime that Lumet seemed to loved hitting. I don't know how you make a Motwon twist on \"The Wizard of Oz\" over 130 minutes, but boy, did Lumet go for it, because he seemed to love a good challenge, and the 130-something-minute region on a film runtime clock seems to be one of those in-between regions that's hard to hit. I know that sounds weird, but hey, just look at this film, because it seemed to be having trouble making it between 120 and 140, for although it's quite the decent watch, it goes held back quite a bit by its needing some serious tightening.\r\n\r\nThe film has plenty of looseness, going padded out by overdrawn material or material that is simply expendable, with even rather large chunks of the film warranting complete omission. The film will hit the occasional subplot or simply a lengthy point of nothing that's really relevant to the central story, and segments like those slow plot down, sometimes even to a halt, as they have little, if any considerable value in the film and simply leave the final product to suffer from uneven focus. All of this excessive padding certainly exacerbates the film's fair bit of slowness. With the help of the aforementioned dragging, the film often finds itself falling limp, with quiet dryness or nothingness also really slowing, if not all-out dulling things down, perhaps even more, as the dryer spots in the film will even work their way into the more relatively tight and focused segments, and after a while, for a lengthy lapse of time within this film, you lose a bit of engagement value and investment. Sure, the larger chunks of the film that actually play up the central focus pull you back in, yet they still go kept from really hitting all that deep all that often, and not just because the film is otherwise quite messy, but because there are plenty of dramatic touches whose effectiveness goes diluted by a bit of manipulativeness that will sometimes descend as low as overwhelming sentimentality. The film has its high points, but for far too long, it is borderline aimless, yet quite decidedly consistent in its slowness, and by the time things really do pick up, the film has lost so much steam that the kick of the thrills go pulled back to the point of being rendered incapable of raising the final product past underwhelming. Still, make no mistake, this film has high points, and just enough for it to stand as generally worth your time, while certain consistent aspects keep you engaged throughout, or at least your eyes engaged.\r\n\r\nArthur J. Ornitz's isn't used to the fullest terribly often, and sometimes, things are just too blasted dark, yet regardless of these factors against the photography, the film is consistently rather handsome in an admittedly dated fashion, but one that still works a fair bit, both as something pretty to look at and as a supplement to the film's tone. Again, the film will get to be too blasted dark for its own good, but more often than not, when the photography turns dark, the film's tone turns dark with it and recieves an extra kick of effectiveness through the cinematography's grit, which really captures the harsh griminess of the situation, and certainly more than Waldo Salt's and Norman Wexler's actually kind of cruddy score does. Still, it's not just Ornitz's photography direction that gives the periodic grit some life, as it's Sidney Lumet general film direction that empowers this film's intrigue... as much as it cripples it. As I said, for most of the film, nothing happens and Sidney Lumet's limp storytelling doesn't help in the least, yet he does give the film a certain consistent charm to keep you going until the film comes to its higher moments, at which point, Lumet wakes up and delivers on engrossing intrigue, if not a bit of genuine tension at points, and it all comes down to dramatic depths that may go hurt Lumet's fairly intense manipulativeness, yet still pull through enough to give the film additional weight in order to make its final messages all the more provocative. Yes, the strengths of the film, like the whole final product itself, are consistently imperfect or even downright flawed, yet they do hit enough of their fair share of high points that ultimately make it worth the sit. However, there is an aspects that never faults, and that is, of course, Al Pacino's performance, which is thoroughly charismatic, as well as effortlessly faithful to the traits and characteristics of Frank Serpico, so much so that Pacino comes close to becoming lost in the role, yet not at the expense of his almost trademark charm. However, when things go down, Pacino is yet another supplement to the compellingness, as he really puts in a lot of subtle depth and layers, as well as intense emotion that gives us genuine insight into the honesty, anguish and overall being of our lead, thus solidifying Pacino as not simply a powerful lead, but one of, if not the greatest aspect to this film's ultimately emerging a watchable film, however flawed it may be.\r\n\r\nWhen it's all said and done, the film is rendered underwhelming by its consistent slowness that borders on, if not collapses into dull, a situation exacerbated by the excessive looseness of the film that leaves many a scene to drag and many a subplot or segment of nothingness to slow the momentum of the film until, after a while, it goes limp, yet not to where it's rendered dismissable, let alone medicore, keeping your eyes caught with Arthur J. Ornitz's imperfect, yet generally handsome and occasionally even resonance-supplementing cinematography, as well as Sidney Lumet's also imperfect, but consistently charming and, eventually, powerfully intriguing storytelling, with Al Pacino being unflinching in his thoroughly charismatic, layered, emotional and all around transformative performance as the honest cop who famously made a stand for proper justice, thus leaving \"Serpico\" to ultimately stand as a thoroughly watchable, periodically gripping and ultimately provocative drama, heavily flawed though, it may be.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",
