            "content": "So when this movie came I had requested my parents to let me watch it. And when I say request, I mean really, a lot. I had seen the prequel in the theatre and had been waiting for this movie to come out ever since. It got delayed by a year. At first I was mad because the Baahubali: The Beginning said 2016 in the end, and the year was already going too bad. But finally it came in 2017, so I guess that makes it better.\nAnd just like Baahubali: The Beginning, this one also felt legendary. Not like a cheap sequel the way successful movies make, but an actual conclusion we had all been hoping for. The question as to why Katappa killed Baahubali was answered in the most spectacular way possible. We finally got to see how Baahubali met Devasena and why he was banished from Mahishmati. The action scenes were even better than the previous movie, and it concluded without any sequel baiting.\nI see why there are so many negative reviews over here. This movie can only be truly enjoyed in a theatre. It won't have the same impact when being watched on a TV or phone. It needs a huge audience to cheer, a perfect environment to be absorbed and the satisfaction we get after we spend a good amount of money to watch a movie.\nI am really hoping this saga has come to an end. They should not make more movies unless it is really necessary. We already have the perfect duology and having more than what we need will only ruin its image which we obviously don't wish to see. This movie deserves the same love as we give to all our ancient scriptures, because that is the vision which SS Rajamouli had while making this, and it's very much apparent when we watch this movie.",

Baahubali 1 was a thrilling movie with somewhat an abrupt ending. But the second part tells us the best part of the story. The first half shows us the intense love story of Amarendra Baahubali and  Devasena while the second half is mostly on why kattappa killed Baahubali and the war. The climax war is something really amazing. All the scenes are well shot and is a visual treat. And the music makes it better.\n\nDon't judge the movie, go watch it. And if you haven't seen the first part or have forgotten, watch it and then go for the second.\n\nMany questions of yours maybe unanswered in the movie, if you're really interested, buy the RISE OF SIVAGAMI. For all huge fans, it's a must.\n\nOverall I would give it a 4/5",

The full year passed with the 'Why Katappa killed Baahubali' jokes. But when the film dazzled in the theatre, the whole theatre felt like the majestic palace of Mahishmathi and I, for myself, felt like a piece of the crown, witnessing the grandeur and the joyous spectacle on the screens. Prabhas originally lifts off the screens this time, with a more solid performance as, this time, Amarendra Baahubali in the major half of the film. The characters, already fleshed out, have become more exciting. And the story, more outstanding. This film is easily Rajamouli's victory of vision. Despite a low on logic war scene which made me sorely miss the first Baahubali movie, the film lives up to the originality of the sequel, even when it doesn't equalize. This is a surely unmissable film. Go watch. ",

This isn't a bad thing, as learning the backstory increases the dramatic weight of the action-packed finale. I do feel this movie is slightly better overall since it has more impressive visual effects and the story was more engaging overall. I do feel the movie has a bit of a rocky start but eventually picks up and stays at a good pace from that point forward. The action scenes are definitely very over the top, but they are entertaining. It's a solid follow up to this ultimately well told two-part story. I definitely think the time invested in watching both of them was worth it.",

In eega hero will be killed and \nhis soul will go to a fly and takes revenge.Here in baahubali the killed hero's son will take revenge.So the plot is same.\n                                                                                       The insertion of mahishimati kingdom and characters like sivagami,kattapa,Ballaladeva,pingaladeva and ofcourse our hero\nAmerandra baahubali and mahendra baahubali makes us not to think of the plot.Screenplay makes us not think about anything so fast. Graphics  from elephant to broken ballaladeva's statue was excellent .Flying boat and soliders flying in air with shield is just an example of rajamouli's innovations.\n                     Prabas,Rana,Ramya krishnan,nasser,sathyaraj were outstanding\nin their roles.Prabas was excellent in acting the emotions given by him when he killed was perfect.Sathyaraj and Ramya krishnan were SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS sathya raj's acting when he asked to kill baahu and when he stab baahu with tears was mind blowing and we shed tears and ramya krishnan's expression when anushka sending reply letter gives goosbumps.Anushka shetty as devasena was brilliant in acting.\nHer dialog delivery was perfect .Her emotions were very real that gives every audience goosebumps.The songs were very good especially kanna ne thungada was awesome.Choreography was nice in all songs \nextra marks for the boat song 'nana devasena'.\n                                                                                    When kattapa stab baahubali we will feel the pain.The whole theater is in silent(first day)\nEach and every person in the theater shed tears it is the real victory of \nBAAHUBALI 2",

The whole backdrop leading to the Baahubali killing is really silly as well as predictable.\nCinematography and background score is average.\nSo is there any impressive thing about this movie?? Yes, particularly two scenes ...\none is the oath taking scene which is visually delightful and surprisingly painstaking. \nSecondly the final climactic combat between the 2 bodybuilders which was pretty decent for an action cinema...\nAll the others stunts /special effects are good for only 5 minutes.\nPerformance which demand a lot of shouting is justified by Prabhas, Rana and Ramya.\nKattapa a bit overacting drama queen and his comedy is pathetic. But still He shines in some serious situations.  Anushka looks a bit old for a princess but still manages her role with a somewhat of a decent job. The directorial vision depends extremely on deficient visual effects and sturdy characters which is a big letdown.\nOverall a nice attempt by the filmmakers to explore a historic theme but they really should pay much more attention to script writing, laws of physics, logic and many more....",

The special effects weren't the best, but it never hurt my enjoyment of it, and it's amazing how much this movie can do with such a low budget compared to an American blockbuster.

The righteous woman, who was a confident, fiery, composed and a far sighted commander in movie 1 seemed baffled, aggressive, stubborn, egotist and gullible in the latter one.\nThe first half was a little stretched and the second half defied physics on all grounds. Poor Tamanaah had next to no role, i wished to see her in the action sequences, the village lady who baahubali had saved in first part had more role than Tamanaah a.k.a. Avantika.\nAll the actors however did justice to their role, be it the antagonist Rana, who made presence felt with just his expressions and body language, the Tigress Ramya krishnan, the Stalwart Sathyaraj, the Majestic Prabhas and ofcourse, the Doyenne Anushka Shetty. \nThe technical team did wonders to the film, hats off to the tech team. The story bridged the two parts nicely.\nAll in all, it's a must watch family movie. :)",

A halfling from the shire is tasked with protecting the fate of the free world. Why not? And if there ever was a work of Fantasy that taxed your ability to say \"why not?\" it was this one.\n\nBaahubali 2 is a triumph of CGI over a good story. A victory of extravagance over character development. Having said that, it's not without it's merits. If taken in the context of mythology/fantasy the movie will perhaps be one of the best movies of this year (both domestically and internationally). The acting is top notch, with Ramya, Sathyaraj and Rana leading the way.\n\nThe film contains all the opulence and exaggeration that is to be expected from a South Indian movie, unfortunately it also contains the naivety that is to be expected from a mythological story. The film in my opinion fails to take the age old concepts of power, manipulation and betrayal and give us something both new and grand (it certainly succeeded in the latter)\n\nBaahubali is the story of a man who was seen as a God, but the film certainly makes you wonder if he's even mortal. His only humane quality is perhaps his complete ignorance of the dangers that surround him. A quality of the strong? or the stupid? depends on your perspective. There is no doubt that the film is entertaining, however, my only wish was that the film should have balanced the fantastical with the natural rather than with the ludicrous.",

Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is here to answer the question the nation has been waiting to know for two long years- Kattappa ne Bahubali ko kyu mara? \n\nRelax- No spoilers here! You have to go, and watch the movie to find out, just like the rest of us did. \n\nBut when you go to watch Baahubali 2, remind yourself of few things-\n\n1. This is a sequel to Baahubali: The Beginning, so either re-watch that movie, or read the story on Wikipedia, to remind yourself of the story and characters. (If you have not seen that movie, go watch it first. Duh!) \n2. If you have seen Baahubali, you know what exactly to expect from this sequel. It is a Telugu movie (irrespective of which dubbed version you see), so the storytelling is inherently grandiosely  in nature.  So the hero's will have heroic scenes and dialogues, and the villains will have over-the-top background music with extreme close ups to show you the villainy in them. \n3. This is a $200 million ambition movie, made with the budget of not even $50 million. So the VFX will at times be with par with international cinema, and at times be extremely patchy. Forgive it for that.\n\n?So I ask you give in, and allow director S. S. Rajamouli to take you on this EPIC journey.?\n\nYes, the story is a bit been there seen that, but the screenplay is very cleverly written to still keep you entertained and hooked for good three hours. ?And that is a big win for the director and writer V Prasad. ?\n\n?The production and set design are huge, and beautiful (yes, some of it is CGI, but still a great combination). The action sequences are very well choreographed, and have been attempted at international movie level. The art design, and cinematography are breathtaking. The costumes, and make-up are on point. The soundtrack is soulful, and takes the story forward, instead of breaking the narrative. But better than the soundtrack is the background music. What fabulous work. Especially for the scene right before the interval. Outstanding stuff. ?\n\nActing wise, everyone in the ensemble cast has done a fabulous job. ?Ramya Krishnan as the ego-stricken mother, Sathyaraj as Kattappa the loyal protector looking for redemption, Nassar as the cunning father, and Rana Daggubati as the vengeful brother, have all delivered great performances. ?\n\nBut the two people who stand out tall in this movie are ?Prabhas ?plying the original Baahubali and ?Anushka Shetty? playing his love interest. If you liked Baahubali the son, you will love Baahubali the father. The son version was just a small shadow of what the father is. He is everything you expect a \"Hero\" to be. He has the swagger, flamboyance, and charisma, a \"Hero\" should have. As for ?Anushka?, she is the strong female character I wanted ?Tamannaah Bhatia ?to be in the first movie. Anushka is strong, and does not back down from her ideals and beliefs, no matter who is on the other side. That's kickass. Bollywood is gonna go ga-ga over these two. \n\nBut yes, the movie is not perfect. It has its flaws. There are some continuity faults that I caught. The narrative sometimes becomes a bit self indulgent and looses focus. The climax is not as epic as I expected it to be. And like I said above, the VFX is not perfect. Also, some of the extras insisted on hamming their scenes. But despite these flaws, Baahubali is a huge achievement. It's not just entertaining, it's also one of the most technically sound movie to come out of India. And just for that, you should go watch, enjoy, and support this magnanimously ambitious project.",

            "content": "If Indian cinema has a Hall of Fame, Baahubali 2 will be one of the all-time-greatest movies & will occupy the throne for a very long time to come. OMG, I have never watched a movie with so much awe for almost every scene. CGI, sets and reality have blended so well to create visual splendor at never seen before levels, that you forget yourself and become part of the movie. There is no more comparison with Hollywood for standards/quality of movie making. Indian cinema has truly ARRIVED at the world level, setting new standards for movie making.\n\nThat was about the experience of watching the movie and the quality of movie making itself. Coming to the story/script:\n\nFor me, \"Why Kattappa killed Baahubali\" was not a big question at all - knowing Kattappa's love for Baahubali & the fact that he was a slave to the throne, either Bhallala deva or Sivagami should have ordered him was obvious.\n\nBaahubali stands tall(not just physically), but also by the measure of his character. He makes some good choices when faced with a dilemma of blind obedience to throne/mother or Dharma(even though it meant he picked his wife/lover and not mother). It is sad that he never could sit on the throne in spite of being people's choice. Prabhas has become synonymous with Baahubali with his utterly flawless all-around performance. He does it all - mind boggling stunts, romance, dance, comedy and sentimental scenes. Looking like a King should have been so effortless for him - he wears it so naturally.\n\nIf there is one character that can surpass/equal Baahubali, it is the warrior Princess Devasena. Be it the fight sequences, stoic endurance of 25 years of torture, romance, dialogue delivery - Anushka is an actress par excellence. She comes across as the personification of majestic beauty, strength and fierce independence. Her screen presence is a force to reckon with.\nNo other actress could have matched Prabhas - if Prabhas looks like a born King, she is a born Queen. Her characterization is by far THE BEST - the way she stands up to Sivagami - when Sivagami sends gold to get her hand in marriage for Bhallaladeva, her retort to Baahubali during her baby shower, the way she defends herself in the court for chopping off fingers of a Mahishmathi commander - simply WOW!\n\nRana has aced as Bhallala Deva. The gaunt face, void of any fat combined with a 6 pack body, gives a natural meanness to his face. He easily takes it up a notch with an ice cold look here or a devious smirk there. Be it the sly smiles that hide his hunger for the throne, the expressions of rage that make him hack the dead Baahubali's body, he knows where to hold back and where to go out and bare it all. He really manages to send a shiver down one's spine in terror and that is a huge victory.\n\nThe phrase \"one and only\" fits Ramya Krishnan perfectly. Her majestic screen presence in spite of being short, the combination of royal exuberance and dominance in her face, the eyes that can express compassion one second and fury the next - OMG, she gave me goosebumps so many times. Especially in the opening scene where she walks with a pot of fire on her head unperturbed by an approaching mad elephant. She should give classes on how to walk like THAT(hell or high water, I do what I do).\n\nSathyaraj as Kattappa and Nasser as Pingala Deva have played their roles very beautifully. There are no big surprises in their characters.\n\nTamannah is largely absent in part 2, save one or 2 scenes where she tries to show some grit and effort to fight, but goes unnoticed.\n\nW.r.t. script, I felt that a lot of time was spent on the flashback and there was a sense of hurry when it came to the present where Shivu had to avenge his father's death. Jumping into\na war with mighty Mahishmathi without any strategy did not sound wise. I expected that Kattappa will seek the help of Aslam Khan(Kicha Sudeep) or Baahubali's allies and advise Shivu about any weaknesses of Bhallaladeva or secrets of the Mahishmathi fort. The romance track in part 1 could have been replaced with some more story from part 2 & a couple of scenes that show brainstorming for the final war would have given it a sense of completeness.\n\nThe letdown for me in this movie is the character of Sivagami. The one who was the epitome of justice and fairness in part 1,falling prey to hearsay and giving/changing orders at the fall of a hat - she looks like a gullible person with a frail ego who has no regard for due diligence when it comes to matters of the state. If not for her saving the life of Mahendra Baahubali, she could very well be seen as a villain in part 2. May be \"vinaasha kaale, vipareedha buddhi\" is true in her case. When the time is bad, you make cloudy judgements and act in haste.\n\nI can nitpick on the script a little bit, but nothing, I mean nothing will take away from the magnum opus this movie truly is. I am SO, SO, SO PROUD to be hailing from the region where this movie was made and speaking the same language as them.\n\nMusic - BGM is great and the songs sound great in Telugu, not that good in Tamil. I don't know if it is because I heard them in Telugu first, but so much is lost in translation. I had the\nsame feeling about part 1 songs. Somehow, Madhan Kaarky's lyric engineering does not sit well with me.\n\nSabu Cyril(Production Designer) and Rama Rajamouli and Prashanti (costume designers) need a special mention for their fabulous work. One cannot wrap one's head around the sheer amount of work, a production of this magnitude would have warranted. Hats off to the entire team, especially Rajamouli and his vision!",

The VFX has set a benchmark for Indian cinema being on par with many Hollywood flicks. But not everything in this epic is good. The end war was missing the magic unlike the war in Part 1. The BGM didn't help it either (in the war only, the remaining bgm was good). Another complaint i have is in the beginning of the movie the Elephants looked so CGI it could have done better. Apart from these two complaints the rest of films packs enough action and lots of emotion to enjoy the ride",
