The film really did stick to that and I personally appreciated it so much! Also, I felt the dedication of many oil painters, actors and personnel on this film. Just imagining it makes me speechless. Five (5) starry, starry night stars!!!",

            "content": "This is an extraordinary film - the painting style animation looks visually amazing and the story is compelling, although, inevitably, sad. I found the various characters intriguing and I found it a very watchable film. I believe it took many years to make, due to the traditional paint based animation and it shows. I felt like I could see the emotion in the various characters eyes, with hints of teardrops appearing in the corners of their eyes and the like.\n\nI am quite a big fan of animation, have always been since a child, so this film had appealed to me for a long time and I honestly can't say it disappointed. I was both interested to see it in terms of the painting work used to create it but also in terms of being interested in the story of the troubled person who was Vincent Van Gogh and this film certainly taught me more about him. I was aware of his time spent in Arles, in France, having visited the area a few summers ago and this place features in the film, so I found it very interesting, with good voice work from the cast, including Josh Burdett, Holly Earl, John Sessions, Helen McCrory and Chris O'Dowd.\n\nEven if your not especially keen on Van Gogh, I would still recommend it as a different type of film from 'regular' CGI based animation or the like. However, I should probably point out that this is rated 12 in the UK due to the theme of mental illness being inevitably present but also there was a scene depicting a prostitute with a customer and the infamous gifting of Vincents cut ear is also depicted, so I wouldn't recommend it be shown to pre-teens certainly.",

Loving Vincent is truly a unique and special movie that should serve as an example of innovation and creativity to all aspiring animators. On surface level, the movie explores the life and mysterious death of Vincent Van Gogh, but on a deeper level the movie entails themes of the artist's struggle, legacy, death, human connection, and perhaps more importantly what it means to live. These themes and messages are all the more well impacted by the oil painted world we see. The level of hardworking and passion put into this film is truly inspiring and obvious. Loving Vincent is an achievement and celebrated not only one of history's greatest and most complex painters but also a celebration of all forms of art itself whether that be actual art, music, film, acting, etc. it has it all.  A truly beautiful and unique film.",

            "content": "Real Cinematic Art\nCinema has always been a gloried artwork and we have much more authentic proof in astounding Loving Vincent.\n\nAn animated construction entirely brought to life by oil paintings, is quintessential proof that cinema has still barely scratched the surface of its reaches. Loving Vincent is landmark event for animation and even biographical storytelling through its majestic vision at the last days of Vincent Van Gogh.\n\nSet a after the death of fabled painter, Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth) is possessed with a letter from Van Gogh to his brother Theo before his death, and begins the journey to deliver it. While on call, Roulin encounters all the people close to Vincent before is death gradually trying to put the pieces of what cause his sudden suicide. From this we are taken back to key moments of Van Gogh's life mesmerizingly displayed through the living oil paintings.\n\nGenerated by 65,000 paintings by over a 100 artist, Loving Vincent is living work of art. First shot as a live action depiction then adapted into paintings, the immersive gallery of scenes is a first in new format of animation. Directors: Dorota Kobiela, and Hugh Welchman take Van Gogh's own artistry into his own biography (almost), from Citizen Kane style narrative, assessing and celebrating the life of one of the worlds if not the most famous painter. From this production becomes transporting cinema experience into the world of Van Gogh and an enchanting watch of magnificent painting and animation.\n\nOf course what is the fundamental strength of Loving Vincent is its captivating artwork which for every moment is spectacular, and then you have the real narrative of Van Gogh's last days which on its own is an affectionate journey. Even if you don't not much about the life of Van Gogh this is an enthralling experience.\n\nThe monumental presence of the paintings is consistently exceptional with wonderful detail and creation put into it. One of the sensational efforts for the film is its sketch of the real actors, making them instantly recognisable on screen, bringing their performance into the art. Although our eyes are set on visual presence, Clint Mansell's score is also a tear-jerking atmosphere throughout the film, capturing the melancholy as well as joy of Van Gogh.\n\nLoving Vincent is a visual sensation, proving the amazing talent that animation brings to the screen. This is by far one of the most significant films of the year and is must see experience, especially for art students.",

Every scene of the movie is beautiful and it delivers everything that the people expected it to in the artistic aspect. There is so much going on in each frame that you might often ignore the plot and appreciate the beauty of this one. The story is still very strong for me, it's not one detective story where we find the cause of death of Van Gogh. I believe we all play Armand, the lead character, trying to find the cause of his death. We're told the story of Vincent through people, through their memories, we see the different perception of people towards Vincent. While of course each one of us wants to find the cause of death, we soon realize the futility of doing so. Numerous people might not like the story but the film represents the legacy of Van Gogh left behind in his paintings and in people, in their time with Vincent. It's about how legacies survive long, long after the person dies and how even a self-hating painter believed that his legacy would also survive.",

            "content": "Loving Vincent (2017): 7 out of 10: An art film in more ways than one, Loving Vincent is the tale of a postmaster's son asked by his father to deliver a letter from Vincent Van Gogh to his brother Theo. \n\nSoon this simple task becomes a journey into finding out why Vincent van Gogh committed suicide or even if he did. What we end up with is a Rashomon style story where everyone in the small provincial village where Vincent died has a different and often conflicting story. \n\nThe Good: Let's start with the six hundred pound oil painting in the room. Loving Vincent has a gimmick, and it is a doozy. Each frame (all 65,000 of them) are handpainted by a group of 120 painters. The actors are then animated and rotoscoped onto the oil paintings. \n\nNow I know rotoscoped is a scary word. We all remember Ralph Bakshi use of rotoscoping for his animated features Wizards (1977) and The Lord of the Rings (1978). Scary times indeed. Loving Vincent's technique, guided by a bigger budget and forty years of technology improvements, is spot on. \n\nThe settings and many of the characters are right out of Vincent Van Gogh's paintings, and scenes often start with a classic Van Gogh painting and then has the action seamlessly move on from there. Whether in movies or even video games such gimmicks often lose their effect after viewing for a while. While I certainly got used to the technique in Loving Vincent, it never became unnoticeable. \n\nThe Bad: Loving Vincent is a quiet tale that fails a task one can give biography. Would this story be interesting if it happened to someone not famous? The answer here is a solid no. The movie's story reminds one of a walking simulator video game rather than a film with our protagonist walking around chatting people up and then going into flashback cutscenes (Done in a different black and white sketch style like that Take on Me a-ha video). We get a decent picture of Vincent in his last days and the people around him, but the central mystery of whether he killed himself or whether someone else shot him doesn't seem pressing to the characters on the screen let alone the audience watching the film.\n\nAs good as the painting technique is I think it is a smidge of a shame that the film is shot in 4:3 full screen. I understand this is an artistic decision that matches the paintings, but I do wish there wasn't so much empty real estate on my television for such a beautiful film. \n\nThe Ugly: Look if you don't want to spend the coin getting the Don McLean rendition of Starry Starry Night, you should be able to find a better cover than the one that Lianne La Havas warbles at the end of this film. It isn't quite the Bahama Men √Ø¬ø 1/2~s version of Crocodile Rock from Crocodile Hunter Collision Course but still. \n\nIn Conclusion: The fascinating part of Loving Vincent for me were the photos at the end of the real people in the movie. Not the actors mind you but the actual subjects.  Marguerite Gachet, the young nineteen-year-old girl at the center of the mystery, didn't die till 1949. We think of Vincent Van Gogh as being so long ago, but in reality, it wasn't. Like the old west in America, it is a time that is in the distant past but still within reach. Or to use the standard measurement. Vincent Van Gogh is to Back to the Future's Enchantment Under the Sea dance as the Enchantment Under the Sea dance is to us today.",

            "content": "Here stands a film perhaps as oddly remarkable as the great artist whose demise it documents; Loving Vincent is a Polish-UK co-production charting the final days (and the shady aftermath of which) of Vincent Van Gogh. But what is truly extraordinary about this film is that it is the first animated film created entirely with oil paints, in the notable style of its eponymous painter. Loving Vincent is an ambitious visual experiment, every frame avowedly hand-painted in a pastiche of Van Gogh's work. It's an experiment that certainly works; landscapes swirl dreamily across the screens and oozing strokes of paint litter the faces of the film's players. There is something strangely ethereal about the animation; it's utterly immersive and beautiful and surely can be appreciated simply for its flair and the pain-staking commitment required to create it. The film was also shot in live-action beforehand; we see Chris O'Dowd, Saoirse Ronan and the rest of the cast embodied within the brushstrokes, in a strangely satisfying and delightfully expressive way. There's an effortlessness and innovation to the film's design; the same cannot be said, however, of its plot.\nThough not unenjoyable, Loving Vincent's plot is rather thin, comprised of exposition-packed flashbacks and uninspired dialogue. Over-narrated and over-simplified, it never really takes flight or makes much of an impact, despite numerous attempts. We watch as young Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth) seeks to deliver a letter, at the request of his father, from a deceased Vincent to his brother, only to become hooked in finding out the truth behind the artist's death among the witnesses of his final days. The cast, led by Booth, are lively enough, but are not enough to distract one from a flimsy narrative that begins to feel like a tame episode of Poirot. Despite this, the film is entertaining enough and it's clear that the true intentions of directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman is to impress via the film's visuals rather than its story.\nLoving Vincent is a definite mixed bag of a film; visually, it's exquisite and never excessively dull, but its formulaic and uninspired plot cannot be ignored. For a movie that claims to be a biopic of Vincent Van Gogh, it tells us very little about the man itself, functioning far more as a standard who-dunnit that is gorgeous to watch but, on occasion, feels self-admiring. An interesting film that is worth watching just for its pure style.",

Notably, all of the paintings are in the unmistakable style of Van Gogh - and some of his works are reproduced (of course).  So, the film is amazing to look at and takes me back fondly to my memories of the Van Gogh exhibit here in Melbourne last year (the wheatfields and the crows).  The plot follows the son (Armand) of Van Gogh's friend and subject Postman Joseph Roulin who travels to Paris after the painter's death to deliver a letter from Vincent to his brother Theo.  When Theo turns out to be dead, Armand travels to Arles to interview the people who knew Vincent at the end, including Doctor Gachet and Marguerite Gachet (voiced by Saoirse Ronan).  He comes up with a theory that Van Gogh might have been murdered rather than a suicide; however, I'm not sure this really adds enough tension to the plot to sustain interest.  Having recently watched Kirk Douglas as Vincent in Lust for Life (1956), I knew many of the details of the painter's life and perhaps the plot could be less clear without this background knowledge.  The remake of Don McLean's \"Starry, starry night\" playing over the end credits is a nice touch.",

It fascinated me from the moment I watched the trailer months ago.\n\nArmand, the postman's son, a man with little to no aspirations, arrives at the last hometown of the painter to deliver his last letter. The audience dives into the story through his eyes, the eyes of a stranger, providing a fresh perspective as the character's curiosity, and our own, unravels an unexpected mystery.\n\nVisually stunning, the creators of this piece of art in animated form set out to achieve the impossible, to tell the story of the last days of Vincent Van Gogh's life through sixty-five thousand paintings.Loving Vincent\n\nThe art form of film is different from painting. Painting is one particular moment in time, frozen. Film is fluid, seeming to move through space and time. So, prior to and during the live action shoot the painting design team spent a year re-imagining Vincent's painting into the medium of film.\n\nLoving Vincent was first shot as a live action film with actors then hand-painted over frame-by-frame in oils. The final effect is an interaction of the performance of the actors playing Vincent's famous portraits, as well as the painting animators, bringing these characters into the medium of paint.\n\nIn an experience like no other, Loving Vincent takes the audience on a journey through his life and death, allowing us to step right into his artwork where we wonder about the meaning behind the scenes unveiling before our eyes.Loving Vincent\n\nArmand sets off in search of the truth and finds that sometimes, a man's fame is not made of what he set out to achieve during his lifetime but of the legacy that he leaves behind.\n\nDorota Kobiela had planned to combine her passion for painting and film, for her sixth animated short, and to paint the entire film herself. However, once she expanded Loving Vincent into a feature film the task of writing and directing was such that she had to content herself with directing the [124] painters. Although, Dorota managed to set some time aside to paint a few shots herself.\n\nAfter falling in love with Polish painter and director, Dorota Kobiela, Hugh Welchman also fell in love with her film project, Loving Vincent.

            "content": "- Art buff or not, you won't be able to help Loving Vincent -\n\nAlthough my first love was the performing arts, a few painters have always captured my imagination. Of those, the red-headed, Dutch, post-impressionist Vincent van Gogh was probably my favorite. I love his bright colors, his quirky portraits, his fields, flowers, and furniture. But above all, to nobody's surprise, I love his wild, dreamlike, and most famous \"Starry Night.\"\n\nThe Polish animated feature Loving Vincent is a bit like \"Starry Night.\" It's a simple premise: a young man is charged with delivering a letter from the recently dead Vincent to his brother Theo. It's quiet and soothing: the movie keeps at a pretty low pitch mostly, with lots of landscapes and scenes of people holding conversations. And yet, somehow, it's unlike anything you've ever seen: after the scenes were filmed and edited, a team of 100 artists oil-painted over every single frame.\n\nThe final product of such an endeavor? An epic exploration of the life, love, and death of Vincent Van Gogh through his own eyes, the way he looked at the world.\n\nLoving Vincent is not flashy, and wouldn't endear too much re-watching if it had merely been filmed and produced in the traditional way. But in its particular style of animation, the movie is not only able to give us a fresh way of humanizing this bizarre, legendary painter, but the filmmakers are able to bring dozens of his most beloved paintings to life.\n\nOur protagonist (Douglas Booth, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies; Noah) is Armand Roulin, of van Gogh's \"Yellow Jacket\" portrait. We also meet \"Marguerite Gachet at the Piano\" (Saoirse Ronan, Ladybird; Brooklyn)  the Postman Roulin (Chris O'Dowd, Molly's Game; The Incredible Jessica James, and the \"Old Man in Sorrow\" (Bill Thomas, Alice Through the Looking Glass). We glimpse the sunflowers, the irises, and the majestic stars shining over the Rhone.\n\nVincent van Gogh was, perhaps, a man born out of time. Depressed and poetic, quiet yet dramatic, living in poverty, and suffering from something like bipolar disorder or epilepsy, he remains a bittersweet hero for the modern artist. He is a reminder of the importance of human empathy and friendship. His story makes me humbly grateful for modern medicine and spurs me on to make the art that brings me joy, even if I never grow rich from my labors.\n\n\"What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?\"\n\nVincent wrote that phrase in a letter to his brother Theo. I like to think that sentiment inspired the directors (Dorota Kobiela, The Flying Machine; & Hugh Welchman, La Vie en Rose), oil painters, and crew of Loving Vincent. It certainly inspires me to take the leap to repaint my days with fresh new life of wonder and imagination.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/loving-vincent, and was written by Debbie Holloway.

The movie has a lot of dialogue and monologs in it, and the writing is absolutely fantastic, each character feels alive. Rotoscoping was used, all the scenes were acted out on a green screen, placed in a painting and over 100 painters painted the entire picture again, and as the first oil painted film, its quite simply genius. The soundtrack is also way more enjoyable then expected, I will have a listen to it later.

            "content": "LOVING VINCENT\n\nThe film is a gimmick of Linklater proportions, it's a feat as the first oil frame-by-frame painted movie. It's also a visually stunning film, expressive in its use of color and even \"lighting\", maintaining a tight relationship to the artist's technique and mood. Just like a Van Gogh, its details are less important than the overall expression, the latter relying almost uniquely on the former. Yet, a movie's greatness can't rest solely upon novelty, because if that was the case, The Jazz Singer and Avatar would be great films. In fact, seldom does first get to be best when you look back to the cinematic history. So, although Loving Vincent is certainly a courageous endeavour, we mustn't forget that it is highly flawed, as most experiments are when you test them for the first time. It's a highly frustrating movie, both for its script consisting of 100% of exposition and for its structure. For example, something bugged me in the first part of the film in which a flashback does not appear in black and white for no apparent  reason. I was fortunate enough to get the directors in the room to get my question asked but their answer did not justify its purpose at all. It is well regarded that there's strength in repetition so in order to make a cohesive point sometimes, when the execution wasn't perfect at first try, you have to hit the nail once again. The contrary is also true, as the movie utilizes the flashback mechanism so many times to point of it becomes wearisome, when a flashback seems almost gratuitous. When you are constantly alternating between present and past, it gives both insufficient importance, in a cycle of neglect. That was the main force of my frustration, as the movie kept repeating a part of film grammar that is strongest when used scarcely (or executed to perfection like in Citizen Kane). Ultimately, the movie's greatest flaw consists on avoiding what Van Gogh was filled to the brim with: the will to dare and to cut off a ear.",

While he is there, he tries to put together the puzzle pieces to determine what events led up to the artist's alleged suicide.  Now you may already be aware of the most noteworthy thing about this: every single frame of this film is fully painted from start to finish.  You just don't ever get to see that much effort put into animated films nowadays with the sole exception of stop-motion, and even then, those films are getting rarer and rarer.  It seems like a ton of extra work, but it is obviously appropriate given the subject matter at hand.  It is a pretty trippy effect when you first see it in motion, and it takes you a few minutes to adjust.  This movie is a work of art to be sure, but I really didn't dig the story at all.  I do feel like this is more of an experiment than anything else, and to pay this movie a compliment, the artwork is undeniably stunning.  There are different styles featured throughout, and they vary from scene to scene.  You can pause any single frame to this and people will likely think that it is a screensaver for your television, it is seriously that level of high detail.  If you can't afford the local art exhibition at the museum because it is too expensive, you might want to try putting this on as a cheaper alternative.  I love the look of this, but as previously stated, I never got into the story.  It builds van Gogh up to be this myth, but while it is about him, it is not really his story.  It's this other random guy's narrative, and it became very clear early on that they are just pulling a Rashomon here.  Everybody has their own version of the truth of events, and you never are 100% certain on what actually happened.  The story devolves into a lot of \"he said she said\", which I didn't care for.  The unreliable narrator is a storytelling device that I have seen before, and unfortunately, I've seen it done better and more interestingly.  I can't take anything away from the look of this film, and Loving Vincent will at least be remembered as being the first to attempt something of this nature.  Given that it is a Rashomon style story, there are a ton of flashbacks, and I felt that it got in the way of the forward movement of the plot, but that might just be me.  As it stands, this is a beautiful movie that I never connected with, which is a shame, because I was really excited for it, given everything I heard about the production.",

This film is the first fully painted animated feature film, and unfortunately, that is the one thing going for this film. Every scene is so beautiful, every brush stroke. There are black and white flashback scenes that are so realistically painted, for a brief moment I actually forgot I was watching a painted film. The way the backgrounds are emphasized in any given scene, second by second, how the clouds moved across the sky. How a river would flow, the wind blowing leaves down the road, or even the change of sunlight shown on a character's clothing. Subtle moments such as these really make this film stand out. Each of the film's 65,000 frames is an oil painting on canvas, using the same technique as van Gogh, created by a team of 125 amazing painters.\n\nIt would be unfair for me to only praise this very unique animation style-despite that it deserves every bit of praise-and touch on nothing else. The story is a murder mystery, taking place one year after Vincent van Gogh's death, diving deep into whether the death was the result of a suicide or a possible murder. You may be mesmerized by the amazing visuals, but once you begin paying attention to the story, it may immediately take you out. The script isn't great, which draws away from what you are seeing on the screen. The story touches very briefly on van Gogh's life, relationship with his brother, and the mutilation of his ear. It leaves much desired when those aspects are so much more interesting within this story, than the issue at hand.\nAbsolutely amazing cast, but even here lies a problem. Taking place in France, the entire cast consists of English and Irish actors; their accents are so noticeable, their voices alone are enough to pull you out of a scene. Saoirse Ronan and Chris O'Dowd, two Irish actors I adore, and I had the hardest time feeling any legitimacy in their French characters with such hard Irish accents. The same goes for Jerome Flynn and Helen McCrory, two stellar English actors, but portraying French characters their accents took me right out of their scenes. Now this may not affect other people seeing this film, but it was extremely noticeable for me and quite jarring. I can't help but wonder if the film would have been done better justice by keeping it a short film.",

In some cases the perspective is influenced by the beliefs of the person commenting. The letter carrier provides a means of touching bases and introducing possible theories on how he died.

            "content": "Film critics tend to talk down on a film when it seems like the core idea of the film is a gimmick. Three-dimensional movies were the talk of the town about 10-15 years ago and have now become an annoyance to many. Loving Vincent is the newest film to try something new in terms of how it tells its story. Being completely painted by hand, this movie moves along as if it had been animated about 60 years ago. A more recent comparison would be to say it looks like A Scanner Darkly, but I truly feel this film's much more unique than even that. This is a wonderfully engaging premise and even without that aspect, here's why I believe everyone needs to see this film, even just based on the portraits alone.\n\nLoving Vincent tells the story of Armand, a young man who has been tasked with the devastating venture of delivering Vincent Van Gogh's final letter. Upon arrival of the town that Van Gogh ultimately met his untimely end, Armand finds himself incredibly interested in the mystery surrounding this death. Becoming more of an investigation film than a simple journey, Loving Vincent takes you on a ride that's full of insight and powerful moments between characters. I didn't think I would've been so moved by this movie, but the performances/voiceover work was truly astounding, sucking me right into this beautiful portrait of a film.\n\nIt's one thing to commend this film for having truly breathtaking visuals, but that's also the understatement of the year. This movie blows away any animated film from last year in terms of being uniquely made. From the nods to Van Gogh's classic works, to the motion and dissolves between scenes, everything about this film felt seamless. That being said, there's a large obstacle that many viewers will have to get over as soon as the film begins as well, being the fact that it's entirely painted by hand. This wonderful aspect of the movie will definitely be off-putting to some, due to the fact that it's the first film of its kind and may be bizarre to look at. For myself, I found it absolutely fascinating, plain and simple.\n\nAs someone who prefers other forms of art than paintings, I do admire a great piece of art, regardless of the medium. This movie explores a life that pretty much everyone has heard of at some point in time, and I must admit, I didn't know this story was as complex of a mystery as this movie suggests it is. From motivational speeches about life and the universe to questions brought up in a philosophical way, I was incredibly immersed in each and every one of the scenes throughout this film. There's hardly any downtime because every line of dialogue progresses this story forward at a rapid rate.\n\nIn the end, Loving Vincent may not be for everyone, especially due to its unique look, but the story itself is something I believe everyone needs to see. There is a scene that closes out the movie that I still have playing over and over in my head. As I mentioned many times, this movie is filled with memorable lines of dialogue that truly makes you think about life itself and the universe surrounding us. This may seem biased and this particular reaction will surely not hit everyone the way it hit me, but I found this to be a remarkable picture. I fear this movie will go fairly unnoticed, which is a shame because literally, every aspect of this film is wondrous to behold. This is one of my favorite films of 2017.",

They could have easily used the live action reference footage and painted the people as Van Gogh did. Also take the beginning scene. Van Gogh painted in a broken/warped perspective style for a reason, the film nails it at first but then relies on reference footage and goes back to realistic correct perspective. If this had been a James Cameron production, like Titanic, he would have made sure every single detail was just as Van Gogh had intended. This isn't the Van Gogh I've grown up loving my whole life.

            "content": "A visual tour de force, this is a projection of Van Gogh's art by the 100 or more artists who painted every scene. It is rich with animations of the real-life actors, who are painted convincingly in the Van Gogh style, using scenes based on his actual and famous paintings, which spring astonishingly to life as the action arises.  Alternating with the Van Gogh pictures are biographical flashbacks, which are painted or drawn in black and white photo-realism, again of a very high artistic quality.  The story involves an inquiry into the circumstances of Van Gogh's death. In this, it is less satisfying dramatically, with loose ends, not grasping the nettle, and stopping short of an accusation of mortal envy.  The Gachet interview scene seems too easy and forgiving. The alternative explanation of the fatal gunshot, a mischief by an errant youth, also lacks reality because the inquisitor never questions the (then) boy. The film apologises for the failure of those around Van Gogh to save him.  This show is in no way humorous, yet it is recalls The Life of Brian, where Brian's followers parade by, complimenting him for sacrificing himself, instead of rescuing him. Here, the film dwells on Van Gogh's forgiveness of the unforgivable - \"don't blame anyone\" he is reported to have said, as he lay dying needlessly of an untreated gunshot wound, while several characters come by to see him.  The film produces evidence that he was not suicidal, and that suicide was unlikely in the circumstances, and then it goes soft. The critical point about Van Gogh's art is his reach into the condition of the poor, farm workers, women and the hard struggle of life, and into nature.  He related most easily with and lived among working people and peasants: in that sense he was a traitor to his class. To combine these sentiments with his artistic power must have driven his well to do friends to distraction, particularly those who wished they could paint. If as it seems Van Gogh also won the heart of a bourgeois woman, half his age, the resentment he inspired must have run deep. The film dips its toes into this unpalatable water, and then weakens, in favour of vague philosophising - was it just Vincent just being Vincent, and did it really matter whether he committed suicide or was killed.  Really? Van Gogh's paintings were both sophisticated and fearless; he had enormous generosity of spirit. This film is loving compliance more than it is loving Vincent, and in the end it leaves him to the wolves.",

It is a fine work of art, in moving pictures, creating a deeper connection with paintings of Van Gogh's, transmogrifying viewers into early 20th Century Bohemian Europeans. I recommend seeing it.

The film took over two years to make utilizing the skills of 125 professional artists who painted nearly a thousand canvases to create the 6,500 frames that comprise Loving Vincent, the first fully hand painted animated feature film. Loving Vincent takes place a year after the death of Vincent Van Gogh (Robert Gulaczyk.) Vincent¬ís good friend Postmaster Roulin (Chris O¬íDowd) asks his son Armand (Douglas Booth) to hand deliver Van Gogh¬ís last letter to his brother Theo. Armand reluctantly accepts the task & begins a complicated & mysterious journey. After visiting Pere Tanguy (John Sessions) who tells Armand that Theo died shortly after hearing of his brother¬ís death, Armand heads to Auvers-sur-Olse to the home of Dr. Gachet (Jerome Flynn) who took care Vincent after his release from the asylum. While waiting to see Dr. Gachet, Armand begins conversations with a variety of people who had some interaction with Van Gogh prior to his death ; Adeline Ravoux (Eleanor Tomlinson), the temporary proprietress of the local inn where Vincent was staying, Dr. Gachet¬ë s housekeeper, Louise Chevalier (Helen McCrory), Dr. Gachet¬ís sheltered daughter Marguerite (Saoirse Ronan), & local boatman (Adan Turner). As each person reveals their version of the events leading up to Vincent¬ís leading death, Armand begins to question whether Vincent really committed suicide or was murdered. Loving Vincent is directed by the husband & wife team of Dorota Kobiela & Hugh Welchman who co-wrote the screenplay with Jacek Dehnel. They have created a uniquely beautiful tribute to the heartbreaking & compelling story of a true genius¬ís brief but prolific life. The oil painted animation was stunning with each scene painted in Van Gogh¬ís signature style. The performances from cast, who performed in front of a green screen, were captivating. Loving Vincent is a film for those who are fans of amazing art & powerful film. MUST-SEE FILM.",

I was able to view this film at a small theater in Chicago called the Music Box Theater. It was like an old classic film theater with projectors that projected film. It was a really cool experience and honestly, it made watching this film even more fun.\n\n\"Loving Vincent\" is certainly an inventive film, and definitely one of its own kind. It takes advantage of multiple aspects used in film. It's like a combination between animation and stop-motion story-telling, however, it's told entirely through oil drawing paintings. I mean, how fucking cool is that? If that doesn't interest you as a filmmaker or as a fan, then I don't know what will. Every scene in this movie was painted over hand by hand, and it looked absolutely beautiful. Over 100 painters were used during the production, and it certainly came out beautifully. \n\nThe way the paintings were captured looked really good. It really did look like everything was in constant motion. What I think they did was they painted layers over and over the base painting, which gave they illusion of the painting moving as the filmmakers snapshotted each frame. It can be a little weird to look at at first, as your eyes have to adjust to unique movement that the frames display, but you quickly adjust and it becomes so worth it.\n\nThe sound design was also something that was very crucial and beneficial to this sound. I wouldn't say that the score or the sound effects were completely out of this world, but they added so much to something that is 2D. They brought life and realism to these gorgeous paintings and it made it feel so real. At times, it looked like these scenes were real, as it looked that spectacular. The sound design and editing team really put a lot into this film, making the experience even more memorable. \n\nWhat I didn't like about this film, which was actually a big negative, was the story itself. No, I'm not saying Van Gogh's story is uninteresting, because it certainly isn't. But the story is just the main character walking around for an hour and a half, having conversations about what really happened with Van Gogh. The movie really was all narrative, and they missed a huge opportunity by not telling the movie with the imagery. The imagery was such a huge part, but I couldn't find myself attached to the story because it was told in a very mundane way. \n\nIn the end, \"Loving Vincent\" was a very solid film and one that had a really unique take on it. I would certainly watch this film just to experience the innovative story-telling, even if it's not the strongest film as a whole.",

No effort was made to tie the narrative to the film's unique medium, creating a dissonant feel. Any attempt to discuss Van Gogh as an artist or a thinker was destroyed to make way for a contrived who-done-it story that brazenly ignored the truth of severe depression and attempted to validate the late artist by denying the truth of his experience. What could have been a beautiful way to explore this man and the way he saw the world ended up being a meandering journey which just so happened to be oil painted, and which left me feeling somewhat insulted by the end.",

Every shot shimmers as the scenes transform from a static view of one of Van Gogh's paintings to a more conventional \"camera\" image, albeit painted in V.G. style. It reminded me a little of the Monty Python animated shorts with famous paintings. It's a real treat, but many may have to sit far back because every part of the screen is quivering with small motions of bright colors.",

            "content": "There's two immediate challenges I see when thinking about a film like this, and it has to mentioned, this is the first film of it kind. The first handed animated picture that actually captures the actors performances and not just their voice talents. Firstly is how on Earth do you make a film that's not only painted, but is done entirely in the style of their chosen artist which leads me to their second challenge; how does one (or two) tell a story about Vincent Van Gogh? \n\nI was fortunate enough to catch a Q&A screening for it's UK/ROI premiere which was hosted by London's own National Gallery; and I am so glad I did with answers being provided by Hugh Welchman, one half of the husband and wife team who directed the picture, one of the producers, Ivan Mactaggart, actors, Douglas Booth and Helen McCory; and one of the many artists that worked on the film, Sarah Wimperis. All of which gave a deeper understanding and a growing appreciation of this astounding film. \n\nWhat do we know about Van Gogh? Or what do we think we know about the troubled artist? He's considered the father of modern and western art, he cut his own ear off after what some suspect to be during a binge on absinthe. We all know many of his famous paintings of landscapes, portraits and self portraits, whether we recognise them to by him or not. \n\nSo how do they successful tell an interesting story of the artist that would appeal to the masses without becoming a documentary? Well, there's a brilliant narrative choosing to tell part of his story from after his supposed suicide turning this into an intriguing murder mystery that isn't a far-fetched story. It's been in constant debate among biographers, art historians and even the Van Gogh Museum regarding his supposed suicide, which leads this story down an open mystery.  \n\nMuch of the story is based on an immense amount of research as see through the story of Armand Roulin, one of Van Gogh subjects who reluctantly goes to Paris to deliver a letter to Van Gogh's brother, Theo; but he inadvertently unearths suspicion when he hears opposing stories from the people who knew Van Gogh. These parts being taken directly from the conflicting statements written after his death. \n\nDouglas Booth leads an incredible cast, playing Armand Roulin, who is amazing and is fast becoming one of my favourite actors, having seen him in The Limehouse Golem earlier this summer. I don't know what it is about him, but I honestly believe he would make an incredible Freddie Mercury. There's a strong supporting cast, all of whom had to model their respective character's pose from their portraits, and all give great performances that really adds another dimension to the animation. \n\nThe animation itself is a totally separate feat all together, never having seen anything like it. Some might suspect the technique of rotoscoping being used but the film is entirely hand painted and uses stop-motion animation. This was achieved with the incredible collaboration of some 120 different artists and painters who worked endlessly for over 2 years. Now these artists are not animators, so not only did they have to learn to understand animation they had to unlearn their own style and adopt Van Gogh's in so to bring his paintings to life. \n\nSo many of his works are used with his landscape pieces setting the scenes such as his 'Yellow House', 'The Night Caf√©' and 'The Church at Auvers' whereas his portraits are used to introduce each character of the story, each being real life people he had met and painted. Sarah Wimperis, one the artists who worked on the film spent 5 months painting the wheat fields, around 300 frames worth that equated to about 30 seconds of screen time. The total project resulting in some 65,000 paintings ending up with around 900 canvases which some had been sold to help finance the film, some gifted to cast and crew and the rest currently being auctioned off. \n\nIt's spectacularly unique and stunningly vivid using Van Gogh colour palette throughout apart from the gorgeous black and white sequences which depicted times before his death with the vibrant colourful scenes representing the present narrative. The film's ratio is also respectful of Van Gogh, using the academy ratio which is the closest format to the canvases he would have painted on. \n\nAll of this accompanied by an impressive and alluring score from Clint Mansell, a composer the makers originally wanted and who at first refused. The studio had used a playlist of Mansell's previous pieces to help inspire the film creation. Glady Mansell changed his mind last minute and agreed to work on the project composing thrilling and enchanting tracks that are titled and inspired by Van Gogh famous pieces. Lianne La Havas does an amazing rendition of Don McLean's 'Vincent' to boot. \n\nOverall, this is the most ambitious film I have seen this year, and one of the ambitious films of all time that has created a masterpiece, a perfect amalgamation of stunning artistry and enthralling storytelling that's both educational and inspirational. I would be very excited to see other artists life's work portrayed in such a creative and visually brilliant way. Did I hear right that Gogos would be an idea? \n\nRunning Time: 9\nThe Cast: 8\nPerformance: 8\nDirection: 10\nStory: 10\nScript: 10\nCreativity: 10\nSoundtrack: 10\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being an unique, visual masterpiece that melds perfectly with great storytelling. \n\n95% 10/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

Even with authentic settings and a cast of colourful character both figuratively and literally, the film is a hugely investing and outstandingly beautiful film to see, almost verging from the very dramatic plotting to the eye catching surrealist aspect of the art-house sphere this film is fixed within. While it's hard to determine whether or not the mystery of the late painter's death can be explained, especially alongside the historical accuracy aspect of this film, everything else about it from the initial premise alone is enough to recommend to all audiences young and old to experience even well before you could say 'Oscar for Best Animated Film' since the oil work paintings are it's signature look while the feel comes from the technical and written aspects alone. I wish I could give this my perfect grade though something inside me is doubting it figuratively especially along the lines of historical accuracy and overall sustenance.",
