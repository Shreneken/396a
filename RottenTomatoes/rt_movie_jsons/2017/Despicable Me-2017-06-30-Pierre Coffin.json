However, the plot felt a bit scattered and lacked the cohesiveness that made the first two films so enjoyable. The addition of new characters felt forced and unnecessary, and the humor seemed to rely too heavily on slapstick and pop culture references. While it wasn't a bad movie by any means, it just didn't quite live up to the high standards set by its predecessors. All in all, it's worth watching for fans of the franchise, but don't expect it to be as memorable as the first two films.",

            "content": "Loved every second of this one.\n\nIt feels like every subsequent film is better than the last. This franchise is here to stay. I hope they continue making them forever. \n\nTo begin, I feel like this was the best villain yet. Bratts character was much more developed than any other of the villains. His backstory was interesting, he was entertaining in his own retro way. One key thing, he actually put up a strong fight against Gru. Feels like the other villains didn't fight too hard. \n\nAll of the retro vibes emanating from Bratt made me like him even more. He's so stuck In the past and I thought that was cool. \n\nThe inclusion of a brother was a very nice touch, it made the story feel well rounded. It felt like there was no part of the movie where something key wasn't happening. \n\nThe Minions musical number was just so fun to watch, a big highlight if you ask me. What happens as a result, was just comedic genius. The Minions ran the joint. That one scene in the jail was very interesting. They are just so darn cool. \n\nThe scene in the sky, was funny. They bumped into each other and had wtf faces on them. The chase scene with all the Bratt dolls was visually impressive. \n\nI like how they weren't at home for this one. Them being outside of their home base added another element to the movie. All of the colors and scenery in Freedonia were just absolutely gorgeous, as was the entire movie. \n\nThe plot was similar to the other movies. Bad guy steals something, wants to use the item to take over the world. But in this case he just wanted revenge against the industry as a whole. He almost had it.\n\nGru and Drew had very nice chemistry together. I hope he comes back for other installments. Lucy continues to build up her relationship with the girls and they seem to like her now. \n\nI don't normally like anything related to Kristen Wig. I just don't care for any of her work (post SNL). But she has been doing a great job voicing Lucy. Thought it was worth mentioning. \n\nThe best movie in the franchise and they can do no wrong in my eyes. A very entertaining and funny movie which I highly recommend.\n\nThis gets a LennyReviewz Score of: 9/10",

The minions run the prison part is the worst part of the movie and I didn't even pay attention to it. This movie may entertain younger viewers but for older viewers its a big letdown.  In 2024 there will be a 4th one and don't even ask me why if this one didn't do as well as the first two at box office. This movie didn't need to happen but Illumination just wanted to throw something together and make $1.035 billion dollars at box office from general audiences. The movie surprisingly has a lot of adult humor. I give this movie a 4/ 10.",

The voice cast are alright, but the characters themselves aren't all that interesting.\n\nSteve Carell and Trey Parker are good, as is an underused Kristen Wiig. Jenny Slate's character seems forgotten, like I feel like it sets up something with Valerie Da Vinci early on but I don't even recall what happens to her here - a waste, as my first impressions were positive. The minions are fine, not as funny at this point but there's some minor amusement there still.

            "content": "I had watched Despicable Me only so that I could finally understand what the whole deal with the minions was. But I ended up liking the movie and all the characters in that. As a result I decided to watch the sequel as well, which I ended up liking even more than the first one. So I thought why not just go all out and watch every single movie? And so I watched this one, and I really I think it was not something really great, although it did manage to do what it was meant to do: give us the laughs and have a good time.\nDespicable Me 3 is about Gru finding out about his estranged brother Dru who is living a very rich life but does not have the evil nature of Gru and thus is not liked as much by his family. And so grew is forced to take his brother along with him to stop the evil villain Balthazar Bratt, a child actor from the 80s who has faded away with time. Although the minions in this movie are way less than the previous two I don't mind this at all. In fact I kind of found them annoying and I wanted more of the human characters than those yellow Facebook meme sources.\nBalthazar is my favourite villain from this franchise. All his acts are very funny. Whenever he is on the screen you know you are in for some good time. There are often callbacks to his show which is very campy and has barred CGI according to today's times, which is just like how we see shows from the 80s today. He always dances and plays songs whenever he is out on the heist. It is fun to watch Gru and Balthazar fight in the opening scene and also the way Baltasar dances as he defeats all the guards on the ship.\nThe animation of this movie is way better than the previous two, especially when it comes to the action scenes and car chasing. What this movie lacks in however, is the amount of campiness and cliched moments of having an amateur person come out on a secret mission along with the professional friend/family member. In fact the whole idea of the protagonist having an estranged twin brother is a cliched idea which has been used many times in Bollywood films.\nAlthough this isn't a very memorable movie, it does exactly what all the other movies from this franchise do. It is able to create a fantasy world with fun and loving characters who do goofy things and we enjoy them while it lasts. And this is the reason why I don't think this franchise should have more movies. By the time one movie comes we have already forgotten what happened in the previous one. Although I wouldn't say that this is a bad movie, I would definitely say that you would not remember anything other than the good parts once the movie ends, and this is the reason why this movie is so much fun to remember since I don't exactly remember what I didn't like about it.",

The movie has only two major weaknesses that are easy to get past being that there is too many plots and that it relies on juvenile humor and toilet humor more than the last two. However, these are just small flaws and are easy to look past once you see the plots mesh together in a really satisfying way. This movie had some pretty good highlights, like when Gru said his mother told him that his father died of disappointment when he was born as well. Overall, Despicable Me 3 is an extremely enjoyable ride I'd recommend to anyone who can get past its flaws.",

            "content": "I really did not like it. The first movie was a great classic, the second was alright, but the third was straight-up bad and ruined what could have been an at-the-least decent trilogy. Just like most of Illumination Entertainment's movies, it wasn't inspired, it was just a movie made more to get money than anything, because they know people can't resist the minions and cute girls and all that. They know that, and they make up a bad story and bad characters with that stuff to keep people entertained.\n  Basically the story was not the best, but what made it worse was the characters. I can't tell you how much I hate these characters. Balthazar Bratt is one of the worst written villains probably ever in movie history. They have a very lazy backstory to give him at least an identity, and that's about it. I hate his personality; that makes him very dislikeable for me. I cannot stand one second of this guy because he is so incredibly annoying and I found no reason in the movie to like him at all. They try and make him interesting with the 80s themes and his gadgets, but it's obviously again just to give him a lazy identity. Also the main characters were mostly there to keep the plot going, and there was never any time to really show their personalities, except through unnecessary sub-plots, but even then it didn't show. Lucy learning to be a good mother could have turned out great, but I feel in the end of that sub-plot she gained nothing except to yell at whoever when it was her fault in the first place; there was really nothing gained. The sub-plot with Edith and Agnes is clearly to keep the audience interested. There was zero reason to have that sub-plot and bring in the 'unicorn' when it played zero important role except cuteness cause that's what everyone wants, right? And the minion's subplot was also unnecessary, since it played no role into the main story. Again, that was just to keep the story going and people attentive. I really wish if people did things like that it would actually play a key role. But nope, it's just lazy writing.\n  But the worst character of all in my opinion throughout this movie was Dru. I thought he could have been an amazing character, especially since he seemed to be like Gru. But my hopes were cut short the moment I first met him. A hair flip and a squeakier, weaker voice than Gru's did not give me a good first impression. They took Gru, who was a decent character anyways, and just made him worse. Just like Bratt I hated his personality and character; it was very poorly and lazily written.\n  Another thing I did not enjoy about this movie was its lack of family-friendliness. When I think family-friendly, I think EVERYONE is safe to watch it. I know it was rated PG and all, but I still find no excuse to give such cruel jokes like the ones here. I have never seen a family-friendly movie with jokes like that. I don't even find jokes like that in PG-13 movies. And when kids watch minions make those references to women's boobs and stuff like that, I absolutely dislike it. And the butt jokes really do get old; I don't see how twenty butt jokes can carry throughout a movie and have the same effect. I got sick of it after the first three or so.\n  On the other side of things, music was fine. It continued in originality from the first film, but nothing stood out musically (not even Michael Jackson). Designs of characters and screenwriting wasn't my favorite; nothing stood out there. Acting didn't exactly fail except for Dru, which is what you get from having an all-star cast. The only pretty positive thing about this film in general was the animations. Illumination Entertainment does a pretty decent to good job with animations, but there were still parts in there that were fairly lazy, but still not bad.\n  So yeah, I gained nothing watching this film, except that it's money-hoarding and supremely overrated because of other little unimportant elements in the movie. I have seen the first Despicable Me, and I know that people can create a good story from characters, and actually make them likeable. Despicable Me was a nice animated series for me growing up, and seeing the third one take a literally dump just ruined it for me. I've seen Illumination do better with these settings and I want to see them produce a spectacular movie with them. But they get around just fine with other elements like cute animals and the minions and don't focus on actually making the film good, which is why I don't really enjoy Illumination too much.\n  Truly disappointed with this film; I won't be watching it again.",

Firstly, the main positive is that it was nice that they ended it on a cliffhanger and made me excited to know what will happen next, unlike ending it with a dance break like the previous 2 films, due to lack of thought into a meaningful ending. Dry is a decent character, but you can't tell if you are meant to like or dislike him throughout the whole film. At this point in the series, I realised how much much Gru brought to the table when he was a villain rather than a hero. I felt like if they make a Despicable me 4 to end the series, because it can't drag on much longer, it would end with Dru looking after the children with Kucy, whilst Gru returns to his life as A villain. The minions are sidelined in this sequel, and their story would be funny as a short film, but it does not drive the plot at all for a feature film. I also highly disliked the unicorn sub plot, as it felt dragged out and meaningless, and the fact Agnes sold her unicorn at the start felt like it wasted all that time getting it in the first film. Balthasar Bragg is an unbearable villain, with no intentions and back story to remotely suggest making Hollywood float into space. How many times do I have to hear- I've been a Bad boy with that stupid laugh. I had very little patience for him and wanted Vector to come back or something, because Bratt needed shooting with that piranha gun. Also Lucy trying to be a good Mum, the thought was there, but it didn't flow very well. Certain new characters had 0 development for the who,e film, like the Butler and the new head of the AVL and we never even see Gru get his job back so that whole scene may as well have been cut when we see Gru lose his job. It was completely irrelevant or not wrapped up by the end of it. This film is snjoyable to an extent but also has some annoying aspects that take up a good half of the film, in terms of Lucy, unicorns and Balthasar Bratt. However I would have expected from a third instalment that didn't live up to the previous 2 movies and the spinoff, I would not have wanted a 4th film, but after the ending I was eager for a film about Gru and Dru going against each other, and by the end of it Gru would return as a villain. It would only serve the film well if you follow Gru from villain to a hero and making his final debut where he decides he is truly despicable.",

I love that there are even jokes going on in the background. With these movies, the sky is the limit, and it shows. They come up with the most hilarious and creative things to make to storyline more fun. I really appreciate that in a movie. Having said that, I must be honest and say that this movie in not my favorite one in the franchise. It was more action filled and their target group is a bit older for this movie then it was for the ones before. Resolving into sometimes maybe a bit too cruel jokes. (for example, in the beginning, the minions come by in a submarine of some sort but by doing so killing a fish. Doesn't sound that cruel or anything, I know, but you have to see it first, lol)\n\nI love the minions, so if you ask me they could have had a bigger part in this movie. They make me laugh like a mad woman, to be honest #noshame. I loved the storyline where Lucy \"learned\" to be a mom and bonded with the three kids. Talking about the kids, Agnes, I can't, she is the cutest, seriously.\n\nIt's a fun movie that you for sure should watch if you enjoyed the other Despicable Me's, I laughed and I enjoyed it, but in my opinion, it doesn't top the previous once.",

Minions never lived up to it's potential, and Despicable Me 2 lost a lot of the fun because when you make Gru a good guy a lot of the fun is lost.  Honestly, I don't really even remember a lot of Despicable 2.  Despicable Me 3 is a bit better, but it still has a lot of the same problems.  To start with what I like, for one it actually feels like the pop culture datedness of it has been toned down a bit.  Maybe I've just become numb to this in movies recently, but I didn't notice it as much in this one.  The main villain has a distinct 80s theme going, but this is tied to his character, and not just a grab at \"hey, this is what kids are into!\" so it actually works.  They don't just do things like have the characters take selfies to be hip.  A low bar but, godamn, I really appreciated it.  I also really liked the climax, because we get to see Gru use his more villainous skills.  It's essentially a heist sequence, and damnit all I'll just never get sick of a heist scene.  Plus, it's a heist scene in the Despicable Me world, and this is a weirdass world they've created, so it was a ton of fun.  I also actually really liked the arc of the minions.  They leave Gru because he's no fun as a good guy (which makes sense, seriously that did always bother me with their characters), and wind up in prison, which they basically take over.  It's weird, but it leads to some really funny stuff.  But this leads to the movies problems.  It's funny, at times it's really funny, but it's largely a series of loosely connected sketches.  There's not a lot that ties it together.  There's a main villain, Gru finding his brother, the minions leaving, Agnes looking for a unicorn, all this stuff happening and all of it is funny but none of it really connects in any meaningful way.  You can put it on, have some laughs, and be entertained, but I don't see it leaving any real meaningful impact.  It's another marshmallow movie.  Light, fluffy, and makes you feel good, but lacking in any real substance.  The one thing I will say is this is the first time I'm excited for a Despicable Me sequel, because without getting into sequels, it feels like they're basically setting up for a Spy vs Spy movie, and I am all about that.",

            "content": "We are living in a new age of animation. The first major leap in this process occurred in 1939 when as World War II began to rage Walt Disney introduced the world to the feature-length animated musical movie. One corollary of the advent of computer-generated effects was the use of computers as a tool for animation. Many movie studios quickly create divisions to jump on the bandwagon. For Universal Studios of their successes is a still growing franchise, 'Despicable Me.' Not only do the feature films and shorts continue to entertain family members of all ages. Another milestone of success is the creation of marketable merchandise. This franchise brought out the exceptionally adorable Minions. These little yellow creatures with their unique speech patterns and quirky antics have become a cultural phenomenon. After two films with their master and a solo outing their return to their familiar spot as henchmen in 'Despicable Me 3'. There is a rule that applies to most cinematic franchises, the law of diminishing returns. With each successive installment of a series of movies, each one slightly degraded. It presents an attenuated treatment of the plot and character development. Typically, noticeable the horror genre demonstrates the universality of this statute that it even applies to animated movies. Fans of the movies should be reassured that the decrease in quality is not as precipitous as in most of other types of movies. Even though the move completely comprised an amazing quantity of pixels, the story must continue to follow the standard tropes and archetypes found in live action movies. The first film followed the principal character as he transitioned from an evil genius to a kind-hearted father to a trio of adorable orphan girls. In the sequel Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), continues to solidify his status as a good guy by joining the Anti-Villain League (AVL), and falling in love with one of its agents, Lucy (voiced by Kristen Wiig). In this third outing, the time has arrived for the former evil mastermind to be tempted to abandon his journey on the 'good' side and become tempted to return to his evil ways. The catalyst for this regression is a previously long-lost relative that disrupts Gur's family-oriented stability.\n\nGru is not an active agent for the Anti-Villain League, working alongside his partner and wife, Lucy. They are dispatched around the globe to stop the kind of dastardly plots that he once implemented in his is time as a master villain. Balthazar Bratt (voiced by Trey Parker), is a former child star who has turned to a life of crime now that his time in the celebrity spotlight is over. His latest caper involved stealing the world's largest diamond. Although they foiled the time, they were unable to prevent the fiend from escaping. Recently the head of operations, Silas Ramsbottom (voiced by Steve Coogan) retired and was replaced by the draconian, Valerie Da Vinci (voiced by Jenny Slate (voiced by Jenny Slate), who responds by firing Gru and Lucy. Feeling humiliated Gru has difficulty in telling his girls, Margo (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove, Edith (voiced by Dana Gaier), and little Agnes (voiced by Nev Scharrel), but tries his best to reassure them he will find work soon. When he breaks the news to the Minions most of them leave prompted by Gur's position that no matter how tempting he refuses to return to villainy. Lucy had kept busy since the wedding as an AVL agent but now finds it difficult to be a full-time mother to the girls.\n\nOne morning they are visited by Fritz, the butler of Gur's twin brother Dru (also voiced by Steve Carell). Dru has been living in the far-off country of Freedonia. Gru was unaware of his twin and when questioned his mother (voiced by Julie Andrews) explains that long ago she divorced their father the settlement included they each having custody of one of the twins. Gru takes the family to meet his long-lost twin brother. Once there they discover the family is incredibly wealthy. According to Dru, the fortune was a result f the family business, a pig farm. During this time the Minions are arrested by trespassing on the set of a talent show, and Bratt manages to steal the huge diamond. Typical of and criminal mastermind the theft of the gem is not his true crime. He uses it to power a giant robot that is used to blackmail Hollywood. If they do not revoke the cancellation of his television show, the robot will destroy Hollywood. The use of such obvious plot contrivances rather that attempting put a novel spin on the proceedings is an example of the diminished fresh imagination that went into this installment of the franchise.\n\nAs the newly rejoined brothers catch up Dru reveals to Gru that their late father was one of the world's most infamous supervillain. The source of the family fortune was derived from those illicit proceeds. Dru's inability to succeed in villainy was a source of consternation for their father. Heartbroken, Gru, ever the nice guy, implores Gru to train him in the family business, evil. This sparks a moral dilemma in Gru. Since Lucy and the girls Gru have worked extremely hard to change his ways and are reticent to revert. Meanwhile, Lucy his trying to fill her parental responsibilities by rebuffing Nico (voiced by Adrian Ciscato), a boy who has shown an interest in Margo. This brings up an interesting aspect of the story, the franchise itself. The animated characters are afforded the opportunity to age and grow emotionally. This is reflected in the moral redemption effected by Gru. While some of this emotional depth may go undetected by the younger, target demographic, the nuances imparted into the story does make it more interesting to the adults in the audience. A mirthful balance is achieved as Agnes and Edith become involved with a hunt for a unicorn.\n\nUltimately, Dru convinces Gru to join him in a major crime, steal the diamond. Gru agrees but with an ulterior motive. Gru intends to turn the purloined gem over to the AVL forcing Da Vinci to rehire him and his wife. The ensuing mayhem draws the brothers, Lucy, the Minions and even Bratt together for the rousing dénouement. The film is the first animated feature of the franchise that was presented in the aspect ratio of 2.39:1. This does enhance the 3D effects helping to maximize the illusion of depth for the best possible use. The previous outings had the Minions had some meta based fun spoofing the usual 3d contrivances. While not as involved as before there is sufficient playing with the technology and how badly some filmmakers are in its use. Admittedly it is a decline from the previous movies but still well worthwhile. Unfortunately, the 3D version is only available in Region B, Britain and Europe. Multi region players capable of handling 3D are readily available for less than $100 including Streaming services and DLNA capabilities. Considering this is happing at an increasing rate if you plan on extending your 3D library this type of player is a must.\nbullet\tMini-Movie: The Secret Life of Kyle\nbullet\tMinion Moments\nbullet\tDeleted Scenes\nbullet\tCharacter Profiles",

SO SAD WTF?! And like yeah I feel asleep 30 minutes in but man we're those 30 minutes a roller coaster. There's an action sequence, Gru gets fired, there's a twin brother twist, Gru plans a heist to steal the diamond back while encouraging his brothers evil tendencies.

However, these are just small flaws and  are easy to look past once you see the plots mesh together in a really satisfying way. This movie had some pretty good highlights, like when Gru said his mother told him that his father died of disappointment when he was born as well. Overall, Despicable Me 3 is an extremely enjoyable ride I'd recommend to anyone who can get past its flaws. This movie gets a 9.5/10.",

While it may turn off some as a cheap trick, or because they think their favourite character hasn't gotten enough screen time (or barely any at all), I think it's a good direction.

            "content": "I've made my feelings on Illumination  Entertainment known throughout the years that I've had the (dis)pleasure of reviewing their films throughout the years.  I even went so far as to state, in my review of Sing, that I felt they were the worst major animation studio since, in my opinion, they hadn't produced ONE good movie yet.  Of course, Sing changed all that and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  But I'm not about to sit here and say that it was a masterpiece of CG films.  It was just a fun little diversion, but it offered nothing of substance.  In fact, you could say their entire filmography has been all style and no substance.  Having said all that, I still feel that Illumination is still the worst major animation studio in North America.  Their first major franchise, Despicable Me, gave way to the asinine and insufferable merchandising bonanza that are the Minions.  Perhaps you could call it a stroke of marketing genius that they managed to make these little annoying assholes into THE biggest mascot any film company has had in quite a while, but I think they just lucked into it honestly.  While I get that their intentions, for the original DM, were probably always to merchandise the Minions, I don't imagine that they thought it would take off the way it did.  Minions are still popular to this day and I just don't understand it.  The Minions are so popular that if you were to ask a casual fan to name any other character from the Despicable Me franchise that isn't Gru, 99% would fail.  I'd fail at that challenge, but I have NEVER been a fan of the franchise anyway.  The point is that the Minions are bigger than any of the characters in the movie and this franchise continues to exist, to this day, because it's relatively cheap to produce compared to Pixar's output (no Illumination Entertainment film has cost more than $80 million to produce) and they make a ton of money.  But, and more importantly than that, they serve to justify EVEN MORE MINIONS MERCHANDISE.  The Despicable Me franchise exists to peddle more of this bullshit, that's the only reason they keep being made.  They're gonna squeeze that cash cow until it cannot give anymore.  Cynical movie made for cynical purposes.  Perhaps my issues with the franchise start with the original movie, where some people actually said it had Pixar-esque storytelling and I found that a laughable concept upon actually having seen the movie.  The only interesting character, to me, was Gru's mother in how she really was the only villainous character in the entire film and, therefore, the only entertaining one.  Of course, what do you do with the most interesting character from the first movie when you head into a sequel?  You get rid of her entirely.  What do you do with that character in the SECOND sequel?  You only have her in ONE measly scene.  Do these people even know what they're doing?  No, I don't think they do.  Let's move on to the actual movie, shall we?  I don't know, having said all that I have said and all of my complaints about the franchise and Illumination in general, I found this to be the most \"entertaining\" of all the Despicable Me movies.  I realize that that might not be saying much, since I'm giving this the same score as the two movies that preceded it.  What I can say is that, thankfully, this is better than that insufferable Minions spin-off movie.  But, and again, this is an Illumination legacy issue, their movies have always been more about the style than any real actual substance.  There's no depth to any of their movies and I'll slap you silly if anyone dare say otherwise.  I really don't remember any of the previous movies, probably for good reason, this one feels as inconsistent as ever.   The main problem is, of course, the scripting.  This is like a series of subplots all cobbled together to barely make a 'narrative'.  Gru meets his brother, Dru and they spend a lot of the time together bonding and doing their own shit.  The Minions quit after Gru gets fired from the Anti-Villain League and he refuses to return to a life of villainy.  They go off on their journey that sees them perform at one of those singing competitions, they get thrown in jail and then they escape from it at a later point in the film, when they realize they love Gru.  Lucy struggles to connect with the girls.  Agnes, the smallest and most annoying of the girls, tries to find an unicorn.  And then there's Balthazar Bratt.  While I liked the addition of Dru, I felt that Balthazar Bratt was a cool little addition to the franchise that they really didn't do much with.  Balthazar, a former 80s child star, has been stuck in a state of arrested development, still dressing and fashioning his life as if it was the 80s, when his show got cancelled as a result of his puberty.  Sometimes, when movies introduce 80s elements, it feels like an excuse to license some cool 80s music or to be nostalgic.  But Bratt still living in the past is actually essential to the character and I find that it works.  Though, to be fair, it still feels like an excuse to license 80s music and have an 80s aesthetic in the movie with the colorful costumes, the neon, the fashion, etc, etc.  It's just more justified given Bratt's past.  The film really doesn't have any clever or inspiring writing and the fact that they rely so much on slapstick is disappointing.  Not that you can't use it, but you need to mix and match things, it can't always be the same thing over and over and over again.  And that's just what this movie feels like.  It's not that it's all slapstick, but the humor is definitely very repetitive.  And, as the RT consensus says, it is a very scattershot movie as it relates to its humor.  And I thought that this was still the most entertaining of all the films in the franchise.  I wonder what that says about previous installments.  The animation is colorful enough for the children, but I've never felt that Illumination has been a studio that you can count on to deliver the goods as it relates to truly high-quality and detailed worlds that would rival the best in the business.  And I guess they realize that they'll never be as good as Pixar is in terms of creating beautiful worlds and they work to avoid the comparisons.  They stick to what they know and rarely ever stray from their comfort zone.  Having said that, though, their style of animation, as much as their approach to their stories, has always been very shallow.  I wish I could rant on the same level that I used to in the past with regards to this franchise, but I'm just not feeling it anymore.  Of course, I'm still not a fan and large parts of this are just really lazy filmmaking, but I never felt there was anything inherently wrong with this movie as there was with the first two or even the Minions' spin-off.  Yes, they still get the same score, but they annoyed me more than this one did.  I don't know whether that's just the fact that I turned 30 two months ago and I don't have the same vitriol inside me anymore?  That's a lie, if a movie pisses me off, I can still release the kraken, as it were.  I just think that, at this point, I'm finally over the whole Despicable Me franchise.  I'll watch them if I find them easily available to me, but I'm sort of over the entire thing.  The Minions are what they are and they will continue to be the main focus of this franchise's promotion, no matter what I say.  They're doing what they need to do for their business, I'm just some nerd on the internet.  I don't like it, but it is what it is.  The franchise is still forgettable and this movie, while decent enough, doesn't change the trend.  It's safe, sanitized.  It's something your kids, if you have any, will watch, enjoy and then forget about it a few hours later.  It's mindless entertainment.  There's no risk.  Even without taking those risks, Illumination has still reaped the rewards, sadly.  It has taught them that it's ok to not put in much of an effort with their narratives, as long as they have cute, colorful and marketable characters.  The rest will sort itself out in time.  And I don't wanna say that Illumination has untalented artists, because that would not be the case, I'm sure there's a lot of really talented people working really hard to put a movie like this together, I just feel that the focus from the higher-ups, whom the artists take orders from, is on something else entirely as opposed to making sure that you have a high-quality movie on your hands.  If they wanted to produce high-quality movies, I'm sure they could.  But there's a reason why so many of their films fall flat on their faces creatively and that's because they know that, regardless of whether or not this movie was any good, it's still gonna make a shit-ton of money.  That assessment would be correct, but it's a cynical way to look at this business.  Because it's one that values the money over the creativity.  And, again, any business needs to make money, but there's no reason, if you're an animated studio, that you can't mix the two.  Pixar has achieved this for over TWENTY years and DreamWorks, at times, has also accomplished this.  Why can't Illumination???  Maybe they just don't want to, who knows???  I'm not gonna speculate, even though I pretty much already did.  Anyway.  This is another Despicable Me movie, take it or leave it, it's the same as you've seen before with some new, slightly entertaining additions.  Decent, but I won't remember anything about this in a week, maybe less.",

I have Minion characters on my checks from Costco and my address return labels. I have a couple of large minion dolls that guard the dryer in the laundry room. I am not a middle-aged woman who drinks too much red wine, however, for me the Minions spark joy. When the minions are on the screen their antics are the funniest thing around (The jail bit in this film is downright inspired and almost saves the whole movie.)\n\nAlso a special kudos for the cutest \"unicorn\" I have ever seen on film (Take note The Last Unicorn). In fact, the entire film is cute, colorful and very kid friendly. (The main bad guy's superweapon is expanding bubblegum.)\n\nThe Bad: Let's start with a quote from the first Despicable Me...\n[Sees Edith near his iron maiden]\nGru: No, no! Stay away from there! It's fragile!\n[the iron maiden closes with Edith inside; a red liquid leaks from underneath; Margo and Agnes gasp]\nGru: Well, I suppose the plan will work with two.\n\nI missed this Gru in Despicable Me 2 and he is long gone in Despicable Me 3. Gru simply works better as a despicable villain with an occasional soft spot rather than a big softy who only does villain stuff because that is what is on his CV and the mortgage is due.\n\nThere are also too many subplots in the film. The Minions are spun off for most of the flick, so their scenes cannot do double duty for the rest of the plot. Obvious jokes that the writers initially would have had (The villain is stealing the Pink Panther after all) were clearly cut for time. It leads to a choppy, meanwhile in another movie, vibe.\n\nIn conclusion: This is the weakest of the Despicable Me films (Yes weaker than even The Minions movie). It also made over one billion dollars. This is not even including the ridiculous monies the merchandising made. Needless to say, we should look forward to many more efforts down the line.",

Now watch your kids swallow yellow turds every two years!\nDESPICABLE ME 3\nYou know what you're buying, the trailer is quite open about it. Steve Carell times two, Minions times a thousand and Agnes wanting a unicorn times 1. If it an't broke, don't fix it, right? But do you know what soap operas do when they run out of ideas but still have to keep going because... money...? They introduce an evil twin into the mix! It's a common trope of series that have run out of ideas. Now, that seems to be recurrent in this year's sequels (notable exception to John Wick 2) and this movie is one of the most blatant examples. There's absolutely nothing new in this sequel, not an ounce of movie that I haven't seen in the previous movies or in the animation genre. But a goldmine is goldmine and this one is glows in yellow so... keep digging. Not to say that this film is bad, it has a grand introduction and some very well accomplished action scenes. It also has a smart soundtrack and good (yet formulaic) pace. But what's new? it has been 4 days since I have watched this film and I remember the second and even the first one more vividly. That speaks highly of this film's. It's so passable that you watch it and... that's it. You may take your kids to McDonald's to buy a chunk of diabetes mixed with a piece of minion merchandise, but apart from that, there's not much to do. Illumination has been very mediocre with its new expansion and later offerings and this movie just rides the tide. It will make incomprehensible amounts of money regardless of this mediocreness, it won't get nominated for an Oscar this time because of how childish it is, but that isn't what the movie was made for. The Minions is strong proof of this Hollywood mantra of entertainment over substance and this film, though not as bad, is just a continuation. It's an incoherent, unfocused sugar rush but at least it's short!",

But when a mysterious stranger shows up to inform Gru that he has a long-lost twin brother - a brother who desperately wishes to follow in his twin's despicable footsteps - one former super-villain will rediscover just how good it feels to be bad.\n\nReview:\nI was quite a big fan of the first couple of movies in this franchise, and I enjoyed the Minions movie but this 3rd film didn't really do it for me. The jokes were a bit weak and the I wasn't that impressed with the new characters. The storyline also seemed rushed and slightly messy, and I missed the original Gru (Steve Carell), who was witty and much funnier as the master criminal. Anyway, in this film Gru and his girlfriend, Lucy (Kristen Wiig), are fired from the AVL agency, because they failed to takedown Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), while he was stealing the largest diamond in the world, even though they managed to save the diamond from the rich super villain. Balthazar used to be a child star, with a hit show on TV but when his show is cancelled, he seeks revenge by destroying Hollywood, with the power of the precious diamond. Now that Gru and Lucy are jobless, and the Minions leave the household because they are bored of living a life away from crime, Lucy tries to get close to the kids, even though she finds it hard playing mummy. Gru then receives a message that he has a brother, so he takes the kids and Lucy to visits his twin. Although Gru and his new found brother, Dru, are complete opposites, they both have an interest in crime, due to there deceased father, so they join forces to take down Balthazar, who manages to steal back the biggest diamond in the world from the agency. While they are dodging all of Balthazar's hidden traps, the brothers bond together, and the Minions come back to help them fight against the dangerous criminal. There are a few touching moments with the kids, and the Minions did make me chuckle but apart from that, I much preferred the previous movies. There wasn't any memorable moments through the whole movie, and the original cast didn't seem to progress from the second film. Anyway, it's worth a watch if your a fan of the previous movies but its not the type of film that I will watch again. That's not to say that it was a total let down, but from an adults point of view, it could have been much better. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Kyle Balda, 46, who also brought you The Lorax and the Minions movie. It was also directed by Pierre Coffin, 50, who brought you the original Despicable Me and he also directed the original Minions, so it's obvious that this project must have been close to there hearts. With a 4th movie on the cards, it will be good to see how the crazy bunch progress, now that Gru has found his long lost brother, and Balthazar is still at large. I just hope that the writers bring back some of the old humour, which made the franchise so popular in the first place. Although I wasn't a massive fan of this film, it has been the biggest earner in the franchise, and its the 25th biggest movie of all time, beating Jurassic Park believe it or not, so it's not surprising that they are working on a 4th movie.\n\nBudget: $80million\nWorldwide Gross: $1.04billion\n\nGenre: Animation, Action, Adventure\nCast: Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Trey Parker, Miranda Cosgrove, Steve Coogan, Julie Andrews and Jenny Slate. 4/10",

That's the truth. They had less screenspace which directly affected the film and those who love them.\n\nGru is set to meet his twin brother, Dru, who is dreaming to be like his father, a supervillain. But now changed Gru is not interested to help his brother. Instead, he uses him to accomplish on what he had failed recently. Okayish story, but it had some good fun. It's almost given a hint about the possible plot for the next sequel. I think kids would enjoy it without expecting much. So a one time watchable film.\n\n6/10",

The animation editing is clean and very well-pasted of the series of sequences with great angle panning of focus, characters like the minions had become less contributed to the whole plot of the film we just get to see them playing around with less interaction this time and even less screen time and in the final battle they're just there. Antagonist like Brat was a formidable against Gru and his forces but there was no direct or logical reasoning to why he even should destroy Hollywood aside for fun?. Lastly is the final battle, it was a good idea that the writers ended the film in a new different way like the dance fight but if you overlook the sequences of the fight it doesn't seem challenging  between Gru and Brat, sure it' had a plenty enough of screen time and appealing enough to audience but no full extent of potential of the fighters. The story itself is very understandable, relatable and inspiring considering it's all in tie to Gru's reunited family, it gives a valuable lesson of Self-worth but the plot is pretty much the same as every superheroe film, save the day, save the dream, save the world cliche to it, other than that I had a good experience with this film",

So this is about... well, a lot of different things, but per IMDb, the main plot is Gru being reunited with his long lost twin brother Dru (both voiced by Steve Carell).  As you may remember, Gru has gone clean and gotten out of crime, but his brother wants to pull him back in for one last heist.  Now I will say that I genuinely like the first Despicable Me.  It was an out of nowhere surprise from an animation studio that had yet to make its mark, and it was just feel-good family fun.  Every returning installment/spin-off has not been as inspired, and it hasn't even been close.  I wouldn't even go so far as to call it lazy, it's more like they just run with the first idea that comes to mind, and that is most present with Despicable Me 3.  I do believe that there has been a conundrum that has been reached: these movies are making money hand over fist, so much so that it is actually staggering if you sit down and crunch the numbers ($3.7 billion worldwide in ticket sales, and that is not a typo).  I am a firm believer that originality should be rewarded, and everybody involved does deserve kickbacks for the first movie that they crafted.  As time has gone on, they've essentially cornered a market with no quality control and made a series that is critic-proof.  I do think that there is going to be a big drop off sometime really soon, because they've been phoning in these \"stories\" for three movies now if you include Minions.  Despicable Me 3 isn't really a movie, it is about 9 subplots that are weaved together, and they seldom intersect.  I mean seriously, it reached a point where I was forgetting story threads because there is just that much juggling.  It would be fine if there was 3 or 4 subplots and an actual main story line, but there isn't one that gets more screen time over another, and given that there is no standout for being interesting, it ends up being a hard movie to care about.  I know it sounds like I am coming down hard on this, but I don't actually hate this.  It's well-animated and the best in series in that department, and some of the jokes actually hit from time to time.  Much like the latest Pirates movie, I still got some entertainment value out of it, even though I do think it is a series that has run its course and is just spinning its wheels at this point.  Despicable Me 3 is watchable, but there's no reason to get excited over it.  When they inevitable release a sequel movie in the next two years, I hope they actually figure out a direction to take this series in, but I'm not getting my hopes up.",

            "content": "It had taken me a while to finally view this third installment in the Despicable Me franchise because Minions more than gave me fatigue. I loved the original film and even enjoyed the second one quite a bit, but Minions was honestly the worst possible thing they could've done for this franchise. Sadly, I had lost all hope until I found myself chuckling throughout the trailers for Despicable Me 3, but I've never been more wrong. Although these movies continue to make loads of cash, the quality seems to progressively get worse. The uniqueness of this franchise has officially been thrown out the window. Yes, these movies will continue getting made due to money, but if this installment is any indication, quality is clearly not what matters to them anymore.\n\nFollowing Gru after he has proven himself to be a great father and a great man in general, he and his new lover work for an organization that brings down villains. As a new villain is on the horizon in Balthazar Bratt, Gru must do everything in his power to take him down. Adding in a layer of family, he also discovers that he has a brother who shares his original need to be a villain. Combining all of these story elements pretty much sends this film into an endless repetition, providing the same character arcs that the first two films already offered. This film is a jumbled mess in terms of doing anything new with its characters and when it comes down to it, it's just not all that funny either.\n\nThe clever slapstick humor of the first two films is truly what made them so enjoyable and while this movie definitely attempts to recapture that magic, the slapstick just comes off as forced and the childish humor is cranked up to a thousand. I found this movie to be much more for children than the previous films were. The meshing of adult humor worked very well and could play well for a much broader audience. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments here, but they're too few and far between. Sadly though, aside from a few solid jokes, the only great thing about this film is the animation.\n\nMany animated films can be called great in terms of how they look, but that's not enough to warrant praise as a whole. Despicable Me 3 is beautifully animated as always and the journey the film takes you on is fun enough to experience once, but I'm finding myself remembering everything that happened throughout this film with ease because it was so incredibly predictable. I have no desire to ever revisit this installment. Quite frankly, I can't even begin to describe my disappointment with this film in comparison with its predecessors.\n\nIn conclusion, this movie may be a fine watch for young kids, but I won't ever find myself recommending this film to anyone over the age of ten, because the humor is just too juvenile, unlike the jokes that made the first two so memorable. It's not like this is one of the worst animated movies I've ever seen, but when I find myself laughing at one or two jokes throughout a 90-minute film, in which its predecessors had me chuckling consistently, then there's a big issue.\n\nDespicable Me 3 has great voice talents as always, but none of them are utilized to their full potential this time around, especially with the addition of the very funny Trey Parker. I thought his character was going to be far more enjoyable than just another average villain, but his tropes got tired pretty quick. Overall, this movie fails to provide anything new for the franchise and therefore sort of kills any future excitement I would've wished to have for the coming films. Maybe Minions 2 will turn that around? I doubt it...",

There's a lot of sideplots which I think if they were given more time with them they would be more tolerable but because this movie doesn't spend much time developing any of it's new ideas all the side plots feel pretty boring. The comedy is pretty solid and the characters are likable (With the exception of grus kids, they feel really pandering and annoying.) Despicable Me 3 is an enjoyable film, even though it suffers from too many side plots and sometimes characters can be annoying. In the end, its ok.",

            "content": "As far as disposable sequels to kids films, Despicable Me 3 is pretty much on par with Cars 3 (2017). It's not a particularly memorable film nor can it really hold its own against something like The LEGO Batman Movie (2017) but at least it's not unpleasant. In-fact in may ways Despicable Me 3 is better than the original in that it improves its look-and-feel and provides a decent foil for once in the form of Trey Parker's Balthazar Bratt. Of course it's to the detriment of neutering the refreshing mean-spirited-ness of the original, but hey, at least you still got those Minions am I right? Despicable Me 3 catches Gru (Carell) and newly minted wife Lucy (Wiig) trying and failing to secure the world's largest diamond from the hands of Bratt our flamboyant 80's themed villain. Fired by the new head of the Anti-Villain League (Slate), Gru and Lucy discover he has a twin brother named Dru (also Carell) whom their parents separated at birth. With nothing on their plate, Gru, Lucy and the girls (Cosgrove, Gaier and Scharrel), travel to the Mediterranean coasts of Freedonia to meet Dru.\n\nWhen the family lands in Freedonia, the movie descends into a series of fun but thematically incongruous vignettes. Gru bonds with his brother over Dru's desire to become a villain, Lucy fails, succeeds and fails again to become a mother figure to the three girls, Agnes, the youngest of the three tries to capture a unicorn, Balthazar Bratt sees his plans for world domination come to near-fruition and the Minions...well let's just say they have their own thing going as well.\n\nAbout half of all this busy, busy, business works at least as far as furthering the plot. The fact that none of the film's insanity really coalesces into a compelling whole, only makes the film feel more like a mediocre sitcom episode than an actual movie. Yet as far as inspired moments of slapstick, Despicable Me 3 supplies a little bit more than is to be expected. One highlight involves Gru and Dru driving around the Freedonian countryside in a golden-plated mean machine while police follow while riding literal pigs. Parents will find these comedic bits more amusing than funny but the kids, the kids will be rolling up and down the aisles.\n\nAnd isn't that what this movie is ultimately about? To provide entertainment to children? While I don't necessarily condone families watching kid's films for their own sake (and this one in particular is all over the map as far as messaging), there's not really all that much to object about here. Despicable Me 3 is at its core a thoughtless but entertaining jumble of sights, sounds and goofiness. Thankfully unlike your racist aunt, Illumination Entertainment has not used the Minions for nefarious purposes...at least not yet.nce again, Steve Carell proves he's better at doing CGI voice-overs than he is at live-action comedy.\n\nThe movie begins with a retrospective news story about Balthazar Bratt; an ex-child TV star gone bad (Holy Danny Partridge, Batman!). Followed by the super-villainous, middle-aged version going after the world's biggest diamond in the modern day. When Gru and Lucy fail to capture him, however, it turns out that this is the _third_ such disastrous confrontation.\n\nResult; termination of employment with extreme (though non-lethal) prejudice.\n\nThe rest of the film is like a cross between Disney's THE INCREDIBLES and the Ah-nuld/Devito comedy TWINS. Carell does an admittedly good job making Drew appear to be a more naive/less competent version of Old Gru (the villainous one from the first film) simply by using a shriller voice combined with wavy-blond CGI hair! So, who better to help him overcome that handicap than his long-lost brother who once stole the Moon, itself?\n\nSpeaking of shrill voices; once again, the Minions are voiced--at higher RPM's--by French executive producer Pierre Coffin. Although, the sub-plot about their going to prison for loitering and trespassing wasn't as hilarious as it could have been, I still got a kick out of the French version of that old Gilbert and Sullivan classic, \"The Modern Major General.\"\n\nI also loved Julie Andrews' cameo \"appearance\" as the voice of Gru's mother (now a cougar-ish dowager). Priceless!\n\nBut, of course, what really stole the show (as in the first two films) was the lovability of Little Agnes. This time, on the hunt for a \"really live unicorn.\"\n\nAdd all of the above--plus some STAR WARS and Marx Brothers references-- to a toe-tapping, finger-snapping, head-bobbing sound track from the Eighties (back when MTV actually lived up to the name \"Music Television\") and you've got another winner from Sony/Illumination.\n\nWas the above review useful to you?",

I have this on par with the minion film which was also a very empty film. This could be the beginning of the end of the franchise, look at Shrek or even the Ice Age franchises for the downward spiral. I hope they improve the film series but I don't see where they could take this franchise. Hollywood is full of dying franchises and I thought they could do better with this series but sadly it's a shame here. 19-11-2017.",

This time, the opposition is former child star Balthazar Bratt, stranded deep in the 1980s, who takes out frustrations about an ancient sitcom cancellation on jewel owners and Hollywood big-spenders alike. Played with energy by Trey Parker and swathed in a dense cloak of pop culture references, Bratt brings a fresh new dynamic to the franchise that gives this third installment just enough of a boost to feel necessary. Most of those cultural winks were completely lost on my kids, of course, but they still appreciated his silly wardrobe, fly dance-fighting moves and crafty arsenal of unlikely weapons. There's a side story with Gru's forgotten twin brother Dru (both played by Steve Carell, of course), and a sweet arc that finds Kristin Wiig's special agent Lucy seeking a relationship with the reformed villain's three girls, but those feel like slight retreads and don't have the new criminal's panache. Clearly, Illumination was having a good time with Bratt, while the other plot threads were more like obligations. It's fun, with some great bits of physical comedy and a necessary return to the heartstring-plucking of the first film, though overall it lands in somewhat shallow waters. An improvement over the underachieving Despicable Me 2, if not quite up to the original's snuff.",

            "content": "If you are considering Despicable Me 3...\n\tAssigned as a group project from our English Professor, my two group mates and I were given the task of picking any movie, new release or old, to review.  Being the uber-creative group we are, the first movie to pop up using the search, \"new movies\", was Despicable Me 3. Expectations were not set high, however, to our surprise, it happened to be an entertaining and well put together movie. Not as great as the first Despicable Me, but definitely worth our time and we would love to tell you why! There is a lot to cover when it comes to reviewing Despicable Me 3, so we will break this into chunks.\n First, Despicable Me 3 is an enjoyable movie because the animation looks real enough to make any person think that wherever these characters could be a real place. For example, my father, a 62 year old man,  is blown away every time he sees a Despicable Me movie or anything with the Universal Pictures animation. Your children, grand children, or any child that is able to watch this movie will find it realistic and hilarious. It will make them laugh due to the funny character animations like Gru's long, pointy nose, and tiny body, or the angry dog that looks a little more like a wild animal that is always out to mess with the other characters. Despicable Me 3 will not just make the kids laugh either, but it is sure to make everyone watching laugh or enjoy it at some point. All of the Despicable Me movies have had massive budgets with almost identical animation. Despicable Me with 69 million, Despicable Me 2 with 76 million, and the big one, Despicable Me 3 with 80 million. Universal Pictures doesn't skimp when it comes to putting a lot of money into a film to make it something special. With big names like Jurassic Park, Jaws, Back to The Future, King Kong, and dozens of other recognizable titles, Universal doesn't disappoint and Despicable Me was no exception.\nSecond, Despicable Me 3 is an enjoyable movie because it mainly focuses on characters' development and interactions between them. For example, the main protagonist, Gru, a character that is having a hard time adjusting to his life as being a hero and he finds out that he has an evil twin brother named Dru. Even though they found each other, they both has their differing opinions on how to be a hero or villain, but ended up having an awesome bond throughout the movie.  Also, Lucy, Gru's wife, is another great example of the level of character's development that is shown in the Despicable Me series. Lucy is trying her best to be a mother figure to the adopted girls; Agnes, Edith and Margo. For example, while the family is going on a trip to Gru's twin brother's place, Lucy implements some family activities. However she tries her best, it does not go well. Moreover, the Minions are other character's development example. They want Gru to be an evil villain again, but Gru threw the life of villain away and became an hero which made the Minions mad and leave gru, and at the end, they missed him. Furthermore, Gru himself has problem with adjusting to his career. Gru was once a villain enjoying his career of robbing and stealing from people. When Lucy came into his life, he became a hero. The final character's development is Bratt, the antagonist, in the movie he wanted to be famous star. Bratt was an actor and wanted the frame, but he was fired. So, he got mad and became villain. All of these characters; Lucy, Gru, Dru, Bratt, and the Minions, develop into memorable characters throughout the entirety of the Despicable Me series.\nThird, Despicable Me 3 is an enjoyable movie because it could be considered a family movie.  So, anyone can watch it with the family without any fears. For example, the movie is clear of sex and nudity, so it does not contain any sexual scene, word, or indication which makes it comfortable for you and your kids to watch together.  Also, it is clear of profanity, so during watching the movie you will not be annoyed by any bad words which leads you to concentrate on the movie events. Moreover, this movie is clear of any violence, gore, killing, or blood scenes, so your kids will not learn any negative behaviors.  The most interesting reason, it is a cartoon movie which gives the kids more happiness and interest. The most emotional reason is the family interactions between the agent Gru and his new found twin brother, Dru. Also, between girls, Gru, and Lucy, and how Lucy could become a mother for the girls. The family's interactions make the movie a source of lessons about family relations and bonds.  Finally, the movie's ending is an excellent because it gives a positive impact for every member of the family. Therefore, Despicable Me 3 is suitable for a family's weekend movie night.\nIn conclusion, Despicable Me 3 is a good movie and worths the time and money which you will spend to watch it with your family. This movie has a fantastic animation which seems as the real movie. Also, the movie has a deep level of character development, making you feel like you know the characters well.  Moreover, it is suitable to be watched by all family members and learn about family bonds.  Therefore, you can take your family to watch Despicable Me 3 and you will enjoy your time and popcorn.",

            "content": "Just when you thought they couldn't milk this franchise any further, we get a trilogy, as if it was obligatory (I actually think it is).\n\nI have never understood why this franchise was even remotely popular. The first movie was reasonably passable capitalising on the now exhausted superhero genre. An evil super genius getting long in the tooth tries to remain relevant amongst the growing number of younger supervillains. And in the end the supervillain becomes the hero. Then came the sequel which simply went straight down the old supervillain versus superhero route. The supervillain from the first movie now essentially a superhero fighting crime. Now along comes the third movie which is clearly struggling for ideas.\n\nIt now turns out that old Gru (Steve Carell) has a long lost brother called Dru (ugh!!). Dru of course looks identical to Gru except he has hair, he is also voiced by Carell. Dru is a budding supervillain and dreams of working with his infamous super genius brother. Problem is Gru is now a superhero and can't find a way to break this to his brother. So in the long run Gru ends up tricking Dru into helping him take down a problematic supervillain called Balthazar Brat (Trey Parker). Gru does this by pretending they are actually carrying out an evil plan. But anyway, yes they drag up the old long lost relation plot angle to keep this nonsense going. I really don't need to explain how lame this is do I?\n\nRight so we already know Gru, his wife Lucy and their kids. So what about Dru, what's he like? Well like I said he looks identical to Gru, except for his flowing blonde hair. His voice is fairly similar to Gru's because he's voiced by Carell, oh and he dresses in white...to counter Gru's black. So yeah...that's about as imaginative as it gets for that. But wait! There is actually a positive note here, and that's the new evil character of Balthazar Brat. This is mainly down to two simple reasons. Firstly he's voiced by Trey Parker who has that simple, yet amusing tone of voice that we all know and love from [i]South Park[/i]. Really hard to pinpoint why his voice is so catchy because its generally pretty normal. I think its Parker's ability to sound so satirical and mocking in a relatively deadpan manner.\n\nSecondly its because the character of Balthazar is stuck in the 80's. He's obsessed with the 80's, anything and everything to do with that era. Being an 80's gen bloke this of course appealed to me greatly and I enjoyed the various pop culture references. Admittedly most of the references, quips and visual gags weren't anything overly original. He dances to various classic 80's pop songs while he works and plays with various 80's toys and gadgets. He dresses in typical 80's fashions, he has a mullet, and his evil plan involves a giant robot or mech rampaging through Hollywood (in typical [i]Godzilla[/i] or 80's Saturday morning cartoon type fashion). So whilst this character was indeed a totally unoriginal idea, for me he was fun to watch. Not overly sure how kids these days would quite get him though. I would of thought most of the references would go sailing over their heads.\n\nIndeed its only when Balthazar is on the screen this movie is any fun. Most of the movie is filled with mind-numbing crapola showing Gru looking after his insufferable kids. Like the sub plot involving one of his daughters trying to find a unicorn...eh? Or the other daughter and her potential boyfriend...ugh! Or spending time with his brother and his supervillain inventions (like we haven't seen that kind of stuff before). As for the minions, hell they've been relegated to a sub plot also. You don't actually get that much minion screen time a tall really because they leave Gru after he refuses to return to villainy. Of course they return for the finale but overall they're in and out of the picture. Odd because I thought they were a cash cow.\n\nI dunno, I just didn't get the point of this movie because it literally offered nothing new. Even the bad guy, who was enjoyable, was completely unoriginal in every aspect. Yes the movie looks great as all CGI animated movies do nowadays, so that's kinda inconsequential at the end of the day. The soundtrack is the usual god awful collection of hip-hop and rap which every kids movie has to incorporate it seems. Its not particularly funny and its not particularly exciting. The entire feature simply feels like a by the numbers production merely chugged out to try and squeeze the last few drops of money out before it inevitably dies. Well its dead alright.",

            "content": "Honestly, kind of insulting. Illumination has so much opportunity to make great films, with big budgets, and real meaning. Unfortunately, they have found out what the recipe for a popular animated movie is, and when they created minions, they struck gold. They never innovate, just replicate. They use the same overused animated movie tropes, like they always have. Despicable Me was charming, and fun. Despicable Me 2 was lazy, poorly written, and annoyingly obvious. Minions was awful. I have already reviewed it, so I won't here. Despicable Me 3's slogan, (Oh brother.) was my prompt reaction as the movie began. The writing is bad, the themes are overplayed and lazy, and the plot never really went anywhere. There wasn't any way to tell where the movie was, because the 2nd act is so long and vague. I honestly didn't know when the movie was ending, and none of the side-plots connected very well. Nothing about this movie made me laugh. Interestingly, the audiences have seemingly started to get sick of the series. I watched it with a friend in theaters on release day, the first showing, and the 13 other people in the audience never laughed. I heard a couple of chuckles, but no one was really enjoying themselves. The ratings on RottenTomatoes are pleasantly low, and it's reassuring that people likely won't bankroll any more films. This movie cashes out on lazy gags. The animation hasn't changed or improved noticeably in 7 YEARS! Illumination uses the laziest, cheapest, easiest animation they can do. It is colorful and pleasant, which is one of the only positive things that made me sit through this movie. The voice acting by Steve Carrel is fine, like the other movies. The side plots go nowhere, and have minimal or no impact on the main story's events. I was puzzled when the movie finished, because it left a lot unresolved.",

Proceedings are anchored spectacularly once again by the always reliable Steve Carrell as Gru (whilst also playing the excellent Dru) but it's the arrival of nemesis Balthazar Bratt that provides much of the best moments of the film.\nHis outlandish,fiendish and largely comical antics coupled with an excellent accompanying 80's soundtrack (to keep the older kids happy no doubt!) are the fuel that drive this ninety minutes of fun and make this a welcome addition to the series.\nOverall, a busy film filled with fun, frolics and foolishness that will please fans of the franchise and family members of all ages! Good fun!",

I disliked the second film, largely due to its unsatisfactory story, forced sentimentality and the pushing of the Minions into the foreground. In the first film they essentially had a string of admittedly funny cameo appearances without overstaying their welcome, but have lately been given entire subplots, completely overexposing them and making the audience seriously question whether or not they were even that funny in the first place. The central storyline here is just as bad as the last one, if not worse. The whole thing is so limp and uninvolving that the when the credits roll it's hard to believe you've spent the last hour and a half watching a feature film. The characters are barely developed, the humour relies heavily on stupid slapstick and toilet humour, and the soundtrack would suggest that the filmmakers have an even bigger 80s nostalgia boner than Adam Sandler ever had. It got a chuckle out of me from time to time, but it has no reason to exist, and the franchise as a whole has no reason to continue. But as long as the Minions can be printed on t-shirts, towels and lunchboxes, we'll likely never see the end of them.",

Steve Carell and Kristen Wigg were great as Gru and Lucy. The acting wasnt the problem. It was just the very mediocre pacing that really pulled this one down. The subplot with Gru having a long lost brother Dru, also voiced by Steve Carell, was unnecessary. After the first 10-15 minutes of the film, the rest is boring, and just didnt feel like Despicable Me.

The minions have really lost their charm and overall usefulness, though they are back to being side characters (thankfully), they add nothing to the film by being there. It's so busy shoe-horning in its bad humor, that it forgets to add any emotion. The relationship between Gru, Lucy, and their kids provide the most quality scenes, but those are sparse, and short in duration. The new characters have clear motivation, but they're not fully fleshed out so we are left with no reason to care about them. And on top of all that, it's predictable.

            "content": "Just when you thought they ran out of ideas, Despicable Me 3 hits the cinemas and it, unsurprisingly, really isn't good. The story follows Gru, Lucy and their three adopted daughters. Gru and Lucy are now both secret agents on a mission to stop a villain called Evil Bratt who wants to steal a huge pink diamond (obviously a \"Pink Panther\" refference). Unfortunately for them, they both get fired after failing to capture him and are now looking for a job. Meanwhile, Gru finds out he has a twin brother, Dru, and goes with his family to reunite with him. That's generally the entire story. It's nothing we haven't seen before, but if there's one thing that's good about it, it's Trey Parker voicing Evil Bratt. Trey Parker is an amazing voice actor and it was a joy listening to him in this movie, even though he isn't nearly as funny as he is in South Park. His character is stuck in the '80s and that's it. That's the whole joke surrounding his character. Gru's brother, Dru, is very rich and incapable of being a villain, but really wants to be one. That's his character. Gru is the same as he was in the last movie. All the characters are very flat. There's nothing interesting about them. Sure, it's an animated kids movie, but that's not a worthy excuse to have such boring and unfunny characters. Speaking of the characters, the minions have very little screen time and I couldn't have been happier. I used to love them when the first movie came out but I quickly realised a few years ago that they're incredibly annoying, unfunny and very cringe-inducing. Thankfully, this movie doesn't have much of them and it focuses more on the Gru-Dru interactions. The voice-acting was very off, though. Almost none of the voices fit the characters, especially Steve Carell. His accent in these movie is absolutely horrible and incredibly annoying. The animation, as well, is very dated. The first Despicable Me looks exactly the same as this one. It's very basic animation and they re-use a lot of the objects and characters which makes the whole movie look very bland and effortless. I've noticed some of the characters in the background don't even have a face! Compared to other big animated movies, the Despicable Me movies aren't made for that much money but earn an amazing amount. These movies aren't made for anything except for money. They're big cash grabs with cute little characters, lame and safe jokes, and heartfelt moments that really don't resonate well. All in all, Despicable Me 3 is not worth talking more about. It's a throwaway, mediocre and safe cash grab that is not worth your time or money.",

            "content": "Is Gru returning or saying goodbye?\n\nAfter the unthinkingly massive success that DreamWorks Animation got in world of children's cinema seven years ago, Gru and his fellow believers became, at the speed of light, in cult characters and direct representatives of pop culture, attaining, at the expense of their magnetic attraction components for audience (a funny and vile villain, a triad of girls with unbearably loving eyes and yellow beings in the form of pills that communicate each other by mixing dozens of languages) a second installment directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud and a spin-off in 2015. Today, it arrives-using as inspiration the money generated by the three previous ones-a third film with Gru as \"only\" protagonist, cornering a second place to the Minions, alternating their participation in form of escape quite similar to John Sturges's \"The Great Escape\" with Agnes' cravings for meeting a unicorn in the real world, a loving sub-plot between Margo and a village dweller, Lucy's efforts to become a good mother, the ghosts from the past that instigate Gru to leave behind the life of responsible father, the impact that his twin brother causes and the chase of the main villain who radiates 80's style through and through. They said that Hollywood original ideas had no longer a place in an American blockbuster, they are wrong, here there are, but with an oversaturation of stories that conclude condemning the feature film to the ranks of the summer film for lucrative purposes, one brimming with nutty entertainment just like the franchise.\n\nThe new ingredients of the recipe are introduced with independence, namely, are like mini-episodes attached with roughness in a story where coherence is conspicuous by its absence, but after all, that's the meaning of an animated film, a manumission from the ordinary world for the audience, however, doesn't enable it to insert a jerk of situations as diverse as unrelated. In addition to repletion of ideas that aren't boldness, there's a technical and visual section that doesn't exhibit fresh optimizations, the optical potential of a couple of scenes is hampered by the interception of previously commented sub-plots. Nonetheless, there is room for drama and action sequences, orchestrated with ability, in which they employ a palette of vivacious colors, graphics emulating reality with care and a photography elevating Chris Meledandri's proposal to the next level, at least visually.\n\nRegarding the most recent affiliations, antagonist Balthazar Bratt, an eighties star who is turned down publicly and commercially thanks to the arrival of pubescence and Dru, Gru's twin brother, an almost identical clone of the main character, except for a fulgent blonde mane and a snowy trousseau, provide a breath of fresh air to a universe with immeasurable possibilities ranging from peripheral products to worthy characters of their own installment, however, the captured effect isn't bilateral. Bratt's introduction, deploying a James Bond-style espionage plot, in the first two acts is tedious, lifeless and discouraged, it's not until the final apotheosis the extravagances of the former child idol consolidate motivations by which he goes villainy, crushing, allegorically, the emblematic Hollywood sign located at Monte Lee, Los Angeles. Dru doesn't get a completely interesting and innovative treatment, as a standalone character, however, his development is more enjoyable when he does a duet with his brother, opening the way for slapstick comedy. It's engrossing the final twist that, without resorting to spoilers, is a required and coherent exit to continue with the general leitmotiv of the universe. \n\nOne more time, we again witness amusing and argumentative expertise containing the Minions as supporting characters. They pass through a strike against their own master, the participation in a singing talent show and the escape of a high-security prison. Without a doubt, they're Squirrel Scraft counterpart in \"Ice Age\" franchise, that was used as a magnetic mechanism, something audience loves, especially the little ones.\n\nThe atmosphere impregnated by the villain is something unexplored for Dreamworks animations, making use of angles and editions of that time, in order to give cohesion to the past of the villain, nonetheless, visual achievements are not enough, they got with the character; soundtrack, present in most of his appearances, is made up of classics already established as \"Bad\" by Michael Jackson or \"99 Luftballons\" by Nena, beating around the bush with own musical compositions that had to be highlighted in the film.\n\nWith a story going nowhere because of the torrent of sub plots that the screenwriters embed in the middle of the footage, \"Despicable Me 3\", directed by Pierre Coffin, Kyle Balda and Eric Guillon, will please lovers of animated espionage and adults avid for an evening of cinema without demands, at the expense of the voice performances, the inherently hilarious occurrences of the Minions and incessant references to the 80's culture. For everyone else, the latest foray into children's cinema, the result of the alliance between Illumination and Dreamworks, falls by the wayside thanks to a creative mess that cannot be saved by a graphic section worthy of consideration, something that is not a matter of surprise nowadays.",

It's a tired franchise that did well and we all enjoyed it to begin with but my God you don't need to wring it the flop out! Illumination clearly just want to make money, and yet creative studios like Laika can only just make their budget. It's a sad world, it really is. Anyway, in this chapter Gru is up against an old nemesis known as Balthazar Bratt, whom is trapped in his own 80's bubblegum bubble, so that he can further his status in the Anti-Villain League. But wait, there's more! Lucy is trying to be a mother to Gru's children and gain their respect. Wait...we're not done yet? The flipping irritating minions leave Gru as he no longer pursues villainy and we follow them in their small mischievous adventure. Surely that's it right? Agnes really wants to find a unicorn for real and tries her best to tame one. Seriously, it's done...*sigh*. Gru finds out he has a twin brother called Dru who has the flamboyancy of a flamingo. Please...no more plots!? Balthazar Bratt wants the diamond so that he can destroy Hollywood. DONE. I'm done. So Illumination learnt that having no plot (The Secret Life of Pets) was bad...so let's include six instead!?! What a mess, I mean it was constantly switching between each plot. Could've made six different sequels, although thank God they didn't. There really wasn't any need for this film to exist, it doesn't further anything than the previous two had already done. No character development whatsoever. I thought some of the voice acting was abit off as well, particularly for the children. The minions are the worst species to ever be conceived in animation and AGAIN are annoying as hell. In fact, hell is less annoying. I however did like the villain and the 80's soundtrack, I could easily relate to that. The animation was fluid and vibrant as well. There are a few scenes of enjoyment and I did smile on certain occasions. But it's not enough to warrant another sequel to a franchise that should just end. Surely...SURELY there cannot be another one...",

Because, sure, the cast remains the same, the voice acting is sparky and full of life, like the animation, and the basic premise remains similar. Maybe it has too much of what made the series work in the first place. Is it that is has too much charisma, and too much of a willingness to please, and an unhealthy obsession with lowering the maturity of the jokes toward dispensable at the least and cringeworthy at the worst in order to win more cheap laughs?\n\nIt's hard to read too much into an animated children's movie - after all, it is just that - but unless you're easily pleased (nothing wrong with that) it is hard to thoroughly enjoy this. Laugh out loud jokes are few and far between, and the energy subsides after the first half hour.\n\nMany of the sequences, too, are comic-strip like and not in a good way. For example, the dance battles - basically a forced pop-culture referencing drag - are full of silly over the top dance moves in a poor substitute for an actual battle. As the villain sweeps Gru away by playing a loud note on his very dated electric guitar, it feels like it should have a big exclamation of KAPOW! or BOOM! But it doesn't, and it does it unironically. In fact, all the \"fight\" scenes are dreadful; characters unreasonably being saved just before being consumed by a giant murderous bubblegum bubble (yup).\n\nBut this is a children's movie after all, and they aren't exactly hard to make. It's just that some of the refreshing aspects have gone and not been replaced. Your kids will probably enjoy it, but whether you will is down to your personal tastes.\n\nA bit mundane and tired. Let's hope they have the sense to leave the franchise there (probably not). Maybe they should've gone out on the high of the first sequel.\n\nThe first two do it better.\n\n2/4\n\nPlease visit ozayrica.wixsite.com/moviereviews for more",

The story also didn't have a message. Which is the point of stories. The Movie also didn't have any of the classic weapons. No lipstick taser. No freeze ray. No fart gun. The only reason why this movie had any stars at all. Was because of Agnes finding a one horned goat and thinking it's a unicorn. Which I found Adorable",

However, with the additional of the now fashionable retro referrals it does add another comical dimension. But it's the same yarn we've seen before and honestly, I'm growing tired of Gru and his antics.\n\nThis time Gru reunites with his long lost brother, Dru, both obviously voiced by Carell, whilst the minions go on a revolt, wanting to return to a life of crime. It feels like the girls take a back seat in this one, with all attention on Gru and bro, filled with snippets of minion antics to keep viewers entertained. The minions are what save the movie from being a complete bore. Their rendition of Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance is nothing short of comic brilliance. But it isn't enough. \n\nI was actually really looking forward to meeting Balthazar Bratt, who is an excellent, vibrant villain and Trey Parker of South Park fame does a brilliant job at voicing him. But there wasn't enough of him, I wanted to see more, but the films shows little more than the trailers or it feels that way. I wasn't that interested in Dru, and found him annoying more than being funny. Maybe even Carell has grown tired of the part, as he's mentioned this is his final outing as Gru, but wouldn't say no to a cameo in the Minions sequel. \n\nI have to keep reminding myself that it's a family film and the kids probably love it, but it really feels like a lazy addition and just another vehicle to boost merchandise and toy sales. Sadly, most of the best and funny bits are shown in the trailer. It actually feels more like a spinoff than being a main feature, like those straight to DVD releases many of these family films do. \n\nWhat did I like about the movie? The soundtrack was good, though the score is easily forgettable. It's beautifully done, but there's everything we've already seen. Sadly, I think it's the end of Gru. \n\nRunning Time: 5\nThe Cast: 6\nPerformance: 6\nDirection: 6\nStory: 5\nScript: 5\nCreativity: 6\nSoundtrack: 7\nJob Description: 2\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 0\n\n48% 5/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

You've seen it before in countless films whether it be something along the lines of Austin Powers in Goldmember or even something as wacky as the Fast & Furious franchise that can't help but to keep bringing people back and connecting them in unforeseen ways. With the inevitable Despicable Me 3 the folks over at Illumination animation have decided to take this route and approach their film as if Gru (again voiced by Steve Carell) fell into something of a Parent Trap situation, but the two never ended up going to summer camp together. Instead, it is after the passing of their father that his long-lost twin brother, Dru (also voiced by Steve Carell), contacts the newly married and newly heroic Gru in order to connect and maybe try to pull him back into his old ways of villainy. It's a fine enough device, I guess, and it mostly works because Carell's voice work is so amusing in how he slightly differentiates the two and then has to subsequently voice both Gru and Dru doing impressions of one another in what is arguably the most entertaining and genuinely funny scene in the movie. If any other scene in the film had a hint of the kinds of layers or even this kind of wacky creativity in the sense of trying to accomplish something due only to the fact it presents an interesting challenge then the film as a whole might have in fact been more interesting, but as it is Despicable Me 3 is more of the same, but busier. Busier in that it wants you and the children you're presumably taking to the theater to think there is a ton of stuff happening on screen when in reality all you're seeing is a collection of disparate scenes strung together by the standard objective of attempting to steal the biggest jewel in the world. That said, Despicable Me 3 doesn't really have to be anything more than what it is as it is just funny enough and just consistently colorful enough to feel like the shiny new product it needs to be in order to please the masses who will spend their hard-earned money on it.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

And then there's the guilty pleasures of Gru and his Minions. There was undeniable charm in their eccentric though infantile humour but the main appeal is their cheeky, rather gruesome and anarchic tone. But as they get more popular, that gets more diluted out. During the course of the trilogy, Gru has acquired 3 adorable girls, a wife and now a brother in that order. And as a result of that ballooning cast, it becomes problematic to find a plot, no matter how slight,  for everyone to hang around for and the Minions, by far the funniest creation of the franchise, are sidetracked. Thankfully these separate and scattered storylines - unicorn hunting; Lucy being a trainee mum, an 80s obsessed villain (funniest thing since the Minions and aptly voiced by Trey Parker of South Park) and of course Gru's discovery of his twin brother, somehow manage to converge, together with the Minions which literally drift back in after what is in essence a mini-Minion-movie detour, in the finale. The film remains as colourful and dazzling as its predecessors but this outing feels patchier and it will need to get more inventive and focused for this over-aged viewer if you want me to pay again the next time.",

Things_are_looking_up_for_Gru when_he_meets_his_twin_brother, Dru(Steve_Carrel), and_sets_up_a_plan_to_get_his_job_back_and_foil_Bratt's_scheme.\n\nThis movie is far superior to that abomination called 'Minions'. I do suppose that slow and painful death would be better than that 'movie'. So it definitely gets points for not being Minions. That said, it is far inferior to Despicable Me 1 & 2. The cast is the same, the jokes are the same, the animation is the same; it just lacks heart. The first film had the girls, the second had Lucy - this has his brother but they don't explore the emotional aspect of that anymore than Transformers explores the deeper meaning of life and existence. If you wanna zone out for 90 minutes and let your young child be absorbed in bright colours, I recommend this movie. It's a good time waster but that is all it is. It has no purpose and that is a massive flaw of the movie. Not to say the rest of it is spectacular.\n\nThe story, for example, is very weak. Don't give me that rubbish that this is a 'kid's movie'. It's animated; there is a difference. Pixar has literally created a template for how animated movies should appease all audiences, and 2/3 of this trilogy stuck to that template. This doesn't. The story is nonsensical and just has no rhyme or reason to it. It isn't logical and it doesn't contain enough meat to make it work. Clearly very swiftly thrown together and I expect more that that. The ending was also pretty childish but I guess it is fine for kids.\n\nOne thing that I usually demand in animation is a good moral. Morals that affect both children and adults equally are the best kind. This movie lacks a moral entirely. They hint at a possible moral involving family and brotherhood but they never commit to it. That makes the entire viewing experience pointless. Kids should watch for enjoyment but also gain something from the experience. No moral makes this entire movie seem pointless and that isn't what your film should ever feel like.\n\nStevel Carell is the only reason these movies are even remotely watchable. He's found the fine line between funny and obnoxious, and balances that tightrope perfectly. Carell is consistently funny throughout and maintains the glue that holds it together. Trey Parker was excellent as Bratt and was easily the best part of the movie. I adored every single scene he was in and he turned it from a plane crash into a train wreck, so a little big let horrific. Kristen Wig was good as Lucy and I did like the whole mother subplot. Nev Scharell was good as Agnes but her entire subplot was completely pointless. Miranda Cosgrove had negative seconds dedicated to her in this movie thus I shall not praise nor criticise her. Dana Gaier was fine in her limited screen time but that is another flaw of the film. The girls had no screen time. Agnes had a minor subplot, yes, but that meant nothing in the grand scheme of things. They were the heart and soul of the first movie yet had no time to blossom in this movie. If they gave a lot of focus to the relationship between either Gru and Dru, or Gru and Lucy but they don't and that is why this movie fails. I was very disappointed.\n\nWhat can every sane human being agree on? Minions are fine in minute doses. This was confirmed with 2015's Minions but Illumination saw it another way. They saw the critical panning of that atrocity to be a cry for 'we want MORE Minions'. This statement is both absurd and god damn ludicrous. Any human being who wishes for more of those yellow faced turnips has a special place for them reserved in hell because they are the bane of humanity! I guarantee if he was still with us, Hitler would have been a Minions fan. They're that despicable(pun intended). Stop shoving Minions down our throats. We DO NOT want more of them. Please. Stop.\n\nTechnically speaking, I really like this movie. The colour pallet is very bright and illuminated(pun intended) that it just makes your eyes fixate to the screen. I imagine kids will appreciate the bright colours a lot, also. Models on the various characters were fun and inventive and fit well with the more exaggerated view of reality. Some nice shots and slithers of cinematography are sprinkled in there for good measure as well. As a whole, I was very, very pleased with the animation in this movie.\n\nHumour is a completely subjective thing and I won't completely criticise or praise a movie based on it. That said, I very rarely chuckled in this movie. I never gave a full laugh but some kids in the audience were laughing beyond belief so I guess they hit there target audience. I frequently smiled(and even chuckled) at Carrel and Parker but after them there was little for me to enjoy. They were the leads so it is fair they get the most jokes but even then none of them made me burst out laughing. Parker was easily the funniest part of the movie for me but the visual comedy he used probably impressed adults more than kids which I guess could be considered a flaw due to the villain not appealing to kids as much but I liked it so it gets a gold star in my book.\n\nOverall, I can recommend this movie if you want 90 minutes rest and are fine with your kids being absorbed by bright colours. I don't recommend this movie if your not in that position because it is lazy, nonsensical and unfunny. It lacks any heart to make it worthwhile and, aside from the animation, I cannot say anything really stood out. I'll rate it a disappointing 3 Moonwalks out of 10.",

It also is a kids movie that's made 3 good (or decent) films, so applause for that.\n       That being said, this movie isn't nearly as funny as the first two. I laughed at some things in this movie, it just wasn't as consistently funny as the first two. Steve Carell's voice performance as Gru and his twin brother is great, just the script wasn't as solid as I know this series is capable of. It also didn't feel as original as the first two for the most part. Another great thing, however, was Trey Parker's talented performance as the villain. He's funny and sometimes intimidating. I love his voice acting on South Park, and he carried it through to this.\n       The other main problem I had with this movie was some of the character development. There were lots of opportunities. This movie showed that it wanted to go through with that and just didn't. It starts out plot lines that could have been interesting, and never finishes them. This could have been a lot more satisfying if it had just followed a certain plot line and showed character development and made the viewing expirience more enjoyable for the audience. This was something the first two films did a great job of and I wish this movie had carried through. Nonetheless, one of the plot lines is at least satisfied at the end, and there were character challenges between Gru and Dru that I really liked.\n       Overall, Despicable Me 3 might seem a little forced and have some plot lines it could expand on, but it has funny and heartfelt characters and great voice performances. It also has enough good humor like the first two films without stretching out or repeating jokes. Fans of the series and kids will enjoy it!",

The story is full of the bunches of humor that the other movies in the series have, along with some of the mild peril and action that the other movies include as well. This movie, first of all, shows you how well Steve Carell does acting as Gru once again. And what's more, Carell not only does a good job playing Gru, he also has an equally great act as Gru's twin brother Dru. Along with this, the action is entertaining and sometimes funny, which makes this movie even better. However, the minions aren't in this movie as much as in the others, and that does subtract from the quality of humor in the movie, and may also disappoint kids because they make the movie so unique and funny. But this movie, besides a little bit of some rude humor, is appropriate for kids. Finally, this movie has a well thought through and has a good storyline, especially in terms of a third movie. Despicable Me 3 is overall a great movie",

            "content": "2016 was a big year for illumination. Their two films The Secret Life of Pets and Sing made them a pile of money and showed the world that they can make money outside of the Despicable Me franchise. They were also awful films, that just didn't work at all. They were frenetic and overstuffed, and were trying desperately to entertain you at all times. Despicable Me 3 certainly has this same mentality, but it's also looser, weirder and far more entertaining.\nAfter failing to catch Balthazar Brat (voiced by series new comer Trey Parker), Gru (Steve Carell) and Lucy (Kristen Wiig) are fired by the Anti Villain League. At the same time Gru learns he has a twin brother Dru (also voiced by Steve Carell), who is the heir to a large pig farming operation. Dru however wants to get into the family business of villainy, while Lucy wants to bond with Gru's adopted children. At the same time Balthazar Brat is attempting to get revenge on Hollywood after they fired him from his hit show in the 19080's.\nHowever what people really want to see are the Minions, and to be honest there not in the film that much and there scenes are so poorly written that they just fall painfully flat. Part of the problem with the minion scenes and with the film as whole is the way that the film launches punchlines to jokes with no set-up rendering the jokes rather confusing and sometimes painfully unfunny.  The bonding scenes between Gru and Dru also feel rushed and half-assed, and are easily the weakest element of the film.\nYet Despicable Me 3 also finds the franchise fixing some of it's biggest problems. The series has never had interesting or fun villains, but Balthazar Brat is a spectacular villain. Trey Parker voices him with a mad level of intensity and relish and he is visually fun and distinctive. He also is by far the most fleshes out and interesting character in the film and the filmakers gave him all of the best lines and moments. He feels like a breath of fresh air, that you wish the movie had more of him and less of the boilerplate family bonding shenanigans. The action scenes (another weak point of the series as a whole) are also surprisingly fun. There imbued with a sense of gee-whiz fun that powers the film through its more underwhelming moments. On the whole it's wildly uneven but consistently daffy and at times rather inspired",

Clearly the directors tried connecting a bunch of somewhat funny scenes into a movie...and the result isn't even mediocre. There are many extra plots that have nothing to do with the main story, and the worst part is they're not even funny. In fact, there were so few scenes that actually made me laugh that I wondered if this was supposed to be a comedy at all. The new characters were overly cheesy and said lines that wouldn't even be used in normal conversations. Gru, the minions, Lucy, and the girls weren't much better. Looks like Dru's horrible characterization rubbed off on even his awesome super villain brother. \nDon't watch this unless you want to waste $12 of your hard earned money on 2 hours of halfhearted acting and flashy graphics.",

            "content": "Grade:  B\n\nRating: PG, 90 minutes\n\nIn a Nutshell:  This is the 3rd installment in the Despicable Mefranchise (4th if you count Minions).  It's not as good as the first two, but it's still silly fun for families.\n\nThe detailed animation is absolutely outstanding. The movements, colors, textures, voices, water, and facial expressions are incredible.  The physical humor is adorable.\n\nUplifting theme: \nFamily\nKindness\nImagination\n\nThings I liked:\nI'm a twin, so I was excited to see Gru's twin.  If you're one too, be sure to go to the annual \"Twins Days Festival\" in Twinsburg, Ohio at least once in your lifetime.  It's awesome and hilarious.  Steve Carell has always done an excellent job with Gru's lovable accent and now he adds a double who has a voice that is similar, yet different.  Well done.\nThe 80's villain \"Balthazar Bratt\" voiced by Trey Parker is really funny.  I love his dance moves retro style.  Watching him do aerobics on that exercise ball made me laugh out loud.  Complete with a Michael Jackson cassette tape and bubblegum-launching shoulder pads, he steals every scene he is in.  I love the detail of his bald spot.  Dance battle!\nPharrell Williams did most of the music, making for a foot-tapping soundtrack.  The cutest musical moment for me was when the minions sing \"Papa Mama Loca Pipa\" in the \"Sing\" competition.\nI love Jenny Slate's voice and think she's perfect in animated movies.    \n The lovely Julie Andrews gives us a cameo voice talent of Gru's mom.\nOther voice talents include Russell Brand, Steve Coogan, and the SNL favorite Kristen Wiig.\nThe Cheese Festival had some fun features, like that slide grater people went down on a chunk of giant cheese.  Ha ha\nI'd like a magical unicorn to help me do math too. \n\n\n\n\nThings I didn't like:\nAs a mom, I don't appreciate that the advertising tagline is \"It's good to be bad.\"  Really?  That's what you want to teach our kids?  One of the Minions holds up a sign that says, \"Be bad!\"\nSome themes could have gone much deeper.  Instead, there are a lot of story lines going on, so the movie just doesn't have time to explore them all.\nThe movie never reaches a truly emotional moment like Pixar is so brilliant at doing.\nYou'll chuckle, and maybe even a lot, but probably not belly-laugh.\n The finger-snapping Minions are still cute, but moving dangerously close to the annoying Jar Jar Binks status.  In fact, they get crude and violent in this film.  Not cool. \n\nFunny lines:\n\"Heist music!\" - Balthazar Bratt\n\"Dance fight!\" -  Balthazar Bratt\n\"Son of a Beta Max!\" - Balthazar\n\"I saw a unicorn once.\" - guy in a bar\n\"Was it fluffy?\" - Margo (Miranda Cosgrove)\n\"It was so fluffy I thought I was gonna die.\" - guy\n\"Sqeeeeeeee!\" - Margo\n* \"Yes, Molly Ringwald.  I will take you to the prom.\" - Balthazar Bratt\n\n\n \n\nTips for parents: \nYou see Gru's naked back side.\nThe minions stick out their tongues and say, \"Pffffth\" often.   Fair warning: your little ones may think that's hilarious and want to imitate it.  They're also going to want to hunt for a real unicorn. Squee!\n Animated violence and destruction.\nNeed to catch up on the first 3 films in the series?  You can find them cheap on Amazon, just in time for Amazon's annual Prime Day!\nDespicable Me \n\nDespicable Me 2\n\nMinions\n\n\n\n@trinaboice",

Well, he was right, because the only relevant thing they did in the movie, was just blow up the gum bubble with dynamite, which any of the other characters would have done, even The Minions without leaving Gru. Parties like Agnes looking for a unicorn, or the boy in love with Margo contribute something in the plot of the film? NO, giving us to understand that none of the subplots of the film were important, the only relevant thing, were only the villain, and Gru's brother, everything else you can remove and does not affect the plot of the film at all.

Even so, this film does not stop having its conveniences to save Gru and Dru, as from nothing comes what apparently is Lucy to save them at the exact moment, and I say apparently because it was actually Balthazar in disguise, this does not stop be convenient, because to save them, if I had perfectly let them die and recover their diamond? and more importantly, how could he free himself from the gum where he was caught? but of course, let a story gap, where Balthazar with all his mental agility, broke free of gum, disguised as Lucy, and climbed in a helicopter, in less than a  minute,  OF HIS PARTY!\nThey just used that as an excuse to give us the bad guy's surprise by posing as an ally, right? and in the event that in reality that was not Balthazar disguised, and it was the real Lucy, it would be almost the same or even worse, since that would make it a very convenient Plot Armor, just to save Gru and his twin. They never explain who except Gru and his twin at that moment, you see where you see it, whoever saved them is wrong on both sides, with real Lucy, because it took so long and I wait until the moment where he saves them? if she was following them, because she was slow to appear? and Lucy did not wait there to save them, because everything was clear and she was just arriving, it is little credible that she had arrived at the exact moment when Gru and her twin were escaping. With fake Lucy, to free herself with a speed higher than the sound with a plot hollow, and save them instead of letting them die. And no matter which of the 2 bone, how did Balthazar track him down? since at that time, Balthazar did not know Gru's twin, therefore, as he knew they were in his mansion? they never explain to us how it was, since they practically could not follow them if they passed themselves off as Lucy, and could not have traced them if they were still stuck in that gum, they did not even put any part where they could be followed, or they climbed helicopter without anyone noticing. The pure fact that he knew where they are without any explanation, already counts as a plot hole. A final that I also saw coming, and that I forgot to mention in the video, is that Dru joined the group. I do not dislike the inclusion of the brother at all, although he was forced into the plot, since apart from his personality seems acceptable to me, being the typical loving brother who shit on everything, makes the Minions return to doing villainy as they did before. With respect to music, those songs of the 80s if they fit the movie, being Michael Jackson's most memorable. The humor of the film, which is what is supposed to be the most salvageable, sincerely, I DO NOT REY IN THE MOST MINIMUM, and more because most remarkable jokes, they show up to the point of exhaustion in the  trailers of youtube, without tell that sometimes the jokes get to get something stupid and forced. Yes, they got to put some other adult joke to the movie, but go unnoticed. 5/10",

As for the new Dru is funny and just likeable then the villain Balthazar Bratt who is a top 10 non-Disney/Pixar villain of all time he is just hilarious and great. Overall it does lack a bit of story but makes up for it with for spot on humor the best animation of the franchise and the characters old and new are funny and likeable. 10/10",

            "content": "Proper Perspective: If you are more of a fan of the Minions product than the Despicable Me product, then this is likely the movie for you. The story follows Gru and his family, but it is a significant drop in quality from Despicable Me 1 & 2. Let's talk about Despicable Me 3...\n\nOfficial Synopsis: Gru meets his long-lost charming, cheerful, and more successful twin brother Dru who wants to team up with him for one last criminal heist.\n\nPlot: When unable to take down a major villain Gru and Lucy are fired, then meet Gru's twin brother who wants to drag him back into a life of crime.\n\nTake: I'm trying to put my finger on what was different between this movie and the previous two Despicable Me movies, which I enjoyed, and the only rational answer I can come up with is feels rushed. I thought the first movie was fine, serviceable. The second was more fun and I truly enjoyed the continuation of the story, but the third one landed with a thud for me.\n\nThe story just felt stale, lazy, and rushed. \n\nBetween Despicable Me 1 and 2 there was a full three years, then when the studio realized Minions were insanely popular the Minions movie was turned around in two years and the same for this movie, just two years. How to Train Your Dragon had four years between sequels and the Toy Story franchise have four years and then 11 years.\n\nWhether this was rushed or not, it felt like it and the characters were stale or retreads. There was nothing fun or fresh about Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker) or Dru (Steve Carrell). \n\nExploring the family dynamic was what made the first two movies unique and interesting. In the first movie Gru learned to accept a family, then in the sequel he was a full-fledged father when kids starting yearning for a mother figure. Enter Lucy (Kristen Wiig). This movie tried to explore Lucy becoming a mother, but that story got maybe a scene or two. The focus on twin humor and minions took over and the movie ultimately did not work for me.\n\nHaving said that my kids gave it four thumbs up.\n\nRecommendation: Skip this and anything Minion related. I cannot stand what those things represent for our culture and the direction things are going with dumbing down all forms of entertainment. Skip, and go see Captain Underpants with the kids or Wonder Woman or Guardians 2 or literally anything else...\n\nTwin jokes! Parenting hijinks situational humor! Minions doing dumb things! Roll Picture!",

Despicable Me 3 does not show this film series to be going stale but does not exceed its average expectations. This movie displays great animation in a fun children's story. If one has nothing to do, this is an enjoyable hour and a half with some laughs for most age demographics. Not much, however, is added to the development of the characters besides the introduction of Gru's brother. There were points in the film where one thinks they have an idea of the direction it will proceed with, but it fails to follow through. Instead we are given an animated adventure comedy that still makes you feel at home with Gru, and especially the Minions, and mindless entertainment for a pleasant 90 minutes. Compared to other third films in movie series, Despicable Me 3 provides a fresh addition to the loveable franchise. These films should continue with their consistent directors and screenwriters to bring more fun adventures with the great characters, though hopefully in a more meaningful way in the future.

As the story moves on and illumination films gives the movies more of a budget, Despicable Me 3 has become the best of the series yet.

Despicable Me 3 is fun for the whole family and is inclusive for every age group and every demographic. The movie is a fresh vacation from the current stale \"action movie\" format plaguing Hollywood. Despicable Me 3 is also a departure from the formula of the series as Gru's brother is introduced (although the film still brings its flawless mainstay minions to the table.)

            "content": "I suppose it was inevitable that eventually we'd be seeing this. Illumination, the computer animation company that produces these movies, was founded in 2010, and since then has made only one really good movie - their first, 2010's Despicable Me. Okay, maybe not really good to other people, but I liked it quite a bit. It was sweet, had an interesting plot, was hilarious, and, best of all, was very visually inventive and creative with its different contraptions, secret hideouts, and machines. \n\tSince then, Illumination hasn't had much to offer other than a couple meh originals, a Dr. Seuss adaptation here and there, and of course, Despicable Me sequels (and spinoffs.) I wasn't among the many Despicable Me 2 fans out there, nor was I among the not-so-many Minions fans out there. But I am a fan of Despicable Me 3. \n\tI'll attempt to explain the plot, but you'll have to bear with me because there are about four. First we have Gru (voiced wonderfully once again by Steve Carrel) going to meet his long-lost twin brother, Dru (also Steve Carrel). Then we have the Minions, who no one can seem to get enough of, leaving Gru for good after he refuses to return to villainy and ending up in prison. Then we have Lucy (Kristen Wiig), Gru's wife, worrying about how good of a mother she is. Then we have Agnes (Nev Scharrel), Gru's youngest, going on a mission to find a real unicorn. Oh, and by the way, there's also Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), an 80's super villain who has some devious plots of his own. \n\tSo yeah, you get the gist. It feels more like a series of Saturday morning cartoons than like an actual movie, but I didn't mind that so much. I liked Saturday morning cartoons, and I know the kids in the audience certainly do. I was entertained as the various plots moved along, and surprised by how well they consolidated at the end. Not everyone will feel the same way, I'm sure. The way the plots unite is revealed subtly rather than in your face like most kid's movies, and if you're not paying attention you'll miss it. \n\tI knew going into this movie that it didn't get stellar review from either critics or audiences, but that didn't curb my enthusiasm at all because I knew exactly what I was going to get. And I got that for the most part. It was entertaining, goofy, and fun, and possessed a certain charm that only a Despicable Me movie can. The first half is a bit worrisome the way it unfolds, but when it gets into its element in the second half, it becomes a fun, candy-colored joyride that charms in exactly the ways you hope it does with this kind of movie. It's miles from the quality of the first Despicable Me, but it still manages to be a satisfying summer kid's movie. \n\n-- \nRating: 3/4",

I didnt particularly like what I saw in the trailers for the 3rd installment of the franchise, but I still held out hope that they would recapture the magic. Sadly, they didnt even come close. Im fairly mad at this film right now, but before I start my rant I thought it would be good to say I did like some elements. The minions are still cute and have a few funny moments. Also, the new villain introduced in this movie (Balthazar Bratt) is a great character who gives me all kinds of warm fuzzy memories of the 1980s. Any time there was direct fighting with him I was on board. Now lets tear this movie down a few pegs\n\nThere is one simple blatantly obvious problem with Despicable Me 3 that I cannot stand. They are trying to cram too many stories into one movie. This movie attempts to do so much that it falls short of doing anything well. Allow me to list all the plot threads they attempt and why they dont work. (Warning: some of this might be considered spoilers if you care about that stuff) =\n\n1. The super-villain Balthazar Bratt is stealing the worlds largest diamond for use in his evil scheme, so Gru and Lucy want to stop him. This is easily the best aspect of the movie, and it is what should have been the main plot of the film. One (maybe two) small subplots could have been included to enrich this primary narrative, but nothing more. Instead it feels like there are large chunks of this film where the A-story isnt even touched because theyre so busy dealing with all the other stories.\n\n2. Gru and Lucy lose their jobs at the Anti-Villain League because new management takes over. This is loosely connected with the main story, so I guess it was OK, but they didnt use it to do anything. I cannot think of a single way that this genuinely impacted the plot of this film other than creating added desperation in Gru to catch Bratt. We dont even see the new director of the AVL again after that first scene where she fires them.\n\n3. Gru has a long-lost twin brother who wants to meet him, and learn to become a super-villain. I cannot express how stupid this part of Despicable Me 3 felt, and it comes out of nowhere. If I hadnt seen trailers beforehand, I probably would have said aloud Wait, what?! Were doing this now? It does not connect with anything that has happened prior to that point, and it takes the entire movie down a needless rabbit trail. I genuinely think there were 2 different scripts for this movie and someone just mashed them together, and thats why we detour for Gru and Drus misadventures.\n\n4. The Minions stage a mutiny. Since Grus not evil enough anymore, they just dont want to work for him. Basically the entire cast of Minions run away and have their own journey through the movie. Their spokes-minion Mel is the least-enjoyable Minion ever. Hes kind of a whiner and complainer, so I dont like him being at the center of all their stuff. Also every time the movie shows us the Minions (since theyre off on their own) it literally means the entire plot has to slam on the brakes so we can explore whats happening with them.\n\n5. Lucy wants to become a better mother to the girls. Its cliche, but for a kids movie like Despicable Me 3, I imagine this probably should have been the only B-story because it makes sense considering where the last movie left off. There arent many surprising beats in this little sub-plot, and you never totally get the feeling that the girls are learning to bond with her. Much of the problem is based on the fact that there is so much other stuff cluttering up the film, so Lucy gets short shrift. Still, it could have been something if they committed to it more.\n\n6. Agnes wants to find a real unicorn. I cant even talk about this, it was so dumb and pointless. And yet there are at least 3 entire scenes centered around this one stupid subplot. Also, they changed voice actresses for Agnes (probably because the original girl is getting too old) and it was super obvious. Now she sounds a little too old to believe that unicorns are real.\n\nTheres more in the movie as well, but I think you get the point. Despicable Me 3 is only ninety minutes long, so it cant sustain this much story. And they dont even try to make strong connections between the different plots. Its not as if everything comes together in a logical way to win in the end, we just continue to get bounced around as they separately address 6 or more things that need to be resolved. Worst of all, they were so busy shoving more and more plot into this movie that they forgot the comedy. I did not laugh through most of this film. In fact, I was so disconnected from what was happening on screen that I got bored. I wanted to take a nap in the middle of it. While Ive certainly seen worse films in my life, Despicable Me 3 is so disappointing that it made me more angry than a lot of lesser movies. Dont waste your time on this one.",

It's an improvement over Minions, that's for sure. Just like with every Illumination Entertainment film, the animation becomes more visually dazzling than the last film. It's funny, although I was expecting more. But maybe that's because I'm still calming down from laughing my way through The Lego Batman Movie. The fact that the Minions are just there for kiddie appeal and do nothing to contribute to the plot should make older audiences happy. A scene where they're in prison also seems to be a case of Illumination referencing how everyone runs away whenever the Minions are present and how, despite mixed reviews, still made a billion dollars at the box office almost threatening Frozen's position as the highest-grossing animated film of all time. There's some pretty entertaining voice acting too. Perhaps it doesn't quite match up to the first two movies but there's still some entertainment value. You barely earned four stars from me, DM3, just barely.",

I know adults who would never say \"I'm going to see Despicable Me 3.\" But they would say \"I'm going to see the minions.\" Also, my Mom was the first in our movie group to suggest that there weren't enough minions this time around. Just sayin'.\n\nWe all know the third movie in a trilogy is often the weakest, and that's probably true here. Not that there's anything wrong with it, particularly. It's just not the funniest or most heart-warming of the bunch. It's more of the same, and a little less inspired. Perhaps Agnes would say it's a little less fluffy.\n\nIt's also a little less focused on the minions than prior movies. At one point Gru even says that he misses the minions (my Mom agrees). The minion's journey in this movie is essentially an abbreviated version of their road trip in the Minions movie. This time, they manage to land themselves in jail, which seemed like the minion's showcase sequence in the film, but also felt glossed over. Personally, I would have liked to have seen how the minions came to be prison's alpha gang. \n\nAll of that said, Despicable Me 3 is far better than the last Illumination cartoon I saw (The Secret Life of Pets) and looked far better than any of the animated films showcased in the trailers (none of which I'll see). If you liked previous Despicable or Minion films, you'll be fine. \n\nSo my initial reaction to DM3 was \"it was OK.\" But I'll still probably buy the Blu Ray and then eventually go see Minions 2 or Despicable Me 4, whichever comes first.

I am mystified how this movie is getting any star ratings above a one or two. There is no real plot, compelling or otherwise, which made the movie drag on relentlessly. About 30 minutes into the movie, I was so bored I started to nod off. The only reason I didn't was because, at that exact moment, the music ratcheted up several notches. To add insult to injury, they also messed with the personalities of the characters. They changed Lucy  from a lovable, strong, confident woman into an insecure mom, who had no idea when or how to say no to the girls. And, they made Gru's mom into a weirdo lech, which was really odd and out of place. My overall impression as I left the theater was of someone throwing a bunch of paint at a canvas and hoping something would stick. If this is what passes as a good movie these days, the bar has sunk ridiculously low. Save your money. If you must see it, wait until it's in the $3 bin at Walmart. It shouldn't take long.",

We see that, despite their comical nature, when they all pull together, they're a force to be reckoned with, even coming off as intimidating at times, & they didn't lose what made them endearing in the first place. As for the rest of the cast, Gru & Lucy still feel like partners in crime fighting, but they also feel like a married couple...from a sitcom...which worked...kind've... The girls did take a bit of a back seat in the plot, but they did manage to have their own adventure without bogging things down. Dru, Gru's twin brother, is an interesting mixed bag, no spoilers, but how he & Gru worked off each other was the film's highlight. The villain was hilariously tragic, as an '80s baby, who grew up in the '90s, watching mostly '80s shows, he was a hoot-&-a-half for me to watch! He was a walking reference filled cheese fest, & I loved every minuet of his screen time!\n\nThe action & effects were great, everyone looked like they did before, but there seemed to be more weight to them, like they were real people being filmed, & the way they interacted with the world, gave everything some decent real-world physics, clearly the animators have reached a whole new level with their art!\n\nThis film deserves & is getting 3 minions out've 5, the parents'll get the '80s references, the kids'll get the humor, it's a film that the whole family can enjoy, & continues one wonderfully despicable franchise!\n\nNow, to business.

The best thing about this movie just like the other two movies are that it is FUNNY. I laughed so many times all throughout the movie. Dru I feel is a very likeable and funny character, especially for an all new and introduced character. The only two problems I would say about this movie are that the story in a way is a cliche. The stuff there is in this movie are things I have seen before in others. One thing that makes the first two great are that they have unique stories in their own way. Also, the minions, while funny as hell just like in the other two movies as well as Minions, I feel like they were a bit of stand alone characters this time around. In the first two, they seemed like not necessarily main characters, but big side characters. Sure this makes sense because they go their separate ways after(spoiler if you have not seen the movie yet) Gru refuses to go back to villainy, but I feel like they could have been big side characters just like in the first two movies. And one small complaint is how (once again spoilers) Dr. Nefario isn't in the movie, which I thought was a bit disappointing because I really like him. But other than those two flaws and minor complaint, this is definitely a movie worth seeing! The characters are just great, especially villain, Balthazar Bratt. He's so much like Vector from the first movie and then some. Also, the pacing is great, and the movie is overall just very very entertaining from start to finish. 9 out of 10. I may not like it more than the original, but it's right on the same level as the second movie. A prime example of a really great trilogy, take notes, Cars.",

            "content": "Chris' Movie Review (Visit our Facebook page \"Brotherhood Of Okay Reviews\" for more reviews just like this.)\n\nDespicable Me 3\n\nRating: 6/10 (Fine)\nRecommendation: Redbox It\n\nI don't hate this series of movies. I honestly like the first film. The second, meh. When I heard they were doing a third movie, I thought \"This is too much.\" But after some thought, it made sense. Now it's just a matter of whether or not this film is any good. (Short answer: \"Eh.\")\n\nDespicable Me 3 stars Steve Carell (Gru/Dru), Kristen Wiig (Lucy), and Trey Parker (Balthazar).\n\nPlot Summary\n\nAfter failing to capture 80's Tv star Balthazar, Gru and Lucy get fired from work. Upon their firing, Gru finds out that he has a brother Dru. Gru goes to meet Dru where Dru attempts to bring Gru back into the villain world. Also, how do they Minions end up in jail? \n\nReview\n\nDespicable Me 3 is a franchise that shouldn't have 3 movies but it does. The first film is good. The second rushes way too many plot elements and certain stories aren't developed like they should be. And the third...well.\n\nFor starters, Despicable Me has a good voice acting cast. Steve has really held the fort down in all three movies. Kristen has been a nice addition. And Trey Parker....\n\nLet's get this out of the way, if you like/watch South Park, you know that Trey is one of the creators of the show. You also know he voices a bunch of the characters in the show. So when Balthazar comes on screen, all you can think of is South Park. Is that a bad thing? No. But it is distracting. Especially since it feels like Trey had no creative control over his lines in the movie. \n\nThis may feel like a side rant, and it is to an extent, but Trey should've had some creative control over the script for his character (It's possible that he did but it doesn't feel like it). Trey could've brought another level to the character of Balthazar but unfortunately he starts to feel really flat about halfway through the movie. All the villains of this franchise actually do this but with Trey, you'd just expect better.\n\nAnother hit on this movie is the story arc. The first film had a charm to it. Gru learned how to become loving and caring towards his 3 girls. In the second movie, Gru fell in love with Lucy...and then that way disregarded like it never existed because Minions. And the third, he meets his brother? Yeah, it sort of just kills the mood.\n\nI know I'm grouping the three movies together but each one is very similar. And what's disappointing is that the creators didn't learn from their mistakes/expand the story arcs. We do not get enough of Gru, Lucy, and their daughters. This is the core of the movie and each film goes further away from this premise. Which is sad because these characters are set up for major success but they kept doing the same formula over and over. What's the formula, you ask? Well....\n\nEach movie has a villain. Each film has a little bit of family. Each movie has more and more Minions. As the franchise progressed, the films would/will bring in more and more Minion appearances. Which, yes, they do get a laugh or two, but they're not important. They aren't the main character arcs. They are meant for a few jokes and to be pushed aside from there. But no, let's keep pushing the Minions down your throat because you laughed at them the first time.\n\nLook, if you enjoy their comedy, that's fine. I did like some the jokes, but they aren't the story. The plot is Gru and his family. That's the story the Despicable Me franchise got away from. They left it to die, essentially, so they could show you the same movie over and over again. Which is just despicable. They have Gru, Lucy, and the girls. They are interesting enough on their own. Let them shine. Stop bringing in all of these side characters. Dru was never needed. Keep the villain if you want but focus the growth of the family first. Don't exclude them because you can't break the formula. Argh!\n\nThis is going to sound crazy, but I didn't hate this movie. Everything in it is fine. I could give you the typical review, which I started out doing, but this needed to be talked about. I really believe the Despicable Me franchise could've been tremendous. Unfortunately, the creators didn't think it was necessary to do that and we got the same movie again. \n\nIf we get a 4th, I hope they just focus on Gru and his family. That could be a great movie to end everything. But I'm guessing they won't do that. End rant.\n\nOverall\n\nOther than that lengthy rant, Despicable Me 3 is fine. It progresses a little too fast but it's just same movie as the first and second with a different villain. That's really about it.\n\nThe characters don't grow. The story is a rehash of the first. And Dru becomes grading over time. But the Minions do get a few good jokes. Balthazar does provide some entertainment. And Gru is still a good character to watch on screen.\n\nIf you liked the first two, then you'll like this one. Does it fail in many aspects? Sure, but that's more about my disappointment towards the movie than anything else.\n\nAs usual, thanks for reading!",

            "content": "The Despicable Me series has been innocent entertainment for kids. Illumination Studios has managed to stretch its simple premise into four movies now if you include the Minions spinoff movie. In the latest outing, we find that Gru's (Carell) days of being the world's greatest villain are long over. He and his wife Lucy (Wiig) are currently working for the Anti-Villain League only to be kicked out when they fail to capture Balthazar Bratt (Parker). Bratt was once a former teen star in Hollywood in the 80s who saw his hit TV show cancelled too early. Life imitated art when Bratt turned evil much like his famous character. He swore vengeance on Hollywood for canceling his show and ruining his career.\n\nGru is settling into family life with Lucy, his three daughters, and the gaggle of minions when he receives word of a longtime family secret. Gru learns he has a twin brother named Dru (also voiced by Carell). Gru and his family go visit Dru in his lavish mansion where Dru opens up about wanting to live the villain life like his brother and their father. Gru falls into temptation and joins Dru in his attempt to track down Evil Bratt and find the prized diamond that has been stolen.\n\nThe adults in the audience will be happy to know it runs less than 90 minutes. Despite the short time frame, the story feels a bit stretched out with a few other subplots thrown in to fill the movie out. Scribes Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio have been with the franchise from the beginning, and it feels like even they're running out of ideas. The introduction of Evil Bratt opens the movie and is a great new addition as voiced by South Park's Trey Parker. While I knew it was coming, it seemed to take too long for his story and diabolical nature to be connected to the Gru/Dru story. There was a point where I debated if Dru was secretly working for Bratt to lure Gru in by posing as a fake brother. Maybe that's too convoluted for a kid's movie. The film also takes some time out of that A-plot to give energy to Gru and Lucy's youngest daughter Agnes who is on the hunt for a unicorn. Again, it falls in that sweet and innocent nature that these movies excel at even though it's not all that necessary.\n\nThe Gru/Dru battle against Evil Bratt plays out like a kid-friendly version of a James Bond or Mission: Impossible style movie with the gadgets, amped up cars, secret underground lairs, and action scenes. Little ones will definitely get a kick out of the shenanigans the two brothers get themselves into. They'll be impressed with the cool gizmos and will laugh along with the minions who are back up to their old tricks. They are cute in small doses and don't overstay their welcome in this movie. There's a funny number where the minions are caught unexpectedly on a TV singing competition and end up performing a song from The Pirates of Penzance. It's a nod to Illumination's previous movie Sing from 2016. Kids won't understand the song, but adults may find it funny if they know Gilbert and Sullivan. More adult laughs will come with the references to the 1980s. Evil Bratt dons a mullet, mustache, and some wicked shoulder pads in his purple suit. His weapon of choice is a keytar, and his little army of dolls is named the Bratt Pack. Get it?\n\nI would say this is the best in this franchise since the first Despicable Me. There's just enough creativity with Evil Bratt and the goofy minions to warrant some audible laughs throughout. It's lovely to hear Julie Andrew back voicing Gru's mom, and Trey Parker has fun with Evil Bratt. Pharrell Williams is back with some new songs. He was nominated for an Oscar for \"Happy\", which was featured in Part 2. The end of Despicable Me 3 leaves it open for another entry in this franchise. Is it needed? No, but they could crank out more spy type stories fairly easily if they wanted to keep this going.\n\nIs It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? Mindless entertainment for the kids that won't totally annoy their parents.\n\nRATING: 3 out of 5 TICKET STUBS",

Balthazar has fame and fortune in the 80s as a child star but puberty hits and he is out of favour. Still stuck to his character persona, he become a villain.

            "content": "Well I saw this movie a month ago so my memory of it won't be as fresh as it was then (no really, I have to use the Wikipedia article to help me remember some plot points I may forget) but what I do remember is the feeling that I got out of it. Don't get me wrong I wasn't surprised by what I got since I kind of had an idea from when I saw the trailers but I felt disappointed because what I came to see the movie for was something that was barely there.\n\nThe film does start off kind of promising as it shows Gru (played by Steve Carell) and his new wife Lucy (played by Kristen Wiig) as they chase down 80's themed former child actor turned supervillain Balthazar Bratt (played by Trey Parker) in order to get back some diamond. Their interactions during this chase scene feel kind of organic, sure there's a joke in there that may not work, but eh. Long story short, Gru gets the diamond back, rather hilariously in fact, but he fails to catch Bratt. On their way to the Anti-Villain League (AVL) Headquarters we see more of Gru and Lucy interacting as Gru is ranting to Lucy about how angry he is that he failed to catch Bratt for the umpteenth time. Again it's still nice to see how this unlikely couple from the last Despicable Me interact in this one considering the fact that in the last film their relationship felt so organic and real to me. Although what disappoints me is that it feels like their chemistry lessens which odd considering the fact that the two of them are married.\n\nAnyways they arrive at AVL Headquarters, the director of the organization announces that he's retiring, and the organization immediately gets a new and rather intense \"bad cop\" director who decides to fire Gru after his repeated failed attempts to capture Bratt (with Lucy in tow after she attempts to stand up for him). They then return home where they tell Gru's daughters, Margo, Edith, and Agnes (played by Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Nev Scharrel; the latter of the three replacing Elsie Fisher; respectively) the bad news.\n\nOkay, this is around the point where the film starts to split off into the different subplots of the movie as Gru, already being upset with the fact that Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) froze himself in carbonite (an obvious homage to The Empire Strikes Back, as well as an easy excuse to not have the character in the movie), tells his Minions the bad news, with most of them rebelling after hearing that he refuses to go back to villainy. In short, Gru is trying to find a way to get his and Lucy's jobs back (while hoping to capture Bratt once and for all) while Lucy gets put into this rather cliché plot of struggling to be a good mother for the girls (which is weird considering the fact that in the last movie it seems like she'd do a rather okay job at mothering).\n\nBefore this review basically becomes a plot summary I'll sum this important plot point that happens, some butler dude goes over to Gru's house revealing to work for his twin brother Dru (wow what an original name) and after repeated rejections the butler dude says that Dru wants to meet Gru and have him and his family visit his home country of Freedonia (I'm not kidding, that's the actual name of this country). Gru goes to his mother (Julie Andrews) to ask her whether or not it's true that he has a twin brother and to his shock his mother says yes. Soon the family agrees to meet Dru (also played by Carell) where more clichés and subplots happen.\n\nSo it turns out Dru is incredibly wealthy via a pig farm business, a cover for the real family business of villainy, and he wants Gru to teach him how to be a proper villain since their father, a legendary villain himself, shunned Dru. Of course Gru says no and this leads to this clichéd subplot of the long lost twins bonding via a high tech car. Meanwhile Lucy and the girls are out into town where Edith and Agnes wander into this tavern place in which the encounters lead to like the third subplot where Edith and Agnes decide to go to this forest because a unicorn's supposedly there (I wish I were kidding). Lucy and Margo on the other hand get caught up with this cheese festival thing that causes some boy at a cheese festival to fall in love with Margo.\n\nMeanwhile Bratt manages to steal the diamond again and is planning to use it to wait for it... power a giant robot suit to destroy Hollywood as revenge for cancelling his TV show. It sounds as dumb as it gets, but then again the villains of these movies don't exactly have the best motivations and they all do lose their character halfway through the film, however with Bratt it's much more noticeable. \n\nBut hey, this movie still has plenty of runtime so you want to know what that time should be used for? Another subplot, only this one involves the Minions after their rebellion. Actually I have to admit that I kind of liked this subplot, now the Minions themselves are okay although their over-usage can make them into Jar Jar-esque characters, but their prison subplot was pretty funny, however even it overstayed its welcome and it fell into the same clichés that the other subplots caved into. \n\nAfter some more cliché moments happen between Dru and Gru and some unimportant stuff with the girls and Lucy and their subplots, it all leads to this climax where Bratt kidnaps the girls and goes off to Hollywood and Dru, Gru, and Lucy must go in order to save them. The climax is tacky and cliché but it works out in the end as Bratt is defeated, Gru, the Minions, Dru, Lucy, and the girls are reunited and Gru and Lucy get their jobs back. And so the film ends in kind of a cliffhanger as Dru steals Gru's ship with the Minions in tow and leaves Gru's place with Gru and Lucy giving them a five minute headstart.\n\nSo what do I think of this film overall? It's okay, not great, but okay. I got what I expected but not necessarily what I wanted (for instance Gru and Lucy barely talk in this movie, which severely disappointed me). The animation's still the same colorful and bright kind and the plot's not necessarily the worst. However a lot more could've been explored in terms of character relationships and I do feel that the decline in quality is noticeable in this movie as all of the previous characters are less interesting, weaker versions of their former selves and the new characters being forgettable and kind of getting on my nerves a little (Dru specifically). Also there were too many noticeable clichés in this film that sucked me out of it and many things had long overstayed their welcome. Also no offense to Trey Parker, great guy, but I feel like he was miscast a little in this movie since Bratt sounded like a combination that was predominantly Randy Marsh with little bits of Mr. Mackey and maybe even Mr. Garrison from South Park and I honestly found that very distracting since I couldn't see the villain as anything else other than Randy Marsh. In short for a Despicable Me film this one was probably the weakest one of them all and I feel that those who are truly die-hard fans or are in the under 10 demographic will find something out of this movie however if you are in a more adult or even teenage audience I have a feeling that you won't get much out of it. Also if there's any chance for a fourth film then I will definitely be skipping out on it.",

There were about 6 different storylines in the film. They are all packed together in an hour and a half running time. This made the movie feel disjointed, as it just cut from one story to the other jarringly. Also, I wasn't the biggest fan of the twin brother storyline that is central in the trailers. I felt that it wasn't well developed, and I felt that the brother was just annoying. They could've had some emotional moments from this storyline, but they failed to capitalize on it. I did enjoy some of the Minions scenes. They made me laugh. Overall, I think that kids will definitely enjoy this movie. But parents will probably forget about it pretty quickly.",

His motive is when he was a child, he was a TV show star, but when he grew up Hollywood shut down his show. I wish Gru and Dru somehow showed him that he had to move on from childhood. Also, the B plot is Lucy trying to be a good mother. Throughout the movie she always lets Gru do the serious talking and in the end I wish she did the serious talking, but she just tucks the girls into bed. The plot A is Gru meets his long lost twin brother, Dru. Dru tries to show Gru to be a bad guy so he agrees to help him only to get his old job back. When they had that brother fight it felt so generic. I wish there was a little more to it .And finally the Minions, they were the plot C and they were pretty good.

I had mixed thoughts about how it was gonna turn out. But, when the film finished, I was overall surprised on how well it was all mastered together. Despicable Me 3 is a colorful, and full of laughs and gags, which makes the film excellent. After three films, this film has yet to be the best, picking itself up from the stumble of Minions [2015]. These little-yellow dudes, with the hilarious goggles, prove that this another good Despicable Me. However, not better that the original.",

It begins with amusing and action packed sequences, right on track matching its original for being despises, stunning and colorful visual effects and of course its usual ridiculous fun throughout the entire film. Steve Carell remains perfect as Gru but surprisingly able to handle effectively on Dru with different characteristic at the same time; there is proper character development across the supporting cast and its villain but certainly not further in depth probably to keep the tone simple for understanding of the young audiences.

The minions were the selling point, and they were always amusing and cute with the slapstick humor they pull off. The first two Despicable Me movies were fun to see about a villain turned good who adopted three little girls and tries to save the world for the good guys. This third outing has lost its steam were the plot is no longer engaging, the humor is fewer in between, and at least it still has the colorful entertaining animation. \n\nGru (voiced by Steve Carell) and wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig) are now agents for an Anti-Villain League. While on a mission to stop a villain Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), who was once a huge TV star as a kid about being a very bad boy. Until the audience grew out of it, and his shows were cancelled. He takes over a big ship by using his dance fighting moves, causing him to get away from Gru and Lucy. Meanwhile, the minions are slowly losing interest in their workforce area with Gru. When they are bored with Gru's new goody good lifestyle. While, they all leave for their own and end up walking to a Hollywood studio and trespassing on a singing talent show. Which lands them into prison. Gru receives an unexpected visit from a butler, who informs Gru that his twin brother Dru wants to see him. Shocked that he had a brother. His three girls Margo, Edith, and Agnes convince him that they should all go to see his brother. Gru meets his brother, who brings him back to the world of being bad by stealing from a candy truck and escaping the police. Lucy meanwhile is growing and learning to be a mother of the three girls. \n\nThe characters are what made these movies great. The humor and jokes is small and little in between each scene. The minions were cute and has some small fun moments but nothing memorable like the other movies. The villain Balthazar is also forgettable as the bad guy that keeps reminding everyone he is a bad boy. And always breaking into dancing when doing a heist or dance battling his way out. The minions barely have much to do with the movie as well as they spend time in prison in their comedic scene. \n\nThe third outing in the series may be running out of ideas and creativity before they start becoming easy cash grabs. Like the Shrek series, which became boring at the third movie and out. Same with Ice Age series. \n\nOverall, Despicable Me 3 is a miss and lost its charm that the earlier movies had. The characters were once fun and cute. This film lost its humor, boring plot, and the new additions of Dru and the villain were forgettable. I do recommend the film for the kids which they will still love the characters and find it amusing. But for adults, this one was a bit boring.",

            "content": "Despicable Me 3 (DM3) managed to meet every expectation I had for this movie. I expected some gut-busting laughs. I got that. I also expected some jokes that fell flat. I got that. I expected to love all the voice performances. For the third time in a row, I got that. Luckily the movie isn't quite as despicable as it's previous entry, it also manages to begin strong for about 30-45 minutes and then it ventures into a bowl of nothingness. \n\nIt's no secret that I find Illumination Entertainment to be the worst of what animation studios have become. Instilling almost zero creativity to their projects outside of the Despicable trilogy, and making painfully forgettable animated films. They're a studio that just fails to grasp me as an audience member time and time again. And while I kind of enjoyed DM3 and did enjoy DM1, I just don't see this studio prospering in five years from now unless they include the Minions in every effort. Wow, this is looking frustratingly familiar to my Secret Life of Pets review.\n\nNow, onto the good and the bad of DM3. Well, Balthazar Bratt was utterly, tremendously, hilarious and easily the film's best character. His whole persona had me laughing myself silly on some occasions. The way he talked, acted, and grooved was beautifully brought to life by the voice of Trey Parker. Great job Trey, you were awesome. The first 30-45 minutes of the film really were quite spectacular and I found myself THOROUGHLY enjoying it, but...there's always a but...the last hour is as cold as a villain's evil freeze ray. Before I do get into that passionless hour, the animation and exciting world of Despicable Me always manages to deliver something new to see. This time we get Gru's twin brother, Dru.\n\nAlso voiced by Steve Carrell, Dru and Gru are a blast to watch on screen together. They compliment each other perfectly and provide some of the film's funniest laughs. Even though the film drops in quality after his appearance, Dru and Gru are a diamond in the rough. The minions, surprisingly enough, didn't annoy me at all and had me chuckling at their crazy antics. The minions should have always been a group of side characters, they never should have gotten their own film. \n\nOther than how the first half hour impresses me in delivering to us more of what makes this world so amazing, and expanding that quirky world full of villains and heroes, I'm frustrated with the rest. I *think* that Despicable Me 3 was trying to make fun of modern day superhero films and 1980 supervillains during the last hour, but it didn't work. Especially when you throw in a random subplot of Agnes seeking out a real life unicorn to really screw with the plot of the film. It made everything feel unfocused and annoyingly messy. \n\nThere honestly isn't much else to say about Despicable Me 3. I can already feel myself forgetting most of what happened, most jokes, most plot points, and most of everything. It kind of sucks enjoying a movie in the theater and then realizing that most of what you saw was an unadorned experience. I was prepared to give this movie a positive review, but it really is kind of a pedestrian effort. \n\nDespicable Me 3 gets a 56/100",

When they are fired from work after failing to capture the super villain Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker) they both return home to their adoptive children Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Nev Scharrel). The next day Gru receives a message from his long lost twin brother Dru (also Steve Carell). Gru and the family go to visit Dru and soon enough realize there's more to Dru's immense wealth than what it first seems. The movie isn't bad like I said. It's very predictable though and I will say the pacing near the end gets a bit too slow. The minions are back in this one as well, but are featured as more of a side story. I was hoping for more conflict in the film, but in all honesty there really isn't much. The animation is still top notch and there are some cool action sequences. Kids will love this one while I think older viewers will find this one better than Minions (2015), but still not as good as the first two films!",

Threads are opened and closed quickly, or dragged out too long, leaving the film to suffer from an imbalance of storytelling.\n\nThe cleverness and Minion cuteness balance that existed in the first two are as such gone, and while it will still surely keep fans that are of the proper age, the adults who were able to enjoy it before will be stuck with an hour and a half long slog that serves mostly to advance the commercialization of the Minions.\n\nAlso lost in the move are the girls. Each one had independent characterization, story arcs, and were employed well enough to be adorable and effective before. Not as much now. The sidebar with them and Lucy feels like it goes nowhere, and does nothing to advance the already scatterbrained plot.\n\nThe series would have been best served to end two installments ago, and clearly continues to exist because of the money Universal can make off the Minions.

This third installment in the Despicable Me franchise brings a lot of things to the table that you would expect: Steve Carrell and his funny voice as Gru, the Minions engaging in more shenanigans, a ridiculous villain, and Agnes embarking on a quest to find a real unicorn. And while this stuff isn't bad per se, it also isn't good, making the film overall forgettable and flat.\n\nDespicable Me 3 once again focuses on Gru, voiced by Steve Carrell, a former supervillain working for the Anti-Villain League (AVL) and hunting down a former TV star-turned-villain named Balthazar Bratt. This first sentence is probably the strongest point of the film, as the beginning and end concentrate on these aspects. These were the most entertaining parts of the story. However, the rest of it is pretty \"meh.\" Gru discovers that he has a long-lost twin brother Dru, he and his family fly to Dru's Italy-like country, Lucy makes attempts at being a mother to the three girls, and Gru and Dru work together to take down Bratt. This part of the film was loaded with wasted opportunities and failed attempts at laughs... in fact, I remember myself only chuckling throughout the movie, as it was not nearly as funny as its predecessors. It also wasn't emotionally hefty like its predecessors, and it threw away many chances for depth in its writing, passing it along as half-assed humor.\n\nDespite this, I still wouldn't call Despicable Me 3 \"bad.\" Honestly, \"fine\" is the best word I can come up with to describe it. The film is fine, and that's the truth, but it never shines like you would want it to. The Minions are back, and that's a plus. The animation is still beautiful, and I say that without a doubt. The story still shapes into a fun family adventure, and I imagine kids will still enjoy it.\n\nIn the end, Despicable Me 3 is nothing special. It's fun, yes, but still altogether unnecessary, and a pretty forgettable film. If you're looking for something to see this weekend, I would strongly suggest Spider-Man Homecoming as an alternative: I'll hopefully be seeing that one in the next few days.

The first film was a pleasant surprise and impressed both critics and audiences. I think that the main reason it was popular was because of its main villain, Gru, who is voiced by Steve Carell with a very funny accent. There was also a lot of action as it involved Gru wanting to steal the moon, however, he had a change of heart after adopting three young girls. \nIt made over $543 million at the box office. This lead to its sequel being released three years later and it was just as entertaining as its predecessor. A spin-off film based on Gru's small, yellow Minions was released in 2015 and, despite receiving over $1 billion at the box office, critics were less impressed. Now, the third 'Despicable Me' has been released and, fortunately, it's still a fun and entertaining watch. We meet Gru's twin brother, Dru (also voiced by Carell), who brings a lot of humour with his high pitched and excitable voice.\nThe main villain, Balthazar Bratt, is an improvement over the previous villain as he's funnier due to his huge shoulder pads and love of 80s music. He frequently blasts tunes through his Walkman such as Michael Jackson's 'Bad', Madonna's 'Into The Groove' and A-ha's 'Take On Me'. \nI doubt fans of the previous film will be disappointed with this latest installment.",

            "content": "\"Oh brother indeed, there's another \"Despicable Me\" movie?\"\nMovie Review: Despicable Me 3\nDate Viewed: July 2 2017\nDirected By Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda and co-directed by Eric Guillon\nWritten By Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, Based on characters created by Sergio Pablos\nFeaturing the voices of Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Trey Parker, Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, Nev Scharrel, Steve Coogan, Jenny Slate, Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud and Julie Andrews.\n\nOh brother indeed, there's another \"Despicable Me\" movie? Gru and his minions are back but they don't share much screen this time around. In \"Despicable Me 3\", Gru finds out that he has a twin brother who has hair and he's maybe thinking about going back to villainy and he also goes head-to-head with another international super-villain, he's a former TV child star named Balthazar Bratt (voiced by Trey Parker). He became a super bad guy by simply adopting the same villainous persona he played on TV and he carries machine-guns that shoot out bubble-gum.\n\nThe addition of Trey Parker is refreshing but this animated sequel is far from refreshing. It's just more of same but with subplots that don't go anywhere and less screen time for the Minions. Just like this summer's other mediocre animated three-quel \"Cars 3\", \"Despicable Me 3\" has some breezy stuff but the jokes never land. Following the events of the last film, Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is now an agent working for the Anti-Villain League with his wife Lucy (voiced by Kristen Wiig). After stopping Bratt from nearly stealing a very valuable pink diamond, Gru and Lucy get laid off by the Anti-Villain League's new director Valerie Da Vinci (voiced by Jenny Slate) for failing to apprehend Bratt.\n\nWith no jobs, Gru and Lucy reluctantly tell their daughters about their termination from the Anti-Villain League but they assure them that they will hold new jobs in the near future. Meanwhile, Mel (voiced by Pierre Coffin) and the rest of the Minions leave Gru because he still won't return to villainy. As the Minions hopefully try to find a new villainous master they can serve under, Gru gets approached by a mysterious confidant who tells him that he is the Butler of his long-lost twin brother Dru (who's also voiced by Steve Carell).\n\nUpon hearing this news, Gru and his family travel to the sort of European country known as Freedonia and he's anxious to meet him. When he does finally meet him, Gru is shocked that Dru looks exactly like him but with hair, massive wealth and he has a strange affection for pigs. Dru's fashionably flamboyant personality is way different from Gru's and he really wants to become a major supervillain just like his brother but Gru is reluctant to go back to his villainous ways.\n\nMeanwhile back in America, the Minions get arrested for trespassing a talent show set and all of them get sent to prison. Bratt also manages to retrieve the pink diamond and he intends to use it to power up his giant robot. Once his huge robot becomes active, Bratt will use it to destroy Hollywood as revenge for terminating his show as well as tarnishing his child star image.\n\nDespite it being three Minions better \"Cars 3\", \"Despicable Me 3\" is not one of the better animated films out there. It is a scattershot sequel with (as I said before) subplots that never go anywhere. For example, the eldest of the three daughters, Margo (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove) kisses a chubby kid, he gets smitten with her and then the next day, he tells her that they're engaged and we never hear from him again. The middle daughter, Edith (voiced by Dana Gaier) gets nothing to do, the youngest daughter, Agnes (voiced by Nev Scharrel) gets involved in a silly storyline about trying to find a real unicorn and Lucy worries about not being a good mother to Margo, Edith and Agnes.\n\nCo-directors Pierre Coffin (who also does the Minions) and Kyle Balda never find their footing in this candy-colored and zany universe and they lose track on what made Gru and the Minions so special and hilarious in the first place. Completely out of original ideas, \"Despicable Me 3\" just feels tired and forgettable.",

The ex-star turned villain, Balthazar Bratt being this features most spectacular move, many fantastic references shoehorned into each scene, with the opening montage of Bratt undertaking a heist whilst moving to classic 80s song by no other than Michael Jackson.\n\nHowever, despite the fact each scene with the minions in, specifically the scenes wheres as they are separated from their boss, Gru, are certainly hilarious in every sense, I cannot be helped to think these scenes did not truly belong in this moving (these scenes should've been kept for the opening to Minions 2).\n\nWith yet more bold animations, originality, and more heft and fun comparing to the previous Despicable Me film, it still falls short of Despicable Me (1) and Minions. However, I am very much looking forward to where the franchise goes next.\n\nFinal Verdict  - 6.9/10 or B-",

            "content": "Saw it yesterday July 1, 2017 on it's opening weekend. Despicable Me 3 is obviously the second sequel of the Despicable Me franchise. Before I start this review, I just wanna say that I love the Despicable Me movies. The first one was amazing. The sequel was a step down from the original but was still pretty great. And this one is my least favorite of the franchise but is it any good? Let's find out. Despicable Me 3 is about Gru and his wife Lucy (which he married in the sequel) getting fired by a new boss after letting the child star, now villain Balthazar Bratt accidentally get away again after multiple times. Lucy and Gru have to tell the kids. A few days later, a man shows up to his house to tell him news that he has a twin brother! Gru doesn't believe it at first, but then he finds out his mom kept it a secret his whole life. Gru's twin brother also gets the news and they meet at Gru's twin brother Dru at his enormous house. The kids and Lucy stay there with him. Just by me explaining it, it doesn't sound that fun. But the movie itself is more fun than I'm explaining it. Despicable Me 3 has a main cast as Gru. (Steve Carrel) Lucy (Kristen Wiig) Balthazar Bratt.(Trey Parker) That might be weird to bring Stan from South Park and bring to Despicable Me 3. And Dru. (Steve Carrel again) What I liked about Despicable Me 3 is Balthazar Bratt. He had an 80's tv show as a kid of him being a villain and pretty much who he is now. He was really funny and clever in this movie and was a great villain who is very full of himself. Most of the main characters here from the other movies are great here too. Same animation from the other movies. There are a couple scenes here that are pretty fun especially when the minions accidentally broke into a studio and sang in a national television talent show which they later went to prison for that. No, that is not a spoiler. It is shown in the 2nd official trailer. My negitaves for this movie are that Dru in this movie was kind of annoying. He could've been something great and could've been funny. It sometimes didn't feel as clever as the other two movies. Lastly,  there wasn't really a new great song from Pharrel Willams in this movie. He did make songs like Despicable Me, Fun, Fun, Fun, and Happy didn't in the first two movies didn't he.  Lastly, I need to tell you if the movie was funny. My answer is mostly.",

Grus brother (Dru) was annoying at some points but I enjoyed his stupidity and relationship with his twin brother. Also, the minions weren't as annoying in this movie as they were in previous movies.

Minions never lived up to it's potential, and Despicable Me 2 lost a lot of the fun because when you make Gru a good guy a lot of the fun is lost.  Honestly, I don't really even remember a lot of Despicable 2.  Despicable Me 3 is a bit better, but it still has a lot of the same problems.  To start with what I like, for one it actually feels like the pop culture datedness of it has been toned down a bit.  Maybe I've just become numb to this in movies recently, but I didn't notice it as much in this one.  The main villain has a distinct 80s theme going, but this is tied to his character, and not just a grab at \"hey, this is what kids are into!\" so it actually works.  They don't just do things like have the characters take selfies to be hip.  A low bar but, godamn, I really appreciated it.  I also really liked the climax, because we get to see Gru use his more villainous skills.  It's essentially a heist sequence, and damnit all I'll just never get sick of a heist scene.  Plus, it's a heist scene in the Despicable Me world, and this is a weirdass world they've created, so it was a ton of fun.  I also actually really liked the arc of the minions.  They leave Gru because he's no fun as a good guy (which makes sense, seriously that did always bother me with their characters), and wind up in prison, which they basically take over.  It's weird, but it leads to some really funny stuff.  But this leads to the movies problems.  It's funny, at times it's really funny, but it's largely a series of loosely connected sketches.  There's not a lot that ties it together.  There's a main villain, Gru finding his brother, the minions leaving, Agnes looking for a unicorn, all this stuff happening and all of it is funny but none of it really connects in any meaningful way.  You can put it on, have some laughs, and be entertained, but I don't see it leaving any real meaningful impact.  It's another marshmallow movie.  Light, fluffy, and makes you feel good, but lacking in any real substance.  The one thing I will say is this is the first time I'm excited for a Despicable Me sequel, because without getting into sequels, it feels like they're basically setting up for a Spy vs Spy movie, and I am all about that.",

            "content": "WANT TO SEE REVIEW: The reason why minions wasn't good was because the minions are only good as side characters. Now this will have gru and everyone else back in their own place so this should be good. The first trailer only made me laugh once but it looks like they're saving the funny parts. I say this because they keep showing a tiny bit more funny scenes in each trailer. I'm really expecting a lot from this movie. It certainly looks better than minions. Hopefully the movie keeps a good score. It's 86% at the time I'm writing this.\n------------------------------------------\nMOVIE REVIEW: Despicable Me 3 was actually pretty good. I didn't think it was as good as the first two movies but this was definitely a step up from Minions. It's nice to see the group of characters to come back. This really did show how well they can hold the movie together. This movie worked better than minions because the characters can hold the movie. The minions can't hold their own movie together. Even though the minions can't hold a movie together without these characters, they really do bring some laugh out loud moments. The minions can bring some life to this movie. One problem I found with this movie was just that it was overstuffed. There were a couple of subplots and at times too much going on. And some of the subplots don't go very far. In the end the subplots do manage to stick together with the main storyline though. The new villain in this movie was pretty funny. He brought some new things to the table. Overall I don't think this movie was great like Despicable Me 1 & 2, but this movie really did have some good moments. This movie really showed how important it is to keep the main characters in place. Because, without the main characters, we end up with the Minions movie( which I didn't think was too bad ). I'm just going to give this movie a B.\n-------------------------------\nPros: funny moments, characters are likable, animation looks great, introduces new characters. \n\nCons: overstuffed, too much stuff going on at times\n-------------------------------\nSPOILER ALERT: I don't think I really want to see another Despicable Me movie in a while because now it's starting to get a little old, but one scene in this movie really gave me an idea for Minions 2. Yes they are making a Minions 2. The minions leave Gru and try to find a new master. They end getting into a singing competition and go to jail. Mel, the minion that was pretty much the minion leader, was thinking of Gru. He had flashbacks about how Gru took car of him. Assuming Gru did the same for all the other Minions, Minions 2 could be where the first Minions left off. The minions could be with Gru during his child hood. This could also show how Mel had those flashbacks. Minions 2 could be how Gru grew up with the minions.",

It drags on and on and is not even 90 minutes in length. I am a massive fan of the first installment and even found the second to be a ton of fun. This movie is a massive disappointment to any grown-up fans of this series and is far too childish and uninteresting to recommend. ",

            "content": "You know, when Illumination Entertainment came on the scene seven (!) years ago with the first Despicable Me, they were a breath of fresh air in some ways. Their European humor and old-fashioned slapstick combined with engaging yet accessible characters arcs made for an enjoyable and even rewatchable experience, and I was definitely a fan of it. Their follow-ups ranged from lackluster to awful, though, and the only other movie of theirs that I've enjoyed was Despicable Me 2. Despicable Me 3, however, follows the studios reliance of slapdash material and poor storytelling with no sense of care placed into the concept or execution. It's cynical, disjointed, soulless, and works against its own interests, feeling like a bunch of B stories from different 22-minute television episodes stretched to a withering 90 minutes. An unspecified amount of time after the second installment, this one finds Gru (Steve Carell) and Lucy (Kristen Wiig)-still living together with their adopted daughters Agnus (Nev Scharrel), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Margo (Miranda Cosgrove). They learn from a random man that Gru has a long-lost twin brother named Dru (also Carell), a yang to his yin in a way, and they have to team up to defeat Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), a washed-up former child star from the '80s. Then there are some peripheral stories involving Agnus trying to find a real unicorn, Margo accidentally courting a foreign boy who won't leave her alone, Lucy trying to be a better and more influential mother, and the minions going on strike and running away. None of it really ties together and it feels very inconsequential, almost like a bunch of gags masquerading as actual storylines. The shticks play out just as you would expect, with Bratt's '80s references relying on music choices like \"Bad\", \"Take on Me\", \"Money for Nothing\", and \"Jump\" amongst others. The subplots are slight and their outcomes aren't really containing much gravity as a result, but the beats are as easy to telegraph as the four-chord progression of Bratt's favorite hit songs from decades past. In fact, the film's antagonist feels like a strong encapsulation of the franchise and Illumination Entertainment as a whole: obsessed with an antiquated shtick; convincing of its inability to disappoint; and frustratingly unwilling to evolve because of this. A byproduct of its failure as a movie is that it doesn't inspire much of any discussion or emotion afterwards, which is the cardinal sin of a movie, especially when previous iterations of its characters and plots have demonstrated its content's malleability. This just feels stiff. You can point to the colorful animation as a mild redeeming quality of the movie as a whole, and indeed it is-you can't deny the likability of the designs and colors, which are simultaneously crisp and softened in their designs. I chuckled two or three times, but that's the amount of amusement that should more be elicited from a short film than a feature, and this particular feature happens to feel much longer than its 90-minute runtime. In fact, it's only 83 minutes excluding credits, and while most films would use that to their advantage, the advantage here was in my being able to just barely catch the bus to my apartment without having to wait around. Then I could hear wailing noises that took place in real life! 3.7/10, really bad, D+, far below average, etc.",

The characters (especially new ones) maybe not so well developed. Bratt was a fairly unique villan, but even he maybe could have been developed a little more I would say. The minions were a little more of a disappointment this round. On the plus side, it was something quite different than the first two films, as it should be. This one had a fairly decent concept and a solid music selection, just not executed too well. Felt more like a money-grab than not. 5.5/10.",

And it wasn't even all that entertaining.  So I'm not sure what the point was.  Plus you have to endure some god awful Pharrell songs.  It was bad enough that he unleashed that horrible song \"Happy\".  And who would have thought that the minions were a bunch of dicks.  Guess loyalty means nothing.",
