            "content": "Thor: Ragnarok - A Hilarious Take on the Superhero Genre\n\nGreetings once again from the author. The question that filmmakers face time and time again: how to make the latest comic book movie standout amidst the plethora of others? The answer comes from director Taika Waititi and co-writers Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost, who have created a hilarious screwball superhero action film that not only features the requisite alien war scenes, but also a villain with an unprecedented level of camp that may go down as one of the greatest of all time.\n\nFor those who prefer their superheroes to be brooding and dark, this film may be a surprise. Jeff Goldblum steals the show as the Grandmaster, one of the most polite villains we have seen in recent years, who appears to have stepped out of the 1960s \"Batman\" series. Chris Hemsworth returns as Thor, displaying his impressive comic timing in addition to his Thunder God biceps. The love-hate relationship between Thor and his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is in full force, as is the Bruce Banner and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) banter. It is more reminiscent of GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY than the previous Avengers movies.\n\nHowever, the true standout performance is from Cate Blanchett as the fearsome (yet campy) Goddess of Death, Hela, who is Thor and Loki's long-lost sister and Odin's (Anthony Hopkins) daughter. With an impressive headdress that puts everyone at the Kentucky Derby to shame, Hela is so powerful that she can easily shatter Thor's mighty hammer, reminding everyone that big sisters are known for breaking younger brothers' toys.\n\nAs the title suggests, the story revolves around the possible destruction of Asgard. The film features Idris Elba as Heimdall, Tessa Thompson as the one-liner master Valkyrie, Karl Urban as Skurge - who has a great exit scene, and Ray Stevenson as Volstagg, as well as the voice of director Waititi as the rocky alien Korg. Fans of the series will also be delighted to see familiar faces appearing periodically, including a magical sequence that teaches Loki a quick lesson.\n\nAlong with the main storyline, there are many nods and tributes to previous versions (such as Planet Hulk and Fantastic Four), as well as a hilarious early stage play featuring three cameos that guarantee big laughs. It is also great fun to spot the reunions from other projects such as Star Trek, JURASSIC Park, and Westworld.\n\nSpecial credit goes to director Taika Waititi for taking the comic book film world in a new, comedic direction. He is known for his work on comedies like HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE (one of my favorites from 2016), WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS, and the brilliant but short-lived \"Flight of the Conchords.\" Despite this change in tone, the film is still very much a Marvel movie, with the recognizable marks of Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby present throughout. It is also a thrilling adventure film that sets the stage for next year's AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, with the best use ever of Led Zeppelin's \"Immigrant Song.\" Get ready to rock, roll, and have a great time in a film that offers as much fun as one can have in a movie theater.",

By the end, Loki has fully redeemed himself after years of fighting Thor and its really great to see those two finally fully working together. Hela is an absolutely outstanding villain. Her sheer ruthlessness and power give her an imposing presence throughout the film and her destroying Mjolnir early on makes her seem all the more dangerous and gives the film much higher stakes. The new additions to the cast in Valkyrie and Korg are great as well, providing the movie with an all around excellent cast, rounded out with the Hulk, making for a fun team with great group dynamics that keeps the movie entertaining throughout.",

So pathetic.  Males these days have become extremely weak, thanks to the new feminist upbringing.  Mothers and society grooms boys to be weak and submissive to girls.

It was a little different, but it happened and it worked, and then it made her such a strong character going forward. The comedy was enough because we got to Thor films that were so dark.

            "content": "Thor Ragnarok takes a hard turn from the first two Thor movies. It is amazing the number of actors who return to play their roles, and this is a principle accomplishment of the MCU series. \n\nThis time though, the Shakespearean mantle is removed by director Waititi, with the weighty, dark scenes from Thor 1 and 2 only referred to in the beginning of the film when Thor witnesses a play being performed before Odin. Throughout the movie, the film is poking fun at Thor, the MCU, comic books and the comic book movie genre. \n\nThis humor is appreciated, and I had a lot of fun watching it the first time. Upon a second viewing, the plot started to creak a bit. There is not a lot of logic used, the hulk doesn't connect with the anger he is supposed to maintain to stay 'hulked out' the whole time. The combat seems to have no rules or danger, until it suddenly does.\n\nBut focusing on the plot holes only gets in the way of having a good time, which was the obvious aim with this film. I enjoyed it, it's a good romp, but not much challenge for the mind to think about. Other films in the MCU do a better job addressing something meaningful, even if for just a moment. But this film is fun and bright.",

It's almost a reboot for Thor. The tone is not dramatic anymore, it's now a declared comedy, and Chris Hemsworth only wins with that. Since the first \"Thor\", I've been saying that he's a limited actor in the drama aspect, but he is an excellent comedy actor. He managed to put the comedy above the drama, still does well in the non-funny parts, and all without mischaracterizing Thor. Indeed, this is his best performance as the God of Thunder. Anthony Hopkins' participation is beautiful, Tom Hiddleston is still amazing as Loki, Benedict Cumberbatch has a small appearance, and all of the scientist characters are gone, giving place to the ultra-charismatic universe of Sakaar. Jeff Goldblum is funny as the Grand Master, the dynamic between Thor and Hulk is pure entertainment, Taika Waititi voicing a rock man is joyful, and Tessa Thompson is a \"Thor girl\" (I can't believe I'm using this term) a lot better than Natalie Portman (Valkyrie and Thor don't have a romantic relationship, far from that, but she takes Jane Foster's place as the female co-protagonist). Analysing Cate Blanchett's awarded career, she's one of the last actresses I would cast for the type of villain that she does, but her casting was incredible, not only due to this subversion or to her talent, but also because she incredibly manages to be at the same time threatful and caricature, fitting with the film's tone with perfection. And I can't believe I'm saying that about a film directed by Taika Waititi, a man who never convinced me, and the dramatic moments in his movies were constantly swallowed by the comedy ones. He found the perfect balance here, and I could not be happier. One of the best MCU feature productions.",

Y si, marvel tiene una gran obsecion con caricaturisar a sus personajes más interesantes y poderosos, osea hulk, thor, y loki",

Its about what you'd expect - a decent cast (including, I was surprised to find, Anthony Hopkins - can't say I expected him to be in a Marvel film but there you go. He plays Thors dad, so I guess I saw him in the previous Thor films but I haven't seen those in some time, so I must have forgotten that), great special (visual) effects and lots of action. I've enjoyed the Thor films before because of the characters humour, I suppose a bit like Deadpool only less rude (lol). There is an element of fourth wall present I think. I like films like this that don't entirely take themselves seriously and if your looking for an entertaining watch that you can switch off and enjoy for the CGI, then yes, I'd certainly recommend this film. At times it reminded me of the Tron films.\n\nThere are some less exciting scenes I suppose but its good to have some lengthier dialogue at times for the character development. I suppose its a little long and some may feel it to  be too over the top but its mostly a bit of fun that I quite enjoyed, so I'm giving it a high-ish rate - suffice to say, if Marvel type superhero films are your thing then this will be for you but no doubt, if that's the case, your already quite familiar with it. Oh and also, one final thing - keep watching even when the credits start appearing.",

It took the original narcissistic family dynamic and instead of further breaking away from it put Thor as the narcissist, Valkyrie, Heimdall and that opprobrium Korg thing as the enablers, and once again put Loki as the scapegoat who needs to stomp himself down to receive a scrap of love. This was disgusting to watch, especially because it's hailed as a \"fuck colonialism\" type of movie and then had Odin, THE colonialist, be praised and hailed.

The writing is just flat out lazy for a large part of it. There are wasted scenes executed with extreme mediocrity, such as the death of Odin. There are entire action sequences that are just \"yadda, yadda, yadda\" level phoned in. Hela takes over Asgard in...maybe three minutes? Let's not even pretend there is real character development. Characters are broken until...\"well, it's time for them to not be so...\" It's some of the worst writing yet in the MCU. Still though, if you've never read a Thor comic, and you don't care about quality of story, it will pass the time. I can't give it a negative score, but maybe it's worst to have a neutral one? I know a lot of people praise this, and to be honest I think I know why. Taika Waititi. He's such a great director that everyone wants him to succeed regardless of how bad the quality of story telling is in the case of this film.

            "content": "So we find out that Thor has an elder sister who is the goddess of death and wishes to kill them all if they do not bow down to her. Hella, the hidden sister, is played well by Cate Blanchett.\n Ragnarok, or end of days, is referred to in this movie as the end of days for Asgard. Of course, Loki, the trickster is alive, making his tearful death in the previous film now irrelevant. \nAnd we find Hulk, now on Planet Sakaar hailed to all as the Grand Champion. And the Grand Master is none other than Jeff Goldblum. \nThe only gripe would be with the Valkyrie – an actress of color portraying a Norse character. To put it into perspective, in this current day and age, Norway has less than 2% who are African heritage. So back in the days of yore, the only men and women were white and mostly blonde. How does a black woman attain such an honour? I would really not mind if it had been an actress of acclaim or someone with better acting skills or even someone with a better back story than \"I was almost killed by Hella once so now I commit treason by turning my back on my duty and show young girls it's okay to be stupid drunk all the time, so much in fact that I pass out\". After all, Heimdall was portrayed by Idris Elba who, in my opinion is a class actor, so much that I don't mind a race-swap in James Bond if he plays it. Idris Elba clearly became a fan favorite for not just myself but a whole lot of others. Yet this actress who plays the Valkyrie has no prior street-cred to her name and it remains to be seen if she will become popular with the MCU among fans. Also along lines of diversity, I read that they were trying to make this character bisexual – something that didn't show up in the film and thankfully so. \nThen we have the great Anthony Hopkins who reprises his role as Odin, perhaps for the last time. That definitely adds a touch of class. And Karl Urban does a great job as Skurge, and to see him who is a survivor, choose to right path even when he knows it will lead to his doom, is sublime. \nOf course, if you thought that the actors in the Thor/Loki play in the beginning of the movie look familiar, then you are quite right. Matt Damon and Luke Hemsworth have cameo roles as Loki and Thor play actors. Yup, Stan Lee also has a role as always, happy to re-design Thor's hairstyle. \nThe movie completely destroys what we now know of Asgard, there is no Odin, no Thor Hammer, no Rainbow Bridge and no Asgard. While the paradigm shift is drastic, its repercussions will only be felt in the later movies of the MCU. \nAll in all, a pretty good movie even though it seems to add a feeling of finality to the rich background of Thor, namely Asgard, his family and Asgardian comrades and friends. The story was tightly written, the action was strong, the humour in between was well-timed and the new supporting cast added depth to the story.",

Hemsworth is still great in the role.\nLoki has less to do than in the previous movies and has somewhat of an arc, but he lacks any standout moments like in the past films.\nHela works for the film as an unredeemable menace to our heroes. Maybe the only live action female villain that Disney didn't feel the need to try and make sympathetic and I can appreciate that.

It has two good villains that are completely different from each other in Grandmaster and Hela. It brings together the two strongest members of the Avengers, Thor and Hulk, to fight side by side. It is overall a very bright and colorful movie, that looks out of place when put next to the previous two Thor films. It isn't without its issue though as the movie feels like two entirely different films were pieced together, which does lead to some strange tone shifts at times, and both storylines are interesting with the Asguard storyline seeming to suffer due to time constraints. Overall Thor Ragnarok is a very important movie and explains where Hulk and Thor were during the events of Captain America Civil War. I highly recommend going back and watching this movie again, but it can probably be skipped if doing only the essentials of rewatching the Marvel Cinematic Universe in preparation for Endgame.",

Hemsworth is at the peak of his comedy, Loki has a great character arc, Hulk is a welcome face and Korg and the Grandmaster are scene-stealers. Hela is a far more powerful, intimidating and convincing villain than Malekith was, and she's a formidable foe to our heroes. Ragnarok perfectly balances comedy with sadness and seriousness and goes a great job of not squandering it's A-list lead and supporting cast as it gives every substantial character moments to shine. There are a few nice callbacks to previous MCU installments, but the thing about this movie that stands out is how entertaining it is considering that the stakes are decently high. Ragnarok is a movie that wants to have as much fun as possible considering its premise, and it succeeds in doing so in every regard. It delivers in every way that fans would want for a third installment, but it also fundamentally changes the Thor franchise and takes both it and the character in new directions that they badly needed. The mid-credits scene nicely and smoothly ties the movie back into the bigger universe and timeline with disrupting the flow of the movie.

The cameos of strange doctor stphen, the thanos ship and the HULK. In this movie he shows the real thor he is not a guy who is defined only by his hammer and with a life earned but in this movie he showed who the real thor is he is just a god who wants to improve the world and become the thunder god. The ships are well mannered, reminiscent of star wars and star trek. The Valkyrie that is a beautiful representation of women in geek culture. The sarcastic loki as always.

            "content": "After the release of Infinity War, I had begun bingewatching all the MCU movies. And I'm not gonna lie to you. I wasn't feeling like watching this movie. After seeing Thor and Thor: The Dark World, I had taken the assumption that Thor movies are always bleak and lifeless. They always try to be serious when they can't possibly do it when they have characters like Thor, Loki and Odin. And so when it was time for me to watch this movie I was very reluctant, because I knew I can't skip it. But I'm glad I sat through this movie, because it was a huge improvement.\n\nThe movie started out in Asgard, from the point where Thor: The Dark World left (and honestly the only thing I remember about that movie). The way that movie had ended, I had thought this movie would build more on Loki pretending to be Odin. But that ended immediately. Instead this movie focuses on Thor and Loki's estranged sister Hela, who had been abandoned by Odin at a young age. She easily manages to defeat both Thor and Loki and sends them to exile on Sakaar, with Thor reaching the planet two weeks after Loki. That was the part where the movie skyrockets the interest. I like everything about it movie from a cinematic point of view - the CGI, the acting, the comic timings, the story, the dialogues. Everything is absolutely perfect. I could undoubtedly say that this is one of, if not the best superhero movies which is not an origin story but rather a continuation of events. The comedy of the arc is the selling point. My favourite dialogue was the rock guy saying, \"I planned to start a revolution but didn't publish enough pamphlets so hardly anyone turned up.\"\n\nAfter Thor, Loki, Hulk and Valkyrie come back to Asgard to stop Hela we get the best CGI ever witnessed with Thor. I really like how his eyes glow whenever he has to shoot lightning. I always wanted him to be like that. Thor really had a very drastic character development. I know many people have said this - he lost his father, learnt about his sister, his friends were killed, his precious hair was cut by none other than Stan Lee himself, he continuously got taken down by Valkyrie and lost against Hulk, his entrie planet got blown up and his people encountered Thanos in space. And yet this was the funniest MCU movie yet. And not just Thor, every scene that had Loki in it was always interesting too.\n\nHowever, this movie was obviously not without its set of flaws. For starters the elephant in the room, the amount of exposition that was given throughout the movie was too much, with most of it never being mentioned any time afterwards. There was even a scene where Thor is explained everything about Sakaar on a virtual trip, but it was never talked about afterwards nor was it necessary. If it wasn't for this unnecessary padding of runtime, I'd have given it 5/5. The Planet Hulk arc was also quite unexplored from the comics, and it would have been great if they made a spinoff movie on Hulk also since Hulk has never been given a solo movie starring Mark Ruffalo. Then the biggest plot hole, Valkyrie electrocuting Thor also didn't make sense since Thor is literally the God of Thunder and he shoots lightning from his hands. And then when Hela pins Thor he gets the ex-machina of his father telling him about his superpowers.\n\nThor: Ragnarok is an excellent MCU movie. It's kinda sad that this can't be enjoyed unless you've watched Thor: The Dark World and Avengers: Age of Ultron. Because it could have really been cool to show to someone who has no idea what the MCU is all about. It does have the good reward to it, since you can watch Avengers: Infinity War after it. And the tone of this movie is so flexible that even the grim Infinity War completely suits in being its sequel.",

I love pretty much about every aspect of the story. And the visuals were just drop dead memorably gorgeous. My favorite scene is with Valkyrie and her backstory. It's just the most visually appealing, and it just looks like it's from a painting. The only problem that I have with this movie that it is a bit too much of a good time. This movie is trying too hard to be funny, which it is and it's good. But it does need a few moments just to breathe just a little bit. Not too much, but enough to make us feel more emotion.

If Natalie Portman doesn't bring her A-game to Love and Thunder, (which she didn't to the first two) I'd like to start a petition that Tessa Thompson takes her place (without the horrible Valkyrie outfit). \n\nCate Blanchett rips it as Maleficent (er, I mean Hela). I love the way she just makes Karl Urban her boy-toy. Without her guidance would he really have manned up and jumped out of a space ship double wielding machine guns?!?!\n\nThe majority of the action and dialogue scenes with Hulk proves the point that the Hulk is SO much better as a supporting character than. \n\nLastly, is there a better song to go with an action sequence than Led Zeppelin's \"Immigration Song?\" If so, I can't think of one.",

I really had a hard time ever taking anything seriously because there was a constant barrage of stupid jokes every 30 seconds.  The only real positives I can think of were Heimdall, who was very good as usual, and a couple decent moments from Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner.  I did not care for Valkyrie at all, her character really just bothered me truly.  All in all, I really struggled to even make it through this whole movie without turning it off.  I really wanted to like this movie, having heard almost exclusively positive things about it, but I could not.  It isn't even just that it is a humorous movie in the MCU, because I genuinely love both Guardian's of the galaxy movies.  It was just a bad movie, in my humble opinion.  Would not recommend.",

Bring on 'Thor: Love and Thunder'!\n\nChris Hemsworth is quality in the lead role, I found him super enjoyable in this second sequel. Big fan of his new hairstyle, by the way. This is also the most I liked Tom Hiddleston in an MCU film. Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett and, particularly, Tessa Thompson are fab additions. Shoutout to (director, as well!)

Through I enjoyed the two previous movies, I could acknowledge that in many instances ( the entirety of \"Dark World\" ) Loki outshined Thor. I'm happy to say that in this movie that is NOT the case. Thor and Loki bounce off of each other perfectly, in a way that was not seen before. The way this movie looks is also GREAT. In \"Dark World\" and the first Thor film the color grading was grainy, generic, and borderline boring. The third installment in the Thor franchise adds scenes bursting of color and the sound track is absolutely AMAZING. This movie is perfection in my eyes.",

            "content": "I absolutely loathed this film! It deserves no stars. All the male stars are turned into himbos, with the exception of Elba and Asano. \n\nChris Hemsworth‘s comedy here is indistinguishable from his MIB film, or Ghostbusters characters. It's that bland and horrific, you could literally interchange the characters and it wouldn't effect the film. \n\nI realize that the second film, Thor the Dark World was a mess, but this was worse because it was intentional. It deconstructed the hero's journey the first Thor film put the character on. It gave the character no growth, but regressed him and those around them simply to make fin of them. Where as the first movie was situational comedy, this one was making fun of the characters by making them imbeciles. \n\nHemsworth has been on a comedy kick ever since his Ghostbusters role. It's not that he hadn't done comedic roles prior to it, but it created a bug in him. He insisted on doing more comedies, but kept doing the same chAracter in each of those new comedies, and the movies suffered for them. He's a talented actor, who is capable Of doing comedy, but he's gone off the rails recently with the type of comedy and the directors he's worked with. \n\nTaika Waititi I'm not a fan of, and this is a piece of work that never should've come to pass. As I've said it's cheap laughs at the characters expense that deconstructs all the progress the characters had previously made. And the mixed mythological elements such as toga wearing Asgardians makes me wonder if he's that ignorant of the mythology? Or that uncreative as a comedic director. \n\nThe writers Kyle and Yost I usually enjoy, but here I despised them. Where the first movie relied on situational comedy, a man out of his element or time; this film made Thor and the majority of the male characters stupid. Other marvel films used comedy to great effect, but the characters were never the butt of the joke, not even when Captain America became America's ass. \n\nSee it if you want, if you like it good for you, as for me I'm looking to hire Lacuna Inc To erase my memory of ever having watched this pos.",

Thor fights the hulk in a cage match and Tessa Thompson is there. Thor tells a great story about Loki turning into a snake and stabbing him, and Jeff Goldblum is there playing himself. Overall pretty good and much better and more exciting than the other avengers. Also in this movie it is extremely clear who the bad guys are, unlike in the last Thor movie where Thor was kind of the bad guy and everything was blue toned for no reason. In this movie they just pretend the last Thor movie never happened and get to the good stuff.

Thor is my favorite character in the Marvel cinematic universe. The reason is that his weapon called Mjolnir looks cool and the power based on natural phenomena looks cool. It is because they can use their ability in most of the situation. Let's turn back to this movie. There is two previous series movie called Thor (2011), Thor: The Dark World, (2013). I mostly satisfied when I watched the movie right after it released in the movie theater. However, there was something make me unsatisfied, there are two kinds of things. The first thing is the background of the movie was only Asgard and Earth. And another thing is the movie's content was not very faithful to the original Nordic mythology. This movie satisfied a little of the complaints I had in this series. There is another background in this movie called Sakaar. And it is a quite interesting place I have ever seen in the Marvel cinematic universe. I think the Sakaar scene helps us to focus on the movie quite better. There is a new character such as Hella and Surt which is based on Nordic mythology. Also, they are highly related to Ragnarök in Nordic mythology. Their role is quite different, and their story is different from original mythology. However, it will be acceptable to most people. And there is one more advantage. It is a soundtrack. There is a lot of great soundtrack in this movie especially there is EDM music which is quite interesting. For these reasons I highly recommend this movie.",

            "content": "Thor has never been the easiest character to integrate in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In a world dominated by the science and reason of Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, we now had to jump into a land of trolls, giants and Gods. The contrast seemed hard to digest, but the makers of the first THOR movie had the brilliant idea to adhere to Arthur C. Clarke's third law: ''Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic''. Hence, Asgard is not as much a realm of Gods, but a race of aliens that have been mistaken for Gods in their early Earthly visits.  Something also pretty much right out of the pages of Erich Von Daniken's CHARIOTS OF THE GODS. A brilliant move.\n\nKenneth Branagh  was a logical choice in many ways to direct that first installment, as his familiarity with Shakespearean prose made him a natural in this throne room family drama between the wise King Odin, the tempestuous unworthy son Thor and his devious half brother Loki.The film had its weaknesses (including a rather obvious set for the surprisingly small town where a lot of the action takes place), but Australian Chris Hemsworth's considerable charm shone through and made for a sympathetic God of Thunder and an instant star. Add a magnificent score by Branagh regular Patrick Doyle and you had a potent addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nTHOR: THE DARK WORLD was less successful.  A bit glum, and featuring an astonishingly bland performance by Dr. Who alum Christopher Eccleston, the film never rose much above an uninspired plot and direction by Alan Taylor who must have felt overwhelmed by stepping away from his usual TV productions. Not a bad film by any stretch, it still remains a low point in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nThis time, Marvel went to Kiwi director Taika Waititi who had demonstrated a great sense of humour in films like the hilarious mockumentary What We Do In The Shadows, and the uproarious Hunt for the Wilderpeople. So one could safely assume that this new adventure of the ''Lord of Thunder'' would also include a healthy dose of comedy. And one would assume rightly. Taking a hint from the wildly popular GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY films, THOR RAGNAROK is an outright comedy from the very first scene where Thor confronts the fiery Surtur, to the very last post credit scene. And the result is a bit of a mixed bag. While it makes the film one of the most enjoyable and gleefully entertaining  Marvel film to date, the humour at times impedes on the proper dramatic impact of certain scenes that have a lot of potential emotional weight to them. There is a cataclysmic event taking place near the end of the feature, for instance, that is almost spoiled by, appropriately enough, director Waititi in his Korg persona. The joke is funny, but takes away from the potency and significance of the scene. \n\nIt's as if Waititi is unable to extract himself from the intrinsically silly nature of comic book lore. Because whether we like it or not, there is something  profoundly ridiculous in stories about flying men, jade skinned brutes and Thunder Gods. That state of mind does serve him well for most of the film, eliciting laughter on many occasions. It also unabashedly refers to previous comedic moments in the previous Marvel films, to great effect. There was already potential for greatness in THE AVENGERS' first pairing of Hulk and Thor, as was hinted in one of 2012's funniest singular moment at the movies. \n\nThe film makes great use of that chemistry, aided by Hemsworth gift for comedic timing and Mark Ruffalo's refined gruntings. The superhero team-up, occurring after Thor's accidental landing on planet Skar where a stranded Hulk has thrived as a gladiator champion under the tutelage of the Grandmaster (a hilarious Jeff Golblum just being Goldblum), is pure comedy Gold.\n\nMeanwhile, back on Asgard, Hela, the Goddess of Death (a formidable Cate Blanchett), who has been freed from the Underworld, is starting to lay waste to the Golden Realm. Hela has captured my imagination ever since I first saw her on a terrific John Buscema cover back in the early 70s.\n\nHela's considerable power is well manifested in her hostile takeover of Asgard and her destroying Thor's ubiquitous Mjolnir. However, her character never demonstrate one of her most terrifying comic book ability in the film, in what could have been a grisly scene. \n\nBut her character remains truly formidable nonetheless, and a flashback scene showing her confrontation with the fabled protectors of Asgard, the Valkyries, remains one of the most strikingly beautiful scene ever put to film...\n\nWhich brings us to another valuable player in the film, Thessa Thompson's Valkyrie, the drunken, disgraced lone survivor of this attack against Hela. Her character is a strong, funny and charismatic addition to the Marvel Universe, and I cannot wait to see her in action again. Her appearance is a striking departure from the comic book origin, but I cannot say that it is a bad thing, for many reasons.\n\nWhen I first saw the trailers for the film, I was extremely pleased to see Karl Urban as Skurge, in what seemed like a retelling from the character's dramatic final moments from the outstanding Walt Simonson's run of Thor in the eighties. Skurge (AKA the Executioner) had been a longtime Thor villain, who ended up having a change of heart and saved Asgard in an heroic confrontation with a horde of ghastly enemies.\n\nWaititi reprises this famous scene in the film, but the character arc is sadly not as powerful as in the comic book, and while the scene still remains quite strong, it never reaches the emotional, iconic nature of the source material.\n\nThe big surprise of the film is Mark Mothersbaugh's score. A bit like Danny Elfman surprised everyone in 1989 with a BATMAN score that strayed miles away from his Oingo Boingo days, Mothersbaugh hits epic orchestral highs with memorable, gorgeous melodies, all the while making numerous musical references to his DEVO origins. A thoroughly enjoyable score with moments of eighties retro electronic bliss. And one cannot talk about the music for this film without mentioning the pitch perfect use of Led Zeppelin's THE IMMIGRANT SONG in two key scenes.\n\nOne last note about the design work in the film. I was overjoyed by the obvious Jack Kirby influence in costume and set designs, especially on Planet Skar. Kirby created the comic book version of the Thunder God back in 1962 with Stan Lee (who by the way, as another of his ubiquitous cameo in the film), and it is pure happiness to see the colourful, angular sensitivities of the King of comics applied so beautifully on the giant screen.\n\nOverall, THOR RAGNAROK is a highly enjoyable film, that will never bore the viewer, and makes drastic changes to the Thor mythos that will impact the Marvel Universe in no uncertain ways. If you like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this will be another must in your collection. If you are tired of Superhero films, the comedic aspects and self deprecating humour may manage to sway you in the right direction again. Some may be weary that the Marvel films are turning into comedies, but trailers for BLACK PANTHER and early words on the next AVENGERS films may lay those fears to rest.",

            "content": "Thor: Ragnarok, directed by Taika Waititi, created this breath of fresh air, being undoubtedly, the best installment to the Thor series. You can tell that Taika had a great respect and bond with the returning cast members, seamlessly working together on this exciting tale. Waititi did an amazing job adapting his multi-genre style into this film, but the fact that he tried to keep it in continuity with the Marvel style, it didn't really fit all that well; If Waititi made this film with strictly his style, it would've paid off better, grasping what made Guardians of the Galaxy a great film.\n\nEven though Waititi played things a little safe, while the premise is overused and predictable, he brilliantly switched up the whole narrative, doing his best to make this an original and entertaining film. Thor: Ragnarok, was so much fun, while really embracing the weirdness the saga poses. The film flows at such a brisk pace, that can be laidback at times, while having so many memorable moments. Waititi created this film to be more of a comedy-based film, but the other darker tones he incorporated worked pretty well, although some of the dramatic scenes were played off a little light.\n\nThor: Ragnarok stands out so much because of the characters! Sarah Finn did another amazing job casting this huge talent! You can genuinely tell that everyone was having a good time, which translates to great performances across the board! Chris Hemsworth is a stud! He brings so much wit, humor, and heart to the Thor character, being able to create chemistry with anyone! The writers gave him everything he needed to make his character more likable, while giving him some nice character development. We finally get to see Mark Ruffalo back in action as Bruce Banner and The Hulk, and he absolutely steals every scene that he's in! Ruffalo was born to play this character! He brings a tremendous likability to the character, bringing so much wit, and subtle humor, to give his character more great layers! Ruffalo can fit any scheme that he's thrown into, being such an enjoyable presence everytime. Tessa Thompson gets thrown into the MCU mix, and she is another one that fits the scheme like a glove! She is such a fantastic addition to the saga, while putting on such a natural performance, here. Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki, but he doesn't have too much to do in the film, because of his antics in the past. Believe it or not, he is more mellowed out, and grounded this time around, also having some nice character development. One of the most favorable additions to the film, was Korg, voiced by Taika Waititi. He didn't have much to do up until the end of the third act, but he was just an enjoyable presence, having some great jokes along the way! Karl Urban as Skurge, was fine, but he wasn't one of those characters that needed to be there, especially due to the fact that he's just a jerk. Urban definitely made the best out of his screen time, having a few decent moments, but he isn't the most memorable out of the cast. You probably wouldn't expect to see Jeff Goldblum in the MCU, but him as The GrandMaster was awesome! The way his character was written was perfect for the tone of the film! Even though he didn't have a whole lot of screen time, he made the absolute most of it! Cate Blanchett may have overcooked her performance a tad, but she was still great as Hela. She is one of the better villains of the MCU, having a good motive, and connection to Thor and Loki. One of my only issues with Hela, she could've been fleshed out better, instead of throwing a lot of exposition at us. There is a lot to be explored about her character, so it's understandable to an extent, but it left her character to be a little boring, at times.\n\nThe screenplay by Craig Kyle, Christopher Yost, and Eric Pearson, had a lot of good pieces of writting, with a great flow and timing, but some of the dramatic aspects were cut a little thin, due to the comedy-heavy genre. The film would've benefited if they would've cut back on the comedy just a little bit, to tighten up the emotional and dramatic aspects; other than that, there isn't much to complain about.\n\nThe production of this film was gorgeous! There were so many beautiful colors, with unique world designs. The effects of the film weren't the best it could've been, but it worked a lot better than something like Black Panther. The action of the film was one of the best aspects, being well balanced, well shot, and really entertaining! The score and soundtrack wasn't the orthodox score from the MCU films; Waititi and Mark Mothersbaugh incorporated this rock anthem, and it just worked perfectly!\n\nOverall, Thor: Ragnarok is one of my personal favorite MCU films. Even though this blast of fun comes with issues, Thor: Ragnarok belongs close to the top of your list!",

            "content": "This was my least anticipated Marvel movie of 2017, but it turned to be the absolute best. I, like many others, did not like the Thor franchise at all. Thor was okay, and Thor: The Dark World was atrocious. Thor was not a bad character, but his personality wasn't very interesting, and the movies suffered because of the directors insisting that they needed to go to Earth. To me, it seems like the previous directors of the Thor franchise were trying to make a movie, but created certain guidelines, such as the need for a love interest, a serious and Shakespearean tone, and to go to Earth enough to make it feel more relatable, and not like a cosmic adventure with gods and aliens. But for the third Thor movie, Taika Waititi came in and just asked a simple question: Why? And he scrapped all those elements and made a crazy and hilarious movie. And it worked like a miracle. Taika Waititi was the miracle needed to save the Thor franchise. Thor: Ragnarok is the most hilarious movie in the MCU, but it works. Finally, in this movie, it seemed like Marvel nailed the character of Thor. Thor is supposed to be funny, and he works best when he is. Hela is an amazing badass villain and has clear motivations and poses a serious threat to the heroes. The action is also cool. I loved the Thor vs. Hulk fight and wished it had continued on longer. And the final battle was epic. But despite almost everything being played for laughs, it still succeeded in getting its themes across and made sure not to play those for laughs. All the scenes with Odin were not funny for a reason. The messages of Asgard being a people, and of Thor's power coming from within were amazingly well done. And having Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song play during the final battle was he best possible combination of story and music. Lightning and Led Zeppelin: a perfect combination. This movie also did the best job showcasing Thor and Loki's complicated relationship. And of course, Thor finally learns that sometimes, people like Loki just can't be trusted. The irony is that this movie actually has the darkest story of all the Thor movies. Thor 1 was about an arrogant god losing his powers and being betrayed by his younger jealous brother. Thor 2 was about some guy trying to destroy the universe for some reason we never get to know. But Thor 3 is actually a political satire, including many elements like propaganda and secrecy, showing that Odin was not a nice and loving person at all. He looted and conquered many worlds and ruled them all for himself. Thor and the Asgardians didn't seem to realize that the gold and luxuries on Asgard were all tainted with blood and slaughter. Every drop of gold was a representation of the lives Odin and Hela took. If one of the previous directors had directed this, it would be a disaster. They would make it dark with many political themes. They would basically try to make it like Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which would be ridiculous, because Thor is not Captain America, they are two completely different characters. But because of the tone of the movie Taika sets, you don't even realize you're watching a satire. This is an amazing movie and truly one of Marvels best.",

The only thing I can think of that I didn't like, was Hela. She was an OK villain all around. She seemed to come out of left field, and it was wasted potential. A lost sister villain could have been so cool, if only the filmmakers allowed it to be just a little more serious and scary.

            "content": "Thor Three is very much What We Do In The Shadows with capes. Wait, it did have capes in it. Well, you take my point.\n\nDespite its adherence to the kooky, sometimes slapstick, sometimes realistic, always offbeat, kiwi humour, Ragnarok is also an out and out true fantasy; much more so than Guardians of the Galaxy with its space opera chops, Ragnarok delivers cloaked exiles trekking refugees across lush landscapes, fights inside trippy rainbow light bridges, posturing enthroned becrowned fire demons, the severed head of a gigantic guardian dragon, prog rock album art cover shots sprinkled liberally throughout and Mark Mothersbaugh's delicious score that flipflops between 80's nostalgia synth and Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings. The lack of distinction between the magic and science mentioned in the first Thor movies finally lives up to the magic side of things; the opening and closing title logos almost as good as the film itself, not to mention the comic-con announcement/trailer typeface, all promising a coin-op arcade cabinet of a film that was eventually, actually, delivered.\n\nThor: Ragnarok is a good example of liberal canon and yet also, about evolution of character; Thor, a waning, one-note, foppinsh, stiff do-gooder needing to find a new throughline above the macho sycophants and narcicists that rule the Avengers world. As such we're given an impressively short time on Earth and instead given a micro and macro level view of the workings of the planet Sakar, repurposed here from Planet Hulk to give us a greatest hits skim over deeper, more creative comic bokk source material. But the characters are allowed time to bond here; Thor's way of dealing with Banner and Hulk are hilarious and realistic, the idea that The Avengers just end up using each other is touched upon nicely here the film is allowed to explore the only superpowered Avenger who isn't pretending to be someone he's not. He's a hero and he bloody well knows it through and through, he doesn't have to put on a suit because his Dad didn't love him, he doesn't have to fight his darkside through Gamma exposure, he has to convince and rally those to the cause of good, only to discover (see Ragnarok) that it was good for him to do nothing. He can't fight nature, death and rebirth, because it is the universe. It's all these even if it is hidden, which makes a refreshing change.\n\nThe film does have a problem with zipping all over the place like a saturday morning cartoon in its effort to (admirably) resolve a bunch of cameos and scenes from previous unrelated Marvel entries, but I suppose it's a refreshing twist to see the entire end credits sequence featuring Doctor Strange played out in full here, it almost feels like the most solid link between disparate films they've crafted yet.\n\nThe film veers in to slaptick a little too often but when it is let off the leash to be full badass, my god does it go full badass: Thor actually using his lightning powers to decimate his foes; John Wicking his way through Draugrs and using his hammer to flee dirty great creatures and the clearly videogame-influenced ship battles involving characters jumping from ship to ship to disable them directly. A wholly appropriate smattering of Led Zeppelin got my fist and heart pumping and a smirk on my face that said: \"Well done Thor Ragnarok, well played.\"\n\nBut the fact that this film is having so much fun and invites you along to have it too, only makes the misfires all the more bitter: Take Tessa Thompson for example, there's no doubt she was having fun, but her acting style of looking smug and fighting with a truly distracting and hard to understand BRITTOSH(tm) accent, was only the icing on the cake for her character who had no proper catharsis and no moment of a real ending or closure to her story. The fact that she was hired in as the kick-ass female(tm) and not warranted properly and woven in properly cheapened her immensely.\n\nAlso missed is all the weight and depth and aching, ponderous beauty from Hulk and co. from Planet Hulk - It wouldn't be hard to shoehorn it in to a later entry, but losing Meek and his history and personality from PH and the relationship between Korg and Hulk in PH were particularly standout in comics and were weak here. I suppose there was the faintest hint of the relationship between Valkyrie and Hulk/Banner but it misses some of the most beautiful and impactful nuances of the romantic relationship of PH.\n\nI also think more time and attention could have been spent on some of the CGI. Because Taika stages the extras and physicasl backgrounds so well, Asgard has never felt so real unlike most of the other Marvels that suffered from acute greenscreenitis. The CGI background work and sets are generally excellent which means sore thumb sequences such as CGI Hela fighting off the hoardes reminded my of Matrix Reloaded's plasticky blandness, and some of Hulk's moments were played far away with emphasis on acting and movement, leaving a lingering desire to want to see a few close ups of Hulk talking to build a stronger sense of connection and to tame my curiosity as to how they made this Hulk tick.\n\nOne of the stronger aspects is the strong, almost resolution, to Loki's story. He is the brother in this film and the story deserves him, unlike The Dark World, and it deserves to explore brotherhood in it considering their connection to Hela. Hela is given enough to do, is charismatic enough and has motivation and backstory etc etc but she ends up being mixed bag. Due to the speed and globetrotting nature of the film, she feels like an immovable object, taking 90 minutes to make her way from the rainbow bridge to the warehouse of antique relics. Had she been employed as someone in the way of their journey and not just waiting for them to get back the way Guardians 2 managed to do, it might have not felt like a film of two halves.\n\nAnthony Hopkins is another symptom of the film playing catch up with the decisions of prior titles; he starts strong, but really, he's Loki at that point, and when he's himself he is detached and is glossed right over. The emotional side never plays out properly and the best parts of the film's themes are left unexplored. The colonial idea that Odin paid for the vast beauty of Asgard with his bootheels over the countless other worlds is a fascinating and a surprisingly obvious one. It came out of leftfield, but was not unwelcome and tied directly to the titular Ragnarok, smacking nicely of the Crusades. It was powerful and smart but it left Odin unaccountable as he turned in to gold dust and disappeared, there's not enough running time or clever scripting to have Thor or Loki deal with the fact that their empire and their father dealt in so much bloodshed. Maybe if his parting speech made more sense in retrospect instead of being wishywashy forgettable claptrap.\n\nHowever. When a film make a conversation about a vampire stake weapon so deftly that I can't breathe through the laughter, or when Thor waxes about how much he loved snakes and how Loki played a prank on him as children that's so funny I think I'm going to die. When cameos are so brazen and stupid they feel like they belong in Anchorman not Marvel's throwaway Avenger, then the film manages to fully and wholly redeem itself.\n\nThe films goofy charm is awash with 80's music and glam rock villains and it's no small feat for it to be, for me, the film I wanted Guardians to be when I first watched it. It's the film I like as much as everyone else seemed to like Guardians. Ragnarok isn't as emotional, but I like it more. I liked the Hulk/banner transformation that stirred me, I like that its influences and taste are less crass and more kiwi, and it wasn't the plethora of slapstick humour that kept me laughing alone, it was the conversational, humanising dialogue amidst this alien, fantastical world. And the fantastic array of acting doing its best to make it the most unique entry in to Marvel's machine. And its Taika's little details, the use of Pure Imagination, the destruction of all the hero tropes in to childish, playing-action-man-with-your-mates moments, that prove that a strong director can push past the Marvel factory and yet still play ball enough not to get fired ceremoniously or unceremoniously.\n\nThor: Ragnarok:\n\nIt's fist pumping hero action. The third act is fun, doesn't feel out of place, comes at the right time and flows well. It's a blink and you miss it, eye popping, influences on its sleeve, side-splitting, niche humoured blockbuster and it's highest compliment is it embodies its themes; it is true franchise Ragnarok: destruction of the known and previously seen, to facilitate a rebirth, of relationships, of what a visionary can bring, of what a film should strive to be, a rebirth of good blockbuster cinema.\n\nA Saturday morning cartoon based off of a Final Fantasy game set in the world of Star Wars and soundtracked to Led Zeppelin. Depth, creativity, it's own comedic voice and exactly be best example of what these movies can be.",

            "content": "\"Because that's what hero's do... \nOh, I didn't time that right.\" - Thor, Son of Improv. \n\nThor Ragnarok is revered as a comedic masterpiece by critics and audience viewers alike. This stimulating film is great for laughs and for a strange spin on superhero storytelling; with it's brightly colored and chaotic visuals; with it's strange, yet admittedly hilarious dialogue, Thor Ragnarok is the Jeff Goldbloom of marvel movies. If Jeff Goldbloom was accidentally cast into a dark, serious, coming-of-age film.\nThe acting was on par; Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tessa Thompson (Valkyrie) played off each other easily and expertly. Every character added something unique while keeping the shared theme of hilarity and slight absurdity; despite the serious plot of their story.\nThe film score was created by Mark Mothersbaugh, who is also known for The Lego Movie. He added an electronic/80's synth feel to the movie, fitting well with the bright color scheme and humor. Though not fitting well with the events of the story.\nWaititi's comedic style clearly shows through in the form of constant humor with the superhero genre being the butt-end of the jokes. The excessive amount of humor was likely the result of the dialogue being 80% improvised. This film is defined as a comedy. A lot of people complained about this film, because they found the comedy distracting from the plot.\nWhen you do hear praise, you only hear about how they couldn't stop laughing from Goldbloom's oddball humor and Hemsworths' improvisation. What you hear much less about is the quality of the plot itself. No one really cared about the plot because they were too busy laughing. \nWhich is a shame, because the plot is quite impactful; It raises the stakes immensely and immediately within the first 20 minutes of the film and keeps them raised. It mirrors Thor's character arc in the first film, but on a new and final level. Thor Ragnarok is a story of loss, strength, and growth. He loses his hammer, his father, his hair, and his pride in the first half, and by the end, he's grown more powerful than ever before. And then Korg butts in with \"Oh my god, a hammer pulled you off?\"\nFrankly, it's a waste of plot.\n\tWell-placed humor is not only acceptable, but encouraged; but the movie's constant flow of humor was out-of-character, and juxtaposed the feel of the film with the seriousness of the plot; the film's humor essentially breaks the fourth wall at the end of every scene, and frequently, no, incessantly separates the audience members from the plot; it's really quite efficient; and it's not gentle; it's pretty disorienting for the audience to get yanked out of the story and slammed back in over and over again. This is what the great \"Thor: Ragnarok\" achieved.\nUltimately, the story had a great plot, but no one was able to appreciate it or take it seriously because the character's themselves weren't taking it seriously. Despite all the good things that have been said about this movie, in terms of dialogue vs plot, for anyone who appreciates a good story, Thor Ragnarok is simply a frustrating film.",

Where we would normally be given the geopolitical and social values with a side dose of humor we see these focus points reversed, the end result is a great movie that has to be watched, in the right sequence, with the rest of the movies to understand what is happening when they get to End Game. The story focuses on the sequence of events started when Loki had taken Odin's place on the throne culminating in the end of Asgard, a prophecy foretold as Ragnarok. Cate Blanchette looking like a bad-ass Lilith coming in as Thor's older sister, and rightful heir to the throne, destroying Mjolnir before knocking him out of the bifrost and into a relm controlled by the Grand Master was complete Hollywood, but it worked. By contrast of the gold walled castles in Asgard, with Sicar's \"the edge of the known and the unknown\" being set with a  strong resemblance to the original Star Wars trash scene the movie made good use of the visual setting; even the 'devils anus' looked like it sounds it should. There are several other examples of visually subtle humor, like Banner waking up from being the hulk for two years with beads around his neck like he had been partying the whole time at Mardi Gras, or Stan Lee making his obligatory cameo as the barber who got to cut Chris Hemsworth's hair. I can only say I am going to miss seeing Stan in future movies; I moved to Alaska the day after my seventh birthday in 1976 and had been given an 11\"x 17\" Thor Comic as a present but really for the trip, o say that his stories ignited the imagination of millions of kids just like me would be an understatement, he is still doing it to this day in the minds and hearts of whole new generation. The moral message to Thor Ragnarok, that home is where the heart is, would make him proud; the fact it had more a comedic edge than the rest of the movies in the franchise, I think, would have made him proud because at the end of the day it was always about entertaining us- something this movie did on several levels.

I loved Jeff Goldblum basically playing himself - or, at least, his public persona. Cate Blanchett was born to play a queen and she plays an evil one with relish. It's fun to see the Marvel film's interlacing plots star to tighten and it creates even greater tension. Tessa Thompson is a revelation as a lost Valkyrie who starts off saving our hero for profit before remembering her oath to protect the Throne of Asgard. Her swagger and timing are on point. There's also quite a few really fun cameos - especially if you are a fan of Taika's oeuvre. I did miss Natalie Portman as Thor's Jane and I thought some of the visual effects were a little less than we've come to expect from the franchise, but Ragnarok is still some of the best Marvel has to offer.

Hemsworth and Hiddleston are both on point as ever, Mark Ruffalo excels in his more prominent role, Cate Blanchett is utterly fierce as Hela, giving a stunningly dominant performance as the primary antagonist, and a compelling one at that, even the minor roles stand out, Clancy Brown was booming and domineering as the voice of Surtr, and even in his limited role as Odin, Anthony Hopkins' presence always fills the screen and the scene. One of the big highlights of this film for me is Taika Waititi himself portraying Korg the walking, talking pile of rocks, everything that comes out of his mouth is absolute comedy gold. But on top of all that, everything about the film visually is just fabulous, it's clear that there was a lot of influence from the comics, Sakaar looks every bit like you'd expect a junk planet on the other side of space to look, the colour palate is vibrant and yet doesn't take away from the beaten up nature of the location. All the other locations have distinct feels in terms of their visuals, I especially liked the opening scene with the battle against Surtr, and then the giant dragon. And my god does Mark Mothersbaugh absolutely knock it out of the park with the score, a solid blend of 80s synth rock and traditional orchestration, with additional use of classic rock tracks, Led Zeppelin's \"the Immigrant Song\" a particular highlight during Thor's two big battle scenes. Kenneth Branagh may have introduced the world to Thor, but Taika Waititi found a winning formula with regards to how to approach films surrounding Marvel's god of thunder, and I am thrilled he was brought back as both director and screenwriter for the fourth Thor film, as the guy is a directorial genius.",

As always, Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Idris Elba (Heimdall) & Anthony Hopkins (Odin) gave great performances. I do have to say, though, Jeff Goldblum, who played the role of the Grandmaster on the planet Sakaar, was one of the big highlights of the movie.

Being one of the final threads before Thanos dropped by for Infinity War, this film does a very good job of explaining the absence of Thor and Hulk for Civil War while also giving them both their own arcs outside their comfort zones. I did not like how campy it got, delving too far in humor then it needed to. However, the look, true feel and atmosphere of this film are amazing and truly needs to be experienced.

The introduction to Tessa  Thompson's Valkyrie was awesome hope to see more of her in future film's. She was a total badass and her fighting skills were equal to Thor's.\n\nThe choice to have almost the entire movie take place in space works to the film's advantage and everything looks bright and all the characters pop on the screen. Cate Blanchet's Hela is one of the better villains to be featured in a marvel movie. While she doesn't have a whole lot of screen time, when she is there they have made her out to be a force and one of the strongest villains we have ever seen.

More so than “Civil War”, “Ragnarok” feels like like a Thor movie which is a plus! However I like the first two better ,because they have the serious moments that Ragnarok doesn’t have! Ragnarok is basically the Batman Forever of the MCU which isn’t a bad thing. However I still give it five stars because it is a great movie like the other two,but far from the best! Also it is a Thor movie!!! People need to stop comparing this to Guardians,because it isn’t that type of movie! Also Guardians wasn’t an straight out comedy either! A lot of people died just like they do in Ragnarok but very differently! Ragnarok may be the funniest movie in the MCU,but there are serious moments! Guardians has a lot more humor than this,but we still take the story seriously just like this one! It’s far from a popcorn movie it’s one of the movies I’ve ever seen in cinema!",

Yeah, the second one isn't very good, and the first one isn't incredible either, but they have a feel to them.  That tone is gone here, but the film is still great.  If this were the first Thor movie, I'd give it 5 stars.  Comedy is golden, performances are great, and the sci-fi elements are fresh and new or Thor.  Considering it is the third in the Thor series though, it feels entirely disconnected, and most the characters in the past films are either killed immediately, or they are passing thoughts in the new direction of the movie.  I mean Jane literally gets one mention when a girl sympathizes over how she and Thor broke up.  Great movie, but still wish it was more consistent.  ",

However, you may still want to watch it even if you've seen sixteen films because some of the following films are the MCU at its best. So basically, Thor: Ragnarok is inevitable.",

There is the comedy people love, the action people love, the bright color scheme, and then the unique, fun characters. Hemsworth, Hiddleston, and Goldblum are all excellent in this movie. Jeff Goldblum was one of the funniest characters in the MCU thus far. The vibrant colors is what really stands out in this movie. The colors make the movie pop and feel like a comic book ever more. The movie's comedy makes it hilarious and seem like a joke in a way, but the movie carries a lot of meaning as it is the end of Asgard as a place, but not as a people. I loved the addition of Surtur because he is a great villain to put on the screen, but not rely on because he's full CGI. The best thing this movie does is redefine Thor. Thor was a character that seemed to be broken and unfixable in solo films, but Taika Waititi does just that. This is probably the best directing in the MCU that is not the Russo brothers. Waititi really brings a comic book to life and also voices the funniest character in the film, Korg. Really a great film.\n9.2/10",

The film was directed by Taika Waititi who also directed Hunt for the Wilderpeople. The film stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Tom Hiddleston as Loki.\n\nThe acting in the film is strong for the most part, but I do have to say that a few of the actors didn't really fit their characters.\n\nLike most of the films in the MCU the characters are memorable and some of the best from comic book history, but even though there's characters like Thor  and Loki who I feel are portrayed very well there are a few other characters who let me down personally. One in particular was Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster. As a huge comic book fan I felt that they really toned down his power and didn't use him as well as they could've.\n\nThe cinematography was steady with a few very good shots of the scenery and characters. One shot I really liked was one toward the beginning involving MjÃ¶lnir.\n\nThe film also had some very sound and unique settings ranging from Asgard to the planet Sakaar.\n\nThe set designs and props like most MCU films were done very well from the building designs to some of the various items within the marvel universe.\n\nLike the set design and props the costume design and makeup is also done very well especially with the characters on Sakaar.\n\nThe style I found was okay. The colour scheme and some of the plot points I liked, but I didn't really like some of the other plot points. \n\nThe practical and special effects I felt were just okay. Some times it looked quiet good like with the Hulk, but other times it would look just as bad as when Black Panther was at its worst.\n\nThe film did have some strong action here and there especially the final battle.\n\nThe score of the film was forgettable, but I have to say that I really liked how they used The Immigrant Song by led zeppelin.\n\nThe story though quiet inventive didn't really keep me invested, but at least it worked a lot better then the story from Thor the Dark World. \n\nThe comedy was hard for me because I did find myself laughing, but there was also some jokes that in my opinion fell very flat and just distracted me from the characters.\n\nFor most of the film I felt that it had a lack of atmosphere, but luckily the ending had some quiet strong atmosphere.\n\nI also have quiet a lot of complaints with  the film from the Hulk to some nit picks which I consider as spoilers.\n\nThe film wasn't boring at any point, but I wouldn't say that I enjoyed it as much as most of the other MCU films.\n\nOver all I give it a\n6/10\n66%\n3.3/5\n\nNot as strong as some of the other MCU films",

It provides a nice explanation of Banners whereabouts while setting up Infinity War. I want to say more about the production of the movie but it really is just a standard Marvel film. The reason it is one of the better films is because it is SO FUNNY. This movie could easily be labeled as a comedy because it is filled to the brink with jokes.

At the same time, it's somewhat jarring seeing the film played out as a full-on comedy after everything that's come before it, making the darker material involving Cate Blanchett's very meh Hela, goddess of pointy objects, hard to take seriously. It's also a little disappointing seeing the film tease more substantive themes like Asgard's imperialist past and Odin's mistakes only to discard this thematically piquing material as quickly as it's brought up.

Of course Jeff Goldblum is also worth mentioning for his fantastic oddball-weirdo portrayal of Grandmaster.

The whole thing fell into place perfectly, it was solid and it just had a very nice flow. The acting and choice of actors, again very well done. (heads up, I'm probably not going to say anything negative in this review) I loved that they added so many new characters to this movie. But I also loved seeing all the familiar faces. Tessa Thompson was such a strong female, I adored her, she is so beautiful. Cate Blanchett did a great job (but when doesn't she?) as Hela, very scary. Benedict Cumberbatch his small appearance was one to remember, so funny. One of my favourite parts was the address he stayed at, I mean that was one great wordplay. Really, I could go and call out the whole cast because I think they all did such a great job. Jeff Goldblum, very funny. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba, Mark Ruffalo, they all were amazing. I can't get over it. But I'll stop talking about it, for now. (Matt Damon, I saw you brother, I saw you)\n\nThe soundtrack was so good as well, the song that came on when Thor started fighting. Such a good song. I half expected Wonder Woman to appear on screen everytime it started, but still, such a cool song. Probably making it that ma jam.\n\nThis movie was so beautifully made, and it was so funny. All the people who worked on it deserve every bit of praise they can get. This might be one of my new favourite Marvel movies.

That shift in tone in turn accompanies a move away from the usual MCU emphasis on inner righteousness---it hardly matters that only one who is \"worthy\" can wield MjÃ¶lnir if there is no hammer whatsoever---replacing that swollen-headed (while retaining the swollen-armed, thankfully) self-importance with self-sacrifice and separation, seeking in the end a new and better beginning. More so than most other entries in the Marvel universe, in true mythic fashion (and bolstered by a fashionable retro 80s aesthetic) Thor must be deprived of various phalli (his hair shorn, his eye gouged out, his hammer smashed) to at last overcome the self and adopt assume his place as leader of the fatherland.",

The grand masters planet is ruled but a weird creepy guy. Loki because friends with the creepy guy because he donâ(TM)t want to get hurt. Thor fights them off and then gets put in the fighting dungeon Meanwhile thor and loki are on a different planet, hela is taking over asgrad.  Loki Is the masters slave and thor has to train to fight the beast. When thor goes to fight the beast, he discovers that the beast is the hulk .  Thor thinks that the hulk is cool with him but the hulk done not remember thor. They have to fight and they kind of have a tie. A lttle bit later in the movie thor and hulk break out.  They go back to asguard, thors fights hela, hulk fights her giant wolf. Thor gets his eye ripped out and then defeats hela.  \n\n \n\n \n\n          If I were you I would defiantly need to see this movie. It is one of the best marvel movies. Yeah there are some that they didnâ(TM)t need, some of them are ending scenes. Witch makes you think the movie was going to end, but it wasn't. Overall the movie to me was a great movie. You must watch this movie! It is the best thor movie of all time. One of the greatest movie marvel gas made. One thing I didnâ(TM)t like about it is that there is not enough hela scenes! This movie is a must watch.  \n\n \n\n \n\n           For the readers, I would advise that you WATCH THIS MOVIE !!!!!  It is a great movie, I recommend it for people of all ages.  Want your family to actually sit down and watch a movie with you, RENT THIS MOVIE AT ANY REDBOX IN YOUR LOCATION !!!!",

A spoof movie with some incredible action scenes (especially the one at the beginning), some nice interactions between Thor and Loki, and Thor and The Hulk (inevitably eventually interrupted by forced humor), and a fantastic Cate Blanchett as Hela. \n\nI honestly cannot believe that people find the God of Thunder throwing a ball at a window and have it bounce back and hit him on the head as something even remotely funny. That goes for the majority of the humor in this movie. After watching both Guardians of The Galaxy movies, you pretty much know what to expect. Absolutely every character is going to talk like a schoolgirl from California, everyone is going to act out of character from one moment to the next, and all expectations will be subverted for comical effect. The best example of this last point being the scene where Banner throws himself out of the flying craft to turn into the Hulk and help out in the fight near the end. Was there anyone watching this that didn't know he wasn't going to turn? That he was going to predictably fall flat on his face. Because this is supposedly funny? When the thing you thought was going to happen doesn't end up happening, and the character ends up in ridicule? I wouldn't mind it being predictable if it was funny, but honestly, it's just dumb. Want to turn a Valkyrie into a short brown girl? Whatever. Just make the character work. Seconds after this character's introduction, when she falls of her own spacecraft drunk off her ass, you know it isn't happening. So forced.\n\nThe fact that the movie doesn't even respect the moment of the complete annihilation of the physical kingdom of Asgard, just so the alien that speaks like a British dude can throw in another weak joke in, says everything. This is not a real Marvel characters movie, it's a spoof movie. It's what would come out if you took a serious script and turned it into a 2 hours long worth of Saturday Night Live sketches. There's nothing wrong with this, of course, if it works. But the fact that Marvel chooses to go this route with established heroes and villains, characters we are familiar with (do whatever you want with the Guardians of The Galaxy), shows how little faith they have in this particular Thor franchise. I hope we see less of these type of movies in the future. And if we do, I hope this type of pervasive, forced, dumb humor only infects characters we don't already know and love.",

            "content": "Pros: The composed Music is definitely my favorite in the MCU. It would have been even better if they attempted what the Dark Knight accomplished with two composers. Have Mothersbaugh compose for Sakaar and Doyle for Asgard. I did appreciate the oringial thor theme at the end of the film. Loved the directors humor throughout. Doctor Strange was a great presence. The hulk was at his best. Thor was at his most charming. Loki made an amazing anti-hero. Valkyrie defeated all fan doubt about her casting, easily my new favorite. Hela was the most visually stunning character and beautiful as always. Goldblum was doing his best Goldblum. All the Hidden celebrity cameos were gems. And last but not least, the Stars of the whole film, Skurge and Korg. This movie had similar beats to previous films such as The Dark Knight Rises but I felt it was better paced and the chacaters were much more likable. Thereï¿ 1/2(TM)s almost nothing to not like. It all landed for me with the exception of one or two jokes: the characters, humor, music, story, adventure, and action. \n\nCons: The sudden death and absence of recognition of Thorï¿ 1/2(TM)s fallen friends. \n\nOverall: Easily makes it into my Top 5 MCU films",
