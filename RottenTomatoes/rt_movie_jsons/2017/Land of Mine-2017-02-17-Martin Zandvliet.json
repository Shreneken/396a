This one, however is one of the most devastating war films I've ever watched. The war was actually already over, but the Danish military made their German POW's clear their beaches of land mines. The film shows a small group of German soldiers made up of mostly teenagers who weren't brainwashed by fascism and Nazism, but just happened to have their number called. Many of them died not directly by the enemy, but by bombs planted by their own country that they were made to diffuse. A devastating portrait of the hatred war inflicts on even those we think of as the \"good guys\" turning just as bad as those we consider the \"bad guys\". Revenge doesn't heal. Only forgiveness. It may be a long, and arduous process, but letting your enemy blow themselves up in the postscript of the war didn't make anyone feel better. Masterpiece of a film, and study of humanity.",

            "content": "This is not a war movie; it's, in its own way, a delicate tale about human connections and what war can do to people. The main characters are literally children who just want to go home and see their parents again, and instead, they're forced to embark on something very similar to a suicide mission, to pay for something they had no part in. Most of the protagonists were probably like 11 when the war started.\n\n \"Land of mine\" truly shows that there's nothing beautiful in war. Honor, courage, sacrifice, all these things don't matter anymore when it all ends and we're left with nothing but ruins and a broken people. It manages to show the multiple points of view of a very complicated situation, and it avoids any kind of glorification of war. I can guarantee that after seeing \"Land of Mine you won't ever see other war movies the same way again, because most of them will seem slightly cartoonish and naive at times. \n\nThis is a must-see, no doubt about it, but please be aware of the fact that it's really hard to watch. This is not something I would watch in class. If you have anxiety problems, or even just if you're a very sensitive person, it can get really hard to sit through some scenes. There's two in particular that I haven't stopped thinking about for days (the scene set at night with the soldiers was really bad. I had to get up and take a deep breath when I watched the movie).\n\nThe acting is really good, especially considering the fact that most actors are pretty young. I think this was one of Louis Hoffman's first roles, for example. You might know him from \"Dark\" on Netflix. He play Sebastian. I didn't recognize the actor playing Ernst but he was excellent too. And the Danish officer was just fantastic!\n\nThis is one of the most beautiful movies I've seen in the past year, but it's not a fun, light watch. It's not even a war movie. It's a story of love, loss, hate and understanding. It deserves to be appreciated more.",

            "content": "It is difficult to believe that in just one hundred minutes, so much could be discussed and developed. The human, deeply emotional but by no means overdone or sentimental message transcends the specifics - the themes of post-war hate, forgiveness, justice are applicable to any conflict anywhere in the world.\n\nThe basis for the film is a real series of events. After the war, the British, the Danish, and the German authorities agree on using POWs to clear minefields, tens of thousands of mines\u2026\n\nWe are firmly outside the Geneva Convention here\u2026 as that agreement resulted in barely \u2018trained' teenage prisoners being sent to the coastline, where more than forty thousand mines were to be defused and removed by them. Essentially, a war crime was committed, full stop.\n\nBut this raises complex questions, and the film, with its deeply affecting human story manages to raise them beautifully: where is the line between a desire for vengeance and justice? What is individual vs collective responsibility after a war, especially as we have here young boys who were conscripted by Hitler in the last months and weeks of that war?\n\nThe film could have been a mere gory affair with over-the-top emotional button-pushing. Instead, it employs astounding restraint - where shock and horror does occur, it serves as an absolutely essential part of the narrative and character development.\n\nThat narrative is ambitious: it manages to tackle subjects as difficult and complex as xenophobia, misguided and/or uninformed kinds of patriotism, prejudice, white-washing of history\u2026 Even if all of the POWs had been fully brainwashed and indoctrinated boys (they are not), it is impossible not to empathise with them.\n\nThe contrast between \"if they are old enough to go to war then they are old enough to clean up the mess\" and \"they are just little boys crying for their mother\" could have been presented in a hugely manufactured manner, but the film manages to hammer it home with remarkable economy and restraint.\n\nOn top of all this, it also presents us with a staggering personal journey: that of the Danish officer in charge of the boys, who genuinely transforms himself from a resentful, hate-filled individual into someone who makes a personal sacrifice, with consequences we can only guess, to save at least some of the boys. Similarly, a local mother and her little daughter manage to convey a universal story about prejudice and what it can change into. A dropped basket of bread tells in a split second more than many pages and minutes of overworked script could do.\n\nVisually, the use of the colours and the vistas of the coastline give the film a mesmerising look. It is a Universe of subdued colours, with abstract patterns of the flag-marked minefield. The clashing and constantly changing elements of nature remind us of how Tarkovsky underpinned his story with those elements in Ivan's Childhood.\n\nThe acting is stunning, it goes from restrained minimalism to visceral explosions of emotions. The editing, the camera work, the framing are superb. We go from vast vistas to Sergio Leone-style close-ups with a pair of eyes that can tell pages and pages of stories, we go from pure poetry to naturalistic (but utterly functional and not overdone) depictions of absolute horror.\n\nLouis Hofmann as the boy who becomes the leader of the group delivers a performance of an intensity we know him for by now (see the Netflix series Dark and other German films, too). The Belton twins are astounding, they age decades in seconds, in front of our eyes.\n\nThe lead role from Moller, who plays the sergeant in charge of the boys, is also spellbinding. Under his stoic surface there is absolute and unconditional hate, which develops into selfless empathy by the end of the film. The inner journey is not linear and not simple - and he is initially downright angry with himself when he notices the first signs of compassion in himself.\n\nThe final lines in the film put the events in a numeric context\u2026 and the numbers are horrific.\n\nHowever, at a personal level, in the micro-Universe of those few lads on that vast beach, the central stories of this film, too are universal. Again, they transcend specific ideologies and historical framing\u2026\n\nLand of Mine is about people being able not only to overcome their mental conditioning in the most inhumane circumstances even, but also to elevate themselves to the level of almost self-destructive altruism.",

It assumes that you have already seen all the atrocities that Nazi soldiers did during WWII and it makes you feel sad for people, that did all of that. It makes you understand, what the Allies felt after defeating the Nazis. The movie has so much suspense and tension, which I haven't seen in a foreign language film for years. It puts you in front of a Batman-like dilemma, that sergeant Rasmussen is facing, which is \"Are we really better than them if we treat them like they treated us?\". He is always trying to get rid of this thought throughout the entire movie, but he can't. Because all of us are humans and all of us have feelings. This movie is brilliant and deserves all the positive reviews that were made about it, as I have never thought I would actually cry because of a Nazi soldier's fate.",

It is a dangerous job and the Germans are young and inexperienced.  One such unit is supervised by Sergeant Rasmussen, a veteran of the war and someone who hates the Germans and what they did to his country during the war.  He takes his anger out on the young boys in his unit.  However, over time his attitude changes.\n\nGreat drama.  Deals with aspects of war that are hardly ever dealt with - what happens after the war ends, how former enemies now have to live with each other and how the victors treat the vanquished.  The attitude towards and treatment of the Germans by the Danes is quite understandable and plausible.  This makes the reconciliation so much more emotional.\n\nQuite gritty - the dangers the German soldiers are exposed to are highlighted very well.   These dangers also up the tension, making for riveting viewing at times.\n\nNot perfect though.  Some of the transformations seem too simple and quick and the conclusion feels a touch too neat.  It would also have been good to see some of the characters' histories, especially the Sergeant's, to provide a bit more character depth and engagement.  Not essential though, as one can easily imagine how he got to be that way.\n\nUltimately, a great story of reconciliation.",

It's only after he has spent time working with these boys that he grows to respect them and feel sympathy for these young men who just want to return home to their families.\nIt was a very well acted film and as you can imagine, extremely tense during the numerous scenes of bomb disposal.

Usually just teenagers, with no actual war-experience, thousands died after being forced to clear the coast-lines by hand, inch by inch, all the while being starved and humiliated by their captors.\n\nThe brilliance of Martin Zandvliet's film lies with the performances. The young German soldiers are all uniformly brilliant, but it is Roland M\u00f8ller who steals the show, as gruff sergeant Carl Rasmussen, the war-weary, battle-scarred combatant assigned to their unit, charged with escorting the recruits to the beaches and motivating them into clearing the mines. His character has a unique arc, in that he swings from loathing his young squad, to almost becoming a father-figure to them at times, but throughout there are surprising twists and turns, that compels the audience to hate him one minute, then love him the next.\n\nThe tension is another key element of the film's success. An early training scene, where the prisoners are being schooled on how to disassemble the different variants of mines, is beautifully written and directed and showcases this taut atmosphere that prevails throughout. It also highlights the festering hatred that was prevalent immediately following the war's conclusion, and how the emotion throughout the affected countries, could lead even apposite people to question their own basic human decency.",

Befitting its subject it's a well-crafted suspense drama, but more than that it's a masterful and deeply engaging work of emotional and moral nuance. It's not every war movie that can make viewers sympathize with the Germans.\n\nLooking back, we like to think of WWII as a good war, a triumph of good over evil. And not without reason. The Allied Powers saved Europe from the genocidal Nazi regime and Asia from the brutality of Imperial Japan. But no war is won without morally questionable acts. And forcing these men to clear millions of landmines was even more questionable because the war had already been won. Using the enemy to clear the mines their comrades had laid may have seemed an expedient solution, yet it smacks of vindictiveness and one can't shake the feeling that what we're seeing amount to a war crime.\n\nIt's the deep ethical questions and personal drama that give the film its depth, but it's the suspense that holds the viewers' attention. We know that at any moment the slightest mistake could end one of these boys' lives. And of course it does, more than once. We dread the moment when the next boy will die, and it' absolutely devastating when it happens. Yet the movie never becomes too mournful, or lingers too long. Soon enough the tone is again tense, or hopeful, or occasionally even humorous.\n\nJust as the film- and the boys'- mood has its ups and downs, so does their relationship with the Danish sergeant placed in command of them (Roland M\u00f8ller). It's naturally antagonistic at first. These Germans were members of the Nazi army occupying his country, and he is their jailer as much as their commander. He tells them repeatedly that he does not care if they are miserable or if they die, as long as the mines are cleared. And he means it, mostly.\n\n It's equally natural that his stance towards them will soften as he comes to see them as people rather than enemies. But this change is not inevitable or without stumbles. At one point he becomes so callous that one almost fears he will become the villain of his own story. It's fascinating watching his conflicting emotions, his struggle to balance his duty with his humanity.\n\nThe result is a deeply poignant, intimate, and earnest film that reminds us that even our enemies are human and even the most seemingly clear cut conflicts aren't always as black and white as we would like to think. There are no easy answers or sense of closure here, but then the men involved never received any either.",

Forced to clear the mines their own countrymen had planted along the Danish coast, while also facing up to the prejudice of those who previous fought against them, the movie does a stellar job of not only getting us to sympathise with the prisoners of war, but also care for them. Many of the mine disarming scenes are close to nail-biting, and whenever one of them goes off it's a genuine shocker, especially in the excellent training phase sequence. The Danish superiors often come across as one-dimensional villains with no redeeming values, with Roland M\u00f8ller's resentful Sergeant being the only one which gets any development or moments of genuine humanity, but it's the only significant weakness I believe the film possesses. It's hard to believe the depicted events were condoned, considering that the young soldiers forced to clear the mines were conscripted at the tail end of the war, and as such had little chance to participate in any important battles. But the film demonstrates how prejudice can often be the most blinding feeling we have, particularly in a time of conflict. Frank, hard-hitting and illuminating, Land Of Mine is a war film which will likely never get the credit or attention it deserves, but if anything, that's even more of a reason to watch it.",

Its point is simple: this is no way to treat children regardless of how Hitler's Germany used them, or what they did in the war.  It depicts the vengeful Allies as little better than the enemy, when they are subjecting the boys to inhuman labour, starvation, beatings and humiliation.  Bridging the two worlds is the boys' commandant, a Danish sergeant who carries out his orders, but with degrees of compassion. The film begs the questions: what is the right punishment for an oppressor and how far down into the population should it have extended; at what point is following orders a defence to war crimes; how were these boys recruited or conscripted; what would these boys have become, if Nazi Germany had prevailed; what do they symbolise now.  And, if the method of clearing the mines was the forced labour of the enemy, in the form of half-starved, sick, scared and degraded teenagers, what guarantee is there even now that the beaches and the other minefields of Europe are safe?  The film's ending, while appropriate to the story, leaves the questions open. The Danish sergeant's way is to understand the past, and then to lock it away, never to be repeated, but the unknown factor is how many agree with him - then, or now.",

At the end of the war, by which time the German army had been turned into a tragic children's crusade, the Danes forced thousands of POWs, many of them teenagers, to disarm land mines, with predictable results. (One wonders why this practice wasn't against the Geneva Convention.) I bailed on this film after 30 minutes; my husband stuck it out and wished he hadn't. A terrible, terrible, terrible film.

            "content": "DAS HURT LOCKER - My Review of LAND OF MINE (3 Stars)\n\nOne of this year's Academy Award nominated Foreign Language films has repurposed its title for certain audiences and it has left me baffled. Originally called UNDER SANDET (translation: UNDER THE SAND), the story of post WW2 German soldiers held as prisoners of war until they can clear the mines they had planted along Denmark's west coast, the U.S. version bears the title: LAND OF MINE. Seriously? That's the sort of bad pun my readers have come to expect from my review titles, but its use here undermines a serious yet flawed piece of filmmaking.\n\nWriter/Director Martin Zandvliet, along with his cinematographer Camilla Hjelm bring a sweeping, widescreen beauty to this harrowing, deeply felt, excruciating story. On a remote, sandy coastline, Danish Sgt. Sgt. Carl Rasmussen (a very good Roland M\u00f8ller), oversees a small troupe of mostly Aryan teenage prisoners. He brutalizes and starves them while demanding they work faster and faster to defuse the mines. His lack of warmth feels appropriate considering the horrors the Nazis brought to his homeland, but the film keeps reminding us of the prisoners' innocence, or at the very least, their lack of ideology. More on that later.\n\nFor much of the running time, we helplessly watch, knowing that at any moment a mine will surely explode. Think of it as THE HURT LOCKER with lesser technology and more blonde hair. Taking a page from Alfred Hitchcock's manual of suspense, Zandvliet builds intense dread as these kids crawl along the beach poking beneath the sand with sticks. Because we know what lies beneath, it's impossible not to watch this film with at least one hand covering your face. I almost walked out during several key moments, unsure that I could take it anymore. The seriousness of the subject matter and the fine performances all around, however, convinced me to stay. But man is it rough to watch a bomb tear apart a person.\n\nIn one scene, Rasmussen slaps the shit out of one of the kids, who seems to simultaneously laugh and cry over his beating. In others, the sergeant acts very tenderly towards his charges. He even laughs when one of the soldiers, in a very movie star quality performance by Louis Hofmann, fakes him out with a bomb noise, which seems wildly inappropriate, but #gallowshumor, right? Rasmussen's mixed feelings echo the themes of the film. How can we reconcile our warm feelings for these kids knowing what their fellow soldiers, or perhaps even they themselves, did during the war?\n\nUnfortunately, Zandvliet eschews this political conundrum in favor of the sentimental \"people are people\" theme. I kept thinking how much richer this film would have been if some of the kids still espoused anti-semitic feelings or if we learned that some had committed crimes against humanity. Instead, we learn of their post-war hopes and dreams of rebuilding Germany and getting on with their lives. We delight in their playing soccer on the beach and we sympathize with them when they go without food. This lack of complexity prevents the film from truly soaring to another level.\n\nIt's fine, suspenseful, gut-wrenching filmmaking, but its point of view left me confused. Yes, it's entirely possible that many German soldiers had little choice but to serve. I understand how under Hitler's dictatorship, the citizens had to follow orders, but his ascendancy came from a groundswell of public sentiment. Hell, half of our own country supports the actions of a President the other half despises, and yet we're all responsible, in a way, for his rise to power.\n\n\nIn one particularly, harsh scene, a group of British soldiers beat up and urinate all over one of the prisoners. He takes the humiliation, we're led to think, in the manner of Jesus dying for our sins. He gets it. The Nazis sucked. They had it coming. LAND OF MINE, however, hedges its bets by wanting us to forget about such vengeful feelings and hope that acts of kindness lay the groundwork for a better future. A wonderful thought, if only life were so simple. This good film could have achieved greatness had it given us that extra layer of painting one or two of its prisoners as Nazi sympathizers. Still, this missed opportunity merits a look, a cowered look, but a look nonetheless.",

            "content": "Movies about World War II are pretty much a genre in and of themselves now, so filmmakers have got to find largely unknown stories to tell in order to make something interesting. Land of Mine--which has the Danish title Under sandet, translating to the far less punny Under the Sand--works generally well thanks to its solid storytelling and strong filmmaking. There are stretches in which the script treats the characters are more of an amorphous collective than individuals, and although the intentions are understandable, it undercuts some emotional ties, but the movie still has quiet tension about it with strong acting. The movie tells the true story of a group of German prisoners of war in 1945 who, directly after the end of World War II, are sent to defuse and remove thousands of landmines scattered across the beaches of west Denmark while under the watch of a Danish sergeant. What makes the movie have of air of uniqueness is that it's generally quiet, letting the tension lie quietly below the surface, capable of going off at almost any moment. Writer/director Martin Zandvliet spends much of the film's 100 minutes on engrossing the audience in the landscapes of the movie, with establishing shots that are as peaceful as they are cold. Music isn't used much, letting diegetic ambience create most of the movie's mood. The actors are all on similar planes in terms of believability but vary in delivery in ways fitting to their respective characters. Whereas the positives in Land of Mine seemed to have come to fruition in the production and post-production stages, the Zandvliet's writing isn't quite as satisfying. Now there are moments where the underwhelming nature is warranted and adds to the movie, but the first half isn't as good as the second in that these characters are generally indistinguishable from each other. The intention of making their humanity shine through more and more over the course of the film is apparent, but we don't know much of anything about these guys in the beginning. Their prisoners of war and therefore one would expect more depth to them off the bat, but here they don't become more of their own people until after the midpoint. Dynamics grow and stakes feel higher later on, but my interest in these characters was strained at times in the first half, and I was left with the performances to be as engaged as I was. Nonetheless, Land of Mine is careful in its portrayal of war--or post-war--violence in that it never fetishizes the physical of emotional torment of those onscreen, instead treating it as a period to the run-on sentences that these characters' lives have become. There's a sense of endlessness that the movie wears well. Script choices are understandable but unhelpful in the first half, fighting the movie's depth by insisting that the characters be portrayed in knee-high storytelling, but when the audience is submerged, the movie becomes more engaging, even though it won't warrant heavy discussion or another viewing. 7.4/10, pretty good, B, above average, etc.",

            "content": "Teen POWs in the post WWII Denmark.\n\nA Danish war-drama that was inspired by the historical account, but all the characters were fictional. Remember this title for another six month, because I am confident this film will make a journey to the west coast of the USA to compete at the 89th Academy Awards in the coming February. I have seen many foreign films, but I'm not this much positive for any others. If this film fails to make, then that would be a great disappointment despite having no idea of what are the other four films. So this is just for now, my stance may change later.\n\nAnyway, the film was heartbreakingly amazing. The WWII stories I had seen those told from the perspectives of the Australian, Japanese, Korean, Russian to African and European to the American western sea, Hawaii. And this is a Danish story, sets in just after the end of the war where prisoners of the war were used to clean up the mess. In the opening the teen German POWs were trained to defuse the land mine explosives and then later the unit was handed over to the Danish sergeant Carl Rasmussen where they are all going to work in one of the west coast landmines that was used to defend the Scandinavia by the Nazi. That is the story told how it all ends in the remaining parts.\n\nThis was like another 'Kajaki', but not actually a war film. Using of the prisoners as the labourers is a violation, according to the Geneva rule. That's the point of the film, focused to reveal the inhume act. But it was not anything like 'The Railway Man' 'Unbroken' or the 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'. Watching a film about the brave soldiers inspires us and bring patriotism, but in this those teen kid screaming whenever something goes wrong really brings heartache. So not everybody feels comfortable with it, especially the family audience. But there were lots of edgy moments and you would never know what events follows.\n\n\"If they are old enough to go to war, they are old enough to clean up.\"\n\nIt was shot is the real location, and I think that part contributed to depicting the actual atmosphere where most of the POWs lost their arms and legs and some exploded into many pieces in the air. It was a simple narration, but the visuals talked itself more than anything else. All the actors were outstanding, especially those 4-5 German teens and of course the Danish sergeant Carl. I think the Carl's influence had more impact, after seeing the opening scene where he went outrage and beat up those German soldiers returning home.\n\nThere are a couple of small twists, but there are some scenes which are not easy to get over. Even though we know those were just fake, but that does not work once you totally into the story deeply. This is a different kind of emotional film, something you rarely experience. The director who is also the writer must be appreciated for handling it perfectly. Especially keeping the screenplay uncomplicated and between the two nations, where in the real event involves the British officials. I have never seen his other films, but this one will define him forth and the people are going to recognise him. So I hope he'll keep up doing such level films in the future.\n\nI have never seen such film, I mean seen some where the kids were tortured, but this was very unique and totally a different perspective for that takes place in the backdrop of the WWII. Especially the Germans perspective is the very rare kind. So I'm kind of thinking if Germany picks 'Look Who's Back' for the Oscars, the contest between these two would bring two different moods. At this point I don't remember any Danish film I have seen so far in my life other than this one which I feel is the best Danish film ever. I mean, come on, who would do such film where your own nation, if not the whole nation, the one who represent was shown in the negative shade over the Nazi Germans. This is definitely one of the best films of the year. Highly recommended.\n\n8/10",
