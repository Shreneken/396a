That leads to missing  some of plot arcs, some of characters development, some of the details. Some scenes could be shorten to fill the movie with something else, some scenes could be cut at all.\n\nI wanna believe, that Kyoto Animation made their best. And if you read manga before or after the watch, you might be dissapointed a bit. But as a self-sufficient movie, it is great.\n\nThe great story basis from manga, the great arts and animation, absolutely wonderful soundtrack. And a huge emotion hammer that strikes you as hard as it could. The story about communication, lack of communication, school bullying and its mistakes, depression and 'friendship, that is not about a words or a logic'.",

            "content": "Have always been a big fan of anime, particularly Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki without restricting myself to just them (some of my favourites are actually without either involved).\n\nAny film dealing with bullying and its consequences deserves to be applauded for the effort. Bullying, often stemming from something that should be a non-issue but turns out to be an easy target for bullies (for examples if your parents disallow you to play a popular video game for obvious reasons, if you have a posh accent, if you listen to and perform classical music, if you have a physical or social disability, false rumours spread about you, if you were a hard-worker rather than somebody who messed about and disrespected substitute teachers) is something that is very much relevant still and has damaging effects, it is an issue that needs to be addressed and acted upon much more than it is. This is coming from somebody who suffered merciless bullying myself in school, for all the above reasons apart from the first (in my case my school did nothing about it too), and nearly a decade on it has damaged my confidence/self-esteem, made me feel worthless and made my already bad anxiety worse despite getting a degree in music and singing regularly.\n\nSo as one can probably tell, 'A Silent Voice' really resonated with me on an emotional level. At the same time, it also really made me think and see that there is much more to the issue, the bully, the witnesses and the victim than one would tend to perceive. 'A Silent Voice' also turned out to be a very good film in its own right. It isn't flawless, some of the supporting characters are under-explored and in a few cases inconsistently and one-dimensionally written and some of the story jumps around and doesn't always feel complete.\n\nDespite being over two hours, didn't think it was too long considering the number of characters and their stories. If anything, perhaps 'A Silent Voice' would have been even better as a series which would have solved the problems.\n\nOn the other hand, 'A Silent Voice' has an awful amount to recommend. Great isn't a strong enough word to describe the animation. Rich in meticulous background and character detail, atmospheric and ethereal in colour schemes and alive to nuances in its use of settings and character gestures and expressions, it becomes a character of its own and there are some memorable images throughout like towards the end. The music has whimsy, haunting beauty and understatement, while not overbearing the drama and letting it speak when needed. The song is catchy.\n\nThe writing is thought-provoking and contemplative, doing it in a way that will make bullying victims and those who bullied alike identify with what is said. A lot of it is remarkably insightful, and even when the film was really resonating with me it taught me a lot about an issue that isn't as black and white as perceived. The story has its issues but has a strong emotional core, with the truly powerful and touching ending leaving me shell-shocked.\n\nNot often does one find themselves rooting for a bully as well as the victim, 'A Silent Voice' is one of those rarities. The voice acting is dynamic.\n\nIn summary, not perfect but very well done. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "This is it. This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. An undisputed masterpiece, a heart shattering experience, a rewarding watch, a tearjerker, a lesson. It is what a film should aspire to be. I don't watch anime, and many have been the times I have critisized it because of extraordinary premises, bizarre animation and annoying characters. But this... This movie changed my world. The humanity of this film touched my soul, its realism tingled with my senses, the heartbreaking moments got me crying like a baby (and I almost never have such strong emotions for films), and the themes it tackles resonated with me.\nThe film is about an ostracized, socially anxious, stressed Japanese teen names Shoya, who attempts to make amends with Shoko, a deaf girl he viciously bullied in elementary school, before he kills himself. He has regretted the actions of the past, and believes that he doesn't deserve to live, tackling the first heavy themes of the film, such as suicide, loneliness, regret, guilt, anxiety and trauma. Their interaction, however, inspires him to change his attitude towards life, and with small, but sure, steps, he manages to create strong friendships with people like socially awkward Nagstsuka and Shoko's sister Yazuru, reunite with old friends like Sahara and Kawai, and meet with old bully-turned friend Ueno (who has a crush on him and sees Shoko as a hindrance to their relationship). Overcoming, however, difficulties such as psychological trauma and anxiety is hard, and despite a terrific new start (especially with Shoko), problems soon arise.  Another heavy theme is later revealed in the film through a Shoko-Ueno interaction: self-hate. On the one hand, Shoya closes into himself because he thinks he doesn't deserve happiness (due to the terrible things he did in the past). Shoko, on the other hand, closes into herself, because she believes the suffering of others (including Shoya's) is the result of her handicap. All of this leads to a pretty shocking, but rewarding climax and good ending that will guarantee that you will bawl your eyes out. \nCan somebody please explain to me why this masterpiece of a film lost over The Boss Baby during the selection of the Oscar nominees? The Boss Baby doesn't hold a candle to this perfection. I love the animation in this one. It is very clean and bright and colorful, the character design is attractive and (along with the perfectly executed cinematography) most scenes are thoroughly engrossing and lovely to look at. They give a lot of information about the characters and their psychological state. Then, the music. I love the experimental nature of the soundtrack. While the music is undeniably sentimental, sad and wonderful, some particular sound choices in this one make it a haunting experience. It put you in Shoko's shoes, in a way. Furthermore, I gotta say that A Silent Voice is a wonderful adaptation with extremely well written, fleshed out characters. I resonate with Shoya (regretting actions of the past, feeling alone and isolated, trying to make amends with those I hurt, feeling I don't deserve much happiness, striving to become better, hiding my troubles, bottling up emotions, trying to make others happy), I love Shoko as a character (she deserved a lot better in life, and she doesn't have to apologize for anything, I wish I could give her a hug), I adore the supporting characters (especially Yuzuru and Nagatsuka) and I hate some with a passion (like Ueno and Kazuki). Their interactions feel human and realistic and painful. It hurts me watching them suffer and hurt themselves. I related to them and wanted them to have a good ending. I cheered for them, I laughed with them, I cried with them. I thought about them for some time, and I have to say that this movie is an excellent character study. \nOverall, I cannot put into words how much I love this film. It changed me as a person. It is a deeply saddening story of redemption, acceptance, self hate, improvement, anxiety, fear, disability, regret, guilt and trauma. It is ultimately very rewarding and emotional, despite leaving you with a certain feeling of emptiness. It gives you food for thought, it makes you fall in love with the universe and its characters. The animation and the soundtrack are breathtaking. And overall, if you want a powerful, didactic, sad experience, watch this one. You will not regret it. I'm begging you, go watch this film. It is worth it. It is one of the only films that have made me cry a lot. And that's what a movie should strive to do. Make the viewers emotional.",

The gorgeous animation and music really set me in a contemplating mood. The quietness throughout didn't feel melodramatic, but instead captured the lack of voices that many characters had.\n\nThe relationship between the two main characters and their struggles was masterfully crafted to create a emotionally depressing tale. The symbols of koi fish, firework, notebook, and more were at times quite too complex for me to comprehend. Still I was engaged in the story, and multiple I was on the brink of tearing up. The way voice was communicated in different shape was beautiful. \n\nI watched this movie a while ago, but I still remembered the ending well before coming to this rewatch. However, this time the ending was all the more emotional, and I could not help but letting the tears lose. \n\nThere's some minor problems like uneven focus on some of the minor characters and occasional pacing issues, but they didn't really bother me that much.\n\nOverall, a beautiful drama in many shapes. 9-9.5/10",

The reason I keep rewatching is what is the meaning of the X on people's faces, but after rewatching it I understand why there are X on people's faces, and it's because of his tragic past making his anxiety high(I think it's anxiety because of his reaction to people) I just don't get it why in the manga and the movie they didn't get to be each other as boyfriend and girlfriend, I would like to see them together. It really connects it to the real world, most teenagers are suffering from bullying, I hope this film will give them a lesson if they watch it, now if I connect it to my personal life this one hits hard, it changed me, to be honest, I once decided to kill myself and not letting my love ones know it (well since this is added to my review they'll probably read it), but after rewatching this again and again it changed me, like the part where the main character saved Shoko and while the main character was hospitalized people cried for him because of what he did, same goes to Shoko when his family found out that she was deciding to kill herself they immediately burst out tears. So in short this movie saved my life because I decided to not kill myself. So far this is the anime that I respect and will always be my favorite movie.",

            "content": "Trying to do a redemption story for an unlikeable main character is a difficult task. This is one of the challenges that \"A Silent Voice\" has to deal with it as our main character, Ishida, bullied a deaf girl when he was younger. \n\nHowever, this film succeeds in this whilst also tackling deep themes such as depression, guilt and bullying. One thing this movie avoids falling into is being overly melodramatic. There is some drama and some romance but they are not the central theme. I appreciated that the film remains focused on the problems that Ishida and the deaf girl, Shoko, are dealing with. There are also side characters ranging from the likeable to the unlikeable but even the unlikeable ones have a sort of redemption arc as well.\n\nThe story being told is just so engaging and seeing Ishida and Shoko trying to overcome their issues was just so wonderful. I was almost brought to tears near the end of this film.\nThis is also thanks to the phenomenal music score and the gorgeous animation.\n\nA Silent Voice is a film that will always remain in my mind whenever I think of anime films. It still baffles me though that Oscar picked \"Boss Baby\" over this amazing movie. \n\nFlipping Boss Baby!!! \n\nA Silent Voice is a stunning movie and I highly recommend people give it a watch.",

Everyone keeps saying its a story about bullying and redemption, and that's true for Shoya, but for Shouko I think its more about what happens when we make people feel like burdens for something they have no control on, She tried being nice to everyone around her and she was still rejected by every single person that was not in her family. Even when having Shoya as a friend she still feels as if she is a burden and tries committing suicide, its like that one thing they say about people that get bullied, you can't crumble a paper and then fully un-crumble it after, the same applies here. \n\nReally the only movie that has ever made me cry, would recommend.",

            "content": "A Silent Voice  Anime Review\nBy: Azrael Anacleto aka \"Cyranical\" \"Hayden D\"\n\n[This review contains  spoilers, read at your own risk]\n\nHave you ever felt super down and demotivated off online class? Have you every just felt tired, but finally got that rest that you really needed? Well that's exactly what happened to me, and this movie helped me out emotionally.  The reason it did is because me and the main character practically come from the same roots? Wanna know what I mean? Wanna know what movie I'm talking about? Stay tuned then. Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Cyranical; and welcome to my A Silent Voice review; let's get it!!!\n\nA silent voice, also known by the original English translation as the shape of voice is an infamous Japanese animation movie that won multiple awards. These awards range from the Japanese movie critics awards for best animated feature film; the Japan academy film price for excellent animation of the year; and was nominated for Mainichi Film Award for Best Animation Film. It was produced by Kyoto Animation, a studio known for its excellent and highly innovative symbolic visuals. It was written by the K-On, D-Gray-Man; and Bakuman Japanese screenwriter Reiko Yoshida, additionally it was directed by K-On; Tamako Market; and Sound euphonium director Naoko Yamada. The film is known for it's amazing animation and psychological depth of it's characters. \n\nNow let's start off with the positives, now there are a lot; since this is not only a beautiful piece of media, it has also resonated with many viewers worldwide including myself. Im going to tackle the most obvious one first, the category that this movie won awards in. Yes,\n\nIt tells the story of Shoya Ishida a middle school student that lives a relatively mundane life, before a deaf girl that goes by the name of Shoko Nishimiya transfers in to his school. After a while Ishida and his friends Naoko Ueno and Kazuki Shimada start bullying her because of her known disability. This then prompts her to transfer out of school. After her transfer the principal of the school finds out and exposes Ishida and his friends for bullying Nishimiya; the two retaliate by putting all the blame on the former which causes him to get in trouble with his parents; damage his social reputation rendering him a school outcast; and him being bullied by his friends and their new acquaintances. Years later Ishida is shown selling off everything that he has, and marking his calendar with the reasoning of that he will commit suicide. When the day finally comes, he's about to jump off a bridge when something stops him, that reason being is that he wants to be forgiven for all of his past crimes. He starts off by going to apologize to Nishimaya, but is unsuccessful; which delays his suicide attempt; he decides to get her forgiveness before said deed. Unbeknownst to him his decisions and actions will cause him to find happiness by meeting new friends, reconciling with old ones; and being in good terms with the person that he used to bully; but this is only after he overcomes all of his inner demons that ranges from depression, low self-esteem; being a social outcast and having social anxiety as well.\n\nNow let's start off with the positives, now there are a lot; since this is not only a beautiful piece of media, it has also resonated with many viewers worldwide including myself. I'm going to tackle the most obvious one first, the category that this movie won awards in. Yes, that is correct; it is none other than animation. Back then in the early 2,000's Kyo Ani was making waves because of the studio's brilliant use of cinematography which pertains to the prime visual structure of the anime or movie itself. The studio was known for having colorful and eye catching scenes, full of details and symbolism that provided depth to not only it's scenes but also to its characters. A silent voice is not an exception to this, it not only has amazing animation; but it also has this thing going on where Ishida sees x marks on people's faces. This is a defense mechanism that allows him to feel safe so that he will not be able to hear the voice of other people including his bullies. The film also has this animation style that makes everything feel innocent and lukewarm, which pertains to its two main characters which I'll discuss later in the character's section of this review; now let's get back on track while everything looks innocent and lukewarm for the basic scenes, for happy scenes everything lightens up and is highlighted; for sad and serious scenes there is a dark atmosphere complimented by darker colors and a fantastic soundtrack. Additionally the animation style is highlighted by its character's, Ishida and Nishimiya has this air and this look that makes them feel like they're innocent victims; while Ueno has this air and look that makes her be highlighted as a source of conflict for our two main characters. This movie truly has brilliant animation, what more can I say; and even today where there are some films and anime that could rival it in terms of visuals such as weathering with you; it still ages properly even throughout all these years. Watching this movie in 2021 actually made me breathe a sign of fresh relief, because in this current time  where studios are known for pumping out anime with mediocre animation, this movie being a product of Kyoto Animation stands out from that even now; unfortunately the studio is no more because of a fire incident that burned down the studio along with its workers and staff. Condolences to the families of those who passed away and to the studio itself, I and everyone else will miss you for bringing us wholesome stories with stunning visuals plus animation.\nThe next pro that I am going to be talking about is the OP and the ED, and the soundtrack of the film; now obviously these are two different categories; but since they are both sound then I will just group them up together to make my life a lot more easier than usual; plus they have the same reason that makes me consider them a pro in the first place. The Op and ED really suits the themes while highlighting the feelings of the characters and the events that are unfolding between them. The opening song is a sort of rock upbeat oriented song, and it plays at the opening of the movie obviously; as you can see it works with the visuals being played so well because it blends in with the mood of Ishida and his friends having a fun school life; this is obviously before Nishimiya is introduced to them. As for the ED, it starts off with a soft tune but then really molds itself to be a sort of a redemption song, which fits in perfectly with Ishida's redemption and change in the ending of the movie. Now for the soundtrack of the movie, my reasoning for it is practically the same, the score that plays while the events of the story takes place just works, they just fit; that's basically it. \n\nNow let's move on to next pro, that's the ending; the reasons for it being a positive are the following; the visuals of the ending are really good; it serves as a good conclusion to the movie as well; showing everyone that Ishida with the help of his friends is now finally able to face the music which pertains to what other people are saying about him; he now is able to hear them all and it doesn't pace him as much as it did before. Next up the soundtrack that plays during it blends in perfectly; let me elaborate it starts off all moody and then it slowly brigtens up perfectly in synch with when the x marks of the people around Ishida start disappearing; that in itself is a beautiful work of cinematography.\nNow I'm going to move on to the most important positive of this movie and why it is so impactful. The themes that it presents are very heavy and impactful to us the audience, because they are relatable and furthermore they can also be considered real; all of the themes expressed can legitimately happen to an individual. These themes are, feeling of isolation; social anxiety; depression; feeling of numbness; being bullied because of your disability which makes people think you are abnormal or different from everybody else; being deaf and how it affects not only the person suffering from it; but also the people that are close to them. One of the reasons why these themes struck out to me as individual is that back then when I was in high school and elementary, I was very lonely and wasn't good at socializing; so seiing Ishida be a portrayed as a social outcast; with moments such as him just staring out of the window while overthinking with his negative thoughts really stood out to me; and it reminded me of myself from years back. Now I did gain confidence and made friends after a couple of years; but it wasn't easy and it came with trial and error. While yes having your other classmates start trying to integrate you to their friend group is a thing that could happen and did happen to me, the process and the pressure that you feel in order to be fully one of them is tremendous and is only exclusive to you as an individual. Now at the start they try to coarse you into going out to specific events with them which you will eventually get used to, but at the start the pressure was definetely there especially if you were in uncharted territory to begin with. Now me being bullied in elementary and not having that many friends was one of the reasons to why my self-esteem was low back then and why  I was so careful on leaving a good impression on friend groups and friendly people in general, now I did gain confidence and many friends later on but I had to constantly reinvent myself and there was even a point where I was lost and didn't know what really was the true me; but though sheer effort and the support of my friends I was able to overcome all of that. Which brings us to Ishida and his character arc, he went through the same experiences that I did; he got bullied in school; he was a social outcast at one point; and at the end of the movie he was now what you can call a normal person despite all the pain that he went through and his long journey that it took to get him there though himself and his friends he got through all of it, this just resounded with me and when it all clicked it made me almost cry. I'm not done yet, themes of anxiety and being numb is also a thing that me and him have experienced. Before I started online college class I was full of motivation and confidence in pursuing my chosen coarse, but after three weeks everything just started crumbling for me. My motivation was nonexistent, I loss my motivation when it came to studying medicine; my confidence was dwindling; everyday felt the same it didn't even feel like I was a human; it just felt like I was an academic machine that just read books and researched everyday; I also wasn't learning that much; and it was very painful to me; since back then I used to be super motivated to study and pursue high grades. Now everything just feels like a chore, and it's super sad and dissapointing; there was even a point where I started crying due to not being able to rest due to the overload of activities which I didn't experience in my first year of online class back in 12th grade. I remember this one time where I hugged my mom before college started then I suddenly started crying because I coudn't take it anymore, she comforted me and told me to keep on going; the same thing my friends did and it helped a little bit; my brain at this point was dominated by negative thoughts such as, \"Oh you need to get high grades in order to shift coarse\" which I did consider and am currently pursuing, \"You should just give up, you're talented enough to get a job and you're not learning stuff anyway\" \"Shut up, you're a machine that doesn't deserve happiness\" \"What if you  just failed and reenrolled somewhere\" \"If I failed and had to repeat everything, I don't think I can bear it.\" those thoughts kept getting louder and more pessimistic while I though of them every second, but I kept on praying and kept asking for emotional support from the people closest to me; thanks to them I now am feeling better and have started recovering from what I call college anxiety. Ishida went through all these things as well, and I know it sounds stupid but he had balls he really tried to kill himself; which I did taught off but way too much of a pussy to try. When I saw this man try and jump off the bridge I was like damn this guy might be more of a man than me, that shit takes balls respect; but then after that I finally came down to earth and realized just how stupid that sounded; I did realize that giving up now would not be beneficial especially since I feel like I can really make my dreams come true if I do graduate from college, and I need this degree for that; I need to stomach the pain and keep on going; I don't care if it makes me numb just keep on coming I'll endure them all I'm strong like that. Now getting back to Ishida, he overcomed everything through the help of Nishimaya and his friends and of coarse himself as well which is practically the same as what happened to me; good for us man. \n\nAs for the final positive, and possibly the most important one; this is the characters section. Remember when I told you that  the cinematography makes the two main characters feel innocent and lukewarm, well that's because they are. In order to elaborate, Ishida and Nishimaya are both victims of people's immaturity and society's dark parts. Sure Ishida was a horrible person back then for bullying this girl, but he was a child that was influenced by his friends and was very immature; maybe seeing that this girl was being treated differently; being treated special just because she was deaf made him jealous because he wanted to be the center of attention too; this then could have potentially lead him be lash out to her because he was jealous of the way she was treated; or it could just be a case of him being a immature bastard; we don't know only the author does. After he was exposed everything went downhill for him; his friends turned on him and started bullying him by spreading nasty rumors about him; not to mention they also made him a scapegoat for their sins; his social status flunctuated; his mom felt disappointed and angry at him; he started becoming a social outcast which lead to him developing severe mental illnesses like depression and social anxiety accompanied with low self-esteem and being a coward; eventually as a defense mechanism his brain reverted him to his true nature a gullible cowardly innocent idiot; this was who he truly was before he started being a bully; in addition to that he also developed  this mechanism where he puts an x on people's faces; that way he doesn't hear all the bad things that they say about him which is a pretty extreme but could be realistic reaction. The movie portrays his battle with himself extremely well, as it highlights multiple times in the film that he battles his guilt for what he has done in the past and even constantly blames himself for every bad thing that has happened in his life; thats why it's so fulfilling when finally attaines peace and happiness;  while being reconciled and accepted by everyone around him. As for the other characters, they are portrayed as a bit more mature than standard teenagers; which sounds so stupid because they are all super immature; but my justification of this is that there was this one time where after an argument in the classrooom; the friends came over and tried to fix it with Ishida which unfortunately leads to him falling out with them; but it was still a valuable effort; as most teenage characters in anime will just doable down on their mistake and either avoid the person entirety till they apologize out of guilt; or act hostile towards them. As for Nishimiya she was also brilliantly portrayed, you can see her deteoring emotional health throughout the movie when she fails the confession to Ishida and when she sees how much her sister and family really looks out for her; this eventually prompts her to think that everything would be so much better without her weighing them down; now I don't know about you but I think this is a natural reaction. The ways the film portrays all of these using themes and emotional turmoil though the use of unique animation, visuals, storytelling; soundtracks; OP and the ED; and through visual effects just makes this entire movie that much better; and I love all the characters to death as well. In addition to all of this, I don't know a single thing about deaf people; but I did notice that they are some moments in the movie that show how they live; and how special they are to society despite them having a disability; so props to the film for that.\nNow it's finally time for the cons section. There are only three  negatives that I have noticed from this film. The first one is that the pacing was a bit off in certain times, which I noticed when it came to the ending parts was that everything just started working out in the last 15 minutes of the movie; and everything just went by so fast.\n\nThe next negative was that I felt like there should have been more backstory about Ishida's friends and what went throught their heads; that would have allowed us to understand them better, now I'm not a manga reader; but apparently thanks to me seeing one at a youtube comment section while I was looking for the title of the ED and the OP of the film; I saw that he listed the differences of the two; and apparently the manga was more detailed and offered more explanation for the backstory of Ishida's friends; which I thought could have appeared in the film and could have provided more light to Ishida's backstory. I did some research and found out that the manga came first, so while the movie was condensed pretty well according to manga readers; I thought that the backstory of the friends was important and needed to be in the film. \n\nThis final one I'm not really sure if it's a negative, but I would like to point it out eitherway before I forget about it. Ishida sometimes makes me cringe, because of how stupid he is sometimes; like yeah I get it you're a dense moron which isn't really his fault; but the writer's because every MC nowadays seems to be a dense moron so that the story goes on for longer; but the amount of times that Ishida cannot read between the lines and all the stupid shit he does just makes me cringe sometimes. \"How is he so relatable yet so stupid and cringe at the same time, I don't get it?\" Yes he does have various mental illnesses which could potentially factor into it. \"But is that really the reason or was he just written that way?\" That's what I really want to know, writers.\n\nPros:\n- Stunning visuals, and great creative animation from Kyoto Animation as always\n-Great OP, ED\n-Amazing soundtrack\n-A really fitting ending\n-Emotional attachment to the audience\n-Explored mature emotional themes that are realistic\n-Great psychological depth of characters\n\nCons:\n-A bit of a pacing problem\n-Ishida is a bit annoying and cringe sometimes because of him being stupid and gullible for a majority of the movie.\n-Backstory of Ishida's friend's could have been included and helped shred light to his story.\nThis wraps up my a silent voice, also known as the shape of voice anime movie review. This movie was not only amazing, but it was also emotional; explored realistic themes; and also made the audience relate to it at an emotional level. Too bad I didn't cry while watching it, as I felt like I could have had a way better watching experience had I did; since everything did reasonate for me; but at the end of the day I decided to be a man and hold back my tears like I usually do when it comes to emotional pieces of media like this. As for the recap, here we go. The movie had a bunch of positives for me those being, great animation and visuals; great storytelling; fantastic OP and ED that complimented its scenes well; interesting and deep characterization; explored mature and realistic themes that are highly relatable to it's audiences; a well fitting soundtrack that complimented the movie nicely; managed to appeal to the audience and be relatable on an emotional scale; and of coarse had a fantastic conclusion to it's story. As for it's negatives; well there was a bit of some pacing issues, me being annoyed at Ishida for him having cringeworthy moments; furthermore the exception of the backstory of Ishida's friend that I felt like where really needed to the story.\nOverall this was a wonderful movie, and an even more fulfilling experience. I highly recommend it to everyone looking to unwind from a long day of academics, work; or just a stressful day in general; but don't be deceived this movie can be watched  plus enjoyed by everyone as it has plenty of lessons while being extremely enjoyable as well; in short I highly recommend it to everybody out there that hasn't seen it yet; what are you doing go stream it on netflix or crunchyroll; it will totally deliver in terms of your expectations. To close things out; I give A Silent Voice/The Shape Of Voice a 8/10 for my overall rating. This has been Cyranical, thank you so much for reading this in depth review of A Silent Voice; I really enjoyed making it and it took me a lot of effort and time to finish it; show some love by liking it and sharing it on social media to everyone you know if you enjoyed this review.

            "content": "The movie \"The silent voice\" is a good animation movie that I feel very appreciate about the plot, characters, scenes, sound (instrument/effect), etc. \nSo, let's talk about the plot and character. First, the story of a new student named Shoko Nishimiya who is a lead actress and she's deaf. She tries to get along with friends but ends up with bully from Shoya who a lead actor is, and his friends. And then the word of the bullying of Shoya reaches the principal, he is split up as the culprit by his teacher. After the class bully toward him but at that time he thinks it was Shoko's fault and 2 of them are fight. Later, she is transferred to another school. But one day, Shoya wants to return a Shoko's book that he kept it since they were in same school. At that time, Shoya get bully from others and fallen into depression that he blocks others around him like not look them in the eye, not talking to others. But lastly, he accepts what happen to him and realize himself and want to apologize to Shoko for his mistake. So, he finds Shoko and talking to her. At the end, he accepts everyone around him and that's the first time he is happy with his life. \nFor this point, I think the story tell about the bullying in real life that everyone ever seen. The bully problem still remains in everyday life even if it's an action, speech, disable person and so on. Everyone can be a good or bad person it's depends on each person. This story is telling about who is doing bad to others then they will get affect by their actions and one day they can't stand in society. But you can accept the real world and your action and fix it like try to be a better person and also one day a good friend will approach you. For the sound effect and instrument, it goes the same mood of the movie. The instrument that makes me cry and feel appreciate to each character. And also, the scene in term of color, drawing and animate the character these make me access to the role of each character very much. This plot is quite plain but full of meaningful story. I watch this movie many times because it's a good story with good ends and also can make me have a passion to do something else. Overall is good so I rate 10/10.",

            "content": "A Silent Voice is a dark, violent movie with a lot of realism. It is a cartoon reflecting Japanese society. Teenage life and friendship That comes with bullying, violence, and suicide, which many scenes are not suitable for children.\n\nEnough is not a love movie the general audience may be less involved. But not because the movie is not good. But just because I, in my childhood, had no direct experience with bullying cases, on the contrary, I actually felt that this was a good cartoon movie that expands society and gives us a better understanding of another group.\n\nThe story begins with the characters in grade 6, deaf girl Shoko Nishimiya moved to a new one, although she tries to do good. But she does not get along well with friends the most serious thing is that she is severely bullied by the bully Shoya Ishida. Every day, five years have passed, and people have grown apart and grown up, but this time, Shoya becomes a stranger with no one else want to be acquainted with. He reunited with Shoko and tried to fix everything he had done in his childhood. Although the heroine has pity with her nature or disability that sets her apart from her peers. But her incompatibility was actually not a deformity. If this is your consistent goodness So good that it seems like you have only one flaw: weakness. Sometimes we do not know what to call it. Good luck or bad luck That she didn't have to hear the teasing from her classmates but what is definitely serious is that even if you do not hear but she was physically bullied, which left her no less hurt than abusive words she hadn't heard. Other normal characters, including the protagonist They are all monsters, either directly or indirectly. Express more or express less It can be seen that everyone tries to act mean in order to be accepted by the group. At that time, the male protagonist didn't understand why the heroine had to be good all the time. It's strange, why not try to fit in with other people, even though myself and my classmates haven't even tried to learn sign language to communicate with her.\n\nUp to this point, one of the things that the average viewer may have had the same emotions or experiences as the protagonist of the movie. Each character Both main and supporting characters They all seem to exist in our school, but they are small to grow, that is, we have to think of at least one of our school friends. We've all met people who mean, or not, we ourselves, who were more or less mean to other people, but mean sometimes doesn't always mean he's bad. At the very least, as he grew up, he slowly learned the true 'friend'. He slowly understood the remorse and tried to correct it. But society just froze the idea of itself being bully, it had to be bully forever, and convinced that it wasn't bully like that. I made this Forgetting to think that it will be more, less, will be lighter, karma is karma, doing is doing and delivering results all together.\n\nThe movie tells the story continuously and is quite long (2 hours and 9 minutes). Sometimes I get bored. But it's also good that there are jokes or hilarious characters. And I like the storytelling with many scenes, for example the male protagonist is not sociable. Therefore, rarely eye contact So many pictures Which is the view of the hero Interesting is the hero who used to have friends has herd. But he turned out to be someone who can speak but rarely speak. How he loses friends and social acceptance? The answer is not everyone hates him that he really likes bully, but everyone starts hating him. When he speaks the truth about others and then that is the truth that the person does not want to hear or admit that he does\u2026 he himself is\u2026 especially anything that is bad.\n\n\tSilence in the meaning of A Silent Voice, or the sound that cannot be heard, thus has a profound meaning. And sometimes it's even more frightening than you think.",

Now coming to the main part the story, what can I say other than it's a ethreal masterpiece, this one of those movies that will surely make you sit down and think about your life choices for days it presents social anxieties, suicidal thoughts and past regrets in a way that I've never explored before, it put the viewers in a literal roller coaster of emotions and contrary to popular opinion I never felt that \" a silent voice\" was ever a romance movie it felt more like a deeply explained redemption arc and don't get me wrong there was a sence of love and affection between the characters but unlike 95% of clich\u00e9 on the internet the character's core  actions were not deviced by love itself there was a lot more to it and personally that's something that I've been trying to get from a decent storyline for a long time,like Shoko's only desire that someday people would start to understand her and would care for who she is not because of her disabilities and and how Ishida wanted to reedem himself for his past mistakes, but given that their both still wrong about their approach to the situation is and that's what is being explored in this movie, and I saw some people saying that they cannot stand this movies approach because they consider Ishida's past is irredeemable, which I find absolutely idiotic because If a person is able to understand his mistakes and is ready to make amends to reedem himself then forgiveness to his actions isn't an option it becomes a necessity for at the end of the day were are all just living a life together to the end and by not letting them correct themselves and letting them suffer even when they are considering changing, then how different would it make you from what they were before ,this is an anime classic masterpiece no doubt",

We lose friends and thus, we blame ourself for everything. As the main character starts to lose confidence in himself, through regular bullying from previous friends and rightfully placing blame in himself for hurting others in the past, he can't seem to look at people anymore. Ultimately the bully becomes the one being bullied. There are these \"X\" placed on everyones face and he can't bare to look at anyone or make friends because he sees himself as being less of a human. He can't make friends and doesn't even know how because he can't bare to hurt someone greatly like he did in the past. The ending is beautiful to me and I hope anyone who relates to him in this manner can overcome their fear of loneliness and start loving oneself.\n\nPeople should watch this movie, not only for its beautiful animation but the lesson that it teaches us (even if it doesn't relate to us) is powerful. Forgive and love others, but most importantly yourself. Everyone makes mistakes, small or large, as cliche as it sounds; We're all just human.",

Interesting, now the bully kid is in junior high and is all alone. The blue X's on the students face was pretty clever and imaginative. \n\nThis movie teaches us that it's more contagious to be nice than it is to be mean. It feels better and it can create a chain reaction of positivity and good. A very honest and smart look at bullying, friendship and what it means to grow up and move on. That was a really beautiful moment at the end when all the blue X's on the strangers faces fall off and then he starts to cry. He overcame his greatest fear which was to be accepted and not feel alone. Now he felt like he was a part of something with the help of his friends and family. But all this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for all the hardships they went through. Not only him but his friends as well, especially Nishimiya. It's really good commentary on adolescence and what it means to grow up. I'm glad he was able to make amends with not only Nishimiya and his friends, but more so, with himself. \n\nWonderfully animated. Very beautiful and sentimental. Really heartfelt and sweet movie. The music compliments everything beautifully. It inspired me. A really interesting and fresh look at bullying and redemption for the sins you committed. Super stylish and creative.

            "content": "A harrowing experience that leaves you with a hopeful message.\n\nNaoko Yamada's romance drama anime A Silent Voice (2016) is genuinely moving in how careful and empathetic she approaches the impact of bullying on everyone in a community. Yamada's direction is ambitious as she finds visually stimulating ways to ensure we as the audience feel actual sympathy for both the bully and the victim. You can tell she wanted viewers to understand the feelings, not just the rationale, of the deaf girl survivor of bullying. From X's on the faces of those unfriendly peers, to juxtaposing the chaotic pains of being a teenager with calm koi fish eating bread, are all brilliantly directed sequences from Yamada. I eagerly hope to see and hear more movies from Naoko Yamada.\n\nAs someone who was bullied from elementary school into high school, I definitely related to the helpless deaf girl getting relentlessly bullied by her cruel classmates. But, I was not expecting to understand and sympathize with the bully getting ostracized and outcasted to the point of wanting to commit suicide. Naoko Yamada's direction is stirling in her engaging and touching perspective on the pain and anxiety we all feel in public and private. A Silent Voice is a lowkey dramatic anime classic.\n\nReiko Yoshida's script is well written with heartfelt dialogue that I can imagine children actually saying to be mean or justify their bullying away. I was deeply worried that A Silent Voice would make excuses for bullies and forgive all cruelty and mental abuse they inflict on others. However, A Silent Voice goes out of its way to realistically depict the bully, complicit bullies, the victim, their families, and their other friends in an authentic fashion. So, you really connect and relate to each person on some level, for the kind feel uncertainty just as the wicked likewise feel a lack of self worth. A Silent Voice is sincere in tone and shockingly mature. A Silent Voice deals with heavy subject matter like teen suicide, depression, bullying, forgiveness, friendship, love, death, disability with a kind heart, gentle patience, and clear understanding of the seriousness of these issues.\n\nI should say that I saw A Silent Voice with the English Dub's excellent cast. Their dedication to sounding as genuinely in the moment is very impressive and had me immersed immediately into this sad story. Robbie Draymond is outstanding as he's casually brutal in his bullying, but tender in his affections. Lexi Marman is fantastic in a very difficult role as the deaf girl Shoko Nishimiya. Kira Buckland is perfectly cast as the ruthlessly mean girl Naoka Ueno. Her charismatic cruelty is thrilling and frightening all at once. Amber Lee Connors sounds sweet, but also pulls off Miki Kawai's curious shift of heart nicely. Sara Cravens sounds sincere and nice as Miyako Ishida with a motherly concern. Every voice actor and actress clearly gave this project the proper respect with their moving vocal performances.\n\nKengo Shigemura's absorbing editing with quick cuts and clever montages keep you engaged for all of A Silent Voice's epic 130 minutes of intense drama. All the suffering and friendship had me so deep in my feelings that I think A Silent Voice felt like 90 minutes by the end. Kazuya Takao's cinematography is creative with erratic close-ups, then suddenly jolting into a wide shot for a striking contrast in framing. Everything looks amazing with clear hand drawn animation and vivid colors, but it was the genuine emotional reactions in each character's face that hits hardest. Mutsuo Shinohara's art direction is breathtaking with lovely visual focus on the anxiety and disturbances caused by bullying.\n\nKensuke Ushio's subtle score has these pretty flourishes of melodic joy, but also finds a heartstring to pluck for the quieter moments. All the serene piano parts are tranquil, yet melancholic all the same. The shifting sounds and musical pacing fits A Silent Voice's turbulent emotional state. Youta Tsuruoka's sound design is neat with voices fading out as a character wants to zone out to distance themselves from their friends. When everyone's conversations chime in for the final scene, it's quite beautiful to hear people suddenly enjoying the festival in an amorous display of regular people finding life fun.\n\nIn all, I appreciate A Silent Voice's devastating realness for the bullying and the pain this causes afterwards. I think having a hopeful message is just the sort of optimism we could all use right now. Change into a considerate person or constantly choose to be nicer is a sentiment that I can certainly get behind. Thanks for the feelings, A Silent Voice.",

Very few movies have had that sort of impact on me, Django Unchained being the only other one I can think of. [I don't think Rope counts since it's barely an hour.] It is a powerful film; beautifully crafted in every way. The cinematography is incredible, the story is never boring, and the characters are interesting. My only complaint is that the dialogue is sometimes cheesy; but I think that is more a problem with the translation department than the writing department. The fact that Boss Baby and Ferdinand were nominated for Best Animated Feature over this is disgusting.",

The film takes a hard look at bullying and suicide, while playing off of its medium's reputation for slice of life narratives and bubblgum tones, and feels very much like a complete and compelling film. However, there are a few weaknesses, most notably in how comprehensive the redemption arcs in the film are; Ueno in particular is largely unrepentant and particularly harsh in her treatment of Nishimiya, but finds complete acceptance with the briefest moment of self-reflection. Regardless, a strong showing for director Naoko Yamada and screenwriter Reiko Yoshida, whose work is brought to life with quality animation as well. (4/5)",

Shoya Ishida is the most troublesome kid in his sixth-grade class. He pulls pranks, takes part in bullying and is known for getting into trouble. However, things come to a full circle for Shoya when Shoko Nishimiya, a shy deaf girl, transfers into his class. Shoya bullies and torments Shoko so much to the point that her mother has to transfer her to another school. Even his fellow classmates recognize this as wrong and follow up to cut all ties they once had with Shoya. Shoya spends the next 6 years living with regret and the story follows him on his journey to gain forgiveness from Shoko, his former classmates and most importantly, himself. A Silent Voice deviates from the traditional \"outcast boy and girl fall in love\" storyline. While scenes depicting romance are present between Shoko and Shoya, it is not the main focus of the film. The film has bigger fish to fry. A Silent Voice deals with the story of the mental health struggles associated with bullying from both the bully and the bullied. It also deals with the discrimination and problems that people with disabilities like Shoko faces in the everyday world. \nA Silent Voice, directed by Naoko Yamada, is worthy of its praise and is a must watch for those interested in the topic of mental health and bullying. While the film is a bit long, airing at 130 minutes, it does not fail at delivering a both a gut wrenching story about bullying and a heartwarming story about forgiveness and acceptance.",

To me it holds more of an appropriate meaning, anyway. What keeps the engagement is the suspense. Forgive the metaphor, but the film walks its characters back and forth towards the precipice of falling apart while tantalizingly giving moments of hope that things can be okay. Overall, I liked it and thought it was impactful. The one big criticism I have with it is the theme behind the X's over people's faces. It was introduced in a way that I interpreted as the MC being ostracized and feeling alone, and it was also pervasively used in a way that backed up my interpretation. However, the ending gave the X's a different meaning in that they weren't people who were ostracizing the MC or making him feel alone but rather people he literally couldn't face. It was odd since the whole time before he had no trouble facing X'd people and then suddenly he had a weird thing of needing to look at the floor or away like it was a disorder. Then there was the ending itself, when the X's all fell away was treated with importance, so much importance that it was what closed out the movie. If the film treated the meaning behind the X's consistently throughout, either as him being socially isolated or him being too afraid to face others, it would've been more impactful. The latter meaning with which the film ends with meshes more with the film's other themes. As it was, I was left genuinely confused like I'd missed something huge. Which, I guess I did. Anyway, good film.",

The writing and the dialogue of the characters is superbly written and every interaction between them characters feel genuine. The editing in the film is never spotty or out of place. Every character that isn't directly friends with or related to our main character has a large X blocking out their face, but it comes across and natural, rather than daunting, due to the fact that our lead character never looks these characters in the eye. The music is also one of the greatest parts of the film and always sets the tone for the scene. The camera shots in the film are always framed knowing what the scene is, and the context of the situation always adds to what's happening, like a character being separate from others when feeling left out, with a tree or structure separating them from the frame where everyone else in the shot is standing. The film is simply a masterpiece of film and animation that will touch even the coldest hearts.",

He has ripped the girl's hearing aids multiple times that his mom needs to pay her entire savings back to them. Now, the bully becomes the bullied, which causes him to have depression and regret everything he has done. Years later, he meets up with the girl again and apologizes for his mistakes and wants to make amends for his past. It was his journey to redemption. Over the course of a couple of weeks, he has made many friends along with the deaf girl. Then one day, his past comes back to haunt him and ruins his friendships and goes back to being alone. The detail of this movie was amazing. Everyone that he was not his friend had an \"X\" on their face to display him shutting others out. Every time he made a friend, the \"X\" would peel off. In the beginning of the movie, they added a blurry image that later showed it clearing up. This added the part of him growing and finally enjoying life.

As the movie went on I became more and more impressed by the multiple dynamics that were layered in the film. The story follows a young boy who was once bullied and thus became an expert in bullying others shortly after, especially a completely deaf classmate. However, Naoko Yamada brilliantly displays the complexities of a child who is still growing, still learning, and therefore uncertain about what role he should play. The group of classmates that he interacts with the most are also the ones that showcase different negative responses to the darker sides of reality, i.e Miss Shoko Nishimiya and her inability to hear. There are many characters in this movie, however Yamada is able to perfectly illuminate the bad characteristics in each person and the growth it can undergo. The more archetypes, the more relatable the movie spreads out to be. But what became my favorite point of the film was how the personal obstacles in one's life, (all very different yet equal in their hindrance), had the power to make one give up. Growing up as a teen who hated herself and her life, I could strongly resonate with the feelings of thinking it'd be better to rid this world of someone as troublesome as myself. This movie shows the importance of self-kindness, courage, friendship, forgiveness, and appreciating love in any of its many ways. ",

            "content": "A Silent Voice or otherwise known as its Japanese title \"the shape of a voice\" is directed by Naoko Yamada and was just recently added to Netflix. I am always excited to catch new anime shows or movies coming from around the world because when it comes to storytelling, they go places mainstream American studios are too afraid to go. The closest thing audiences will find to anime these days are indie projects coming out of studios like fox searchlight or A24. I love how movies like \"A silent voice\" continue to prove themselves better films than most box office blockbusters released these days.\nI'd first like to go into the animation by Kyoto Animation. This is the first time I believe I've seen any of their work but they are behind recognizable projects such as Violet Evergarden and a few Full Metal Panic series. The animation is crisp and beautiful, the characters movements are felt onscreen and it's just as impressive as when they convey emotion. \nThe story of a silent voice is relatable and one of the most relevant being told today as it revolves around a boy, Shoya, who bullies a deaf girl, Shoko, in elementary school to the point she has to be pulled from school. He is in turn bullied by those in his class who also took part in the bullying of the girl or stood idly by and let it happen. From that point on, Shoya is outcast from all social circles and closes himself off from everybody with a constant guard up. Careful to never let anyone in, he sees himself as worthless and a burden on his working mother so he decides to commit suicide. But before he does, he reconnects with Shoko to try to make amends with her. What follows is an emotional and somber journey of reconnecting with ones past and finding redemption. \nThere are plenty of emotional story beats that will bring you to tears and warm your heart as you watch \"A Silent Voice.\" Its powerful message about bullying and suicide make it far more relevant than ever in today's society as people grow up emotionally detached from those around them. It shows why we should be more accepting and open to other peoples differences. How the choices we make can affect more than yourself and how they can be more destructive than we realize. \nVERDICT: MUST SEE\n",

The representative heart manifests before it gets buried by shocking behavior, and the rest of the redemptive and acceptance path after the lengthy pivotal flashback prologue takes its time to uncover the said heart to build up a truly affective emotional resonance in genuine sympathy. Typical beauty for a standout anime, but this one in particular specializes in effectively stirring up emotions with the right recipe for it. (A-)\n\n(Full review TBD)",

            "content": "A Silent Voice manages to reach even those who are half a world away with its beautifully animated world, and its heart felt messages. Portraying tons of emotion in its animations and all the little details in between. The movie decides to tell a tale about forgiveness, through the heavy topics of bullying, but instead of following the bullied, A Silent Voice decides to go the unique route of following the bully's point of view. \n\tThe movie starts off with our main character Shoya Ishida, voiced by Mayu Matsuoka, climbing onto a rail of a bridge, preparing to commit suicide, but decides otherwise at the last second. This scene is a great opening, because it prepares us from the start for what we're about to experience, by showing us that this movie will have such heavy topics such as bullying and suicide, and the repercussions they have on the people around you, as a main focus. From there, we follow him through his life as he, tries to make amends for his behavior when he was in elementary school. A flash back shows him to us in his adolescence, this time voiced by Miyu Irino, living life to the fullest, when a new girl transfers to his school. This girl, named Shoko Nishimiya, voiced by Saori Hayami, is deaf and because of this, eventually becomes an outcast and bullied by the children. Saori has done an incredible job at making this deaf character, become one of the biggest parts of this movie that audience members will remember for a long time to come. The emotion she puts into every attempt Nishiyama does to talk, to the moments in which she must cry her lungs out, makes Nishiyama explode into realistic possibility in our minds. In those moments, you feel with her the struggles she has gone through, and makes you empathize with how much she is struggling to be accepted. We see a childish Ishida go from being the bully to being one bullied after Nishiyama transfers to a new school, after her mother had enough of it all. In this moment, Ishida contemplates on why everyone starts to go against him, but ultimately, comes to understand that this is what he was doing to her, and that this is what he deserves. \n\tWe come back to the present, where we see that he has become a recluse, pushing away everybody around him. This is represented by blue x's on the faces of everyone who he separates himself from. But in his guilt, he decides to try to make up for what he did to Nishiyama long ago. We follow him as he finds forgiveness from her, and slowly recovers from his loneliness by making friends. The first one he makes is called Tomohiro Nagatsuka, voiced by Kensho Ono, a chubby boy who he hesitantly helps from a bully trying to take his bike from him. From there, he makes new and old friends from trying to help out Nishiyama, becoming more extroverted and happy as a result. All the friends he makes are as memorable as they are unique in the story, and whether that be a good or bad thing, they all add to the story and help it feel less like a movie, and more like an actual group of kids just trying to live their youth. \n\tAs things start to look up, however, conflict arises, as the past is brought back up, and we must see how the youth all handle it in their own ways. Ishida specifically returns to his old habit of withdrawing himself from everyone, with the exception of Nishiyama. It is around this point where you start to realize that Ishida has decided that he will not care about what others think about him as long as he is still able to make amends for bullying Nishiyama. What follows is a sequence of events where he is desperately trying to make her happy, all the while believing that he is the one making her unhappy, and in a way, is right. Everything comes to a climax when the subject of suicide returns to bite Ishida, as well as the audience, forcing everyone in the story to rethink how they've been acting. \n\tIt is during this time of contemplation, where the main topic of more focused on, that we come to realize what the true focus of this movie: forgiveness. During these last scenes, both Ishida and Nishiyama struggle to find forgiveness from each other, and themselves, and later go to each of their other friends to ask for forgiveness. When they reach them, however, it is the other friends that ask for forgiveness, and who want to reconcile with them. The story end with Ishida finally opening up to the world, where all the x's that were on everyone around him come off at once, and he breaks down in tears. It is such a great scene, with a symphony playing grand music, and we are shown one last look at all the friends he has made. \nThroughout the movie, it may be easy to not notice the beautiful art our eyes are treated to, as you are shown the dedication that the artists and animators had in making this movie was to make it as close to perfection as possible. The little nuances of the characters make them feel less like 2D fictional characters, and more like actual living beings, with their world being beautifully drawn to not only look, but to feel like you are actually looking at a different world.\n\tThroughout the movie, Ishida goes through many ups and downs, all the while developing from a stubborn child, to a passionate teen who opens up to his friends, and eventually, to the world around him. A Silent Voice is a masterpiece that tackles the heavy subjects of suicide and bullying perfectly, giving the subjects the respect they require, while still delving deep into the struggles one has in finding forgiveness from both other and oneself. It is rare to find such a well-crafted story that draws you into a narrative so tightly drawn together, that its story flow will make you effortlessly go through each act with such ease, yet pain, that you will be confused as to why Boss Baby was nominated for the Oscar's best animation award in 2017, instead of this. I will easily recommend it to anyone and everyone who wants to see a good movie, and who aren't afraid of shedding some tears.",

Nevertheless, the overall message is not only touching and powerful, but one that should be heard by everyone. Yes, it's jam-packed with all sorts of emotional punches.

            "content": "A Silent Voice is an excellent movie that tells a story that is quite grounded and heartfelt despite being, well an anime. Some elements such as quirky charaters with unique designs are present but aside from being drawn the film never stops feeling real. Mainly due to its subject matter which admitedly can be hard to watch. that is bullying and seeing the harm it can do to people but also isn't black and white. \n\nThe main element of the story is Shoya, a former bully who is absolutely traumatized at his actions and by how he was treated by others leading to him being... well in quite a dark mindset at the beginning of the film. And its about Shoko, a deaf student whom Shoya bullied but whom is kind and gentle natured who isn't afraid to forgive those who bullied her. Yet both characters go through the emotional ringer as Shoya really tries to grow as a person beyond self blaming to someone proactive and being a good person taking responsibility. Shoko also grows and despite not being the main protagonist really does shine and carry her side of the story as someone trying to find her place. Without spoiling anything, because of her experiences growing up and how others treated her, Shoko also is in a dark headspace and grows from that through the film that is organic and heatfelt.\n\nThe movie also is not dishonest and whereas other media tackling bullying as well as the challenges of friendship and trying to form human connection can be cheesy or \"fake\" feeling, this film isn't. It doesn't shy away from it. More directly the movie is largely about \"connection\" and how really making friends and meaningful bonds with other people isn't something thats taught or explained, just expected to be known how to do automatically, which provides trouble for those who struggle with it, mainly Shoya. The film cleverly features how he percieves the world by marking other people with X's as his way of shutting out everyone else, with every connection he makes leading to the X's coming down which becomes a powerful moment later on. It also has to do with Shoko whom due to being deaf has to rely on Sign Language and writing for communcation which was a source of her bullying as a child. Later Shoya in earnestness has learned Sign in order to not only apologize to Shoko but also befriend her. Thus they form a connection that helps both of them grow as people and grow closer as friends. The film has you genuinely care for these people as well as others throughout the story as they try to form connections and grow and learn from past mistakes and its the writing that makes these 2D characters more real and honest than even some live action performances in live action films.\n\nAside from the nice character deesigns the movie is gorgeous from animation of water, leaves, flowers, to the real life inspired buildings and locales. Though many live action and CGI crafted films also bring visual splendor I would say A Silent Voice is one of the most visually pleasing movies of this year.",

            "content": "If Your Name was the tear jerking and emotionally engaging experience for everyone in 2017 and their favourite anime film, A Silent Voice was pretty much the film that filled that gap for me to end of the year strongly. And that isn't harping on Your Name even remotely, as I just rewatched it and had a fun time rewatching the film a whole lot, but I remember coming off it feeling like that romance it presented while certainly good and engaging was something I couldn't fully get into, and I felt that I wasn't gonna get any other to hopefully fill in that gap the film left behind. That was until this little gem of a film appeared, being described as a character driven anime romance and  redemption story of a elementary school bully turned incredibly suicidal and depressed teen finding and asking forgiveness from the deaf girl he bullied and inevitably made her life miserable, his close friends, and more than anything himself. And, here's something I'm gonna be blunt and upfront about that I'm currently going through right now and that I think anyone going through it can tell you: Depression, is this mental illness that's incredibly painful and rough to balance out. No matter what the person has gone through to get it, it's an incredibly rough experience to piece out but one that you start to find almost more about yourself as you go through it. In my personal experience, and don't worry this isn't to pander or make myself into a special snowflake, it's a thing I've always struggled with since i was in elementary school, and also the topic of which personally I feel is something I wish was represented properly into our entertainment medium so you can present it in a way where it's neither stereotyped, dumbed down, or even worse over-the top *cough* 13 Reasons Why *cough* But regardless, I remember when hearing about 'A Silent Voice' (while releasing the same year as Your Name wasn't as viewed but was still released to critical acclaim) and it's very intriguing premise and intriguing and well written manga, I was admittedly a bit hesitant going into it. Especially once I heard from those who watched it that the film was incredibly emotional and tear jerking, but I thought (especially when I was told the same thing about Your Name and it sadly didn't get me to that point), I wasn't gonna feel the same way from this film. 2 hours and 9 minutes of intense feels later seeing it once, I was proven wrong. Seeing it again, that still didn't even change, and now I can finally say that A Silent Voice is a film that I think for me personally is going down for both my favourite film of 2017 without a doubt right next to Blade Runner 2049 but (and I am not joking here i'm just as shocked) even in my top 10 favourite films, ever. Its just a film I just goddamn appreciate SO MUCH for balancing out such touchy themes and subject material and making it incredibly mature both in it's characters, story, and especially execution.\n\nAnd before I go any further, i do wanna preference that my liking for this film is gonna stay 100% objective and not because i'm depressed myself, as I feel then it wouldn't be appropriate to even review any film then I saw. But regardless, where A Silent Voice could've used some of its story to dig more deeper into the themes of it's story, some of its editing cuts often go to pointless shots and as a result can disrupt some of the films flow, making one or two side characters have a arc or purpose to the film, and some odd coincidences, these are really just minor nitpicks and unlike Your Name (which again need to preference I still really enjoy) it didn't have one thing that took me away from me fulling loving it. Because after seeing this film again, I not only found what I loved before still there but I was also surprised and incredibly really grateful to see the film had more things to pick up on the second time around (which I love personally when films can give me more to watch the second time I didn't pick up on) that make up the already overwhelmingly flow of positives that come from the films just incredible and beautiful hand drawn animation, memorable and sparingly used score that's both layered and has good self awareness to be used for the right scenes and not become over the top and cheesy during pivotal emotional scenes, a main plot and small sub-plots i'm glad don't distract nor are cheap in the film (and help serve   to the gripping emotion the film sets in which oh god is just mature, honest, and filled with a lot of heart), the first major strength of the film being characters i'm actually super happy to say that both from the side and main cast and are given detailed and engaging arcs, the second and major strength of the film being the romance between Shokou and Ishida both not just having such interesting arcs and most especially great chemistry as it's so goddamn engaging and sweet to watch (and rather being linear and cheesy rather treats both characters maturely) but more importantly it got big extra points that I commend this film so much for having the main lovers characters arcs be intertwined and paralleled perfectly with one another with the main theme of the film, nice reincorporation in both it's structure, scenes, and pacing, a very engaging script and story that I HAVE to seriously compliment everyone who did the film and the manga for making it well structured on its own and (must be stressed) mature especially in both Shoya and Shoko's depression arcs, and the ending I actually gotta say I really loved how it tied Shoya's main arc so well despite not following how the manga ends (which im never picky on anyways). \n\nOverall, what else can I say but that i loved this film so dearly and I can't recommend this film enough, especially if you don't mind films who deal with these real life mental health issues so bluntly and tragically and real. It's an incredibly well structured, emotional, but more importantly mature and sweet coming of age redemption story I don't think i've seen handled so well in a long time. And one that actually managed to make me tear up, which so far no film or even show has made me feel that isn't the opening to Pixar's Up, which it deserves much credit for doing. In my opinion, whether you like anime or not, I say please find time to watch whenever you can. I love it and it's a film i'm glad actually made me care about a romance for once (which i should preference, because of how well developed i've seen great films, anime, and shows do their romance and make it so well plus intertwined with telling its story it can for me personally just make me connect really well with the medium if all else fails). If this film isn't your thing, then that's perfectly alright as I think the tone and even the fact the main character starts as a bully will turn a lot of people off and it can make it hard to connect with or really like, which is totally alright. But i'll just say for me personally it connect to me a lot personally and that hopefully to others, you can connect with it also.",

            "content": "When it comes to anime, I don't find myself watching nearly enough in order to form a list of favourites, but even if I had watched everything under the moon, I still believe A Silent Voice would make the list. This is a spectacular film from start to finish. Keep in mind, this can be a very tough film to sit through for multiple reasons, and that is exactly what I'm going to dive into throughout this review, because I feel that a few precautions should be taken when going in. Here is why A Silent Voice deserves to be seen by everyone, even though it won't please everyone.\n\nAt its core, this film is about a new student that comes into a school, who just so happens to be hearing impaired. Ishida, the school bully, taunts her to the point of tears, for audiences as well. Without ruining the impact of certain scenes, I'll just say that his actions were quite Risqu\u00e9. I found myself absolutely hating his character, which was very frustrating, due to the fact that the film asks you to sympathize with him on multiple occasions. After growing up and leaving his harsh ways in the past, these two characters reconnect, forming a highly unlikely bond. A Silent Voice asks for your acceptance almost too often, but trust me, if you're in the forgiving mood, this film turns out to be extremely powerful. So that's the warning I must give you, that if you're not ready to be forgiving of a terrible actions, I'd wait until you're in the right mood to watch this movie.\n\nThroughout Ishida's transformation from a bully to a kind-hearted human being, it wasn't just the dialogue that impacted me, but the visuals surrounding him. Every time he would pass by other people that knew him, they had X's on their face. When this aspect comes into play a little later in the movie, I'd be lying if I said it didn't move me. From beginning to hate the film for displaying a very unlikable character, this story really does a great job at winning you over, especially through it's silent, visual storytelling in the background, foreground, and even anytime that it makes it blatantly obvious.\n\nWhen a movie makes you wait for it to be really good, it can be a pretty frustrating experience, but I see something different when reflecting on this film. It's all about redemption and how forgiveness is everything when you truly want to become a better person that what you were in the past. Evil is all throughout everyone, but you're not supposed to act on it. This is one of the message that I feel the movie tries to convey and I believe it's a wonderful lesson to everyone. The themes presented throughout this film are taken very seriously, so I don't think it will appeal to a younger audience, but I think older teenagers will be the perfect demographic here, for the lesson it's giving.\n\nIn the end, A Silent Voice is a film that had me hating throughout the first act, realizing I was wrong throughout the second act, and on the verge of tears throughout the third act, due to how well this movie does a complete 180. With a powerful story, a final sequences that will have many in tears, and an overall film that is worthy of awards, I can't recommend this enough. That being said, I can't get myself to give this movie a perfect score, due to the fact that I think it took a little too long to win me over. I found myself disliking the movie throughout the majority of it, until my eventual realization, which is my one warning, so I feel I won't be alone on that. A Silent Voice is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year.",

            "content": "A Silent Voice - Review (2017 for America)\n\nThis is a beautiful Anime Film from Naoko Yamada based on the Manga \n\nThe ripple effects of bullying come back to haunt a high school student years later \u00e2?? and over the course of two ambitiously overstuffed hours \u00e2?? in A Silent Voice (Koe no katachi), which was adapted from the popular manga series by Yoshitoki Oima.\n\nPacked with drama, laughter, tears and at least two suicide attempts, this third animated feature from director Naoko Yamada (Tamako Love Story) does its best to condense a seven-volume series into one feature-length film, though it tends to suffer under the weight of so much material.\n\nImpressive in the way it takes a single incident and shows how it can damage both the victims and the perpetrators for a long time to come, the story (written for the screen by Reiko Yoshida) follows Shoya Ishida, a taciturn teenage boy who tries to jump off the bridge at the start of the film. Soon after, we learn that when he was back in sixth grade, Shoya terrorized a new classmate named Shoko Nishimiya, a deaf-mute girl who couldn\u00e2??t be more gentle and kind, even when she\u00e2??s the brunt of everyone\u00e2??s jokes.\nA decade later, Shoya has never managed to shed the bully label of his youth, becoming an outcast in his own right who\u00e2??s now shunned by the rest of his school. He tracks down Shoko, who he hasn\u00e2??t seen since they were kids, in the hopes that she will pardon his terrible behavior. Their very long and awkward friendship \u00e2?? or courtship, if you can call it that \u00e2?? occupies the majority of the film, with the two damaged souls searching for some kind of solace in each other\u00e2??s company. But communication between them is not that simple, even if Shoya tries to learn sign language, while the lasting effects of their trauma seem to leave permanent wounds.\n\nLike a very dark and twisted Mean Girls, Silent Voice chronicles the cruelty and isolation of Shoya, Shoko and their friends or frenemies in ways that can sometimes grow exhausting, with several moments of major drama \u00e2?? and a few hair-raising stunts \u00e2?? punctuating the narrative. These are definitely some highly emotional adolescents, melting under the sinister looks of others or hurling themselves into a local river without warning. A few stabs at humor involving Shoya\u00e2??s newfound buddy, Tomohiro Nagatsuka, help to lighten the overall tone, but while the film has lots of qualities, subtlety definitely isn\u00e2??t one of them.\n\nWhere director Yamada excels is in depicting the interior worlds of the two main characters, paying particular attention to details, whether visual or sonic, that seem to place a constant divide between Shoya and Shoko. In one sequence, he creeps up behind her and she only realizes he\u00e2??s there when a bunch of pigeons suddenly fly away. In another, he places his hand on a railing, and the reverberations signal his presence to a waiting Shoko. And when Shoya becomes the school loser himself, he sees everyone else with a big \u00e2??X\u00e2?? across their face, as if they\u00e2??ve become abstract manifestations of his own rejection.\n\nAlongside the rich animation work by Futoshi Nishiya, the sound design by Yota Tsuruoka and Hiromune Kurahashi uses lots of ambiance to contrast the audible life of Shoya with the silent one of Shoko. It\u00e2??s such a chasm that seems to keep them apart, while their shared positions as teenage pariahs \u00e2?? not to the mention the fact that neither of them seems to have a father figure in their life \u00c2\u00ad\u00e2?? is what ultimately may unite them.\n\nOverall: I Love this film I can see why it can qualify for Oscars it just punches you in the gut. \n\nOverall Grade: A",

The depiction of change and transformation are portrayed differently in all major and minor characters. When watching,  notice the background sound, the quietness and the stillness. Also, the symbolism of water is also important. These details give additional meaning to the story such as the koi-fish, the rain, and river. However, one must require to do more research to truly understand Japanese symbolism on these elements. \n\nFor simple movie watcher, then these elements are clearly depicted: depression, friendship, and forgiveness. Needless to say more, go watch the anime. \n\nOverall, it is worth 5 stars for a masterful writing and story-telling (it is based on a manga by the way). What are you waiting for? Go watch it!",

The use of sign language in an animated movie was refreshing. We deserve more movies like this in the world. I pray that when it gets released in America that it gets nominated at awards because it deserves a lot more attention that it currently has. The themes of the movie are easy for people to resonate with and feel like they can relate to the characters and their struggles to deal with bullying, getting over the past and depression etc.\nIf you have a member of family who is disabled or you yourself are disabled then you will feel a lot more emotion towards this movie even more.

            "content": "A second chance to fix the past mistake.\n\nThis is the next best anime in the recent time after 'Your Name'. Not that you know this director very well, not at the international level. But with a film like this, she's going to be. This is another teen romance. Well, romance is not exactly a word that matches with what this film is about narrative, but there's no other way to describe its theme. It was like before romance, that mean before committing to a relationship and after you had started to like someone while fixing the mistakes made in the past.\n\nIt's a high school tale. Before that, it opened with a brief flashback of the elementary school events, where Shoya Ishida bullied a new admission Shoko Nishimiya for her hearing impairment. Soon after that, she'd transferred to another school. Now, a few years later, they meet again in the high school, where Ishida tried to fix what he had done wrong a while ago for her. So a relationship develops, despite people around them does not understand their commitment. At some point, it will be tested, which might lead to uncover their true feeling to one another.\n\nThis is surely aimed at the teen audience. Especially, the romance and sentimental parts are intended for the youngsters, but anyone would enjoy it. So, I felt them, but not like I'm still young. Otherwise, I would have said it is a masterpiece. That's only from the story perspective. The sketches and animations were not bad. The film characters were awesome. Each one was very unique and different people pick different characters as their favourite. I liked Yuzuru as I always like tomboyish type roles. But obviously Ishida and Shoko make this film.\n\n?Please don't make such a serious face. And, let me say... I am sorry.?\n\nSmooth animation. Technically comparable with any big names (anime titles). That also means the director is now in the league of the best anime-maker. She's young and I hope she keeps doing more films. As I said many times before, that after Hayao Miyazaki retired from making films, we need more people like this filmmaker to fill that empty space. The film won many awards for its great achievement, as well as box office success in the domestic market. Expecting the rest of the world and anime fans to receive it at the same extent.\n\nIt was originally based on the manga of the same name, and a television series was made before this feature anime. As I collect film quotes, the best ones, I was disappointed on that context. There were many emotionally and romantically appealing lines, but not on the moral perception. That does not mean the film lacks the social consciousness. In fact, the film highlights the bullying and its severe consequences. That alone is enough, this is a must see for the school kids.\n\nSurely kids, teens and some youngsters would love it, but as far as the adults, this is not an ideal thematic, yet you can't ignore its artistry and the intention of the film. Sometimes it might help you to like it in the second viewing. Because this is one of those kind. My issue was understanding the Japanese sign language. Besides, the subtitle for that was not much helpful, as it was exactly translated as what the hearing impaired character babbled which is an alternate spelling for every word and sentence.\n\nI had lots of fun watching it, as well as other moods like romantic, touching, annoyance, but overall it leans towards the good side. Just over two hours, it never looked too slow or hurried in the story or the character developments. Could be the best to pick as a date flick or get together with your school friends, particularly opposite sex friends. My final saying is, it is not to be missed for many reasons I've mentioned in this review and the other one is it being an anime, a quality one.\n\n7/10",

            "content": "Ok look so if you haven't figured it out by now, I genuinely have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. That statement might as well be written on the side of the 'Spirit St.Louis' given how up in the air it seems to be, but regardless its how I write these reviews. I can't even fall back on calling myself a critic here because one needs to actually understand what it means to \"criticize\" something and yet I still wonder why I'm not a Top Critic on Rotten Tomatoes. Probably because I fail on almost every aspect to critically write something, instead I use these reviews as a mean of catharsis, whether anyone reads them is besides the point. So how could I possibly avoid swearing at every turn and telling you just how much movies like \"A Silent Voice\" genuinely fucking moved me to such an extent that just thinking about it gets me emotional in so many ways. The term 'Anime' evokes expressionistic flights of genre filmmaking, yet A Silent Voice takes away the Fantasy element from that of my favourite movie of 2016's Your Name, and digs deeper into Slice of life and coming of age. \n\nSo at this point it feels unnecessary to say A Silent Voice/The Shape of Voice (Koe no Katachi) was an extremely present surprise. I'm what most people would consider an innocent or a virgin when it comes to anime since my sporadic love of this genre came from just watching 1 film back in December. So in that I after watching Kimi no na wa for the 3rd time I was left kind of empty, in need to feel an emotional void that simply couldn't be replaced. In this I found A Silent Voice...the manga. On that day I went to 4 different shops to hunt down the 7 volumes this series had and only successfully found 4 of them in the wrong order. And after I spent the next 2 days reading the copies I had and the rest I didn't online, I couldn't help but feel the massive pit of disappointment I felt after realising it was no where near as great as everyone claimed it to be. So you must understand despite knowing the plot and walking into this movie with a moderate sense of expectations, I ended up crying and applauding my way with the rest of the audience until the credits had finally stopped rolling. And even then I struggled to get out of my seat if it wasn't for this girl I had been sitting next to and flirting with through the screening since being the hopeless and senseless clich\u00e9 romantic that I am, I wanted to get her number. A Silent Voice has a premise so effective in relating to real life situations and yet so simple that I spent most of my time wondering just how no one decided to put it in an Anime let alone a Movie. Probably because the morality of the film borders on every good, bad and morally grey area possible. Its a coming of age story yet not the one you would not expect. \n\nIf you don't know about now (I doubt you are reading this cause you actually like the review) A Silent Voice is about a teen boy (Shoya Ishida), lost in his life and opens up with him about to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. By all means, its exactly what he deserves. Within 15 minutes the film had me cry as it shows a quick but essential backstory into Shoya's life in which he severely bullies a death girl named Shoko in primary school. Shoya by all means deserves all the punishment, guilt, hate, and anger he gets for what he did...or does he? There's one thing that Shoya must do before he kills himself, find redemption in the girl who he's hurt most, Shoko Nishimiya. And sometimes, finding redemption is so simple as to learning to just...listen. \n\nWhile carrying romantic themes, this is by no means a romantic movie. This film dives deep into emotional territory, touching on teen suicide, love, bullying, disability, friendship, death, and learning to live with your mistakes. Anyone who says they don't have regrets is simply a liar, we all regret something. Some more than others, something we wish we could change, that's what makes us different from everyone else. Choosing on how we act on those regrets and past mistakes. This, is what makes A Silent Voice so special, especially with its characters. I was lucky enough to see this film on the 15th of March (Yes it did take me over a month to write this) when it was released here for 1 day, in that I also had the best audience available, one that felt and understood every struggle and emotion in every moment and laughed at every simple but cleverly used joke, a crowd which despite me getting to the cinema 15 minutes early that the line stretched around the entire block. A whole community dying to see this film. A crowd which applauded at what I can only say is very simply a masterpiece in story telling and film making. Not just animation, film making. The film rarely seems able to look its characters directly in the eye, and its gaze often wanders to rest on telling incidental details, like anxiously clasped hands and nervously scuffing feet.\u00a0\n\nThis film was simply made for Anime, that does not mean though that none Anime lovers should not see this film...when its DVD Release is in December. Yes there is drama, and melodrama at that. Yet it follows some clich\u00e9 romantic patterns, yes it's representation isn't the newest in Hollywood.  But it remains intriguingly in flux. The Director Yamada, makes a point of contrasting the agonising complexity of high-school life with the clean simplicity of the moments that really count: hushed conversations on a bridge in springtime, a shared roller-coaster ride under empty blue skies.\u00a0\n\nThe bully, rather than his victim, remains the focus of the story throughout never really feels YOLO like the risky narrative strategy that you realise it must have been in retrospect. Compared to, say, the metaphysical leaps and bounds of Your Name, the premise of A\u00a0Silent\u00a0Voice\u00a0may seem modest as it never truly focuses on Shoko the death protagonist. But its approach leads an old story down a little-trod, and damn right beautiful path. Something that earns this rating, and damn right deserves to be watched.",

I was also a little surprised to find out it was also based on a manga by Yoshitoki Oima. The film itself is an endearing tale of living one's life as a young person being affected by regrets and opening up to the world in a more brighter manner than before, but it's also about atonement and reconciling with one's consequences of their actions. The character's are relatable as they are touching, carrying the film through it's compelling plot especially with the main character himself and the deaf girl who he's trying to understand. In the end it's not surprising the characters learn something more about themselves as well as their relationships with others in order to lead more happier lives. The animation is unique and top class to say the very least not the most outstanding especially for it's environments though it does a superb at blurring the line between imagination and reality. Even if the success of 'Your Name' is to suggest one piece of anime was huge, this deserves just as much attention as it does acclaim, I have no regrets watching this film and I encourage people of all demographics to seek out and see for themselves.",

The amount of minor characters is overkill, and to a western viewer, some of the nuances of the niceties in the many relationships can seem slightly oblique when viewed through the Japanese tendency towards understatement and heightened manners. By the time it ended, I was struggling to keep track of who everyone was, and where they fit into the whole thing. It had some nice moments, but if I see it again (not hugely likely) Ill pay a heap more attention to the links between the characters.

            "content": "For those of you who have seen last year's Your Name and, like myself, place that in your top films of 2016, I cannot urge you enough to watch this delightful anime that is elegantly adorable and equally heartbreaking, flooding me with a range of emotions I haven't felt since my school years. The anxiety, the depression, the constant need to feel accepted and liked. Sometimes it takes a film to help remind us what it was like, to teach us those forever important lessons of love, respect and friendship. \n\nThe superbly crafted Anime is based on Yoshitoki Oima's titular manga, or \"The Shape of the Voice\" which was originally an one-shot in 2011 before getting a full weekly serialisation running from August 2013 till November 2014; which was supported by the Japanese Federation of the Deaf, winning a number of recognised awards.\n\nThe story feels central to Shoya Ishida, who is the classic example of the school bully. Cruel, insecure and disobedient whose only existence is dependable on his popularity among his friends. His story is suddenly entwined with Shoko Nishimaya, a shy, sweet and deaf schoolgirl who is transferred to his elementary school. She desperately wants to make friends with everyone, including Ishida, who cannot accept or understand her brave and continual proposal of friendship and as a result, she becomes the focal point of his nasty behaviour. Her tolerance and perseverance is incredibly admirable but forms part of a vicious circle as the more she forgives, the worse he torments her. \n\nYou cannot help feeling deeply sympathetic for her, arousing terrible mistakes and guilt I, myself made during my adolescent years, which instead of hating Ishida's character, I instead ending up relating to him to some degree. She is eventually transferred again when Ishida goes too far, leaving him with blame and ironically becomes the next victim as a result of how he treated her and others. \n\nYears later, skipping junior school, Ishida is now a shell of his former shelf, being completely ostracised, he is now an isolated high school teenager who has little to do with anyone else. Friendless, sad and feeling tremendous regret for his past behaviour, he tries to come to terms with the guilt, accepting the punishment that has been dealt to him. Fate steps in and he catches a glimpse of Nishimaya leading to an awkward encounter that sets off a chain of events of redemption, friendship, understanding and forgiveness. \n\nThe story delves deeper, as a number of individual yet stereotypical characters flit in and out of their story, but each of them having a fundamental impact on the outcome. The resentful Ueno, Ishida's popular, domineering secret admirer; Kawai, the school's narcissistic academic who can't do no wrong. Sahara, the shy and only girl to befriend Nishimaya at elementary school; and quite a few more. \n\nThe film tackles some very mature themes such as suicide, depression and social interaction, displaying how our troubled adolescence can help shape us into our adult selves as we watch both lead characters try to find their way in life, desperately wanting to fit in. There's a wealth of emotions here, covering a broad spectrum of feelings but remaining charming throughout. \n\nThe animation is glorious with some clever and symbolic imagery to help convey Ishida's isolation and a good representation of \"what goes around comes around.\" It's superbly balanced and paced for a film of 129 minutes, making the film very compelling and enticing with Kensuke Ushio providing a typical yet beautiful score of minimalistic piano and chimes that grows throughout the film to help signify the progressive understanding between the characters. \n\nIt's a powerful and profound story that's superbly put together, reminding me exactly why I love films  and of my own childhood relationships. A must- watch, especially for fans of delicate anime. \n\nRunning Time: 8\nThe Cast: 9\nPerformance: 9\nDirection: 10\nStory: 10\nScript: 10\nCreativity: 10\nSoundtrack: 10\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being an absolutely stunning masterpiece in every sense. \n\n96% 10/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

Seeing a bully as the main character also feels very refreshing, as you get to see the story from his point of view, rather than a protagonist.\n\nA Silent Voice has an excellently developed main character, a relationship between the two main leads you feel invested in, great animation, mature themes that are handled with care and some truly moving scenes (especially in the final act).\n\nI hope this film gets more recognition, just like last year's Your Name.
