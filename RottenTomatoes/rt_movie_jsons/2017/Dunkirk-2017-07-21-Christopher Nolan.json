    "summary": "In May 1940, Germany advanced into France, trapping Allied troops on the beaches of Dunkirk. Under air and ground cover from British and French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated from the beach using every serviceable naval and civilian vessel that could be found. At the end of this heroic mission, 330,000 French, British, Belgian and Dutch soldiers were safely evacuated.",

            "content": "\"Dunkirk,\" directed by Christopher Nolan, is a World War II film that tells the story of the evacuation of British and Allied forces from the beaches of Dunkirk, France, in 1940. The film is a masterful example of visual storytelling, with a stunning visual and auditory experience that immerses the viewer in the intensity and chaos of the evacuation.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of \"Dunkirk\" is its non-linear narrative structure. The story is told through three interwoven timelines, each representing a different perspective of the evacuation: soldiers on the beach, pilots in the air, and civilians on boats crossing the English Channel. This approach creates a sense of tension and urgency, as the viewer is left to piece together the events and understand the wider context of the evacuation.\n\nThe film's cinematography, courtesy of Hoyte van Hoytema, is breathtaking. The use of large format cameras and practical effects creates a visceral and realistic experience that captures the enormity of the evacuation. The wide shots of the beach, the close-ups of the soldiers' faces, and the breathtaking aerial dogfights are all visually stunning and add to the film's overall impact.\n\nThe film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is also a standout feature. The score features a haunting and relentless ticking sound, which adds to the film's tension and urgency. Zimmer's music is a critical element of the film's emotional impact, providing a powerful and effective backdrop for the action on the screen.\n\nThe cast, which includes Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, and Fionn Whitehead, all deliver strong performances. Despite the minimal dialogue and character development, the actors convey the desperation, fear, and hopelessness that define the evacuation of Dunkirk.\n\nIn summary, \"Dunkirk\" is a remarkable achievement in visual storytelling. The film's non-linear narrative structure, stunning cinematography, haunting score, and powerful performances combine to create an immersive and emotional experience that transports the viewer to the heart of one of the most significant events in modern history. Christopher Nolan's masterful direction and attention to detail make \"Dunkirk\" a must-see movie for anyone interested in cinema or history.",

Everything is exceptional whether it be the editing, sound, directing, etc. My only problem is the characters are just okay and the story is a bit messy to follow. I know the characters are the 400,000 men waiting to get home so It feels like a silent protagonist but it makes it less enjoyable to watch when the characters highlighted within those 400,000 are just not interesting",

            "content": "\"Dunkirk\" is a 2017 war/action movie directed by Christopher Nolan. The film tells the story of the Dunkirk evacuation, a pivotal event in World War II, from the perspectives of soldiers, pilots, and civilians who were caught up in the conflict.\n\nOne of the strengths of this film is its impressive use of non-linear storytelling. The movie jumps back and forth between different timelines and perspectives, creating a sense of tension and urgency that is both engaging and thought-provoking. The cinematography is also top-notch, with stunning aerial shots and impressive use of practical effects to create a sense of authenticity and realism.\n\nThe acting in the film is solid, with notable performances from Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, and Kenneth Branagh. The actors do an excellent job of conveying the emotions and experiences of their characters, without resorting to overly dramatic or contrived performances.\n\nThe music by Hans Zimmer is also a standout feature of the film, adding a sense of urgency and tension that complements the action and visuals perfectly.\n\nOne potential weakness of the film is its lack of character development. While the movie does an excellent job of conveying the physical and emotional toll of war, it doesn't give much insight into the individual motivations or personalities of the characters. However, this is a deliberate choice by the director, who wanted to emphasize the broader themes of survival and sacrifice.\n\nOverall, \"Dunkirk\" is a masterful and intense war/action movie that manages to be both gripping and thought-provoking. Its impressive use of non-linear storytelling, stunning cinematography, and excellent musical score make it a must-see for fans of the genre.",

They used quite a few different camera techniques that changed the ratio from full screen to wide view for different scenes. Alot of the scenes rely on its visuals and sounds to create an emotional impact. Sometimes there is scenes that has no dialogues between the characters. It isn't a movie with back stories about characters but starts in the middle of their survival, which many people didn't like about this because they expected something different, rather than just to follow characters on their survival. Personally I think Christopher Nolan did absolutely superbly, maybe not for Tom Hardy, like what was he saying? I'm sure Tommy was taking a major dump after all this. The actors really acted their characters well I didn't see them as actors at all what so ever only the characters, and I didn't know it was Harry Styles, like what? For it's cinematography and it's surrealism sound, how can I not give this a high score. This is based on soldiers at war evacuating at Dunkirk, I wasn't there, I don't know what it's like being a Soldier but it's not a blockbuster that has to have one character with dramatic lines, no one is going to be quoting Shakespeare during battle. This movie is definitely one of my favorites.",

It frequently jumps around time, which can be quite confusing. For some people this use of time jumps could enhance the viewing experience, but it could certainly be seen as needlessly confusing. Nonetheless, the movie is one of Nolan's finest. Definitely recommend!",

Upon first viewing, this movie can be needlessly confusing, which is nothing new for a Nolan film but where movies like Interstellar, Inception, or Memento can benefit from being a little confusing forcing the audience to figure it out themselves. But a war film like Dunkirk doesn't really benefit from this style of storytelling, it's a very suspenseful movie at times but loses all of that by not delivering on any consequences for the characters.",

            "content": "\"Dunkirk\", at least for me, is the perfect example that cinema is not only made with technical aspects. The film is undeniably well acted and photographed, and the sound work is excellent, but it's so, so, SO BORING! Hans Zimmer tries to accentuate the drama and the tension with the soundtrack, but it didn't work for me, I'm sorry. It's also hard to talk about the performances, as nobody here is memorable or highlighted. Harry Styles (whose presence annoyed me a lot) is just a soldier, like Fionn Whitehead and Aneurin Barnard. Cillian Murphy is just a man in a panic, Tom Hardy exists as a pilot, and so does Jack Lowden. Incredible as it may seem, I think the most memorable character is the Commander, made by Kenneth Branagh. KENNETH. BRANAGH. The film has three parallel narratives, each one with different duration: the mole, one week; the sea, one day; the air, one hour. The transitions between them are a bit problematic, I found myself lost in time several times, not only in time but also during an aerial fight; fortunately, the air battle problem is solved from the second onwards. If I was involved with the story (the \"story\" is actually \"watch this war from different points of view for 1h46min), \"Dunkirk\" could be an amazing sensorial experience, like both \"Blade Runner\" movies were, or an even better comparison (with another war film), like \"1917\" was, but, unfortunately, this is not what happened. I recognize the extraordinary technical job, but it's not enough. It's almost unbelievable that after doing a potentially emotionally powerful movie (\"Interstellar\"), Christopher Nolan did an almost empty one.",

            "content": "¿es Dunkerque la mejor obra maestra de Christopher Nolan? ¿acaso merecía más el óscar a mejor película del 2017 en vez de la forma del agua? \nPues bien, Dunkerque, es una OBRA MAESTRA. Ambientada en los años 40 en plena segunda guerra mundial, nos narra la ''operación dinamo'', la cual fue una misión de rescate, para sacar a casi 400.000 soldados ingleses de la ciudad francesa de Dunkerque, la cual se encontraba azotada por los alemanes. Lo más genial de esta película es: absolutamente todo; primero que  nada, Nolan nos narra la historia desde tres perspectivas distintas, un soldado que intenta escapar, tres civiles que en su pequeño barco pesquero intentarán rescatar de las aguas a la mayor cantidad de soldados, y un piloto de avión; es interesante cómo logra capturar una experiencia bélica vívida gracias a sus bien cuidados aspectos cómo lo son sus magistrales efectos de sonido o una fotografía con muy buenos planos secuencia; gracias a que es una película con escaso diálogo, permite a Nolan mostrarnos una historia en vez de contárnosla y aunque eso ya es toda una hazaña, no se compara con la osada realización al momento de recrear cada detalle, una de las cosas que hace que se sienta tan real cada momento bélico, es que el CGI(efectos visuales generados por computadora) es ausente, me atrevería a decir que todos los efectos especiales son reales, las decisiones tomadas en cuanto a utilizar réplicas de aviones y barcos REALES de la época, más el desafío de filmar en mar abierto y en el mismo lugar en el que ocurrieron los eventos reales, el diseño de los escenarios, vestuarios y otros elementos, hacen de esta un logro en cuanto a producción y dirección, y una obra visual y estéticamente significativa. El montaje es un punto verdaderamente fuerte en esta producción, cada corte es usado a favor de la trama (como en toda película), pero esta usa cada corte de cierta manera que no puedo describir con palabras... porque simplemente ha sabido extraerlas de mi boca para que sea usted el que se de cuenta de ello, solo diré que no había visto el poder del montaje tan bien usado desde pelis como \"memento\"(también de Christopher Nolan) o \"seven: los siete pecados capitales\"(de David Fincher), películas que también recomiendo  demasiado. Pasando a la parte interpretativa, todos se lucen muy bien en sus papeles, entre la cuantiosa cantidad de excelentes interpretaciones que aparecen en la cinta, destacaría la magistral interpretación de Cillian Murphy, que aunque su tiempo en pantalla es muy corto, hace un trabajo que está a la altura, no me puedo ir sin hablar también de las actuaciones de Mark Rylance, Jack Lowden, Fionn whitehead y Harry Styles. La banda sonora compuesta por el ganador del óscar, el gran Hans Zimmer, refuerza el suspenso y es verdaderamente intrigante. En síntesis, Dunkerque es una epopeya de emociones, detallada, realista y llena de suspenso. Para mí es la segunda mejor de Nolan solo por detrás de ''el origen'', y desde luego que merecía el óscar que le quitó ''la forma del agua'', que también estuvo súper buena, pero no a la altura de esta. 9/10",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.\n\n'Dunkirk' had me interested in it from the get go. Not just because Nolan was the director, though he is to me one of the \"appreciated\" directors than a personal favourite, and, while all his films range from decent to outstanding, again from personal opinion only 'Memento' is a film without faults, so like him and his films but don't consider them the best thing since sliced bread. There was also the involvement of Hans Zimmer, who has penned some great scores (both in his collaborations with Nolan, being a regular, and elsewhere) and a cast that includes Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy. Plus 'Dunkirk' was based off one of the most disastrous events in British wartime history, actually cited by Winston Churchill as \"a colossal military disaster\".\n\nSeeing 'Dunkirk', after hearing a lot of acclaim but also a lot of divisive opinions on both sides, there was a lot to admire about 'Dunkirk' but, although it is a visual, technical, audio and directorial masterpiece, it is not the triumph of film-making it could have been. As far as Nolan's films go for me it's a lesser effort, meaning often impressive but flawed where ambition gets in the way of execution, feel exactly the same way about 'Interstellar' which has similar strengths and flaws to 'Dunkirk'. Personally do feel strongly that regardless of how disappointing it would have been to others it is a long way from a 1/10 film, even if the film didn't do much for me it would have gotten a 4 at least from me.\n\nLet's start with the strengths first. First off, 'Dunkirk' looks amazing, so far being one of the best-looking films of the year. Very evocatively designed, atmospherically lit and the cinematography is dazzling with some grit but also some audaciousness. Nolan's direction is often superb, especially in the very visceral spectacle, and on an audio level it is just as big a triumph. The sound is constant but didn't bother me, coming from somebody who can have hyper-sensitive hearing but is used to loud noises and high volume (necessary for the experience) when going to the cinema. If anything it added to the authenticity.\n\nHans Zimmer's score has garnered a lot of praise, acclaimed from most in part, but has had some dissenting opinions. Count me in as someone who loved it, there is an ominous quality but also a pathos and rousing bombast that enhances the pulsating heart-beat.\n\nThe action is often enthralling, and there is some nerve-shredding tension and some heart-wrenching emotional pathos (like in Cillian Murphy's performance). Loved the performances as well, the best coming from a quietly dignified and understated Mark Rylance who can say little and still speak volumes with just a small gesture, his eyes and his facial expressions. Kenneth Branagh's role is not a large one but he does make much of it. Nolan regulars Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy command the screen effortlessly, Murphy's shell-shocked soldier in particular is genuinely moving. Was absolutely shocked in a good way at how good Fionn Whitehead's and Harry Styles (on paper an insane casting choice) feature film debuts were.\n\nOn the other hand, what makes 'Dunkirk' less than triumphant is that the characterisation, writing and story are on the messy side. Didn't mind the minimal dialogue and understood completely why it was done, did mind that the characters were underdeveloped and severely lacking in depth, one never gets to know them which is a shame because the acting is so good.\n\n'Dunkirk' has been criticised for being emotionally cold and not getting enough into the horrors of war. Do agree with those criticisms actually. There are times actually where both actually come through, there is tension and suspense, there are some harrowing moments and some poignant ones, but we don't want moments, we want consistency. 'Dunkirk' is not horrifying or gut-wrenching enough (for war films it is fairly tame) and does lack consistent emotional investment.\n\nNolan could have done more with the historical side of things, it is a good thing that a good deal of people here have knowledge of the event but it can't be assumed that everybody knows about it or all the facts, nobody expects a history lesson but there was a missed opportunity in this regard. While being a technical and visual masterpiece, some of the editing is chaotic in places, as an epileptic it was just about bearable but still felt too much even for what it was trying to do. Lastly, while having a non-linear structure is not a bad thing (Nolan did it with 'Memento' and masterfully) how the three stories were told did get confused at times and it was hard keeping up with the constant back and forth.\n\nSo overall, less than triumphant but hardly disastrous. Often impressive but problematic. 6.5-7/10 Bethany Cox",

The acting was great and the action was thrilling. The cinematography throughout was captivating and the story mostly kept you hooked. I also loved how visually appealing the movie was and the dedication that was put into the making of it. The problem I have, however, is that the film tries to make itself unnecessarily more intelligent, where it tries to throw in a unique way of telling the story that just doesn't seem to work and makes the film sluggish at parts. While this has worked very well with other Nolan films in the past (Inception, Interstellar, Memento), \"Dunkirk\" didn't really need to feel as convoluted and hard to follow as it ended up being. Overall, this is still a very great film and a much more mature war film than others, but it still tries to reach much higher than it probably should've, and the film could've been much more simplified to make it easier to digest.",

It struck me that this film was not so much about courage as it was about sacrifice.  The ending where we hear(as read) Churchill's address to the Bristish nation is equally compelling, and a message for world leaders of today.  The sacrifice of hero's is no small matter and Christopher Nolan does a wonderful job here of letting it play out.

It's just bland and half-empty and mostly pointless. Same content could have easily been presented in a 1-hour cut, and it'd have been be easier to watch - less of a waste of time.\n\nAlso, it joins the likes of Transformers 2 and Snowpiercer etc. in being the victim of a certain psychopathology going around in Hollywood that makes their editors impoverish the colors of the movie and make them all revolve around Teal and Orange (many things that should be grey are actually greenish/teal, even white shirts have a teal hue to them; anything wooden or warm-color textile will be a shade of orange; hardly any blue or magenta or true red or true yellow to be found anywhere). I thought the Teal and Orange insanity might be dying out, but it seems not - Hollywood is still holding on to this idiocy.\n\nI watched this on HBO, so I had complete control over the sound volume the whole time. I guess that nullified the most impressive part of the movie: the unnecessarily loud soundtrack (to where even some veterans commented that the movie might have been louder than the actual war). But the Industry can pat itself on the back, I guess: once again it has fabricated another \"blockbuster\" for itself, complete with paid-for favorable reviews and awards.",

From the very beginning of the film, the audience is thrown right into the fray of three storylines revolving around the evacuation and never truly allowed a rest. From dodging German bullets in the streets, cowering from dive-bombers on the beaches, and having ships sink from under us, to sailing to Dunkirk as a civilian volunteer, to flying a Spitfire fighter trying to protect the operation from German aircraft, the legend of Dunkirk is explored superbly. The immersion is very much helped by the film being shot at Dunkirk itself in the ground storyline, on open water for the sea storyline, and in the air with genuine World War II warbirds in the air storyline. There are some elements that detracted from the film, however. Director Christopher Nolan's aversion to CGI makes the filmed experience impeccable but forces the film to include a Dunkirk far too intact and clean than it was in real life, anachronistic ships, and too few men to truly resemble the real Dunkirk.

I remember when my mom bought me a DVD player for my bedroom when I was a teen, before most people had one in their living rooms. I say that because as a someone who loves film it's hard to explain to people the difference between films you like, films you love, and films you feel people have to see. I try not to waste people's time so I choose to mention the last category. Dunkirk is such a film. \n\nI need to carefully choose where to start. Why do I love this film? For starters there is how unusual it is. Upon watching this film you may not notice but this is one of the weirdest war movies ever made. Most war films have large battle sequences. Dunkirk is a character driven film set during a war. Think \"Saving Private Ryan\" (another film everyone must see,) but as a suspense thriller character piece where the war is outside the story. This film only wants you to care for the characters and not the action. It's weird, it's contradictory to studio thinking, and it's counter productive to any film maker looking to make money, but it is genius. \n\nThe second thing I love is the time jumps. Upon first watching this film I didn't understand the time jumps and I didn't fully appreciate the film. It's actually three films. It's a film about a port which takes place during the course of a week. It's a film about a boat captain going to rescue troops which takes place during a day. Last, it's a film about a fighter pilot which takes place during an hour. This is Nolan. Every film Nolan manages to bend time and perplex his audience during at least a couple of sequences. This time he does it for the entire film. \n\nThe last thing I love about this film is the characters and the themes. This isn't a war film that glorifies war. This isn't a film about heroes, even though there are a couple. This is a film that shows human beings in a situation where they will most likely die and it revels in the tension and passions that rise up from such a situation. This is one of the finest scripts ever filmed carried by some really great performances. Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, even fucking Harry Styles is knocking it out of the park. This movie has some amazing acting in it and it's backed up by an amazing director with an amazing script. \n\nSee this movie.",

            "content": "Dunkirk: Hope in the midst of loss.\n\nThis week I'll be taking a look at the stunning war film Dunkirk. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, it features a large ensemble cast including Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and Tom Hardy. The film recounts the historical events of the evacuation of the French town of Dunkirk after it had been surrounded by the German forces, trapping more than 400,000 British soldiers on the beaches. The narrative follows three different perspectives of the event; young soldiers trapped on the beach, one of the many civilian vessels that sailed toward Dunkirk on a rescue mission and two pilots trying to protect British ships from German Luftwaffe planes. The thing that struck me the most from the outset of this film is the incredible technical achievement that it is and especially in nonlinear visual storytelling. The editing especially is so precise, well paced and consistent that even though the three story lines are happening at different times and sometimes even overlap,  the flow of the narrative is never confusing or very hard to follow. Using barely any computer generated effects, there was no cheating on the structure and flow of the film's visuals and it presented a unique challenge to the editing team. Incorporating a complex element of balancing a weeks worth of action for the land, a day for the sea and an hour for the air added to the list of unique challenges bringing the film together would pose. Overall I was struck by how great the post production was on this film and how necessary being great was for the film to actually work. Making a film that breaks so many narrative rules and structures into a powerful yet still entertaining blockbuster is a feat that only spot on editing could have accomplished. Large and sweeping in scope while maintaining a sense of dire urgency and dread, the film deftly balances it's numerous elements to create a truly engrossing and moving experience. With time running out and losses getting heavier, the film portrays the situation that the men of Dunkirk had to go through by telling the fictional stories of three different groups and stirringly portrays their struggle to keep their courage and hope alive in the face of death.\n\nDunkirk creates it's tense and desperate setting by a relentless mix of pace, music and encompassing cinematography. Hans Zimmer provides a score that is jarring in many respects. As he did in Interstellar, Zimmer departs from the tropes common to the scores of the genre and definitely does not create a score that invokes the period. He instead provides a musical wall of low foreboding synthesized textures that conveys the feelings of desperation and fear in the soldiers with raw upfrontness. Also like Interstellar, the sheer weight and power of the score and the way Nolan often pushes it to the forefront might be a cause for a headache or simply feeling overwhelmed but this is definitely not because the music or score itself is bad but because it is doing precisely what it is meant to do. The job of the score is not always a pleasant one and while it is true that blending the music seamlessly with the background is usually the best way to convey the subliminal message music sends, sometimes to convey the intensity and overwhelming nature of the film one is watching, a score equally as intense and in your face is required. The gorgeous cinematography in the film also conveys the spirit of intensity while maintaining impressive visual quality. Filmed almost entirely on Imax cameras and without a single frame composed entirely digitally, the film team had their work cut out for them on this film but under the masterful leadership (and often camera handling) of cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, a sense of epic scale is achieved alongside the tensity of the action. The camera never cheats in this film because it never has anything to hide. So much was built practically and shot in camera that the action could be displayed as it is without having to cover things up with visual tricks. The feel of the camerawork places the audience in the story in a very immersive way while still maintaining a tight sense of dread. Shot in natural lighting and sometimes in very tight and constricting spaces, the cinematography is sometimes breathtaking, always wide in scope and captures tension in a unique and bold way. Another element that sets Dunkirk apart from a common war film is it's lack of dialogue and short runtime. Nolan expressed that from the very beginning of the film he wanted it to have a third act feel. To place the audience in the situation with the characters with no lead up or back story other than a few words of text on the screen and a leaflet falling from the sky. Dunkirk succeeds in it's gutsy attempt to create a film that is \"all third act\" with it's carefully crafted narrative acting as a strong skeleton for the rush of non-stop terror, action, movement and emotion that it pours out. With innovative tactics of yesteryear blended with distinctly original and modern storytelling and style, Dunkirk creates a visceral experience of a historic event that is to be revered and remembered as its subject matter should be.\n\nThe miracle of Dunkirk is an example of the human spirit to not lose hope in the face of death. Dunkirk was ultimately a defeat and yet at the same time a victory. This paradox is what makes the event so fascinating and makes the film so worthy of scrutiny. There is more to the hope in the soldiers and civilians of Dunkirk then just a belief that they will survive; there is also a more realistic hope, a more courageous hope that even if they face danger or death that they will be able to do some good with the situation. The people of England never thought to give up in the face of their defeat but put all of their efforts into an seemingly impossible task of enlisting hundreds of civilian ships to evacuate 300,000 men. Because of their stubborn hope they won a victory in the midst of their defeat. One may look at the situation as a whole and say that England simply eluded being annihilated and that no military advantage was gained in the event, for the people and the spirit of England, having their boys home safe was good enough and the film definitely portrays that side of the story. It doesn't pretend like Dunkirk was not a devastating loss, one of the final shots is of the pilot Farrier being taken prisoner by the Germans, but it does recognize and convey the spirit of Dunkirk and convey that spirit of unquenchable hope that was so important to the people of the time and is important for us who remember. However, the question in war is rarely \"what can I do?\" but \"how can I do it?\". In other words, the opportunity to do good and to be brave abounds but day to day choices become much more difficult. Risks still exist and every choice may cost you, another, or both of you your lives. In the film, in all three storylines, the main characters take every situation and try to do the most honorable thing they can. It doesn't always work out for the better for them, but others are affected and no deed goes without an outcome. In times of war, sticking to a true north may be the only way to keep one's head level and make the right choices, in the film, the characters stick to a code of honor that keeps them grounded while the horror of war swells around them. Another weighty topic the film addresses that the context of the story suggests is the value of lives over the strategic blow of a defeat. To clarify, I realize that escape was the only option at Dunkirk and that defeat was inevitable but at the end there is not a sense of defeat even though many British vehicles, supplies and lives were lost. The simple fact is that the leaders in England understood the real thing that needed saving and put all of its effort into making the best of a bad situation and in so doing made a bad situation good. The events of Dunkirk, and the film especially pose a dangerous battle between hope and desperation. Only by keeping hope alive was that good achieved. Near the beginning of the film the main character Tommy sits on the beach and observes a soldier that has given into despair and walks into the sea, drowning himself. The battle between hope and despair is so dire in wartime and especially in the situation of Dunkirk because despair is self destructive and speeds you on your way to death, while hope is a driving force to keep going through that fear into life. There can be no middle ground. Even with minimal character development, dialogue or time to reflect, Dunkirk still delivers much to be thought about afterwards and a lot of deep meaning to be unpacked.\n\nOne of the more brilliant aspects of this film is the way it deals with character. With barely time to remember their faces and not enough dialogue to remember their names, some may find it hard to empathise with their stories. However, this approach is entirely intentional and is not a product of lazy or poor writing. By giving the audience no background and minimal introduction to the numerous characters in the three storylines, I believe Nolan is doing two things, by not devoting any time to the introduction of his characters he is trying to make the possibility of their deaths much more believable. It is an almost universal understanding that if the main character dies he or she will die at the end. Anything before that doesn't hold any weight or stakes because the film is about them and usually has devoted so much time to their introduction and characterization. In Dunkirk, each man is simply another soldier among the thousands who may get lucky once, but might not get lucky again. The other thing that points to the intentionality of the overall \"facelessness\" of the main characters is that the reality is that Dunkirk is the story of thousands and thousands of individuals and to limit the narrative to focusing intently on a few would be to narrow the subject. Nolan portrays each place where Dunkirk was lived out, on the sea, in the air and on the beaches but by keeping his characters fictional and vague he is evoking the universality of the event and almost making it allegorical. Each character is almost meant to represent the entirety of their group and the experiences and feelings that each group had. Using this tactic, Nolan is attempting to not water down the events, but put them into an even more poignant spearhead. In this allegorical way each main character gives an example of the spirit of the film. George, Peter and Mr. Dawson all push faithfully on toward Dunkirk, saving two soldiers on the way and press on even when it seems pointless to do so. Tommy defends the life of the French Gibson when he is threatened to leave the rapidly sinking boat that hides them from the enemy. Even though he lied about his identity and even though Tommy knows that someone must leave the boat or they will all die, Tommy insists, risking his own life in the conflict. Farrier chooses to turn around and defend a ship full of fugitives even when his fuel is critically low and he ultimately gets captured on the beach but saves many lives because of his decision. Even Colonel Bolton makes a sacrifice of courage when he opts to stay on the beach and risks his life to oversee evacuating the French troops after the bulk of British forces had been evacuated. Each character represents the courage and spirit of the men at Dunkirk in a way that we might not remember their character specifically, but we will remember what they have done. \n\nDunkirk is a riveting and relentless experience that is not only a testament to good filmmaking, but also a testament to a historic event that should never be forgotten. Nolans standards for filming as much as possible for real and his technically challenging script pushed the filmmakers to their limits in editing, sound design, production design, music, the whole works. The film puts thought provoking messages and themes into its narrative while still maintaining a fast pace and all the stylings of a thriller. Choosing more archetypal characters rather than his usual flawed central characters, Nolan quite intentionally disconnects the narrative from any specific person to create a more comprehensive account of the massive event that was Dunkirk. The film captures the spirit of what Dunkirk was with surprising clarity. The final scene speaks especially poignantly as Tommy reads Winston Churchill's address to the English people after their troops had been returned safely home. Churchill's famous speech where he promises \"we will fight them on the beaches\" holds an all new meaning as a message of hope and resolve plays over the aftermath of each storyline. In the midst of pain and tragedy, fear and terror, loss and pain, Dunkirk emerged as a beacon of hope for the war to come. As this film reminds us of that, it also stands as a beacon of great filmmaking, the innovation, massive amount of organization in its making mirror its subject matter and deliver a moving and awe inspiring experience.",

            "content": "MINOR SPOILER ALERT\n\nDunkirk is an exceptional film that deserves all the praise that it's received! It may be one of my favorite war films that I've seen, but to be frank, I haven't seen that many war movies, and I know that in this film is especially tame in terms of gore, but I kind of liked that because it forced you to focus more on everything that was happening and being felt by the soldiers, scared of death and full of suspense and awkward silence. The film really excelled in many different areas. I'll first comment on the acting, which was probably the most underrated element of this film. One must remember that these actors were given very little to work with, but they were able to communicate so much through body language and facial expressions. The jealousy of being unable to get on the boat, the need to remain calm under extreme pressure, the feelings of traumatic stress, etc., were all expressed very convincingly and only through a few lines of dialogue and everchanging faces. While it's definitely not the best acting ever, I do think it's worth mentioning because of how little the actors were given in the first place. Cinematography and editing were just beautiful, definitely the best parts of the film. I was surprised to find out that it did not win Best Cinematography at the Academy Awards, but I haven't seen Blade Runner 2049 so, what do I know? All I can say is that the scenes shot in the air and on the water were some of the most beautiful scenes I've seen yet (though I am saying this as someone relatively new to cinema). One scene in particular, where the one fighter's plane just glides along the beach of Dunkirk, and we see Dunkirk's landscape as the plane gently falls, seemed so realistic and breathtaking I thought I was in the plane myself! Needless to say, I was extremely impressed. In terms of direction and screenplay, I thought that Nolan did a great job. I liked his unique take with the film, and I thought that the absence of dialogue had Nolan's intended affect, which was to ultimately incite the same sense of fear and silent hope that the soldiers had experienced in the viewers. Nolan's direction is unconventional in that this is supposed to be an action-war type film, but what makes it work is the fact that it does have a decent amount of action and suspenseful scenes, yet everything has much more solemnity so the film is more grounded and realistic. There were very few things that I disliked about this film; the theme of nationalism sort of annoyed me because that's kind of why they were in the war in the first place, and at times the film could be a tad bit boring, though not as much as I expected it to be. Ultimately the reason why I decided not to give this film the full five stars is because it honestly didn't completely amaze me and it's definitely not something I'd casually watch again, but still, I'd recommend it to friends.",

More like an experience of true horrors of war showing that war is not about some brave personalities with weapons. It's about nameless and faceless soldiers facing an existential crisis, the possibility of randomized death, and how they can either respond with despair or hope. Hans Zimmer's terrific use of sound also puts you right there in the middle of the war and some of the sound effects were so real that you couldn't help but feel as if you were right there which provides you an intense experience of death. Christopher Nolan shows again why he's an important phenomenon in films today. His work is experiential, his screenplay is more action than words. The class this man brought to movies is unmatched by any other filmmaker in recent times.",

Also the cast is just great. Like dude, you were able to put Harry Styles into the movie and make it work. That's not suppose to happen!!! Also the big name stars do their job well as well. But there's one problem to this near flawless film, which is the characters. The actors playing these people are great, but the characters really aren't. Like they're not bad per se, just….forgettable. I literally watched this movie a hour ago and I don't remember any of the characters names, except for Georges, the only reason being that he dies in a weird way. Sure, you can have a great story, but none of it is going to matter if you don't have memorable characters, which Dunkirk doesn't have. Besides that, it was nominated for best picture for a reason. If you can deal with a movie with very little in the character department (like myself), then this has to be on the top of your list.",

The mains characters are Tommy(played by Fionn Whitehead) Peter(Tom Glynn-Carney) and Colonel Winnant(James D'Arcy). The movie takes place in Dunkirk during the Second World War. It tells the story of the evacuation of British and French troops under enemy's fire. This evacuation was a success with the help of civilians boats. The plot is a little bit difficult to understand because their is no explanations during the movie. Why have to guess were the movie take place, when. But this make the movie very unpredictable. After that, I would say that the movie is very absorbing. It's easy when you watch the movie to identified yourself to the characters because there is a lot of different personalities. The visual effects are very outstanding and make the movie even more realistic. This movie cost 150 M $ so it's an high budget movie. Photography is impressive. There is a lot of different filming technics used in the movie. The acting was very natural and realistic. Actors are really thinking like real terrified soldier doing everything do save there lives. The script is very realistic with a little part of inexplicable. It is also moving and spectacular. It's a real blockbuster. To conclude, I found this movie very realistic and absorbing.

The movie won Oscars for sound and film editing as well as sound mixing. The story was told from three view points all intertwined in one story. I just hated when they went from present to past to when the soldiers make it back to their hometown. The few lines in the script did not truly tell anything about the story, there was more action and less storyline to follow. The cast included Tom Hardy as a fighter pilot, Kenneth Branagh as the Commander, Cillian Murphy and Harry Styles. Overall it was a good movie with no plot that I can't see watching again.",

This movie is based around the event that happened at Dunkirk, and doesn't involve itself too much with the people in the event, which makes me care less for them.

Conventional wisdom would suggest that revisiting it on my laptop would diminish it; and while it's true that the experience invokes less awe and wonder, the changed context reveals other strengths. Chief among these is a surprising intimacy which springs from the choice to mainly focus on a handful of characters; the relentless tension remains, but now we're drawn into the frightening, remarkable fellowship of people with names and faces living through previously unimaginable trauma, allowing me to emerge with a kind of thankfulness to individuals as opposed to nameless masses. \n\nThe smaller screen also allows the emotion to sink in - something people often (misguidedly, in my view) say is missing from Nolan's films. We are drawn into these men's experiences of war; and whilst intense, violent trauma leaves little room for the outward expression of feelings, emotion is unmistakably there in the deaths and other losses, the relief on Kenneth Branagh's face as he gazes at the horizon to try to work out what he's seeing. - and at many other times. It also suggests to me the film may be touching on something around masculinity - or at least, the sort of masculinity war and its associated trauma forces men into; to push feelings down in order to survive. The implication, perhaps, that our models of masculinity are still in the shadow of two global conflicts and many other more localised ones; has the societal cost of what conflict does to combatants (so often men) and all affected by it truly been counted in how we expect men to be, and the implications of that for all manner of relationships? A question to think on.\n\nTechnically there remains so much to admire - the remarkable score, the sound-design and cinematography amongst them. I was also struck in a way I wasn't in the cinema by how often there is little in the way of sound emerging from the events on-screen - some shuffling boots of otherwise silent men, the ricochet of a bullet, the waves. This allows the sounds of conflict to have more power when they do arrive - and also enhances the intimacy; truly a triumph of sound-design. \n\nI was rewatching this with my cinema trip to see Tenet still quite fresh in my memory, and Dunkirk's tight structure, discipline and the relentless pace do show up Tenet's weaknesses. Dunkirk remains a triumph, however - telling the same story as the inferior Darkest Hour did, from a different perspective and without the same crass national myth-making that film indulged in. Of course, elements of the myths Britain continues to tell itself about Dunkirk and this war, in general, are still here in Nolan's film, but it does with more emotional honesty and resonance than The Darkest Hour ever comes close to achieving.",

            "content": "Tecnicamente impecável, mas o que é além disso?\n\nEssa obra me causou uma pequena confusão mental. Por um lado, eu estava impressionado. A fotografia do filme é um tão impactante quanto um diamante refletido. A técnica de alternar as proporções funciona muito bem aqui, mesmo que seja mais aparente na Smart TV. A trilha sonora se encontra muito presente, o que pra mim é um ponto positivo. O cenário é absolutamente lindo, seja em alto mar, na terra ou no ar. O elenco tá bem definido, mesmo que o mesmo não tenha um peso muito grande aqui. Enfim, assistir essa obra em 4k HDR é uma experiencia unica.\n\nO roteiro do filme está em outro nível. A compreensão de Nolan quanto a técnica narrativa vai além do esperado, e aqui, mais uma vez, ele prova isso e brinca com a linha do tempo para nos entregar uma experiencia mais impactante. O clímax, onde as três storylines se encontram é muito bem feita e conduzida. Porém, nem tudo são flores.\n\nApesar da minha agradável concepção aos aspectos técnicos, o filme não parece ter uma alma. Meu envolvimento emocional foi zero. O desenvolvimento dos personagens acontece, mas simplesmente não é o suficiente para criar uma ligação entre os mesmos e o publico. A trilha sonora passa a sensação de que mil e uma coisas estão acontecendo, ou que há algo grandioso para acontecer,  o problema é que essa tensão soa forçada, pois nada a altura da OST acontece, e você fica se perguntando \"porque???\"\n\nO cenário, apesar de lindo, não aparenta ser de um filme de guerra. Os soldados não parecem cansados, e toda aquela situação não aprece tão ruim quanto o filme tenta nos enfiar \"goela abaixo\". Para uma total imersão, decidi rever o filme no fone de ouvido, sem legendas e com o áudio original. Porem eu não contava com uma trilha sonora tão alta. Na maioria das vezes, principalmente se tratando de compositores talentosos como Hans Zimmer, isso não me chateia, mas aqui todos os personagens fazem um esforço ENORME pra... sussurrar. Não sou fluente na língua inglesa, porém a dificuldade que tive pra entender as falas foi fora do normal. O filme já conta com poucas linhas de dialogo, e quando há, eu não as entendo.\n\nNo final das contas, assisti o filme mais uma vez, priorizando o máximo a imersão e qualidade  do mesmo, mas ainda assim não fui capaz de dizer o que essa historia veio para contar.\n\nEdit: Depois de me esforçar muito, consegui entender o porque muitas pessoas amaram o filme. A atmosfera criada pelo Nolan é, talvez, inovadora. O vazio, a falta proposital de emoção, expressividade ou até personalidade provam o ponto niilista do filme. Eu fiquei um pouco confuso, pois a OST tecla muito no drama, que ao meu ver, não existe sem pre-requisitos. Porém, eu consigo sim compreender o porque esse filme é autentico em alguns aspectos, e isso merece sim seu reconhecimento - mesmo eu não tendo entrado no filme.\n\nÁudio: English, no subtitles [6°]\nQuality: 4K HDR",

            "content": "This film distinguishes itself from other war films in a very interesting way. I do not think we can really call it a war film. This film is not so much about the war, but mainly focuses on the soldiers who are just trying to survive. Every soldier for himself, because that is what it comes down to. The film does not depict, like most films, a fairly long time span, but rather a short moment. It also shows that all soldiers are living at the moment themselves. No one can control who dies or who is spared. There is no difference between rich and poor, smart and stupid. Every soldier is equal. The director reflects this by not focusing on the background stories of the soldiers, sometimes we don't even know the names of the characters. Anyone can die at any moment because of the unknown enemy. Christopher Nolan reflects this nicely by never showing the enemy. We only see the Germans at the last moment and there we only see a shadow. The interesting thing about the film is that we see the story from different perspectives: An ordinary soldier, a fighter pilot, a naval officer who arranges the crossing and even a family who is going to rescue stranded soldiers. The minimal use of special effects gives the film a very real feeling.",

Instead, you know where they are and what they're going through, and you don't need to know anything else. Nolan is one of the best directors today for good reason, and the visuals in this movie are some of the best he's delivered. And his writing, as usual, is also incredible. It is less dialogue heavy than some of his other works and tells this story visually through a majority of it, and makes it work perfectly. There are three timelines being displayed at once which was a bit disorienting at first, but once you get how the story is playing out, it really makes the movie even better. The performances are wonderful, and very very real. I don't think any other war movie really puts you in the moment like this one. It's another masterpiece from a legendary filmmaker.",

There isn't much character development that can turn people away but I think it works as the story does on focusing on the technical side of filmmaking and Nolan says the story is like trying to remember something from a long time ago not knowing where it starts which I like. This is another amazing non-linear story that Nolan keeps pumping out and it is kinda like Tarantino with the chapters in this movie. This is a technical achievement and I hope that Tenet defies our expectations like every one of his films have been doing. Nolan cast Harry Styles and he does an amazing job of course, not oscar worthy but he does an amazing, better than some established actors working now. This movie really has an amazing cast from Cillian Murphy to Tom Hardy. I love when Nolan storylines fall in place it just has a sense of accomplishment to it. This is one of the shortest scripts I think it is like 77 pages which is impressive because the normal amount of pages is around 120 it is impressive they created a good story from that and I respect him for that. This movie has a certain energy with it it's like a Shepard Tone that just keeps rising and rising without stopping it is like the equivalent to this movie with each storyline that just keeps rising and rising and adding crosscutting and the score to it, it just creates some of the best tension and suspense in any movie.\n\nThis story keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time and it keeps you so engaged mainly because of the amazing suspense created. Some people may have a problem with the characters not being compelling and no character development but I think they are plenty compelling because they are in war and could be killed any second. This movie has a certain atmosphere to it be it the uniforms the score and the locations they used it feels like we are there with them. The cinematography in this movie is amazing from the color pallet used and to the shot selection. This movie easily has my favorite sound editing and sound mixing in any movie and in my opinion it is the best in all of film it is just amazing and the score is easily one of my all time favorites with my favorite being Interstellar's score. Nolan impresses me on every film of his and he has a gift to make a blockbuster an oscar winning film and I don't think anyone else in the business can do that except for him. The editing I loved and it may be favorite work of editing put to film and it really shows the emotion of everyone in the movie it truly is amazing. The script and dialogue are very short but they are very good better than some other scripts that are longer. The acting from everyone is amazing and Harry Styles is the standout of anyone. This movie truly is a masterpiece and one of the best films in my opinion. Overall I absolutely loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone.\n💯%",

            "content": "While Dunkirk is different from every other Christopher Nolan film, it also somehow manages to include many Christopher Nolan tropes that make his films special. although the film includes the same usual cast (minus Michael Caine), and includes a similar visual style, the structure and story of Dunkirk is what sets it apart. In some ways, this is good for Nolan, however, in a few more ways, it doesn't. As a start, it is important to point out a flaw with the characters in this film. It suffers the exact same problem that I faced with the Dark Knight Rises, Nolan can't seem to be able to pick one protagonist. This could have worked if it was done in a similar way as Pulp Fiction, telling multiple short stories that are non-linear, but all build into one storyline. On the other hand, Nolan decided to do a similar method, but to do it linearly. This makes it so we, as the audience, don't spend much time on one single character at one time. Although each scenario is different, both visually and structurally, it would have been nice to learn more about each of these characters, and why everything in the movie is so important. Everything just seems incredibly thrown together, and the timeline just doesn't quite fit. There are certain things that feel real in terms of time, for example, following the small British boat throughout the movie made the journey feel long, drawn out. However, there are other cases in which the timeline doesn't work at all, especially all of the soldiers on the beach. Every scene on the beach seems to just be more or less the same thing. There was a lot of room to build upon the importance of each troop on the beach, but the film mostly threw that away to value the overall entertainment more. Which, on that note, I should mention some of the good things about this movie, because it isn't all bad. As I said, the movie is a very engaging and entertaining watch. Although the timeline doesn't feel right, the way it is told keeps the tension of the film rising every second. This is accompanied by Hans Zimmer's brilliant score, using an auditory illusion to constantly build. The way the film looks is also a brilliant take, a usual Nolan staple. So, while there are things in Dunkirk I would prefer a different way, the entertainment value, visual style, and decent performances by the cast make it at the very least worth watching.",

But, the men will reach the ship in time. You are supposed to be amazed. If you find this kind of scene amazing, maybe you will like this movie. If, instead, you see the start of the scene and go \"ffs, not this tired old trope again\" it may not be for you.\nFundamentally this film is a series of events that like the beach running scene make absolutely no sense.\nA battle rages on a street while a few 100 metres away soldiers lounge on a beach seemingly oblivious. A fisherman is able to instantly calculate the buoyancy of his bullet holed boat to within the weight of one man. A destroyer has a room inside it seemingly larger than the destroyer. I could go on.\nAt the time of watching, what I mostly thought about was how incredibly boring and long the movie was. It was a real effort to stay in the theatre to the finish.\nThe movie is vastly disconnected from reality.\nIs the director satirising Hollywood movie conventions?\nIs this meant to be some kind of nonsensical dream land reflecting the insanity of war?\nOr is his perception of reality so utterly limited that he doesn't see how silly it is?\nI don't know, but for me the resulting movie was hugely over-hyped and utterly boring.",

Murphy pulls off an extremely convincing victim of shellshock and very possibly PTSD as a soldier who is marooned on the lifeless skeleton of his former ship.

This movie differs in Nolan's usual style of long, dialogue heavy movies, where it's only 106 minutes and the characters hardly talk.

I feel like half of the time the only sounds were that of explosions and it made the movie extremely heavy. In a way that definitely helped to keep the tone and establish a consistent mood but I just feel like there were times where it would go into a bit of a lull and I would almost fall asleep because no one was doing or saying anything. Those times could've been filled in with a little bit of back story on something the characters went through to provide us with just the slightest bit of context and keep us invested in the movie throughout. Other than that I have no complaints. Acting was amazing, definitely was surprised by the addition of Harry Styles, but not disappointed in the slightest.",

The acting was all fine but there weren't any extraordinary performances and Harry Styles was given a few too many lines. The plot was acceptable, the characters were fine, but this film was more artwork than story. There was a bit of action, but the combat took place in the air and it's a shame that the enemy is never shown in the flesh. Not my favourite of Nolan's films but worth a watch. It was more enjoyable the second time and watching it immediately after Darkest Hour gave it some extra context. It was an enjoyable experience but the odd plot, some poor visual effects, and constant switching between characters is what lets it down in my book.",

Time is also toyed with allowing the viewer having to piece together the chronologically the events but again this is done for pacing. Huge chunks of this film was filmed in IMAX and the setting plays very well in the format with wide expansive shots of boats and beaches used to great effect.

            "content": "War films are not a genre that I particularly like as while I can appreciate the fact that Apocalypse Now (1979) and The Deer Hunter (1978) are masterpieces they offer a lot more than the average war epic and that is exactly what this film is. The technical elements of the film could not be faulted as Nolan has always been excellent at bringing together professionals capable of bringing stunning visuals to the screen together but story wise the film is less engaging and while I appreciate the film's relatively short running time it's hard not to feel that it's rather slight. For fans of The Longest Day (1962) and Battleground (1949) this will satisfy their hunger for a patriotic, straightforward war film with violence and thrills but for people who want more character development and dialogue in their entertainment this can feel rather dull.\n\nIn 1940, the Allies have had to retreat to Dunkirk and their soldiers are surrounded by the Nazis who threaten to kill them all. Coming to save the soldiers are civilians who hope to carry the soldiers off the beach on their private boats that would usually be employed to take part in leisure activities. The soldiers are embodied in the form of various fictional characters as one faces PTSD and takes a violent action with dire consequences while another desperately tries to survive with the aid of another mysterious soldier who may or may not be French. Well meaning civilians carrying soldiers back to Britain are also embodied as we see two innocent young men come of age through their experiences on the boat while the strong, sensible father of one of them reveals his sad backstory. Other subplots concern a pilot in the sky quickly running out of fuel and a noble Commander making difficult decisions under pressure.\n\nThe aerial sequences in the film are impressive as we feel as though we are seeing everything from the perspective of the pilot, only known as Farrier, in addition to the battles being understandable and easy to follow while still exciting. This is true for most of the film as we do feel suspense and tension when two young soldiers are forced to hide from their superiors in an attempt to jump on a boat earlier than other polite British soldiers queuing up on the beach. For me this wasn't enough to carry the film as while it is all well and good to be dazzled by special effects I want there to be some substance or commentary beneath the films I am watching.\n\nThis film tries to delve into making a real statement on modern times with vague Brexit analogies as the British soldiers bar French soldiers from entering their boats even as a French soldier helps them to survive. Unfortunately they lay this on so thick that it is hard to find any room to interpret the message as it is shoved down your throat. One of the most painful lines in the film is also produced by this theme as a character played by Harry Styles, of all boy band members turned actors, tells his fellow soldiers that a suspect fellow onboard their ship probably has \"An accent thicker than sauerkraut sauce.\" It is difficult to swallow lines this clunky especially when they come out of the mouth of the least convincing actor in the film. This is no Paths of Glory (1957) for all it's ambition of being that film for this generation but at least it doesn't have the insidious pro-violence message of Saving Private Ryan (1998).\n\nI have to admit that I probably won't remember this film very well as it blends in with Gallipoli (1981) and Hacksaw Ridge (2016) as a war film that is good but not great. I do have to admire the craft of Nolan even as I am not quite as enamored of his film as some are as his Best Director nomination is admittedly deserved and he does keep a handle on what could have been an unruly and over the top production. This wasn't one of my top ten films of 2017 but for some it will have been and I can still admire it's execution without considering it a great piece of art.",

Revisiting the dreadful history. That we started, ended, celebrated and mourned for. It cannot just be a \"quick\" recall. And it shouldn't be that. I may not know the real pulp behind all this passion and necessity but Christopher Nolan, the writer and director, surely tells you, it shouldn't just be a recall. Quick one, surely compared to his other films, but more than an experience and a moral lesson. Poem, it sings and poetic is its run. To me the film felt like a marathon. A sprint, to be precise. \"The mole\" tries to run away from the enemy, the air support towards the enemy but the real heroes, the common man, are kept in hault.\n\nMid way. They are stretched and strained from the responsibilities of both the kind, the personal and towards the nation. And that is exactly how Nolan pitches this incredibly noble deed by these brave hearts in one lap. Setting the parameters, he never breaks any boundaries for obvious reasons, but hovers very close to the red zone marked in this film. And that is another way how he elevates a most simplistic act or a decision that lives up to the clean soundtrack of Hans Zimmer.\n\nThe same year, Steven Spielberg's The Post released which dealt with the similar highly tensed close up shots. But the tension never communicates for no one actually points out or marginalizes the \"normal\" behavior. And in here, Nolan keeps Cilian Murphy to strike fear, a simple meter to explain the stakes of Tom Hardy and a know-it-all Harry Styles to guide Fionn Whitehead. Dunkirk is still at the end of the day comes under the catalogue of Nolan's filmography. He cannot help but whisper secrets if he can in a storyline, I mean he even packs a humorous punch as a big reveal for that scene.",

Anyway, Nolan didn't go further into the soldier's personality and such, because it's (simply said) more about the war than the soldiers. A directional decision. However, Nolan managed to not support the 'fight-against-Germany-stereotype' by not mentioning nazi or hitler and by not putting them very vibrantly in the picture. Although, personally, I didn't quite enjoy this movie because of the missing plot and the fact that the characters are flat, almost anonymous. I didn't find the movie exciting. His intention to put the audience in such a position to be imagining that they are fighting in WWII worked pretty well, but (again, personally) in round character-movies i seem to imagine and feel own involvement much better.

You had the Creator from Ready Player One and still hardly a word. Whoever wrote this piece of s*** should be ashamed.

Christopher Nolan and his whole entire team did nothing but an absolutely amazing job on Dunkirk. It was impressive and it was powerful.\n\nI haven't watched many \"war movies\", mainly because I usually don't really enjoy them. But this one is worth the watch. It's not only amazing cinematography, directing and acting, this movie is a whole experience on its own. I don't think I've ever felt more a part of a movie as I did with Dunkirk. (I watched it in IMAX so there's a lot of screen. It might have something to do with that, but still.) The camera work was exquisite, it brought drama as well as stability when there needed to be. Hans Zimmer has truly outdone himself. My pumping heart was mainly because of his amazing music. Don't get me started on the actors. Showing us all that you don't need a script filled with many lines to make a brilliant movie or to show how good an actor can act. Heck, I think if you can play a movie like this one, you for sure are a great actor. I know people are giving Harry Styles a lot of praise for this movie (seeing that it's his first proper role) and I with them, he was amazing. But I don't want to forget about all the other actors. Fionn Whitehead, Jack Lowden, Cillian Murphy, Kenneth Branagh all artists in what they do, no doubt. Mark Rylance was a rock in the ocean for everyone, giving us all hope and showing that not all people are as bad. His character was a beautiful person. Aneurin Barnard and Tom Glynn-Carney really stood out for me as well. They were both strong individuals with their own minds who did what they could for survival, not only for themselves but for the people around them as well. Before I stop my (once again) too long actor praise I just want to say: Tom Hardy. What a legend.\n\nI'd like to end this review with the same words I started it. This movie is a piece of art, something you truly experience and not just watch, something you're a part of. I really, really recommend you to go watch it. It will be worth your while.",

            "content": "WOW. Just....wow. I was abso-fricking-lutely BLOWN AWAY by this movie. Why is it different from so many other war movies out there? Good question:\nFirstly, it's the way this movie was handled. The new trend for war movies these days is a lot of blah-blah between politicians, less pow-pow between soldiers. This movie ERADICATED politicians, and showed us the conditions of the soldiers non-stop. Seriously, there wasn't one quick-cut scene of Winston Churchill giving inspiring speeches. It was non-stop tension and action, because, you, the spectator, couldn't leave the beach, just like the soldiers, so you're desperately rooting for them the whole way through. This movie has so much suspense. Whether it's soldiers on the sea, air or ground, there's always something going on, and it leaves you completely breathless.\nSecondly, it was the atmosphere. Atmospheres are something of a speciality for Christopher Nolan, and I think he nails it again in this movie. Dark, brooding, menacing. All elements to add in this gritty tale of bloodshed and desperation.\nThird, the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer is back, and his soundtrack in this movie literally makes me nervous. He even adds these tick-tock sounds in his music to force more pressure into the emotion of the music. Beautiful.\nAnd last, the action. The action in this movie was terrific. It was so real, and I literally flinched every time a gun was fired. The sound effects were so REAL! The dogfights (that's plane war) were phenomenal, the crisis on land and on the sea is sensational, and it all, once again, reinforces this idea of true grit and distress. \nLook, DUNKIRK is one of THE BEST war movies I've seen in a long time, and I really enjoyed it. If you're in for nail-biting suspense, heart-thudding action and superb acting in a war movie, take DUNKIRK. Trust me, you're in for a treat!",

There were parts of the movie where I felt that I was actually part of the battle except I was the observer. For a fortunate generation like ours who have never had to witness war directly nor indirectly- this was as close I would hopefully ever get. It was thrilling in parts but also frightening. Nolan does not waste time spoon-feeding the audience with emotional innuendoes, he fills the plot with many sub-plots and allows the audience to connect with the emotion that moves them most, and there was plenty- patriotism, PTSD, friendships, lots and lots of camaraderie, an abject sense of longing for home, fear, survival. These were all cast as islands all drifting together to form an compact archipelago of a solid plot. The background score like all his previous movies did not disappoint, he is one of the few directors around that uses the sense of hearing to the fullest thereby ensuring an audio and visual treat, the ever rising crescendos and then the sudden silence mimicked the peaks and valleys of hope and utter despair that the soldiers felt. To me personally the music was the most striking.\nNot only did the script, casting and the screenplay go exactly per Nolan's plan but as any great director would do he also demanded and orchestrated everything that the audience felt. When the movie ended, spontaneously the entire crowd stood up and clapped. I walked out drained from the experience!!!",

The main reason for this is that I am somewhat reluctant watching a movie where the story is pretty well known before you sit down to watch it. However a few days ago I finally did and, given all the hype, I have to say that I expected more, a lot more.\n\nSure the movie is a cinematically very well down movie. Acting, camera and all that is excellent. Unfortunately that is all there is.\n\nFirst of all, where the hell did the over-inflated budget go? Dunkirk was a major undertaking with almost 400 000 soldiers involved and hundreds and hundreds of boats. We get to see what? A few columns of soldiers, a handful of boats and three pitiful spitfires against a bomber and two Fock Wulfes. To add to this insult we pretty much get to see the same bloody event over and over from different angles. This is an insult to all the brave men that made this rescue possible.\n\nThere are a few likable people in the movie. Like the Navy commander and the elderly guy on the pleasure boat steaming to rescue. The rest are either psychotic or morons.\n\nRealism? Not so much. Like the scene where a bunch of soldiers are trapped in a boat being shot to pieces. Would any one in their right mind really have thought they could plug dozens and dozens of holes with their hands and then sail across the channel?\n\nThen we have the spitfire which runs out of fuel and glides around forever over the beach so the director can get some scenic shots done. Other times fairly large boats gets damaged and flips over in seconds.\n\nI would also have expected some pre-story. Some build up. But no, the story starts right away with these measly handful of boats and planes taking for bloody ever to drag themselves over to where they are supposed to go.\n\nQuite a disappointment indeed.",

            "content": "War Never Changes\nA movie review of the movie Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan\nTired of the latest Marvel movies? Looking for something more realistic and historically accurate? Look no further than Dunkirk. The movie Dunkirk is based on the real event when the Naziï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s surrounded British soldiers on the beach of Dunkirk in France. The movie follows three storylines at once which all last different lengths. Although some characters are real people and some arenï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t, this film was based entirely off of real accounts of the siege. This movie combines a cinematic trick that works out well with the telling of the story. The movie also keeps you on the edge of your seat with a lack of dialogue, which is a sin but also praise.\n\nThe film Dunkirk uses multiple storylines, not an uncommon idea, and was executed well during the shooting of the movie. The film followed three storylines, which all took place at different times. The story of the pilot lasted one hour, the story of the valiant sailors lasts one day, and the story of the soldier lasts one week. Why is this special? It provides foreshadowing and updates on the main characters for attentive viewers, making each story even more unique. For example, when the soldiers are swimming away from the burning boat, the pilot flies over and sees the carnage of the fight under him as he tries to protect the soldiers on the beaches. It shows what is happening and puts everything in perspective for the viewer, allowing a better timeline and a better viewing experience. Multiple storylines also makes up for the lack of dialogue and gives the viewer something to pay attention to.\n\nDunkirk has a lack of dialogue to emphasize the edge of your seat feeling it provides. It would not be considered as gory as Saving Private Ryan, but it is similar in quality and excellence as a war movie. The lack of dialogue emphasizes key moments in the movie, providing a gut-wrenching suspense. For example, when the soldiers were trapped in the beached boat and the Germans were shooting at it; the tide began to rise to the shore, and the boat was flooding, and the British soldiers were trying to plug the holes. The suspense and silence between each shot built to surprise and progressed the moment and forced them to leave the sinking ship in a daring escape. However, silence is not always the best. Some scenes in the movie struggled to progress due to a lack of dialogue. The movie had a large amount of standing around and dull moments that were only saved by the quicker story lines, particularly the valiant British boat story. However, that is the beauty of the splitting of stories, and for what the diverging story lacks, it makes up for in practicality.\n\nOverall, Dunkirk is confusing and people that I have talked to have had mixed feelings. However, those viewers who sat in the theater and paid attention thoroughly enjoyed it. Although boring at times, I would recommend Dunkirk to anyone looking for a war film on par with Saving Private Ryan. The lack of dialogue and the building stories make the movie unique and stand out among the crowd of the Marvel movies being shown today.\n\nRating: ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2...~ Stars\n\nWorks Cited - \nhttp://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/dunkirk/\n\n\n\n\n.",

It's not a subject that I'm interested in, but I'd heard such good things about Dunkirk that I thought I'd give it a shot.\n\nI'm not sure I watched the same film as those of you that give this meandering, lifeless garbage high praise.\n\nFirstly, the characters. And I use the word 'characters' in a very loose sense, since literal cardboard cutouts could have replaced the humans in this film and it wouldn't have made a difference. Nameless, emotionless, purposeless. A war film focusing on characters instead of action could have been incredible, but in order to do that you need to have meaningful and memorable characters.\n\nSecondly, the lack of any meaningful action whatsoever. I would assume there to be some kind of intense action in a movie about the second World War. What Dunkirk offers are shots fired from unseen enemies, bombs and shells dropped from off-screen to explode in a mundane fashion. I mean, how do you make explosions boring?\n\nThirdly, the realism. I don't like to see blood and gore in a war film, but it should be there. All of the shots and explosions are sanitized and offer no realistic effect. The Germans are carpet bombing the beach, and the dead soldiers lie there as if they're sleeping.\n\nAlso, the score was annoying. The clock ticking and nerve-wracking strings implied that the situation was intense and dramatic, rather than showing it to be so. Showing a bunch of people standing on a pier waiting to board a ship set against an intense soundtrack does not make the situation impactful.\n\nAlso, Tom Hardy flying around and occasionally shooting at things and literally having an infinite supply of fuel until the end of the film was a complete waste of his acting abilities. Hell, Nolan could have cast anyone for that role since Hardy spoke very little and had his face covered for almost the entire film.\n\nDunkirk looks good - really good - but that's about all it has going for it.",

            "content": "I just watched it and I didn't like it so much.\n\nThe beach which should've been packed with 400,000 men, women and children, was instead filled with 70 soldiers on a lovely clean beach. \nSoldiers were waiting in lines for boats, so far down the beach that the water was up to their necks. Here they're standing in an orderly fashion without a speck of dirt on their clothes.\nWhat should've been constant bombing and harassment by the luftwaffe consisted of 3 stukas and 1 bomber. Making 2-3 bombing runs on a nearly empty beach and one repeated bombing on a small military vessel. \nDogfights around Dunkirk with over 3000 sorties. 1 dogfight, 3 spitfires.\n39 destroyers and hundreds of civilian vessels boiled down to a couple of boats.\nYou get the idea, the scale isn't right and the movie doesn't manage to represent the sheer brutality of what occurred at Dunkirk as a consequence of this. \nBecause of this the thousands of men trying their very best to survive the living hell that was Dunkirk felt more like small bands of cowards running away from a little skirmish with the Germans. \n\n\nThe dogfights were cool, as inaccurate as they were (Where do these pilots store all of that ammunition they fire?).\nThe naval side of things didn't do so badly. While it didn't represent the number of ships present, it did show the fear and risk that ALL of the ships and boats present faced. U-boats, bombers, strafing runs and even gunfire from the ground. Dunkirk wasn't only fought on the beach. \nThe officers that we jumped to didn't really give us a good description of the perilous scenario unfolding. Their lines were so few and meaningless that it didn't bring much value to the movie. All they really did was tell us that nobody expected as many people to get out as they did as well as informing us why there weren't any more ships around.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the naval side, the acting was off for the civilians. Your brother/son dies and you don't care? Okay. \nYou've just stepped onto a warzone for the first time of your life, facing the dangers of becoming a target for the enemy aircraft. On the way here you'd probably seen ships full of demoralized troops fearful of the place that you're headed to. You get there to witness thousands of troops sitting on a beach with empty eyes and you begin letting on dozens of wounded and dying soldiers onto your boat. How do you act?\nWell all sunshine and roses of course. Smiles and cupcakes. We're here to save them after all! It's not like we're in a hurry or anything.\n\n\nTime wasn't represented very well on this movie either. Dunkirk lasted from 26 May to 4 June 1940.\nThis movie shows us a night scene or two, however the same scenes kept repeating themselves and we ended up going back in time more than a few times during this movie. As such, we don't get a real grasp on how long everything is taking. It's rather disorientating as you wonder how long they've been there for and when you come to that conclusion you realise that there's only been a handful of action scenes within that long period of time, so it once again contributes towards that \"Why are they running again?\" feeling. \nAfter the characters stories have finished we skip straight towards the end of the British evacuation and we show that there are all of a sudden no soldiers left. Again, confusing us as to the time frame we're in.\n\n\nThe desperation of Dunkirk was probably the only thing that I found to like in this movie. It definitely accurately represents the desperation of individual soldiers as well as the extremely low morale and mindset of these broken troops. On this front, the movie does extraordinarily well. Another worthy mention is the display of duty and responsibility the RAF pilots held for themselves, this movie places a lot of praises on the RAF and it does credit to their contribution.\n\n\nOverall I felt like this movie does not portray the terror or the devastating defeat that the evacuation of Dunkirk was and in that sense, this movie was a total disappointment. However the points that it did well in, it did a spectacular job at pulling off. \n4/10 for me. But I'd recommend watching it once, just for those few moments of pure brilliance.?",

            "content": "War films have been a staple on the art of cinema since its inception. Although brutal from human loss and devastation, those factors create an environment highly conducive to providing a crucible to explore the depths of the human condition running the gamut from jingoistic fervor to heartbreaking sacrifice. During World War II the movie studios provided entertainment that bolstered the morale of the public as the war waged on. The current world situation war is still prevalent but not in the concentrated form of the forties. War movies remain a powerful genre that can become a template for potential greatness. Among the latest directors to undertake this format is Christopher Nolan. Considered one of the most creative and well-respected filmmakers of his generation. From movies that reinvented the comic book genre, his Batman trilogy, to mind-bending experiences as 'Memento,' and 'Inception' he has redefined many aspects of the use of cinema as a means of artistic expression. As soon as the announcement was released that his next project would involve the Dunkirk evacuation of World War II, I was filled with anticipation. Once I received my review copy and was able to immerse myself in the film my expectations were exceeded greatly. Like many film buffs, I great up watching the great war films of the previous generation as they introduced us to the fantastically talented actors, directors, and screenwriters. Now the proverbial torch has been passed and in the vanguard, is Mr. Nolan. The actual military action known as Operation Dynamo was among the most inspiring feats of bravery found in armed conflict. The goal was not destruction of enemy forces but the supreme act of human kindness resulting in the evacuation of 338,226 from the beaches of France. It was hailed as a miracle and remains one of the most uplifting stories to come from the inhumane tragedy of global conflict.\n\nMr. Nolan has managed to return his movie to the golden age of Hollywood when the cast of extras numbered in the thousands and the credits rolling by featured a significant number of the most sought-after talent in the industry. Without glorifying the themes of war, this film is epic by all conceivable standards. The story follows the facts. With an event such as this, the historical account contains the pathos and emotional roller coaster worthy of such an epic endeavor. Of course, the usual caveat about the use of dramatic license remains in effect. Such alterations are typically required for factors like pacing, continuity and expediting exposition. Under the hand of a creative genius as Christopher Nolan, the result is staggeringly effective. In a stylistic decision that reinforces the filmmaking flair possessed by Mr. Nolan, he has divided this sweeping epic into three distinct yet interwoven threads, The Mole, The Water and The Air. Each covers a specific aspect of the mission highlighting different human reactions, drives, and experiences. An excellent use of variable pacing enhances the effectiveness of splitting the story with each thread presenting the events of a diminishing period from a week to a day to a single hour. The overall effect is purposely disorienting, emotionally suitable to reflect the events and assist the viewers to experience in some small way the general confusion intrinsically part of the war.\n\nMr. Nolan is undoubted of the influential filmmakers redefining the use of imagery in telling a story. He is capable of unworldly scenes expressing the sights far beyond the limitations of reality to a gritty depiction of life that draws the audience intimately into the narrative. This is substantiated by Nolan movies the fantasy brought to life in 'Inception' and the dark urban feel of a city in distress seen in the Dark Knight trilogy. For the first thread of this film, he brings the audience into city streets in the immediate aftermath of horrific violence. A group of soldiers is walking through a deserted street. The camera angles frame the men against buildings in such a fashion that a look of normalcy is infused with a sense of inherent danger lying beneath the surface. The hand of one man reaches through a window feeling for a cigarette while another man bends to take a drink from a hose. A sound that might be buzzing insects take on a dire nature as they change to the thud of bullets finding their targets. Another soldier glances at a map of the area highlighting the region.in an act that is fundamentally human and universally relatable the man unbuckles his pants and squats. Even in the midst of desolation, the most basic of biological needs must be attended. Thankfully most of us have ever endured combat and are unable to connect with the characters on that level. We all have that experience humanizing the character and allowing to understand him on an emotional level. There is little need for dialogue. This thread is intended to reach out to the audience viscerally reaching the most fundamental portion of our brains concerned with the most primitive needs.\n\nWe are next taken to a port where we are introduced to a father, Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) his son, Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney), and who are unloading a small pleasure craft. They are being helped by a teenager, George (Barry Keoghan), ostensibly to prepare the vessel which was conscripted into the evacuation mission. Instead of fulfilling those orders the three men set course on another course. It leads them to a flotilla of various civilian boats consisting anything that can float from work boats to tugs. Together the rag-tag fleet set off to cross the English Channel. Along the way, they encounter an officer who had been a ship sunk by the Germans. The man is suffering from what was then referred as 'shell shock' but now would be classified as PTSS. Upon realizing that his rescuers were headed along the coast rather than across the channel, he attempts to take the controls. During the confrontation, George receives a blow to the head rendering him blind.\n\nThe final thread considered brings the audience into the air, above the carnage that has enveloped the ground. Three British Spitfires are engaged in a dogfight with their German aerial counterparts. Weaving in and out of the cloud cover each plane desperately for a momentary edge to down their target. Although distinct in their specific slice of the narrative the different threads overlap and become entwined. During the aerial combat, the Spitfires can save a minesweeper but at a cost. One of the English planes is critically damaged forcing the pilot to ditch the doomed plane, in the water he is rescued by Dawson's boat.\n\nFor the most part, the characters remain unnamed. When a name is spoken it is incidental; there is little emphasis on the characters as individuals. Their backstories are irrelevant. The only true concerns are rank, mission and overriding the instinct to flee danger, charging in for the greater good. This was a huge effort on the part of the Allied forces, but Mr. Nolan brought the inconceivable, frantic horror down to terms that the audience can readily understand and better relate to personally. The primary focus of the film was a microcosm as seen from the perspective of individuals. One of the elements that propel this movie into the heights of great war film is the way Mr. Nolan was able to set the individuals against the larger backdrop of the war. Death and insanity surround each of the men in their specific segment, but one commonality remains attempting to condense their focus on what they must accomplish. The lines of demarcation between the three narrative threads are blurred by stylistic consideration such as switching between day and night, for the men involved in this massive rescue missions time is suspended, reduced to survive each moment in turn.\nbullet\tCreation: Revisiting the Miracle, Dunkerque, Expanding the Frame, The In-Camera Approach.\nbullet\tLand: Rebuilding the Mole, The Army On the Beach, Uniform Approach.\nbullet\tAir: Taking to the Air, Inside the Cockpit\nbullet\tSea: Assembling the Naval Fleet, Launching the Moonstone, Taking to the Sea, Sinking the Ships, The Little Ships\nbullet\tConclusion: Turning up the Tension, The Dunkirk Spirit",

The casting was superb. I was a bit astonished that teen heart throb, Harry Styles could deliver such a performance. With many great stars in the movie, each character was able to stand out. However, the crossing  narratives got a bit confusing. If you look away once, you'll be lost forever. Which isn't necessarily that bad. I do wish the introductions of each character was a lost smoother and cleaner. Each character was beautifully written and each performance was very well delivered. But, as the movie progresses you tend to lose who is who. However, if you paid close attention the movie was a roller coaster.

What semblance of characters we do get are so generic and the acting so flat that they do not evoke any emotional response. Now this issue could have been partly countered by truly bringing to life the event itself but the film fails on that front as well. Nolan never captures the scale of the invasion or any real feeling of impending doom the troops must have felt standing on that beach. Part of this may be explained through an almost complete lack of casualties in the film. Now I'm not saying every film has to have guts and entrails flying everywhere but it does need a something in the way of a visual representation of the horror of war to connect with the audience on a visceral level and I feel this movie was just to PG13 to accomplish that.

            "content": "The evacuation of allied soldiers from the British Empire, and France, were cut off and surrounded by the German army from the beaches and harbor of Dunkirk, France, between May 26- June 04, 1940, during Battle of France in World War II. \n\n\"Dunkirk\" portrays the evacuation from three perspectives: land, sea, and air. It has little dialogue, as Nolan sought instead to create suspense from cinematography and music. \"Dunkirk\" has extensive practical effects, and employed thousands of extras as well as historic boats from the evacuation, and period aeroplanes. \"Dunkirk\" received praise for its screenplay, direction, musical score, and cinematography. Some critics called it Nolan's best film to date and one of the greatest war films ever made. Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads: \"Dunkirk serves up emotionally satisfying spectacle, delivered by a writer-director in full command of his craft and brought to life by a gifted ensemble cast that honors the fact-based story.\"Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded the film five out of five and called it Nolan's best to date, saying that he \"surrounds his audience with chaos and horror from the outset, and amazing images and dazzlingly accomplished set pieces on a huge 70mm screen, particularly the pontoon crammed with soldiers extending into the churning sea, exposed to enemy aircraft\". Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter also lauded the film, calling it \"an impressionist masterpiece\" that was \"deeply moving\" but without \"manufactured sentimentality or false heroics.\" He also praised the score, which \"enormously strengthens the film\" and \"incorporates both sound and music to extraordinary effect\". Peter Debruge of Variety praised the plot (although calling Zimmer's score \"bombastic\"), writing: \"[Nolan has] delivered all the spectacle of a big-screen tentpole, ratcheting up both the tension and heroism through his intricate and occasionally overwhelming sound design.\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times described the film as a \"tour de force of cinematic craft and technique\" and lauded Nolan's elastic approach to narrative. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle called it a \"triumph\" and \"masterpiece\", commending Nolan's unique approach to directing a war film and praising the performances. The Economist labelled Dunkirk \"a remarkable film\" and a new classic. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four and said it was one of the best war movies of the decade, describing it as \"tight, gripping, deeply involving and unforgettable ... triumph in filmmaking\". Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an \"A\", calling it the best of 2017: \"By the end of Dunkirk, what stands out the most isn't its inspirational message or everyday heroism. It's the small indelible, unshakeable images that accumulate like the details in the corner of a mural.\" Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave the film five out of five, lauding it as \"a work of heart-hammering intensity and grandeur\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded it his first four-star rating of 2017 as \"maybe the greatest war film ever\", adding: \"There's little doubt that [Nolan] has, without sentimentality or sanctimony, raised [the survival film] genre to the level of art...with the resonant force of an enduring screen classic.\" He also called it the first major Oscar contender of the year. Michael Medved awarded it four out of four and called Hardy's performance \"outstanding\", and the action \"seamless\", declaring: \"This is not only the best WWII movie since Saving Private Ryan, it is very simply one of the greatest war movies ever made.\" Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave it a score of three and a half out of four, despite not liking the film, stating that he \"loathed parts of it and found other parts repetitious or half-baked. But, maybe paradoxically, I admired it throughout, and have been thinking about it constantly.\" Jacques Mandelbaum of Le Monde praised the film's realism, but was disappointed that it ignores the part played by French troops.Kevin Maher in The Times gave it two out of five, saying: \"[Dunkirk] is 106 clamorous minutes of big-screen bombast that's so concerned with its own spectacle and scale that it neglects to deliver the most crucial element-drama.\" He also suggested that Dunkirk felt like a Call of Duty video game. David Cox of The Guardian felt the film had historical inaccuracies, a paucity of female characters, small scale, a thinly characterised cast and lack of suspense. In a literary review for the London Review of Books, Michael Wood compared it to the films of Luis Buñuel and commended Zimmer's soundtrack as an effective match to the film.[179]\n\nWhat a fine piece of philosophical, emotional, tragic, dramatic, thoughtworthy and different war film about the WWII mass evacuation of Dunkirk from Christopher Nolan. The film is split up in three perspectives: land, sea, and air. At first it was bothering me that Nolan wanted to create suspense more or less only from cinematography and music and add little or no dialogue. However, the longer the film runs the more comfortable you become with that conceptual structure. And it works in a very fine way. I think that some of the acting might not be perfect, but the acting that is perfect weighs over. Yes, I agree with the critisism that the character development is not fully satisfying, a bit thin, but I reckon Nolan wanted the focus to be on a bigger scale and not go too much down to the characters depth. If I have to pick a character, I do love Hardy´s Spitfire pilot. He does a great job with that character. Hoyte Van Hoytema´s cinematography is just magnificent, beautiful and crisp. I think it´s so beautiful it hurts within. The film is lovely shot in so many ways. It almost becomes a moving painting. You can say that the film in one way lacks an emotional core despite the tragic historic storyline, which creates a very cold and non engaging film, at the same time I reckon Nolan was going for something that wasn´t entirely going for emotional suckerpunches. \"Dunkirk\" is a technical masterpiece, but not a full on masterpiece. \n\nTrivia: According to actor-director Kenneth Branagh, roughly 30 Dunkirk survivors, who were in their mid-90s, attended the premiere in London. When asked about the film, they felt that it accurately captured the event but that the soundtrack was louder than the actual bombardment, a comment that greatly amused director Christopher Nolan.\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan focused on the \"realism\" of every aspect. For many of the cockpit shots he had a two-seat plane rigged so that the front canopy and cockpit looked like a real Spitfire but with non functioning flying controls and with the actual pilot flying the plane from the rear cockpit so that the actor could play the pilot as the plane actually flew. He also mounted front- and rear-facing cameras on a reconditioned Spitfire. In addition, he had cameramen floating in the water with actors.\n\nThe scene in which Tom Hardy's character's Spitfire lands on Dunkirk beach was real; done on location with an actual Spitfire in flight, and was the first time a plane landed on that beach since 1940. After the scene was completed, however, the Spitfire became stuck in the sand. There was subsequently a frantic rush to get the valuable Spitfire out off the beach before the incoming tides could damage it.",

Kenneth Branagh seemed to be a man without a care in the world. I could never get a Cessna to glide as far as that Spit, which with the enormous Merlin would have become a plummeter at that altitude. My uncle who was there in the RAMC said there were hundreds of bodies. Overall not a bad effort, it told the story in a new way, but was sadly disappointing somehow.

Dunkirk makes you empathize with the characters without even delving into their characters. This movie received a lot of negative feedback because it felt \"cold, unpersonal\" and other inaccurate words. Nolan didn't dive into the people because soldiers in the midst of a battlefield often don't get the chance either. 300,000 men were stranded on a beach with air-bombers flying over them, trying to destroy all of them. Did that give them a chance to crowd around a fire and sing \"Kumbaya\"? No, obviously not. A movie that causes audiences to be worried and emotional for characters that aren't developed is impressive, even if only for that. But Dunkirk does much more than that. It explores and oft-overlooked history of a wildly intense and harrowing part of a dark war, and yet it is somehow a light, though heart-pumping, film. One of Nolan's best.",

Director Christopher Nolan collaborates with a new partner, Hoyte van Hoytema and not with his a long time work partner Wally Pfister.  This change is impressive and serves the film with fresh inspiration which is an offshoot of the unfamiliar dialogue between director and cinematographer.\n\nWhile Dunkirk is a war film, violence is almost non-existent. The story is told entirely on the surviving party's point of view, more like \"Escape from Alcatraz\", and the civilians who orchestrate the rescue operation. Our job as moviegoers is to watch them escape the sparse but vicious attacks from land and air.\n\nThe pacing of the film is quiet, and the central character role is shared among a spread of noteworthy individuals, gracing us with rousing portrayals.\n\nAll in all, Dunkirk was for me hard to follow, as it is a silent film, a lot of hard work is required to understand it, I have since watched it three times, I finally succeeded when I switched on the Subtitles.\n\nNolan's wisdom is seen in the concluding scene where Fionn Whitehead read Churchill's \"We shall fight on the beaches\" speech from a newspaper article, this is a great move as we remain in the war setting without switching entirely to a formal political setting, away from the mess we are now accustomed to, the speech, an essential part of the film's conclusion, is placed within a familiar setting.\n\nTom Hardy can only be fully seen near the closing scenes, and he concludes the film in an emotional bend. We each character saying their goodbyes in different ways, even the fighter plane that played a pivotal role in the movie is reduced to flames as it burns to ashes; the leaping flames, some reflecting on Tom Hardy are similar to \"xenolinguistic\" form of goodbye between two alien entities. \n\nCillian Murphy plays his entire role almost wholly guilt-ridden and is lastly comforted by the father of the boy he killed accidentally due to his cowardice and selfish ambition in a time of war.\n\nThis gesture of comfort is woven in with the few final scenes as the soldiers are embarrassed for not fighting, one blind man congratulates the soldiers, giving each a blanket (as did the father in the story of the prodigal son), the soldier responds, \"We only survived\" to which the old blind man replies \"that's enough\". They are shocked at the reception, because they feel unworthy of it, they are deemed heroes nonetheless by those who did not fight in the war, their tears are dried by the blind, the old, and the prepubescent, they receive the embrace akin to that of the prodigal son received from his loving father who was looking for his son.\n\n\"Then I saw \"a new heaven and a new earth,\" for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea... He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death' or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.\"\nRevelations 21 verse 1 and verse 4",

'Dunkirk' presents a part of the WWII story that is not often told: that of soldiers who are desperate to get back home, thinking of nothing else but removing themselves and their brothers-in-arms from harm's way. Nolan, along with an amazing score from Hans Zimmer, manages to create a ridiculously tense atmosphere, doing his very best to put the audience in these young lads' shoes and give us a sense of the terror they must have felt, death awaiting them in every sound, shadow in the sky and ripple in the water. To make it even more astounding, he manages to do all of this with a surprisingly scarce amount of dialogue. This is a very different war film and, without a doubt, not as exciting or as action-packed as something like 'Saving Private Ryan', a fact that could serve as a disappointment for a lot of people.

Nolan tells this moment to us perfectly on screen, and I felt nothing but tension for the next several hours after I saw this movie. However, a film requires more than tension (not speaking of this historical event lacking importance but simply as a film). A film requires an arc rather than a scream of fright. A film requires a character to follow (most times), and while Nolan does give us that to a degree, it is the moment that he so desperately seeks to elevate, even at the expense of movie quality, and I can at least respect that kind of boldness as a filmmaker, but I can't say the movie improved all that much by it.",

It might be that he knows he's running out of gas, and decided Tom Hardy's gliding gasless fighter plane, which seemed to go on for the most ridiculous amount of time imaginable, was his admission that his tank is running on empty. Dunkirk outdoes Insomnia as his worst picture ever made.\n\nNolan preaches a very schooled idea about the power of visual storytelling, but he has trouble commanding this. This is his most erroneous overestimation by far; show anything behave any way and call it visual storytelling - eh eh. Someone forgot to remind Nolan that he's not Stanley Kubrick, who he pretentiously compares himself to far too often. There's never been a Kubrick film without humor; there's never been a Nolan film with humor. Dunkirk has no master visual plan to override the rules of good storytelling. \n\nIt's confusing, uninteresting, has no characters we can invest in, the situations are unclear, and the soldiers seem stupid. Worst of all, there are no relationships for us to connect any camaraderie with these men. They felt like a bunch of assholes. Nolan seemed to find his ending emotionally moving, regarding the characters we never cared about to begin with; wouldn't care what happened to them one way or another. Death never felt like losing people, it felt like losing props. The little dialogue we do get is clunky and cliché - one soldier actually philosophizing on why they need one man to leave a sinking ship.\n\nYou really didn't need an actor like Mark Rylance to spin a wheel for a whole movie. Kenneth Branagh, who mercifully isn't directing himself for once, just seems to do weird things with his mouth and never says anything useful, except that abominable Churchill exposition. Apparently, Chris Nolan only believes Tom Hardy can act with his eyes, once again placing him in the role of Bane, talking through an absurd face mask. Batman jokes are on us, next up is his arch-nemesis Scarecrow perched atop his sinking Batwing, squatting with his cape blowing in the wind, unmistakably resembling the Dark Knight. \n\nHans Zimmer certainly was reminded of the Caped Crusader, recycling the worst parts of his Dark Knight score that NEVER, EVER stopped playing. We seriously could've used a breather from his screeching tones, but we were left tormented instead. His 80s style synth is extremely out of place in this 40s set film. I can only see Nolan on his knees in front of Zimmer, \"please Hannie, string my movie together with anachronistic sound, for I have nothing else to thread these extremely plain images.\"\n\nThe movie lingers longer than it's purpose serves, drifting off to nowhere, having attempted to be experiential without an experience. Time go to back to the drawing board. Paths of Glory, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, and Full Metal Jacket... these are war pictures worthy of the cinema, layered with profound ideas that take us deeper into the psyche of the nature of warfare, and all it's consequences. And seriously, why the fuck is Bane gliding for days? Has he become the Batman?!",

            "content": "As both a history graduate who loves war films and a Christopher Nolan fan, I was looking forward to this film a lot. And if I'm honest on first viewing, I was left disappointed. This film whilst historically accurate for the most part, left out a lot of details that I would deem important or at least relevant. What were the French doing? What was the Nazi position? How did we get to this point? What happens after? These are all points that conventional war films would address, and I was disappointed to not get a full picture. HOWEVER!\n\tOn second viewing, I realised that this film is very well done and doesn't need to address these issues. This film follows 3 main characters, a soldier, a pilot and a civilian who answered the call to help the soldiers fighting for his country. We don't need to see the French participation, we don't need to see the enemies point of view, how we got there would have been a nice extra but ultimately, it would risk losing balance between the characters. What this film aims to do is tell the story of the event itself using very little story or characterisation, but focus on shock, detail and showing what happened not why or who was involved. This was about some people getting of a beach, that is all you need to know. What we get is a stellar score, impressive visuals and a plot in which without anyone saying a word, it evokes fear, pain and relief amongst many other emotions. Most of the characters don't even have names. We don't need to know their names, they are one of thousands, just one person who is in the same boat (not literally) as everyone else. They are heroes yes, but they all are. Also, from a realism point of view, in such horrendous circumstances, who would honestly care to ask someone's name anyway. This attention to detail works. This attention to detail provides a story from the soldier's perspective, where the greater politics at play are irrelevant, where the roles of the rest of world couldn't be further away from the minds of these poor people. \n\tAside from my initial criticisms, the only gripe I had was the timing of the film. Each of the main characters work on different time scales but are shown adjacent to each other. This was important because otherwise we would have seen some characters whose entire story lasts one hour for only a short period in the last few minutes and the tension would have been lost. Once you realise what is happening, it is easy enough to follow however if you don't understand, then this film is a mess.\n\tOverall, this film is beautifully shot and surprisingly educational and thought provoking for a film with next to no dialogue. The score is superb and lends to creating emotions in the viewer. This film has you on the edge of your seat and doesn't break away from this until the very end. It questions morals and leaves you guessing. The time scale could have been explained better however once you understand, it makes complete sense. This film will not appeal to everyone, it is to an extent a very experimental film, but I would certainly be happy to see more films done in this style.",

Whatever Nolan and Zimmer wanted you to feel during this movie, you sure felt it.\n\nThe actors were all perfectly fitting, each gave an appropriate and respectful performance, nailing the role of real people caught in the mess that was the Dunkirk evacuation.

True, it was difficult to make yourself care about each individual person you saw die on screen, but that's how it is in a war. There are countless soldiers, each one with his own story and emotions, but you don't get to see that. You have to somehow intrinsically know it and act accordingly.

It seems rather odd to see an excellent movie in the middle of July, with Oscar season so far away but when it's right, it's right. Nolan delivers yet again with a brilliant war movie that won't fly out of anybody's radar. The Dark Knight and Inception are both in my top 10 movies of all time and with good reason. An inescapable truth is that Nolan reigns way higher than the rest when it comes to blockbusters, he's a natural storyteller with a powerful and personal vision while being extremely marketable. Spielberg used to hold Nolan's place some years ago yet, judging by his record, it seems like Nolan will continue to have a much more sound and consistently brilliant filmography. His films don't fit in the category of entertainment, they are experiences. And never was that so true than in Dunkirk. It's easily the movie which is worth seeing in IMAX the most in a long time, as it throws you right to the action and doesn't let go: the action is wonderfully directed, the script is smart and the cinematography is something luminous to behold. The editing invents an ingenious and unconventional structure that adds to the suspense. Also, Zimmer proves his worth yet again with the magnifying score, making you feel small and as afraid as the characters. Ultimately, this films achieves its greater goal of having us engulfed in the story and fear for the relateable and fleshed out characters. It's moving, without being melodramatic. Men speak like real men, not like Shakespearean actors. Men react with a quiet reluctance, not with bursts of blatant and self-proclaiming heroism. Dunkirk reinforces that wanting to tell the whole war in just one film is a foolish dream. Saving Private Ryan, The Pianist, The Imitation Game, for example, are films that, by focusing on a particular event or character, provide us with a vision of the war that is inherently personal to the director and the screenwriter. Dunkirk follows some characters in a short period of time bringing them together to fight for a common goal.In that sense, it engulfs the spirit of war in a way never before seen on screen. Furthermore, it's a primary example of what to with a huge budget, as it's well managed and it will surely pay off for audiences. Also, at about 100 minutes runtime, this movie is as tight as a virgin asshole, contributing to the heart pumping experience. Dunkirk is a tremendous step forward for mainstream cinema and it reminds us that Hollywood still has a heart. Brava, Mr Nolan!",

Yes, there were vaguely thrilling moments, but overall one did not really care about what happened to any of them. If anything this was a bog standard war film without actual infantry combat. It somehow managed to be tedious while clocking in at under 2 hours. Long silent cuts are a great tension building tool, but you cannot make a whole movie using one strategy as a crutch and a professional should know this, as should all the critics fawning over it. Constant long silent cuts do not automatically make a movie deep and meaningful, it is in fact superficial and lazy.",

It inspired newly elected Prime Minister Winston Churchill to make his \"we will fight them on the beaches\" speech.\n\nThe Good: Christopher Nolan has shown himself a brilliant director since \"The Following\" in 1998 and simply has not been as on top of his game as in this film. He uses, what could easily be a gimmick, an anachronic order of three separate time lines told simultaneously. I usually dislike movies that are not told in a simply chronological order but it simply works brilliantly here fitting both the material and the stories told within.\n\nThe movie is also a wonderfully minimalist affair with music used sparingly to create a great effect when it does appear and a taut running time that bluntly is a relief. Too often both war epics, recent Christopher Nolan films (I am looking your way Interstellar) and \"important movies\" in general seem to pad the running time to a kidney-busting three hours packing every piece of flotsam and jetsam surrounding the main story hoping something sticks with the audience.\n\nThe acting and cinematography are also top notch. The air combat scenes filmed with real fighter aircraft of the era are a sight to behold and simply a triumph.\n\nThe Bad: While the anachronic order certainly does work brilliantly upon reflection of the entire film, one can find it disorienting during the actual viewing if one does not expect it going in.\n\nNolan does an incredible job recreating the time period using actual ships that were at the evacuation and filming on the actual beach. However, his refusal to use CGI does create a city of Dunkirk that is remarkable intact compared to the actual city of that day and a beach that is not strewn with the hundreds of tanks and thousands of vehicles the British and French abandoned. While that is certainly excusable as an artistic choice the modern seat patterns on the train are a surprising anachronism.\n\nIn Conclusion: As the son of a man who survived the blitz and a grandson of a Royal Navy officer, I am certain my tearing eyes and warm feeling during the film will not be shared by all. It is, however, even for those with no personal connection, a brilliant combination of direction, cinematography, and music that is a filmmaking triumph. One of the best film I have seen this year.",

None of us watched this when it came out into theaters, but we recently picked up the DVD at one of the few movie rental places that still exists. We were all really looking forward to the movie, and...\n\nIt's boring. Boring as all hell. I'm not sure how the score could be so high for both critics and audiences (well, I guess I get it for the critics, because it's artsy or something). I do appreciate that it came unsold with controversy (though the usual suspects made their complaints, because they expected \"diversity\" to over rule historical accuracy). Superficially, it was historically accurate, and I cannot think of anywhere to dispute accuracy per se, but did anyone at all have any real feelings of urgency during this movie? Great, it's not overblown with actions sequences and CGI, but there are few moments indeed of real conflict of that sort. The way the timeline jumped around was disorienting, but never did I (or my family) ever feel any sense of urgency in the entire film. It was all so much a bunch of waiting! Bored waiting, with a pinch of being shot at and bombed. These troops were under HEAVY pressure. They were about to be overrun and were barely saved. There's a reason why it was called the \"Miracle\" at Dunkirk, and its significance in the war cannot be overstated. This film is more like \"a thing happened\". I really wanted to like this film. My family really wanted to like this film. What we got was a major snooze fest, a bland, emotionally stunted waste of time.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan's latest offering is an accurate representation of an event that occurred in 1940 during WWII. British, Belgian and French troops were cut off within Dunkirk, surrounded by advancing German troops. The allies were literally fish in a barrel to the German forces. They were stranded, being attacked from both land and air with the sea to their backs, nowhere to run. \n\nSituated in Northern France, Dunkirk was the location of the massive evac operation which saw large numbers of British civilians man their own vessels in order to assist with the rescue. Up to 400 various manned craft were voluntarily used and braved the English Channel along with various military vessels. Despite the fact that German forces had halted their crushing advance on Dunkirk (giving the Allies some time to organise the evac), the Luftwaffe were still hitting the port and its beaches and enemy troops were still on the ground.\n\nNolan's film tells the story of Dunkirk from separate angles, land sea and air. The first angle is from a young British private called Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) who has survived a recent German ambush and has made his way to the beaches. We follow Tommy as he tries to get on-board a couple ships only for them to be sunk by German attacks. Tommy eventually ends up back on the beaches with some Scottish soldiers and a French soldier. The second angle is from RAF pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy) and two other Spitfire pilots who are part of the British airborne resistance against the German bombers. And the third angle is from a Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance), his son Peter and his sons best friend George. All of whom have volunteered to help in the rescue with the aid of Mr. Dawson's yacht.\n\nFirst off Nolan's film is not like most traditional films. There is very little dialog throughout the entire runtime; instead Nolan relies on pure visuals and the musical score to convey the films atmosphere. That is where the film may be problematic for many people, this isn't a war movie filled with blood, guts, gun battles and explosions. Obviously if you know about the actual historical event then you would know to expect this. The most dialog comes from the story surrounding Mr. Dawson and his son Peter, second to that would probably be Tommy's story, then lastly and most obviously is Farrier's story which is almost entirely conveyed through Tom Hardy's facial expressions.\n\nNow whilst I did fully appreciate Nolan's vision here, I have to admit to finding it somewhat odd watching a movie like this with little dialog. Looking at Farrier's story (the air section), it was indeed very impressive to watch these old Spitfires dogfight with German Messerschmitt's. Naturally it wasn't shot in the typical Hollywood action sequence type way. What you get are highly realistic air sequences which show the planes trying to manoeuvre into position to be able to attack each other. When the attacks come they are short bursts with very little fanfare. When a plane gets hit nothing much happens at first. The pilots communications are brief and not filled with silly quips. Basically overall it kinda feels like you're watching some kind of airshow display or training video, the fact everything is shot in natural light kinda adds to that.\n\nThe story surrounding Tommy is probably the most Hollywood-esque part of the movie, but it still may not please some. Once again this is a highly realistic vision, there are no 'Saving Private Ryan' sequences on this beach. The plot is straight forward, Tommy and another soldier try to board ships by using an injured soldier as their ticket essentially. That seems almost wrong but in the grand scheme of things who wouldn't do that? The fact that they try to get away twice and both times the ships are sunk did seem almost too unlucky to me. The fact that later on they reach another ship and yet again it gets sunk, kinda felt a bit overly dramatic perhaps. Did that many ships get sunk in the real event? \n\nTommy's tale certainly has the most cinematic visuals of the film, the numerous shots of the troops lined up on the beach are incredibly haunting, yet beautiful. Its easily the most intriguing of the three main plots but at the same time its also a bit too 'Spielbergian' methinks. When Tommy meets up with the Scottish soldiers things get a tad by the numbers and a little dull. I also felt the death of the French soldier (who was thought to be a Brit) was again a little touch of Hollywood which maybe wasn't required. It was too predictable, the minute he is exposed as French you kinda knew his number was up. I should add that whilst all this is going on we get little snippets of Kenneth Branagh as a Commander overseeing the operation from the beach. Again like Hardy he tends to emote through facial expressions more than dialog. \n\nFor me the weakest of the stories was following Mr. Dawson and his son. Call me shallow but this was simply because it wasn't really that interesting. I found myself yearning for the plot to get back to the beaches, or in the air with Farrier. Don't get me wrong, Mark Rylance puts in a great performance as the calm and steadfast Dawson, and its important to see the civilian angle of this story. The thing is it just wasn't really that intriguing watching this trio sale slowly towards Dunkirk.\n\nThe subplot of them rescuing a stranded officer (Cillian Murphy) from a shipwreck was also something of an odd addition. Murphy's officer is shell-shocked, he argues about going to Dunkirk and tries to stop Dawson. This leads to George (Peter's best friend) falling and badly injuring his head...which leads to his eventual death! I really didn't see the point in all this because it goes nowhere. Dawson and Peter lie to the shell-shocked officer about it and that's kinda that. Neither Dawson or Peter came across as upset when the incident occurred or when George dies. You're left wondering what happens with that. Does the officer get done for murder upon return to England? Would he be let off because of the fact he was shell-shocked?\n\nWould I say this is one of the greatest war films ever made? In terms of realism yes. In terms of score, cinematography and craftsmanship yes. In terms of engagement (for me the viewer) I'd say its up there, but maybe not the best. I totally and utterly shower praise on Nolan and co for their vision and what they have achieved here, the authenticity being the number one factor of course (score not far behind). But I cannot deny the film is a little slow at times. I hate myself for saying this but I did find myself yearning for just a touch of romanticised heroism or emotion just to get those waterworks going. \n\nThe final sequence showing Farrier taking out one last German bomber before he is forced to land in enemy territory from lack of fuel, was so fecking awesome. Seeing the Spitfire land in one shot on the Dunkirk beach was fantastic, as was seeing a stoic Farrier stare into the camera as he is captured and led away. But dagnabbit Chris, I just needed a hint, a mere drop of glossy sentimentality. The film was [b]so[/b] realistic that it didn't really feel like a film at times (again I hate myself for saying this). But bottom line, this film is a tour de force that ignores manufactured heroics and stereotypical Hollywood-isms.",

            "content": "Like most of Christopher Nolan's films, Dunkirk is awe-inspiring and almost feels like it has, for lack of a better term, swagger. It's so stylish and it feels like an event when you're viewing it. I think Nolan will grab the Best Director Oscar and while I don't think he deserves it for Dunkirk, I'm OK with it because I feel he's been robbed of nominations (and some wins) in the past for The Dark Knight (and Rises?), Interstellar, and Inception. As cinematic events go, though, Dunkirk is mighty fine. The decision to seamlessly switch between depictions of air, land, and sea in a highly unique historical battle was a good one and is handled with expertise. It's hard to reinvent a war movie, but that's one way to do it. The shortage of dialogue also allows the viewer to get immersed into the battle itself - another good choice. Because of these things, Dunkirk is now tracking in third place for Best Picture and could sneak in for a win. I think that would be a shame, though. I think the Director award is plenty. Firstly, the Battle of Dunkirk has an incredible story behind it - which you really don't learn in this film - and the \"big moment\" when the civilian boats arrive just doesn't feel big enough.  But, the real reason this movie doesn't deserve the big prize is that Nolan's creative decisions also took away the keyest of key elements of any truly great movie. There is virtually no character development in this film. And when you know nothing of the characters, how do you know to root for them and how can you be expected to feel anything when they cry, laugh, fight, or die? You don't feel anything, so in the end, this is just an incredible docudrama, not Best Picture.",

            "content": "The Call to Dunkirk\nBy Armen  Pandola\nDunkirk by writer/director Chris Nolan is the story of how the British at the beginning of World War II were able to snatch a small victory from the jaws of an enormous defeat.\nThe Germans had deployed their new military tactic, the Blitzkrieg, to run over the low countries, then conquer France in less than three weeks. In doing so, it defeated the combined French and British armies. The remnants of those armies found themselves on the beaches of Dunkirk, with the Germans on one side and the English Channel on the other.  While England was less than fifty miles away, there were almost 400,000 troops on the beaches of Dunkirk and evacuating them would not be easy.\nHitler was convinced by Air Marshall Goering that the task of eliminating the troops on the beach was best left to the Luftwaffe and that the ground attack should be halted. After weeks of non-stop attacks, they could use the rest.\nAt that time, the British had the largest fleet in Europe, but getting the troops off the Dunkirk beaches was a tactical nightmare. Large ships became easy targets for German bombers, especially the terror-evoking dive bomber, the Stuka.\nI saw Dunkirk at the Aero theatre in Santa Monica where the attraction was not only the large screen 70 mm presentation of the movie, but an after-movie talk with the writer-director, himself.\nDunkirk concentrates on three characters: a young British soldier's attempts to avoid getting killed (designated in the movie with the title, The Land), a British pilot's crossing the English Channel in a spitfire (the British fighter plane) to shot down German planes harassing the rescue attempt (The Air) and a 50-ish Englishman, played by Mark Rylance, who crosses the channel in his own small boat, the Moonstone to pitch in (yeah, The Sea).\nThe movie is all about the special effects and the visuals. There is no attempt to give any of the characters, even the main ones, any kind of back story. Yes, we sympathize with them, but they are fighting Nazis so it isn't that hard to guess where your sympathies will land.\nPerhaps no incident portrays the lack of any serious story telling in the movie than what happens to a teenage boy who makes the trip from England to Dunkirk on The Moonstone to lend a hand. Along the way, the Moonstone picks up a British sailor whose boat was sunk. He acts very strange and insists that the small boat turn around and go back to England since there was nothing that it could do at Dunkirk. Rylance ignores him and later tells his son that the man is obviously 'shell-shocked.' When this sailor tries to physically force Rylance to turn around the boat, he pushes the teenage boy down stairs and the boy hots his head which starts to bleed profusely. As they are caring for this young boy who appears to be in extremis, he says that all he ever really wanted is for his name to be in the local newspaper for doing something good. Need I tell you what happens when the boy dies and the Moonstone makes it back to England with a score of rescued soldiers? \nAnd that is how the entire movie moves along, one prodding moment to another. Yes, some of the visuals are very good and so is the sound. You may have noticed that I have not mentioned most of the actors. In fact, in 45 minutes of talking about the making of the movie, neither did Nolan. The actors are irrelevant to his way of making movies. He did go on and on about how he wanted to make a movie to a certain beat or rhythm that would go like a bolero with all crescendos. Yeah, right.\nThe hook for this movie is that it is 'unlike any other war movie.' Not really. The idea of isolating a few stories in a battlefield of dramas is as old as All's Quiet on the Western Front. Technically, it cannot hold a candle to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. And as for portraying the reality of warfare, Kubrick's The Paths of Glory is far superior.\nSo, why all the buzz about Dunkirk?  It is fairly short for a 'war epic' coming in at 1hr, 46m. And it does have the kind of appeal that video games have. In fact, there were many moments that made me think that Nolan was more inspired by Call of Duty than Battleground. If that is your kind of thing - and Dunkirk's box office of over $500 million is proof that there are a lot of people (my guess, mostly teenage males) who love this kind of mindless visual house of thrills - then go see it. Believe me, it's a hell of a ride, if not much of a movie.",

Der Film ist von Sekunde eins an spannend und flacht hinten raus nicht ab. Ein Grund dafür ist die besondere Erzählweise Nolans. Wiedereinmal werden verschiedene Zeitebenen gezeigt und der Zuschauer muss herausfinden wann und wie sich alles verknüpft. Aber auch die Musik die die ganze Zeit ein ticken einer Uhr nachahmt trägt zu Spannung bei, indem sie den Zuschauer ständig nervös macht. Der Film schafft es auch brutal zu sein, obwohl nicht auf jede Katastrophe die Kamera gerichtet ist. Aber die Bilder werden einfach im Kopf fortgesetzt, wenn ein Cut gemacht wird. Die Schauspieler machen ihre Sache auch großartig, aber manchmal wäre es besser gewesen die Figuren ein wenig mehr vorzustellen, sodass man noch mehr mit ihnen mitfiebern könnte. Abschließend möchte ich noch positiv hervorheben, dass man den Feind nicht wirklich zu Gesicht bekommt, dadurch kann diese Situation und die Brutalität von Kriegen auf andere übertragen werden und so hoffentlich auch Leute in der Zukunft vor Kriegen abschrecken. 9/10",

The cinematography is incredible and some of the best air warfare dog fights ever filmed. Beautifully filmed throughout. Although many complain about a lack of dialogue not shaping characters I think Tom Hardy’s character is the best example of not needing much dialogue to appreciate character development. He was fantastic in this movie and I would dare you to focus on just him for one viewing of this and disagree. This is one of the best films of the year and certainly one of Nolan’s best films.

Regardless of this disguise, which let us witness what happened to the characters and their bravery, the plot is the same: you have a bunch of unsuccessful people shine through their theatrical success by the end of the movie. Instead of actually representing the terrors of war as one would expect such a cinematic build would project, we are made to believe everything will end up okay, and are not presented with failure without it bringing greater success (ie. death of boy in boat for a greater cause or sacrifice of pilot for similar reasons). There is despair, but everything will be alright, which to me is the equivalent to any other typical sugar-coated American blockbuster movie where protagonists have their share of misadventures before ending with success to the goals they set out to reach. I despise the praise this movie gets for what it is not, merely because people were blinded by the premise to see it for what it is as a whole. A pandered tragedy. Nothing too surprising, considering that is the model pretty much all of Christopher Nolan's movies follow.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan doesn't hold back with his film about the military disaster that took place at Dunkirk. And the British heroism and bravery that helped keep it from ending the war. \n\nWar films are difficult to pull off with any real sense of being meaningful or memorable. But, if done right, it can be very impactful. \"The Thin Red Line\" is a good example of a war film being a great film, that takes place in a war setting. It accomplishes this by taking the theme of nature throughout. Nature outlasting humanity, our struggle being made analogous with nature. For instance, the comparison made of the soldiers being like \"ants climbing a hill\". \"Dunkirk\" does this as well, but in a much different way. \n\nThe theme of humanity or, more accurately, the dehumanization that happens in war time is thrown in several times. But Nolan never really delves into any deeper thoughts that this throughout the film and he never really attempts to. The biggest theme bandied about throughout the film is that of time. Right from the beginning we get a very tense score that literally has a ticking clock underscoring the music. This whole film is an exercise in building tension. And Christopher Nolan does this with incredible skill and finesse. It is remarkable the report that Nolan has with his long time collaborating composer, Hans Zimmer. They both understand each other so well and know exactly how to work together to build tension and create dramatic scenes. \n\nSo the score is fantastic for its purpose of creating tension. And there are quite a bit of great performances in here from very capable actors. None are ever pushed to their complete limits but none disappoint either. Some standouts to me being Cillian Murphy and Mark Rylance. The cinematography is not to be scoffed at either. The riggings needed to be done to film the fire fights with dramatic success is incredibly impressive. \n\nSo all the pieces in this film are done incredibly well. Now, in matters of story, Nolan also devotes himself to doing this historical event justice. And he goes to great lengths to make sure that it is impactful. Whether he jumping from the story thread on the beach, the airforce pilots in the air, or the civilian boats in the water. We never lose the sense of scope. The sense of impending doom, severity and desperation. We get amazing wide shots of the beach many times throughout the film to help remind us of the size of this event. \n\nChristopher Nolan makes an edge of your seat thrill ride of a war film with \"Dunkirk\". Which is it's greatest strength. But also, at times, one of its weaknesses. There are a few times that all the running and tension becomes a bit tedious. Never in the large sense but sometimes small scenes will be added to try to add tension when the tension is already fully understood. \n\nOveral, Dunkirk may not offer any new human insight. But it is a real and powerful telling of an important, and sometimes forgotten, event in world history. Told with great care by some of the greatest in their fields. It may lean a little heavy on British national pride at times. But it is an incredibly visceral experience and one that you will not soon forget.",

            "content": "In short, Dunkirk is a near-masterpiece. It's a thriller that puts you on the edge of your seat throughout the runtime and only lets up for small amounts of time. What makes this movie unique is that it doesn't focus on the characters, but the event itself. In most war movies, we focus on a single character as they go through an event. In this case, the movie focuses on the event itself. It does focus particularly on a soldier played by One Direction's Harry Styles, a father played by Mark Rylance, and a pilot played by Tom Hardy. However, there's no backstory on any of these characters. Instead, we only see them as they go through this event. We see from their perspective, the events of Dunkirk.\n\nThe movie has 3 different plotlines. One focuses on the soldiers stuck on the beach. The second focuses on a dad and his two kids who answer the call and head to Dunkirk to aid in the rescue, despite the danger involved in doing that. The third focuses on airforce pilots and their efforts to take down Nazi warplanes. Nolan switches between the 3 plots throughout the movie and they all join together by the end. This movie is a little under 2 hours long and it gets into the action almost immediately after it starts. There isn't much backstory provided, so it's important to research the background of Dunkirk before you go and watch this.\n\nDunkirk is more of an experience than a movie. The camerawork makes us feel that we're there right alongside these people. It makes us feel that we're in the war, instead of watching the war. The sound work influences this as well. When bullets are fired, they are as loud as real bullets. When planes approach the soldiers on the beach, their roar will almost make your ears ring. When a ships sinks, the camera is at water level showing struggling soldiers trying to escape. The camera shows the airplane dogfight scenes in detail. Since minimal computer effects are used, it makes it all the more real. In fact, some of the small boats that were used in the movie were the actual boats that aided in the rescue in 1940. It all feels as if a cameraman were there with the troops in 1940, filming what was happening in real time. It makes the movie very realistic and horrifying. You'll feel exhausted (in a good way) by the end.\n\nDunkirk's also almost a silent movie as the characters say few lines. The action and soundtrack propel it forward. While it could have provided more backstory on the event and the characters, Dunkirk is a fantastic movie. It's not as memorable as other movies, but the experience you feel while watching it is unlike any other film. I'd give this a 90%. It's the type of movie that's made for the big screen and you're doing yourself a disservice by not seeing it in a theater. Dunkirk is a unique experience that's worth seeing. It is a fitting tribute to the troops who served there.",

I found the story line sadly lacking as from my memory of the story and history I thought much more emphasis should have been put on the civilian armada that went to their rescue. Why Dunkirk stood out among all the battles and atrocities of WWII? Yes, they had one boat with father, son and a friend who was hardly necessary to story line, but in history there were hundreds of vessels of all sorts that floated. I remember having a real sense of pride in how we British non-combatants went to the rescue of not only our sons, fathers, brothers, but anyone on the beaches.This was not conveyed at all.Unbalanced and Missing major points.",

            "content": "Dunkirk is one of Nolan's finest movies yet and the greatest war movie of all time! The opening sequence features a group of soldiers in the town of Dunkirk and instantly the audience is taken right into action. The movie is solely about the evacuation and the troubles it took to rescue 338,000 Allies soldiers from the shores of northern France. The story is told from three perspectives and time periods, the mole (one week), the sea (one day), and the air (one hour). Each of these sequences is perfectly shot with Hans Zimmer's score adding suspense of every scene. The acting is also top notch with Fionn Whitehead leading the way at the mole. Tom Hardy is amazing as Farrier, Mark Rylance shines as Mr. Dawson on the sea, and Kenneth Branagh is effective as Commander Bolton. Those are only the big names, with the rest of the cast putting in strong performances. The timing of the three storylines may confuse some members of the audience, with events happening in the air early on being seen again later on from the sea and mole. However, it all comes together and is a minor issue that takes little away from the film. There are some heroic moments of the film, with Tom Hardy's Farrier sacrificing himself in order to take out last bomber. There are also depressing moments showing how dire the situation was for Allied troops and citizens. Although the rescue is seen as a miracle and happy event, it was a major defeat for the Allied troops but also a major turning point in the course of the war. Overall, Christopher Nolan has produced an epic masterpiece, with Dunkirk being one of the greatest films since \"The Dark Knight\" all the way back in 2008!",

Yet, I probably could have watched the film with no sound and have understood a lot of what was conveyed. The story itself consists of three interwoven parts, which, in some ways, play out as haphazardly as the historic events themselves.

Abandoning the more experimental themes he toyed with in Inception and Interstellar, Christopher Nolan has set out to make a mostly-straight war picture, shining his spotlight on a major test (and ultimate turning point) for the British armed forces. Told from three entangled perspectives - one each from land, sea and air - we see heroes, victims, cowards and lunatics emerge from what might have otherwise seemed a nondescript group of young men. It's far less bombastic than the standard combat film, with a soft, observant character and distinct lack of extraneous dialog. That reticence, paired with an emphasis on beautifully-composed photography, reminded me more of an art film than an action epic. The battlefield's thick tension is inescapable, though, always drawing us back to the moment, with the frightened skyward eyes and skittish, shell-shocked nature of nearby soldiers proving a constant reminder that arbitrary death could be mere moments away. It's also the rare positive example of a recent tendency toward uneven sound mixes: a barrage of gunfire or sudden, screaming airborne bombing run can pack a mighty punch.",

It is gripping and intense as all of Nolan's projects are, but it seems to be missing something.  \nTo me, the whole does not seem to equal the sum of its parts.  Despite a valiant effort, the human element felt somewhat lacking.  Also, the overlapping time frames were not as clear as they could be.  I was able to follow, but my parents were confused and needed more information.  Perhaps Nolan tried to do too much at once, but I was left with the impression of having watched something interesting and clever but largely hollow (which is a feeling that I get from much of Nolan's work).  Perhaps I just don't get it or am unable to connect to Nolan's films for some reason.  It isn't that I think they are bad.  I loved The Prestige and The Dark Knight, and I quite liked Dunkirk and Inception and Memento, but they all strike me as somewhat soulless.  They are clever, interesting, and thrilling, but they lack warmth.  For most of the films this works, but for a war film about how the regular people band together to pull of a great feat of courage, tactics, and humanity the lack of warmth looms greater and is more of a problem.  Helping one's fellow man should be something that brings people together, but Dunkirk offers very little sense of cohesion and collective struggle.  \nAll war films are propaganda to some extent, but this one feels like it doesn't know either how to do that or to not do that.  It seems to want to show the war how it was in all of its grey areas and confusion but also to celebrate Great Britain and the Spirit of Dunkirk, to have its cake an eat it too.  It seems to want to be both objective and subjective, and instead of doing wither credibly, it somewhat flounders in the middle.  \nPerhaps in a few years I will rewatch it and the individualistic, every-man-for himself nature of the film will seem less overwhelming, but at the moment this film feels to me like a solid and valiant effort but something of a lost opportunity.",

It's so bad, that you don't even notice that the second of the two protagonists never speaks.  Nolan tries to use music to bring drama to scenes that aren't dramatic.  I was extremely disappointed over this movie after all the hype.  It should have been a massive war movie, and instead was a walk on the beach.

With Hans Zimmer's score adding to the anxious feel of the film, Nolan adds yet another outstanding film to his collection",

The time skipping portions of the movie were quite unique to the movie and was very interesting to watch the first time around. I would be interested in watching a version of the movie that was entirely chronological and would probably prefer that over the theatrical version due to the time skipping only be interesting initially and afterwards becoming somewhat annoying.

        {
            "content": "Dunkirk is both the quietest and loudest of filmmaker Christopher Nolan's films. Known for lengthy, cerebral films overstuffed with exposition, Dunkirk is exactly the opposite: lean, action-oriented, even emotional. Driven neither by character nor story, the emphasis is all on the mise-en-scene, image and sound, the immensity of what is right in front of us as the audience, and in front of the characters. There are no wordy speeches explaining the situation or the character's backstories; the opening 15 minutes, which contain perhaps two sentences of dialogue, are thrilling with their immediate immersion of the audience into an impossible situation: hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers surrounded by the Germans on a wide open beach. Various images stick with me and still elicit strong feelings: an airplane without fuel silently gliding through the air; the eerie and discomforting feeling of a bombed ship tipping onto its side; the water level rising swiftly as men scramble to get above decks; a pilot struggling to free himself from his downed plane before he sinks with it; the sunset on the beach. The word that comes to mind for many of these images: majestic.\n\nSome critics have noted that it's difficult for them to find an emotional center to Dunkirk. They, perhaps, long for a character to connect with on a deeper level or a richer sense of affect than the film produces. For me, the entire film is emotion and affect. It left me weeping, both during the film itself, and long after I had left the theater. The immersive nature of the 70 mm and/or IMAX format created an enveloping atmosphere, where I could feel everything occurring on-screen. The blow of the gunshots, the shaking of the Spitfire engines, the ringing in the ears after a bomb explodes nearby-Dunkirk nearly drowns you in its wake. So much has already been said about the \"right\" way to see Dunkirk, yet perhaps the form and environment really do matter here-Nolan used IMAX cameras and 70 mm film for a reason. If you can see this film in a theater with the largest screen and loudest sound possible, it'll be worth your while.\n\nThe emotion goes far beyond the film form, as there are involving characters and rich performances throughout Dunkirk. Mark Rylance portrays a civilian boat captain charged with a mission to go to the French beach to rescue fellow Englishmen. His understated performance is marvelous, mostly for the rich presence of his voice. Equally calming and commanding, his tone and inflections, his rhythm and volume, elevate what could have been either a melodramatic or a mundane role. As a pilot of a British Spitfire plane, Tom Hardy gives an equally affecting performance, yet his performative power shines through his eyes. Even with his face covered in a pilot's mask and goggles for most of the film, Hardy conveys emotional depth and sincerity, sometimes only through raised eyebrows or squints. For both of these men, their decisions and actions are notable and heroic, with emotionally-rich performances almost entirely via facial expressions and posture alone. The weight of the narrative lies mainly on a young soldier portrayed by newcomer Fionn Whitehead (he's called \"Tommy\" on IMDB, but I can't recall ever hearing his name) and his struggle to find a way off the beach to get home. Though he's a bit devious and self-serving in his methods for survival, he's certainly no villain, and stands up for others in pivotal moments of decision.\n\nDunkirk's triune narrative structure weaves between various timeframes and perspective. With a week on the beach, a day on a boat, and an hour in the air, these temporal shifts may leave some viewers confused as to the progress of time. Sometimes what may be mere minutes feels like hours, and vice versa. Day and night overlap, and it can be difficult to discern just how long time has passed for certain characters. I think this confusion about the passing of time is intentional; it's a brilliant way to structure a war film, where a sense of time can become lost in both the chaos of the battle and the mundane waiting in between the intensity. Time has been a theme in Nolan's previous films: he danced around and reversed the timeline in Memento through keen editing and storytelling; time passes at different rates in the dream worlds of Inception and the extraterrestrial worlds of Interstellar. In Dunkirk, Hans Zimmer's pounding, emotive score is marked with a ticking motif, akin to a stopwatch clicking the seconds away. I can say with confidence that Dunkirk is overtly about time, its passage and nature, its power over us and our submission to its will. When one has to wait for days on a wide open beach while the enemy lurks unseen or drops bombs from above, time feels like an enemy. It was deeply affecting for me when Zimmer's clocklike score suddenly stopped at a key moment near the finale. The ticking stopped; time stood still, and victory can be found in sleep (another common posture where time passes unbeknownst to us).\n\nThe name Dunkirk literally means \"church in the dunes.\" Nolan's films are notably materialist, lacking any language or acknowledgement of religion or spirituality. While that mostly remains the case with this film, the opening title sequences describe the need for hope, for \"a miracle.\" Though this is likely in reference to \"the miracle at Dunkirk\" of the \"little ships\" who served as transports during the evacuation, it is worth mentioning that we are reduced (or elevated) to using religious language for this feat of bravery, courage, and human decency. When the little ships arrive, it's a powerful moment of catharsis-what the soldiers have been anxiously awaiting has arrived, and they are able to go home. The term \"Dunkirk spirit\" refers to the solidarity of the British people in times of adversity, the virtue that allows for a stiff upper lip and non-anxious presence in the midst of what feels like total despair. It's a virtue worth remembering and emulating, perhaps one we Americans could learn from. In our present American political climate, where divisiveness, deceit, and lack of accountability for actions or words are the modus operandi and everything (including people and morality) can feel temporary or disposable, the quiet resolve of dutiful service, courageous self-sacrifice, and compassion for others-even others seemingly undeserving of such compassion-is a breath of fresh air. When it feels like the present-day world is an environment marked by fear and chicanery, Dunkirk is a welcome reminder from history about the significance of survival and the powerful narrative of hope. Makes me want to drink a cup of tea and move to the UK.",

With Harry Styles turning in a surprisingly good performance as well. A must see for any Nolan fan. ",

In fact, I felt a lot like Elaine watching The English Patient in an episode of Seinfeld.\n \nThe actual evacuation at Dunkirk involved 400,000 men and hundreds of small boats. In this movie, it looked more like the evacuation of 400 people with about 30 boats. The movie did a terrible job of capturing the immensity of the task at hand. Everyone was lolling about like they were waiting for an Uber to pick them up. Dunkirk really didn't look that scary.\n\nThe aerial combat scenes were pretty lackluster too. There's the odd plane here and there, a lone bomber sinks every ship it attacks. A Spitfire runs out of fuel and the pilot glides up and down the beach for what seems like 15 minutes and even manages to shoot down a Stuka before landing on the beach. The director seemed to really love scenes of aircraft ditching in the drink. \"That looked great, let's do it again (and again)!\n\nI suspect that an awful lot of the hype around this movie can be attributed to Harry what's his name from what's that band being in the cast. None of the acting roles in this movie were particularly challenging and there were some pretty bland performances  by the stars. There weren't any DeNiros and the script didn't really call for any.\n\nThe scenes of ships sinking were pretty harrowing and that was the best thing about this movie.

It happens in real life, it needs to be like in real life. And Nolan just showed a full tech demo on what happened. It feels you're in there, it's definitely surreal.\n4. Every scenes are well presented. No fillers and shit. Very memorable. You can feel each and every survival scenes. \"I can't breath, I felt like drowning\".\n5.

            "content": "Dunkirk\n(2017)\n\nPlot:\nThe story unfolds on land, sea and air, as hundreds of thousands of British and Allied troops are trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk with enemy troops closing in. RAF Spitfires engage the enemy in the skies above the Channel, trying to protect the defenseless men below. Meanwhile, hundreds of small boats manned by both military and civilians are mounting a desperate rescue effort, risking their lives in a race against time to save even a fraction of their army.\n\nReview:\nThis is another movie from Christopher Nolan, which plays with time, and you have to use your head to piece it together. It portrays an evacuation from 3 different perspectives, land, sea and air, during the fall of France in 1940. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers have retreated to Dunkirk, and a young British private, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), is the sole survivor of a German ambush. The movie then follows his amazing journey to reach home, whilst being under severe attack, which kills many soldiers. While all this drama is happening at sea, a small fishing boat is trying to make his way to Dunkirk, so it can help to get some of the survivors back home but the captain Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) doesn't have a smooth ride, due to a wounded soldier that he saved along the way. Meanwhile, Farrier (Tom Hardy), is in the air trying to fight off all of the planes that are trying to destroy the soldiers below but he is also fighting for his life, due to low fuel and no support. I found this movie quite interesting, and cleverly put together but as there isn't much dialogue, and it takes some time to get going, I did find it quite boring in parts. Don't get me wrong, I totally respect Nolan for taking on an important period of English history but I found it quite hard to follow, especially with all of the different time shifts in the storyline. The acting was realistic, and the cinematography was truly amazing but like Inception and Memento, which were also directed by Christopher Nolan, you have to watch it a few times before you truly understand and appreciate his vision. Anyway, from an entertainment point of view, I have seen better and I can't help feeling that my expectations wasn't fully satisfied but it's still worth a watch, especially as Nolan doesn't release movies that often. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nChristopher Nolan, 47, has made some excellent movies to date, and his attention to detail is second to none. He first hit the spotlight in 2000 with Memento, which was a unique movie that was ahead of its time, and in 2002 he brought you Insomnia starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams. In 2005 he put all of his energy into the Batman franchise, bringing you Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and the Dark Knight Rises. In between those movie he directed the Prestige and the brilliant Inception, which I still don't understand, and then he made Interstellar in 2014. He was also the executive producer for Man of Steel, Transcendence Batman vs. Superman and Justice League, so he's been fairly busy, even though he carefully picks what projects to work on. He is definitely a unique director who gives every aspect of a movie much thought, and he directs his movies from an audience point of view. Personally, it does seems like you need a degree to appreciate his final product, and after watching the bonus disk of Dunkirk, his depth is way beyond your everyday director. Although I wasn't that excited about this movie, I still think that Nolan is a terrific director. \n\nBudget: $100million\nWorldwide Gross: $525.5million\n\nGenre: Action, Drama, History, War\nCast: Fionn Whitehead, Damien Bonnard, Aneurin Barnard, Barry Keoghan, Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, James D'Arcy, Cillian Murphy and Harry Styles. 5/10",

I just want the Nolan that made films like Memento back! At least this film has his non-chronological storytelling. Dunkirk is a WWII film about three stories about the struggling of escaping and saving British soldiers from surrounded enemies. Like I expected the cinematography and soundtrack look and sound so beautiful, but there is a moment of the generic violin that’s in every war film. The cast did a good job, but I was a bit disappointed at Barry Keoghan’s performance because it was weak compared to his amazing role in The Killing of a Sacred Deer. I excepted a typical WWII film, but it looks like Chris wasn’t easy to convince. There are a few moments of war cheese, but for the most part you don’t get the over exaggerating “War Is Hell” story. Most of the time, you don’t see soldiers fighting the enemy or even see the enemy. Dunkirk is a refreshing film from Nolan’s Blockbuster phase. 8.5/10",

There is no mind boggling theory or science or super hero \ninvolved. It is simply a tale of survival, of home, of helplesness, of death and of life. It isn't a tale of a hero, but of heroism. \nMost movies have a background score, but Dunkirk has a score which takes the centre stage to the point that sometimes it feels the movie is \nthe background and the music was the point all along. The rise and fall of Hans Zimmer's marvellous sounds are intertwined with some highly\nimpactful sound effects, which are complimented by, of course, a visually stunning film. Few dialogues actually make the movie songlike.\nThe style of narration is interesting, being divided into three equal but non linearly combined segments, each covering a week, a day and \nan hour. The cast fit well into their characters, Nolan's old favourites and the new discoveries all blending and shining against the cold \nsea and the barren beach. Harry Styles genuinely surprised me, maybe because I wasn't expecting much from him. \nDunkirk is a refreshing experience, one that will leave you well reminded of the futility of war and pining for home if you live away from \nit.",

Christopher Nolan sensibly pares back the vast possibilities of the setting to focus closely on the story of a handful of players. We have the fighter pilot, the soldier on the beaches and the civilian in one of the flotilla of little ships. There are other players as well but sensibly, our involvement with them is kept to a minimum. Right from the outset, this movie is a proper, heart-racing spectacle, made all the more powerful by our personal investment in the characters. The acting is top-notch and it is a true ensemble piece with no one actor out shining another.

After thinking about it, I believe this was done because the filmmakers wanted to tell each subplot at the same time for a more balanced experience. Regardless, it took away from the film.\n2) To try and add tension to scenes, they implemented a choppy score and it was more annoying than anything else.\n3) This is a minor criticism in relation to how it effected the film, but intentionally making a war PG-13 is compromising quality for profits. There's a huge difference in box office results if you get the rating down to a PG-13, but making the film R-Rated would have helped underscore the terror of the situation.\nI enjoy Christopher Nolan's work, but this could have been much better. 6/10.",

With every new film of his, the viewer wonders what new odyssey he can create to dazzle and amaze the full spectrum of film viewer: casual to devoted film aficionado.\n\nDunkirk is something new. Not just for Christopher Nolan, but for cinema altogether. You've never seen a war movie such as this. There are no superficial friendships forged between any of the main characters we follow. There are no eye-rolling lines of sentiment followed by death. And most importantly, there's not a single reprieve from the mental and physical tolls of the ultimate brutality which is war as we know it.\n\nThe direction and cinematography are flawless, as is the acting. Although one main criticism I've heard is in regards to the lack of dialogue, the amount of realism this adds only serves to better highlight the immaculate acting and performance which takes place before our eyes. Whitehead, Styles, and Lowden in particular excel in bringing an atmosphere of high anxiety, and claustrophobia to the film as they struggle just to survive the evacuations as France completely falls to Nazi Germany. As do Cillian Murphy and Kenneth Branagh further pit the audience against the looming outcome as the enemy gets nearer and nearer while plans for escape fail and result in increasing hopelessness and distress.\n\nIn case I haven't made myself perfectly clear, Dunkirk is an absolute masterpiece from beginning to end.",

The appearance of Kenneth Branagh, in a supporting role, was unnecessary and distracting (I love him, but just leave him out of this one...the film did NOT need big stars).  Wars don't have romantic musical accompaniment, but it is the rare director that has the guts to leave the music out.  This film would have been MUCH more powerful and impactful without the music.

The film is, unsurprisingly, terrifically shot, spectacularly edited, and as with nearly all of his films, a genre film that attempts to separate itself from its peers. Nolan's choice to skip out on the backstories of characters proves to be genius - we don't need to know their stories in order to relate with them. Nolan puts the viewer directly with these men in battle and we feel what they feel and see what they see. Hans Zimmer's score helps rack up the tension and give the mostly dialogue-free film a heightened sense of urgency. Nolan's biggest misstep is his reliance on a non traditional narrative - a classic Nolan storytelling technique, Unfortunately, it really hurts the story here. The film is so straight forward and narratively succinct that the non-linear narrative seems out of place and becomes a distraction that takes away from some key emotional moments.

But that story has already been told in other movies, and this one is by Christopher Nolan - who wouldn't have undertaken this project if he didn't have an original take on it. This, however, has its pluses and minuses.\n\nFirst the pluses: 1) Suspense. The ending of the operation is well known, so Nolan has chosen to focus on three groups of individuals whose outcomes are uncertain. Consequently, we can be emotionally invested in their journeys, never knowing what their fates will be. 2) Intensity. Jeopardy is the operative word here, as one catastrophe after another befalls the characters, pounded home by Hans Zimmer's insistent score. 3) Scope. On land, sea, and air, we are drawn into the war, not as mere observers, but almost as participants. This, I believe, is the major achievement of the film: how closely we can identify with the individuals (even if we don't always know their names). 4) Cinematography and Editing. It is shot beautifully, while looking unlike any other war film in memory. Individual takes are allowed to go on until they naturally conclude, without the frenzied cutting which has been in vogue for far too long. 5) Payoff. In its final scenes, as if to reward the viewer for his travails, Dunkirk provides the emotional uplift one would expect from the whole story. One comes away feeling pride for the wondrous accomplishment, and moved by the words of Winston Churchill. (There is no better way to end a movie than with the words of Winston Churchill.)\n\nNow for the minuses: 1) Clarity.  While it is fascinating to see three stories, each in its own timeline, and ultimately satisfying to see how they eventually mesh - because this a Christopher Nolan film, its chronology was unnecessarily confusing. Clarity should never be sacrificed for the sake of mere style. 2) Torture. There are some films that appear to be designed to torture the audience, by having its members suffer along with the protagonists. (Papillon comes to mind.) Nolan should have curbed his fondness for depicting drownings, unless his purpose was to leave viewers gasping for air. 3) Characterizations. We never really get to know the individual characters, except for the boatman, impeccably played by Mark Rylance - but even with him, it comes much too late in the story.  \n\nOverall, I would say that this is a very good, but not great, film, even though Christopher Nolan is a great filmmaker. I'm glad I saw it but, unlike Darkest Hour, I would not want to see it again - although I'm eager to see his next film.",

His careful treatment of the emotions of soldiers and civilians alike is lifted tremendously by Hans Zimmer's aural work. The music provides a palpable tension that hits crescendo just as the most powerful characters, Fionn Whitehead's Tommy and Mark Rylance's Mr. Dawson finally meet. Though the twisted chronology was perhaps at times better suited for earlier efforts like Inception, Nolan's story pays respect to the men of Britain and the fact that the Dunkirk evacuation is to be remembered fondly.",

            "content": "It's now fair to say that Christopher Nolan has become a director that instils huge anticipation when he announces a new film project. He's equally adept at providing low-key, personal, thrillers like Memento and Insomnia and more than proved his worth with big-budget spectacles like The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception and Interstellar. It's fitting then that he tackle a war drama - a genre that demands an element of both approaches. After Steven Spielberg shell-shocked us with Saving Private Ryan and Terrence Malick encouraged us to ruminate and philosophise with The Thin Red Line, anyone treading the same ground had huge boots to fill. On this occasion, Nolan does an admirable job but I'd have to be honest and say that he doesn't quite reach the high benchmark that had already been set by these contemporary films.\n\nPlot: In May 1940, WWII, the German army  advanced into France, surrounding 400,000 Allied troops on the beaches of Dunkirk. Using every means possible, an evacuation plan took place that, if unsuccessful, meant the tide of the war would have almost certainly swung in the Nazi's favour and would've had worldwide implications. \n\nWhere Malick and Spielberg excelled in the land battles of WWII, Nolan's biggest achievement is in the air or at sea and it seems to me that this was a safe and deliberate approach. The Thin Red Line and Saving Private Ryan are hard to match in my view and Nolan is astute enough to know this. As expected, he goes big but although it sounds like a paradox, he also keeps the film very intimate as well. There are some impressive scenes on a huge scale but, to my surprise, Nolan focuses more on the intimacy of the men stuck in this horrendous battle for survival and that's ultimately where my surprise led to feelings of disappointment. Nolan keeps the running time fairly brief for a story of this magnitude but I couldn't help but feel there was more to tell here. It's hard to describe as this film really should've been something that I fully embraced. I normally love big spectacle war movies and I'm somewhat fascinated with the history of WWII but, with this in mind, Dunkirk left me a little cold. The script is threadbare, to say the least, and there isn't one particular character to pin any attachment to. The triptych nature of the film dedicates itself to the troops of the land, the sea and the air but, unfortunately, these three stories didn't quite come together as a whole. It felt disjointed and in some instances, incoherent, with neither one of the stories feeling like it had any real substance to it. \n\nI consider Malick's The Thin Red Line a masterpiece and Spielberg's effort just as much (minus the flag waving jingoism) and while Nolan had a similar opportunity here, Dunkirk lacked the emotional core that these two films so viscerally provided. Ultimately, Nolan comes to the table with a vision but fails to bring a script with him. At the time of writing this, I can't even remember one characters name. You could say that this was Nolan's intention in that it's a collective experience and no individual man is at the forefront but then why cast such recognisable actors as Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy only for them to be woefully underused? Hardy, in particular, spends the majority of his screen time with a mask on his face (The Dark Knight Rises, anyone?) while saying very little and although he's involved in the film's most impressive scenes while navigating the ariel battles in his Spitfire, these moments don't need an actor like him where he's unable to provide his usual gravitas. It's also a bit jarring that you're constantly reminded that it has a member of pop band One Direction. This is no criticism of Harry Styles - who happens to be quite decent - but why do it in the first place?\n\nAs a visual spectacle, Nolan really provides the goods and he's aided immeasurably by the exemplary work of cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema with his stunningly captured landscapes in bringing a real vastness to the experience while Hans Zimmer's score compliments the visuals and contributes a tense and nail-biting vibe to the action. It's, undoubtedly, a beautifully shot film but it's not as the critics have described and I just feel that the story of Dunkirk could have been given a bit more justice. It's a good film but, sadly, I expected more. Nolan manages to take a moment in history - that I respect and care deeply about - but depicts it with characters I couldn't care less about.\n\nMark Walker",

He tries to convey the urgency and desperation by stringing multiple sub-plots together, switching back and forth between them. There are elements in this which leave a lot to be desired. As a case in point the pilot who's plane has run out of fuel somehow manages to remain airborne long enough to turn his aircraft and shoot down another enemy fighter and is still in the air when everyone else has evacuated from Dunkirk. How the hell is that believable? Additionally, I hate the way Nolan mixes Cinemascope and Widescreen aspect rations throughout the film and uses constant width instead of constant height. This makes it look like he has made the movie for TV and not done the audience any favours because the Cinemascope scenes will be letterboxes on a TV. Why you would do this is beyond me, but it is not the first time he has done it. He did the same thing in Interstellar. It is absolutely crazy and my pet hate about theses two movies. 2.40: 1 should be a much bigger picture than 1.78:1 (widescreen) not smaller! Very disappointing.",

It is completely apolitical. And with the style Nolan took I don't resent him that. I don't think this is the question of political correctness. And from this point on the movie differentiates from the rest. The movie feels more like a myth than a record of historical event. Of course it is a record of historical event to some extent. But it is more like watching Greek mythology. Where soldiers are trapped in the land of the dead and shores of Dunkirk are just the entrance of the Hades' underworld where he with his two brothers Poseidon, the god of the sea, and Zeus, the god of the sky, tries to seal the fate of soldiers. And English channel is the only way in and out of the underground. All the small boats remind us of Greek mythology but instead of sailing people into the underworld here were trying so save them from certain death. Because soldiers were on the other side in Hades' realm they were powerless even though there were 400.000 of them. They were half alive and half dead. They seem mostly indifferent. It's like most of them were under some kind of spell. Waiting, doing nothing, without true emotions and feelings just some gloomy dark fear was tearing them apart.

Part of the problem is that, as per usual in his movies, there's a certain disconnect that you feel from the characters. You certainly grasp the magnitude of the situation and why it was terrifying, but you don't get a real sense of what makes these characters tick or why you should care more about them rather than the thousands of others who also played a part in Dunkirk. The main players feel anonymous, but perhaps this is the sort of feeling Nolan was going for? If so, I'm still not sure that it actually works all that well. Also, it's as if Nolan is constantly building up to something that never arrives. There's plenty of  shots of planes flying in the distance, beaches and countless soldiers, but I was waiting for the moment where I could go \"wow\" and proclaim this a masterpiece, but it never came. This might sound like a negative review, but it's not intended to be. 'Dunkirk' has some great moments, ones where you feel like you're really in the cockpit of a plane, or a boat about to be sunk by enemy fire. The cast gives solid performances, enough to makes the proceedings interesting if not completely engrossing. The special effects are also first-rate, and Nolan uses a subtle touch that serves things well. Instead of constant, graphic violence, he uses these sequences as punctuation points rather than the driving force of the plot. It may seem tame at first compared to other war movies, but ultimately I came to appreciate this approach. In the end, I wouldn't rank Dunkirk with the best war movies of all time, as even the more recent \"Hacksaw Ridge\" delivered a more powerful narrative, but 'Dunkirk' is still a respectable effort.",

Even if the dialogues are sparse, you feel there is a very good reason for it. The actors are really good and seems all marked by the war in some ways. The film is more about the action then the strategy that went into the actual event and not war movie that focus on the bloody part too much. The planes scenes were my favourite because they show how hard it was to use them. The sky camera angles are spectacular and gives you the impression of being in the plane. I think the flashback between the planes and the boats can be hard to understand at first viewing. When I saw it a second time I was able to better connect the timeline. And in a way it made first viewing an exercise of connecting the dots... Otherwise this movie is intense because it doesn't really stop that much. It's nice to see Nolan getting behind an historical event, and see how he presented this. He did it with a certain form and style, with beautiful photography. I give it a 88%.",

It's extraordinary how the director/writer developed 3 stories in this suspenseful war film. The 3 stories are the Mole, the Sea, and the Air. The film has a non-linear narrative and it works. If you're familiar with Memento, One of Nolan's first films, you would be familiarized how it definitely worked on this film. The film is a 1hr 47min non-stop shootout sequence. This film is the All Quiet on the Western Front, Speed, and Unstoppable of war movies. Nolan's direction was very superb and he deserved his first Best Director nomination. Hoyte van Hoytemma's wowing cinematography is worth to see this movie on an IMAX screen. The cast had great performances. Especially, Fionn Whitehead, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Harry Styles' performances. And you know how the performances were from Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy. They worked with Nolan in his past films. They're great. In terms of its sound design, it makes you feel like you're actually in the battlefield. This film should be nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing. 9.0/10.",

            "content": "A pulse pounding action torpedo strike to your senses.\n\nChristopher Nolan's historical war thriller Dunkirk (2017) is like Nolan is holding your underwater while you're getting shot at from all sides. Dunkirk spectacularly recreates the pivotal turning point for British military morale during World War II. Nolan strips away the bulk of his usual exposition for a wholly unnerving experience as you are forced to empathize with what British and French soldiers went through in attempting to flee from the wide open beaches of Dunkirk with no Naval support, minimal air support, no supplies, and no escape routes. Nolan's script is blunt and honest. He gives fair credit to the brave men that went to save 400,000 lives at Dunkirk, as well as a fresh perspective on the soldiers left to die at Dunkirk.\n\nChristopher Nolan's direction is impressive and focused for Dunkirk. You are always following a person's perspective with incredibly difficult situations. Nolan not only gives you the brutal experience of surviving aerial fire from German planes and U-Boats, but also the human struggle to cooperate in hard times. The oil fire and plane combat sequences are phenomenal. All the flooding ships lead to 107 minutes of pure agony and action within Dunkirk. Lee Smith's editing takes you cleverly from soldier to sailor to pilot and back again with seamless cuts creating an exponentially terrifying thrill ride. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is inspired as you can see his wide shots of Dunkirk's beaches, widespread ocean views, and hellish fire igniting over water.\n\nDunkirk ensures that you are rattled constantly as a viewer through sudden gunfire, fearsome explosions, rushing water, and inescapable ships all set to Hans Zimmer's chilling score. His music crafts an incessant uncomfortable atmosphere with a sense of fearful unease. His sonic choices for songs like The Mole, Submarine, or The Oil are harrowing to hear. If you listen to his fast thudding drums, eerie violin notes, or rising horns, you can distinguish each instrument's terrorizing noise over all the visceral action in Dunkirk. His music makes the outstanding special effects, mini models, and real practical explosions all the more horrifying.\n\nFionn Whitehead is fantastic as the desperate soldier Tommy trying to live by sneaking on board ships and swimming for safety. You see realistic despair and defeat on his face and in his eyes. Tom Glynn-Carney is emotive as the brave and kind Peter. Barry Keoghan is great as George, who just wants to help save sailors and soldiers alike on the boat. Aneurin Barnard is excellently expressive as the Frenchman Gibson with his facial acting of fear as he desperately looks for salvation. Jack Lowden is excellent as a skillful pilot who does his duty named Collins. Tom Hardy is phenomenal as a pilot named Farrier, who overcomes adversaries and obstacles to become an aerial hero. Harry Styles gave a phenomenal, and probably my favorite performance in Dunkirk, as the self-preservationist Alex. He's quite compelling for a pop star turned actor.\n\nMark Rylance is kind and subtle as the boat captain Mr. Dawson. Kenneth Branagh is excellent as the steadfast Commander Bolton of the Royal Navy. Cillian Murphy is unbelievable as the shivering soldier with shellshock. Michael Caine even cameos as Radio Command with his voice over Tom Hardy's speakers. Nolan's cousin Miranda Nolan cameos as a nurse on the ship and her father John Nolan cameos as the old man at the trainyard.\n\nIn all, Christopher Nolan makes great use of his phenomenal cast and outstanding special effects for an exciting war movie unlike any other.",

Number Two- The film really brings the real life events that happened over in France to light in such a way, that even though I have no knowledge of what actually did happen over there, (with the exception of the film of course), that I can't help but feel that this film succeeds in it's ultimate task of honouring the real life heroes and helping us to realize just how much courage that they actually  did display in their insane fight for survival).

But while the earlier film was a melodramatic piece of wartime propaganda to rally the Allies, Christopher Nolan's current look back is a visceral \"you are there\" piece of bravura filmmaking that likely also stokes the patriotic home fires in the Brexit-era UK (or perhaps it is meant to remind them of their bonds with Europe?). No doubt this looked better on the big screen than on the back of the seat in front of me on Qantas Flight 7, but it was still immersive enough. We follow three storylines that intersect at Dunkirk where Allied troops were besieged by the Germans and ultimately evacuated by an armada of private yachts and small boats sailed by civilian volunteers. The storylines are:  1) A couple of nameless soldiers attempt to escape on a first aid vessel (which is promptly sunk) as bombs drop everywhere on the beach; 2) a pair of pilots shoot down enemy bombers, hoping not to run out of fuel; 3) a father and son (and a local boy who joins them) take their small boat to Dunkirk and rescue a shell-shocked airman on the way.  There is very little dialogue, an immense crowd of extras, and a soundtrack that propels everything forward, sounding not unlike the dropping of bombs. I suspect that without the soundtrack, courtesy of Hans Zimmer, this film, like many others, would lose a lot of its impact. That said, the meticulous attention to authentic period detail is truly impressive.  These elements combined make this a film that could (and probably should) be watched again (on a bigger screen).",

The characters were amazingly developed this way. I love the constant ticking of the clock throughout the film and how the film followed those on land, at sea, and in air. The sound mixing was amazing and every gunfire made the theater shake. There were plenty of points in this film where you will be gripping your seat, if not already on the edge of it.

            "content": "Dunkirk is expertly written and directed by Christopher Nolan and to put it simply; it's a breathtaking spectacle. The film is a World War II thriller focusing on the desperate evacuation of troops from the beaches of Dunkirk before the Nazi forces arrive. From the opening sequence, hell, from the opening shot I was fully locked into this story and the characters and emotionally invested in every damn moment. Every second is intense and gruelling and you barely get a chance to breathe as there is a constant sense of imminent danger that never leaves, even in the happiest of moments. The cinematography from Hoyte Van Hoytema (Interstellar(2014)) is absolutely stunning, there are countless moments where I found myself getting lost in the simplistic beauty of a number of shots. The performances across the board are emotionally riveting and they all combine in what is hands down the best ensemble of the year. \n\nThe telling of this incredible story is executed in a very unique and refreshing way and one which I won't spoil here as I believe it is well worth experiencing the journey on your own. But it sucks you in from the perspectives of multiple different characters operating in different areas who all have a crucial role in the evacuation at Dunkirk. It never once stutters or skips a beat from start to finish and is truly mesmerising every step of the way. Each perspective that is focused on here is unique yet unified by everyone being affected by the same harrowing event. I mentioned the brilliance of this ensemble cast where every contributor is phenomenal but if there's one person that shouldn't be overlooked it's Fionn Whitehead who plays the lead role in Tommy. He was emotionally captivating from the get-go and sold me completely on every bit of desperation and fear he experiences. The rest of the supporting roles though, from everyone including Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, and even Harry Styles put their all into each of their roles and all elevate what is a near imperfect film. \n\nIf it wasn't for this year's release of Blade Runner 2049 this movie would undoubtedly be my #1 pick for the academy award for best cinematography because it is just astounding. The entire film has been shot in IMAX 70mm and it shows as this format adds to the spectacle in every way it possibly can. And one cannot talk about Dunkirk without acknowledging Hans Zimmer's jaw-dropping score that builds the eerie and horrifying atmosphere surrounding the soldiers at Dunkirk. You will find yourself lost in this time period as the score does it utmost to put you in the soldiers shoes. But as incredible as each of these departments is executed it is very clear this entire film is put together under one mans unhindered vision; Christopher Nolan. He pulls everything together magnificently and it all works to form what is one of the greatest films of the year and one of the best war films in history. \n\nSo in the end expect Dunkirk to make a big splash come Oscar season in a number of categories, but even if it doesn't win a lot you can be sure it will be represented in the nominations thoroughly. If you are a fan of war thrillers then this is a movie you absolutely cannot pass on as it will affect you emotionally through this gripping telling of what occurred on the beaches of Dunkirk. \n\n9.8/10",

In the world that Chris Nolan bring to life, every second matters, not every bullet.  The threat of the Nazis is a constant and looming presence, but outside of the occasional airplane, we almost never even actually see them.  Rather than diminishing their role as villains, this makes them an almost ever present enemy- the Axis powers aren't nowhere, they're EVERYWHERE, and it's terrifying.\n\nThe film's structure is strange and not all viewers will initially pick up on it even though the movie lays it out pretty honestly (it took me a bit) but it allows the film to play with Time (one of Nolan's apparent passions) without breaking the believably of the film.  I appreciated that, because even though I was excited for a Nolan WWII film, I was concerned that it would have to lack some of the typical weirdness of his typical fare.  Fear not!\n\nOne final thought- if you're concerned about the kid from One Direction being in the film, know that he's actually not at all bad in it, and is almost not even recognizable.",

Of course we never actually see a Nazi in the entire movie.  The battles in the air are cool if you could only tell who is who and where they are going or why.  I don't think you can make an interesting movie about Dunkirk because nothing actually happened other than an evacuation.  Does that sound interesting?  Well spoiler alert.  IT'S NOT!  Maybe DUNKIRK 2: Electric Boogaloo will be entertaining, have a plot, or names of characters.",

            "content": "I could (and maybe I should) left this sentence for the end of my review, but: \"Dunkirk is one of the best movies of 2017, by far\"! \nIt has been three years since the release of Christopher Nolan's last movie - Interstellar (2014) - but it was worth the wait! In fact, it took three years for Nolan to bring us the best movie he has ever made. The story is set amid World War II, during the evacuation of the Allied soldiers from Dunkirk, France (1940), told by three different perspectives: young private Tommy (The Mole), Mr. Dawson (The Sea) and a RAF pilot named Farrier (The Air), played by Fionn Whitehead, Mark Rylance and Tom Hardy, respectively. \nWhitehead proves to be a cinematic revelation and a very promising young actor, not only because of his beautifully subtle performance but also because of being able to be such a commanding presence on-screen without a showy character, being able to stand-out from the amazing ensemble cast. Mark Rylance was given the most inspiring and good-hearted character in the whole movie and his performance is just perfect. Tom Hardy has his face hidden once again (remember The Dark Knight Rises and Mad Max: Fury Road?), but his expressive eyes, breathing and the simple way he speaks turn a difficult role into a fine leading performance. The rest of the cast does fine, but let me highlight Cillian Murphy who portrays an unpredictable traumatized soldier - a dynamite performance! \nThe story and the acting are strong, but what really elevates Dunkirk to the masterpiece category is its director's craft! This movie is an amazing cinematic journey: all works perfectly so you can almost live and breed inside the movie. The original score isn't Hans Zimmer's most beautiful work but it works fine its purpose: building momentum for the release of human emotions. The sound work is stunning and somehow Nolan found a way to bring visual beauty to a war scenario: from corpses on the beach to the landscapes seen from RAF pilot's eyes. \nDunkirk stands as one of the most well-done and beautiful WWII movies. An ambitious extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan's best since Memento or Inception - Dunkirk is a masterpiece on the most immersive and epic scale!\n.\n5/5\n.\nOriginal review: cinemaandpopcorn.blogspot.pt",

            "content": "Chegámos a um ponto na história do cinema em que o nome do diretor tem tanta ou mais influência que o nome de um ator. Nomes como Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg e Christopher Nolan são alguns exemplos desta realidade. Realizadores com uma visão muito própria e um talento natural para contar histórias através de imagens. É quase impossível não ficar exaltado quando um filme destes diretores está no cinema. Este não foi exceção.\n\nDunkirk é o mais recente trabalho do magistral realizador e argumentista Christopher Nolan, e conta a história real de uma evacuação durante uma batalha perdida por parte das forças aliadas, durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial. Soldados ingleses, franceses e belgas estavam de costas para o mar, completamente cercados pelo inimigo à espera de uma morte certa. Nolan conta-nos a história de uma forma original e cativante, que demonstra a crueldade e monstruosidade da guerra, evocando sentimentos como medo, insegurança e desespero sem recorrer a imagens grotescas ou sangue.\n\nA película apresenta uma estrutura não convencional e características únicas dentro do género. Aclamados filmes de guerra, tais como Saving Private Ryan (1998) e Braveheart (1995), possuem os conflitos enquanto contexto histórico. São o plano de fundo para contar histórias de personagens envolvidas no cenário. Nos filmes referidos, esta ideia é executada de forma brilhante.\n\nPorém, aqui Nolan faz algo bastante ousado. Não nos apresenta personagens principais. A situação em si é a personagem principal, a magnitude da possibilidade de 400 mil homens perderem a vida, aliada a uma série de fatores técnicos, foi o suficiente para ter uma experiência repleta de tensão e ansiedade. Na minha ótica, a intenção foi expressar que todos os envolvidos naquela horrível situação tinham o mesmo desejo, sair o mais rapidamente daquela praia. A ansiedade no interior dos soldados acumulava a cada minuto que passava, era palpável.\n\nToda a tensão foi criada através de cinematografia precisa - não houve uma única imagem desperdiçada - aliada ao conjunto de atuações e a uma arrebatadora trilha sonora do compositor Hans Zimmer, que de forma inquietante e determinada naturalmente fluía entre cenas. A produção, de uma forma geral, também deve ser elogiada. É um projeto ambicioso e nota-se desde o guião aos inúmeros figurantes que tiveram pequenos, mas importantes, papéis. Afinal de contas, a história era sobre estes soldados e o desespero que sentiram.\n\nFilmes como este são marcos no cinema e têm extrema importância para a sociedade contemporânea. São uma lembrança de que as guerras são aterradoras e que o planeta não tem capacidade para sustentar uma grande guerra pós Segunda Guerra Mundial.\n\nDunkirk é terrivelmente belo. Nolan afasta-se das narrativas complexas para produzir uma autêntica bomba relógio prestes a explodir -  é barulhento, intenso e quase perturbamente imersivo, uma autêntica demonstração de perícia para juntar à sua notável filmografia.\n\n9,0/10",

This historical drama with similarities to \"The Longest Day,\" written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan is a harrowing survival story from the ground, sea, and air. Filmed in 70 mm by cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, Nolan conveys a vivid sense of hopelessness, \nfear, and confusion the soldiers feel in war. Fate and heroism are realistically depicted as random. There is a feeling of impending doom throughout aided by the use of a ticking clock on the soundtrack. Cross-cutting between the three fields of battle, our sense of time and comprehension of events is violated. Politics and military strategy are omitted. Despite the presence of strong actors like Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, and Tom Hardy, Nolan once again shows little interest in characterization so it becomes more difficult to emotionally engage with the story.

            "content": "Dunkirk is a tour de force of war, serving up satisfyingly intense and emotional resonance aided by a director in full command of his fleet and brought to life by a highly talented ensemble cast while honoring it's true story. As mentioned before, the cast is simply excellent all around. While there is a lack of dialogue for the most part within the film, the actors all bring their best to the film with an array of nuanced and grounded performances. Tom Hardy frequently steals the film as the pilot while Harry Styles delivers a surprisingly great performance as well. Its just a shame that the characters, as interesting as they are, aren't really given the time to flesh out due to the stacked number of cast members which can make it pretty hard to actually relate to any of them. The way Nolan tells the story is both innovative and a bold move. By telling the story of the evacuation through air, land and sea, he captures the scope of the ear effort and most surprisingly is how successfully he manages to run them all together so that its not jumbled up in a garbled mess. It's a harrowing tale of craft and survival that also explores the usual themes of war morality and ambiguity that boasts an endless selection of memorable moments, all while staying within its PG-13 rating, which actually works very well. The film's pacing clips by quickly, never letting go as the intensity ramps up and the stakes become all too clear as it grabs you in for the ride. Nolan's direction is amazing here, and honestly, it has never been better. With this film, he has crafted an epic in every sense of the word. There's the sweeping camera shots, the dynamic aerial sequences, and the feeling that Nolan manages to balance so many moving parts, being the dramatic story and the technical components so well. His direction is unique to the genre and somehow he manages to make the film feel as if it is beyond even us. Given the film's lack of development for its characters, somehow Dunkirk still manages to be a very intense and emotional ride. Most of the deeply moving sequences come at the most surprising moments, but not because they are manipulated, as many films do, but because of how well crafted they are. But it also retains a sense of hope that we can all survive this. Nolan's vision for the film shines through easily, and Dunkirk explores the themes of everyday heroism and beings forth inspirational messages. The visuals and cinematography are simply breathtaking and the intense musical score that echoes throughout the film elevates it all. Despite being a PG-13 war movie, Dunkirk satisfies like so few can. Its the best war film since Saving Private Ryan and will stay with you, whether you liked it or not for a long time.",

            "content": "With every movie theater showing trailers for Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk since about January of this year, to claim that this was one of the most anticipated movies of the year would be a huge understatement. But more importantly, was this film worth all the hype and has this director kept his rich vein of form going to produce a film worthy of it's hugely historical relevance? The answer thankfully is a most definite yes, as Nolan delivers quite simply one of the movies of the year.\nThis 107 minute feature deals with the evacuation of Allied troops from the French city of Dunkirk during World War II before Nazi forces could take hold and submerges it's audience in the harrowing events of the time.\nIn fact, Nolan engulfs his audience in this film to the point that those that suffering from motion sickness of any kind may occasionally find this an uncomfortable watch.\nHans Zimmers heart stomping score and Hoyte Van Hoytema's breathtaking cinematography also contribute to this powerful yet harrowing tale that grips the senses and emotions of it's audience and immerses them fully in this traumatic time in world history.\nThe exceptional cast (which include Tom Hardy, Kenneth Brannagh and Mark Rylance) also add to this feature, by letting their mannerisms and facial expressions take precedence over vast amounts of dialogue as the viewer is subjected first hand to the horrors and personal cost of war.\nComparisons to Saving Private Ryan are inevitable as both films deal with the terror of war in a unique and highly personal and engulfing fashion attacking the viewers senses in a violent and frighteningly realistic manner but in my opinion Dunkirk is an upgrade on Spielberg's 1998 feature.\nAn combination of superb storytelling, stunning visuals and a magnificent score in the hands of such a magnificent film maker who seems to improve with each feature he directs produces a near two hour edge of your seat thrill ride that will hold it's place quite comfortably on most cinema goers top five list of films seen in 2017.

            "content": "I gotta hand it to Christopher Nolan for continuing to make intelligent and provocative movies.  The first thing to consider with this flick, though, is that it isn't a \"war movie\" in the traditional sense, even though its subject matter concerns the military operation that took place in Dunkirk, France, during the Second World War, May 10, 1940.  Most war movies are linear, telling their story in a fairly straightforward manner.  They may involve heroism, carnage, things blowing up, but they normally progress from point A to point B in order to retell dramatically the events of the historic event.  They also generally follow a single protagonist (or a handful of characters) who inevitably survives the event.  This film, however, is using the vehicle of the historical event to explore the themes present in Nolan's general corpus of work so far; namely, the nature of time, the feeling of being trapped, memory, and heroism in the face of defeat.  To that end the film is a great success because it is reflecting on the response of individuals to an inexorable catastrophe.  In fact, the film struck me as Nolan's commentary on the terrorist attacks on New York in 2001.  Noticeably, the same elements from prior films such as water, mist, darkness, and nightmarish experience are present in Dunkirk, making the work another episode in the megafilm of dream experience which develops across the span of Nolan's other works.  \nSo what is Christopher Nolan trying to say in all these films?  Of the many themes, the most prominent seems to be that sense of being trapped; Memento's Leonard is trapped in his own head and faulty memory (and his girlfriend ends up trapped in a garbage bag), Batman's Bruce Wayne is trapped in the cycle of revenge and violence, the characters in Interstellar are trapped on a dying world.  In Dunkirk the historic material certainly confirms this sense of being trapped, but Nolan adds images of men being trapped in sinking ships, trapped in sinking airplanes, trapped in the dark hold of a vulnerable fishing boat whilst being shot at; he has long camera shots down alleyways, or through flagpoles that look like prison bars, or through the POV of fighter pilots; he has disorienting shots filmed from a camera strapped to the side of a plane in a dogfight, or terrifying shots of men burning in oily water, or nightmarish shots of men trying to clamber onto a lifeboat at night.  Even the Enemy, the German Panzergruppe von Kleist, remains dark and invisible until the very end of the film making them a terror out of the nightmare subconscious. Additionally, Hans Zimmer's use of the endless \"Shepherd's Tone\" illusion creates a rising tension and claustrophobia while the confusing shifts in time lay bare to the audience their own experience of being trapped in an inexorable linear progression, unable to escape from the events of their own time.  \nBut for Nolan there is no \"escape\", no cavalry, no happy land far far away to which we can flee from these prison walls.   Nolan's vision of salvation is far more mature.  He seems to suggest that salvation is not an escape from pain or suffering - but rather comes from the thousand little choices each character makes to give all they have in order to preserve human life.  The ending of the movie, echoing Churchill's famous speech embodies this stoic perseverance in the face of defeat: \"we shall never surrender... (we shall) carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.\"  Sometimes it is the job of the artist to remind his audience of truths they have forgotten.  The bending of time which occurs in the film seems to suggest that this perseverance is not new but has repeated in generation after generation; the perseverance of the Greeks against overwhelming Persia, the endurance of the Viennese against the siege of the Sultan, the persistence of the British regulars at Rorke's Drift.  Time and again there have been individuals in crisis situations who have panicked, despaired, exhibited cowardice or cruelty - but there have also been those individuals who, despite knowing they would fail, persisted in doing what they saw as right.  Individuals whose actions echoed Claude MacKay who said, \"Like men we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack, / Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!\" Individuals who though \"Made weak by time and fate, (were) strong in will / To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield\".  It is this amazing quality of our race that inspires others to similar action and it is this amazing quality that Christopher Nolan has so masterfully captured in this excellent film.",

I love my country, but we have made it this idea we won World War II by ourselves which isn't the case.\n\nThe movie has some pretty spots, taking the story of three groups that intertwine. The first group about British Spitfires (fighter planes) trying to give some cover, and engaging with German air force. Resulting in Tom Hardy having the only interesting action in the movie.\n\nThe second story about a small civilian ship as part of the armada of civilians coming to rescue the trapped soldiers and the story that unfolds when they pick up a soldier from a sunk ship.\n\nFinally the third story is about two soldiers trying to survive on the beach, and wait for the rescue coming from the civilian ships.\n\nIt was interesting that all three stories occurred over different period of time but ended together. The fighters story was within an hour, the ship within a few hours, and the soldiers within a couple of days. I think this could work in other movies, and I suspect this will spark a lot of copycats for that style. We will hate this just as much as other niche storytelling styles within a few years.\n\nThe problem is there is actually very little story. It is hard to see that because the story keeps jumping around, but when you step back the story itself lacks anything. I have seen documentaries on Dunkirk that had more story. I don't know if there was never a full story, or if maybe the story got lost when Nolan was trying to break it up to fight the weird timing, but either way it is pretty barren.\n\nI cared nothing about the soldiers at all, Nolan provided nothing for the audience to care about. Tom Hardy was interesting, but that was because of him, not because the story gave him anything. The only story I felt a little compelling was about the civilian ship, its crew of two teens and an older man and how they handle picking up a survivor. Even this story though was lacking on details and when you step back you wonder where the other half of the story went.\n\nI will admit the possibility that the hype was so big that my expectations may be too high. I was told huge action sequences, and I didn't see that. This isn't Saving Private Ryan, or The Battle of Britain even. It was fairly boring for me, and I can really like slow movies. The movie has a short run time, but I was still looking at the clock before it was over.\n\nThe good: It is an interesting way to tell a story, and it is nice to see a non-American based World War II movie.\n\nThe bad: The pacing was slow, very little action or story, and very overhyped.\n\nThis is a movie I would recommend if you are a die hard World War II fan, but even then wait until it hits Netflix.",

The WWII drama picks up with Great Britain being forced into the sea by the Nazis. With 400,000 combined forces of Britain, France and the Netherlands pushed to the beaches of Dunkirk, suffering strafing and bombing by the German Luftwaffe. Relentless artillery shelling and the advancing German ground assault. Kenneth Branagh as the British Beach Commander is faced with the seemingly impossible task of evacuating  400,000 troops with ships which can only carry 30,000. The story of the assembling of the greatest rag tag armada in history is the heart and soul of this epic war drama. Its told through the eyes of civilian sailors, selfless and brave soldiers, and understaffed and overmatched aviators, who somehow rise to the challenge, allowing the Allies to live on and fight another day to ultimately crush the 1,000 year Reich.",

            "content": "Dunkirk is a tour de force of war, serving up satisfyingly intense and emotional resonance aided by a director in full command of his fleet and brought to life by a highly talented ensemble cast while honoring it's true story. As mentioned before, the cast is simply  excellent all around. While there is a lack of dialogue for the most part within the film, the actors all bring their best to the film with an array of nuanced and grounded performances. Tom Hardy frequently steals the film as the pilot while Harry Styles delivers a surprisingly great performance as well. Its just a shame that the characters, as interesting as they are, aren't really given the time to flesh out due to the stacked number of cast members which can make it pretty hard to actually relate to any of them. The way Nolan tells the story is both innovative and a bold move. By telling the story of the evacuation through air, land and sea, he captures the scope of the ear effort and most surprisingly is how successfully he manages to run them all together so that its not jumbled up in a garbled mess. It's a harrowing tale of craft and survival that also explores the usual themes of war morality and ambiguity that boasts an endless selection of memorable moments, all while staying within its PG-13 rating, which actually works very well. The film's pacing clips by quickly, never letting go as the intensity ramps up and the stakes become all too clear as it grabs you in for the ride. Nolan's direction is amazing here, and honestly, it has never been better. With this film, he has crafted an epic in every sense of the word. There's the sweeping camera shots, the dynamic aerial sequences, and the feeling that Nolan manages to balance so many moving parts, being the dramatic story and the technical components so well. His direction is unique to the genre and somehow he manages to make the film feel as if it is beyond even us. Given the film's lack of development for its characters, somehow Dunkirk still manages to be a very intense and emotional ride. Most of the deeply moving sequences come at the most surprising moments, but not because they are manipulated, as many films do, but because of how well crafted they are. But it also retains a sense of hope that we can all survive this. Nolan's vision for the film shines through easily, and Dunkirk explores the themes of everyday heroism and  beings forth inspirational messages. The visuals and cinematography are simply breathtaking and the intense musical score that echoes throughout the film elevates it all. Despite being a PG-13 war movie, Dunkirk satisfies like so few can. Its the best war film since Saving Private Ryan and will stay with you, whether you liked it or not for a long time.\n\nFinal Verdict: 93 / 100",

Yes, this is a film that is worthy of all the accolades it is getting, and the type of film that Oscar LOVES to recognize. This is not only a fantastic war movie, but a fantastic movie, period. The film details the evacuation of British troops from the beaches of Dunkirk early in WWII, which can be described as a 'shitshow' at best. It's an incredible story that I cannot believe has never been brought to the big screen before. The film does an outstanding job of depicting what a calamity this was - these guys were fish in a barrel... then they got on boats and became more condensed fish in even smaller barrels. The horror and hopelessness of the situation is perfectly captured, as seen through the eyes of ordinary people living out (or not) an extraordinary situation. As war movies go, it's pretty unconventional: there is no main character, no consistent timeline, and very little dialogue. There is hardly any character development to speak of, something I normally heavily criticize film for, but it works in this movie - the main character is the event itself, and the movie only bothers itself with showing how it all went down. It's a simple narrative, told in a complex way. The film depicts the entire debacle primarily via the perspectives of three different people: a boots-on-the-ground soldier trying to avoid German bombs and get back home; an airman tasked with shooting down the planes dropping said bombs; and a civilian boatman determined to rescue as many men as possible. The three perspectives are interwoven throughout the film, using varying timelines that are not always clear and can be confusing, but all become focused into a single thread in the end. The acting is great across the board, but the standout is Mark Rylance as the boatman - he is a genius in his subtlety, I cannot even tell you how much I love this guy. And the direction is pitch perfect, featuring breathtaking visuals, innovative storytelling, and high tension that is sustained from beginning to end. This is writer/director Christopher Nolan at the top of his game. This movie is being heralded as one of the best war movies of all time, and while that's a bit of a tough sell, it's probably the best I've seen since \"Saving Private Ryan\".",

I knew everyone as \"that guy\" \"that guy\" \"Harry Styles\" \"that guy\" \"Tom Hardy\" \"that guy\" \"George\" and it got really confusing during tension scenes. Also, there is no reason for this to be a PG-13 movie. Explosions don't just kick up dirt and sand. It tears about limbs and sends them flying. Most war movies are able to capture this horror (like saving private Ryan) but, saying that I did have a horror vibe in scenes like the oil on the surface scenes and the air fights.\nOverall a great movie. Probably not for some (like people looking for a horrifying war movie or a movie with characters to care about)",

The lack of a score also adds to the intensity of the sounds of airplanes hurling at you and of bombs exploding around. The sound department deserves the greatest of laudations and hopefully they will get the recognition come Oscar season. All of these aspects make Dunkirk feel less like an epic war movie and more like a situational survivalist movie. This makes it an antiwar war movie",

            "content": "The topic of war brings a general complicated relationship for anyone due to its costly nature of semi-involuntary sacrifices in order to gain (noble) victory. For film, it's the filmmaker being challenged to authenticate the war-driven atmosphere onto the screen without glamourizing it, and the relationship gets based off on whether to see it on the big screen for scale or on the small screen due to the downsized interest. No matter the story with worthwhile value on a soldier or emotionally-imprinted areas, to garner mainstream audience to attend the big screen showing would probably depend on expected style in direction and level of performances, rather than indirect additions that comes from unrelated genres (ex: superhero).\n\nAfter \"The Dark Knight\" to \"Inception\" to \"Interstellar\", writer-director Christopher Nolan continues his well-known cinematic mastery in the fact-based territory for World War II in \"Dunkirk\". Like most or some war films, this one's unique in its own standing when not on the battlegrounds but away from it en route to home, with slimmed hope. The title speaks for the evacuation that took place on the shore of the titular French town with the Allied troops waiting for, and trying to find, a way to get further away from the Nazis' grasps. The narrative structure consists three stories that later intersects along the way in a nonlinear fashion such as: two young soldiers from the Mole are trying to find a stable sail without meeting continuous circumstances in a week's time; a father and two boys going on their own into the war to help out, till they get into conflict with a shell-shocked soldier they'd rescued, in a day's time; and a pilot fighting off Nazis jets on limited fuel while getting to France in an hour's time.\n\nThe nonlinear structure more or less proved effective when refreshing the immersive suspense through few different perspectives/angles that's really captivating and somewhat thrilling. It's also a narrative element that Nolan seems to go for as part of his excellent talent of turning something simple into something more complicated in a way of an equation to keep track of, which is apparently on occasions the main asset to go for. However, it also proved convoluting at the same time while trying to keep track, which is attempting to rearrange the narrative into something more linear in some parts. (Same goes to the general convolution of a war flick based on identifying characterization). That complication of the narrative quality was played around in one of Nolan's early, smaller films \"Memento\". So putting it simply, the simple element of the nonlinear structure that's convoluting whilst refreshing is like figuring out a complicated mathematical equation with an entertainment value.\n\nWhile making this film, Nolan wants to make it a different experience apart from the battleground equivalence \"Saving Private Ryan\". When I say that, I mean \"Dunkirk\" takes place away from the war mongering fields, and the cinematic techniques parallels, or replicates, to those mostly heard and seen by little almost 20 years ago from Steven Spielberg's own auteurship. Nolan's own spin from the director's chair and as a writer is typically masterful, and that adds into the war genre through his first take with the special effects, including the sound editing and steadily-rushed cinematography, being perfect from the recognized filmmaking that gets followed.\n\nSpeaking of recognized filmmaking under Nolan is the music being composed by his long-time collaborator Hans Zimmer. It tunes fittingly like the previous films the two worked together on with the composed notes being a reminiscence of what was expressed in those films based on the scale. One of Zimmer's greatest hits goes to the pleasantness of working under Nolan, with the tone resonating the basis dramatic approach that one runs on, then later escalates nicely around the climax till the concluding \"paragraph\".\n\nThe frequent word that appears as a way to describe Nolan's filmmaking is \"scale\" that increases in each film he makes, particularly \"The Dark Knight Rises\" having a mass count of extras, with the actors in front and center, in one setting. \"Dunkirk\" follows that in a synchronized formation within a range of frames from wide to small, and the massive human body (the acting) of the film still impresses that make it seems that Nolan can achieve without digitalizing the crowd. This brings up another elemental merit that's typical is the performances and stamina from the cast - half being well-known while the other half are fresh showcases. It's a usual vision in his films whereas the aura of the energy from the performances goes along with the dramatic approach, and the characters expresses the script well with probably cheesy one-liners that are backed-up with further meaning and emotion at the same time. Overall, the performances were very well done as always, especially when capturing the emotions of the harsh, violent reality inside a war.\n\nChristopher Nolan's latest masterpiece \"Dunkirk\" is genuinely one of the best war films, including one of his best by a slight decrease, and a nice cinematic experience for the genre that fits and nicely broadens the mainstream taste. To elaborate on that, it (personally) became an experimental proof from the spectatorship that auteurism can be a selling point for a film you probably wouldn't see often on the big screen, outside the story (i.e. \"Sully\"). It's great in its own way with a similar substance that requires from the genre that may be a little heavy as usual, but the epic art doesn't disappoint from the expected entertainment value. (A-)",

The feeling of desperation, fear, and panic is emphasized by the eerie sound track that seems to tick like a clock. You are constantly on the end of your seat hoping for these characters to make it out alive. The story fallows the real life events of the evacuation at Dunkirk where the Allied forces had to escape by sea out of France to England after the Battle of France. in While being the best movie I've see in a long time there are still a few flaws like how way the movie is structured. We fallow the perspective of three different groups, a soldier escaping France, a squad of English fighter planes, and a civilian fishing boat. Each story is told at the same time cutting between one another with all three connecting in the climax. While this doesn't would like a problem it  can get confusing seeing this for the first time as not all the stories take place in the same time span. For example the story fallowing the soldier on the ground escaping Dunkirk takes place over the span of a few days while the group in the planes takes place in just one hour. While helpful title cards help explain that in the beginning it was still hard to get used to it. The best part about this movie was how you never say the Germans at all throughout this film. You see a plane and a not very clear soldier who is out of focus. Making this choice really adds to the story. We don't need to see the face of the enemy to know whats going on. The characters are running away so stopping to show us what they are running away from takes us out of the emotions. If we say them we might have the feeling we could turn to fight them, or even render them into cartoonish villains like in Wonder Woman. We don't need to see the nazis to know they are bad, we don't even need to know they are nazis. I would really recommend this movie and you should defensively watch this on a nice sound system. You would be hurting the movie as a whole by watching this on you IPad speakers. SPOILERS: my only other flaw was with the ending. When they get home they feel disappointed in themselves. They ran away, they are cowards. But we quickly see that they are not seen as that at all back home. This seems cheep in a way. The whole movie is about emotion and how everyone deals with a stressful situation. At they very end they feel bad for losing but then its all okay because we get beer on a train with people cheering our names. No one contemplates their loses. The people they knew and didn't know who died yet the people back home don't fully understand that. We don't get a self reflection but a party. While there was some self reflection at the end with the blind man and the one soldier who learns about the kid there still could have been a stronger one after the train.",

Interstellar. Teknisellä tasolla mittakaava on yhä suuri mutta henkiltöasolla yksinkertainen tarina seviytymisestä ja epätoivosta. Muiden viime vuosien sotaelokuvien tapaisia raakuuksia ei olekuvassa ole mutta tilanteen epätoivoisuus tulee kyllä selväksi hahmojen kautta kun selviytymivietti saa heidät tekemään mitä vain päästäkseen kotiin. Pitkästä aikaa Nolan myös kertoo elokuvansa tarinan kuvien kautta eikä selittävän dialogin. Nolanen oma käsikirjoitus onkin tässä suhteessa reippaasti parempi mitä viime aikaiset lähinnä hänen veljensä kirjoittamat. Tarinassa ei ole kuin yksi juttu minkä muutaisin muta ei sen sentimentaalisuus yllä onneksi ihan Spielbergin leveleille. Näyttelijät hoitavat kukin ruutunsa mainiosti (jopa se One Directionin jannu). Hans Zimmerkin tekee varmaan parhaan musiikin vuosikausiin. Ainakin vähiten mahtipontinen! ***** /5",

            "content": "It's 1940 and WWII is raging. The Germans have forced thousands of French and British troops into the port city of Dunkirk, France, with nowhere left to run but the sea. The white cliffs of Dover are right across the Channel, so close and yet so far. The men queue up on the beaches hoping to be rescued, all the while being strafed by German warplanes. \n\n\"Dunkirk\" is told from three different vantage points. One story focuses on a young British soldier who's the sole survivor of his platoon and is trying his darndest to go home. The second is about British fighter pilots trying to shoot down German planes while avoiding getting shot down by the German fighter pilots. The third is about an old British guy sailing his yacht to Dunkirk to help rescue people along with his son and some other kid.\n\nThere's precious little dialog in this movie, especially in the fighter pilot scenes where there's little more than an occasional radio transmission asking how much fuel someone has left. Spoiler alert: not enough. I found these scenes to be really monotonous, sort of a cross between Snoopy pretending his doghouse is the Sopwith Camel and the Chicago Air Show.\n \nThe yacht story isn't all that interesting either, but at least there's a little more talking. Unfortunately, it's mostly along the lines of \"Look, Dad! Planes!\" \n\nThe story about the young soldier at least gives us someone to root for. The soldier (if he had a name, I never caught it) and the rest of his young cohorts spend most of the movie actively trying not to die as they frantically swim hither and yon trying to escape vessels that have been or are in the process of being bombed, torpedoed, or shot at.\n\nThe most popular way to almost die in Dunkirk is by almost drowning. There are at least three different scenes with men trapped under water trying desperately to escape. I am probably not alone here, but my fear of being trapped in a water-filled car is so strong that for years I carried a box-cutter in the glove compartment, lest I drive off a bridge and the car sinks before I can manage to push open the ragtop. Which is to say, my feelings about scenes of men trapped under water trying desperately to escape are definitely NOT the more the merrier.\n\nWhen not almost drowning, the most popular leisure-time activity is drinking cups of tea, which is often accompanied by open-faced jelly sandwiches served by smiling women. Tea and jelly sandwiches apparently help the men keep up their strength for their next near-death experience, which is always right around the corner.\n\nI'll admit that I'm not a huge fan of war movies to begin with, but some of them at least manage to tell a compelling story, rather than just blasting you with explosions and plane crashes and men leaping off sinking ships and thrashing thru flaming waters in search of a nice soothing cup of tea. I get that war is hell and the evacuation of Dunkirk was a real event, but that unnamed solder had to have been either the luckiest guy or the unluckiest guy alive for all of his narrow escapes.\n\nIf you're a fan of insistent soundtracks, special effects, and watching people hold their breath for a really long time, you'll probably enjoy this movie. As you might have guessed, it was not my cup of tea.",

The first story is about the 400,000 people on the beach of Dunkirk waiting to be picked up while the Germans are bombing the beach.  Need I say anything more. The second story that we find out about involves Mark Rylance ( who really is becoming one of my favorite actors to see in cinema) taking his two sons and a small boat to the beaches of Dunkirk to pick up people. Let me just say that towards the end of this movie you see a moment of pure joy involving several other boats coming to rescue people. The third story has Tom Hardy in a fighter jet shooting down German planes. One thing that I really enjoyed about the story is the fact that I did not know about it. Every movie about war that I had seen prior to this I knew some what about. The reason I am blown away by this movie is because there is so little dialogue. The story is told by human reaction, you can see the fear in everybody's eyes story is told by human reaction, you can see the fair in everybody's eyes as the bombs are dropping and the way the film is shot the audience is right in the middle of this war and it is terrifying. I'm sure some people will complain because it is about the Germans attacking the French and the British and Americans are not in this movie but I hope people realize that this movie is about the human spirit.",

La storia vera che fa da base al film viene raccontata con estrema precisione e riesce a coinvolgere una vasta gamma di pubblico, sia chi conosceva già la storia che quelli che invece non ne erano ancora a conoscenza. Sotto l'aspetto tecnico il film è incredibile: gli effetti sonori sono qualcosa di strepitoso, con un accurato lavoro di missaggio tra l'incredibile colonna sonora e i precisi effetti sonori, anche se è ancora presto sono sicuro che agli Oscar vincerà molti premi di questo tipo. Dall'altra parte il film riesce a stupire anche sotto l'aspetto emotivo, con personaggi ben caratterizzati e una sceneggiatura ridotta all'osso. Le scene di Nolan sono così perfette che anche senza l'uso di dialoghi riescono a trasudare ansia e tensione con molta facilità, facendoci provare una delle esperienze più intense dell'anno. Un'opera incredibile che però risente di qualche neo, come una fine troppo veloce e conveniente e una lieve confusione tra i personaggi, i quali ad un certo punto diventano irriconoscibili e difficili da distinguere. Nel complesso si tratta comunque di un film potente ed enorme, un lavoro inaudito di uno dei migliori registi contemporanei, uno di quelli che ha tutte le possibilità di diventare uno tra i migliori mai esistiti.",

It is an incredible achievement not in what it brings to the screen, but what it leaves out, making every element within each frame ever more impactful.  It doesn't rely on flashes and spectacles, but instead has the confidence to draw attention to the quiet moments, the minute details that captures the audience's attention ever deeper into the world on the silver screen.  It knows what it wants to show and nothing more.  Every shot is efficiently framed, and every moment strung together cohesively to form a compelling narrative that makes us not just see or hear what is going on, but actually feel them as if we were living those moments firsthand.  While a movie such as Saving Private Ryan's Omaha Beach scene unapologetically captured the realism and the frenetic pace of battle, with the foreground, middleground, and background all unfolding its own layer of pandemonium among other layers of pandemonium, Dunkirk's approach is a carefully choreographed chaos.  It doesn't rely on showing the carnage up close and personal, but you still feel it's happening and sense its effects and impacts on the human soul.  Also, character development is stripped down to only what is minimally essential, which is to say hardly at all, so as not to get in the way of the rest of the storytelling.  We know almost nothing of the characters' backgrounds, where they came from, nor their motivations in why they chose to be in the war.  The only common thread across all of the characters is simply the desire for survival, of themselves and of their fellow countrymen.  Their most elemental instinct for self-preservation connects the audience on a primal level that needs no further elaboration by the filmmaker.  \n\nChristopher Nolan's style of films typically have many moving parts that intricately fits together into a complex intertwining of story elements and plot points, oftentimes resembling a cinematic equivalence of a Rube Goldberg machine.  Sometimes this complexity misfires and the less than compelling outcome leaves the audience bewildered and feeling emotionally flat.  However, when it works, such as with Memento and The Dark Knight, it is an intellectual joyride that rivets the viewer and rewards them with an euphoric experience that resonates and stays with them well after the end credits.  In Dunkirk, we get three overlapping perspectives: the land on the beach where the allied forces are pinned by the German soldiers, the sea where civilian boats sail across the English channel to rescue these soldiers, and the air where three British Royal Air Force pilots lend aid to the rescue efforts.  Each perspective unfolds on its own timeline: the land over a week, the sea over a day, and the air over an hour.  While this method of storytelling may seem a bit confusing, it is by design and no less a trademark of the director, where he most notably used to great effect in his past works such as Inception and Interstellar which made the different rate at which time unfolds an integral and essential part of the story.  \n\nThere will be some who may not appreciate the slower pacing of Dunkirk and will feel let down by the movie.  Christopher Nolan crafts each film with great care and purpose, never repeating himself but pushing beyond the boundaries he had set for himself before.  This is a very different kind of film than he has done in the past, but it is still very much a Christopher Nolan film.  For those who can look beyond the expected flash and thrills of a typical summer blockbuster, Dunkirk can be as enjoyable and satisfying of an experience as any of the best movies that has come out this year.",

            "content": "An Actual Review\n\nYou know the more I keep telling people that i'm a writer, the more people ask me \"What have you written?\" Usually I just say reviews...as if It hasn't been 4 months since I last wrote one and it wasn't an anime which if anyone actually reads these reviews, has actually seen it. So yeah...lets review Dunkirk\n\nI think a lot of people have mistaken this movie, calling it a \"War\" movie, and yeah sure I think the largest war in history was mentioned there somewhere. In all seriousness this is nothing like the more recent War movies of late from \"Hacksaw Ridge\" to \"Fury\". Another movie which came out just before Dunkirk and is  closely related (and underrated) is the British comedy \"Their Finest\" which is another film I highly recommend. Christopher Nolan has always been a director of thriller and suspense, and that's exactly what this movie is. Its an extreme intense thriller, with 300,000 British soldiers who have all but one thing on their minds. Surviving. You feel the desperation, you feel the tension, never has a war movie before been shown like this. There is very little gore, very little action, and very little dialogue. It's enough to throw you off, that and Nolan's intuitive time structure of how the film is presented. The narrative of the film focusing on 3 different time periods at the same time with the men on the beach, the people coming to rescue those men, and the men trying to stop the Luftwaffe from killing those men. All narratives which essentially the film builds up to all come to the same spot and the same time. Yet as every bit as complex as his fascination with the weaving of time, Nolan is imaginative to know the audience is smart enough to keep up. And guess what, they are. Every bad review I've seen for this film has nothing to do with the cleverness of its narration, Nolan has made a blockbuster that unlike Michael Bay doesn't need Anthony Hopkins to explain it's plot for the sake of it. \nThe story is simple, these men are desperately trying to survive and that's it. Survival is clear throughout the film whether it be from the characters who hardly speak to Harry Styles who is willing to sacrifice others just so he can get home. His direction is clear (Yes that was a pun) and his presence in the film is just as important. Yes its strange having your main characters say almost nothing through the whole film, what I can't take is critics giving characters a hard time because they have no characterization. Then I just feel like they are missing the purposes, the characters are people, just normal people who don't need extra explanation and who don't have characterization because people don't have that in a day. These are simply men just trying to get home. \nWhen I watched the film, I had such a strange sense of patriotism when the little boats of Dunkirk made it, and the British Soldiers cheer just for the moment of the situation, and the characters get to sleep for the first time without listening to a BF 109. The little moments of this film are just as important as it's spectacle and make a strong testament for those who were actually at Dunkirk and just how important the Evacuation war. If the spectacle of this film on a 70mm Imax screen doesn't pull you in, then maybe the sensuous staccato (yet brilliantly used) score of Hans Zimmer who plays just as an important part in the film as any character. The ticking of a watch like time is closing in around you, practically never leaves the film and I still had it in my head even when the Tommy's make it home. Every sound to the rupture of gunfire breaking silence, or the slow build up of a Stuka's engine coming straight for you, plays the strange contrast to the sombreness of the film. There are a lot of moments of dead silence, the eeriness of just waiting for death is strangely more worrying than when a bomb is dropped from the sky.  Everything has its place, and you know just from the tone of the film when a scene is coming to it's climax. I'll just say for a film so silent, It's strange for it to be so loud.\n I've said something similar in my last review on \"A Silent Voice\", theirs a reason why certain things are made into films, it's a universal experience, it's meant to be heard and its meant to be seen, it's a strange language which I've really been seeing more and more of in my recent affiliation with anime. Nolan is often seen as practically cold with his style of film making, being wrapped up in the technical and visual aspect of it to the likings of Kubrick. Yet where as I feel distant with the overly spectacle Bullshit (I got this far without swearing) of Michael Bay and the coldness of Kubrick, I do not feel this with Nolan. Its more present here than ever how humane the film really is, and it owes that to the amazing visuals, the tension of sound and the simplicity of his characters. THAT IS WHAT MAKES DUNKIRK. If you made is this far, Dunkirk is not just one of the best war movies I've seen but shows just what a visual grandeur of a Blockbuster can do. Things I remember the most weren't how impressed I was that Nolan somehow fit an Imax camera inside the cockpit of Spitfire, but the look on Kennith Branagh's face when he see's the Little Ship of Dunkirk coming to save them.\n\nAs a very nerdy historian, I already knew a lot about Operation Dynamo and the Evacuation of Dunkirk, I never thought I would actually get to witness the story done justice. Granted it doesn't show everything, but then again it doesn't need to. Yet still I feel a bit of emptiness of how little part the French made in the film but their presence is clear just like it was in real life. The only reason the German Army didn't swarm the beach of Dunkirk was because the French were the one's holding the line. Yet the film by no means disgraces their sacrifices. It's a small gripe, but something I felt like I had to mention.",

The great event is seen through a cadre of oily, cowardly privates, their preternaturally British officers (who seem to come from another movie), heroic RAF guardian angels; and one (count 'em, ONE) of the civilian sailors who pulled off a miracle: Mark Rylance is so good in this role that it's almost a comprehensible choice, but not quite.\n\nThe movie's beautifully shot and amazingly edited to weave the stories together.  Hans Zimmer rightly  understands the film is a melodrama and appropriately overdoes the score.\n\nThe film is also inspired by Saving Private Ryan (the cowardly private is a touchstone in that film, too, though there it makes some dramatic sense); and by The Dark Knight Rises, where Tom Hardy is also put behind a mask and still manages to act brilliantly.",

            "content": "There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who love Christopher Nolan films and those who find them pretentious and tedious experiences. I'm in the former and found this film utterly brilliant. Set before the United States entered WWII, the film retells the the British defeat by the German Army at Dunkirk, where they were surrounded on all side by German forces, trapped along the shores of France and desperately trying to retreat back to England. The story unfolds almost wordlessly, following several individual stories amongst what must have been thousands of personal stories. One is of a group of infantrymen trying desperately to sneak ahead in line to get aboard a ship bound for England. Another follows one of the many civilian ships, crewed by a father and two sons, who risked all crossing the channel to bring their boys home.  Another thrilling storyline follows an airman who must protect English civilians and soldiers, while watching out for German planes, all the while also watching his dwindling fuel supply. The film is incredibly suspenseful and at times terrifying, which was a bit of a surprise considering the film's PG-13 rating, but that's a big tip-of-the-hat to writer/director Nolan talents behind the camera. What struck me most about this film was how it was able to fully capture the scope of this battle, but did so by telling the the story from three very individual experiences. Time will tell, but I believe this film will one day stand amongst the like of \"Paths of Glory,\" \"The Battle of Algiers,\" and the other greatest war films of all time.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan has outdone himself in this brilliantly ambitious story of the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of troops from the beaches of Dunkirk in May of 1940.  \nNolan tells the story by using three different timelines (a fact that seems to  have escaped the notice of some of the reviewers here).  The first timeline is called  \"The Mole\"  and starts a week before the climactic action.  (Or at least that's what is said - a careful tracking of the action suggests it might be more accurate to say it starts about 48 hours before the main climax.) The \"mole\" is the pier at Dunkirk being used by the British to evacuate troops.  The story follows an English soldier named Tommy, the sole survivor of his squad, who reaches the beach and connects with a French soldier who's taken the identity of Gibson, a dead English soldier.  We follow their progress as they make several attempts to escape the beach: first they grab the abandoned stretcher of an injured man and try to work their way onto a hospital ship.  They doesn't entirely work out, but other opportunities arise.\nThe second story line is called \"The Sea\", and follows a pleasure boat in Weymouth manned by a Mr. Dawson and his son, Peter.  It starts one day before the main action.  Their ship is commandeered by the Royal Navy to provide relief, so they load up some life preservers and set sail, joined at the last moment by a lad named George, who justifies his presence by insisting he can be of help.  \nThe third timeline is called \"The Air\".  It follows the paths of a group of three Spitfires, two of which are piloted by Farrier (Thomas Hardy) and Collins (Jack Lowden).  Their action starts one hour before the climax.\n\nThe interaction between the three timelines is well written, often with similar issues being faced by the diverse characters in their separate story lines.  For example, we see ships getting flooded simultaneously in the \"Mole\" and \"Sea\" story lines, even though one is happening the night before the action of the other.  The triple-paced story line is reminiscent of Nolan's \"Inception\", which also featured stories happening at multiple speeds.  (In this case we were spared the fourth story line of a vehicle taking an hour plus to fall off a bridge.)\n\nHowever, in Dunkirk, Nolan tweaks the pacing a bit, letting one story line race ahead and one straggle behind.\nMany events are seen first in the \"Air\" timeline, then in the \"Sea\" timeline, then finally in the \"Mole\" timeline.  This  first becomes evident when we see the Dawsons look up from their boat to see three Spitfires flying overhead - long after Hardy and his mates have flown past them to engage German fighters in their timeline.\n[Aside: honestly I'm baffled at any reviewer who didn't catch this basic structure of the film and instead criticizes Dunkirk for having continuity errors.]\n\nThe three timelines finally merge in the climax of the last 20 minutes, as Farrier's Spitfires fight off German planes while the Dawson's boat picks up survivors and Tommy and his mates try to finally get away from the beach.  \nI don't understand reviewers who complain about lack of tension.  I felt tension for nearly an hour straight.  I really don't understand reviewers who wanted more dialogue, or to \"get to know\" the characters.  The relative anonymity of the characters is part of the point here.  Hundreds of thousands of people were involved, and incredible acts of bravery were performed by generic every day people.  We don't need Mark Rylance to expound on end about what it means to be an English man sailing a pleasure craft into a war zone.  The awareness of the risk is conveyed by a glance, a tone of voice, and the way simple (yet not stupid) people interact with each other.  \nI hope Dunkirk gets respected by the awards show at the end of the year.  It's a travesty that Nolan's contributions to films like Memento, Inception, and The Dark Night have been underappreciated.  It's a shame that this might be  happening because viewers find the usage of varying timelines to be too confusing.  I am reminded of the criticism that Mozart used \"too many notes\".",

While it captures the intensity from three different perspectives, it lacks a strong cohesive story. Dunkirk is loud with muddled dialogue throughout. Instead of a bold narrative of French and British troops holding the Germans back as attempt after attempt for a military evacuation is thwarted or the amazing story of civilians swarming like mosquitoes heroically through the channel to bring their boys home to safety, or even the perspective of British airmen giving their all to protect the troops who were basically sitting ducks on the beach, we get snippets of the terror of the beach, a brave effort in the sky and one civilian boat becoming part of a war zone. There are great moments in each vignette, but the opportunity to tell the compelling historic story was lost in doing so. That's unfortunate. Personally, I would wait for the Blu-ray.",

However, I was pretty much glad when it finished. \nThe movie is just over an hour and a half long but the amount of dialogue in the film could be fitted into about twenty five minutes and it just deflates the whole thing. I felt really sorry for all the young actors who must have been over the moon to be cast in a huge budget film, only to have a few lines even though they have the most screen time. Harry Styles had the most and, to be fair, he was pretty dam good!! \nTom Hardy is brilliant, albeit, in such a simple role, but if you struggled listening to what he said in The Dark Knight Rises, you will have absolutely no chance hearing what he says in this! But he's just awesome in every role and is definitely the hero in the film at the end.\nEven though Dunkirk is not that far away from the South Coast at all, in one scene it cut from Dunkirk in the day, to Dover at night and it was the same group of people. In other words, Dover may as well be halfway round the world than just over the channel.\nSo a few bad things there. Some of the good things about the film were Tom Hardy's sheer experience and poise which shone through the screen; it was almost a relief when he came on screen! Harry Styles's performance which was surprisingly good, and the sound editing of the dive bombers as they bombed the beach which really made the heart pump. But aside from those three things, it was a huge disappointment",

Several other similar examples severely sap willing suspension of disbelief.

It succeeds at being visceral and dreading experience, showcasing the dread that people felt (and still feel) when they are on the line, despite being restricted to a PG-13 rating. And it succeeds as a Christopher Nolan film, with him being able to told a realistic scenario of the events that occurred during Dunkirk Operation while still using his trademark methods and style to approach the plot as a mathematical formula. It is a tight, concise, intense tale that relies purely on visuals as its main narrative. The idea of having three different perspectives being intertwined with each one to create an unstoppable tension is a great way of approaching a genre that hasn't left that much new to offer. The movie tells us when and where each perspective is happening through visceral imagery, giving us small hints of the movie's unusual structure. Dunkirk isn't about sentimentality. It is not about patriotism and politics. It even is not about heroism. It's a pure visceral experience that puts you along side those guys at Dunkirk and shows you the dread of being there. It's not poetic. It's not glorious. People are scared. People are pathetic. And it shows you that dread without shoving liters of CGI blood into your screen.?",

            "content": "Much like a majority of Christopher Nolan's body of work, Dunkirk is grossly overhyped and championed with too high esteem; although, this may very well be his best film since The Dark Knight, which is a pinnacle I don't believe he'll ever be able to reach no matter how hard he tries. However, Dunkirk is a welcomed change of pace, in that it doesn't clock in over 2 hours and contains very little dialogue, both of which are unusual attributes for a Nolan film. The lack of dialogue, aside from the obvious technical bravado, is one of the crowning features of the film, and serves a narrative purpose by conveying the soldiers' perspective, their shock and fatigue. After all, they are faced with a hopeless situation wherein they don't really have the words or energy to describe, and the silence captures that nicely.  \n\nIn typical Nolan fashion, he builds the narrative by intercutting between three primary timelines: land (beach), air (planes), and sea (boats). This gives way to some great moments of extreme tension because it allows Nolan many options to play with and cut between; however, some of these moments are so unoriginal and can be spotted, like the enemy aircrafts, from miles away. Take, for instance, the scene with one of the gun downed English pilots, which is obviously built up for him to be trapped within the sinking cockpit. \n\nThe cinematography is truly stunning, especially any instance or scene with the aircrafts -- those are truly perfect. The drag to this, though, is that the film contained only a handful of truly memorable moments, like opening with the raining pamphlets, or the soldier who gives up and wades out into the ocean. The film could've benefited from more moments like these to elevate itself, but instead leans too heavily on the technical effects and the historical aspect, more so than building a compelling story. \n\nI've also got to knock the film for using title cards at the beginning to queue us into the events, which we can basically ascertain in context through the scene with the raining pamphlets. It's this kind of handholding and coddling that will definitely alienate some viewers. The film is also full of some pretty silly, bordering on dumb, narrative moments, like Tom Hardy's plane flying for (what felt like) an extended period without fuel, the soldier who wakes on the dock to make it seem like he's been left behind (of course he wasn't), the fact that the soldiers salvation seems to appear miraculously out of thin air, and especially the kid who hops the civilian boat to go pick up the soldiers, who basically serves no narrative function whatsoever. The film's score (by Hans Zimmer) is also utter shit; it's like he's trying to do a Batman score over a period war drama, attempting to heighten moments of genuine tension with the cheapening effects of deep bass booms and percussive bangs. \n\nOn the whole, it's just an all right film and was met with such a lukewarm clap on opening night that it was almost laughable. It's just another instance of Nolan exploring the dark side of humanity with an overly populist eye. Mind you, Nolan once said in an interview that he only resorted to writing his own screenplays because a studio just doesn't hand you a script when you're starting out. While Dunkirk proves that Nolan's got a director's eye and technical savvy, it also may prove that he should maybe let someone else doing the writing from here on out. \n\nRating: 3.5 civilian boats outta 5. \n\nhttps://www.viddy-well.com/reviews/2017/7/26/dunkirk-falls-flat",

Maybe my expectations were too high after seeing all of the very positive reviews. I was lucky enough to see this on an IMAX screen and the look and feel of the film is superb. Shots of the RAF in full flight particular really stood out. However, I found the multiple concurrent stories difficult to follow at times although making events in a war confusing might well have been Nolan's intention. \nMy biggest gripe with Dunkirk is that I didn't get enough of a sense of the epic scale of the evacuation. For example 300,000 - 400,000 troops rescued by what felt to me like only a handful of civilian boats seemed understated to the extreme. The few allied boats that were there seemed to only serve the purpose of being blown to pieces although it has been explained to me that they were severely restricted. I particularly liked the RAF part of the story and especially how this chapter ended as it would have been very easy to go all Hollywood with this. I was also a fan of how it suggested that despite being allies with the French they were most definitely down the pecking order when it came to rescue with a deep seated suspicion clearly evident amongst the British.",

This added with solid performances from the actors and an impressive acting debut for Harry Styles, keeps the thrill-ball rolling throughout. Possibly one of Nolan's top 5 films.",

Evidently, I found this movie something that I can possibly learn from. Not to mention I was gobsmacked while I was absorbing the british tragic history in the 1st world war. It's not only because it was a brilliant and astonishing storyline but also because it was fully attracting.  Furthermore, this is quite sentimental in terms of characters and the backgrounds.

            "content": "Christopher Nolan's ode is a cutting-edge gem of technical art\n\nFilm will always be an unobstructed door for people whose desires to transport their attendees within scenes of hardship, resentment or exhilaration are more intense than their possibilities. Bit by bit, cinema, art in a collective pure state, has been refined by entities that innovate with inventive techniques enabled, either, by the prosperous technological advancement or the flourishing of intellect and imagination as a consequence of factors of the age. The cinematographic improvements cannot be confined to a single field, that would be a crazy idea, by virtue of this, one can say that the intervention of drama genre, in this ongoing construction, has been a key piece. Even though some time ago from \"Citizen Kane\" premiere (1941) a few works already instituted dogmas about making movies, was the magnanimous canon of Orson Welles that encouraged and exhibited the power the world of celluloid could have on significant parameters of the period. Then \"Casablanca\" (1942), \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946), \"12 Angry Men\" (1957) or \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), films rich in transformation messages and tales sustained in the darkest and most beautiful things that a human being can keep: love, rage, and forgiveness. Even when the genre is covered with titles in which prevail harassing relationships, the path to a dream or the overcoming of secular inconveniences; war, that heroic struggle, between two or more entities, that has forged history of the world, has attained its own category in the seventh art, movies focusing on deploying examinations about the origin, the development and the aftermaths generated by ignorance and discrepancies between two thoughts, two ideologies defending their arguments, verbatim, to the death, passing over the bloodshed of thousands of innocent men and women. This sub-genre has also delivered classics of brand-new attributes, with a perpetuity so solid that even, to this day, have an overwhelming cultural impact. \"Schindler's List\" by Spielberg, \"Apocalypse Now\" by Ford Coppola or \"A Bridge Too Far\" by Attenborough portray true realities, pillars of cinematography that gave rise to the creation of contemporary gems, such as the latest work of master Nolan: \"Dunkirk\", a film graved by fire on the world of war cinema.\n\n400,000 men have been cornered in enemy lands. It's 1940, violent winds ventilate the Second World War, exactly, the battles between Allied Forces and Nazi Germany. Operation Dynamo, aka the Miracle of Dunkirk was the defense and the colossal evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches and harbor of Dunkirk, in the north of France. Withstanding incessant fire concentrated on bomb artillery, thousands of people got to overcome this authentic Greek epic with the help of fishing boats and civilian vessels, which propitiated an official rescue. Occidental solidarity at the top.\n\nChristopher Nolan is one of the almost non-existent filmmakers who keep active excitement with every new release, in this way, three years after his last work, he raises a love letter to war cinema, a mega-production that highlights, in capital letters, an experience that gets by without dialogues, even episodically. Narratively, it's his film less cerebral and ambitious among a gold catalog led by \"Interstellar\" and \"Inception\", however, from the beginning, the story feels warm in its coldness, he assiduously introduces us into the heartless event. The given approach generates partiality in audience opinions since it poses a triplet of plots in parallel: German perspective from their air force planes, the point of view of the independent boat of a veteran and the journey of the main actors through the tragedy, a trio of soldiers who live their own hell. Without falling into subjectivities or appropriations - although director's grandfather was a British soldier who perished in those lands -, Nolan is set at the edge of situations injecting a tempo of the gods, specific dialogues in its effectiveness, and performances denoting professionalism. Being a learned man in the field of selection of tones and objectives for his psychological stories, his greatest strength lies in his form of making movies, here, Nolan displays a new record, one easier to keep pace: Narration in pictures.\n\nThe first scene is the best letter of presentation, which will serve as a pattern, for a film imparting intensity. The movie conjures up superlative landscapes, the opening sequence is the entrance of a superb artistic hypnosis, a display of magnificent frames strengthened by a majestic 70 mm and IMAX cameras, the colors and shadows explicit in pictures are which lead the story by far. Functional aerial shots from unsuspected angles, explosions, and gunshots piercing our senses, respectful and quasi-negligible digital effects that ratify the commitment to turn a movie ticket into an absolute visceral experience. Clearly, Nolan film would not be exempt from allegories and metaphors through images; the grayish scum brought by the strong tide is a synonym of human filth, the framing of the soldier taking off his attire and running to death on his own, portraying defeat and pride, the corpses that are buried by snorting wind, the endless lines of men in pursuit of \"salvation\", the palette of blues and greens from the scene where soldiers contemplate an imminent attack, the three men looking at nowhere, the corpses returning to the shore, the covenant between two men burying one innocent under rough sand or the perfect framings of Kenneth Branagh and Tom Hardy are dreamy compositions that speak through colors, shadows, lighting and setting, a master class of cinematography and photography. The seventh art didn't deliver as such adrenaline and justified action in a non-commercial film for a long time, an artistic and technical triumph. Get ready, because \"Dunkirk\" is going to transcend.\n\nHans Zimmer, a faithful Musketeer, returns recharged and ready to rise with well-deserved awards at the expense of his scores that not only include atmospheric obligations, these try to emulate stressful melody of a countdown, atomic effect of explosive artifacts, meteoric heartbeat or oxygen deficiency of the martyrs, a list of cadences endowing scenes with energy and tension like no other war film. Mr. Zimmer's wonders gain greater strength to the excellent work in the sound editing room, which accompanied by Shepard tone, are exciting. Gunshots are deafening, they are combined with the soundtrack, the crackling of the fire, the teeth chattering of a soldier, the cries of help under the water or the overflight over our heads provoke one of the most compelling cinematic experiences.\n\nI will never forget \"Dunkirk\", the movie that made me lose my record about seeing a film in IMAX cinemas, two words: mind-blowing and memorable.\n\nSome familiar faces go back, flaunting their high acting capacities. Hardy, Rylance and Murphy manage the cast purely masculine, understandable due to the context of the events. Each one offers spirit and personality to their characters to ease the following of the story. The performances of newcomers Fionn Whitehead, Jack Lowden and new soloist Harry Styles are laudable and rewarding in the skin of children with war uniforms. In fact, Whitehead and Styles make a powerful debut that places them on the radar of quality directors, also in a panorama of acting prestige.\n\nWhat would be the best words to describe \"Dunkirk\"? When the logo of Warner and Syncopy, bathed in a light blue, are unified with the war melodies, my feelings and sensations exploded of delight for the work of Christopher Nolan, creator of cinema with deep fundamentals and objectives. Brimming with complex and magnanimous technical components, intelligent and moving performances, a tremendous soundtrack and unmistakable and always welcome Nolan touch, \"Dunkirk\" becomes one of the best cinematographic experience so far this year, likewise, its function of entertaining for two hours with lights and pirouettes is relegated by the message of peace, unity and solidarity, three constituents not present in our anatomy. Did you think that one of the greatest war speeches in history - promulgated by the British politician Winston Churchill - recited by the protagonist was limited merely to the circumstance of the film?",

It's my 43rd review on Rotten Tomatoes, and the first five-star one. Now, that's not to say I haven't seen any five-star films, in fact my favorite movies I'd give five stars to: The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and Finding Nemo to name a few. But since I review movies that I see in theaters, by release date, this is the first time I have given five stars to a movie since I started reviewing in 2014. With that out of the way, I can safely say that Dunkirk is magnificent. Not only is it the best film of 2017, it is the best film that Christopher Nolan has ever made. The movie follows three plot lines: land, sea, and air that all merge into a thrilling finale. But in reality, the whole movie is thrilling. The acting is superb, the practical effects are exquisite, the IMAX visuals are incredible, the score is unnerving and the pacing is perfect. The film never relents, and is an incredible theatrical experience in IMAX, and without. I connected to the characters, even though I didn't know half their names because I was shown what they were going through. There has never been a similar structure like the one in this movie. Nolan has truly crafted a masterpiece. I am pleasantly surprised to say that Dunkirk is one of the best war movies ever made, and (so far) the best movie of 2017.",

From the technical standpoint, this is a masterfully made film with terrific action set-pieces, spectacular score by Hans Zimmer (one of his best), and immersive sound effects that put you right into the middle of chaos. Everything you see and hear are so meticulously crafted that you never question whether something was digitally added or practically made. But the fact that his films are so expertly done doesn't really surprise us. The important thing that you need to know is Nolan is a master of storytelling and with \"Dunkirk\", he uses all this technical wizardry to tell an important story of survival and hope. He cares about the story and characters as much as he cares about the craftsmanship; without the compelling story at heart, all these amazing technical achievements mean nothing. I found myself engaged in the story the moment I saw the first scene and I deeply cared about its characters despite the fact there was not a lot of character development. The moments of triumph made me cheer, the moments of spectacle were properly spectacular, and the moments of tragedy hit me emotionally.

While I'm glad to see the events of Dunkirk acknowledged worldwide with this blockbuster, I never felt attached to characters beyond man's inherent distaste to see people suffer. We never got to know the people whose perspective we follow, which isn't helped by Nolan's signature timeline tomfuckery. Long story short, its technical feats are mesmerizing and impressive, but there was next to no writing. This is especially egregious since he focused on fictional characters which had room to be fleshed out. I also found that having the only character shown to have PTSD/ shell shock to be guilty of killing a teenager falling down a set of stairs a wee bit demonising.

            "content": "It always strikes me that war cinema uses a common language to tell the story of battle.  Whether it's an art noveau European film on the 1956 Hungarian Uprising or an episode of Game of Thrones in which a Lannister army is burned alive along a roadside by goddamn dragons, much of what we see has come before and builds on that precedent.  It is imperative on the screenwriter and director to draw upon these archetypical experiences to create something new and original.  Christopher Nolan does just that in Dunkirk - an artistically crafted war film that relies upon the boundaries of suspense and tension to unfold the drama of the Dunkirk evacuation.   \n\nFor a bit of a context, Dunkirk takes place during the dark, early days of WWII when the German blitzkrieg rode triumphant.  In the Spring of 1940 the German Wehrmacht invaded France and the Low Countries.  Britain responded by sending an expeditionary force to help defend France, much as it had done in the previous World War.  However, the Germans brilliantly flanked around French defenses at the Maginot Line.  The Wehrmacht encircled and destroyed French armies in rapid succession.  The British were cut off, and decided the best option was to retreat across the English Channel.  While the bulk of German forces made for Paris, several divisions were sent to encircle and destroy the British trying to evacuate at Dunkirk.  Despite constant attacks from land, sea, and air, the British managed to evacuate several hundred thousand men with the help of hundreds of civilian boats and bring them home. The return of the British army helped deter any German invasion and would ultimately contribute to allied victory years later.  The episode reached near mythological status in British culture.\n\nSo leave it to one of the most obnoxiously English directors of all time to take on the task of retelling this story.  Nolan has much in common with Quentin Tarantino in that they are the last directors who can write, direct, and produce their own films and still be given a significant budget from studios and receive little interference during the creative process.  But more importantly, both Tarantino and Nolan make ample use of suspense and tension.  They stretch out the tension in a scene like a rubber band - it will be pulled as a far as it can go, until it snaps - and we are left with deadly consequences.  With this philosophy of screenwriting in mind, Dunkirk relies almost entirely on this device.  Set pieces last several minutes, feeling sometimes like hours, but your attention remains glued to the screen with baited breath - dreading and anticipating the result.    \n\nMuch of the first 30 to 45 minutes contains little to no dialogue as we are introduced to three different sets of characters on land, sea, and air.  We are shown but not told the dire situation.  Dunkirk feels no need to hold the audience's hand or cater to short, modern attention spans.  Heavy use of a minimalist, ambient score and smooth, but sharp cinematography and editing force the viewer to remain on the beach with stranded British infantrymen as they are strafed by Stuka dive bombers or as they attempt to board vulnerable transport ships and possibly drown in the attempt.  It is a perfect example of \"war as art\" and as strange as that phrase sounds to most people, it really shouldn't be.  American audiences are infamous for preferring straightforward, simple, and unpretentious war movies.  (See American Sniper, Lone Survivor, and Hacksaw Ridge.)  But I always preferred a bit of artistic flourish in my war films.  How can you protray armed aggression and not dwell on the emotion involved or drift toward the abstract?  There are limitations to that of course, but Dunkirk encompasses much of what I prefer in this genre.  There's not much to be said of performances as this is not a performance based movie.  The exception is Tom Hardy, as an RAF pilot who uses his Spitfire aircraft to absolutely wreck the Luftwaffe's shit, preventing them from bombing vulnerable transports during their crossing of the channel.  He delivers several of the wow moments of the film, and was my personal favorite element.  Though Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance give quotable moments that will stick with the viewer.  Dunkirk is reasonably accurate and does a fine job of telling a story that more Americans need to learn.  There are problems with the internal logic of the film regarding time and how some of the different stories come together, but in my opinion this is not a deal breaker.\n\nAll in all, Dunkirk is a beautiful masterpiece of a film and represents original filmmaking at its finest.  It was easily my favorite film of the summer and even if you don't end up agreeing, you have to admit that it's a unique experience.  Few attempt to reach as high and fewer actually succeed.",

Keep an eye for One Direction member Harry Styles, who plays one of the privates, along with Fionn Whitehead. (who is the guy in the movie poster) The cinematography is splendid and is what I feel is the highlight of the film, along with the script which shifts from perspective to perspective. Also worth praise is Hans Zimmer's score, which plays a main role of the movie (you'll also hear the ticking of Nolan's watch) as dialogue is limited in this film. Like \"Arrival\" before this, if you've come to expect an action movie, you'll be disappointed or bored, although there are indeed more war sequences in this film. If there's any issue with this movie, it's that there are a bit too many characters to keep up with. Go check this one out as it's one of the best films of the year so far.

O Nolan aqui consegue fazer uma coisa que nos outros filmes dele, ele parecia ter algum tipo de problema, que é o controle do que ele quer fazer, aqui parece que ele tem total controle de sua obra e sabe oque quer fazer. O diretor sempre teve esse trabalho mais \"pé no chão\", mais real, visando sempre mais, a realidade. As explosões aqui são reais, fumaças, tiros, os mortos! entre outros detalhes simples, e esse filme em especifico é o mais real que eu vi dele. A direção do filme em quesitos mais técnicos como a direção de arte, fotografia, geografia da câmera, parecem ter dado um enorme pulo de qualidade. O filme tem a sua fotografia linda e agoniante em algumas cenas. O CGI é muito bem feito e aplicado, (se é que teve, porque eu não percebi nenhum) os \"Chroma Keys\" também são indistinguíveis, o jeito que ele trabalha a luz na cena, da um ar mais natural e real. A segunda parte mais importante do filme é a sua trilha sonora, novamente junto com o Nolan o seu amigo compositor Hanz Zimer faz um trabalho em sua trilha sonora excepcional (O que já é de costume), Sons de tambores, ponteiros de relógios, entre outros são usados para dar um clima de agonia e urgência. O terceiro ponto do filme é o roteiro, escrito pelo o Nolan, ele se desenvolve bem, mas o problema mesmo está na construção dos personagens, você entende oque ele quer passar sobre os personagens, mas ele não passa. Assim o filme fica sem emoção e você não se importa com os personagens, você não se importa com oque você esta vendo, é lindo de se ver, e gostoso de se ouvir, só não é o suficiente para deixar os olhos lacrimejados de emoção.\nNota: 8.9",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, we just witnessed a brilliant cinematic depiction of war heroism at its finest.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Dunkirk is an amazing achievement for Christopher Nolan. Let s recap.\n\nSCOTT: We meet a young British soldier named Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) who narrowly escapes with his life while being shot at by German soldiers on the streets of Dunkirk. Tommy flees to the beach where thousands of British and French soldiers are waiting to be evacuated. He meets another soldier named Gibson who apparently has buried a friend on the beach. The two men encounter a wounded man and carry him to an evacuation ship. Meanwhile back in Britain, Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) and his sons Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) and George (Barry Keoghan) take their private boat through the English channel to help with the evacuation.\n\nGREG: We re treated to four points of view (POV): young soldier Tommy trying to escape, Mr. Dawson coming to the rescue, flying ace Farrier (Tom Hardy) guarding the shore, and Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) supervising the evacuation. It s a great structure that tells one of the lesser-known stories of WWII, at least for Americans.\n\nSCOTT: You re right, Greg. I was woefully ignorant of the story behind this heroic evacuation. Apparently Hitler made a huge mistake by not aggressively attacking the evacuees, and we can all be grateful for his blunder. Dunkirk is an extremely well-crafted film. It skillfully weaves together three stories about different characters whose lives converge at the end. This is a war movie and so there is plenty of death, but director Christopher Nolan wisely chooses not to make gore the star of this film. The star is valor, and it is on full display from minute-one until the closing credits. Nolan also makes great use of the  less is more  principle in filmmaking. There are long and excruciatingly tense scenes with little or no dialogue. The fear is palpable. But so is the heroic drive in these characters to act in spite of the fear.\n\nGREG: LIke many of our readers, I ve seen a lot of war movies. But I ve never watched a movie that made me feel the emotion of desperation that Dunkirk evokes. I never understood just how personal the war was. Britons of all ages felt that their way of life and their very lives were at stake. There are different levels of heroism in this film. There s the heroism of the young men just trying to survive long enough to get on a boat. Then there s the heroism of the commander overseeing the evacuation, then volunteering to stay behind to oversee the evacuation of the French. And we see the heroism of civilians going to sea to rescue the soldiers. And finally, the heroism of a pilot who lets his tanks run dry protecting the men trying to get away. He martyrs himself in the service of others.\n\nSCOTT: Joseph Campbell s hero s journey is only on partial display here, but in no way does this limitation detract from this film s excellence. Campbell discusses the low-point, the nadir of the hero s journey, as the  belly of the whale    the point in the journey when all appears to be lost for the hero and death seems imminent. Dunkirk is a film that shows in vivid detail what the belly of the whale is like for the hero, and it is hell indeed. This is the epicenter of the hero s transformation   either the hero musters up the courage and grit to thwart death, or the hero succumbs. Dunkirk shows us both these polar opposite outcomes. Young George is one of our heroes who dies in the process of saving British soldiers. In no way is he any less of a hero for dying; in fact, by making this ultimate sacrifice he solidifies his heroism to an extreme, thus illustrating that heroes need not complete the Campbellian journey to secure their status of hero. Tommy, our main hero, does survive the whale s belly. Will he become as  shell-shocked  as the soldier that Mr. Dawson rescued at sea? We don t know. But the post-heroic transformation toward PTSD is a tragic one that sadly afflicts millions of people.\n\nGREG: One of the things that this movie (and another the comes to mind, Warhorse) exemplifies is that not every compelling story is a Hero s Journey. Surely each of these POV characters is heroic. But the story structure doesn t follow the classic rise and fall we ve come to expect from our movies. There are elements of the Hero s Journey (Tommy returning to the ordinary world of England, eg). But the transformation of the hero or those around him is not necessary for a compelling story. This is one of those rare occasions where the enormity of the event is enough to move the viewer into an emotional state that makes the event memorable.  \n\nSCOTT: Dunkirk is a superb film that brilliantly captures the agonizing unacceptability of war. Yet it does so in a tasteful and aesthetically dexterous way. Christopher Nolan deserves Oscar consideration for weaving together three disparate stories of stellar heroism. I daresay that Dunkirk is one of the best films of 2017, showcasing the best of human virtue and valor. I have been torn between awarding 4 versus 5 Reels, but after some consideration, I m going with the full 5 Reels out of 5 here. The heroism, as we ve said, is unparalleled and hyper-inspirational. I was struck by the heroism of civilians who took action when it was not required of them as it was of the soldiers. Ordinary people like Mr. Dawson who step up to do the right thing are especially admirable and elevating. Most of the heroism on display here occurs during a tiny sliver of the hero s journey, the belly of the whale, and this is indeed where the heroic rubber meets the road. Director Christopher Nolan deserves huge kudos for portraying the whale s belly in riveting, exemplary fashion. The heroism here merits the full 5 Hero points out of 5. Regarding transformation, we are witness to instantaneous transformations  in the moment  of severe crisis, as when heroes must respond immediately to U-boat bombs pummeling ships and bullets piercing a boat s hull. These spontaneous transformative heroic acts are marvelous to behold. Much less marvelous is the post-heroic transformation toward PTSD that we witness from Mr. Dawson s first evacuee. We can t overlook the unsavory aftermath of an especially punishing hero s journey. Overall, I award this film 4 transformative Deltas out of 5. Movie: Transformation: Heroes:\n\nGREG: Few films have displayed heroism as well as Dunkirk. The story is told with amazing technical acuity. I didn t know the story of Dunkirk before entering the theater, but it is forever etched in my mind. The very purpose of storytelling is to share our values and history with each other - to deliver the messages of our past to those of the future. Dunkirk does this with surprising power. I give it a full 5 out of 5 Reels. Heroism comes in many forms. We re witness to heroism in great sacrifice (as in the case of the Spitfire pilot) down to small acts of kindness (as when the young man lies to the shell-shocked soldier as to the death of young George.) I give 5 out of 5 Heroes to Dunkirk. I don t think this movie was about transformation as much as it was about sacrifice. We do see some transformations - but they are incidental to the story. Everyone in the movie was already giving all they had to give. I would say that they all had already undergone their transformations to get to the point of desperation they experienced on the shores of Dunkirk. While I award only 3 out of 5 Deltas, it in no way diminishes the power of Nolan s work. Movie: Transformation: Heroes:",

Between the lack of character development, and the uneven, time switching perspectives this movie was hard to follow and hard to invest in.  Dunkirk has some interesting, moving scenes and historical info, but for the most part, it is slow and awkward. It took a while before I even realized that there were scenes being shown out of sequence. There is little done visually to inform you that a different perspective or flashback is happening. You'll see a plane looking down on a sinking boat and then a scene or two later you see people on shore boarding what looks like the same boat, and a few scenes later you realize you jumped back a few hours in time. I'm not sure why they chose to format the movie with all this time jumping when there was only a matter of hours between the flashback scenes, not days or years. It just made the film confusing. Your mind is so busy trying to work out the scene order and playing catch up, that you aren't concentrating fully on the details of the movie and you're not able to just enjoy it unfold. There are definitely a few standout actors, but because there are so many characters and very little character development, along with the weird formatting, most of the scenes have you struggling to figure out who is who, and which actors match with each story's flashback. Maybe if you read this before seeing the movie you'll go in more prepared and be able to follow the film better than I did. All in all, although it is worth a look, Dunkirk is not as awe-inspiring and impressive as other war movies, like Hacksaw Ridge, Saving Private Ryan, The Great Escape and Sergeant York, in My Humble Opinion. 8/2017",

The director missed that one. B) the beached trawler scene painfully revealed the directors ignorance of boats. It's a trawler with no trawling gear (nets, etc.), and although everyone in the boat is waiting for it to float off the beach so they can drive it to England, no one thinks to check the engine, fuel, batteries, all the things that make a motor boat go. Even the captain, when he returns to the boat, doesn't do any basic boat checks or other captaining activities. This stuff is fundamental to boats, so that entire scene was very painful to wait through. \n\nGreat film.",

            "content": "Dunkirk excelled visually and audibly. The cinematography was beautiful and the use of dark tones gave the movie a sombre wartime feel. Nolan captured some beautiful standout shots which were able to effectively convey the scale and devastation of the war (the sea of soldiers assembling on the beach, colossal docks being easily decimated by enemy aircraft). The camera angles used as soldiers struggled to escape boats that were filling with water added a sense of dread and tension. This was all augmented by the incredible sound mixing which lent an authentic wartime feel to the movie, particularly as it depicted the clunky mechanics of the military vehicles of that era. Dunkirk also benefitted from its beautiful score which brought the standout scenes to life.\n\nHowever, the story progression and pacing were ultimately the movie's downfall. The story was split into three separate segments (land, air and sea) and it was only when these converged that Dunkirk thrived. Unfortunately, as a result of the constant movement between these three segments, this moment arrived too late and was all too brief. Admittedly, the slow first hour/hour and a half was broken up with some action scenes but, despite being well-directed, these eventually felt wash, rinse, repeat (or board boat, boat capsizes, evacuate repeat). Furthermore, as opposed to romanticising the tale for the big screen, Nolan went for a true-to-life telling of the story which focussed on a more broad look at the army and civilian assistants. As a result, Dunkirk didn't invest specifically in characters which, with some civilian exceptions, deprived the audience of any tangible connections. The action that we do see thus feels a bit more anecdotal and less significant. This all made the already lengthy 2 hour runtime feel like an eternity.\n\n \n\nAll in all, if you're a history enthusiast or a purist who can overlook pacing and story issues to enjoy the more aesthetically pleasing aspects of a movie then it's definitely for you. However, the strong last half hour wasn't enough for me to overlook the struggle to stay attentive during its weak opening.",

            "content": "Tension builds, lives are at stake and excess is on full display with Christopher Nolan's 104 min big budget experimental film with 2017s Dunkirk-an experience that is cinematic in the purest sense but lacks that something special. On a superficial level Dunkirk tics many boxes. It is beautifully shot (by Nolan's new go-to cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, who previously shot 2014s Interstellar), the attention to detail is uncanny, the score from Hans Zimmer is predictably terrific (continuing his fruitful partnership with Nolan-their 7th collaboration together), the cast is amazing on paper (featuring Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance and Cillian Murphy) but the fabric that connects all these threads together-the story-is a dud of a torpedo, failing on impact. Although Christopher Nolan has shown he can successfully weave a compelling narrative on his own (with 2010s classic Inception and with his debut feature, 1998s Following), it is evident that the influence of his brother, Jonathon, is missing with this project (perhaps too busy with HBOs Westworld?) and it results in Dunkirk being too top-heavy on style, lacking any real substance after the initial shock and awe. With no characters to be able to relate to (and maybe that is the point-we shouldn't need a reason to care for their well-being) and with a pace that is so relentless, there is a point in the film where the entire weight of the experience begins to cave-in on itself and all that detail and accuracy that Nolan demands is exposed through an artificial story, unnecessary gimmicks (there are unorthodox time jumps that are very jarring) and convenient story telling that drag Dunkirk deep into a watery ocean rather than flying heights-marking it as disappointing effort from the influential director.",

            "content": "Dunkirk continues Christopher Nolan's winning streak with amazing cinematography, a sense of fear because of the horrors of war and tense action resulting in one of the best war films despite a surprisingly shorter runtime than a Nolanite would come to expect and occasionally convoluted storytelling. There are three stories at once, and while I didn't find them thoroughly complex, I still had a brief sense of confusion every now and then. Not as confusing as one of Nolan's previous films Inception but it can put off some people. There were a few moments where I nearly jumped out of my seat because of loud gunfire but I think that was Nolan's intention and, to add to the tension, the film attempts to avoid saying much and has Hans Zimmer's score leaving you saying \"Oh God, what's going to happen? Are the good guys going to die?\". Personally, my favourite story out of the three is the one where Mark Rylance and the two boys playing his sons rescue a shell-shocked Cillian Murphy. Seriously, I sympathized with how the soldier was left traumatized from what he'd been through so I understand his reluctance to go back to Dunkirk. Since I tend to prepare myself in advance before going to see a Christopher Nolan movie outside of The Dark Knight trilogy, I find myself to be immune to his mind-messing complex narrative so I enjoyed this movie and thus, the nonlinear narrative is utilized to great effect. I might watch it another time to truly embrace the stories it tells. In defense of the French not being represented since Nolan is British-American, I think he wanted to tell it more from the perspective of his people, so I think this is a bit of a personal effort from Nolan, his brother Jonathan and Christopher's wife Emma Thomas. It's not a terrible war movie - as a sort-of Nolanite, I admired the way Nolan crafted it - but whether or not you'll like the movie in regards to its nonlinear narrative, that's up to you.",

            "content": "The latest cinematic masterpiece from Nolan, both written and directed, it a surprisingly short film by Nolan's standards, with a running time of only 106mins. However, it certainly feels a lot longer than that. In fact, it's immense in every sense of the film. 70mm film, still being a strong advocate for film over digital (I'm very much the same) and this certainly proves that. \n\nIt's the first film Nolan's done that's based on historical events. The film being solely based around the evacuation of stranded British forces from Dunkirk, who were surrounded by the enclosing Nazi army. Operation Dynamo, the Miracle of Dunkirk, considered a military disaster, a crucial and pivotal moment of WWII that turned a tactical defeat into a moral victory echoing the pride of a great nation's people. The events that spurred one of Briton's greatest speeches from the then recently appointed Prime Minister, Churchill. \n\nWe get to see a viewpoint from land, sea and air, \nthree stories very cleverly woven together which keeps tensions high. It tells the story of a group of British troops just wanting to get home, a civilian boat going to assist in the evacuation and the RAF Spitfires trying to protected their fellow comrades below from the engaging Luftwaffe. All of this intertwine together that actually expresses an interesting balance of survival and heroics. \n\nThough it doesn't glorify war, and instead displays how horrifying war came be; but not in the disturbing sense. There's a subtle yet astonishing praise given to the men that both served and lost their lives during this disastrous battle. The film, though historical, actually questions the audience what you would do in such dire circumstances evoking understandings and compassion for each character. \n\nNolan went to town in doing his research for the film, quite literally which included a flight up in the Supermarine Spitfire and sailing across the Strait of Dover in a boat much like the civilian vessels did that day, taking him 19hrs to cross due to poor weather conditions. And it all paid off. The dogfights are some of the most intense and stunning aerial cinematography I've ever seen, having incredible perspective. \n\nI think, lucky for me, I had no idea who Harry Styles was, and I think that a compliment to his acting. It was only until after seeing the film when people started asking me how his performance was, when I realised he was from One Direction; this being his big screen debut, and what a film and crew to do it with. It was also Whitehead's big screen debut, and like all the performances of the film, I couldn't fault any of them. I'm not sure whether this was part of the plan but I do know there was purposefully casting of young and inexperienced actors to portray the young, unprepared and scared soldiers stranded on the beach. Either way, it worked and I don't think the impact would have been the same using big names for everyone. \n\nZimmer does an incredible score, and he seems to produce something wholly different yet strangely familiar when working with Nolan, this being their sixth collaboration out of the ten main features of Nolan. It's a partnership I really enjoy, placing Inception, Interstellar and the Dark Knight trilogy among my favourite scores. The building tension of both Inception and Interstellar are there but this time Zimmer uses a constant tick-tocking sound throughout; the sound actually recorded from one of Nolan's pocket watches. Though he wasn't alone in making the soundtrack and it's actually Benjamin Wallfisch's powerful, evoking variation of Elgar's masterpiece, Nimrod, that when hearing it, and even when listening to it now, it fills me with such incredible awe.\n\nTechnically, as a whole, it's a masterpiece; as a work of art, it's incredible. Beautifully captured whilst staying true to form, being able to convey the expanse of the sea, the distance they would need to travel home, the numerous and turbulent emotions among them, the want of survival. \n\nRunning Time: 10\nThe Cast: 9\nPerformance: 9\nDirection: 10\nStory: 10\nScript: 10\nCreativity: 10\nSoundtrack: 10\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for everything really. \n\n98% 10/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

Being a lover of the war genre and the history surrounding the whole thing, this was a must see! I expected a grand retelling of the 1958 Dunkirk movie starring John Mills. In all fairness, it all started well, panoramic views of the Dunkirk beaches, French soldiers dug in bravely awaiting the onslaught of the Nazi war machine.\nThough the expected historical storyline began to take a strange twist into three separate tales of survival that ultimately cross over into the finale. I wouldn't say it made things confusing, in all fairness it was a bit ground hog day-ish, but well scripted enough to not become dull. The three story lines consisted of RAF air battles, civilian boat en-route to evacuate troops and a group of troops marooned on the Dunkirk beach. Some moments of the film captured my heart, but even though he gave a good performance I struggled to see anything other than a boyband star in Harry Styles. On reflection it was a good well rounded, well told story, but it just failed to show the horrific, gritty struggle for survival that those people faced in those few dark days. Especially in a war zone where they were pushed back to the edge of Europe facing almost certain oblivion. Not everyone will agree that Dunkirk is no classic, but in years to come when people talk of Britain on the brink at Dunkirk, this movie will be long forgotten! \nA must see, but no historical masterpiece!",

Otro punto es que en ningún momento se les ve la cara a los nazis, para que? si lo hemos visto millones de veces y de esa forma crea más tensión al no verles las caras. También hay que destacar las interpretaciones de todos los actores de las tres historias, no se conocen, pero tan solo con las miradas se comunican entre ellos, hay momentos que parece una película muda y la química que hay entre los actores es alucinante, marcan una tensión sublime. Hasta Harry Styles hace un buen papel y como no el mejor es Tom Hardy con su avioneta.\n\nNos cuenta tres historias, una dura una semana, una un día y una de una hora, en la que poco a poco llega un punto en la que van cruzándose y de esa manera Nolan juega con el tiempo y con nuestras mentes como a él le gusta.

            "content": "A visual spectacle easily capable of masterfully immersing the viewer in the events of the fact-based story, that rapidly builds tension throughout. However, it seems the very nature of the picture restricts aspects of film making that could have otherwise been present, leaving you somewhat underwhelmed. Nevertheless, you'll certainly enjoy the film for what it is, but due to a lack of competent character building and bizarre editing choices, you don't consider this film as particularly memorable in comparison to others within the same genre. \n \nDunkirk is a story based on the real events of what took place in May 1940. This is presented to us through three chapters and locations, the first being the beach and docks where a larger majority of the film takes place, with the soldiers that are waiting to be evacuated. The second chapter takes place on the sea, of which the focal point is a small civilian ship and their journey to Dunkirk. The final chapter takes place in the air, and focuses on the RAF pilots, and is what I would consider the more compelling of the three.\n \nNolan uses a non-chronological timeline in order to tell these 3 chapters, by overlapping them, due to the fact that each chapter begins at a different stage of the overall timeline. While some have referred to this as a 'meaningless gimmick', I think this was an incredibly appropriate choice to make. Given that I personally feel one of the film's larger weaknesses was the lack of character depth and development, by allowing the viewer to immediately engage with each chapter's characters, does offer some kind of connection and understanding that you would not otherwise have if the timeline was chronological, and therefore making this one of the film's strengths as opposed to one of its weaknesses. \n \nBeginning with one of the main focuses of the film, which I'd see as the cinematography, given the fact that 70mm was chosen for the shooting of the film. This choice is certainly effective in visually communicating the scope of the event, and also contributes to the immersion I mentioned in the introduction of my review. The shots are amazing and only amplified by more of a reliance on practical effects than CGI. The colours in the film are capable of creating an interesting image, whilst emphasising the bleakness of the situation, and I felt it progressively got brighter as the protagonists progressed towards their safety. The reason I mention this is to further show how the imagery and visual style of the film are something worth watching for, and how there is an acute attention to detail which certainly indicates capable film making, which makes the issues within the film increasingly strange, something I'll cover in a moment. \n \nAnother strength of the film, is, of course, the tension. I had no reason to doubt that Hans Zimmer's score wouldn't be exceptional as usual, and I felt it had a crucial part to play in the intensity of the film. In this aspect, the slightly lacking depth of character works in the film's favour, since I had no expectation for the 'main' characters to make it to the end of the film, and that really raises the steaks. However, in this positive, also lies one of my gripes with the film. While the sound design in the film is also to a high standard and does an excellent job of engaging you in the film's setting, on occasion it is immensely loud, most notably in the more intense scenes. Now while you'd expect this to contribute to the build of tension because I understood, that much like the soldiers we're experiencing this with, we are meant to be surprised by the next shot or explosion, for me it did the opposite. There is one scene you'll notice this in particular, but keeping it vague, I will state that shots are being fired that potentially jeopardize the safety of a group of soldiers. As time passes, the danger, and intensity increases. However, this film really takes you out of the moment since instead of feeling this fear for the soldiers, I'm more concerned about when I'm going to be deafened by a shot ringing out. You end up with this disconnection from the film because I'm not worried about the soldiers, I'm worried about the 'jump-scare' method being used as a crutch for building tension. Later on in the film, particularly towards the very last scenes of the film, the intensity is there without a reliance on cheaply making gunfire or explosions loud, and it's immeasurably more effective, and for me it went to prove how much I loved the last act of the film in comparison to the rest, as I'm sure you will too. I understand how in the events of the film, yes explosions, bullets, it would be loud, and it's supposed to bring us further into this harsh reality, but I feel it could have been done in a more effective fashion. \n \nSince I keep mentioning it, I'll stop beating around the bush, and talk about one of the biggest issues with the film, and that is simply the characters. They are unmemorable, lackluster and with so much potential for more, and I would say that is down to an undeniable lack of dialogue. You really only see proper interaction in the chapters for the sea, and the air, which is disappointing this the film really revolves around the soldiers on the beach. There are eerie silences that don't contribute anything to the film, it's simply meaningless and frankly strange. Characters will go extended periods of time completing actions without actually communicating as if they have some kind of supernatural bond. I would give the film credit if these soldiers had come to know and understand each other after fighting in the same war, resulting in an actual bond, but we receive confirmation that isn't the case. Even a modicum more of dialogue would have worked wonders on this film, and really allowed us to engage with the characters on screen. Now, I mentioned before that the \"nature of the film\" could prevent it from doing so, since Dunkirk is really a telling of a story for all the soldiers, but throughout the film, we stick with particular characters, therefore they are obviously focused in the film. Without any information, they are completely forgettable, and therefore makes this film similarly unmemorable. For me, it is the characters that need to be of a high standard, to make the film a standout, and Dunkirk doesn't have that. If we could just understand these characters motivations, I feel there would be so much more to be gained, and we could really root for the characters portrayed. That being said, the acting in the film is good enough. Nothing too revolutionary, nor disappointing, although, to my surprise, Harry Style's performance was surprisingly good, and wasn't noticably out of place whatsoever. \n \nTo conclude, Dunkirk is in many ways, a great feat of film making, and in others, underwhelming. I feel the focus of the film was too visually rooted, as opposed to spreading the focus and making a complete package. Once again I will say that Dunkirk is worth a watch, but a second? Probably not.",

This immersive, visceral ride exposes viewers to the harsh, base reality of surviving a world war. I loved how Nolan touched on so many different moral dilemmas. Never judging, just immersing you in the moral quagmire of the need to survive. When a character is found burying another solider, we see a bare foot and then the character lacing up a boot. Is this wrong? Nolan, as always, trusts the audience to make up their own mind. This is a cinematic experience not to be missed. Hans Zimmer's score is superbly taught, ratcheting the tension up gradually, without ever going over the top. The Spitfire scenes alone are worth watching, not to mention Kenneth Brannagh's stoic, inspirational performance. We don't get to know the characters because, during war, there isn't time to swap a back story.",

Typical war movies are about character growth through hardship. Dunkirk has very little dialogue and is not about character growth (in fact, I don't remember hearing some of the characters' names in the movie) because Nolan immerses the audience into the experience of the Dunkirk evacuation, which was hurried and intense and thus likely allowed very little for conversations among the soldiers. This lack of focus on character growth in the movie is what makes Dunkirk unique and it opens up avenues for other thematic explorations, such as themes surrounding national unity. Like any Christopher Nolan film, the cast and the score by Hans Zimmer are spectacular. I'm not sure Dunkirk is the best war film ever made, but it's sure damn great and unique. I hope to see Dunkirk join the likes of other war movies such as The Deer Hunter, Patton, and Platoon at the Academy Awards! If not, it'll definitely be in the class of Doctor Zhivago, Apocalypse Now, and Saving Private Ryan. I'll be buying the DVD as well as the soundtrack-take all my money (okay, maybe not all of it)!",

            "content": "In the spring of 1940, on a French beach called Dunkirk, our civilization was on the brink of collapsing. More that 300,000 Brits, French, Belgians, Dutch, and Polish soldiers were pinned down by the Nazis. By the end of this battle more than 100,000 Allies were killed, wounded or captured. On that long curved strip of sand, time was literally running out on the Allies because of bad luck, military missteps and muddled governmental decisions. But the movie \"Dunkirk\" wouldn't enlighten you about any of this. The superbly imaginative director Christopher Nolan could have shaped this story into one hell of a epic, amplifying how the indifferent, yet unrelenting relativity of time will press itself upon a real event. He had accomplished this before, in stunning fictional films like Memento and Inception. Instead, he ignores his unique worldview and fails to deliver a victory. How did this talented filmmaker get it so wrong? First, he simplified the structure of the film by restricting the action to the fates and decisions of a soldier, an airman, and a rescuer. He then denied these persons either a compelling back story or a back story at all. Finally, he didn't differentiate their traits in a way to reflect his view of human behavior, how people make use of the time they have, how they create tension by either stretching out the action or speeding it up. These characters are so thinly drawn, they can't but undercut the dramatic use of time. As a result, scenes of conflict and terror lack deep tension and energy. These scenes include the ups and downs and twists and turns of troops surviving on Dunkirk Beach while waiting for rescue. Unlike Inception, there is no analogous top spinning on the verge of staying erect or falling down. Nevertheless, Christopher Nolan has gathered over his previous films so much good will, so much credibility, I didn't want to give up hope that \"Dunkirk\" would pull off a few cinematic magic tricks and begin to soar. Those moments never arrived, moments that would have relieved us from the film's relentless myopia and linearity, from its flattening of the dynamic of time, from its stifling any sparks of energy, and from its monotonous, pummeling soundtrack. The director and screenwriter's biggest artistic mistake was assuming that the movie could succeed by centering solely on the micro-heroics of characters portraying gallant emotions. The moral victory of Dunkirk, the rescue of more than 300,000 Allies, was a vastly more complicated miracle. It succeeded despite bad luck and gaffes, poor military planning and the political actions of the Allies and Germans. In ignoring those complexities or only superficially alluding to them, Mr. Nolan misses the opportunity to thrill us, and moreover, to inspire us. Those complexities contributed in real life to dramatic urgency, making the free world feel like its time was running out. I wanted to feel that urgency, to experience being stranded, to feel deeply for characters, and to wonder what I would do if I were there. Instead I found myself stranded on a cinematic beach, squirming in my seat out of boredom, instead of experiencing the agony of being suspended in time and worrying if those soldiers fighting for freedom and against evil would survive.",

When it comes to directing, Christopher Nolan is technically flawless. He has garnered such a prestige (see what I did there) that audiences go to see his films because it has his name on it. I can only think of a handful of directors that have that power over people. When it comes to war movies, it could be full of story (Full Metal Jacket), full of action (Black Hawk Down) or the perfect balance of both (Saving Private Ryan). Dunkirk falls in the action category but interestingly this does boast some drama and tension that elevates the experience entirely. Three narratives that follow different time frames of the evacuation and coincidentally are three types of transport: land, sea and air. An ensemble cast of British talent including the conversion of Harry Styles from pop star to a decent actor. Cillian Murphy...'Nuff said. Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy and Kenneth Branagh were all dependable as well. Nolan has once again taken on a genre and owned it. His directing style is impeccable. The spitfire dog fights were so well filmed, and even the underwater scenes, whilst manic, were clear and damn terrifying. This isn't your typical Hollywood war film where we get back stories of our characters. You are literally strapped in, mid evacuation and experiencing the sheer devastation at maximum velocity...I really admire that approach. Some may not like it, which is fine. I mean a little bit more characterisation wouldn't hurt but I was gripped from start to end. The stand out though...is Hans Zimmer. That musical score was absolutely genius. That. Damn. Ticking. Completely unnerving...and it continues throughout the tight runtime. Goes to show that a score can enhance a film from good to great. I had some issues with the sound editing, particular the dialogue...too much mumbling rather than cohesive words. Dunkirk is close to perfection, maybe after another viewing perhaps?",

            "content": "I think of my self as a fairly competent individual. I'm no Einstein, but I am fairly well educated . And so it is that now and then, I stumble upon something that makes me question my own intelligence. The Generally High Star Reviews for this movie being one one them. Either I am not nearly as smart as I think I am, or the vast majority of reviewers have gone completely off the rails. I Just don't know what to make of it all. But it goes without saying that in my opinion, the 4-5 star reviews for this movie are unwarranted. \n\nFirst things first. The musical score. From start to finish, the music is obnoxiously loud, irritating and grating. I would go as far as to say, it was literally stressful. I wanted to leave about mid way through the movie, but I stuck it out because I was at a movie tavern and I had food coming. At one point, I audibly said out loud for all to hear, \"Oh COME ON ALREADY\". But nobody did here me. The music is incessant, it never lets up. It goes from too loud to \"OMG MY EARS\" loud, up and down and up and down. It's enough to make one feel sea sick. This is how loud the sound tract was. It made what I can only imagine is an otherwise quality sound system, sound as though a 16 year old bungee corded a 12\" sub woofer into a 5 gallon bucket, and set it in side the trunk of a 1970's Chevelle. You remember in Dumb and Dumber when Ace says; \"You wanna here the most annoying sound in the world\"? On reflection, a plausible explanation for this may be that Nolan wanted the audience to feel utter hopelessness and to be as miserable as the men must surely have been in that hellish place, to feel their soul shattering despair. If this is the case, SCORE 1 for the movie. But this does not make for an enjoyable movie going experience. I don't think HATE is a strong enough word for what I feel for this movie. The music alone is quite enough to ruin the movie, but it doesn't stop there. \n\nThis was not so much a \"Story\", as it was a montage of experiences through the eyes of virtually nameless faceless people. The \"Characters\", if you can call them that, are little more than a means to an end, to deliver the general feeling of despair that must have been the defining  experience for all involved. To the extent that there is dialog, it is not for the purpose of telling a story, as indeed there is no story. It's simply banter in most cases. Banter to tell the audience facts meant to underpin the Disrepair of the people talking. \n\nThis movie feels like a first time movie makers art film, that they got lucky enough to show at a Sundance film festival.  That's not to say that there are no really good Sundance films. It's just that this is not one of them. It's one of the bad ones. \n\nI would also like to touch on the Time jumping from perspective to perspective. Why? I Sincerely don't understand. Depicting these series of events  from multiple perspectives on different time scales and arches, only servers to confuse people. I was 90% of the way through the movie before I understood what the hell was happening. I had one of those \"A HA!\" moments. \"That's what he's doing\". Followed immediately by; \"Why the hell is he doing this\"? \n\nI love a good war flick, especially ones where I learn something about history, even if the story is embellished. Band of brothers THIS IS NOT. And although I am not a scholar on Dunkirk, there are MANY eyebrow raising moments in this \"Movie\", where I was like,,,, \"hmmmm,,, I don't think so\". Attention to details was not this movies strong suite. \n\nWas it visually pleasing? Many people seem to think so. Again, I am left questioning my own sanity. Visually appealing? I mean, it wasn't gawd awful, but it was far from a tour de force. Do people know what 400,000 men actually looks like? I realize that you can't have 400,000 extras, but CGI that stuff in or SOMETHING. There were numerous \"Modern\" features in the background. There was a major disconnect between the distance at which the Germans supposedly had closed in on the beach, and the sounds of war. The whole thing felt almost \"Dream Like\" if you know what I mean. That's right actually. this whole movie feels like someones dream, someone who was never involved in the events at Dunkirk, but had read something about it in a newspaper archive somewhere. Visually speaking, it was boiler plate. Honestly I just don't understand the accolades surrounding the \"Visual\" aspects of the movie. The best I can say is that it didn't make my eyes bleed. Congrats I guess? Job well done? You succeed in not making it look as bad as it sounded? But at the same time, somehow not making it look as bad as the actual event must have been. \n\nI want to say one more thing about the sound effects in this movie as well. The German Stuka dive bombers I am told were absolutely terrifying when they went into their dives. If you want JARRING sound effects, than try using them sparingly and for the right reasons. The Dive bombers would have been a good choice for jarring sound effects. But this movie has JARRING sound effects peppered all throughout the movie. The effect is that they incredibly annoying, tedious and it ruins every spot where a jarring sound effect might otherwise  have been a good thing. And then there are the sound effects used for \"JUMP SCARES\". Imagine if a friend of yours snuck up behind you and screamed at the top of their lungs an inch from your ear. MAYBE, after you cleaned the pee up, you might congratulate your friend on a job well done. \"Wow buddy, you REALLY got me,,, good job\". Or more likely, you simply would not talk to that person again for days, while you decide if you should stop being friends with them altogether. Now, imagine this happening several times in the same day. The second time around you would knock some teeth out of your \"Friends\" stupid face. This movie does this on WAY TOO MANY OCCASIONS. We GET IT ALREADY!!!. WAR IS SCARY AND UNPREDICTABLE AND IT CAN JUMP OUT AND GET YOU AT ANY MOMENT. HEARD YA!. But you know what the WORST part of these jump scares is? It's the fact that there is absolutely no pay off. I didn't give a damn about any of these paper thin \"Characters\" in this movie. If anything, the jump scares only made me resent them more. It's like, I hate you people for being so FLAT and UNLIKABLE, and yet I am forced to sit here and endure these incredibly jarring, loud as hell noises that randomly pop out of freaking nowhere for no good reason other than to say \"GOTCHA\". All PAIN, no PAYOFF.  \n\nSo what is the viewer left with? This movie was devoid of a story, devoid of any characters that you could remotely care about, full of I believe, historical inaccuracies, it had a sound tract that was physically stressful and literally made me want to leave the theater, and the frequency of the unnecessarily loud and jarring sound effects drowned out the few opportunities where great sound effects could have been used. This was a GAWD AWFUL MOVIE. It has no redeeming qualities, or at least, no redeeming qualities that make it stand out from any other movie. And I am at a loss to understand where the vast majority of 4 and 5 star reviews are coming from.",

I had heard somewhere that this movie was going to be the \"Saving Private Ryan\" of my generation, which most likely gave me too high of expectations going into film.\nThe action scenes all looked great - whether it was the beach getting strafed by an airplane, boats getting torpedoed, or airplane v airplane dogfights. \nHowever, as the action scenes were cool, there was just as much film where everyone was just sitting around waiting. I understand that is what happened at the actual city of Dunkirk during the war and that the director wanted to accurately portray that. But as a consumer there's only so many minutes of men standing around that I can tolerate. \nMy least favorite part of the movie was how Christopher Nolan decided to have the \"time jumping\" around between the three, concurrent plot lines (classic Nolan, am I right?) Luckily my friends dad has scene the movie before me and gave us a heads up to how it was organized, which allowed me to be prepared for this style of presentation. The use of this style of film making always keeps you asking questions during the film (\"Didn't this happen already?\" \"Is that the same boat the other guys were on earlier?\"), and by the end of the film it all makes sense. However I think that this aproach took a little something away from the movie that was otherwise good - and for me that was the difference between 3 and 4 stars.",

He deals with surreal environments where his characters are in a microcosm. Inception is ingenious, and works on many levels. The Prestige, Insomnia, and Interstellar are all brilliant. That's why I'm so confused at how he can drop to this fractured storytelling that does not innovate or bring much of a fresh perspective. It's an art film that leaves out many aspects of War to focus on the unexpected heroes, and the whole pointless, juxtapositions of survival. He tells three intersecting storyline to show some people trying to get on a ship while other are trying to escape a ship, sometimes the same people realize that survival is the contrary . Some anticipate a plane for saving, others fear the sound of plane that comes for attack. Some are selfish for survival, while others want to save everyone else and are willing to sacrifice what they hold dearest. It's a bit dizzying going up and down in water, flying around chasing each others tail.\nThe Battle of Dunkirk is reduced to a psychological study of alternating goals that may or may not lead to survival. In the end private boat owners are the heroes, and the survivors are just a humble statistic. The musical score was constant and got unnerving, mostly on purpose. The 1940s British accents were often unintelligible with all the noise and music. \n\n Another war is pointless movie like this wasted Nolan's talent. This could have been done by some other director that was getting their start. I watched it in 70mm which was pointless, Nolan made no attempt to glorify anything on display, so the drabness was in full effect. I can't believe this followed the visually rich Interstellar.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan. The guy with whom you can associate any genre; be it superhero films (The Dark Knight Trilogy), science fiction (Interstellar), thrillers (Inception, The Prestige) or a revenge story (Memento). This man never fails to impress us no matter what he's getting his hands on to. Dunkirk is an excellent piece of work and an excellent example of what I just said, if not the best war film ever made (like Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List). But is it the best film with a backdrop of the Second World War crafted with ingenuity and drips art in a truly refined manner qualifying as a masterpiece of the modern age of cinema? Possibly yes.\n\nNot to be compared with the likes of Birdman, Dunkirk is that kind of a movie the advent of which brings something new, while following into the footsteps of old-fashioned artistry. Dunkirk is triptych. For those of you who don't know what triptych means, triptych is a form of art divided into three sections representing a single piece of work. And now for those of you who just went to watch the film because it's the movie made by the same guy who made The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar, you might have missed out the minute details that make this film worthy of an Oscar run and also might not have liked the film much. Not everybody's cup of tea.\n\n*Minor spoilers ahead*\nThe second sequence of the film very much tells us about the triptych style of the movie. When Fionn Whitehead makes it to the beach after his comrades are gunned down by the enemy, we see there is a shot with two poles standing a few feet apart from each other dividing the screen into three sections. The movie is divided in three different temporal lines (not varying by much though) and all the storylines converge at the end of the film. Again, when Fionn Whitehead and Aneurin Barnard are trying to get one of the wounded soldiers aboard the ship and scurrying along the beach, we see again the screen being divided into three equal panels. And there are a few more junctures where the film is vocal about its triptych style.\n\n*spoilers end*\n\nApart from that, Dunkirk is a war film without any gore. The hell with gore, you don't even get to see much blood. But still it races your heart. Still it brings you to the edge of your seat. Still it swells emotions. And still it reminds us how harrowing war can be. Talking about the triptych style of the film, with the trio of Christopher Nolan, Hoyte van Hoytema and Hans Zimmer working on the three most crucial parts of any film (direction, cinematography and background score respectively), nothing can possibly go wrong. We all have seen earlier what happens when the three of them collaborated in the epic space venture Interstellar, and tell me if I'm wrong when I say that they have maintained their standards and raised them for everybody else.\n\nPersonally, I feel Hans Zimmer's score in Interstellar was better because at points I got teary-eyed but the metronomic beats and the suspenseful soundscape that makes you feel a void inside you making you anxious is at par with his eminence in composing scores. The background score makes you feel the importance of time (something with which Nolan likes to play, A LOT!) and there's not much left of it for our soldiers with great cheekbones stranded on the beach.\n\nTalking about Hoyte van Hoytema's diligence that he put in to Dunkirk, the film is also a feast to your eyes other than to your ears. With deft aerial shots, close ups and air battle sequences, I was reminded of Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity and the work of Emmanuel Lubezki in the same. Though in my opinion Lubezki is a better cinematographer (Birdman, The Revenant, The Tree Of Life), Hoytema's work is awe-inspiring.\n\nComing to Nolan, weaving three different temporal threads about the same event (one a week long, the other a day, and the last one an hour long) and seaming them together at the end with non-linear descriptive story telling without much dialogues is dexterous. Mr. Nolan never fails to amaze you with his shrewdness. The muffled bombardment sequences, the tense atmosphere and the minimalistic airborne fight sequences bespeak volume of Nolan's calibre.\nComing to the actors, everyone does a pleasing job (even Harry Styles, no kidding). Not much to talk about Tom Hardy as his face remains masked about ninety percent of his screen time and despite that he was effective in making us feel his presence, Mark Rylance proves himself again as a worthy Oscar-winning actor even with so much less screen time. Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy are equally fair. Aneurin Barnard has hardly one or two lines but expresses everything with his face and Fionn Whitehead establishes himself as a newcomer.\n\nThe plot of the film is a bit thin and the movie is not character-driven but rather event-driven. And despite these flaws (or maybe it was something that Nolan had in mind), Dunkirk shows us how war makes us forget humanity at times. Glorifying and rhapsodizing a retreat operation to some extent, Dunkirk is still some Oscar worthy content; something that will go into the special vaults because of Nolan, Hoytema and Zimmer.

Also, with the help of Hans Zimmer's haunting soundtrack, he leads his talented cast (with Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles standing out among the newcomers) through non-stop tension, but little else. In other words, \"Dunkirk\" serves as a exceptionally intense and different war film, even though it sacrifices empathy for subtle political commentary.",

            "content": "What a disappointment this was. No real story line (was there really any plot?), unbelievable flat characters, historical fantasy and unrealistic scenery and real film errors. \nDetails can make or break a historical movie and this one has so many errors. We see the harbour of the real Dunkirk with large modern warehouses and even modern container cranes in the background. And what about the ships in 1940, they were not welded but riveted. But in this movie there is no clinch bolt to see at the real ships.  Furthermore very slow and clumsy air combat (a Spitfire is doing 400-500 kmh,  the bomber about 230, but it takes ages for the Spitfire to follow that bomber. And every time the Spitfire are shot from a very close distance by the Germans without any reaction of the British pilots. This way they wouldn't have any chance in combat for more than a minute. Every character is doing the patriotic \"right\" thing (with one exception, the shell shock soldier). \nReality was that only a few civilian ships had civilian crews in this operation, the rest had navy crews on them. In this movie it seems impossible that 300.000 men were brought to England because the rate of survival in this movie is very very low. Everybody get bombed or drowns in sinking ships. Because there were almost 400.000 French, Belgian and British soldiers packed together in Dunkirk it must have been so crowded everywhere. But in this movie we see an almost untouched and empty city and on the beaches there are most of the time only a few dozen or few hundred men waiting. The director lost me almost from minute one where we see a very unrealistic action scene in which a group of men is slaughtered in the streets of Dunkirk with only one survivor. He got to the French defence line and jumps over it and within a few meters he is on the beach without any battle noise or shelling. That was so unbelievable that it looked more like Alice in Wonderland then  a realistic war movie. \nSo I think this movie is one of the worst \"historical\" movies I have ever seen in a movie theater.",

            "content": "Three years after Christopher Nolan and his wife, Emma Thomas sailed across the English channel, they bring to us this war drama centered around the evacuation at Dunkirk. Just like the battle at Waterloo, the battle at Dunkirk, or more appropriately Dunkerque is etched deep into Britain's memory. However, unlike most films of war, Dunkirk is not about a triumph, but of a long and laboured loss. The film takes place at a time during World War II, when England was cornered by Axis powers on all fronts, and her soldiers were forced to retreat to the French beaches (Western front).\n\nThe Battle of Dunkirk is memorable for many reasons. It reminds us of the time when England was forced to it's knees and had to resort to begging and prayer in the face of the aggressive Axis powers. It is also a story of a nation's solidarity towards its troops, who had returned with nothing more than harrowing tales of war and uniforms which were never to be adorned by victory medals.\n\nHowever, most of us didn't contemplate buying a ticket because of our intellectual interest in British history. We just wanted to watch Nolan's brilliance shine on screen once again, after Inception, Interstellar, and the Dark Knight Trilogy. And who can blame us? The man is a genius. Sadly, Dunkirk was not as phenomenal as his previous masterpieces. Why? Read on.\n\nA film is brilliant because of the careful cohesion of many factors. Realistic cinematography, relevant themes, a meaty script and sharp performances under experienced direction. Chirstopher Nolan and his team are well aware of the concepts of film-making and what makes a movie tick. However, this time they forgot about the audience's sentiment. Nolan films are famous for their irregular timeline and a shocking twist at the very end. They are famous for being aspirational and fantastical. This time, maybe on a whim to test his versatility, Nolan decided to make a simple, fact based, realistic film. (Boring? Some may say so).\n\nDunkirk is an evacuation/rescue film (not a war film), told from three different perspectives. The Army, the Navy and the Airforce, or to put it more simply, land, water and air. The film follows the lives of a few soldiers and a few civilians engaged in a doomed rescue process. It shows, very evidently, that war is no one's friend and is only a fight for survival. Soldiers are not depicted as iron-willed heroes, but shell-shocked and crest-fallen boys. The true enemy is not he who stands behind the lines and shoots, but it is war itself. Traumatised soldiers scurrying to find refuge, having discarded human sensibilities, hoping to reach eutopia, which is a home that they can see, but not reach, is the basis of Dunkirk. (Fascinating? Some would say so)\n\nThe issue we see with Dunkirk however, lies not in it's beautiful cinematography, or it's accuracy, or even in it's choice of subject matter, but in it's script. The script is deficient in more than one way. The characters have not been introduced or developed adequately. Far too much time is spent on the description of the predicament. The side stories have nothing of quality to offer to the main storyline. It's not haphazard (since Nolan time is now cherished), but it really is poorly written. Realistic cinema need not be scarce in terms of content. Just like a body without a skeleton, a film without a gripping story is bound to appear dysfunctional.\n\nAdditionally, the ambiguity of war is attempted to be conveyed through the ambiguity of dialogue in the film. All the actors are given a maximum of five dialogues to work with. The proficiency of acting can be conveyed through expression, but silence is never a feature of war. Hurried chaos and rushes of adrenaline may well be characteristic of war.\n\nNitpicking aside, Fionn Whitehead and Tom Hardy are brilliant in their performances. They truly did add much more body to the film. Even when Fionn Whitehead is smeared with oil and underwater, he manages to convey the spirit of survival from nothing more but his eyes. Tom Hardy is a well known British favourite, and we wish Fionn Whitehead many more opportunities to perform in the future.\n\nWhat stands out in the film is the beautiful cinematography, the accuracy and the realism. What doesn't deserve much mention is the background score (Hans Zimmer disappoints as well), the dry script without a single stimulating moment and the crude editing. Christopher Nolan has tried his hand at a different form of cinema. He has made a good film, but it isn't necessarily likable. Nolan fans might feel dissatisfied. (We know we did). Dunkirk is similar to an impressionist painting. It's perfect, but doesn't necessarily elicit a world of emotion. It's beautiful but not mind-boggling.\n\nWhether you should buy a ticket this weekend is entirely a personal choice. If you want another interstellar, watch this one on television screens. If you want to be reminded of the futility (not the horrors), of war while sitting in an air conditioned hall, go ahead and buy a ticket. We give it 3.5/5.\n\nYou will like this film if: you liked Revenant and Into The Wild\n\nYou will dislike this film if: you either went in expecting another Interstellar, or you simply don't care about Nolan's cinema\n\nBest performance: Tom Hardy \n\nwww.wittyghost.com",

            "content": "While visually stunning, action packed, and very well acted this movie falls flat as it attempts to both show the broad story of the evacuation of Dunkirk while focusing on about eight different characters that are barely fleshed out. \nThe movie is generally split between three different points of view; the beach of soldiers struggling to survive as they await evacuation, a plane squad coming to defend the soldiers, and a small boat coming to take as many soldiers as possible back to England. These different points of view are seemingly on slightly different timelines, meaning that you may see a plane crash happen from the pilot's perspective and then again 20 minutes later from the boat owner's perspective. These time shenanigans feel simply pointless and add nothing but confusion to the plot.\nAnother effect of the many different points of view is that no character is focused on nearly enough to be known by the audience. They all lack any unique personality traits or specific goals other than doing their jobs and/or not dying. This leaves many character actions feeling random and the danger that they are in no different to the danger of any other background character. For example, there is a scene in which our main soldier on the ground (who is in most posters of the movie) must escape a ship that has been hit by a torpedo, swimming in a sea of struggling soldiers and nurses our hero escapes through an open door that a friend of his opened. However the viewer am left thinking far less about his safety and far more about all those other helpless soldiers who are drowning and who our protagonist has just done nothing to help.\nThis lack of characterisation only becomes more and more apparent as the characters move from action scene to action scene, it being clear that the characters are really only vehicles for the audience to see all the different horrible ways people are dying. And while the lack of reason in the deaths of many soldiers may be intended as commentary on the lack of reason in war, the camera still focuses far more on the assigned \"protagonists\" of each point of view as if their lives matter more than those of anyone else on screen.\nThe sound design and music while technically well done becomes overbearing quickly as pounding music continues through almost every scene, creating a sense of impending danger whether or not there is any reason for there to be one. I personally also found it overly loud, which while realistic for a battlefield caused me to just cover my ears during many of the climactic scenes.\nOverall Dunkirk is a disappointingly flat movie that I would not recommend to anyone except maybe a history buff or camera man.",

It includes Kenneth Branagh as a Royal Navy officer overseeing the evacuation from a rickety mole at Dunkirk.\nMark Rylance (Bridge Of Spies) portrays the sailor of one of the small boats with probably the best performance of the film.\nTom Hardy flies a Spitfire above with aerial photography that puts Top Gun to shame.\nEven the boyband One Direction ex member Harry Styles puts in a good performance in his acting debut.\nAs mentioned the photography is excellent making full use of the IMAX cameras the film used especially in the aerial shots.\nDirecting plaudits go to Christopher Nolan of Batman Begins fame.\nBefore you know it the near two hour film elapsed and I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. \nThe sound was deafening.

            "content": "I saw Dunkirk 4 days ago, but I really wanted to sit on the experience and not review it until I fully understood what Christopher Nolan was going for. This isn't your typical war movie, neither it terms of structure or execution. But it is how you'd expect Christopher Nolan to tackle a war epic; with a non-linear structure, tightly written and directed scenes, and one heck of a mind-blowing score from Hans Zimmer. It's far from the easiest film to dissect, but the experience is undeniably moving.\n\nBeing a massive Christopher Nolan fan, I came into Dunkirk with high expectations and a ton of curiosity of how Nolan would treat a true story. This is the first film of is that attempts to take real-life events and present his own depiction. Unsurprisingly, the thing I love most about Dunkirk is Nolan's direction. Quite often war films look at the big picture (rightfully so), covering events from each side and telling in-depth stories about politics and survival. There's nothing wrong with those approaches, but the fact that Nolan takes a massive-scale approach to Dunkirk visually, when in reality the film is just about soldiers trying to survive on one particular beach, makes it all the more impressive. When you get past the fact that there's little dialogue and character development, there's plenty to love about Dunkirk.\n\nNolan's films all have those defining visual moments, as he often loves to have his non-linear structure be used to its full effect and use the multiple story angles to create a few epic moments. Think Inception, when the \"dream is collapsing\" and there's 3 different layers of dreams all coalescing at the same time. Dunkirk uses that same approach for pretty much the entire movie, The Mole (beach), The Sea, and The Air. The editing can be frustrating the first time around, as it was for me, especially when you really just want to learn more about each of these characters if they expect us to care at all. Jumping viewpoints turns out to be exactly the way this film should be structured. In reality, none of these soldiers would have time to tell each other their respected backgrounds or life stories, they're just trying to survive. I thought Nolan handled this beautifully.\n\nComplementing the rapid editing is yet another terrific Hans Zimmer score. Nolan said in an interview that he gave Zimmer a recording of a ticking clock to give him an idea as to how he wanted the tone of the score to feel. Well, Zimmer took that to heart as that ticking clock is literally heard throughout the film. I love all of the Zimmer-Nolan collaborations, and Dunkirk is no exception. In fact, Zimmer's score could almost be considered more of an impactful character than the real characters themselves. There aren't many composers that can match the intensity that Nolan wants behind and in front of the camera, but Zimmer definitely does.\n\nFrom Tom Hardy's almost dialogue-less performance, to the breathtaking cinematography from Hoyte van Hoytema, and the incredible work done by Hans Zimmer, Dunkirk is a film which sees Christopher Nolan at the top of his craft. It's the shortest film of his since 'Following' but it may very well be his most emotionally effective film, and that's without developing any characters. Every year I'm hoping to see movies that change the way cinema is made and viewed, Nolan is one of the few directors that constantly break new ground in Hollywood. As much as Dunkirk isn't what I thought it would be, I can't ask for anything more than for him to reinvent the genre.\n\n+Score\n\n+Non-linear structure\n\n+Mind-blowingly gorgeous visuals\n\n+The best air-force sequences ever from a war film\n\n10/10",

It was beautifully shot, expertly crafted, the music was fantastic, etc; cinematography-wise it's very much a Nolan movie. \n\nHowever, the disjointed story line, the loudness (saw this in IMAX), the unintelligible dialogue (however little there was), the pacing, it was all just so jarring, and scrambled, and un-engaging, IMO. \n\nI just didn't care about any of the characters, I kept getting distracted by the constant cutting-away to different story lines (whenever I would try to digest what I just saw, something entirely different was going on and try as I might I just couldn't keep up), and 90% of the dialogue sounded mumbled to me.  \n\nIn the end, I left feeling frustrated and like I just witnessed a great big giant mess, a beautiful one, but a mess nonetheless. \n\nI give it a C+; wasted talent, imo. \n\nI think if i bothered to watch this again, at home, with subtitles, my rating would probably go up to a B-; but I only feel a very small desire to do so.",

We believe we need a main character with some cliche backstory and the ability to not be killed or damaged, but this movie depicts a real perspective of a solider as they try to fight a losing battle.\n\nThe intertwining stories are both a positive and a negative. It's nice to see how all the stories meet up as they take place in a week, a day and an hour before all linking. The disadvantage is being able to foresee some results of what happens, which can ruin the tension of the solid soundtrack by Zimmer.\n\nThose looking for bloodshed and gore will be disappointed at this movie as it doesn't show any, but in my opinion, gore cheapens the moment and ruins the somber atmosphere created. Action movie junkies should also look elsewhere you won't have a Rambo type mount a jeep and fly straight into a German plan only to perform a superhero landing.\n\nThis movie all round is a great interpretation by Nolan of the battle of Dunkirk and strongly recommend to anyone who is looking for a worthwhile war film or a film in general for that matter.",

This movie should be retitled, because it does not show even a shred of Dunkirk in it's entirety. The movie was about a bunch of British military guys disregarding rules/orders and doing anything they can to get on an evacuation ship before it was their turn to do so. \n\nAlso, spoiler alert, in the movie there is a pilot who seems to be flying in the air for a VERY long time (he had 50 gallons of gas left BEFORE the civilian ships arrived, and somehow he landed on the beach at Dunkirk AFTER the Germans has taken over the area and the soldiers had been evacuated).\n\nWOW - I'd like to know what the director and producers were taking when they made this one.\n\nIt makes no sense how this movie can be rated so highly. \n\nDon't watch this movie and hope to see heroes and a lot of inspiring scenes - you will see very little of that. \n\nAlso, to all of those people who initially believed the movie \"dissed\" France:\nYou are totally wrong, my perception of this movie was that France was given more credit than the British!

            "content": "I was looking forward to this movie, and I wanted to like it. But I was disappointed. I hove historical movies, and war movies in particular. This is a story that I was thrilled to see portrayed in movie form. But in the end, in my opinion, this movie tried to be more of an art film / prestige movie than tell the story in question.\n\nFirst, the good:\n- Visually, the movie is very well done in my opinion. The sets, and backdrops and naval scenes and dogfights are all very nicely filmed / rendered, and they meld together very well.\n- The acting was good in most respects as well.\n\nWhy was I disappointed? (WARNING: SPOILERS):\n- The confusing time jumps - I see no reason why we had to follow the story from three different perspectives that happened over three different time periods. I don't think this added anything to the story except confusion. I went into the movie knowing that the story was broken down in this way, so I was ready for the possible confusion, and even so I did not like it. A family came into the move late and sat behind me. I felt bad for them because if you missed the first few minutes when the movie sort-of explained the time differences, then it must have been very confusing indeed.\n- The constant (and I mean CONSTANT) background mood music - From beginning to end there was a bed of ambient mood music. I found this distracting and a little insulting. It seemed to me that the movie makers were trying to trick me into following their mood expectations instead of telling a good story and letting me decide where my moods should be. It also felt like they were artificially trying to constantly raise the tension level through the whole movie.\n- A few other story elements that I didn't feel were accurate (technicalities, really) -\n   The scenes felt desolate and forgotten. I would think that the greatest military evacuation in history would feel a little more crowded. They mentioned that the Royal Navy and RAF could only spare a few ships and planes, so that had some credibility. But as I understand it, hundreds of small vessels took place in the final evacuation. In the movie, the main civilian vessel we followed seemed to travel completely alone across an empty English Channel, and the largest group of civilian vessels the movie portrayed seemed to be about two dozen. I was expecting to see a lot more German planes and British 'little ships'. I felt like this movie was portraying some small sideshow forgotten battle rather than the end of a MAJOR phase of the largest war in human history. Maybe the movie is technically accurate, but I didn't buy it.\n   Were Spitfires designed as gliders? - As the movie was coming to a climax, a Spitfire interceptor ran out of fuel in mid-air, but then proceeded to glide for a very, very long time. I simply didn't believe it. It seemed like the pilot could have glided back to England for as long as he was cruising back and forth over the Dunkirk beach. Again, this may have been technically accurate and might happen under optimal conditions, but I really didn't like this.\n\nConclusion:\nI don't regret paying to see Dunkirk at the movie theater. But the combination of jumping back and forth in time, and the constant music bed made Dunkirk feel to me more like an hour-and-a-half theatrical preview of a longer movie - a very long highlight reel. I won't spend any more money on this movie. If I play this movie again, it will be muted so I won't be annoyed by an unwanted, constant soundtrack and can just enjoy some wonderfully executed visuals.",

The film score by Hans Zimmer is amazing using his mastery of shepard tones to really drive the intensity. But if you go in looking for character building and development don't!

It wastes no time setting up the premise. This is a different war movie then what you may be used to. It doesn't dive into the lives of individual soldiers. There aren't any babies being kissed, or girlfriends hugged goodbye. After watching the movie, I realized that I couldn't even name a single character. That's not a bad thing. Nolan makes it clear that the focus of this film is on the event of Dunkirk. Nothing more, nothing less. For some, this may be a turn off as there aren't really any characters to relate with. There aren't any emotional sub plots to follow. This was strictly - Dunkirk. These are the soldiers trapped, and the German are coming to kill them. The movie showcases the realism of war; Not all stories end in happy endings. During war, soldiers die alone, in the dark, confused, and/or unaware. The creative use of editing at one point early in the movie makes a lightbulb click in your head, \"Ohhh so that's what's happening.\" Honestly, the main gripe I had with this movie was that it was hard to understand what someone was saying at times (heavy English accents). I'm a southern boy from Texas, and picking up on full sentences was near impossible for me. I'm not sure if others had this problem, probably not!

Well over 300,000 troops were saved by the evacuation yet I never had the feeling that more than a few thousand were ever endangered. Finally, thousands of small ships composing a small armada were involved in the evacuation, yet the movie gave me the feeling that maybe a medium sized yacht club came to the troops' rescue.

            "content": "A war film that deals with the war without the Hollywood glow and veneer that plagues far too many efforts of recent years and is actually, pleasingly, devoid of any \"for the sake of it\" gore and blood. Although that doesn't mean that it shirks away from the horror of conflict in any way.\n\n'Dunkirk' deals with the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from France in 1940, after a disastrous British and French campaign to defeat the German Army on French soil, initiated by the former's declaration of war on the latter eight months previously. The British and French Armies (plus others like the Belgians) proved unable to deal with the Germans as they steamrolled through France in just six weeks. Something that proved impossible to do in the whole of WWI.\n\nNone of that history is really needed to enjoy the film although I feel, like with most war films, a certain understanding is useful (if somewhat unnecessary) to flesh out the events on the screen. But all one needs to know here is that the Allies have been defeated and the British are looking for a way out. The miles and miles of beaches at Dunkirk fortuitously proved to be it.\n\nChristopher Nolan's film does extremely well to capture the dejected spirits of the men as they trickle down through the beachfront property to the sandy shoreline and form orderly (and terribly British) queues, while they patiently wait for a transport (any transport) to arrive and take them back to Blighty. The images of these queues are matched by period photographs and that attentiveness is what makes 'Dunkirk' a great success, at least the in the \"Mole\" section of the film, which is one of three timelines that the story is split across. \"The Mole\" (another name for a pier) takes place over the course of the week, whereas \"The Air\" is over one hour and \"The Sea\" is a day's journey. All sections are intertwined in a back and forth timeline, with the The Air being the weakest contribution.\n\n\"The Mole\" unfolds largely from the viewpoint of a British soldier, an unnamed private, ably handled by Fionn Whitehead. Whitehead does well to capture the fear, confusion, dread and humiliation of the average \"Tommy\" in a largely \"dialogue-less\" role. Something that isn't easy to do. He acts as our eyes as he passively observes the situations and people who make up the souls trying to escape the portion of the beach he finds himself on. The Mole is the meat of the film upon which the other two sections are hung and contains the more harrowing of scenes. These are chilling scenes of men drowning in steel hulls as the ship they're stranded on becomes their horribly echoey tomb.\n\n\"The Sea\" deals with the \"little armada\" of civilian boats that was requisitioned by the Royal Navy, because they didn't want to commit the bulk of the Navy to the rescue mission. It focuses on pleasure boater, Mr. Dawson, his son Peter and his friend George, who take it upon themselves to head to Dunkirk to see if they can aid the evacuation. This is based on true accounts of hundreds of boat owners who sailed south in the last days of May 1940 in an admirable, if foolhardy, crusade of sorts. Mild mannered Mr. Dawson is very well played by Mark Rylance who's understated performance contrasts with the horrors unfolding in the water around his little boat.\n\n\"The Air\" focuses on a Spitfire sortie across the channel and their task to deal with the Luftwaffe attacks on the evacuation effort. Tom Hardy is second in a vic of three, lead vocally by Michael Caine. This section is laudable for its use of period aircraft, in the case of the Spitfire MkI and does well to get a post war Spanish made Buchon into the air to act as a Bf109E. Elsewhere there's also a post war Spanish Heinkel playing its part as a target for Hardy's far too good pilot. It's Hardy's unrealistic ability to destroy everything with a Balkenkreuz on it that forms the only real mis-step in the film. Also on a bad note is the film's portrayal of the Germans, who act as suicidal maniacs. While the film went to great lengths to get details correct, it's depiction of Luftwaffe tactics is a mess. 109's linger in turning fights with Spitfires and the film's only German bomber goes around on a bombing run, practically offering themselves as targets. Anyone who's familiar with the air war in WWII will be rolling their eyes, which is a shame because the filmmakers get so much correct elsewhere.\n\nHowever, the above criticisms will only be spotted by a handful of people and while it knocks points off, it doesn't destroy the film altogether. It's still hard not to be disappointed about Hardy's \"Greatest Spitfire Pilot of all Time\" caricature.\n\nAnother criticism would be the lack of use of CGI to augment to air battles. Although some CGI was used to enhance the Stuka remote control models. While I believe Nolan's refusal to do a sweeping vista of a beach full of hundreds of thousands of men was a wise one (as there were never that number on any of the beaches at one time), the limited air war feels extremely anemic. It's correct that the Luftwaffe confined its attacks to mere pin prick harassment, in lieu of an all out attempt to destroy the BEF, but it's doubtful that any Heinkel crew would be flying into enemy territory alone as is depicted in the film. Those scenes are, of course, victims of the lack of physically available aircraft. But, they could easily have been fleshed out with computer generated ones to inject a bit more realism. I believe there could have been a balance attempted, instead of a flat out refusal.\n\nElsewhere, Nolan correctly refuses to make the film reliant on an \"characters\". The fact of the matter being that in real military units, the men rarely got to know one another very well. Men were transferred in and out of units, killed, wounded and captured, that you tended not to know anybody for too long. It would have been a mistake to make the film a squad based cliche with the accompanying Screen Writing 101 \"characters\", that so many war films do. While this can be troublesome for some viewers, I found it to be another feather in its cap. A cap which possesses quite a large number of feathers, it has to be said. Another of which is Hans Zimmer's spectacular, yet wholly unassuming score. Almost totally devoid of bombast, it's low bass pounding does wonders to increase the sense of dread and tension of the scenes unfolding on the screen. It's an expert example of what a cinematic score should do. It aids the film, without overwhelming it. In one or two places, it swells to unconvincing heights, such as its pinching of Elgar's 'Nimrod', as Hardy lands his out of fuel Spitfire on the beach. But, 99% of the time it aural support is absolutely bang on.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, 'Dunkirk' is a war film that will largely please people who have studied the war, as I have for more years than I'll mention here. It's emotional, without being forced. It's horrifying in places, without being obsessed about it. It's reasonably factual, without being dull. For me, it joins a small number of war films that can be called great and Christopher Nolan et al deserve all the praise they get.",

Dunkirk offered no real plot or direction besides the outcome that is known history. Character development was extremely limited. It's almost as if Nolan chose this way on purpose because he did not want viewers to connect to any of these characters on any level. This movie explained nothing of the actual Dunkirk event and failed to capture me in almost every way.  It left me anxious and distracted, not knowing how to feel about the movie in a large, more general sense.  The consistent, busy scenes which lasted from start to finish in Dunkirk offered a shallow, hollow attempt that this movie was exciting and thrilling.

Ive loved Nolan's films in the past, but there are literally hundreds of stronger war time films than this. People are saying that this is a film 'War is hell', I'd argue totally the opposite, war appears clean and non violent due to the 12a rating i expect, none of our main characters where ever in any real peril and I wouldn't even have cared if they were. I don't even care what happens to Tom Hardy's character at the end. I don't think it looks particularly nice, I much preferred Nolan's films when they were being shot by Wally Pfister.

Think skydiving footage in Moonraker, the opening plane heist in Dark Knight Rises and multiply it a hundred times. No CGI. No shortcuts. Real film making. Admirable and far reaching. \n\nA shorter film than normal for Nolan, presumably because of the size of the projector. Five miles of massive film strips. Bits of debris trapped in the camera gate made me think oh no I'm going to see this all the time now. But they disappeared from cut to cut, only raising my appreciation of Nolan's achievement. Yes, I love this film.\n\nIt could do with a few extra scenes, setting off from the English coast, maybe more loading of soldiers, but they'd only soften the film's impact, and you can fill the gaps yourself.

It's a war movie unlike any other war movie by many\nterms. Sure there is despair , anger , pain , fear and most importantly terror filled in the entire\nmovie. But the movie never ever lets you sit and catch your breath and relax till the next heart\npounding scene comes as the entire movie is a non stop thrill ride, nor it fills you up with hope\nof a victory but it states that sometimes avoiding annihilation is a triumph. This is movie is\nsomehow not about war it's about the terror of war, the horrific outcome and the\nunforgiving-unjust nature of the war.\n\nChristopher Nolan in his 10th film achieves a sense of fear among viewers that lasts even after\nthe movie has ended. There are no consoling conversations between soldiers nor any personal\nchoices or family details , but what there is , is the only instinct that anyone on earth is born\nwith, Survival. Movie doesn't waste time in developing characters and motivational dialogues\nas no one in that situation will actually do that. Sure the lack of deep characters can be a sore\nthumb for many but that's the point of the movie , it's about the situation and the event not\nabout characters. You still root for these guys and feel sad when they die in horror, without\nknowing their names, and that's the beauty of the cinema that Nolan has created.\nThen there is the genius of the storytelling via distinctive vantage points. All in different\ntimelines and without spoiling it i would tell you to read the minimal text very carefully when\nthese are introduced for the first time very early in the film. That just adds layers to the\nstorytelling which will definitely be appreciated more on a second viewing. I rather not tell you\nabout the cast than just that it's filled with award winners and future award winners. Without\nhaving much to do verbally they have conveyed many things through their actions and large\nportion of the credit goes to the direction.\n\nChristopher Nolan has brought freshness to an era and genre of filmmaking that has been a\nchoice of directors since almost last 80 years. A war movie without many war scenes, one\nwhich during the entire length of the movie has not shown the opposition once , as in you\ndefinitely see enemy bullets flying , bombs jumping , aircrafts piercing air but not a single\nGerman face up until the last minute of the movie, still you are in dead fear of the situation and\nterrorized by the opposition like the Britishers and french are as if you were there. This is\nmostly achieved by the beautiful practical visuals effects from Hoyte Van Hoytema and an\nsuperbly original and chilling score by Hans Zimmer. When you go in a war movie you feel\nwhat can a world war II movie bring to the table that's fresh, still while exiting you are left\nwith an experience none like any other in this category.\n\nIt's a must watch for any war movie fans or any movie fans , don't expect a one to one\ngun-fight here rather than its a survival movie in which the hell is cut loose and you have\nnowhere to go other than to be with them , feel with them, fear with them....\n9.7 /10 AMAZing",

Mostly the French and British. It was an interesting movie to watch in regards to learnining history but if anyone wants to go to watch an action war movie like many in the past (saving private Ryan) or even get something out of it.

They just didn't make an effort to show the massive undertaking that the real rescue operation at Dunkirk was....and they missed it in EVERY facet.......not enough soldiers (not even close), no where near enough boats....not enough conflict, not enough planes........it was so disappointing.  The only recent war film it can be compared to is Saving Private Ryan...which made a massive ( and quite acceptable) effort to TRY and show the intensity and insanity of D-Day beach landings......if Private Ryan gets an A for the effort (it's probably impossible to recreate D-Day on film), Dunkirk squeaks by with a low C.  An evacuation of 400,000 men that had maybe, MAYBE 5,000 actors standing in 15 lines on an open beach?  Missed it big time.  The boats?  never more that 3 or 4 Navy ships in a scene.....and, at most - maybe 25 small boats - with, sadly, a back ground of wide open, expansive ocean....no sense of intensity, no sense of urgency, no sense of scale....it looked more like a pleasant day of sailing than a military. rescue operation.... Sorry - this was an average film at best .....a rescue of 331,000 soldiers by 220 naval warships and 700 small private boats simply cannot be depicted well by 5,000 actors and 30 boats....especially with so many pull away shots showing smooth, empty beaches and wide open calm oceans...the director and producer just missed the boat",

            "content": "DUNKIRK is a different kind of war movie. Unlike other films in the genre, this film has few obviously named characters, no overt bullet holes or blood splatter, and no obvious narrative arc. Instead, it depicts three arenas: land (primarily beachfront), sea, and air. And where other directors use multiple quick cuts and slow-mo and repeated views of the same scene from different angles to capture explosions and deaths in the greatest possible coverage, Christopher Nolan doesn't do any of that, preferring to let the story unveil in long, unbroken cuts unmarred by quick shots, slow-mo, or the usual war movie camera tricks. Instead, he uses another mechanism which I won't spoil and it accomplishes the same thing in a radically different way. It is a way of telling the story that leans on the viewer to understand, the follow along, and when I fully understood what he was doing, I was blown away. \n\nIn this film, things like torpedoes and dropped bombs don't sound overblown but rather have the sense of authenticity. If anything, the lack of Hollywood mega-explosions make the sound of munitions in this film all the more creepy. A scene in the belly of a small tramp freighter where Germans were shooting randomly into the hull was particularly freaky, not because of some constant barrage but because of the random nature of the shots.\n\nDUNKIRK begins almost immediately with the British and French forces in peril, pinned by blitzkrieging German forces back against the beach. Leaflets fall in the first scene showing how surrounded they are and the beach where they are is not optimal for loading men on destroyers. Nolan shows a number of ships sinking in this film and it looks for all the world to me like they were real ships really scuttled.\n\nNolan is famous for preferring in-camera practical effects and shooting with real film, and that is a real strength here. The film was reportedly made using 70mm film captured with IMAX cameras, the first feature film I know of that is filmed 100% with IMAX cameras. When seen on the right screen with the right sound system, the sensory effect is stunning, nearly overwhelming. An early scene with diving Stuka bombers filled me with dread, a sonic assault which I was later informed was a deliberate propaganda design decision.\n\nThere is never any indication that the Brits will be able to 'win' this battle. Indeed, the best they can hope for is anything less than the complete annihilation or capture of 400,000 troops, a setback that would essentially knock Britain out of the war. And yet the leaders on the dock overseeing the recovery efforts never lose faith, never lose their cool, keeping hoping that something will salvage the day. There is a real 'miracle of Dunkirk' which was not depicted here but it's a fascinating bit of history.\n\nI very much enjoyed all aspects of this film but my absolute favorite sequences were the aerial scenes. Tom Hardy stands out for how much emotion he conveyed using just his eyes. (He's a master of 'less is more.' My son remembered how Hardy owned LAWLESS with few lines and an expressive series of grunts.) Furthermore, a pilot friend of mine marveled at the attention to detail in the RAF pilot gear. He said the angled goggles were period-correct and the reason why it's better for a pilot to bail out in the air versus ditching in the water is frequently the frame would bend on impact and the cockpit canopy would become difficult or impossible to open from within. The scenes in the air depicted how valiant and desperate the RAF pilots were, and how indispensable the air cover was.\n\nPerhaps my favorite aspect of the film were the various moral dilemmas faced by all the desperate men and how they handled themselves. There's a subplot with a soldier who doesn't speak and it played out like a Greek tragedy.\n\nOverall, this was a genre film told in a fresh way where the result of the story was stunning and magnificent. Nolan told the story in a clear but clever way which minimized the uber-violence but maximized the human peril of a dire situation. And finally,  featuring what looked like a cast of thousands and filmed with practical effects and super sharp IMAX cameras, the overall effect was the greatest sensory experience I've ever had in the theater.\n\n5 / 5",

            "content": "There is something truly mesmerizing about Christopher Nolan's epic film, \"Dunkirk.\" As the director has stated in recent interviews, \"Dunkirk\" is not a war film; it is a film about survival. It turns out that \"Dunkirk,\" a film that follows British forces during the events of World War II, is just that. In fact, this film goes against the status quo of most war movie epics of the past twenty or so years. \"Dunkirk\" is a PG-13, gore-less masterpiece. Unlike \"Saving Private Ryan,\" \"Hacksaw Ridge,\" \"Platoon,\" and \"Apocalypse Now\" (among others) that rely heavily of blood and vulgarity, \"Dunkirk\" relies on the story itself to deliver relentless tension and shock to a film that is under two hours long.\n\nThe film follows three story lines: air, land and sea. It is important to note that each story, while connected with each other, serve different timelines. In fact, the land story arc, which follows Tommy (newcomer Fionn Whitehead) and the 400,000 stranded soldiers on the beaches of Dunkirk, shows time over the course of one week. The sea story arc, which follows Mr. Dawson (Academy Award winner Mark Rylance) and the civilian response to help rescue the stranded soldiers, is over the course of a day. Finally the air story arc, that follows Farrier (Tom Hardy) and his efforts to counter enemy combatants in the air, is over the course of one hour. Throughout the film, the story arcs shift to show different viewpoints of the evacuation of Dunkirk. While it may seem confusing with the overlapping story lines, the film never looses the viewer. Christopher Nolan masterfully directs the flow of the film to the point that each story ends with one another.\n\nThroughout the film's 107 minute runtime, \"Dunkirk\" never lets go of the tension. The film begins with Tommy and his comrades being ambushed by unknown forces in a town outside the beaches of Dunkirk. From there, the film never lets up until the credits begin to roll less than two hours later. Part of this comes from the fantastic sound editing that mimics the sound of war perfectly. Bullets penetrating objects end with a sharp, piercing sound that gets the viewers attention. Explosions are sudden and catch you by surprise. In addition to the sound, the lack of CGI adds to the realism of the action set pieces. Christopher Nolan, instead of using an overabundance of CGI, used real military planes and warships to reenact the Battle of Dunkirk. In fact, there is so little CGI that Nolan decided to use cardboard fill ins for soldiers on the beach. It is the little details like those that add to the masterpiece that is \"Dunkirk.\"\n\nWhile it has a lot of positives, \"Dunkirk\" does have its flaws. Due to a lack in dialogue and a short run time, \"Dunkirk\" almost feels like it is half filled. Besides Mr. Dawson, the characters introduced are never developed further than their names. This negatively affects the film as a whole when watching the action scenes. With little character development, I felt distant from the characters and did not have the want to root for them as much. While Christopher Nolan wanted to focus on the person's willingness to survive instead of his backstory, it does feel like something is missing. That being said, the horrors of World War II have been told in over a dozen films and Christopher Nolan acknowledges that. He wanted to focus on the fear of the soldiers and the courage of civilians without having this character's speak it. And it is done marvelously.\n\n\"Dunkirk\" is an exceptional film about survival and courage. With less focus on CGI and more efforts going into story arcs that leaves us catching our breathes, \"Dunkirk\" is one of the best \"war\" films ever made. If anyone thinks that a bloodless war film would not be great, try this one.\n\nGrade: A",

The lack of aggression by the withdrawing troops toward attacking aircraft is limited to one man using his enfield 303 whereas in fact the troops were encouraged to use every weapon at their disposal to shoot at attacking aircraft even if only to keep up moral.  I also note some very poor continuity through the film and factual mistakes.  The Spitfire landing on a sandy beach was unlikely to have used his undercarriage since that would have caused more damaged than a 'belly flop' tail first.  Added to that was the large 'container terminal visible in the background which of course did not exist until the 1960's. Like wise the 'fully illuminated' railway station during the blackout was almost as bad as the very 'modern' railway carriages used.  There were several other factors which would perhaps not be so noticeable by a younger generation but certainly such things would reduce the authenticity of the film to older viewers.  Finally I have to say the totally ignored the actions those very brave defenders who gave lives and many years of freedom (particularly French) to hold back the German attacks for such a long time to enable their comrades escape.",

            "content": "An intimate, daringly claustrophobic spectacle that transfixes the audience from opening sequence beyond. Dunkirk, spares the blaring action sequences, the large pugnacious combat, and even the expected melodrama. This is a strikingly, terrifying two-hour display of human emotion coursed throughout three perspectives; one on land, one on sea, and an hour in the sky. All equally enthralling, and dovetail in the coming conclusion of the film, very nicely. Nolan's greatest strengths and shortcomings are ostensible in this heart-thumping, survivalist narrative- but fortunately the shortcomings are few and far between.  Dunkirk follows a collective group of Allied soldiers during the year of 1940, pushed practically into the sea by German fleets along the French shorline. There seems to be little to no silver lining amongst the dreary, ominous threat that looms over them, but they must put their heads down and sink or swim. Dunkirk revels in this flustered mindset- fully embracing it and driving the narrative fullspeed until the lights go up.But what will quickly become apparent, and drastically salient for fanatics of the genre, is that Dunkirk draws away from fleshing out the individual souls at sea, land or roaring through the sky (save a few), rather it dramatizes the heavy circumstances that weigh on the thousands of soldiers collectively. This struck me as peculiar at first, as it did subvert my expectations. Which in retrospect, I shouldn't have been with the Nolan headlining every poster in heavy ink, but it draws subtle sentiments to classic expectations- without leaving a tiresome strain on the audience. Hitchcock's own survivalist war film: Lifeboat, garnered my attention in its own way, but was much more concentrated on melodramatic dialogue- but its characters strayed just slightly off stereotypical that it subverted expectation in its own way. With this film in mind, it only leads me to the conclusion of how far Nolan has taken this genre.\n\nNolan's ambitious narrative style really pays off, as the strings that are strung early on, tie a satisfying bow as the final act comes around. As a viewer, the tale draws both expansively to the large groups of soldiers on the brink of death with every turn, and synonymously orchestrates a picture of terrifying claustrophobia. The gritty, heart-rending, robust visuals lifting the stakes with every detail, and accentuated adequately with Hans Zimmer's score which is rhythmically similar to a ticking bomb. All this collectively, completes a message of ominous doom that seems inescapable.\n\nThe large cast of extras, and stars conflate nicely with the work behind the camera; drawing even more attention to the scale. Although, sometimes running together, a few exist salient throughout, including; Tom Hardy, who plays a pilot fending off German planes, as soldiers like Harry Styles (among a trio of soldiers) who scurry from the town along France's shoreline, towards a prayer for a serendipitous route of escape, to Mark Rylance, who plays an intrepid older gentleman who journeys into the war zone along with teenage sons, in search of soldiers to rescue. And Tom Hardy, isn't the only villain from Nolan's Batman trilogy who is casted in Dunkirk; Cillian Murphy gives a gripping performance, although much like others is dealt with few lines from an overall stingy script in that regard. Another\n\nHarry Styles, had an unexpected screen presence, and pulled through with his role with almost a \"star,\" affability. He might have a bright future ahead.

No se hace justicia al ejército francés ni al belga ni mucho menos a los batallones indios que estuvieron presentes. El hecho de montar las tres historias de la operación \"Dynamo\" en una sola línea de tiempo es muy buen recurso, la línea de los aviones Spitfire, la línea de los barcos civiles y la línea de los soldados escapando pero para muchos resultará confuso ya que son líneas de tiempo diferentes que se sobrelapan solo al final.

In this film, the Germans are entirely faceless, lingering in the skies above and the streets behind, and there is nary a mention of the enemy in the film, which I found odd. \n\nI expected to come out of the theatre with an easy 4 to 5 star review, but this film lacked most of what makes an epic WWII film...epic. There were over 300,000 casualties in the nine day evacuation, but thus film focuses on the survival of a select few, without ever humanizing them. \n\nI want to say that this film needs an R rating to deliver what I was expecting, but I suspect that given the narrative and theme Nolan was pursuing, PG-13 was on the money. \n\nIf you're expecting a depiction of the utter desperation and suffering of the soldiers at Dunkirk, you will be as disappointed as I was.

Not!\n\nFor entirely too much time we follow the rather blah storyline of a couple of soldiers scared apparently speechless, trying to escape the unfelt and except for the occasional Stuka, unseen German onslaught. \n\nSo, there are some great things about this film that I really enjoyed: \n\nThe scenes with Spitfires were super cool and had the most excitement and suspense in the whole movie except for possibly some of the boat scenes.\n\nThe cinematography was beautiful and captured the scene and feel very well. I saw it in XD. Just gorgeous.\n\nMark Rylance gave a great performance as the stoic, understated Englishman determined to make a difference. Kenneth Branagh did well in his limited screen time as the captain in charge of the evacuation. \n\nToo little time was spent on the evacuation. All of a sudden it just happens. Apparently, there was no drama or struggle to organize and carrying out the evacuation of 300,000+ soldiers other than having Branagh stand on the end of a pier looking longingly for the little boats to show up.  Perhaps? \n\nIt is a pity that such a historically significant event was given such an uninteresting treatment. So much more could have been done with this, but it looked too much like a khaki-clad army of zombies cueing on a beach waiting for a shipment of brains to snack on. \n\nIf there could have been context, like showing these guys had the poop kicked out of them (i.e. battle scenes)and that's why they're just standing around, or having desperate leaders up day and night organizing SOMETHING(drama) it would give the story more bite.

Having seen the film tonight I have very mixed feelings about it.  On the positive side, the acting was very good and the action sequences came across as very authentic.  Once again,  Nolan uses time shifting to portray three different strands of the film seemingly happening at the same time but which cover differing period of time (the beach sequences cover a week, the boat sequneces a day and the air sequences just one hour).  This is confusing as it appears at the start of the film that each strand begins at the same time yet but they also seem to converge together at the end of the film (when they clearly cant if covering different time periods!).  My two biggest gripes about the film, which ultimately dragged the film down for me from what could have been epic to mixed, were the characters themselves (I really couldnt invest any emotional attachment to them) and particularly the lack of scale of the task at hand. \n In reality this was an epic story but the scale of the film just didn't convey this for me with just a fraction of the actual men, boats, planes etc that were involved the the evacuation.  I appreciate Nolan decided not to use CGI to go for realism but for me this lack of scale ultimately disappointed.",

The dialogue is nigh impossible to decipher at times - it's not just the accent - and the runtime leaves room for deeper exploration, but Dunkirk is a very memorable film that should endure the test of time.",

Expectations can be a bad thing when it comes to movies especially when we are inclined to compare other movies of a similar genre.

But perhaps that's why it shouldn't have been done, and certainly not by a director known for his flair, and for telling fanciful stories as opposed to hard-hitting, cohesive ones.\n\nThe cinematography is nice, the acting is alright, the limited dogfights were a hoot to watch...that's the best I can say about this disjointed, random-feeling film. It has as much emotion as tuna salad, except for those moments which were drummed-up in contrived fashions. \n\nFor example, Admiral Branagh's hanging his head on the docks, awaited to be killed by an approaching German plane...but lo! He's saved by Tom Hardy, gliding his plane for seeming hours on no fuel, and saving all those soldiers below. \n\nThere's a downed pilot about to drown, his canopy stuck (when aren't they stuck in films like this?) but lo! He's saved by Mark Rylance, who loses yet another son in this film, while shrugging it off...C'est la guerre, indeed.\n\nOh, brother. Imagine Pearl Harbor being attacked by five Zeros, sinking two ships, and killing 20 soldiers while dropping bombs that simply blast sand in the air. Or imagine Dunkirk as done on The Hallmark channel (after 10 PM) and you've seen Dunkirk as presented by Nolan. Here is a film meant to dazzle, not educate. And don't forget to bring ear-plugs if you see it in theaters, which Nolan obviously meant for you to do; seriously, how about a film that looks good AT HOME as well as in cinemas, which fewer and fewer people are even attending anymore?",

So I expected the film to focus on this theme, but what we got was a series of vignettes surrounding an RAF pilot, a young British and French soldier trying desperately to get off the beach, and the crew of a small British civilian watercraft and their efforts to assist in the evacuation. What was missing was the sweeping immensity of the pending tragedy. We were treated to beach scenes with pristine groomed sands and almost no soldiers. The flotilla of boats that in reality was over 800 was never more than a few dozen in the movie. The whole immensity of the story was lost by ignoring these basic physical facts.

            "content": "Dunkirk, more like Dung-Crap! I have no idea why this movie received good reviews. Let me start with the good. This movie looked and sounded great in I-Max, and I saw this movie on $5 Tuesday. That's the end of the good. Now to the bad. This movie had no characters. I felt zero emotional connection to anyone in this movie. I didn't care if anyone lived or died or anything. Mark Rylance's (the BFG) character was the only one who was halfway interesting. He was the only character who had a decent amount of dialogue in the film, who had a clear goal, and who made decisions. The other character that had more than 5 lines in the picture was Kenneth Branagh's. He seemed utterly pointless. It seemed like he was watching the movie, and his purpose was just to say a cheesy lines about \"Home\" every once in a while. Tom Hardy's character was boring and repetitive, only to predictably save the day in the end. Because this movie is so messed up, it is really hard to decide who the main character is, but if I had to decide, it'd be the guy we see 1st. He is very forgettable. He looks and acts almost identical to his friend and almost everyone in the whole movie. He meets his friend while he is taking a dump. This is not a joke. So the main character doesn't poop. He stops and helps his new friend bury a body. And the guy doesn't poop the whole movie. And him and his new friend just try to escape the whole movie. That leads me to my second point: there is no plot. It's just a bunch of explosions. There's more plot in a Transformers movie. 'Poop guy' and 'bury dead body guy' just go from ship to ship trying to live. By the way, the movie is almost over before 'bury dead body guy' says anything. So these guys try to live, Kenneth Branagh stands on a dock and says things that don't matter, Mark Rylance picks up survivors in his boat, and Tom Hardy shoots other planes, while in his plane, over and over and over again, while not being seen or heard. And that's your movie. I kept waiting for the opening action sequence to be over. I kept waiting for it to slow down a little and have some exposition, but it never did. It was like I missed the beginning and just tuned into the climax of a long, humorless, silent picture. That's not to say that a movie can't be action packed and be great. U-571 is an example of a nearly non-stop, action packed, WWII movie, thrill ride. U-571 managed to have memorable and distinct characters with different purposes. U-571 had a plot with a clear goal and twists and turns. If Dunkirk could've just cut out some of the unnecessary bits, like Kenneth Branagh, and had the 1st half hour be set up and character development, then it could've been really good. But as it was, I didn't care about any of it. I kept watching English soldiers die and thinking, \"I don't care. This movie didn't make me care.\" As simple as the plot for Dunkirk was, the movie was really confusing. You'd think if you're going for an exciting, action thriller, that a simple linear plot would suffice. This movie jumps all over the timeline without giving any hint that it just made a jump in time. Christopher Nolan does a great job of jumping all over the timeline in his movie Memento. In Memento, he manages to keep things coherent and engaging. Not so here. This is just disappointing. The time jumping is completely unnecessary here. What little dialogue there is in this film is really hard to hear because of thick accents, loud explosions, masks over faces, and the music being really loud in the mix. With a really simple plot that is really hard to follow and characters with zero development or even distinguishing traits, I found myself in a really big struggle to care about what I was watching, even with incredible imagery and sound design. Yet, the whole time, the movie was telling me what I was watching was really exciting with it's music score. And that leads me to my last point: I hated the music. It pains me to say that because I usually love Hans Zimmer, especially under the direction of Christopher Nolan. There is virtually no melody in this score. It's relentless and annoying. I guess I can't blame Zimmer, considering he was just scoring to picture. Imagine watching The Dark Knight, but during the entire movie all you heard was The Joker's theme, non-stop. That's what it's like. The whole soundtrack may as well just be an air raid siren. And it's not just the music. The sound effects, as incredible as they were, were also loud, annoying, and relentless. At times, I found myself covering my ears. I thought, \"Why am I paying money to cover my ears? What I'm covering my ears to is what I paid for.\" You know what movie is better than this: all the movies I have seen this year. Valerian and The Mummy were even better. They were at least fun. The best movie I've seen this Summer is War for the Planet of the Apes, but you really need to see all the Apes pictures to get the full enjoyment out of that one. The next best is Spider-Man: Homecoming, but maybe you're not up to date with the Marvel movies. In that case, see Wonder Woman. You don't need to see the other DC movies to enjoy that one. But what ever you do, don't see Dunkirk. I beg of you not to give that garbage your support.",

Highlights the horrors of war, contrasted with young men simply trying to do their jobs as soldiers, and civilians attempting to help the war effort wherever they could, even by putting their lives at stake.\nWe saw this in the IMAX theatre on 70mm film, and it was an incredible visual spectacle. The screen and picture was massive and detailed, and the sound was pulsing and piercing so much to the extent that nearly every gunshot was frighteningly loud, to great effect. \nThe performances of the actors was good, with their fears and insecurities on display, but often difficult to tell the soldiers apart from each other (maybe that was the director's intention, to show that they were all just interchangeable young men when thrown into battle).\nThe music and sound was intense and scary, with ticking clocks or watches interspersing the musical score, to give a sense of urgency. \nClocking in under 2 hours, it was a great use of time, as many films lately are over the 2 hour point, which is when I tend to get bored. This film had my attention constantly, with a few exceptions while we were viewing the cockpit of a fighter plane, but those sequences illustrated the patience required by the pilots to get those perfect shots to take down an enemy. \nSuch a great film, nice to see there are still good Second World War films to be made. Definitely see this in the theatre if you can!\nWatched at Chinook in 70mm IMAX, with Sam, Andy, Clay, and Billy, July 23, 2017.",

Dunkirk takes you back to when Nazi Germany had the upper hand, claimed France, and their plan for Global conquest looked all to real. Christopher Nolan shows how wars are truly won, the unconditional love that civilians have for their military and far they are willing to go to rescue their champions.

            "content": "July 21, 2017\n\nChristopher Nolan's \"Dunkirk\" reaffirms just how powerful the movies can be when it comes to placing viewers in the moment. In this case, the moment is 1940 during World War II. The place is the French city of Dunkirk, where British soldiers have retreated to the coast after the German army has literally pushed them to the edge of the country. Under the most harrowing of conditions, these young men will endure, await rescue, and grow restless with uncertainty.\n\n\"Dunkirk\" is not only a superb film cinematically, with production (and post-production) values of the highest caliber, but the fact that it depicts and recreates a significant yet mostly unknown historical event makes it all the more meaningful. It opens our eyes, minds and hearts to what some soldiers during World War II had to bear. This isn't pleasant or romantic viewing, but it's nonetheless essential and incredibly riveting.\n\nAs a \"war picture,\" \"Dunkirk\" isn't as concerned about context as much as sensation, and yet this doesn't make it any less intellectually stimulating. The action that unfolds keeps our minds racing. Nolan, who also wrote the screenplay, introduces us to the battle at hand with just a few lines of white text over a black screen, and then, fade in: a gun fires-loudly. From here on out, the film never stops moving, cutting back and forth between three different but equally nerve-wracking narratives. If anything, the film makes us incredibly grateful we're not any of the characters, who are mostly nameless soldiers and commanders who remain determined yet are losing hope and feeling abandoned by their country, the leaders of which refuse to surrender to Germany but still commit to evacuating its 30,000 plus men from the area, although this will be no small feat. \n\nWhen we first meet the soldiers, their situations are already dire, and over the next few days, things will only get worse. On the beach, massive lines for would-be evacuation boats have formed and there's clearly not enough room for everybody. Meanwhile, bullets fly from all directions, bombs get dropped by the Luftwaffe above, and some men resort to suicide by walking out into the ocean and never coming back. \n\nThose who have chosen survival will brave conditions that are cold, wet and dark. There will also be moments when the ability to breathe isn't a guarantee and one's options are to either drown or burn. But on top of the physical hardships, there are emotional and psychological traumas, some of which stem from not feeling like you belong and/or not trusting your comrades.\n\nMany war movies recreate degrees of these situations all the time, but there's often a safe, comfortable distance between them and the viewers. \"Dunkirk\" is an exception. It's more raw and palpable. The soundtrack, photography and special effects, which are seamless, envelop us to the point where we feel like we're right there with these men, and not in a fun way. What they feel, we feel, and it's rough. We leave the theater with a legitimate sense of what it might have been like to be a soldier at Dunkirk.\n\nAmidst the madness, Nolan refrains from investing too much time in any one character, which is wise because it's clear from the beginning no one is guaranteed to survive. In fact, the people in the film aren't characters as much as faces to which we can identify the current narrative. A similar strategy was practiced by Ridley Scott in \"Black Hawk Down,\" which, like \"Dunkirk,\" was less about the people and more about how the conditions affected the people. \n\nOn land, we follow Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), who, after outrunning snipers, partners with another youth-faced soldier and attempts to use a wounded man on a stretcher as his ticket to get about a board an exiting boat. This effort, though, like many thereafter, quickly proves futile.\n\nIn the air, two spitfire pilots (Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden) make their way over Dunkirk to fend off the looming Luftwaffe, but the Englishmen are low on fuel, and they spend so much time dodging bullets themselves, their mission shifts from rescuing and protecting those to simply evading danger.\n\nWith limited resources, Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) receives word the Royal Navy has enlisted private citizens to use their own boats to make their way across the English Channel and pick up the soldiers. Nolan shows us this perspective through Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) and his son Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney), along with Peter's friend, George (Barry Keoghan). As they make their way to Dunkirk, they happen upon a traumatized soldier (Cillian Murphy), who chides Dawson for willingly taking them back into the chaos, but even after a tragedy occurs, Dawson remains steadfast in fulfilling what he believes is his duty.\n\nEven though the film constantly shifts across its multiple stories, Nolan and his longtime editor, Lee Smith, keep each narrative afloat by incorporating it with a growing sense of urgency. As the peril and exhaustion of the allies heightens, so too does the film's tension, and it's created and held so masterfully that we find our own bodies tightening up. We're with the characters as their minds race with incertitude, not knowing if they'll be able to breathe, or if they'll have enough fuel, or if their landing gear will open, or if they'll be viewed by their fellow country men and women as cowards or heroes.\n\nBy being such a convincing war film, \"Dunkirk\" invariably ends up as an \"anti-war\" film. Why? Because after seeing it, we can't imagine anyone thinking war is worth the fear, anxiety and physical misery these men faced, and even though its politics are mostly muted, we get the sense Nolan wanted to tell a story that depicted heroism but also served as a cautionary about what can happen when countries choose to violence to resolve issues. \n\nNo matter your politics or how you interpret the film's message, \"Dunkirk\" is simply breathtaking. Its sounds and visuals stir us and keeps the film's tension locked right up to the end. It didn't seem possible that Christopher Nolan's standards and abilities could beyond the high level they were already at, but \"Dunkirk\" shows he's gained a greater knowledge of how to make viewers feel they're someplace else, and even though Dunkirk is a place we don't want to be, the film allows us to recognize those who were there and what they experienced.",

When we see we must fight are way to the front to be the first to leave while others wait. When we see we must fight through the bad environmentalÃ,Â  conditions, conditions that present to us, and little we hang on to. When we see we must fight for shelter, fight to stay alive, fight to keep order, and fight to live another fight. When we see we must fight to save others, fight to regroup and plan the next step, fight our dark urges to abandon such a cause, and fight with anyone who is responsible for the way everything is. When we some wish not to fight and turn back, others face head on and do all what they can to fight and help. When we don't need to see what it's like in some war zone places to know what to expect when we have fought in our past and lost someone when fighting is in our family. When we see what we need to do to fight back to give others a fighting chance. When we see we must not fight ourselves in what we are about to do when it's our obligation to fight for what's right no matter what. When we see fighting is what we instructed to do to do it to the vary end. When we might not like what we see and fight against we only see we fight for one side, the good righteous side. When we need to see everywhere and everything when we are fighting against what is broken, what can go wrong, what little we have to work with, what little decisions making and time we have left before more lives are taken. When we see we must fight in all angles from above and below, at home and in foreign places until we get news and commands to stop. When we see we fight against our own thoughts and disceptions when we see our fight lost and we are running. When we see we must fight against everything at once, and braise for anything more to expect to fight against next when there is not much to do but wait till we are home. When we see that home fights for you to come home as you fought to make our home safe when we are all fighting the same fight. When we see all we can think about is fighting when death makes look for a fighting chance to look for exits, doors to comfort, warmth, rations and safety. When we see that we must fight through all the cloud of uncertainty, and fight to see the day of light, when we hate seeing and being trapped that we only wish to fight to stay alive. When we see we must fight our fears and keep our mind & heart strong when we fight the enemy not ourselves being the enemy. When we see there is no hope in fighting, and thete is hope in fighting for others when help comes our way. When we don't always get to see the faces whom fight for us and save our lives when we owe a great debt in their honour for fighting the way they fought and gave time back to those who returned home. When we see that's all we are meant to do, fight for our country to see it to the vary end, whatever time that maybe, when we see some responsibilities even further then what others could see us doing that makes our fight even worth more important and empowering to know we have strong fighters in the front. When we see our purpose is to fight to win, never surrender, never lose sight in what we are fighting for. When we see we try to fight to make some sense of everything, but don't need to see but hear all that hear and not take it for granted when we fight to make this world a home for all to live in peace.",

Nolan had the intelligence to keep a certain decency over that. There are no heroes or villains in this movie; the main character is the war.  Without telling the story of a single character, he managed to focus on the horror (and you really can feel the horror) that men experience during the war, but without excessive dramatization and blood. The images are amazingly beautiful.  The sound track is very efficient to keep you on the edge of your chair and in a tense state. The actors are excellent; the British actors always have something special in their way of acting. A great movie which suggests sensations, impressions, and vivid emotions. Reminds me that this kind of horror must never start again.",

            "content": "Ahh... Nolan. Who doesn't love Christopher Nolan, eh? One of the most acclaimed directors working today, a cinematic genius behind modern classics such as \"The Dark Knight\" trilogy, \"The Prestige\", \"Inception\" and \"Interstellar\"...\nWell, I hate to be a party pooper (as always), but I have never shared the mad love every other movie fan I know has to share for him. I mean, his works are a'ight, but I never found them to be as great as everybody else seemed to think.\nI guess I liked early Nolan the best - \"Memento\" and especially \"Insomnia\" -, when he was more interested in characters and building suspense than just creating the biggest baddest epics available.\nOf course, Nolan is good at creating suspense and orchestrating action setpieces, but even his best works \"Inception\" and \"Interstellar\" have suffered from being overlong and pompous. Not to mention his third and last Batman which felt like a big pompous piece of crap.\nHaving written all that, I liked \"Dunkirk\" a lot. It's not only one of the finest movies of 2017 (so far), one of the most thoughtful war dramas I've seen, and also Nolan's best yet.\nAlthough if you go to cinema expecting his usual, you may well leave disappointed, because this epic World War II tale is quite unlike anything we have come to associate him with.\nAfter all these years, it must be supremely difficult to create a war drama with something fresh to show or say.\nBut Nolan is not afraid of challenges, and he has managed to pull off a movie which is both epic and intimate, artsy and mainstream-friendly, adrenaline-filled and deep at the same time. It's what the movie lovers always wait for but rarely get: a thinking man's blockbuster.\n\"Dunkirk\" shows the experience of war from the another angle rarely seen or thought of, at least in movies. It's about human frailty, loneliness, isolation and enduring the limbo between chaos and salvation that war is made of.\nOf course, there's also enough explosions and eye-candy, but the whole thing is rather artsy in a good way. Not much dialogue or clearly defined events too, just people waiting (because there's nothing else left for them to do) and trying to survive.\nThere is not even a single clearly-defined central character, although there are several main storylines to follow, sometimes not in chronological form.\nThe story is about thousands of Allied troops surrounded by enemy forces, trapped on the beach and waiting for rescuing.\nWe have some well-known actors here, such as Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy, but it's not really an actor's movie (ie, meant to let somebody shine) but fitting everything into a carefully crafted cinematic mosaic.\nSpeaking about war part, I especially loved the flight and air battle scenes. The immediacy, the sound effects. Also the fact that they were often made from pilot's viewpoints, so it feels more realistic. The pilot shoots and we see target plane catching fire only after a while, for example.\nAll in all, Dunkirk\" is the Nolan movie that has touched me the most. It's about real things, emotions and experiences, and the action is thrillng. Another beautiful achievement for one of the most liked and successful auteurs working in mainstream cinema today.\nWatched it in IMAX which probably add something to the experience, at least from technical standpoint. But it's surely a good looking and sounding movie on any screen or setup, methinks.",

You don't get emotionally involved with the characters as you did in better done war movies like \"Saving Private Ryan\" or \"Lone Survivor\".

            "content": "I can understand where people may be coming from when they say there is a lack of character development in this film, and I can definitely see it. I cannot, however, justify the bland/boring statement. You need to understand what war is to like this movie for what it is, and some people seem to have a preconceived view where there is always a hero and always a villian, and the hero tears the enemy to shreds and saves the day, coming back home to his worried wife and/or child, and there's just a happy ending. This is NOT how war works. Everyone is vulnerable-anyone and everyone is mortal and can die if they are in the radius of a bomb or hit with a bullet, or are in a ship that's internally flooded- panic and struggle take over, not intellect of \"Ooh, how am I gonna get out of this one?\" Similarly, for character development, there isn't any for a reason- in war, do you think a commanding officer would want to get someone off the beach because he heard a story that he has a wife and family back home? If he ain't there in time, he is not getting of that boat, it would be all about getting as many people out as quickly as possible, not the people who you think are the most worthy. The film isn't character driven because it doesn't need to be- instead , it is driven by the event, the horror of war, the desperation and pushed into place by Zimmer's score. The film forces to you to not care ABOUT the characters, but BECOME them; feel and see what they feel and see: Loud and deadly gunshots, the horrific screams of the German planes engines (Which were, as a historical fact, made to crush morale,) the screams of your fellow soldiers and they die, and you can do nothing about it. I get that some people are driven by character development, but this is the most realistic and engaging view of war I personally have ever seen, and I hate to say it, but if you discount this movie based on the fact that you are too hung up on the fact that you don't know if there is a wife or family or backstory for the characters of this film, then you should reconsider your stance on how and why you view movies.",

Dunkirk is a war film that doesn't go in to the graphic carnage of war. it gives the viewer an intense edge of your seat ride with no blood or gore and to do that in this day and age just shows how movies like this can be made. split into 3 points of view the land, the sea, the air they all intertwine to make a great visually movie for an 1hr 47mins of pure entertainment",

            "content": "\"Dunkirk\" is a war movie that takes place during World War II and describes the events of evacuating Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk in northern France. The movie is told in 3 stories, representing the land, the sea and the air...\n\nThe first story tells of a young English soldier who is the only one of his battalion to survive an attack by the Germans. He eventually reaches the British Allied troops where they are awaiting evacuation on the beaches of Dunkirk.\n\nThe second story tells of a father, his son and his son's friend who travel by small boat to Dunkirk in order to assist in the evacuation. On the way, they pick up a shell-shocked soldier who had been stranded at sea and is terrified to learn that they are going to Dunkirk where the war is taking place.\n\nThe third story tells of a pair of fighter pilots who travel to Dunkirk to give air support to the troops. One of the pilots has his plane damaged in gunfire from an enemy and must ditch into the sea, leaving the other pilot to continue to Dunkirk alone with rapidly depleting fuel.\n\nAll of the stories take place at different times and cover different lengths of time, but are interwoven throughout the movie and show different character's perspectives.\n\nThough it has some big name actors (Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy), the movie doesn't rely too heavily on them. Many of the actors that play the soldiers are young and somewhat unknown. It not only allowed the movie to stand on its own without the star power, it also showed how young and inexperienced the men in the war really were.\n\nThis movie is far more action-based than dialogue-based. There is relatively little dialogue and the viewer picks up on the surrounding action and body language of the characters -- and it does it very well. The movie didn't need to be bogged down in talk. As soon as the movie starts, the viewer is thrown right into the middle of the war.\n\nThe visuals are realistically gritty and the music adds tension throughout the movie. The nonlinear storytelling and acting, both spoken and not, make this one of the most interesting war movies I've seen.\n\nHighly recommended.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan does it again. His latest, and dare I say greatest, movie is based on a true story and honors it in spectacular fashion. Dunkirk is about the true story of the Battle of Dunkirk, where thousands of British and French troops were stuck and trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk, fighting to survive while also trying to evacuate. This is a powerful story that Nolan captures beautifully. \n\nVisuals are phenomenal. From the beaches to the seas, this movie sucks you in and makes you feel like you are actually there. This feeling is only enhanced by tremendous sounds that are eerily realistic, something Nolan is known for. Hans Zimmer's score is fantastic and adds an increasing amount of suspense to an already suspenseful movie to begin with.\n\nOnly issue here is the lack of dialogue, which seems to have cut back on the emotion a little bit, although by the end of the movie you feel for what these men went through and why \"war is hell.\" Dunkirk is unique in a sense that it cuts back on the dialogue to focus on the technical side of things while being able to deliver a powerful war story about the will to survive against all odds.",

            "content": "In its own weird way this is Nolan's most experimental film to date. The combination of a clock-ticking-nearly-ceaseless soundtrack, unrelenting tension, Rashomon like story structure, sparse dialogue and breathless visual splendor, \"Dunkirk\" manages to separate itself from the typical Nolan canon and the war genre in general. Does all this equate to it being the brilliant auteurs finest work yet? I have a strong suspicion that critics would say yes, but audiences significantly more divided. Its the anti \"Saving Private Ryan\", shockingly non violent, with an emphasis on the visual ballet of aerial dog fights, the suffocating closeness of the oceans peril, and the inevitable sense of empending doom. There is no character to truly attach ones emotional gravitas to, simply because we don't spend enough time with any one of them, which may be the biggest fault in the film. The lack of memorable characters gives it a sort of hollowness, with the majority of the focus falling into the structure and visuals. I'm torn. On one hand the experience of the film is brilliant, it's intense and visceral, but on the other hand, there is no face to the enemy, no individual to invest in. It feels like the an amazing amusement ride, thrilling and relentless while you're in it but when it's over you walk away with only the experience to cling to.",

Cutting between the past and present isn't very confusing, as long as the audience is able to distinguish what's the past and what's the present. But when you have three timelines, happening at different time rates, it's nearly impossible to figure out what is going on. The ending of the film is a complete mess in this regard, but I won't go into details as to what actually happens. Maybe this would have worked better had we known the characters, and had grown attached to them. But Nolan tries something that, again, works on paper, but doesn't work on screen. He has a huge ensemble cast, without the film focusing on any one character in particular. We don't learn the backstories of any of these characters. I understand where he was coming from; in war, you don't know the story of the person fighting alongside you. You just have to make do with who and what you've got. But for a movie, that doesn't work. At least not for the way Nolan structures the film...\n\nYou can read our full review here: http://www.themovieparadise.com/2017/07/dunkirk-review-christopher-nolan-tom-hardy-harry-styles-mark-rylance-cillian-murphy-kenneth-branagh.html",

Firstly the positives; it looks great, it is well shot, the score is brilliant, the majority of the main cast is solid, the sound design is spot on and it has plenty of tense moments mixed in with the decent action scenes. Sadly the film is somewhat undermined by a lackluster script that doesn't give me any reasons to care or like the characters we follow, the whole narrative which jumps between one week, one day and one hour is good in theory but removes tension from several later scenes and makes them mostly predictable, Harry Styles is completely unremarkable and the choice to go for a more audience friendly rating makes the majority of the action no where near as intense and shocking as the incredible sound design needs to back it up. Saving Private Ryan is a far better realistic depiction of WWII in Europe and that is despite that films own flaws.",

That older movie starred Jean-Paul Belmondo and showed the events from French soldiers' point of view.  Instead of showing the many heroism s like\" Dunkirk\",  it focused on the darker sides of war. Can't really compare the two movies I guess, but you ought to see that older movie if you can find it.",
