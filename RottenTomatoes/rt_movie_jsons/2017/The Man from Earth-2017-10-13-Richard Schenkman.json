The first movie was a godsend. I still watch it from time to time, makes me think of sci-fi as the philosophical and conceptual genre that it is. What I loved most about the first movie, the simplicity with the small cast, singular location and perfectly eloquent dialogic narrative was lost here. I absolutely refuse to believe it's in any way related to the cinematic masterpiece that was the 2007 original. Please don't watch, it'll ruin your thoughts about the first movie as well. Loved the original, wish the sequel never happened. No more. Never again.",

Great acting, though more dramatic than the first Man from Earth film and too dramatic than my ideal movie. The plot pacing was really good - didn't linger too long in one scene and almost all scenes had plot purpose. Variety of characters, whose development didn't require much character focus and were instead created by a character-adding line every so often. The sound was great - background-only and defined the mood and plot pacing quite well. My only small criticism is about the heavy christ focus of this one - I'm just not a fan of youthful devout religious characters. A film-maker has to choose a plot, though, and it was a fair handling of this plot type. A well-made movie! The first Man from Earth film introduced a wild new idea, and it's impossible to continue that story while opening up another wild new idea. Well-handled indeed!",

The post credits setup for a squeal of some sort also seemed forced and disconnected from the first film thematically. \n\nOn a positive note, the final scene of the film pre-credits was very well done, and would happily fit in with the first film. The rest sadly did not live up to expectations.",

The storyline is again very unique and interesting from beginning to end.  The main reason I only rate this 3* is because the ending leaves something to be desired.",

It should have extend the religion question with such a group, but instead the movie just aim to be a thriller withouth any more content that could add more to the original material from the first Man from earth. At the end, it feels like the movie miss a good 30 minutes, and the milling of the producer to maybe make a third movie or a serie afraid me. The first movie didn't need or deserve a sequel, it was perfect like that. Please limit the damage.",

In \"Man from Earth\" the movie was really toying with the concept of an immortal while in \"Holocene\" the main point seemed to be a leaping off junction for a television series or something similar.",
