A coming of age story for those who were dealt a short hand, one that routinely explores both the darkness of loss while always bringing the story back around to mutual support and love. It's told from the perspective of children without being reductive or talking down to them, or using their young age as a way to write off their suffering. Picking apart details like the quick turnaround of your archetypal 'bully' character would almost feel like a disservice to the final product, which takes heavy concepts and presents them in a charming way to disarm you.

And yet, despite all that, it manages to stay optimistic (not unlike its characters) and, sometimes, wholesome even. It is not a movie I would show to the youngest of audiences, but for teenagers it can be, I imagine, quite a lesson on how to find happiness even in dire condition (in other people, in short), and it is now, after all, quite a timely problem, with all this cases of depression and such, especially among our youth. I have a feeling that this particular story may stay with some spectator for a longer while, and it is certainly a good thing.",

            "content": "It's been said more than a few times that we are in a golden age of animation. These sort of claims are hard to assess when we're in the middle of the time being talked about - we lack perspective; and animation isn't a medium I pay a huge amount of attention to for the simple reason that the most talked about animated films tend not to get released very widely (or at all) in South Africa). \n\nStreaming services are making it easier, though, and finally catching up with 2016's My Life As A Zucchini/Courgette (delete according to your location) was a joy. It's a short (65 minutes) Swiss stop-motion animation about an orphaned boy (who calls himself Courgette), sent to a home for foster children. The film (I watched an English language version - with an excellent voice cast - though I understand subtitled original language versions are available) tells the story of how building relationships with other orphans and adults, how they listen to each other's stories of trauma and learn to grow in trust.\n\nIt would have been easy to go in one of two directions with this story: the one being a twee, saccharine affair that would be ill-fitting the serious subject matter; the other unbearably sad. That the film is neither is remarkable. The animation provides a sense of otherness that allows us to enter into the experience of the children with our defences down; the decision to portray them with wide, expressive eyes redolent of the human impulse to project on to children the innocence we wish we still had as adults. \n\nAs a foster parent myself, I know full well the desire to fix the problems of the children in my care; and how those around me seem to think that foster children have no different problems to 'normal' children - and that somehow 'just' loving them will be enough to bring healing. This far from the truth - you can't just fix a human being, and no amount of love is going to undo trauma in the formative years of a person's life. The film knows this, and wisely portrays the other traumatised children as the best people to bear the burdens with a traumatised child. It's not that there isn't a role for parent or therapist or teacher, of course - it's simply that only a child who has been there can truly enter in to the pain of a child with these experiences. \n\nThe film is full of deeply moving little details - the child who runs outside shouting 'Mummy?' every time a car pulls up; the way children in these situations can end up feeling like pieces moved around a board they can't see the whole of; very realistically, the children here are shown as repeatedly and forcefully trying to assert their own agency. \n\nThere's a danger in the film's ending of the implication that once the children find a reconstituted family situation of some sort, that all will be well. To conclude that would not be in keeping with what had gone before; but the implication could have been more clearly avoided. Otherwise this is a tender, funny, beautiful film that avoids clich\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 (C)d tear-jerking to tell a story that is truthful and repeated all over the world every day. As a charming and striking viewing in its own right, or as an insight in to the world of fostering children, this is well worth seeking out.",

Another big part of the film makes characters straight out say \"this sad story happened to me. In fact, Zucchini straight out asks Simon, \"hey what's Camilia's deal? why is she here?\"(26:27-27:12) not too long after Simon went over everyone else's backstory(18:06-19:36.)  I do enjoy the backgrounds, they are the best I've seen in a while. For instance, at the start of the film, you get a white wall filled with Zucchini's drawings in a small cramped attic(as to set-up his love for drawing and how bad his mom treats him). Really, even if you don't want to see the movie, look up the backgrounds in it, that was my favorite part of the film. \n\nP.S the elongated arms reminded me of \"Little Nightmares\", it was not cute",

I didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t anticipate how unique it would be in its animation and characters. The movie truly had a great presentation. I really felt the tone of the movie, and I was never bored well watching it. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s a simple, animated, French film. It wasn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t clear what the goal of the movie was, but I definitely got something out of it.\n\tThe plot is simplistic and nothing to extravagant. I like Marvel movies. I liked the book Ready Player One. But at the end of the day, I care about presentation more than action. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s why blockbusters don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t sit right with me. But My Life as a Zucchini has an easy-to-follow plot, and it works with the tone of the movie. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s challenging, and though the plot is only average, it sets everything up so that the characters shine.\n\tThe protagonist is a 9-year-old boy named Icare, but his nickname is Zucchini. His mother is an abusive alcoholic, and one day she is about to beat him, but he accidentally knocks her down the stairs, killing her. Zucchini is sent to an orphanage, and as one might expect, Matilda shenanigans occur. Zucchini has a cop that visits him every week or two, and the orphanage owners are caring. All the kids have tragic backstories. But Zucchini feels shy. One kid, presented as a bully at first, is named Simon. He picks on Zucchini, trying to get him to open up. Eventually, Simon is revealed to be much more complex, and it seems all the kids get along.\nOne day, another kid comes, and Zucchini develops a crush on her. The girl, Camille makes everybody at the orphanage happier, even getting the archetypal emo kid to be more social. But Camille has an abusive aunt that she lives with over the weekends. The aunt wants to take full custody of her, because she pays less taxes if she is takes Camille in. One weekend Camille goes over to stay with her aunt, and Simon gives her a recording device. Her tells her to record her aunt saying something incriminating. When the judge decides whether or not Camille will stay with her aunt, Camille plays a recording that gives the judge reason not to let the aunt take custody.\nThe movie ends with the cop that visits Zucchini every week adopting Zucchini and Camille. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s very abrupt, and the plot is probably the worst thing about the movie. The main deterrent for me was how the plot goes too fast. I was never bored during the movie, but when the movie ended I was also confused. It didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t seem like much was resolved because the pacing was off. Half of the movie was just the first act, and the main conflict, the abusive aunt, only shows up 37 minutes into the movie, and is resolved 15 minutes later. The resolution takes about 7 minutes, and the movie ultimately suffers from this lack of pacing.\nHowever, the plot and pacing are the only bad things about this movie. The best thing is the characters. Simon is the most complex, and it is interesting to see the affect Camille had on the orphanage as a whole. Zucchini is a good character as well, starting as an outsider in the group of kids, but soon being absorbed into the culture of the orphanage. Simon is the character I focused most on while watching the movie. His backstory is that his parents did drugs, and were caught by the police. At first he teases Zucchini, saying he looks more like a potato than a zucchini. But he becomes Zucchini\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s friend, and Zucchini finds that the orphanage is a tight-knit group of friends. But Simon is hard to read. He tries to be supportive of his friends, and he\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s oddly mature for his age. But he often suppresses his own emotions so his friends can be happy. At the end of the movie, when the cop offers to adopt Zucchini and Camille, he is angry about it, but he eventually comes around and tells them that they should take the opportunity, and this moment shows his stance as a friend. He sort of represents the entire orphanage, being each other\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s friends, because who needs friends more than a bunch of orphans in the middle of nowhere?\nAnother interesting feature of My Life as a Zucchini was the animation. The movie is clay stop motion, which is impressive in itself. In addition, the shadows could not look more realistic. But what really stood out was the angles and shots. No scene is to close up, and there are plenty of creative angles. For instance, at 3 minutes and 29 seconds into the movie, there is a shot that really set the tone for the movie well, with Zucchini walking away from the room his sad, lonely mother was in, out of solitude, and up the stairs, rising to his aspiration. In addition to the cinematography and layout, the lighting is really something, especially considering everything is made of clay.\nThe entire film is a true beauty, and the only thing it could have benefitted from is if the plot were better paced. The movie is a great character study. I was interested in all the characters, from the caring orphanage caretakers to the fun-loving and charismatic Camille. If I were to rate it out of 10 I would give it a 6. The movie is good overall, but the plot is all over the place, which would make it hard to sit through a second time. Even so, it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s free on Netflix, and worth a watch.",

Despite a brisk runtime of just over an hour, the movie manages to take a relaxed pace to allow to explore the unique and colorful children of an orphanage as they explore the loss of their parents and find love and friendship.  The cast of characters is a strong point in the movie, as each child in the orphanage has unique quirks and vulnerabilities, from the titular Icare, who prefers the nickname courgette given to him by his alcoholic mother, to Simon, who picks on new children until he can discover their backstory, to side characters like Beatrice, who runs to the door expecting her deported mother to return at every passing car.  The art design is also a strong point, as the clay characters are made with emphasis on sunken, shaded eyes and Rudolph-red noses, reflecting the subtle sadness weighing on these characters as they look to find family and childhood wonder despite trauma and abandonment.  Add in a predictable but heart-warming plot, and you have a truly special movie that I'm glad to have stumbled upon.",

Once there the film explores the struggles of Courgette and the other children there and how he eventually finds love and friendship.\nThe whole story is told from a child's perspective and is very effective in doing so. The language and dialogue between the children is very realistic and believable and the sometimes blunt but ordinary way that some topics are discussed aren't given the usually Hollywood melodrama. The animation style of this film is also very charming. The models and settings have a cartoonish, childish feel to them as though this is how Courgette envisions the world but are able to convey a wealth of emotion and realism when dealing with a difficult topic. Although the film is quite dark at points it balances this out nicely with genuinely uplifting and sweet moments. This film absolutely flies by at only 70mins long but it certainly isn't lacking anything in its short run time. \nThe English voice acting is also excellent. Erick Abbate and Ness Krell are great as Courgette and Camille. Nick Offerman also gives a great, understated performance as Raymond, I kindly police officer who is sympathetic towards Courgette's situation. \nAll in all this is a very simplistic, enjoyable film that will pull at your heartstrings but leave you with a warm, uplifted feeling of joy.",

(There's also an English remake in which the boy's name is \"Zucchini\", which seems a lot worse.)\n\nCourgette is an imaginative kid who lives with his beer-swilling mom until such point that he's abruptly orphaned and a kindly policeman brings him to the orphanage that will be his new home. There he meets a group of similarly-damaged kids who spend the remainder of the 66 minute running time being happy and sad and mean and kind and generally acting like regular kids trying to make the best of their unfortunate situations.\n\nThis movie is heartbreaking one minute and uplifting the next. There are sad scenes like when the newly-orphaned Courgette clings to the only memento he has of his mother -- an empty beer can. And there are joyous scenes like an overnight ski trip with a dance party. The fact that the movie is voiced by actual children lends it an air of credibility and poignancy.  \n\nThough this is a movie ABOUT kids, it's definitely not a movie FOR kids. Not only are there graphic discussions in which the kids' share their misinformed notions about sex, there are also the orphans' own grim backstories. Heed my advice or brace yourself for an awkward discussion in the car ride home. \n\nIf you see this (and if you're not a little kid, you definitely should), stick around for the credits.

Part of the magic lies in the gentle rhythm of the editing, eschewing quick cuts for unfashionably lengthy takes, lingering upon tiny reactions - a blink here, a shrug there - through which the real story unfolds. The landscapes in which these children live may be full of shadows, but the use of bold colours - red, blue, brown, yellow - adds a bright spark of defiance to their characters.",

It's a downright bizarre looking film, with characters whose body mass is roughly 80% head, and a very bright colour palette. It doesn't have the greatest of impacts, partly with it only being an hour long, but you grow to like and appreciate its characters, seeing very real drama in their massive eyes, and its told with a mostly upbeat sensibility so it never becomes wearisome. They start out rather bland and stock, and while not all of them get a chance to flourish, the ones who do will easily win you over. It won't be my first choice if I'm reaching for an animated flick in the near future, but I'd happily watch it again if given the chance.",

The narrative is arguably a tad simplistic and over-optimistic, but at just over an hour long, it is a succinct and life affirmingly positive film that uses nothing but clay and a lot of heart to wonderful effect.",

Yes this is, without doubt, a lot more than some fun little short, as it packs more emotion and meaning than many films double its run-time, and delivers it all in a way that feels perfectly paced and balanced at the same time. Seriously, not a scene here is rushed or dragged out, yet the humanity of the characters and story is such that you wouldn't even mind if it was, as they hook you into the whole experience extremely tightly indeed. For that, huge credit should of course be given to the brilliant direction and voice acting, but it would also be criminal to not mention the animation itself which is just as charming and beautiful as the film that it brings to life.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: It is perhaps true that the tough reality is a little too delicately expressed, but then brutality isn't really the idea here.\nVRRDICT: A beautiful, heartfelt and touching film that captures more of the magic of film in 66 minutes than most others manage in 200.

The nature of the production allows the disturbing script to deal with sensitive problems that might be off-putting in a live action movie.

The circumstances are many: some have passed on, others arrested, deported, or maybe they have just simply abandoned them.  It's a heartwarming tale that doesn't sugarcoat the toughest thing a youngster may ever have to face. Yet somehow kids manage to weather the tribulations that life throws at them.  The narrative delves into the need for a child, and anyone really, to feel loved. My Life As A Zucchini received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature Film well before it was even available in theaters.

As someone who has been through the adoption process, watching it from this perspective was heartbreaking and revealing. It really explores all of the stuff that I could only imagine, perhaps most powerfully the choice that Zucchini must eventually make to leave the only friends he knows behind for a new family that remains uncertain.

            "content": "Sometimes I wonder how the Academy decides upon nominees for Best Animated Feature. There are always these foreign films that get nominated in the category but never have a chance of winning because the voters go with the most popular choice, so how do they come across something like this little gem? The beautiful textures in My Life as a Zucchini aren't limited to the onscreen animation; the textures of the script are personified with the visuals. The humor, heart, and melancholia of the storytelling makes this an unusually honest movie, and even if it isn't quite for children, it's for families regardless. Icare is a nine-year-old child whose father has passed and whose mother is an alcoholic. She calls him Zucchini (or Courgette, as is the term in Europe, hence the original French title Ma vie de Courgette), and after her death, he is taken away to an orphanage where he meets several other kids with similar domestic issues. He forms relationships with them, mostly a bully named Simon and a girl that he has a crush on named Camille, being regularly visited by a police officer named Raymond with whom he shares a father-son connection. The movie is commendable in how it treats these characters, ranging from the accuracy of their na\u00efvet\u00e9 to the shadings of emotions that they deal with and often share. It has a PG-13 rating here in the United States and it's well founded, given the movie's discussions of domestic abuse and suicide in addition to the kids' hilariously stilted attempts at explaining sex and pregnancy to each other. We don't get an explanation in this movie about storks delivering babies but instead talk about how men's willies explode while the women shout affirmative words such as \"yes\" over and over. Director/co-writer Claude Barras and co-writers C\u00e9line Sciamma, Germano Zullo, and Morgan Navarro look at the world through the eyes of these children-they know how things are supposed to be, but they don't at all know the answers. The results are funny and sad in realistic ways without falling back on exploiting audience sympathy. All of these moments make for a package that is as colorful as the characters, and with the film's 66-minute runtime, it goes by quickly and the arcs feel organic. One might fear that it would feel rushed narratively, but the pacing here is very well controlled. The only issues with My Life as a Zucchini stem from the peripheral characters, who feel like placeholders most of the time. Despite all of the characters having their little quirks, some of them don't really do much and it makes the movie feel a little imbalanced in terms of depth. Regardless, this is one of the very best movies of 2017 so far and the best nominee for Best Animated Feature this past awards season, above Kubo and the Two Strings. It's a storybook of warmth and craftsmanship, being cute without ever grating on you. You'll want to hug your parents and friends. 8.8/10, terrific, A-, far above average, etc.",

So thankful I got to see it today at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. This is Switzerland's entry for Best Foreign Language Film for the Oscars. I hope it gets that nomination AS WELL as Best Animated Film. Beautiful stop motion film. Can't believe this is Director Claude Barras first film! Done so well. I love stop motion animation. Cute moments. The script was amazing. Beautiful story. It was dark but still had a good balance of funny. It was also very touching. Got me teary-eyed lol. This movie broke my heart then uplifted me. Love love loved it. The music was great as well. It was only a little over an hour long so I wish it was longer lol. Loved being around this group of kids. I loved the language as well. French is so beautiful & I'm so in love with it. The movie translated is called My Life as a Zucchini. Also seen it called My Life as a Courgette. I'm not sure I will find it on Blu Ray here but I'm hoping I can get it at least digitally cause I NEED to own this. These characters will stay with me for a long time.",
