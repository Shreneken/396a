            "content": "Ok, I'm going to be honest here. I'm a big fan of the franchise. I have both movies, and have rewatched them over the years. This is my favorite franchise. I've waited 14 years for this. 2 is my favorite, I saw it before 1. It was scary and wowed me. This brings me to tonight. I'm not a professional movie critic, I'm just a regular movie goer. I saw the 1 night showing. I was pumped. I left disappointed but optimistic. The Creeper is back! We know what he's all about. What was odd is this movie picked up after Jeeper's Creepers 1. What?! It should've picked up after part 2. Rememebr Ray Wise looking 23 years older sitting in the Barn?? Made no sense... Also how do you explain the hawk like talons in part 2 vs him wearing boots in parts 1 & 3?? They set out to hunt him down and expose his origins. Well they literally gave 2 crumbs about his origin (which I know they're saving for the next installment but still), so that's a negative. I thought the makeup (& crows) were not as good as prior installments. He didn't look as scary as he did in parts 1 and 2. The Creeper seemed to be bulked up, was he wearing shoulder pads?! Also he moved at supersonic speeds. Slow him down in the next movie. It took the fun out of things, it really did. I get it, but all the old 50's pickup trucks are just getting old and annoying to see, this is the 3rd installment. You just don't end a movie like that. I literally sat there like, oh no, they are not going to end it here, they can't! Oh & they did end it there after 5 minutes or so. This movie lacked killing & removing or eating body parts. Where was all the terror man?? That's what the Creeper is known for, and that's what we want to see. They normally try to set things up first, and that's what it seemed they were doing. This was very disappointing. I hate to say it but this almost seemed to be a B level movie. Like Wrong Turn 3, 4, etc. Back to the ending. Bad move, but I know what Victor is doing. He's setting up the next installment which I think will get back to the Creeper ways we are all familiar with. Sorry but this movie appeared to be low budget. With all that has gone on I understand that. He has to be better with the next installment. He needs some high level backers with deep pockets. This next installment cannot come out straight to DVD 10 years from now. That just won't work. They did good things like letting us see how he operates, his truck, some backstory about the prom couple from the first movie. It appears he's (Victor)doing an Alien type of jumping around with the storyline.",

However haters want to describe it unfortunately for you the fourth which got pushed back is on its way this year after the lockdown and so the movies can't be as bad as the uninterested would imply. \n\nThe third in question was shot in broad day might mostly, which was intended to be scary, eerie with more memorable horror moments. This time they battle the Creepers by eventually forming a last minute plot to kill it, the problem not being the characters impetuousness does not happen as fast or effective as it should or takes too long with the needless dialogue, the problem instead is actually they lost the intensity, the hairs on neck raising horror factor the original had and therefore instead of the wow factor what we got was more like a low budget college made version someplace they have fields and weird looking teens. \n\nHopefully the fourth will be better suited to what the usual horror marathon quick to judge keyboard warriors will approve of. Actually the fact of the matter is we needed a better film as the concept and fear factor didn't come off this time but the movie isn't quite as bad as people would describe.

Here's why: Part 1 was slow but very good as we waited to see this horrendous monster demon shut down this small town. But this film was released in like 2002 or 2003 during a time when monsters this graphic, athletic, and physically crafted to look so real were rare. Since the creature from the black lagoon there hasn't been anything like the terrifying thing from Jeepers Creepers. Back then, when he was finally revealed in the movie we were floored. It's like seeing Satan himself, or at least what we imagine an evil creature like JC might look like. It was crazy to learn this demon reptilian only visits this town for the body parts he needs or feels a desire for from a desired few - disgusting - like \"eyeballs.\" He only gets 24 hours to get it done, day or night. So by now in part 3 we know what he looks like and how truly intimidating this creature is when he finds his target. While the actors in this film were kind of bad, I think a few of them did the best they could to meet the demands of this script. Mainly, a lot of dumb faces, long pauses, and ridiculous situations transpired from the very beginning but it is still good. This movie doesn't waste any time, assuming we already know it's been 23 years and this beast is back to finish what he started the last time he was released from Hell in part 2. I like that they pushed us right into the story line.There are some  well done kill scenes from the very start. I don't want to give away any spoilers but let's just say this creature can throw a blade, dagger, and even a heavy ass steel/sharp pole for miles. His truck is made from elements he must have brought with him from another dimension. You don't want to be the person he's coming after at no time. 99% of the time there is no way to beat or get away from this thing once it sees you. It is strong, fast, intuitive, has supernatural hearing and sense of smell, and it can fly - so you're basically f*ck'd. There's a scene when he's wanting the girl and after approaching the truck she's terrified and trapped staring at him with her crush behind her just as terrified, and the thing peeks at them through the foggy, bloody glass with one eye. He begins to record her scent with a deep inhale. At this point there is a close up of his gill like upper nostril - it was so weird and intense. Try not to miss that well done scene. It's fast. Part 3 is a continuation so try not to storm into this without seeing the classic part 1 and the follow up part 2. I definitely jumped in my seat a few times. Jeepers creepers is still creepy af.

            "content": "When Jeepers Creepers first came out in 2001, I was surprised I enjoyed it to the extent that I did. Noe of the factors contributing to that assessment was how it was able to break several standard expectations that are typical of slasher movies.one of the most glaring examples is that the movie started with a young man and woman driving along a Florida road. They are on spring break, and the understandable expectation is that before the first attack they are going to hook up. With a pair of attractive young people, sex is inevitable. The twist inserted was that they were brother and sister. Unfortunately, this installment suffers from the well-documented effect known as diminishing returns. Each successive movie in a franchise has a substantial chance of less acceptance from the audience and critical community. By the time of this third offering, the level of originality has been reduced to a glimmer of the original film and even its first sequel. At the broadest level, this is a variation of the supernatural slasher flick with the popular variation of the activity cycle. The menace, aptly named, the Creeper, awakens every 23rd spring to hunt for organs from humans to replace its own old or damaged ones. His active period is 23 days and as he is an ancient demon he has had considerable opportunity to perfect methodology. Although existing from the dawn of time, the Creeper can adapt utilizing current technology. His current preferred method of hunting relies on a truck with a cow catcher on the front bumper and a body that is bulletproof. It looks like an old clunker, but it can reach speeds of 100 mph. The attachment at the front is useful for plowing through roadblocks and overturning the cars of potential meals. Gearheads will note the truck is a 1941 Chevrolet cabover truck that is short and squat in appearance. This juxtaposition of familiar tropes and anachronistic contrivance was a substantial part of the appeal the franchise developed with its fans.\n\nThe time span of this opus occupies the events between the first film and Part 2, the prequel. Dubbed an 'interquel' by some, it is intended to fill out the events immediately after Part 2 and clarify how the connect to the main storyline. One potential plus in favor of this unusual placement for s third movie in a trilogy is that the same filmmaker wrote and directed all three installments to date, Victor Salva. This helps a nascent franchise to establish a coherent and contiguous canon, particularly crucial now that even the casual fan has access to a myriad of commentary forums and Wikia sites. A perennial favorite is always expanding on inconsistencies. Working against any hope of a successful third movie is the numerous reports that the script had been retooled several times effectively completely altering most aspects of the story. Just to clarify that point. The use of 'effectively' is not intended to imply that any aspect of the screenplay is an effective way to relate a cognizant narrative to the audience. Rather the script was quite effective in further degrading the downward spiral of quality that began in the sequel.it is a regrettable trend that afflicts too many horror films. Originally, the film was to be titled, 'Jeepers Creepers: Cathedral' taking place during the next feeding cycle after the original, 23 years later. From the notes I've read about this concept is could have had the potential to extend the story in a less contrived fashion and be better suited to entertaining the fans. By attempting the squeeze, another movie between the prequel and original the amount of new material was severely limited. This is due to the constraint of having to revisit characters and circumstances and manufacture some excuse to revisit old territory.\n\nThe movie opens in medias res with a frantic chase. A man is fleeing for his life barely avoiding being hit with a shuriken. Just as he reaches the road the Creeper (Jonathan Breck), swoops down, grabs him and flies off. A man is watching from his car where he watches the gruesome scene. The terror is punctuated by a hand falling from above. The lawman that believes in the supernatural, Sheriff Dan Tashtego (Stan Shaw) is on the case trying to find some way to stop the creature's feeding frenzy assisted by the beautiful Latina Deputy Dana Lang (Joyce Giraud). The truck used by the Creeper is located but it is protected by a plethora of booby traps such as death metal spikes that are propelled out from the truck's body at the first indication of tampering. This has always been one of the weakest plot contrivances of the franchise. The creature is ancient, yet it is heavily dependent upon twentieth-century technology. It obviously an old Ford truck for transportation, not when flight, at a respectable rate of speed, is an option. That aerial prowess allows for blitz attacks that carry off the organ donor/dinner in a fraction of a second.In the other films, especially the first, better level of the performances and much more coherent screenplay were able to minimize the distractions created by borderline ridiculous tropes. The question hangs in midair, what methods were used by the Creeper before the advent of the internal combustion engine.\n\nOne of the human searchers has a machine gun mounted on his truck in something that could have been borrowed from an episode of the 'A-Team' or a 'Mad Max' movie. A slasher movie frequently can come across as tongue in cheek or darkly humorous. Many of the most enduring slash and dash franchises have become famous for the comments made by the witty antagonist such as the groan-inducing puns that are such a significant part of what fans of 'Nightmare on Elm Street' so entertaining about Freddie Kruger. The Creeper is the silent killer type but his trick out truck as in some fashion an evil Bond car loaded with all manner of deadly surprises. I have been a fan of the actress Meg Foster for a substantial portion of cinematic fascination. With her uniquely piercing blue eye Ms. Foster has been a journeywoman actress for decades including one of the best alien invasion/socio-political thrillers of all time, 'They Live.' Here she portrays Gaylen Brandon, a woman with a psychic link to the Creeper. She discovers a sack containing the severed hand of the demon. When Gaylen touch it, she immediately fell into a hypnotic state. When she revives, she informs the Sheriff that the hand contains secrets about the Creeper's origins, the third film in a trilogy is often a reasonable place to include the requisite exposition of the creature's origin, but this method of revelation was forced and contributed to the already overly convoluted storyline. The fourth installment is in the works. I hope it is better, but I'm not very confident that will be the case.",

We are left with a lot of noisy gurning.  The dialogue, where do we start.  If that round faced cry baby of a sheriff says 'Goddammit' one more time I'll have to smash my TV.  It's cliche ridden throughout.  'putting rubber to the road' was another awful shoehorned in piece of rubbish script.  I had the impression they came up with this line they tried to think up a movie to use it in.\n\nThe CGI was laughable.  The scenes where actors drove cars, and there was lot of them, were even worse.  Clearly filmed on the cheap in studios with the CGI scenery making no sense and the drivers steering one way as the road behind goes another.\n\nThe creeper, a standout scary dude from the first film has now morphed into a 2 dimensional joke in this film and the addition of bizarre new superpowers does nothing to salvage the sinking wreck of a film that need never have been made.\n\nThere are a few reviews on here hailing this film as wonderful but frankly you should question what film they were watching as it certainly wasn't this travesty.",

The cop actor was a terrible actor in general.\n\nI get that all movies have some of those 'Well, that's convenient for the plot/situation\", but this movie was so chock full of those and they were so bad...\n\nThere were also so many \"Why didn't they just do this?\" and \"That doesn't make any damn sense\" moments. There were so many cringey \"Wow that was lame\" moments. (Most of all, when he finds the corny sign in the field and he falls to his knees and howls).\n\nA few of the CGI scenes were so awful. \n\nThe characters encounter a plot device that reveals things to the protagonists. It's stupid, because why would it work that way? No amount of backstory could explain that. \n\nTo make matters worse with that, it makes you so eager to learn about what the plot device revealed. Then at the end of the movie, you're left with your hands in the air like the Jackie Chan meme, because you never find out. You don't tease a plot device like that and then not deliver. \n\nMost of all, the most upsetting thing was how they portrayed the demon. His personality was different and suddenly he was so outgoing and humanly animated instead of sneaky & cunning and demon-like. He wasn't scary or foreboding, nor was there any point of the movie that has you freaked out or nervous. \n\nTo add another layer to the \"Oh it gets worse\" cake, the movie plays around with the timeline of the scenes and you can't seem to figure what is happening when. It's like, they tried to tear a page out of \"Saw III\" and failed. Then at the end, you realize this isn't really what you thought it was going to be. \n\nMy wife & I were eager to watch what happens when the demon wakes up while hung up in front of the old man in the barn. (You know, at the end of the second movie). We were expecting a continuation of that and instead we got some Jeepers Creepers 1.5 low-budget trash. \n\nThis wasn't a horror movie. It was just a corny slasher movie that should be in the B-rated movie section of your local used DVD store by now.",

The Creeper returns, as does Jonathan Breck playing The Creeper, with series writer/director Victor Salva recounting the events between the first two films, which involves a small town sheriff and a team of Creeper Hunters led by Stan Shaw taking down this flesh and blood urban legend. I think what I like most about this series is that it's basically a straightforward monster movie set-up, but each film stands apart from the one preceding it. The first film was more of a creepy \"Children of the Corn\" like rural urban legend story. The second film was more of an action packed horror suspense film. This third film combined those two elements, adding onto the lore surrounding The Creeper while also providing a number of suspenseful and scary action set pieces. The budget on \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" is noticeably smaller than the previous films, but it's nonetheless an effective horror film that's filled with suspense, action, and send-a-chill-up-your-spine horror imagery. It's also a lot of fun to see the return of the BEATINGU truck driven by The Creeper from the first film. Overall, the third entry is not as frightening as the first film and is not as large of scale as the second film, and is easily the weakest of the three, but it's still a wildly fun horror film for genre fans.",

I also believe it opened an extraordinary opportunity for a fourth movie with no limitations. No, we didnt learn where the creature came from, and no it wasn't 23 years after the second one. It made the first two movies make more sense, put them together. Anyone who is an ACTUAL fan of Jeepers Creepers is going to appreciate this film, and want more. Cliff hanger ending so hopefully we will get a fourth. The fourth can go any direction from this point, since at the end of the third the 23 days have surely ended. 23 years later anything can happen, amazing opportunity for directors and writers!",

            "content": "I often wonder how many things from my past I have forgotten as I've gotten older.  And I'm not even talking about repressed memories, of which I'm sure I have some.  I'm talking about events from my youth that may have slipped my mind.  Happy moments, sad moments, tense moments.  Perhaps I may have forgotten old toys that I used to love playing with.  There's probably a shit-ton of movies that I have seen that I've forgotten about to this day.  There's a point to this.  Let us get to it, shall we?  The point is that it has been seventeen years since the release of the original Jeepers Creepers and fifteen since its sequel.  2017 was the date of the release the third installment in this 'cult classic'.  That's a shitload of time between movies.  I'm certain that the first two movies have an established fanbase that loves these two movies, though I'm perplexed as to why, exactly, they love these movies.  I remember seeing the original in theaters when I was 13 years old.  I am now 30 years old.  If the idea for this movie was to bring in new fans to this franchise, then I'll tell you right now, they chose THE worst way possible to introduce people to this world and its characters.  This isn't so much Jeepers Creepers 3 as much as it is Jeepers Creepers 1.5.  What you're watching is the events that took place between the first and second installments in the franchise.  Talk about misleading.  If the world really needed another sequel to Jeepers Creepers and, let's be honest, it didn't, why would you choose to make it a continuation of the first one and not a standalone sequel that didn't require any knowledge of the series?  Talk about an incredibly stupid and shortsighted decision.  You're thrown into the events of this film expected to know absolutely everything, right down to the smallest detail, of what happened in the previous movie(s).  Who in the actual fuck cares about serialization (this isn't Breaking Bad) in a stupid, B-tier slasher flick?  Watching this movie only makes sense if you watch it exactly after watching the first one and it's a bit jarring seeing the actor who plays Davis (Brandon Smith) look so old, when the events here are supposed to be taking place exactly after the original.  Like how do you not even think about this prior to making the decision to stick with a timeline when it's almost TWO decades after the first movie came out.  Idiocy.  I know The Creeper (what an appropriate name for the villain, given that the writer/director of this film was convicted of sexual abuse of a minor and possession of child pornography in 1988, the year I was born) is supposed to appear once every 23 years on the 23rd day, so you have a limited timeframe to work within if you wanna tell your story.   But just say that he broke this part of the curse or something, so he can appear whenever he wants.  It doesn't fucking matter, it's a shitty sequel to a substandard horror franchise.  I doubt that the hardcore fans are so hardcore enough that they'd be legitimately annoyed at this retcon of Jeepers Creepers \"lore\".  On top of that, the Creeper inspires no actual fear.  He's just not an effective villain.  He's just a guy wearing a really cool-looking wrestling mask.  Another one of the major problems of the film is the fact that, in reality, this isn't actually much of a horror movie.  It's a movie about our 'heroes' trying to put a stop to the Creeper before he kills again.  I didn't wanna see that shit.  I wanted to see the Creeper kill some stupid teenagers doing stupid things.  That's, theoretically, what everyone wanted to see from this sequel.  Nope.  That's not the movie you got.  I don't wanna call this an action film, because calling this an action film would be like calling Titanic a surrealist thriller, it's just not.  But it's close enough to it that the horror elements are completely negated.  The Creeper does kidnap some people and kills them, but most of them leave it the gorier details.  Like, for example, he'd throw something like a javelin and kill two teens at the same time, javelin going through them both, but you'd just see the aftermath.  The only thing that could have made this movie better, the gore, was left almost all to the imagination.  And the gore that is there is so, so, SO tame that you wonder why they even bothered.  The special effects are horrendous.  They're kept to a minimum, but they're still really fucking bad.  And I understand that the film, really, had a very low-budget, but work to your strengths.  Don't use the money that you DO have to pay for special effects that are downright laughable.  The acting.  Boy, where do I even start?  Let's just say that it's really fucking bad, everyone here is hamming it up to the tenth degree.  I will say that this movie is obviously not meant to be taken super seriously.  And I will be honest when I say that the movie did make me laugh.  It wasn't because there was any sort of comedy, but its badness did bring me a few chuckles.  I think that's why the movie gets one star.  I'll take the positives where I can take them with this shitshow.  But the fact that the film was designed to not be taking seriously is still no excuse to produce such a terrible movie.  How about you make somewhat of an effort to produce a quality horror movie instead of just doing what's easiest.  In theory, you could say that they made an effort with the timeline they chose, that just counts on the surface.  The content of the movie itself is what matters.  And that content, in my opinion, was largely terrible.  Shitty acting, nonexistent horror, awful storytelling does not a good movie make.  If you're a hardcore fan, maybe you can get something out of this, but I just didn't like this at all.  The few laughs that it did provide are not worth wading through mostly shit for.",

I was really looking for to the third installment to Jeepers Creepers. I thought the first movie was scary and seeing the creeper for the first time was thrilling. The second film was okay; it lacked scares with more body count deaths. The third film is just boring, the creeper is not as scary, and the plot is an example of terrible lazy script writing. The plot follows right after the events of the first movie and just before the second movie. Where the sheriffs in the small town are shocked by what they saw. The demonic looking creature known as the creeper. They are learning the creepers motives, as it eats every 23rd spring before it goes back to hibernation for another 23 years. And this creature is unstoppable as it replaces its own body parts from the victims he eats. This film feels like a in between transition from the two movies. Which provides nothing new to what we already know with the creeper. It introduces us to some teens and young adults that mess around with the creepers beat up truck. And they get caught as prey from the creature. The script writing is pure lazy, were the plot is just horrible. We see a farm lady, were her son was killed from the creature 23 years ago, and learns that the arm that the son buried is the key to stopping the creature. Or is it? The film spends most of the time with the police and sheriff debating and figuring out what this creature is and how to kill it. And it gets very boring from here. Then, there are four teenagers that mess around with the creepers truck and hunted down by the creeper. And we have an abused young teen that lives with her grandmother and is also hunted down by the creeper. This film also lacked scares. There were no thrills or jump scares. Unless you find seeing the creeper running after someone with his odd looking axe or coming for an attack from flying. There was also no character development, making the characters even difficult to care or even know these characters name in the movie which you don't. The shock factor was there for the first movie. Maybe because you see a guy that looks and dresses in a dirty trenchcoat. And driving a beat up truck and finding out it is no man but a creeper. And looking like a demonic beast that never dies. It was all there for the first movie which made it scary. The element of surprise with the creeper is gone with this film which does not add anything to provide scares. Overall, Jeepers Creepers 3 is a bad horror film. The direction and script is terrible and lacked everything from scares, plot, and character development. It was boring mostly. I rate the film 2 out of 5 stars. I would not recommend the film unless you're bored than wait for it on tv or rental.Disappointing and boring!!! You would not miss much with a plot that offers nothing new.",

From slow reactions to drawn out scenes, it felt like pulling teeth for them to reveal what's going on. \n\nThe one thing and only thing I like about it is that it gives the first movie a nod and adds to the story.\n\nI really wanted to like it and take it for what it is but terrible writing, directing, and casting (for a few characters).",

I was disappointed in the lack of focus on the storyline itself.  To often this movie just loses its focus and more attention is put to the cheesy CGI effects.  Anytime you can watch a scene and can predict what is going to happen before it happens then the director has not met expectations.  In particular when the two people were still alive in the truck and tried to figure out how to get out of the truck without falling prey to a boobie trap; one of the people attempts to open the front door but before doing so the director already sets up the death scene by showing the viewers a hole in the seat.  Right after we see the hole the person is killed with a pipe the shoots out of the hole.  It was stuff like this that disappointed me the end results.  Yes the movie is watchable for true fans of the series.",

This movie also suffers from bordem unless the creeper is on screen. Now, the rest of the promblem came in the form of \"dumb decisions.\" For instance the death scenes were dumb. The plot was dumb (especially the part that revolves around the floating hand). The movie breaks its own logic, and ends randomly. Also in this movie the creepers car is apparently the bat mobile. This makes no sense in the creeper storyline because, it's not mentioned any other time in the series. So overall this is a dumb movie. There are very few complements I can give to this movie. It had decent acting, and a decent way of connecting the first movie with the second. Also, the creeper looked great. Better then he has in any of the other movies.

Like stuntman Kane Hodder's forays as Jason Voorhees, Breck transfuses the Creeper with Thyestean mystique. While prowling around his prey in a hay-hauling truck, his eyes dilate and his nostrils snarl and later, he is sneeringly disgruntled about a gunshot on his Hesperian hat. He also whistles after an Olympic stance for his javelin throw. While it is an invidious interquel between the 2001 and 2003 pictures, the tie-in finale in which the basketball team is incunabular, is actually a reticular callback to the excruciating second chapter. Because it is not bankrolled from a major studio, a few CGI elements are poorly embellished such as the ball contraptions from the Creeper's crenellated van and the bullet ricochets off of its impregnable exterior. Victor Salva tints the flick with oppressively nerve-racking atmosphere (Gaylen Brandon (Meg Foster) soliloquizes with her deceased son on a breathtakingly pink-filtered sunrise horizon) and stereo-quaking frights with the Creeper in silhouette atop his vehicle or extemporaneously perching in front of dirt bikers (the most sadistic, rabbit-slaying member, Kirk Mathers' (Ryan Moore) comeuppance via a booby-trapped seat is thankfully not procrastinated). While it isn't strictly a cockamamie spoof of the slasher subgenre, Salva reflexively lampoons it with the campy in-jokes such as the car's-ignition-won't-start chestnut and then it is collated with a gag about a noisy cell phone. The origins of the winged gargoyle are only a minuscule tease around a disembodied hand on a farm property and its trance that informs the holder of the Creeper's weakness.",

One of the first positives that come to mind are the production values and the cinematography. Some of the camera angles are pretty awesome. Very hard to review this without giving things away. Another positive is some(attempt at) character development similar to Part 1. More screen time for creeper than probably both movies put together, which is awesome. Not every thing is rosy though...acting, especially that of the lead actress was wooden at best. Some claims which Salva made about the movie were not true, which was a huge disappointment for me. To summarize, don't miss it at any cost if you are a JC fan. Oh and there is a surprise cameo as well :)",

The Creeper truck appears in the first half of 1, then later we kinda forget about the truck because he's swooping down out of the sky - and throughout JC2.... etc. My point is, even though the movies don't seem to be meticulously planned out in these aspects, they are still a BLAST for Halloween season! \nJeepers Creepers 3 did a fine job of bringing in new characters and creating enough dynamic to keep it interesting (much better than staying mostly at one location like in JC2 on the school bus). \nIt served its purpose for me! \nOh yeah..

If you enjoy Monster movies with the focus being on the monster and or are already a fan of this particular character. Jeepers Creepers 3 should scratch that itch, however the film is not without flaws. continuity errors. plot contrivance and so on.  At the end of the day, it was a film made for the fans. Unfortunately most \"supposed\" fans have claimed this film to be a betrayal to the original two. It puzzles me how misinformed or out of touch some viewers are with content and how these films work.  Still if your not a fan of monster movies, thrillers, or horror. there is nothing here that will change your mind. but if you enjoy classic monsters such as Freddy, Myers, Jason.

His original trench coat type, western Jacket and that old black rim hat are surely missed! The technology of crappy computer graphics really jacked up the whole idea of an Ancient Cannabalistic Supernatural Evil.

From my understanding, the script was altered/rewritten several times as cast members continued to decide that they no longer wished to be a part of the film for moral and/or political reasons. So, it appears that scenes from the different scripts that were filmed were combined which didn't glow well together and appeared to have different plots As a huge fan of the first two movies, I truly believe that if they had put more time into writing a final script instead of using pieces of the others, that this could have been a great film. I have hope for any more possible sequels or prequels and that hopefully they wont have the production interruptions that this film had.",

Awesome performance by Breck, little content or new plot, but still satisfying to watch as it connects movie 1 and 2 and sets up for an actual sequel, the fourth installment which will take place 23 years later. Honestly I think people are judging the movie too harshly.. the first two weren't exactly model material. I think this sequel/prequel definitely improved in comparison and deserves to be seen.",

But there were some good performances and a some really cool sequences. The audience I saw it with at the Regal Harrisburg Stadium 14 in Harrisburg, Pa. on that one-night-only screening on Sept. 26, 2017 had a blast. Their favorite part seemed to be that scene when the four teens riding dirt bikes stumbled on The Creeper's van. That sequence was a lot of fun! Some folks in the crowd clapped and some commented on the carnage. The actor who's been playing The Creeper all this time, Jonathan Breck, does a fine job. It's nice to see him back in action. I thought \"Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017)\" was a okeydoke low-budget horror sequel.

Personally, after watching the extended trailer, I was not sure if the movie was going to be good or not, but after watching it tonight I can say with conviction that the 14 years of waiting were worth it. Now, if one bases his/her opinion about the quality of the movie on its special effects, then, yes the movie sucks. But this is an independent film which had to go through a lot to get made. The movie keeps you on the edge while also giving enough background to understand it and give it meaning but also not so much to make it boring. I was surprised it even made laugh the people that were at the screening. It is suspenseful, terrifying, and passionate. Meg Foster's performance was pretty good, I must say. The script was better than I expected. This movie perfectly connected its story to those of the other two movies with such ease that it did not seem forced. So yes, if one bases on people's backgrounds at the time of judging art, like films, then no one would watch a movie because I do not think everyone checks the background of every single person that appears on the credits who was involved in the making of any film.

Only thing I really like about the film was that even though I don't like how the Creeper looks, I still like how he kills his victims. 2 and a 1/2 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Ok, I'm going to be honest here. I'm a big fan of the franchise. I have both movies, and have rewatched them over the years. This is my favorite franchise. I've waited 14 years for this. 2 is my favorite, I saw it before 1. It was scary and wowed me.\n\nThis brings me to tonight. I'm not a professional movie critic, I'm just a regular movie goer. I saw the 1 night showing. I was pumped. I left disappointed but optimistic. The Creeper is back! We know what he's all about. \n\nWhat was odd is this movie picked up after Jeeper's Creepers 1. What?! It should've picked up after part 2. Rememebr Ray Wise looking 23 years older sitting in the Barn?? Made no sense... Also how do you explain the hawk like talons in part 2 vs him wearing boots in parts 1 & 3??\n\nThey set out to hunt him down and expose his origins. Well they literally gave 2 crumbs about his origin (which I know they're saving for the next installment but still), so that's a negative. I thought the makeup (& crows) were not as good as prior installments. He didn't look as scary as he did in parts 1 and 2. The Creeper seemed to be bulked up, was he wearing shoulder pads?! Also he moved at supersonic speeds. Slow him down in the next movie. It took the fun out of things, it really did. I get it, but all the old 50's pickup trucks are just getting old and annoying to see, this is the 3rd installment. You just don't end a movie like that. I literally sat there like, oh no, they are not going to end it here, they can't! Oh & they did end it there after 5 minutes or so. This movie lacked killing & removing or eating body parts. Where was all the terror man?? That's what the Creeper is known for, and that's what we want to see. They normally try to set things up first, and that's what it seemed they were doing. This was very disappointing. I hate to say it but this almost seemed to be a B level movie. Like Wrong Turn 3, 4, etc.\n\nBack to the ending. Bad move, but I know what Victor is doing. He's setting up the next installment which I think will get back to the Creeper ways we are all familiar with. Sorry but this movie appeared to be low budget. With all that has gone on I understand that. He has to be better with the next installment. He needs some high level backers with deep pockets.  This next installment cannot come out straight to DVD 10 years from now. That just won't work.\n\nThey did good things like letting us see how he operates, his truck, some backstory about the prom couple from the first movie. It appears he's (Victor)doing an Alien type of jumping around with the storyline.",
