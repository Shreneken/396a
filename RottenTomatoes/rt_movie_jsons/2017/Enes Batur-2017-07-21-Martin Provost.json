            "content": "A must-see for Catherine Deneuve fans. In her mid-70s she looks fabulous and plays an outrageous character that doesn't seem far from how I imagine her real self. Small story about an unusual relationship. The other lead is a midwife, but that's just background. A plus however as we see lots of births and newborns. Film is very engaging. I was surprised to find we had been watching for two hours.",

            "content": "The distinct minority of The Midwife reviews that are negative generally find the movie treacly and thin and the ending contrived (conclusions I disagree with strongly). But they also uniformly find that the only reason to see it is the strong performances from the leads. Granted, for the sake of argument, that their criticisms have validity, why wouldn't the opportunity to see a tour de force duel between two of our best actresses, Catherine Frot and Catherine Deneuve, rate a fresh tomato on its own? That factor would place this movie above 90% of this year's meager offerings for me!",

            "content": "What is there to say about this already marvellous film, made sublime by Catherine Deneuve's performance.  It is an essay about people caring for one another, and how difficult but vital that is.  It is an extraordinary pictorial of children being born, and of their young mothers' stories, joyous or desperate.  You see babies being delivered by long experienced midwives in small local centres, soon to be replaced by hi-tech, male-dominated birthing factories.  The star in the title role is Catherine Frot, who speaks the key line - someone has to say no to the money maniacs.  This film combines French technical perfectionism with profound human values. Everything from the screenplay, cinematography, direction, production and supporting cast is brilliant, yet it is the emotional power of the film that is remarkable: the two aspects fusing perfectly is a rare achievement. Frot lends a precisely drawn, sustained structure to the entire film, transforming her character with it, as it ranges into big emotional challenges and life changes. Deneuve is always capable of expressing her character's entire potential; the past, present and future are woven into every moment. As Beatrice, she has a spectacular role in a great film, and she takes it effortlessly to the limits; she is the master of tinging tragedy with humour and vice versa, she fills the screen with passion and optimism, she drives the scenes; it all happens in an instant. You get caught up before you have realised it.  There is simply nothing to compare.",
