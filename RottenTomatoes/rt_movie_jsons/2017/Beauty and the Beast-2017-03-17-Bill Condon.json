I surprised myself by remembering some of the song lyrics - I saw the original, mostly 2D animated version of this film Disney released in the early 1990s. I suppose I am, in that way, a bit biased, given I was a massive Disney fan and loved the 1990s version but I did enjoy this adaptation - I can't say its not a bit cheesy but then I suppose I kind of like that, in a sense. Its clearly very family friendly, although its been given a PG rating in the UK, due to the lifelike appearance of said Beast and the dark settings (both visually and thematically speaking) that feature - it wouldn't be doing the story justice if that wasn't the case though.\n\nI felt Emma Watson gave a very convincing performance and I thought it did well as a piece of escapist cinema. I enjoyed the characters, the plot and the main performance, so I'm not sure what else I can say really. Oh and I enjoyed singing along to what I remembered of the songs too. This is a film worth watching at home to sing along to - its part family drama perhaps but moreso part musical, athough it certainly isn't a musical entirely from start to end but then neither is it a full blown drama I suppose - of course it had to be sanitised for the family friendly rating but I honestly can't say I was disappointed by it due to that at all, so I'm giving this the full 5 star rating. For what it is, its very good.",

There are some big names in this film: Emma Watson as Belle, Dan Stevens as Beast, Luke Evans as Gaston, Josh Gad as LeFou, Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, etc. They all do a great job with what they are given, except for the music. With the exception of \"Gaston\", all the songs in this film feel unemotional and over processed. Some of this, I feel, is due to the fact that there is limited musical theater experience with the actors chosen for this film. Ewan McGreagor is good, but he can't hold a candle (pun intended) to Jerry Orbach's many years of musical acting experience. The CGI for the Beast's face was lacking and I'm sure it hid a great facial performance from Stevens. There were a couple of scenes where Watson felt like a stick saying, or singing, lines. The added material didn't feel necessary to the story, though some of the plot holes from the original film were plugged.

Beast is a stand-in for Mercury, and/or Dionysus, and that's why the beautiful Athena-like witch shows up in ugly drag to test his hospitality. When he turns the witch away based on exterior appearances, not recognizing the beauty of her wisdom, she curses his kingdom to be physical objects until Beauty reappears. Then it's up to Beauty to reverse the curse through her wisdom, by seeing past the objectification of the Beast as a horrible animal to locked up in a mansion with his material things. \n\nIt's important here that Belle is the hero. The Beast can't fix himself, he's the victim, and only someone who reads books and doesn't just stare at the covers can put it all together before the rose loses her last petal...",

            "content": "Of the Disney live-action remakes, this is one of the better ones.  Of the category of \"remakes that follow the original to a fault\" I'd say it's probably the best of the batch.  The original Beauty and the Beast is a concise 90 minutes that goes by super easy and gives you everything you need.  Yes there's a lot of little details and character elements left out, but as a fairy tale, it works.  And it was one of the first Disney movies to show a truly strong female lead and a depth to its romance (no, I don't buy into that Stockholm theory).  Belle was headstrong, the Beast was stubborn, and they worked through it into a unique love.  Did we need to know about all the townspeople?  No, it wasn't a story about them.  Did we need the enchantress to return at the end along with the full plothole filling details about her curse?  No, because it was a fairy tale.  Did we need a tragic backstory for both Belle and Beast that shows how they became the people they are?  Not really, we get enough of them in the present to draw our own conclusions.  The live action version however, gives us those things.  \nThe thing is though, each time it would go into a bit adding something, I would be reluctant at first but by the end I'd think \"y'know what, that's actually fine, that works.\"  Is it all necessary?  Not at all, but if you're going to expand on this story into something of an epic musical, the stuff they expand on it with is good stuff.  I'll be honest, getting more one-on-one moments between Belle and Beast was really effective, and the moments were often touching.  The original showed the development fine, but this shows a little more, and I like what it shows.  There's also new songs, and unlike something like say live-action Aladdin, the songs fit the tone of the rest of the film.  \nThe musical segments are good too.  There's smaller pieces where there need to be, but there's also the big showstoppers that while not the animation, are still stellar in their own right.  They know how to use the live action space in the unique way it presents.  The biggest thing I like about the movie though is that the environments just looks great.  The set design of the castle, the town, this is a place I want to visit.  It looks alive and real.  Much of it is CGI obviously, but there's a good amount of practical effects that look amazing.  \nI've raved about this thing enough though, what doesn't work?  Honestly, the secondary characters.  Ewan McGregor is having a ton of fun as Lumiere, but everyone else feels like they're just sort of there.  There's not a lot of personality even though there's more time given to them.  Part of that I really credit to the character design.  The enchanted inhabitants are designed to look much more like their real life counterparts, but this takes away the personality they had in the animation.  Ewan McGregor has a voice and personality that works through that sometimes, but most of them don't.  As for the townsfolk, man I love Kevin Kline but he's just not that interesting as Belle's dad.  Josh Gad as LeFou is…mostly okay.  He gets some solid laughs, but at the end of the day it's just a Josh Gad performance, and I don't love some of the changes they make to his character in terms of his Gaston loyalty.  Speaking of Gaston though, Luke Evans is pretty good.  Not much more to say, he does the job.\nOverall, it's not the original animation, but it's still a solid update.  I don't like all these Disney reboots, but if they keep doing them with this level of effort, there's something to it.  It puts effort in and creates it's own (forgive me) beast.",

Whilst the set pieces are visually very impressive, the 3 dimensional live action version felt strangely flat in comparison to the animated version and struggles somewhat to replicate its magic or charm. Emma Watson is a little inconsistent. She seems a little wooden in places, but more charming in others. Many of the rest of the cast seem miscast also; although they all perform well. It has its moments, and you've got to admire the scope of what they were aiming for, particularly in the musical numbers. An enjoyable watch. But I'm struggling to find much that it offers that isn't already offered by the fantastic original film; which begs the question of why a life action version was needed in the first place.",

According to the costumer, she wanted to update Belle's attire and make it more modern. Instead, she just made it ugly! Why, why, why?\nA standout cast with some amazing acting by Luke Evans as Gaston and Josh Gad as LeFou (Olaf came through at times), but Emma Watson as Belle is just not good casting. Emma has zero presence and is completely unbelievable in the role. I think she was cast for name recognition and star power, not for talent. (The auto-tuning is painful.)\nKids will love this movie because it's a classic, but discerning adults will be annoyed by it's poor choices.",

This is yet another movie in the popular trend of making movies with gorgeous visuals, but absolutely lacklustre and washed out characters, story and music.

This movie like every remake by Disney has its pro’s and con’s. Emma Watson does a great job as the lead Belle, minus the over auto tuned vocals. Dan Stevens are the Beast delivers a playable performance. Luke Evans as the villainous Gaston steals the movie with his charm and devilish personality. This movie uses so much CGI that the real in person characters don’t blend with their environments. The Beast was completely made from motion capture and CGI so his mannerisms don’t look as real as I would have hoped. The music is all there with some new musical numbers added. All the supporting characters like Lumiere, Mrs Potts and Coggsworth are all fun but I wish they had more screen time. They tried to add some more adult themed depth to the film but for some viewers it’s a hit and a miss. This is a beautiful movie with some great practical sets. A lot of the moments just feel phoned in at times and that takes away some of the magic the original cartoon built for us.",

The songs both new and old, were actually better than the originals. This is testimony to the effort and detail put into making this film as perfect and equal to the original as possible. \n   The film does lean into the original's source material very heavily, and because of this the live action version cannot take too much credit.

The story structure is all over the place, and the characters don't feel like actual characters.

It is always so interesting to see what kind of twist Disney will do in the live action. Beauty and the Beast is a classic disney movie. It starts out with a prince who was rude to an old woman seeking shelter and not letting her in. She turns out to be this beautiful woman and turns the prince into a beast and all the people who live there are inanimate objects. Then it goes to Belle who lives in the small town and is the only woman who reads. There is a guy named Gaston and his goal is to marry belle. He tries but she rejects him. Now Belle's father gets lost and ends up at the castle where the beast lives and the beast prisons him. Belle figures this out and heads to the castle and becomes the replacement. The beast figures out that Belle might be the one who can break the spell but he only has a limited amount of time. He tries to be nicer but her father becomes ill and she has to go back. She then tells where she was at and everyone thinks the beast is mean so the men go out to kill him. Gaston is the leader and he fails and ends up falling off the roof and dying. Belle says I love you to the beast as he was wounded and the spell is broken. \nI think that Emma Waston was perfect as Belle and that Luke Evans was the perfect Gaston. Belle looked exactly how she did in the classic and so did Gaston. In fact Luke Evans looked exactly like the real Gaston in the classic. He did a fantastic job on his acting and acted like a jerk like Gaston. Emma also did a great job acting as Belle in this film. She had such passion and acted so much like Belle.  The settings were not brightly colored but they were still magical. Like the detail in the castle was amazing. I like the twist that was added to the middle and explains why Belle and her father moved to this small town. This movie may not exactly be like the original but it is worth seeing. Especially the be our guest song. With all the utensils dancing and all the details you would want to be there too. I also liked how they got the people to dress up like French people. In the classic this is not done. I think that whoever thinks about seeing this movie should see it. You have nothing to lose.",

If i questioned whether belle had stockholm before, she definitely does now. I'd be offended if some guys told me my favorite books were junk, especially considering belle had like 10 books to read from the church. No where near the tiny book store/library she had before.\n-Belle became a Bitch, I know Gaston is our villain but the way she turned him down the first time they interact was incredibly rude. We're suppose to like her because she has a great personality. Don't get me wrong Gaston starts showing just how cruel he can get, but give the guy a chance he has PTSD...(sorry ptsd viewers).\n-When u get to the 3rd extra song, and realize why they were cut from the movie.\n-Why does the town hate Belle so much that they have to ruin her laundry day. Also where did the ingenuity come from, her Dads a clock maker now, not a clever inventor. Also since everyone likes Gaston so much, wouldn't that make the town folk less likely to want to harass her, since the whole town wants to get into his pants?\n- Emma doesnt stand out for her big beautiful dress reveal scene. It's Hermiones beauty reveal scene all over again. Do makeup artist and costume designers just not know how to dress Emma up so that she stands out??? She's gonna get lost if she gets thrown into a sea of young women in prom dresses in that dress.\n-I need to learn to turn my brain off when i watch movies like this, theres so much to nitpick.\n-TURN THE AUTO-TUNE OFF. SHE SOUNDS LIKE A ROBOT, I'M SURE SHE CAN SING.\n-LGBT queer baiting at its finest, La Fou(the fool) barely makes any moves on Gaston, suggesting hes actually interested. The one time he gets close is in Gastons song, and even then La Fous remark goes over the heads of everyone, especially Gaston. (he doesnt even get turned down and La Fou gives up on him, there's too much wrong with the way this character is written.)\n-The end credits look like a copy and paste of the twilight end credits... wait...\n-Cast was a decent choice.\n-Be our guest was difficult for me to watch, the actor was great, but the song itself is hard to listen to without the original voice.\n-Nevermore and the opening song are the best extra added in songs. The Oprah singer has a magnificent voice!!!",

            "content": "I thought this movie was alright when I first went to see it, but when watching it again I really realized that I wasn't much of a fan.  The acting is subpar and only a few people in the film can actually sing, so everyone else is autotuned so much they sound like robots.  The movie is much longer than the original, yet so many important things from the story are cut out, making room for random filler that waters down the story and in my opinion completely ruins it.  Everything is just dragged out and honestly boring.  Although the sets and some of the costumes are pretty, they don't save the film. Most of the movie is done using CGI, which makes everything just look fake and creepy.  All the emotion and movement that could be expressed in the animation of the original movie has been replaced by dead eyed computer generated creatures and actors that often don't seem too invested (although they've done much better in other films).  Also, almost every actor had a British accent, even though the film took place in France.  So much for making the film \"more realistic.\"  There are a few new songs in the movie that are actually pretty good, but they're poorly sung.  But the main thing that bothered me about this movie was the character of Lefou.  Leading up to the film, there were tons and tons of news articles about how Lefou was going to be \"Disney's first openly LGBTQ+ character!\" But besides a two-second scene at the end of the film that could be interpreted as the character finding a love interest, the statements weren't true at all.  It was mostly just Disney's way of acting like they were including an LGBTQ+ character without actually writing in the representation in fear of angering anyone who was against having LGBTQ+ characters in movies.  But in doing so, they also upset the side of their audience that desperately wanted to see that representation.  There wasn't really much point in rebooting the old animated film to begin with, but if Disney was going to make another, they should've at least made it good.  This film was just a way for the company to cash in on nostalgia and make even more money without anyone having to think.  If you want a GOOD live-action Beauty and The Beast musical, just go see the stage show.",

The original, La Belle et la Bête, was published in 1740 by Madame de Villeneuve, then abridged and rewritten by Madame Leprince de Beaumont in 1757. Find an analysis of the differences between the modern film and the original La Belle et la Bête by Madame de Villeneuve here.\n\nThere have been many adaptations of the story since the original was written, in the form of literature, film, music and performance. Authors are seemingly drawn to revisiting literatures and reworking them in an effort to create a conversation between themselves and literatures of the past. This illustrates how literature adapts to a new age and its new media, making universal age-old ideas modern and relevant. We are all standing on the shoulders of giants. Giants being those major texts, canonical texts, texts that have withstood time, ancient texts that are still studied today, texts that offer ancient wisdoms, texts that are referenced and made new by modern authors.\n\nThe 1972 version \"retold\" by Philippa Pearce and illustated by Alan Barrett borrows from the Madame de Villeneuve's original telling entirely, and will be used here as the basis of comparison between the original tale and Disney's film(s).\n\nThe classic 1991 Disney cartoon did indeed base itself on ideas from both Madame Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont's 1757 La Belle et la Bête, as well as the 1946 French Film directed by Jean Cocteau. However, Disney's version differs greatly from the original tale. Elements surrounding the curse, the enchantments, the castle, and even the life of Belle diverge heavily from Madame de Villeneuve's tale. The 2017 remake closely followed the same plot line as the 1991 version; making them both somewhat inaccurate in regards to referencing the true original.\n\nhttps://thewandererliteraryjournal.wordpress.com/2017/04/08/la-belle-et-la-bete-or-beauty-and-the-beast/",

The new song beast sings is boring and while he has a good voice this number adds nothing to the story, only pads run time. The subplot about Belle's mother was \"nice\", but has no purpose in the story and ends up just padding the run time. \"Be Our Guest\" was...neat...but a little off putting at times with the visuals. I genuinely think Angela Lansberry could have been recast as Mrs. Potts again, make chip the grandson, and the role would have been great. However, my biggest gripe is the animation for her and chip is just creepy, they lacked expression because their bodies were completely still whereas Lumiere's was flexible and could even stretch a little. This could be better.",

All of that would have put it at a 3/5 for me, but there's a ton of politically motivated material in this movie. It's basically Liberal Virtue Signaling: The Movie, and it hits on enough topics that it's distracting. Every person in the movie we're supposed to like is either gay or a feminist or a cross-dresser or black or in a multiracial couple, etc. Every person who is bad is white, uses guns, doesn't read books, etc. On the whole, the movie is just about as bad as the unwatchably terrible Jungle Book (2016) live action remake, and it's just a big waste of time.",

We know the characters, we know the story and we know the ending. However, this movie brings with it some new fundamentals with it that make it unique  and a good re-telling of the animation. Visually, this movie is nearly flawless. The attention to detail that Disney is known for is on full display in this movie. The landscapes are breath-taking, the village feels like a small French village hundreds of years in the past and the castle with its inhabitants are immaculate. Emma Watson plays a passable Belle, but she was missing something in terms of the presence the original had. The beast looked awful and could have definitely been worked on better. The costume and makeup did the actor no favors and seemed to hinder his facial expressions and also his mobility. The characters we know and love running around looking like actual artifacts with some human features was amazing and added that sense of realism to them. The biggest take away for me was the songs and how they were handled. We had the classic songs from the animation, but we also had a few new songs that helped move the story along nicely. The song that the Beast sings after setting Belle free is chilling and emotional, thoroughly elevating the character. Adding social commentary to this film did not hurt the overall presentation but it did kinda detract from the messages within. Having the villagers be deathly afraid of a woman that not only CAN read, but LOVES reading seemed off putting and petty. Any lover of the animation will enjoy this film for the most part. Is it as perfect as the animation, no, but it has its place in film history. A definite must watch and probably the best live action enactment of the classic animations thus far.",

Rarely has a movie felt so lifeless to me, so money-grabbing. In each scene I can just see a room of Disney executives making these decisions to maximise profit without having to give us anything new or challenging.\nThe singing - particularly coming from Emma Watson - is embarrassingly bad. Every song sounds dull and completely devoid of any emotion. They don't even flow very well in the plot, and feel as if they only exist because these songs were in the original, and they have to include them.\nBelle and the Beast's dynamic is greatly changed for the worse in this movie. While most of the time they stick to exactly what happened in the original, occasionally they make changes to it that utterly baffle me, and reduce the relationship between the two leads. As an example, in the original roughly halfway through the movie Belle is feeling down and depressed, and the Beast spontaneously decides to give her his library, for he known how much she loves books. You can see the excitement in his eyes as he does this, and it's an excellent way for the audience to feel empathy for his character and to build and improve his relationship with Belle. On the other hand, in this movie the two characters are arguing, and Belle questions Beast's literary prowess. In an offhand manner, he takes her into the library and grudgingly shows her around. What does this do to make them fall for each other?\nThe effects are on the whole, very good. The production design - particularly the castle - is striking and effective. Unfortunately, there is one area which sticks out like a sore thumb: the Beast. I never once feel as if the Beast is actually there, never once see anything but Belle in the famous dance sequence. Not only that, his character design is atrocious, looking awful and mismatched.\nIt's sad for me that a film company which not so very long ago carved out an identity making films that took risks, challenged the audience and made us feel for 2D characters is now happy and willing to continue making these bland, unchallenging and lifeless remakes. But out of all of these souless products, this is by far the worst.",

The only thing she's got going is her brown hair and that's pretty much it .  I did like Gaston his character was good and really funny though.  But I just still can't understand why they would choose Emma Watson. Literally the entire village of people is  better looking than her  as for the CGI I didn't really like it. It looked very cheap and fake to me. The beast seemed very out of character and he just didn't act like the original beast.  I will say the castle looked amazing and very beautiful they did a very good job on the costumes. But Emma Watson ruined it for me.  If they would have chosen a different actors to play as bell I probably would have liked the movie a lot better. I had high hopes for the movie but I was extremely disappointed.

Disney's 1991 animated film is an all-time favorite of mine, and I'm a big fan of the stage musical too. The live action remake goes all out on making a lavishing musical film that manages to embellish and to an extant improve upon the original animated film. It features all the classics songs, including some lovely new songs that are just beautifully crafted and well placed within the existing score. The cast brings their A-game with stellar performances, especially from Luke Evans and Josh Gad. Disney has unleashed one of their best live action remakes of their animated properties. It's an unabashed rehash of its animated predecessors that does it justice, while it has a considerable amount of additional materials to make it stand as its own entity. \n\nThe story follows the Disney version beat-by-beat; even some of the shots are almost identical at times to the original animated film. It's also has really neat little nods and story elements of the stage musical were added into the remake; for instance, the melody of \"Home\" a song from the stage musical is used in the film's underscore. However, some aspects of the story have been altered slightly or added on for the remake. These additions include some backstories for Belle and the Beast, and a new character inhabiting the castle named Maestro Cadenza. The film stars an intrepid A-list cast to breathe new life to the characters from the beloved animated film. \n\nThe cast are exceptional and well cast in their roles, including Emma Watson. She delivers a wonderfully heartfelt performance as Belle. She's not the best singer in the cast, but she still manages to do a capable job with the songs. Dan Stevens (who plays the Beast) and the supporting cast also do a commendable job bring depth, while capturing the characters personalities. The standout performances of the film go to Luke Evans as the antagonist Gaston and Josh Gad as Gaston's sidekick Lefou. Together they both steal the scene with their comedic charisma, and chemistry. The film's visual style is a real treat for the eyes with its lavishing set, animation, and effects. \n\nThe set design and computer graphics are so exquisitely beautiful; it can be a bit overwhelming to take in. One sequence in particular the \"Be Our Guest\" musical number is extraordinarily spectacular with its visual effects and animation. The effects are truly magical, and its blend of computer animation, production value, and motion capture techniques are sublime. The designs of the enchanted objects have a more realistic look, than their animated counterparts. However, their charming personalities manage to keep them endearing parts of the film. The motion capture is impressively used to transform Dan Stevens into the Beast. The result is a cross between a lion and a ram like creature, but still maintains the actor's facial features. The highlight is of course the songs and music by Disney legend Alan Menken, who returned to score the live-action adaption. \n\nThe classic songs are still as catchy as ever, but the remake also includes new songs by Alan Menken and Tim Rice. They are just as lovely as the classics songs from the animated film. The best new song is the addition of a new song for the Beast called \"Evermore\". Stevens does an amazing job singing this heart-rending song. I also really enjoyed \"How Does a moment last forever\", and \"Days in the Sun\" are all great companions to the existing songs. I also appreciate the updated orchestral arrangements, which never have I heard my favorite Disney score sound more lush than ever. It has everything you love about the Disney version, and then some. \n\nOverall, Disney brings a dazzling spectacle that will enchant most fans of the Disney animated film, and even some newcomers. It embellishes the story enough without being a carbon copy for new generations to enjoy. The cast brings tremendous amount of devotion to the characters, yet gives them enough depth to make them more intriguing. It exquisitely blends high production value with state of the art technology to bring the beloved story to life. This is a well-made remake that feels old, yet still feels fresh for modern audiences.",

Nothing really new and exciting, except that which confuses the audience more. They fixed some plots holes, but in so doing created twice as many. The only \"real\" singer of the group (Audra MacDonald) sang for about a total of two minutes, whereas Emma Watson, with a flatter and less lively voice than Kristen Stewart, sang in a majority of the songs. Definitely a disappointment. Great to see Alan Menken back on the crew, but re-done songs were sort of only done as a formality, not to really impress. The new songs were pure filler and were completely unnecessary. What I took home from this film: nobody tried. They made a live-action for the sake of live-action. It's the trend; the first couple of live-action Disney remakes were okay, but just reinventing every classic film isn't exactly justified, as seen here. Nobody tried because it's simply a frame-by-frame remake, so everything was done simply as a formality. Camera work and set design is interesting and at some points stunning, but nothing can replace the incredible design and colour the animation displays and always will.",

However, Disney unfortunately takes a PC brush to the fairytale with conspicuous placements of minorities (in 19th century France), turning LeFou into a gay character, and making Belle more proactive and independent.  Still, the all-star cast featuring Emma Watson, Luke Evans, Ian McKellen, Ewan McGregor, Kevin Kline, and Emma Thompson delivers wonderful performances.  And the CGI work and choreography are extraordinary, making for some extravagant and lavish musical numbers.

            "content": "- Beauty and the Beast, can you remake a tale as old as time? -\n\nMaybe I'm a tad biased, but I think criticism is a beautiful thing. If a book, song, movie, or any other piece of art is worthwhile - truly great in some way - it will survive even harsh critique. Just because something has flaws or troubling aspects, doesn't make it totally worthless.\n\nThe critique of the year is, will 2017's live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, directed by Bill Condon (The Twilight Saga) be as memorable as the original for future generations?\n\nYeah, there have always been critics of the original story. Does it glorify abusive relationships for instance? Stockholm Syndrome anyone? But Linda Woolverton, who wrote the 1991 screenplay, had something else entirely in mind during production.\n\n\"I deliberately set out to create a Disney heroine who was about more than her looks or how nicely she could behave when terrible things were happening to her,\" she tells The Guardian. \"I came out of the 60s and I was a feminist; I didn't think women would accept a heroine who was going to sit around and wait for the prince to come and save her. The opening scene with her reading the books as she walks through town was what I did as a kid: when my mother sent me to the store, I kept reading all the way there and back.\"\n\nI, too, was that girl with her nose in a book. There are so many of us! And Beauty and the Beast finally gave us Belle, the Elizabeth Bennet of Disney animation. She's not afraid to be a nerd, she fights back, she says \"heck no\" to the jerk trying to edge in on her space - yet she still has enough kindness and compassion in her heart to learn to love somebody everyone else sees as a \"monster.\"\n\nA remake of a movie like this has a hundred new ways to shine. I love it when remakes tread new ground and make their own special moments. But they also have a hundred ways to fail - especially if the intangible magic of the original is muddled somewhere along the way.\n\nThe 2017 Beauty and the Beast, starring Emma Watson (Harry Potter) and Dan Stevens (Downton Abbey), is first and foremost an experience in nostalgia. But it also brings several great qualities to the cinematic table of its own merit.\n\nThe cast is, by and large, utterly charming. Watson brings spunk and a lovely youthfulness to Belle, and Stevens gives the Beast great depth and personality - both in different ways from their predecessors. Luke Evans (The Girl on the Train) shines magnificently as Gaston - emerging as the most well-rounded performer of the ensemble - and Audra McDonald (Shuffle Along, Broadway) continues to reign supreme over every note she touches, making us almost wish that she was cast to play every character instead of just the jolly wardrobe.\n\nThe film incorporates some new and satisfying moments, bringing in subtle elements of the original french fable, such as the request-and-theft of the rose (I love a good continuing motif!). It nods to the Broadway stage production, giving more backstory and depth to the enchanted household objects such as Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson, Bridget Jones's Baby), Cogsworth (Ian McKellen, The Lord of the Rings), Lumiere (Ewan McGregor, Jane Got a Gun), and others.\n\nIt also takes care of a few curious plot holes from the original, like Why have no villagers seemed to notice the HUGE CASTLE until these events? Haven't they wondered whatever happened to their Prince? and Wait, if the flower stops blooming when the Prince turns 21, and the servants have been rusting \"for ten years,\" wouldn't that have made the Price an actual child when he was originally cursed?\n\n(You know you've wondered this!)\n\nGetting to see this new material was really fun, especially in a remake where you're anticipating a lot of familiarity.\n\nUnfortunately though, even with the fresh moments, I think the remake lacks the spark needed to make it a treasure that families will return to again and again.\n\nFirst, it lacks some necessary patience and cohesion. From the absolute beginning of the prologue to the ending moments, the movie was filled to the brim and moved along with noticeable clumsiness. The directing and editing felt rushed, and very rarely was the audience given time to sit with a moment, a note, or a shot, before another swirled along.\n\n(Contrast this with the patient \"Lavender's Blue\" reveal scene in the Cinderella remake, and you'll know just what I mean!)\n\nFrom a cinematic perspective, I'm also of the opinion that the movie should have been much more visually arresting than it was. Some visuals were strong, don't get me wrong - like the Beast's castle being under a perpetual winter because of the curse - but too many settings and locations were forgettable or indistinguishable. For example, we should get to know the castle like a character of its own, but unfortunately, that didn't really happen.  \n\nOther spectacle-driven scenes like \"Be Our Guest\" - while sung beautifully by Ewan McGregor - echoed the 1991 version in color scheme and style but felt a bit off when taken out of the original medium (maybe it's the vaguely unsettling character design of the new CG animated objects?). Sometimes it just takes a simple touch to make a scene pop the right way, and this new version could have used more of those touches to draw focus.\n\nAnd, I would be remiss not to say that I was extremely disappointed in the sound and vocal editing choices made by the filmmakers here. You may have read or heard complaints about the film's use of \"autotune\" in Emma Watson's singing. The digital smoothing of the singing in this film is one of the strongest and most noticeable I've heard in a movie musical, and I was not a fan.\n\nWhen you take a step back and consider the whole though, the movie is still fun. Some people even left the theatre weeping with joy! Watching it brought major nostalgia for this 90's kid, and I think it will for others as well. A movie so packed with familiar score and talented actors is honestly worth anyone's time, especially if you enjoy the world of fairy tales. (Head's up: it will also make you super keen to watch the original again, so dust off that VHS.)\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse,http://narrativemuse.co/movies/beauty-and-the-beast, and was written by Debbie Holloway.

            "content": "A Beauty of a remake with its sumptuous visuals and endearing players, this live-action take on an animated classic manages to be a different Beast for better and worse--edgier, zippier, and often fresher. In this PG-rated adaptation of the Disney-fied fairy tale, a monstrous-looking prince (Dan Stevens) and a young woman (Emma Watson) fall in love, much to the chagrin of her self-absorbed suitor (Luke Evans).\n\n1991's Beauty and the Beast very possibly ranks highest among animated musicals, not to mention it's arguable standing as Disney's greatest 'toon. Just as with Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella, and The Jungle Book (Snow White & the Huntsman is more of an out-and-out re-do), moviegoers are right to be more a little scared - than prepared - for the Mouse House re-imagining what amounts to an already polished and pristine jewel in their crown. And yet, like those other remakes, it all works beautifully...for the most part. Though Disney's Belle never felt like a damsel in distress, V.2 sees fit to engage in gender politics which also spills over into the characterization of supporting player LeFou, who now has more than a platonic shine for lunkheaded heel Gaston. While there's no question that such empowerment could only enhance the characters and story overall, this inclusion feels more like it was shoehorned in because of topicality than integrated organically. Such an 'upgrade' should feel like a natural fit--not like it was forced.\n\nThere's a lot that screenwriters Evan Spiliotopoulos and Stephen Chbosky get right with their update, however. The backstories of the players get fleshed out (we finally learn about Belle's Mom and see more of her father, for example), as does this enchanting world in general (the inanimate objects come to life in the Beast's castle serve as more than comic relief than the first go-round). Director Bill Condon (Dreamgirls, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn) deserves much of the credit, however, managing to stage the wonderful musical numbers such that the audience feels like they're seeing them for the first time (as there are new songs in the mix, some of them actually ARE first-timers). His canvas, encompassing town and forest and castledom, exhibits a magical quality not altogether different from the original, but oftentimes moodier and more sarcastic in keeping with modern insensitivity, er, sensibilities. Without a letter-perfect cast, however, the characters wouldn't jump off the screen. Watson, Stevens, Evans, Kevin Kline, and Josh Gad bring a lively and colorful energy to the goings-on. Though they don't hit every note perfectly, they sell through the wonderment all the same.\n\nTo Sum It All Up: Be Their Guest",

            "content": "Strengths: A remake is a tough game. A remake is even tougher when it's of a timeless classic like the original Beauty and the Beast. This does quite well with that tall task. Emma Watson (Belle) is tremendous as the lead. It's the best non-Hermione work of her career. She's perfect. Dan Stevens (Beast) has strong chemistry with her and also delivers a strong performance. The supporting roles are all well cast, like Luke Evans (Gaston), Ewan McGregor (Lumiere), Stanley Tucci (Maestro Cadenza), Ian McKellen (Cogsworth), and Emma Thompson (Mrs. Potts). A special shoutout to Josh Gad (LeFou), who was hilarious as Gaston's right hand man. He's funny in every scene. The movie does a good job respecting the original film, while making sure it feels just fresh enough.\n\nWeaknesses: It's almost impossible to avoid comparing this to the original. While it's very good, the original is an incredible film that this doesn't come close to matching. Despite being made by Disney in 2017, the visuals aren't as great as you'd expect. The Beast looks kind of distracting at times because he doesn't look realistic. I feel like the film also tried too hard to make Gaston evil. The character was mainly just a cocky douche, but he's over the top in this one.\n\nOverall: Though it doesn't match the levels of the original, this film does work as a very good remake. The casting is spot on, the music is catchy, and it pays enough respect to the original without feeling like a copy.",

It's an impressive production, filled with magic that can be seen on the sets, the costumes and the design, which all have an 18th century European feeling to them. But it's not all that this film has going for it. The entire cast shines, particularly Emma Watson as the fearless and dreamy Belle and Dan Stevens, which delivers a brilliant motion-capture performance as the Beast and he offers his handsome looks as the Prince. The film is a musical, just like the animation that inspired it, composed once again by the insanely talented Alan Menken. The skilled cast bring the melodies to life with their powerful singing - even though the slight use of autotune may be obvious in some parts. But seeing iconic animated scenes like \"Be Our Guest\" being brought to life gave me utter joy. The film looks stunning for most part, thanks to some brilliant VFX work, but the CGI on some certain characters may look old fashioned in a few years from now. It does feel like its slow pace at the beginning is only to allow a longer running time. But despite the flaws, it manages to add up to the story of the already beloved tale as old as time, with some new sweet details, as director Bill Condon and the rest of the crew make sure that they create the best wedding cake of a movie possible.",

The character was so forced to be some modern day feminist icon mistakes such as tucking a skirt into the 18th century version of underwear. I suppose that was artistic liberty. The historical inaccuracies are allover the place. English events and designs are pushed off as French. The ballroom scene was perhaps the most horrific. They had every opportunity to create such a beautiful Rocco stylized dress. Instead ugly prom dress was presented as the best they could come up with.

Though it was visually stunning a lot of elements felt wrong about this film. \n\nTo get my biggest criticism out of the way first, the casting of Emma Watson as Belle was a horrible choice. In a cast of actors who clearly can sing and can sing well, Watson is out of place when her overly autotuned and sterile voice joins in. Her acting wasn't much better with a bored look through most of the film. It might be unfair to compare her to an animated character but even Paige O'Hara had WAY more personality in her voice alone. Belle should be excited to talk about books with people or when they show even the slightest interest in her interests. Instead we get meh. \n\nThe rest of the cast was fine, some more serviceable than others but for the most part leagues above our protagonist. The music is for the most part rather good adaptations of the original songs although ruined when ever we hear Emma Watson sing. \n\nA big issue is that this film didn't really feel necessary. If it were drastically doing something different maybe but for the most part it's almost scene for scene exactly the same as the original excluding one or two moments. I just don't think being live action is enough to justify a remake like this. \n\nOverall, an okay film that still doesn't come close to comparing to the original.",

With Disney trying to remake everything that I held dear, I've decided long ago to look at these new live-action remakes as great opportunities for the next generation to connect with and spike interest about watching the original. And though I have mixed feelings about Maleficent, didn't go crazy about The Jungle Book, I think this one is up there with Cinderella. As all live action remakes, it relies on stardom to be attractive but with a truly remarkable group of actors put together, who can complain? Watson is stunning and graceful, Thompson was born to play Potts and Luke Evans is greater than the original. Stevens plays and nuanced Beast but I feel his appearance is not menacing enough (but, of course, more marketable). The costume and production design is resplendent and the CGI is capable, though sometimes it all gets too soundstagy for my taste. The longer runtime allows for some welcomed and purposeful scenes and great new songs but lets in some black sheep that really aren't needed. Despite some issues that I have with the overall direction and editing, it does manage to bring some new ideas that can be brought to life either through that circular shot when preparing dinner or in well-accomplished musical numbers like Be Our Guest and Gaston. Overall. it's a fast-paced, and well-thought out movie, striking a difficult balance between dialogue and song and reminding us that, with about 4 musicals theses last 4 months, it is great time for the musical genre! There are too many live-action remakes on the horizon, but judging from a Tim Burton's Dumbo, a Lion King with Beyoncé, a Cruela with Emma Stone and a Mary Poppins with Meryl Streep... As long as they're as good as this, I say keep them coming! It must bug me, of course, that all the fuss around the \"gay LeFou\" happened. It's disgusting that some regions refused to distribute the movie because he dances for literally two seconds with a man. What a retrogadous world that doesn't allow Disney to have queer chatacters in their movies, as they're pressured by foreign markets that won't allow it. In this particular situation, I see no heroes as Disney advertised that LeFou was gay but made almost no effort to develop a character that despite being camp was gay and rather being gay because the original character was camp.",

Most were from the original film, but those and the few new songs were all done well. Having seen the 1991 film, the story of the new one is almost identical to the original. The only difference being that there are a few new scenes added. Then again, the original story was near-perfect, so not changing it is just fine. As far as acting goes, all the performers do a fine job, especially Luke Evens as Gaston. The only one who didn't do well was the lead actress, Emma Watson. She does an ok job in the role as Belle, but she seemed to lack energy and her vocal performance was only so-so. On a side note, the soundtrack by Alan Menken is amazingly good. This isn't a surprise, as he also scored the original film. Overall, I would give Beauty and the Beast (2017) a 70%. While it's nowhere near as good as the original, it's nonetheless a beautiful film. The story's predictable (it's nearly identical to the original) and Emma Watson's performance could've been better.

(spoilers) So did the person who placed the witch go from house to house, asking if she could stay the night then when someone says no they place a curse on them and some random people in the castle. She places the curse on a random kid who probably did not even want to be there. The one part of the movie that could have saved it for me (the singing and dancing) fell flat. They went on and on. I did not really care for anyone. This movie does have good parts, but really a disappointment. Clearly people feel different from the scores it has gotten, but for me I did not like it, you have your own opinion. But it was not for me.",

            "content": "Since the nineteen-thirties, a trend began that has flourished every generation for the last eighty years that has altered the experience of childhood and parenting, the Walt Disney Studios. My daughter has recently married so in our family another generation will be touched by their own favorite Disney film. If you are ever in a group of people including many parents, there is a way to guess the age of their children accurately. Ask them which Disney animated movie their child was infatuated with watching. For my daughter, her childhood encompassed two movies, \"The Little Mermaid\" and \"Beauty and the Beast.\" As this was before the advent of DVDs, so the constant viewings wore out the tapes requiring buying new copies to avoid the ire of a disappointed child. Now that major technological advances have brought filmmaking to previously unimaginable heights, the magic inherent in Disney movie could only be realized through animation. There was no reasonably realistic way to portray a singing candlestick or allow the audience to believe they see an undersea kingdom. With such incredible cinematic techniques as motion capture and computer graphics seamlessly integrated with live-action, whatever a creative mind can imagine can be brought to life on the screen. Disney has always embraced cutting-edge technology, frequently at the forefront of innovation. As part of this new wave of entertainment, they have rereleased many of their most beloved stories as Broadway productions and live action movies. That brings us to the film under consideration, the live-action version of 'Beauty and the Beast.' For the doubters that refused to believe a live action movie could do justice to such a cherished childhood memory then you need a refresher course in modern artistic expression. While this is an extremely well-produced offering it does express one drawback that few fans of the original will find difficult to overlook, it is not that animated film; great effort has been infused in each frame of the movie to be as respectful as possible to the animated feature. No matter what technological achievements in CGI there is something warm and comfortable about Disney animation, after all, they created the format and had been honing their considerable talents since 1937.\n\nSet in pre-Revolutionary War France this incarnation holds to the basic storyline of the fairy tale as rendered by Disney Studios. An elderly beggar woman (Hattie Morahan) arrive at the doors of a castle during the evening of a luxurious ball. The old woman asks the Prince (Dan Stevens), for shelter from the night. In exchange, she offers a beautiful rose. The Prince was self-centered and cold-hearted flatly refusing her request. It turns out that the woman was a powerful enchantress who responds to his cruelty by transforming the Prince into a hideous beast. Her anger extended to the household staff which the witch turned into various household objects. She then proceeds to erase the memory of the castle on their friends and family cutting them off from the world. Her final feat of magic was to seal the enchantments by casting a spell over the entire household connected to the rose. If the Prince does not find true love before the last petal on the flower falls, then their humanity will be forfeited, and the transformations will be permanent.\n\nIn the nearby village of Villeneuve, there lived a young woman named Belle (Emma Watson), who was pretty and intelligent dreaming of leaving her quaint hometown to go out into the world to find adventure. Belle finds herself the objected of the desire of Gaston (Luke Evans), a former member of the military known for his arrogance and narcissism. While no unenhanced human being could achieve the massive physical appearance of the animated Gaston but this casting choice does help establish the requisite infatuation Gaston has with his manly appearance and macho persona. This is indicative of the commitment fostered by the filmmaker and producers to make a reasonable effort to remain true to animated feature while crafting a film that can stand on its own artistic merits. This is a difficult, fine line for a filmmaker to tread, fans understandably set out to experience the live action remake that despite any technological wonders that are among the available cinematic tools. In this endeavor, the results of this balancing act remarkably achieving this goal. The proof of this claim is found in the box office where the opening weekend recouped a substantial profit permitting the remainder of its theatrical run to triple the estimated budget. The icing on this cake is the critical community upheld the acceptance.\n\nThis story is undoubtedly the epitome of a romantic tale. It represents one of the most poignant reimaginings of the perennial classic, 'Romeo and Juliet' with the feuding house replaced by incompatible species. The naïve young girl pampered and sheltered with a young woman with a quick wit and innate intelligence. Ms. Watson certainly was ideal for this role. She is the opposite of the stereotypical child star. While so many descend into drugs, alcohol and salacious behavior, Ms. Watson managed to avoid becoming tabloid fodder pursuing an undergraduate degree from graduated from Brown University. She is poised and articulate, passionate about her role as the United Nation's special ambassador championing women's equality. Ms. Watson confers a sense of wonderment on Belle, whose intrinsic compassion and strong sense identity allowed her to reach beyond the grotesque physical appearance of the beast and the underlying feeling of entitlement of his princely persona to see a sensitive person capable and worthy of true love. Some were quick to denounce the character of Belle as a victim of Stockholm Syndrome where a hostage gains feelings towards the captor. Ms. Watson defended her position is contrary to this interpretation defending her position with style, grace and a touch of panache. Of course, she has many years of experience with green screen is driven sets and stories requiring bringing the audience into a fantasy excepting it as readily as on set in the real world.\n\nAny romantic story must adhere to a rather strongly preset checklist of requirements that brings the audience on an emotionally intense journey. This movie achieves this handily with a realistic chemistry generated between the leads. This is naturally crucial in any story especially one dealing with romantic tribulations. The infusion of fantasy as an underlying theme defining the parameters of the story the connection to even a modicum of reality becomes overwhelmingly essential. Fantasies are nice, they ae immensely enjoyable much like a pleasant dream. To retain a strong and lasting impression on members of the audience, it is imperative to create an emotional connection. This is best accomplished when the audience can imagine themselves personally in the situation unfolding before their eyes. The film comes very close to an ideal juxtaposition of reality and fantasy to generate a synergy that carries the film as a truly worthy emotional voyage.",

The set and costume designs are all incredible, and each member of the cast does a fine job. Special praise should be equally given to Watson, Evans, Gad, and Stevens. Hearing these classic Disney songs being recited beautifully by these actors will surely bring a smile to viewers' faces, especially if they were a child when the animated film was released, or even had a child during that time who is now grown. Colorful and creative visual effects also accompany these numbers, and they're a joy to look at.

So, what to expect when one of the Twilight Saga franchise directors takes on this project? Well, you can always pray hoping it to be more like Dreamgirls than Twilight movies! \nBut, truth be said, Beauty and the Beast honours its source material quite well! \nIn fact, Beauty and the Beast could be a dark tale of love, but Condon manages to turn it into a true musical and that's why it worked so well: 1991's Beauty and the Beast was a musical \"Disney princess\" movie and the 2017's live-action version works so nice because it uses the very same music and some iconic songs that made the original such a \"magic\" piece of cinema. Production design work is simply beautiful and the same can be said about the costume design - both contributing for the (re)creation of a magnetic fantasy world. \nThe ensemble cast feature some of the best individual works from some of its actors: Josh Gad is scene-stealing, Luke Evans turns Gaston into an even more memorable alpha-male cartoon but somehow he manages to be successful and memorable in the part, while Dan Stevens (who showed great promise in 2014's The Guest and in Downtown Abbey TV series) does a nice job by taking the tricky part of The Beast. Emma Watson proves to be one of the most charismatic young actresses working today and not only she's a beauty, but she's a quite decent singer (she's no Paige O'Hara, let's be honest), being able to be more than just a actress who fits the part of Belle - in fact, by playing an engaging feminist heroine, Watson promises us she doesn't need Harry Potter in order to become a major star in the cinematic industry. \nSo, in spite of not being effective to add anything new to the source material (if you exclude the beautiful new ballad \"Evermore\"), this live-action take on such a beloved tale is more of a Beauty than a Beast for sure. It adds nothing and you can call this an \"unnecessary\" retelling or an easy \"money-making strategy\" from Walt Disney studios, but it shows a clear effort to honour the original and to remind us of the \"inner beauty thing\" (and it stills a better option at the theaters than what we can consider \"cinematic trash\").\n.\n3.5/5\n.\nOriginal review: cinemaandpopcorn.blogspot.pt",

            "content": "Já sem grande memória do clássico de 1991 aventurei-me por esta reencarnação do conto Beauty and the Beast, e fiquei deveras surpreendido. Projetar no grande ecrã os seus filmes de animação, como por exemplo Cinderella (2015) e The Jungle Book (2016), mas desta vez filmados em ação real, é a mais recente aposta da Disney e tem sido criticamente e financeiramente um triunfo. Esta obra segue a mesma tendência.\n\nMaravilhas há a dizer sobre este filme. A história sobre um príncipe amaldiçoado (Dan Stevens) e uma jovem (Emma Watson) que se deixa enamorar. É, na sua essência, um verdadeiro conto de fadas. Assume características de um musical rico em narrativa e personagens únicas, apresenta uma produção luxuosa e envolvente, que me conquistou nos primeiros minutos, e continuou a vislumbrar. Reparo apenas que os cenários em segundo plano pareceram demasiado artificiais em certas cenas.\n\nO romance sucede com a troca de experiências entre as personagens e não apenas porque é necessário que aconteça para avançar o argumento, as atuações foram charmosas e compreendiam em si uma qualidade muito Disney. O diretor Bill Condon orientou bem os atores para performances mais surrealistas, evitando cair no exagero, para não desconectar a audiência das personagens e dos imensos comentários sociais que subtilmente iam sendo feitos.\n\nA profundidade temática está a par com o brilhante aspeto visual. Não só compreende uma história clássica, com números musicais soberbos (uns mais que outros, é certo), como também invoca mensagens extremamente contemporâneas. Aceita, sem remorsos, personagens homossexuais, encara as figuras paternas como pessoas quentes e próximas dos filhos, promove a tolerância e a ilusão das primeiras impressões. Tudo isto em apenas pouco mais de 2 horas. \n\nBeauty and the Beast é um filme muito envolvente e relacionável, conseguindo trespassar plenamente a magia desta história tão velha quanto o tempo. É uma conquista de grupo, desde a animação dos objetos ao monstro, passando pelo guarda-roupa e caracterização das cenas. A dinâmica da produção foi essencial para conceber este belo mundo de fantasia que é uma autêntica terapia para a alma.\n\n8,5/10",

The storyline, even with its new plot additions, was still captivating; and those classic songs by Menken are literally timeless and perfect. But my goodness... this movie needed some sparkle. Emma Watson was hardly comparable to Belle's riveting, wide-eyed pulchritude. The sad thing is the right kind of makeup and hair styling could have easily transformed her into the perfect Belle, but the folks who were hired for that job failed miserably. Emma looked plain and drab, sometimes even oily and disheveled, which kind of defeats her character's purpose. And the yellow ball gown.. what a tragedy. It looked more like a Halloween costume than an actual dress. Why couldn't they hire a renown couturier or fashion designer to make this dress??? Zac Posen. Carolina Herrera. Giambattista Valli. Stefan of and Domenico of Dolce & Gabbana. I mean seriously. That dress needed a lift. The \"Little Town\" opening number in the beginning, lousy. The \"Be Our Guest\" scene, terrible.

The acting and voice over performances were terrific especially from Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, Josh Gad, Emma Thompson, Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Kevin Kline, Audra McDonald, Stanley Tucci, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw. The visuals were phenomenal especially the Beast and all of the inanimate objects that are now alive. The musical numbers were outstanding especially the Be Our Guest number, the Belle number, the Evermore number, and the Aria number. The soundtrack was excellent especially the songs Beauty and the Beast, Evermore, How Does a Moment Last Forever, Be Our Guest, Belle, and Something There. The soundtrack is my favorite Disney soundtrack, my 2nd favorite soundtrack of all time, and one of my favorite albums of all time. The score was fantastic. The costumes were remarkable especially Belle's gold dress, Belle's blue dress, Madame de Garderobe's blue and gold dress, Gaston's outfit, and Plumette's blue and white dress. The sets and scenery were wonderful especially the beautiful castle that the Prince/the Beast, his workers/the inanimate objects, and later Belle live in together.

This adaptation rides high on that nostalgia, delivering on the story we love, with some extra bonus stuff thrown in to make sure we hit that feature-length runtime.\n\nI will spare you the story, because you almost certainly know it. I really like how little it deviates from the original. The songs are all there, the characters are well-realized, even many of the shots are the same. The relationship between Belle and her father is done very well, as is the relationship between her and the Beast.\n\nThere are a couple of new songs to pad the runtime. While they are well-performed, I don't know if it makes the move flow as easily as it could. I did enjoy the opening scene, fleshing out what was only told in stained glass in the original. Also, some of the songs were reworked to make them longer, which made some of the lyrics and editing less tight.\n\nThere's a mixed bag of acting here. Emma Watson is great, but her singing voice leaves something to be desired. I really enjoyed Dan Stevens as Beast. Kevin Kline is also great as Maurice. While Luke Evans gives his all as Gaston, I disagree with the decisions they made (he should have been a bass, not a tenor). Josh Gad is well-cast as LeFou. Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen play off each other very well as Lumiere and Cogsworth.\n\nNostalgia is definitely a main reason why I enjoyed this. However, nostalgia for a great film still makes a memorable experience, even if it can't possibly live up to the magic of the original.",

You know, the most famous scene of the movie besides the ballgown scene. Oh! Speaking of, great idea to make the dress CG as well, nobody noticed at all. the beautiful empty backgrounds and extremely boring choreography totally took our attention away from the obviously computer generated garment. \n\nHonestly, the only good thing I can say about this movie was the casting. Mostly. Everyone was very good, I loved Kevin Kline as Maurice. But Jesus Mary and Joseph, who decided Emma Watson would be a good Belle?! There are literally thousands of actresses who actually care to act most of the time, who are also musically inclined. Do they not count? Does it cost less to autotune a pretty face? \nThere were only what, 4 or 5 actual actors in the movie that could actually sing? They barely got any screen time at all. What's the point?! They even got Bill Condon to direct! The same man who brought us Chicago and Dreamgirls. This is what he came up with?! Was he given $5 And a cheeseburger and a month to make this? I could have made better without the $5! \n\nDisney. We love you, but stop ruining perfectly beautiful movies to make money. \nIf Lion King is a ruined masterpiece, I will just give up hope that Disney is good at all.

I know, it's just an animated version but with Disney making live action versions of our beloved childhood memories that is Disney animated films, I just gotta. This is one of the best of Disney's own take of fantasy tales. We all know the story and if you haven't yet then you are in for your treat. If you have watched animated version of the story, you might still end up loving the classic. The live action is not that bad but it could have been better.\n\nTheir pick for Belle was questionable but Emma Watson did it well, nonetheless. The portrayal of other characters such as the Beast for example is kinda strange to me. The romance between Belle and the Beast is somewhat weak. I didn't feel the magical, typical romance in the air vibes like I did with the cartoon. Maybe because I'm so accustomed to such a nice frivolous classic that I couldn't stand some of the things  in the live action movie. But let's not imply that I didn't like the movie at all. It's just good. That's it and that's the problem. There were a few songs I've never heard of and some of them looked like it was just there to make the movie longer. The enchantress, the witch, her spotlight was so small that she didn't really need to be in the movie anymore. She didn't really have to appear again. I mean, she didn't appear anyways in the animated version. But I guess I understand that characters need some kind of development, even if it's so small. Still, unnecessary stuff shouldn't be showcased to look like it's necessary. It's just an excuse.\n\nHowever, the live action Beauty and the Beast had a few twist and turns and even interesting different point of views. This sets aside for being too comparable to the animated version. Which I think that's probably what Disney is doing. Bringing life to these animated versions to live action and make them a little more realistic. After all, they can't replicate like the animated versions can they? Well if you have watched The Mask, it's a great example that they can. Aladdin live action will have to do more than just being a realistic, since the Genie is the biggest comic relief character in the story. It goes the same with Cogsworth and Lumiere. Interesting choice of actors and they still capture the essence of how these characters are. Don't get me wrong, the Beast could have been more...Beast but this version was interesting too. One thing that took me by surprised is having more background information of Belle's parents, especially her mother. I thought that was pretty good and the song performance was well put as well.\n\nBeauty and the Beast is both beautiful and terrible at the same time. When you have those two mixed in together, you can be my guest. Come join the party and meet the rest :)",

            "content": "Tale as old as time, abusive relationships. Yup, if you know me and the gist of my reviews, you probably guessed that I didn't enjoy the new Beauty and the Beast remake, which came out March of this year. I also didn't enjoy the animated one, but at least the animated one lets you make fun of it. This one tries to patch up everything wrong with the original one and fails miserably. I guess it's important to mention that the original one came out in 1991 and was the first animated movie to be nominated for a best picture award at the Oscars. The animated picture category at the Oscars didn't start until 2001. I was anxious to watch this movie because I was so excited for it to be on my list of movies I love to hate. However, it was so bland and forgettable that the only emotion that it evoked from me was, meh.\n \nBefore I start, let's talk about Emma Watson. Her performance is passable. I liked her as an actress in Harry Potter, not so much in this movie or her previous role in Perks of Being a Wallflower. I'm not on her hate train, but I didn't think anything she said to the press justified her being in this film. She's a feminist and fights for rape victims and victims of domestic violence, yet she's in a movie about Stockholm Syndrome! The actor who played the Beast is extremely bland as well. He's just every other blue eyed blonde haired actor in Hollywood. To be honest, I forgot the Beast had a human form! Seeing the human playing the beast at the end is always jarring, but this time it was even more so. The Beast is extremely flat, it never feels like he's there. It never feels like the characters are anywhere but a sound stage. The only characters that give life to this film is the furniture because they're CGI, therefore, they can fit into the backgrounds seamlessly. That's not saying much since they're mostly extremely creepy. Without further adieu, here is Beauty and the Beast.\n \nI'm not going to rehash the plot because you probably know it already. I will mention however, the things they've changed to try to make the movie \"better\" and the things they added to make it more \"modern.\" Firstly, racism doesn't exist as we see in the first scene, which takes place in the ball room of the Prince's palace. We see white, African, and maybe Asian princesses vying for the Prince's attention as equals. At the ball, African German opera singer Audra McDonald performs an over the top number. Plumette, the feather duster and Lumiere's love interest, is an African English woman played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw. I guess racism can't exist in this world because there's a Beast in it. They also want a diverse cast where the POC aren't servants or \"less than.\" But seriously, ignoring racism in a fantasy world is really annoying because there needs to be at least some realism in these films. Ray Fearon plays the wise black man who no one listens to. He also helps Belle by giving her books to read and encouraging her to teach other girls to read. I guess there's a good message in there, but it's never addressed again. Belle's need to better the village is thrown away in the 2nd and 3rd acts because she's trapped in the castle. In the first act, she's shown teaching a girl to read and then is ostracized for it, but she never goes back to the little girl to teach her to read, or use her new found title as Queen/Princess to try to change the town's mind. She just gives up because she's too ahead of her time and no one understands her. There are two interracial couples in the film, which is cool but also proves there's no racism in their world.\n \nThey also try to justify things that weren't clear in the first one, like why doesn't anyone remember the beast and that they have a king? Well, that's because the Enchantress made everyone in the castle forget the people they loved in the outside world and vice versa. They never actually say who was governing during that time. They also make it clear that the only animate objects in the house were once people, and that inanimate objects stayed inanimate. Yet, that doesn't change anything because in the Be Our Guest scene every fork, knife, and spoon dance around as if they were real. They can't ALL be real. Not to mention the champagne even has arms in that sequence. They also give an origin to why Belle wanted her father to bring a rose to her. It's because her father, who's an artist in this version rather than an inventor, painted a portrait of her and her mother before her mother died and it had a rose in it. Maurice, the father, keeps Belle's mother's story hidden in the shadows for some reason. We later find out he left her mother because she had the plague and she didn't want it to spread to him and Belle. Why did Belle need to discover that through the Beast?! Why did Maurice need to hide that information from her? Belle discovers this because the Enchantress gave the beast a magical book where he could go anywhere in the universe and Belle chooses to go see her mother and what happened to her.\n \nNow time for LeFou. He's not over the top feminine and stereotypically gay, but he's still feminine so we can identify him as such. I guess there's no racism in this world, but homophobia is still a thing, and beasts exist. Okay? Like make up your mind! Anyway, he doesn't do anything \"outwardly gay\" (whatever that means). There's no groundbreaking moment that we should all applaud for, he's the exact same character from the first one except has more morals and intellect. He's not a fool in this version at all. He's not clumsy, but he is in love with Gaston, but later realizes the monster that Gaston is. There is one scene where a man is cross dressed and he likes it, so I guess they're breaking the gender binary that way?\n \nNext, the farm she lives on isn't a farm. In this rendition, she lives in the middle of the town. In the original, she lived on a farm away from the rest of the village so we could identify her as an outsider. I laughed when she said she was a farm girl because their \"farm\" is a little patch of grass in front of the house.\n \nThey do talk about women's positions in society as being less than, so that's good, kind of? They talk about how women reading is unacceptable and women who remain unmarried become spinsters. Okay, so they have sexism, homophobia, but not racism, how does that work? Anyway, this is only shown to make Belle a \"feminist\" and a \"strong independent woman\" for wanting to read and not marry. It also is to show us that she's an outsider. But after the first act when her \"character\" is set up, her love of reading is never really explored. Only when she sees the Beast's library and learn that he loves to read too, and doesn't mind women reading/being educated, does this become an important plot point. Her \"feminism\" is only there to make a connection to the Beast, not for her own character advancement. She says she doesn't want to marry and wants to leave the town in the first act, and the latter she does, not so much for the former. But I don't think being captured by a beast was what she meant by \"more than this provincial life.\"\n \nThe enchantress could also change the weather in the surrounding area of the castle, so it's eternally winter. This is a clever trick because we really don't know how long Belle is trapped in the castle. It could be a few weeks or days or months. But if you pay attention, the events only take around a month. She's his prisoner for maybe 3 weeks, Maurice makes it back to the village around the third week, Gaston ties him up to a tree for five days, on the sixth day he's rescued by Agatha (the village spinster) and Gaston tries to get Maurice committed. Belle comes back either the same or next day her father is committed because she's freed by the Beast. She makes it back in one day and realizes she fell in love with her captor, and returns to him for the final climax.\n \nI guess I do like the castle design. I think it's nice how the castle is closing in on itself. It's grotesque and crumbling. It feels like a prison, which it is. A downside is that these new movies make you want to see the old ones again - that's Disney's perpetual cycle it wants to put its viewers in. They want to make these things \"timeless\" so they can keep taking your money forever.\n \nThere's a second Bestiality moment with the feminine peacock feather duster Plumette. She's a bird, and Lumiere is a man attached to a candle. At least in the first one it was a feather duster without an animal body. But then again, at least this one isn't as oddly sexual as the first one. But all in all, I hate Lumiere. The wardrobe is weird AF. It looks scary and unpleasant. Same with the coat hanger, the tea pot, and Chip. Things that look good and cute with hand drawn animation doesn't necessarily look good with CGI.\n \nThey also try to answer the question of why the objects were cursed along with the Prince. The objects are cursed because they didn't help the Beast when he was being abused after his mother died. After she passed, his father started to abuse him (presumably). In the film, they say his father made his son \"as cruel as he was.\" I guess he did that through violence which is why the Beast became so cold. He is a victim of domestic abuse, but that doesn't give him the right to abuse others. I guess people try to justify her not having Stockholm syndrome because she comes back to him on her own terms and she never knows about the curse and needing to fall in love with him, so she really does it unknowingly, but in reality, she was his prisoner. That could never turn out to be a healthy relationship. It's not up to her to fix him and make him whole, or even justify his actions as a Beast. Women aren't there to solve men's problems, especially when they're abuse victims themselves.\n \nIn addition, the movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long. It could and should be 1 hour and 30 minutes, but it adds so many unnecessary songs and scenes to make it \"deep\" and flesh out the characters because they're so wooden, that it becomes boring. One new song they added was Days in the Sun to help Belle cope with her weird feelings about the Beast after learning he was abused. She begins to love him because he's sad and disturbed and she feels like she needs to help him. In addition, she could have just left him in the snow to die and be eaten by wolves, but because she's so pure she decides to help him and stay in the castle with him.\n \nLike I said before, fantasy needs more realism. The backgrounds are shitty and Emma Watson should be cold! She's never cold. She should be bundled up in fur, not wearing a simple cloak. It looks like they're not even outdoors for god sake! There's another lame addition which I mentioned earlier, and that's the book. It's only there for the Beast to realize Belle comes from a good family and that her father isn't a thief for wanting to steal the rose for Belle. It's also there for her to appreciate the present. Like \"hey, I could have had the plague and died. I'm in such a better place now.\" Not to mention, she should have missed her father THEN, not after the ball.\n \nThe next addition is the beast's solo. He sings when he \"let's her go.\" I guess it's just there to show how much he truly loves her and that doesn't see her as his prisoner anymore, or a way to escape an evil curse. Actually, the Beast never tells Belle about the curse or the rose, so in this one, you can really argue she loves him and he loves her. But that doesn't really work in their prisoner/guard relationship. Also, is the Beast faking his feelings for her? What if someone really loved him, but he didn't love them? Gaston is as evil as the beast. But he's only evil so Belle has no prospects, it's just the beast or Gaston. When in reality, Gaston should be the hero, but because he's so much of an evil asshole, he's not. But to be honest, even her father was like \"what the fuck, you love him now?\" when Belle returns to save him.\n \nOverall, I give the film a 4/10. It's watchable, but not for the right reasons. Don't let the songs, and dresses fool you, Belle is a victim of Stockholm syndrome and the Beast is, well, a BEAST!",

            "content": "A lot of women are begging to watch the live-action version of Beauty and the Beast which I guess Disney is doing live-action films based on the animated films which Disney has made in the past decade. Mainly because they think they're better than the animated classics or they're not as good as the animated one's. Maybe I'm one of those people who think they're not as good as the original's. But now my sister put me a digital download of the live-action of Beauty and the Beast and had me watching all the way through. So, what did I think of it? Well, I gotta say, I love it! I am so dazzled and thrilled by this film. My sister Jade made me watch it because she thinks it's beautiful and dazzling. Even I thought about as well. The colours from this film are absolutely gorgeous and the CGI is also good as well. The songs are still the same, not as good as the original. Like Jade showed me the song called ''Gaston'' where Gaston and Lefou singing but some lyrics in this don't match up like ''I needed encouragement, thank you Lefou.'' ''Well, there's no one as easy to bolster as you!'' and they're dancing on the table which reminds me of the theatre play based on this movie. Not to mention that Jade said that the acting is brilliant. And she showed ''Be Our Guest'' with some absolute dazzling colours in it. It's just unbelievable! The rest of the songs are memorable like the original but two of them are not in the original. Or is it three of them? Three of the songs are called ''How Does A Moment Last Forever'' ''Days In The Sun'' and therefore ''Evermore''. ''Beauty and the Beast'' is sung by Emma Thompson who is the voice of Mrs Potts and the ending credits Ariana Grande and John Legend. Right now I can't that song out of my head where Beast played by Dan Stevens singing ''Evermore'', believing the fact that the song in the end credits is sung by Josh Groban. It reminded me of Quasimodo singing ''Out There'' from The Hunchback of Notre Dame. I can't stand new songs but ''Evermore'' is the one that will be stuck in my head for weeks the same way ''Gaston'' will be, along with the other songs from this. Even the music sounded exactly the same, (like the most part) from beginning to end. It's Alan Menken. I think Ariana Grande and John legend will be the next Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson, much like Celine Dion had already sung ''How Does A Moment Last Forever''. No matter what I can say, the songs will be stuck in my head forever much like the original like ''Gaston'' where the lyrics are hilarious like the part which I've been singing along to is this ''As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating!'' and the funniest part which I never expected is this, ''Too much?'' ''Yep!'' Haha, that has me laughing. I I have been teasing Simon and Meg about the live-action version by saying ''When it was announced it was Beauty and the Beast. Many fell into despair and lost all hope, for who could ever learn to love a Disney reboot. However, from one critic, he has a bigger question in mind.'' ''What the fxxk is the point of rebooting Beauty and the Beast?'' I won't go in too much detail what I just said to tease Meg and Simon. Great cast in this like Dan Stevens, Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, A women's interest Luke Evans, Josh Gad and my favourite actor, Kevin Kline. It's directed by Bill Condon, the same guy who directed The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 and 2, which many people think The Twilight films are absolutely sxxt and god-awful. I don't understand that Lefou is gay would be a controversial. I didn't even see it, but who cares. The box office results are absolutely mind-blowing. It earned more than $ 1.263 billion over the $160 million budget while the original earned $425 million. That's a damn impressive feet! Well, I gotta tell you, guys, I really love this movie. While I still prefer the original animation, the visuals are good, the characters are the same, the songs are unforgettable much like the animated version, it has great singing voices, the acting is the best and the ending is just beautiful. Meg Gummerson and my sister Jade Oakey is a huge fan of this movie. Meg Gummerson, if you're looking at this, I just want you to know, Congratulations. And you, Jade, All I'm going to say to you, Jade, is thank you for making watch the live-action version of Beauty and the Beast. You made me smile all the way through the film. God Bless England.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, we just saw a remake of an old classic.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) As the song says,  Be our guest   and put our patience to the test. Let s recap:\n\nSCOTT: In France, a beautiful and mysterious enchantress (Hattie Morahan) disguised as a beggar interrupts a party hosted by a selfish prince (Dan Stevens). The enchantress punishes the prince for failing to help the beggar. She transforms him into a beast until he learns to love another and earns love in return. All of his servants are converted into objects around his castle and will not revert back to human form unless the spell is broken.\n\nGREG: We re introduced to young Belle (Emma Watson). She s a bookworm who can t help falling into song at the drop of a hat. The local townspeople think she is quite odd with her book learnin  and all. She is also without a mother but is the daughter to the local inventor, Maurice (Kevin Kline). He s a bit of a kook too. Well, one day he is on his way to the city to sell his tinker toys when he happens upon a castle with a beast in it. He s thrown in the dungeon, because he stole a rose. Meanwhile, Maurice s horse has returned home without him and Belle is worried. She mounts the horse and rides off to find her father. She finds him locked up in the castle. The beast claims that Maurice must stay. But Belle makes a deal to trade places with her father. And thus begins the oldest story of Stockholm Syndrome ever - a tale as old as time.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, this modern live-action version of Beauty and the Beast is a gorgeous spectacle that leaps off the screen and comes alive musically and visually. My main problem is with the story, which you mention, is that it is a creepy tribute to the Stockholm syndrome that reinforces the subjugation of women. If you can get past this problem and focus on the many positive elements of the storytelling, then there is much to appreciate here. My favorite part of the movie is a scene early in the story in which Belle s father describes Belle in terms that describe a hero to a tee   Belle is odd, fearless, and ahead of her time. Apparently these same traits describe Belle s mother, demonstrating the important role of mentoring in producing a hero. Later we learn that the Beast was raised by a father who was cruel, again underscoring the pivotal role of parenting in developing heroes.\n\nGREG: I loved this movie when my daughters watched the animated version in the 90s as little girls. The animation and the music made it a delight. And the running time of just over 90 minutes also made it tolerable for even adults. But this new incarnation clocks in at about 130 minutes and in this case more was not better. I was bored by the extended musical numbers that went on for 5 minutes or longer. And the new songs and plot elements seemed to be mere padding. I much more enjoyed the economical storytelling of the original animated feature. Having said that, Disney has created a marvel of CGI. The animated characters in this story truly came to life. I m constantly amazed at the quality and extremes of computer generated images in modern films. If I was bored by the longish storytelling, I was impressed with the craft.\n\nSCOTT: You re right, Greg, this movie was much like the character of Gaston and fell in love with itself by running about 10 or 15 minutes too long. This problem is endemic to all of Hollywood s offerings and not just this film. Like you, I was sufficiently dazzled by the CGI to leave the theater content that I got my money s worth. The hero of this story is the Prince who commits a moral transgression at the film s outset and must redeem and transform himself to right his wrong. The key to his transformation is Belle, who transforms him by demonstrating a morally wondrous act of self-sacrifice to save her father. After witnessing this act, the Prince/Beast then does something similar in saving Belle from the wolves. This sets in motion the romance that ultimately redeems the Beast. We ve seen women occupying the role of transformer many times in the movies. Apparently, in the movies and perhaps in storytelling in general, men need women to change them. This is often the formula in romantic comedies in which women fall in love with flawed men and somehow change them. I have to admit I m not a fan at all of this kind of transformation in storytelling, and yet I can t deny its pervasiveness in stories and fables throughout history.\n\nGREG: I think the hero of the story is Belle. It is Belle s perspective the story asks us to take on. In our book Reel Heroes & Villains we identify two types of heroes: transformed heroes and catalytic heroes. The transformed hero is changed by her experience. But the catalytic hero is a catalyst for change in others. Belle is the latter. She is the agent for change in the beast. It is by her love that the beast comes to care about someone other than himself. He changes from being a selfish cad to putting Belle s needs before his own. It s a powerful story dynamic. And since we re studying transformation this year, there s a lot of transformation going on in Beauty and the Beast. As discussed, the prince is transformed from selfish to caring. But Belle undergoes a transformation as well. While she starts out as being kind, thoughtful, intelligent, and caring, she also starts out hating the beast. And ultimately she comes to care for and love him. And while she transformed the beast, she also was the agent of change for all the animated objects in the castle and ultimately the townspeople. There s a lot of transformation in this story. But not all transformation is good. Unfortunately, Disney is in love with the premise that ugly people are bad and beautiful people are good. The prince is evil during his beast phase and when he is changed into a kinder, gentler beast, he magically transforms into a beautiful young man. As a professor of psychology I d like to hear your thoughts on this. Do people generally think that beautiful people are naturally more virtuous?\n\nSCOTT: Yes, research on the halo effect shows that people assume that beautiful people are also good people. This story deserves credit for demonstrating that we can look past ugliness and see inner beauty, but shame on this story for ending the tale with the ugly beast being transformed back into a handsome prince. A better lesson for all of humanity would be for Belle to live happily ever after with inner beauty, not outer beauty. Overall, Beauty and the Beast is a visual and artistic triumph that tells an ancient story quite well despite its unfortunate glorification of the Stockholm syndrome along with the hypocrisy of outer beauty signifying inner beauty. There is an excellent hero s journey here, with the Prince s mistake at the film s outset setting in motion a heartfelt story of redemption and transformative love. The music here is moving, the casting with Emma Watson and Dan Stevens is perfect, and the visuals are breathtaking. I award this film 4 Reels out of 5. While the Prince/Beast is the main hero, it s more accurate to say that he and Belle form a romantic duo hero pairing which we describe in our last book Reel Heroes & Villains. The giveaway that they are romantic heroes lies in the fact that they hate each other at the beginning and grow to love each other by the end. The Prince/Beast does most of the transforming; he learns how to love. Belle is his mentor, demonstrating how one loves through loyalty and self-sacrifice. It s a nice hero story and deserves a hero rating of 4 points out of 5. The transformation of the Prince is, of course, the centerpiece of the tale, and we ve discussed it in this review at length. Earlier I described women in storytelling as being the catalyst of male transformation, and I left out the main female transformative agent that sets everything in motion. I m referring to the enchantress, who transforms the Prince into the Beast and who later rescues Belle s father thus assisting (albeit indirectly) the Beast s transformation back into a Prince. This story is saturated with transformation and as such I ll award it 5 Transformation points out of 5.  Movie: Transformation: Heroes:\n\nGREG: Beauty and the Beast is a feast for the eyes, but plods along at a snail s pace. Emma Watson is delightful as always and the CGI of the beast, the enchanted castle, and its inhabitants is without peer. Still, I can t get past the long running time and needless additional scenes and songs. I give Beauty and the Beast just 3 out of 5 Reels. There s little doubt in my mind that Belle is the hero of the story. Surely there were dozens of little girls dressed as princesses in the theater and not one beast. Belle is nearly too perfect and virtuous. The villain is the beast and it is Belle s virtue that transforms him. I give her 4 out of 5 Heroes. As you point out, Scott, there are plenty of transformations in this film. In our book we identify 5 different types of transformation. We see both physical and emotional transformation in this story. And you might argue for some intellectual transformation for the townspeople as well. I give the transformations 3 out of 5 transformation  deltas.   Movie: Transformation: Heroes:",

You keep stereotyping gay ppl you're gonna continue the same issues). But anyways Gaston not stabbing Beast & falling to his doom sucked to & the Enchantress reappearing at the end was also stupid. This was just another way to make money which is agonizing for me as a Disney fanatic. Stop trying to sell the movie & just make great art.

            "content": "Disney is back with another live-action adaptation of one of their animated films. This time it was up to ''Beauty and the Beast'' to be remade and please the audience. \n\nBut if we look at the final product that the film is, it seems to be that Disney did it more for the money than for the audience. Will the audience end up roaring for the new film or will it just be Disney happily roaring their victory over their audience? I think we all know the answer to that question.\n\n''Beauty and the Beast'' is directed by Bill Condon and tells the tale of Belle. Belle (Emma Watson) is a young adult, who loves to read books and dreaming of playing a part in the adventures that are depicted on those pages. But when she leaves her small village to find her missing father (Kevin Kline), she encounters a large castle in which lives a horrifying Beast (Dan Stevens). As Belle stays with the Beast, she learns that true beauty is found within.\n\nRight from the beginning, the film wants to make very clear what kind of a jerk the Beast was before he came a Beast. Just like in the original animated film, where they spend a short monologue on the case. However, in this live-action adaptation they take more then a few minutes to make it clear that the Beast is a jerk. The problem is not that it is not well done, because making the Beast look arrogant is something the movie does is quite well, but the problem is that right from the beginning one of our main characters is an unlikeable prick, which creates a situation wherein you cannot root for the Beast to become normal again. You want him to stay a Beast, because that's what he honestly deserves to be. He acts like a Beast for the first two acts of the movie. Then the filmmakers remembered that the Beast also must become a human at the end, so they quickly shoved moments in the movie trying to make the Beast look less like a prick and more like an misunderstood young adult. In the original animated film, the Beast had a compelling arc. In this film he does have an arc, but it's not compelling because the Beast is arrogant throughout most of the film and acts like a prick to everyone around him. The arc is also rushed to the point that it makes you care even less for the Beast. Do you want examples of how much of a prick the Beast is? Well, the Beast doesn't even give Belle a minute to say goodbye to her father, the Beast keeps correcting and interrupting Belle, the Beast wouldn't give Belle a room, the Beast forces Belle to eat with him and lets her starve when she says she won't eat with him etc. The thing with this movie is that they like to exaggerate everything the original did, to the point that this movie feels more like a dark cartoon then the original did.\n\nThe scriptwriters Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos also try to add new story elements to the script. There is a new back-story how both Belle and the Beast lost their mothers and it adds nothing new to the story. The scriptwriters probably did this trying to make the Beast, after first writing him as such an unlikable character, look more sympathetic and to give Belle an arc. Only thing is that the new back-story doesn't make Beast look more sympathetic, he still comes across, as a bitter young adult and Belle never gets a conclusion to her arc. Her mother died when she was just a baby. Belle never knew her mother and this has had a great impact on her. However when she finally finds out, what happened to her mother, the subplot is quickly moved aside to continue the main story. Her arc is never resolved or even started to be honest. It just a waste of time.\n\nThe script also tries to give Belle more personality. They did this by making her amazing in everything. She is good in reading, good with children, good in teaching, good in inventing, good in drawing, good in taming wild beasts (get it?). However, as expected, being good in everything doesn't count as a trademark for a character. She isn't Leonardo Da Vinci. Belle is a dreamer, who gets inspired by the books she reads. Belle is intellectual. Indeed. But in this movie they exaggerated her intelligence to the point that this Belle feels more like a cartoon character then her animated counterpart.\n\nThere are also some continuity errors. Belle on Phillipe, the horse, move like the Flash when needed. Belle just arrives shortly after the villagers arrive at the castle, while the villagers had a big head start. The sound effects are also sometimes off in the final battle. Oh right, forgot. To please the immature and the children, the movie also includes butt and poop jokes. Yeah!\n\nThere is also a mystery subplot for the character Agathe, which turns out to be the witch that cursed the Beast. This is so poorly done and unnecessary. She just comes and goes when the story needs her to come an go. And her importance to the story is never explained. Which leaves another unsolved subplot.\n\nThe CGI in this film is, in contrary to the beautiful ''The Jungle Book'', more creepy than fantasy provoking. Nobody wants to see a CGI teapot smiling. They created some nice nightmare related visuals for the younger kids. Can't wait to see this on a childhood trauma list.\n\nNot everything is bad though. The acting is on point. Especially Gaston is likeable, which feels weird because he's supposed to be villain of the film. Well don't worry, because for this first half of the film Gaston comes across as a normal, somewhat dimwitted, individual, but in the second half, he leaves Maurice for the wolves stuck at a tree. Something the animated Gaston would probably also be able to do. The Gaston song is also very amusing. Their is actually an illiterate joke in their that works. The song also contains one exciting, maybe little expectable, but still amusing shot.\n\nIn the end, ''Beauty and the Beast'', is another Disney remake that is poorly executed and is solely done for the money. This movie in particular felt more like a cash grab than the other Disney movies. That is probably because the effect of the original is still untouched by other Disney movies. It is the only animated movie to be nominated for best picture. It is one of the most well known Disney movies. These were the reasons for which Disney thought that their live-action version could earn some big money. Sadly, it did. Overall, it's not a complete failure. There are some genuine emotional moments. Some new interesting ideas, that all don't workout however. And sometimes a joke works. But in the end, the movie is still pretty bad, mostly thanks to the poor script. 4.2/10",

The idea that Disney would feed into this kind of outdated stereotyping angered me. Still, I found myself picking up the blu ray and seeing for myself.\n\nThe film is sumptuous. The opening overture beautiful and promising an experience like West Side Story. While not as inspired or filled with stunning choreography, it is faithful to the original animated work while adding some welcome new songs and moments. The emotion is there, the bombast, the magic, all there. Kevin Kline was a welcome surprise. Emma Watson was perfect as Belle, I even liked her more than before. Dan Stevens was wonderful as well. I noticed more subtle emotion in his face which made me feel a bit more than before. Luke Evans was a presence as Gaston even if his voice was not as hearty or deep. \n\nMy only concern was Angela Lansbury. Why wasn't she Mrs.Potts? I mean, Emma Thompson was fine but she worked so hard to sound exactly like Angela, why not use Angela? She's still alive. The same with Cogsworth. David Ogden Stiers is still alive so why not use him as well? It would have been a touching tribute to the original cast if they had been used. It made me sad. It was hard enough remembering Jerry Orbach's Lumiere but to miss those two characters was almost too much.\n\nStill, the film was gorgeous. The emotion still present and hitting the right chords. I still cried at the end. I still felt joy and love. So I forgive Disney the two flaws I found. Hopefully future projects will be better thought out in those respects.",

Enter a selfless young girl who very much has the potential to do that.  Please believe that Disney is not going to stop their trend of making live action adaptations of their animated classics.  We've already gotten Cinderella and The Jungle Book, and Dumbo and the Lion King are right around the corner.  Whether this is to maintain the rights to the properties or simply feed the cash cow, this will not slow down until Disney has taken over the planet.  Some of these projects are going to be better than others, and I think that Beauty and the Beast is a solid addition to their library.  Now when this first started, I was a little nervous, because I didn't feel that the opening number Bonjour really brought the thunder.  It's already a really strong number, and it didn't pull me into the story with flair like the animated movie or the stage adaptation did.  I feared that this might lack that certain razzle dazzle.  They did figure it out though, and I feel like this gets stronger as the story goes on.  The turning point was right around Gaston's big number, and I thought Josh Gad is well cast as LeFou.  The controversy around the choice to make the character gay is hilarious to me, because if you go back and watch the original animated movie, he's playing the same exact character with the same ticks, he just now has a label.  I liked all of the supporting characters, like Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts and Sir Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, but the standout character for me was Ewan McGregor as Lumière.  He is practically unrecognizable in his voice work, and I wouldn't have thought of him for the role, so kudos to him for doing so much with it.  They manage to make this movie hit notes of sympathy that I didn't expect as this was wrapping up, and I think it is all due to the supporting characters.  I heard a lot of complaints about the CGI beast, and I was expecting to get on board with them; I stage managed a theatrical production of this, so I know that you can do just as much with a guy in a costume.  That said, it didn't really bother me, but maybe that's just because I saw it on a smaller screen rather then in a theater.  I wasn't a big fan of the new songs they added to this.  They were a bit generic, and this is something I don't really understand; you had great source material to pull from the stage production, like \"If I Can't Love Her\" or \"Me\", I don't understand why they settled for less.  When this movie is doing its own thing, it is interesting, but comparing runtimes, it is 84 minutes animated or 129 minutes live action.  I'm glad I watched this, but the quality here isn't high enough to make me ever choose this over the 1991 movie again.",

Along with solid performances by the rest of the well-chosen and selected ensemble cast members.  Although the Prince/Beast could have come off a little less smug and elitist in that ONE scene where he introduces Belle to his large library room in the castle...lol.  I preferred the way that similar library introduction scene was better planned, developed, and played out in the animated version. One minor negative in an otherwise amazing and fabulous movie.\n\nSeeing the \"Be Out Guest\" musical scene in the large dining room table when they are serving Belle dinner in live action and CGI was flat-out amazing. There was such enthusiasm and attention to details placed into the production of that scene, they were able to match and do such justice to the memorable musical scene from the animated version.

This is nothing against an actor that both like and respect, it's simply poor casting in my opinion to have an average sized man singing about being the size of a barge or being an intimidating specimen.\nThe other contributing factor to this films downfall is in addition to the lack of care over the original content taken from the Disney animation, the songs and story which should offer greater depth and give the live film actually end up being mundane, forgettable and ultimately had me checking to see how much more of the film was left to endure.\nI'm sad to say I'm left utterly disappointed by a film that I had such high hopes for.",

            "content": "Beauty and the Beast is the live-action remake of the 1991 Disney animated classic. This is another live action remake following Cinderella, The Jungle Book, and Pete's Dragon. Pretty soon we'll see The Lion King and Mulan come into the spotlight. I remember watching the original repeatedly as a kid. I even saw a high school play, which felt exactly like the movie. It makes sense they remad the previous films they so far released, since they don't get a lot of attention, considering the fact kids aren't familiar with them.\n\n        If you're not familiar with the story of Beauty and the Beast, let me explain it. A rude young prince has been cursed by a powerful enchantress, turning him into a hideous beast. And turning everyone into antiques. A young girl named Belle is a part of a village who doesn't really treat her nicely. Gaston dreams one day for Belle to be her trophy wife. While Belle's father goes off to the market, he finds a mysterious castle home to the Prince. He's taken prisoner as Belle goes off to find her father. Concluding negotiations, Belle gives away her freedom for her father. Now, she and the Beast have to learn to love each other and break the curse the enchantress unleashed.\n\n        Emma Watson as Belle is surprisingly good. I'm glad this film dragged me away from the whole \"Hermione Granger\" feel, because that would've made the movie a disaster. Dan Stevens as the Beast is perfect. It's always great to see this actor on screen.  Ewan McGregor voices Lumiere, and let me tell you, he does not sound anything like Obi-Wan Kenobi from the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. Ian McKellen as Cogsworth is Emma Thompson as Mrs. Pots is calm, sweet, and patient with the Beast. These three brought their characters to life. Luke Evans as Gaston is very funny. He remains one of the best Disney villains to this day. Same with Josh Gad as LeFour, who previously voiced Olaf in Frozen, also makes a funny portrayal. Kevin Kline as Belle's father made a tremendous supporting role.\n\n        The visuals are just outstanding. The set designs, the costumes, the motion capture on the Beast himself. The castle was very-well detailed. Not one bit felt unreal. The antiques are done with some incredible CGI. I personally liked Lumiere the candlestick.\n\n        Just like all remakes, this one is differently from the original. Scenes were identical, yet they made them with a slightly different feel, also the same songs from last time, including \"Be Out Guest.\" Unfortunately, some of it doesn't work. In the original, the Prince was turned into a beast as a child, which makes sense, because he's forgotten what it's like to be human. Here, he's turned into a beast as an adult for.....not too long really. Even new songs are added. Sadly, I only enjoyed one called, \"Evermore.\" This song is becoming a huge hit everywhere. Dan Stevens nailed it. \n \n        Beauty and the Beast is one of the best remakes in a long time. The actors/actresses did a great job with their roles, the visual are astounding, the effects are flawless, and the song, \"Evermore\" is fantastic. If you were a fan of the original as a kid, chances are you'll love this adaptation. It's great for a new generation to watch. I'll be looking forward to their future live-action remakes, next one being Mulan. As for Beauty and the Beast, it deserves an 8.5 out of 10.",

            "content": "It seems as though every movie Disney makes in live-action, it's a remake of one of their animated classics. I have not been a fan of them outside of THE JUNGLE BOOK, which I thought was pretty good. So I was curious to see how Disney would pull off remaking one of my all time favorite animated movies, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.\n\nMany people I know have already asked me what I thought of this movie, so it won't come as a surprise that I didn't like it. But to those who don't know are probably shocked because everybody seems to love it. And I can see why; it has a very nice production design, most of the song sequences are well done, I like how they updated the character of Maurice, and most of the casting is solid. I enjoyed the scenes with Gaston and LeFou, I thought the actors did a great job portraying the characters. They were by far the best part of the movie for me.\nBut what I was looking for was something that THE JUNGLE BOOK did, take on a different direction of the original story while still keeping the charm and charisma of the characters we love. The new BEAUTY AND THE BEAST may still have some of that charm and some of the characters but changes virtually nothing from the original story. Literally scene for scene it is the exact same movie as the original. So much of the dialogue was still unchanged. It almost looked like I was watching a shot for shot remake. At least with the other live-action remakes, they at least did something a little different. It didn't always work, of course, but at least they've shown to take risks, and I respect that. This movie barely took any risks. They just added a few songs, and they were mostly filler.\n\nThat's one of the major problems of the movie for me out of many. Another major problem is, I guess it's just me, I didn't feel any chemistry between Belle and the Beast. The performances were so bland, hardly any emotion comes from them. That's for me one of the strongest points in the original movie, the chemistry between the main couple, and they seem to almost completely forget about it in this movie. The whole time they were on screen, I just got bored. Another big problem is the fact that it's in live-action. Part of the charm and \"beauty\" of the original was the animation. It is gorgeous! It's bright and colorful, you remember what each character looks like, you see and feel their emotions, you see all that effort being put into it, and has the advantage of what can't be done in live-action. When the new movie tries to recreate the nonhuman characters, the CG is not only noticeable, but it sometimes looks kind of creepy when they try to make it look realistic. That takes away the charm of the original. Some things are better off in an animated movie. And also, why doesn't the Beast actually look like a beast instead of some big guy who hasn't shaved or brushed his teeth in a while? Come on, be more creative with his design.\n\nBut for me, the biggest problem of the movie for me is the fact that it was made. Why? What was the point? Did it add anything new, groundbreaking, or even remotely significant to the story? If you told me that the movie was supposed to be the BEAUTY AND THE BEAST movie \"for a new generation\", I'd say you're wrong. Very wrong. The original is the BEAUTY AND THE BEAST movie for every generation. Everybody knows it, everybody loves it, it's a perfect Disney movie, and it was the first animated movie to be nominated for Best Picture! Trying to recreate what was already perfect is one of the biggest mistakes a movie can give. And since this movie made over $1 billion at the box office, Disney is not going to stop remaking their animated classics, and they're going to be the same exact movie. Seriously, Disney, how much more money do you need? You have MARVEL and STAR WARS on your hands! It's ironic that Disney's animated movies, especially their more recent ones, that have no live-action people in it have so much more emotion, passion, and humanity to them than any of their live-action remakes.\n\nNow before anybody kills me, I will give credit where credit's due. It's still in some ways a pretty well-made film. The songs sequences were well done, the scenery was nice to look at, I did laugh at a few parts, and the cast was solid (except for Emma Watson). I guess those who thoroughly enjoyed the movie were those who wanted to enjoy it; and those who didn't, including me, expected it to be the same movie as the original. If that doesn't bother you, then you'll enjoy it. I just wanted something from this movie to show me why it was made in the first place. And I never got it, this movie felt empty to me.\n\nGrade: C",

            "content": "It's funny that last week, I praised the movie \"Sing\" for casting well known actors who could actually sing, which is so rare for a big-budget movie. This movie illustrates my point perfectly. The movie has its merits, but is weakest on its voice talent, which is essential to carry a big sweeping musical like this one. The actors all have passable singing voices, but the only one with a voice strong enough to carry their role is Luke Evans as Gaston. Even Josh Gad is not very strong in this. That being said, the film is a decent \"live-action\" remake of the classic animated film. Though I use that term loosely, as this movie is still about 80% animated...so what exactly was the point of making this movie again? Aside, of course, from the obvious Disney cash grab. You can't help but compare it to the original, and while it's a faithful adaptation (some of it is shot for shot), it falls short in a lot of respects. There are the aforementioned mediocre voice performances, pacing problems (there is a ton of stuff added to beef it up which only end up slowing down the story), and tonal inconsistencies. How do you have a fun song-and-dance number about a vain but harmless buffoon of a character who in the next few scenes suddenly becomes a murderous sociopath? The ending gets really dark, a little too dark, to the point that the moral of the story seems to be that that enchantress was a total epic bitch. On the plus side, there were some changes that I liked better in this version: Belle has more agency, Beast has a back story, and the enchantment/curse is more fleshed out. Also, in this version, they take the time to show how the titular characters end up falling for each other in a way that actually makes sense, while the animated film tried to explain it away in a single 2-minute throwaway song. What the movie really has going for it is how it looks, and it really is gorgeous...but even then, it gets to be too much at times. It's so lavish that it tends to creep over the line into gaudy territory. Sometimes it just tries too hard to top the original, and director Bill Condon seems to have adopted Gaston's philosophy of \"most beautiful = best\". But more is not always better, and the movie would have been more effective if it pulled back a little in places. It's all spectacle with very little else.",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\n1991's 'Beauty and the Beast' is not just my favourite animated film, speaking as a huge animation fan and who loves most of Disney's films, but also one of my favourite films.\n\nExpectations were very much mixed going to see this live-action retelling, having thoroughly enjoyed 2015's 'Cinderella' and 2016's 'The Jungle Book' (which were visually gorgeous and combined old and new while retaining the spirits of their animated counterparts). Also being familiar with Bill Condon's previous work, and finding him a generally promising director and writer. 'Gods and Monsters' is amazing and one of my favourites, 'Kinsey' was interesting and 'Dreamgirls' was elevated by the soundtrack and the cast was quite decent, before he dropped the ball with the last two 'Twilight' films which were not good films at all through no real fault of Condon but with a good deal of everything else.\n\nAt the same time, some of the casting was dubious (Emma Watson is not as bad an actress as many say but to me she just wasn't my idea of Belle, though the likes of Ian McKellen and Emma Thompson promised a lot) and considering that the 1991 film is such a masterpiece in every area (to me the animated 'Cinderella' and 'The Jungle Book' are great films but nothing compared to 'Beauty and the Beast') comparisons were always going to be inevitable. Not comparing was always going to be hard when it was such a staple of my, and many others', childhood. Really questioned the point of it too. Seeing it for myself with no prejudice, and writing this review reading as few reviews as possible, this retelling is not a patch on the 1991 film, it doesn't disgrace it but what worked so well before is missing. On its own terms, it's also very problematic. Just for the record, in no way is it awful, but my feelings were exactly the same as initial expectations, mixed.\n\nStarting with the great things, most of 'Beauty and the Beast' (2017) looks amazing. The set design is colourful and incredibly lavish, with equally gorgeous costumes (especially Belle's yellow ball gown which is even nicer than the dress Watson wore in 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire') and everything is exquisitely photographed. The original songs, some of Disney's finest ever, from the 1991 film are maintained, and as masterful as ever, while the instrumental score is rousing, layered and beautiful.\n\nOf the renditions of the songs, the best one is the Busby Berkeley-inspired jaw-dropping extravaganza \"Be Our Guest\". \"Gaston\" is also enormous fun, and hurrah for one of the best song lyrics ever being kept \"I use antlers in all my decorating\" and while Thompson's performance of \"Beauty and the Beast\" is nothing compared to the iconic one of Angela Lansbury in one of the greatest scenes in all animation it is still poignant.\n\nThe supporting cast do fare better than the leads, with Luke Evans being the standout, performing Gaston with gusto and menace. Josh Gad is great fun as LeFou, and regarding the controversy for me it has been blown out of proportion and nowhere near as explicit as seemingly implied, it's actually pretty subtle and will go over the heads of younger audiences. Ewan McGregor is clearly enjoying himself as Lumiere, despite sporting a dodgy accent (though a French accent is not easy), while McKellen is a wonderfully stuffy Cogsworth, Stanley Tucci is a great addition and Thompson a sincere Mrs Potts. Chip is very cute too, and Lumiere and Plumette's chemistry is sweet and amusing without being creepy.\n\nHowever, am of the opinion that Watson and Dan Stevens are miscast. Watson is far too earnest for Belle and a lot of her line delivery is both forced and phoned in. Stevens often looks stiff and uncomfortable as Beast, being very cheaply made up, and his eyes look dead. Beast was a fascinating character before but has been stripped of his complexity and soul. The chemistry between them, something that would have made or broken the film, isn't there. Audra MacDonald overdoes it in the role of the wardrobe and Kevin Kline tries his best but his Maurice is largely wasted.\n\nSpecial effects and such are a mixed bag. Some of it fares well but some of it looks pretty dreadful, especially Chip, the wolves and Beast. One admires the fact that 'Beauty and the Beast' tries to remain faithful to the animated film, but one can't help feeling that it was too faithful and that the spirit generally was lost in translation. There is not much new, though trying with additional songs that are so lacking compared to the original songs (\"Evermore\" is forgettable and completely lacks impact) and cramming in numerous back-stories that mostly bloats the film and like a rich pudding being over-egged. Belle and Maurice's subplot feels like padding and eats up too much time.\n\nNot all the original song renditions work, with \"Belle\" lacking joy and being pedestrian in staging, \"Something There\" being similarly indifferent and underpowered in singing. The climax, so powerful before with a tense final fight and Beast's death scene and transformation even now reducing me to floods of tears every time, this time round feels like a lukewarm anti-climax. The beautifully crafted script before is both dull and overdone here, the story lacks magic, joy, charm, soul and emotional power that only appears sporadically and the pacing suffers from the film trying to do too much.\n\nIn summary, 'Beauty and the Beast' (2017) looks gorgeous with a strong supporting cast and a few song renditions that come off well but suffers from being over-stuffed, miscast leads and feeling very bland in spirit. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "I think if you asked most people, they will say that they grew up on the old Disney cartoons - Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Bambi, Peter Pan, etc. For people of my generation, classics like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, The Lion King, and of course, Beauty and the Beast, will surely be added to the list. I am no exception. I loved Disney's classic cartoons growing up, and I'm sure, if I returned to them now, I would still find much to appreciate. \n\tI don't find that much to appreciate here, though, in Disney's live-action 21st century update on Beauty and the Beast, directed by Bill Condon and starring Emma Watson as Belle, and Dan Stevens as the Beast. It's hard, I guess, to pick out specific things that were bad or wrong about the film. It's just that there's nothing special here. The story is exactly the same as the far superior 1991 cartoon; Belle's father is kidnapped by the Beast, Belle comes to save him, gets trapped herself, falls in love with the Beast, and then Gaston (Luke Evans), the villain, comes to kill the beast. Of course, he doesn't succeed, and Belle kisses the Beast to transform him back into a man, as well as all of the teacups and clocks back into people too. This was the story of the first, and this is the story of this film. As for the music, I would praise it, as it is very good, but I'd be praising the songs from 1991. There may be an extra number or two in this one, but the only memorable songs are the ones that were written twenty-six years ago.\n\tSo, if it's going to follow the exact formula in terms of story and musical score of the original film, does it offer anything else to make it special? Not really. In fact, I would say that a lot of the magic from the original is gone in this film. I suppose that is inherent in a live action film, but then again, you must ask yourself why they made a live action film in the first place (the answer is money, in case that one had you stumped)? While the candlesticks, clocks, teacups, dressers, and indeed, even the Beast, had very warm and welcoming appearances in the cartoon, here they are cold and impersonal. It's not their fault; the artists try their best to make them as warm and lovable as the cartoon characters, but alas, they fail, especially with the Beast. The artists in 1991 did a great job designing their Beast; he was a creature that could be scary and cold, but then charming and warm when the story needed it. Here, it is simply impossible for the Beast to ever have a welcoming appearance, despite all the work they do with his character to try and make him that. \n\tIn addition, the tone is significantly darker than the first, as one would expect I guess from the live action version. I don't know why the filmmakers decided to do that; it's a children film, after all. Where's the color? Where's the joy? That is disposed of, here, in favor of a bleak and depressing setting.\n\tThe story is well told, and the characters are all strong and developed nicely, but that is an attribute of the first that this one merely copies and makes slightly worse. This is an obvious cash-grab by Disney, who has taken a beloved classic and making it live-action for no real reason but to make money. I objected to 2000's How the Grinch Stole Christmas for many of the same reasons; the 1966 cartoon had color, heart, joy, something nostalgic to look forward to watching when the Christmas season came around. The live-action Grinch, though, was gloomy and dark, with the joy and magic gone. 1991's Beauty and the Beast offered many of the same things, and in the same way, the live-action rendition does away with most of them. \n\tSo in conclusion, the main problem here is that it is live-action, and the tone is much too depressing and bleak, sucking away the charm and magic of the original. Is that a fair criticism? Well, when there is really no purpose for this film to exist other than for Disney to rake in another billion dollars at the box office, and all it does is copy the original frame-for-frame while taking away what made it good in the first place, sure, I'd say it's fair.\n\n--\nRating: 2/4",

Mine was the animated one and then there was a modern-day version called 'Beastly'. Not to forget there's a recent French version made on the big scale that I yet to watch. So it's not about the story at all. It is about the quality of film, performances, and particularly how the modern technology used to narrate the story.\n\nLike the recent Disney's live-actions 'Cinderella', 'The BFG', 'The Jungle Book' and many more, this is another excellently adapted film from the book. Though visually it tried to be true to the original, and that's absolutely great thinking. Because in this modern world, we all try something new out of the original contents for sometimes to mess it up.\n\nExcellent casting, the beauty was the best pick among all. The graphics were awesome. The CGI beast was flawless, yet that usual dark and cloudy atmosphere helped it to be so perfect. Since it is listed under Musical, I was worried about the songs. I truly don't like modern Musicals. But this film was not completely filled with songs. Yes, there were like half a dozen, but good ones. Retained the songs from the 1991 film, and in addition three new were composed.\n\nI did not think the Disney would get away with consecutive successes. Great achievement, and their attempts were very precautionary on their every step. Now this is Disney's second highest grossed film ever and first in live-action. The film was for all ages unlike old Disney films. That's the best thing about the modern Disney films that they have adopted. Definitely recommended for at least once watch it.\n\n8/10",

Emma Watson was a perfect Belle. She was a strong smart woman in this film just like she was in the original. Dan Stevens was excellent as the beast. He made the beast character his own and did well with it. Luke Evans was awesome as Gaston, a villain that we all love to hate. He did really well playing the bad guy in this film and he also was a charming, stylish Gaston. Josh Gad was excellent as LeFou. Going into this film I heard the controversy about his character and I chose to not listen. It's good that I did because he played a good comedic sidekick. He really fit the part. Everyone on the cast were great singers and they fit the songs. The CGi was convincing and well generated. Overall, this is another excellent Live Action Disney Adaptation with an excellent cast and story. An cool experience in the theatres. It's not as good as the original, but it's a cool watch. \n\nRating: 8.8/10",

            "content": "Remaking a film can be thankless task. You stick close to the source material and you're going to piss off fans. If you stray too far, you're going to piss off fans. The best that we, as an audience, can really hope for is that the filmmakers have a clear and solid vision for what they want to do, and that it can be delivered in a satisfying way. That will, more or less, determine your enjoyment of this live-action iteration of Beauty and the Beast. It's almost the same exact story as the animated film, beat for beat, save for about 40 minutes of material tacked on. This creates a very mixed-bag of a film, so let's get into it the \"why.\" I'm not going to go over the plot points, as it's pretty much the same as the original, so let's discuss what differentiates this version from the original.\n\nThe film's beginning is its weakest, as we (after the prologue) open with Emma Watson as Belle singing her way through town, much like the original. This scene falls flat for several reasons - the biggest being that Watson is entirely miscast as Belle. The young actress is talented, no doubts there, but her Hermione shtick doesn't work for Belle. Belle is full of hope and optimism and is capable of infusing those around her with absolute happiness thanks to her charm. Watson, on the other hand, looks like she's going to cry when she's smiling. It doesn't work for the character. That, and the fact the producers felt it necessary to auto-tune her voice to hell and back. Listen, there's no way the vocal performances are going to measure up with the original - we go through that acceptance with every cinematic adaptation of a musical - but it would've been far less noticeable to dub Watson's singing than take her original voice and turn it into something that doesn't even sound human. It's unnatural and completely takes you out of the experience. Sadly, that's just the beginning.\n\nThere isn't one song in this version that measures up to the original. A lot of the original songs are extended, to some degree, and the extensions either mess with the rhythm or just feel tacked on. Completely unnecessary. There are 3 new songs in this film, 2 of which I really enjoyed, but we'll come back to those.\n\nThe next thing I noticed is that this film is oddly shot, feeling more like you're watching a televised stage play than an actual film. Stylistically this idea doesn't stray from many other musicals, but I was oddly conscious of it during most of the song and dance numbers in this film. Then there's the poor art and costume direction. Now, I'm not usually one to pick apart costumes, but when Belle appears in the ballroom sporting that yellow dress, you'll yearn for the animated version. That's saying something! That goes for the CG counterparts of all the characters in the castle. I don't think they should have just regurgitated the original designs, but these designs are much too busy. It's like comparing Michael Bay's Transformers to the original toys - sometimes you can go TOO far and when things are too busy, you lose emotion in the performance. Ironically enough, they have the exact opposite problem with Beast himself. There's a song he sings that's a new addition to this film, and while the song is quite good, his performance deflates it. There's no emotion in his face. I'm not one to say that CG is incapable of capturing a performance (look at the recent Planet of the Apes films), but the animators fail to do so here.\n\nWhile this review sounds like I'm bashing every angle of it, let me say that I was happily surprised by some of the additions to the story. Sure, it's still weird that Belle falls for someone who's okay with kidnapping her father (and eventually her), but this film does a better job of showing us how our heroine empathizes with the inhabitants of the cursed castle. There's also a nice little scene towards the beginning where Kevin Kline, playing Belle's father, sings a tune that alludes to the family's back story. Sadly, they ruin this subtext with a scene later on that shows us that Beast can somehow magically teleport anywhere in the world with a magical book. This kinda ruins the idea that he's imprisoned in the castle, but you win some/lose some with these new additions. In the 'win' category, we have some solid performances from Luke Evans and Josh Gad as Gaston and LeFou. Dan Stevens is fine as Beast, although it's hard to tell how much better his performance may have been before he was CG. And as much as I enjoy Kevin Kline, his character is much less of a bumbling idiot, which I'm not quite sure works as well given the events of the film. Also, it's worth mentioning that Sir Ian McKellen is wonderful as Cogsworth. The rest of the characters pale in comparison to their animated counterparts.\n\nSo at the end of the day, the film came off like a kind of \"concert rendition\" of the original Beauty and the Beast. A novelty to check out and (try to) enjoy, but one that doesn't come close to replacing the original that spawned it. It's not a bad movie by any means, but it takes over 2 hours to tell a story that the animated version did far more efficiently in less the time.",

At times in the beginning, the films seemed shot-for-shot duplicates.  In that light, the live-action music, characters and singing just aren't as \"big\" as those in the animated film.  However, making such a comparison, is not fair to this live-action version, which itself is very fine.  The sets and costumes are spectacular.  The CGI is (mostly) impressive.  (Just avoid looking at the Beast's face throughout the film and you'll think it was faultless.)  The music is marvelous on its own, even if most of the new numbers are lackluster. \nThis version is a definite five-star film on its own, which would be clearly evident it it didn't have to measure up to its predecessor.",

A bit to my surprise I found myself enjoying the musical scenes of the movie the most. The singing, dancing and visuals were spot on in nearly all of them. The visuals overall in the movie I thought were great, the movie certainly had style. The animated characters were a strong suit rather than a weak point. The acting was good, which would be expected with this cast. But there was enough missing that it wasn't great. I think it had to do with synthesis, how it all came together. Perhaps it was drawn out a bit much with not enough material. The crucial tail end of the relationship felt a bit contrived and did not work well. I also did not like the whole concept of the enchantress playing a wicked god who tortures a whole village over nothing important, but perhaps not much can be done about the source material which is a fairy tale. If you like a visually stunning movie with realistic looking animations of everyday objects, a delightfully entertaining musical, solid acting by a stellar cast between musical scenes, and a solid plot that gives its cast some material to work with, clean-cut family fun, and immersion into a medieval fantasy period piece, then I strongly recommend this movie.",

Though it's painfully obvious that Watson's vocal coach was American, both give great performances not just musically but also physically keeping their characters engaged in the moment. Billl Condon (Gods & Monsters, Dreamgirls) has focused direction and his narrative comes through very naturally, giving beautifully nostalgic moments that echo the 1991 animated masterpiece. The cinematography, costume design, and CGI are all Oscar worthy, and is a credit to everyone involved. \n\nThe supporting cast are fantastic and bring further life to their iconic characters. Although nothing stands out, both Evans and Gad deserve a nod for their performances breathing great comic relief into the strong drama woven into the story. And kudos to Emma Thompson holding her own as Mrs. Potts knowing everyone was going to judge her solely by her performance of the title song. \n\nAlan Menken's score is as moving now as it was over two decades ago, and the full soundtrack strikes a lovely balance between the score we revere from the animated film and what feels like the stage show. \n\nAll in all, this is a beautiful and entertaining movie- a treat to watch, sing along with, and just enjoy. The main flaw in the film, however, must be noted- was it necessary? The movie is a grand spectacle highlighting one of the brightest talents in Hollywood in Emma Watson & and VFX work of Digital Domain. But as charming and lovely as it is, it still already existed in more or less the same format. And that's what keeps this from being \"great\" - It's really good and quite the film making endeavor but doesn't quite have the charm the 1991 Animated film does due to the fact we've all seen and heard these songs/story before. Regardless, the numbers show that Disney won't stop the live action remakes anytime soon. So, look to Pixar for more original materials (sort of).",

I expected much more from Emma Watson, she usually does so much better... This movie is extremely unreal and looks very edited for such a high profile, high budget movie. If anyone hasn't seen the original 90's masterpiece, I would recommend that version over the new version ANYDAY. Emma Watson is an AMAZING actress, but they should've picked a different cast all together. For example, most all HUMAN characters in this film have English accents, yet they still use French words like, \"bonjour\", \"monsieur\", etc. Kind of hard to connect to the film when you break that dialogue/language barrier already in the first few minutes... They did stick very heavily to the storyline, with most all dialogue and narration matching almost identical to the original film, but the French vs English accent threw me off and some of the locations and set designs threw me off as well. OH! And not to mention the HORRID singing and TERRIBLE stunts/editing. Very disappointed, never expected to NOT fall in love with a disney film, especially a modern live action. I would've liked the movie a lot more if it would've stayed true to the settings and small details. My advice to disney? Stop trying to focus so much on singing and copying the EXACT script from the original film, and start focusing on scouting better locations, cast members, and designing better sets that are similar to our original idea of the \"little town full of little people\".",

As for Emma Watson, she was ideal for this role, Belle's character is of a strong and inspiring young girl who doesn't deal things by traditional society rules and always seeks for better change, so it is something Watson can relate with, that's why she played Belle so passionately.

I liked most of the character designs and costumes, but some CGIs can still be improved. To conclude, it's grander and more intricate, but the original movie is still funnier and more endearing.",

            "content": "Must Walt Disney Studios Redraw Its Future?\n\nDisney presides over the current film scene in terms of money and art. The company founded by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks benefits from film studios with higher profitability on the market, which are the owner of retributive franchises such as \"Star Wars,\" \"Indiana Jones\", Pixar Animation Studios' works and the complete universe of Marvel Comics. The money amount it earns periodically with each of its proposals is unheard-of, either original ideas, those that turn to imagination without employing creative precedents, or remakes, audiovisual productions reproduces the narrative thread, the atmosphere in which the story runs, characters, and even pre-existing songs, in this case, from unreproducible animated classics.For a person who loves and understands film substance, it's dishonorable and enervating to see how celluloid world isn't being handled by creative artists, but by financial managers and accountants presiding artificial productions at box-office designs' expense, shelving true meaning of cinema. An archetype of this is the hybrid that I mentioned earlier, etymologically known as live- action. Hollywood executive's greed is derisory, greediness brazenly covers up under the shadow of hypothetical homages or reinventions for the audiences of the 20th century, those who have not had the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the likable unalterable animated characters and stories. However, we cannot declare that live-action feature films presented are strictly a way to make money, this is the hidden purpose, the released guinea pigs have been reasonably great. So this is where the final questioning emerges: must we pass unnoticed Disney's money desires if and only if it remains to offer audiovisual productions entirely well made, even if they continue to nurture the plague producing creative shortcomings nowadays? Judge for yourselves. \n\nImaginative impasse's last prey is \"Beauty and the Beast\", Disney's first movie in being nominated in six different categories at the Academy Awards, of which won two awards with reference to its unforgettable OST.The reinterpretation of the story of a prince transfigured int beast because of his arrogant conceit and his corresponding love affair with a villager who arrives his castle to rescue her father, examining enormous expectation set up months ago, is a modern contraption artistically uneven, it fulfills the objective of evoking the amazing inspiration source, at the same time develops more complex stories and plausible motivations, but using an almost integral copy. Although there's a patent female empowerment message, an unjustified noise for the first homosexual character of the company and places as meticulous as magnificent, it looks as if narrative were in unripe, and I don't mean the tale itself, since we already know it fully, I say this for autonomy lack with the basic story.\n\nWilliam \"Bill\" Condon (\"Dreamgirls\" & \"Mr. Holmes\") does what he can with the tools on his property. We've had the pleasure of knowing Mr. Condon's aptitudes in sharply human films, the filmmaker exhibited his sensitive eye to portray fables with a dramatic base in these ones. The director will make to resurface briefly the charm of years ago with almost emulated camera shots, only altered by indescribable technological advances, however, the real magic keeps in the adorable animation from the 90s. The dance scene, 'Be Our Guest' musical number and the terminal moment will stimulate the awakening of memories supported by no ideal love and inner beauty, besides the rewarding minor variations to the soundtrack. Such immoderate fidelity allows it to touch both glory and failure at the same time. A recreation with less interest in the most circumstances, perhaps, it would have been better to get away from the original material a little more, just as Christophe Gans' dismal adaptation.\n\nIn respect of visual part, they had a laborious and delicate job, erect rightly Villeneuve, beast's gloomy palace or the tavern where LeFoe adulates Gaston with a song or make with extreme delicacy characters attire weren't easy. The filmmaking is objectively its specialty, keeping in mind narrative standards raised previously. Although Rococo style, CGI animations and clothing and make-up are fetching, that too dark effect prevailing in the third act is neither pleasant nor required. Fortunately, such chromatic attenuation doesn't discredit Belle's stunning yellow dress, the design of the sets and its animated characters or Emma Watson paying homage to \"Mary Poppins\" with her musical scene. Beautiful pictures.\n\nIf it had optimal challenges graphically, musically was impossible to get even an infinitesimal improvement, and effectively, impossible is impossible. Despite original composer (Alan Menken) returned to provide his services, none of his new scores are entirely predominant, however, the interpretation of the music classic in the voices of Ariana Grande and John Legend recalls melodic beauty from the original song.\n\nThe classic movie will remain a classic, but what would be a true modern classic falls short in charm. Exhausting run-time, Watson's overvaluation, the CGI technique in the face of the Beast of doubtful credibility, exaggerated darkness in the third act, and a few new forgettable songs complicate the goals of Disney about its winning streak. I've rated the film with reference to the original movie, since although they didn't want to alter or pass inspiration source, their attempt stays in a lax reinterpretation, as if Condon and his team wanted to draw frame by frame with beautiful elements which don't find who make them shine, and although in matter of adaptations, respectful similarity is what must prevail, it lacks magic. \"Beauty and the Beast\" (2017) is far from being a bad movie, nevertheless, they knew what and who they faced, and evidently failed to convince so big beasts.",

Given the exposure and hype for this remake, the expectation among many was that the film would fall flat or never get close to matching up to the original. All of those cynical and downcast thoughts were quickly dashed in a little over of two hours of wonderful and magical storytelling. A stellar cast, were perfectly cast, the CGI and sets helped to create realistic and dreamy settings, and the acting of everyone made sure that the film flowed as beautifully as Belle's iconic dress. \n\nThe impression I got throughout the film, was one of Disney's sense of wonder mixed with a Golden Age Hollywood glamour and artistry. There were many scenes, notably the \"Beauty and the Beast\" scene, where opulence and majesty were prevalent in everything, from Belle's dress (outstanding!) to the castle's decorations. The vibrancy of these scenes were breathtaking to watch and a feast for the eyes. Speaking of feasts, another song/scene that worked very well was \"Be Our Guest\". The CGI and singing worked extremely well with one another, and everything flowed exceptionally well. Ewan McGregor's singing was especially good in this scene, which came as no surprise given his role in Moulin Rouge all those years ago.\n\nEmma's Belle, and Dan's Beast had great chemistry with one another, and the burgeoning romance was presented in a realistic and believable manner which did justice to the audience that expected another masterpiece to live up to the Disney classics, which this is sure to become. The banter and verbal sparring was excellent, and this helped to create a rapport between them, and also to sow the seeds of the romance that was to build upon this.\n\nIt can not be helped but to get lost in this film. The storytelling was paced perfectly well, there wasn't a moment where I think anyone would be bored or looking at their watch/phone. The progression of the romance was a critical aspect that contributed to the storytelling success, and props go to Emma and Dan's acting ability and the evident rapport they have with one another, but also to the director, Bill Condon, who has taken on the enormous responsibility for the film, and he deserves the adulation that the film is sure to get.\n\nBeauty and the Beast is a wondrous and beautiful experience that everyone, young and old, would enjoy. The 'beauty on the inside' moral is something that needs to rear its head in the age of social media, where instant gratification through beauty and filters is seemingly important to a large portion of people. The exceptional casting, fantastic CGI and brilliant direction have all come together to create another Disney masterpiece, alongside the original, and will be watched by a new generation of people that will fall in love with Emma and Dan's Beauty and the Beast. This is a film that I have instantly fallen in love with, and I will be pre-ordering it on Blu-Ray ASAP!! \n\nhttps://rwh92.wordpress.com/",

The tendency for Disney with adaptations of their cartoon to film remakes is to add a Broadway feel that does not work as well as a true adaptation.\n\nThe Broadway play was exquisite and this felt like a filmed version of the musical. What made Broadway great was the inventiveness of how to tell the story for the stage. This lacked the brilliance the cartoon and stage performance stood apart for. Worth seeing though, but not owning.",

I like her very much as an actress, but this really wasn't her role. I watched it by myself first because I wanted to see if it was scary before I show it to my daughter. This movie was so horribly painful I don't think I'll even show it to her. Just ruins the memory of the original. I mean, really? They couldn't have put at least a little new different angle to it?

Plus, giving oral would not be pleasurable for a woman. Unless he licks like a dog, then that might be pleasurable. Not to mention an erection. What would that be like? Is like a bull penis or is it more like the dog lipstick?\n\nthen, SPOILER ALERT for those of you who don't know the ending of a 300 year old story, after the beast becomes a man (a man who probably looks better as a walking buffalo), the girl wants him to grow a beard. what next? bringing animals into the bedroom? also, my wife brought up that he had hooves and hind legs like a cow, so how does he get up and down the stairs? The actress, though attractive, didn't really have what i thought would be the Bella look. i know it's corny and probably not expected in this modern world, but perhaps someone like Ariana Grande would fit better in this roll (plus, she sings). also, where's all the gay $#!+ that everyone was talking about? i waited so long for it, with my Vaseline and Kleenex and saw nothing. did i miss something? sure, there was a guy who gets put in a dress and enjoys it, but as my social brainwashing goes, that does not make one gay. then the two dudes dancing together. unless they're rubbing up on each other, doing the bump and grind or grabbing each other's ass, then i don't think that's gay. but then again, you're watching a musical -- now, that's gay. also, the state of Alabama is said to have a problem with Disney having a gay character, and the worst of it is two dudes dance together, yet they have no problem with a woman getting it on with a buffalo.

            "content": "This movie was excellent and I find all the hate towards it absolutely absurd. First of all, if Stockholm Syndrome is a reason for you to hate it, A you should've hated the first one, B you have no clue what Stockholm Syndrome actually is. Do your own research on it. Emma Watson did before she actually signed onto this role. Secondly, ok the movie isn't perfect, there are some flaws. I'll admit to that. Like how Belle and the prince after he transformed back into a human just gave each other blank stares before they kissed, that was the only thing that really did disappoint me a whole lot. I wish they could've kept a dialogue. Also, Dan Stevens did look like a caveman when he became human again, but maybe they thought it's a little too unrealistic for live action if he did actually was a handsome prince after all that time as an ugly beast. I think the musical scores, although they weren't quite like the original, they were good enough for me to sing along to. Sure this wasn't perfect but don't act like the original was perfect either. There were things even for an animation didn't make sense in the original that this one did a good job at correcting. I think Emma Watson made Belle a lot more realistic and I give her 2 thumbs up for that. She was way more bold and her not being as cheerish is because she's bored in the small provential town and she's imprisoned. You can exaggerate with animation, but with live action, that would just look silly. Now Gaston, well I do think the directing was good with him, how they made his evilness sneak up on you more and he was more intimidating than the original Gaston, but I still like the original Gaston more because he had a lot more charisma. Luke Evans isn't such a good actor. This is the best he's ever done but that's not saying much and he had a great director and a great cast around him to help him as much as they could. I also think Lafou was more memorable. In the original, he was just a really weak wingman while here he was more like a best gay friend. I do think Ewan McGregor did the best he could as Lumier given that he's not French and he didn't see the original, but his struggles with the French accent were quite noticeable so I'll have to go with Jerry Orbach. I still enjoyed Ewan McGregor though because he is very charismatic. I also think the original Cogswarth was better and Ian McKeller just didn't seem too happy to get the role he wanted. Now the Beast, ok I agree that the CGI looked terrible, but Dan Stevens still played him really well. I felt more of a real connection between the Beast and Belle in the live action and I also was glad to know about Belle's mother's whereabouts. With the music, ok for the most part, the original wins. Especially the song Beauty & The Beast. Emma Thompson's singing isn't bad but no way she could do it better than Angela Lansbery. Everything else too, I think Angela Lansbery did better than Emma Thompson. I also liked that Kevin Kline was not crazy old Maurice and sure crazy old Maurice was entertaining, but also not the kind of father I'd really want. I also think when Belle and Maurice were locked up, that Belle actually got herself and her father out of there with her own strategy rather than get lucky and have Chip save them. Here, we can go both ways, the ending, how everyone watched Belle and the prince dance and live happily ever after, as heartwarming as that is, I think it was also great in the live action that the whole castle got to celebrate being human again. In fact, backtracking a bit, I also thought it was really cool how they showed the visuals of how the prince became a beast rather than images through narration. The prologue in this one is a clear winner in my book. But in the original's defense, it might be harder to make it look good with animation, but nonetheless, I enjoyed the visuals of that a lot more.",

Emma did not have the sweetness or whilst of cartoon Belle.

I created (with the help of a lot of friends) two cut glass crystal balls mounted on a wooden base with a tiny LED white light under it that made the two globes glow. In the darkened ballroom they were like two beacons of light. Now, twenty-five years later, my wife and I are getting divorced and Walt Disney has \"Beauty and the Beast\" live action out in theaters. I am alone. So I decided I wanted to see how this new version stacks up against the animated film. I came ill prepared. No tissues. By the time the movie had reached the ballroom scene I was crying silently as I did through the rest of the entire film. Yes. Some may say it isn't the best but I felt everyone in the film tried their best to present a wonderful film. Loved Kevin Kline, Emma Watson, Ewan McGregor, and everyone else. If only there was enough magic to bring my wife back from Arizona to Texas so we could be together again. But she wants to live where her parents are and I do not want to live over 8,000ft above sea level. But who knows. Stranger things have happened to me and maybe just a little of the magic the Disney company put in to the movie has rubbed off on me. I really loved this film. I thought the acting was decent (especially towards the end) and I might even wind up buying it when it comes out on DVD. (or maybe on something like Amazon Prime).

Everything about this was classic Disney and I was left wanting to know more about the non-human characters once they finally came to life late. Very solid movie.",

Directed by Bill Condon (who wrote the screenplay for 2002s Chicago and directed 2006s Dreamgirls-signifying he has a knack for musicals), the film has an AAA quality on the surface and ticks the right boxes for what a live-action Beauty and the Beast should feel (and sound)  like. Where the original allowed the viewer to suspend disbelief a tad more (as it was animation), Condon's use of CG to animate the beast takes time getting used to (especially when he sings) and the decision to more or less do a shot-for-shot remake of the original signifies how strong that first film was, but despite that this update to the material still serves as a nice compliment to the 1991 film and is a solid effort at bringing Beauty and the Beast into three dimensions.",

            "content": "I get the hate for this movie. Nothing exceeds the original and the original will be marked as an all time classic. If you compare both these movies side by side, this movie will suck, I promise you that. Despite that, this movie is still entertaining. Flawed? Yes. Outright awful? No. It has its flaws, nearly every movie does, but that doesn't take away from some of the good in this movie. If you haven't seen the original(I recommend you do) I imagine you'll enjoy this movie for the most part. If you have seen the original and are going to constantly compare this movie to that, then you won't enjoy this movie. Overall, I will say this movie is worth watching, and I imagine most audiences(especially children) will really enjoy this movie. Also, if you prevent your child/refuse to see this movie because of the alleged Le Foue gay controversy then you have nothing to worry about. They gloss over it is seconds and it won't bother you at all.\n\nThe story is a 'tale as old as time' but that doesn't make it any less magical, exciting and enjoyable. It's pretty much the story of the original with a few tweaks here and there so if you've seen the original, you'll know the story and won't be surprised(much) but if you haven't then you'll get to experience a wonderful story for the first time in live action. Either way, it's a good story. \n\nI will say that most of the casting in this movie is absolutely flawless. Emma Watson was fine as Belle but she isn't the best singer and when she is, it's clearly been heavily edited. They explore Belle's character more in this version which I will say was pretty nice and a welcome inclusion. Dan Stevens was great as the Beast but I do feel like he could have put more care into some of his scenes and not rushed things. There were many scenes that should have had greater meaning and effect but didn't, and that was down partly to Steven's portrayal but mostly down to Condon's direction. I also didn't like the arc of the Beast and though it was primarily just a straight line with no curves or edges. Luke Evans was just fantastic as Gaston and plays the part to perfection. He made the role his own and was easily one of the best parts of this movie. Gaston is also just a really great villain. He's awesome. You can't mention Gaston without his buddy Le Foue(played wonderfully by Josh Gad) who has had some tweaks to his character and arc(some of which stupidly garnered controversy) all of which I like and am happy Disney went with. Both Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen were great as Lumiere and Cogsworth respectively and both their characters stood out for me. Kevin Kline was also really good as Maurice and the relationship between him and Belle was explored more and was another welcome improvement. \n\nOn a technical standpoint, this movie is absolutely gorgeous and looks amazing. The visual effects were all awesome, even if I would have done the Beast a tad differently. Both the costume and set design were all really good and looked nice with the time period. The cinematography was also amazing.\n\nWhile this movie made some minor changes, it didn't add/remove/alter enough for me to say a sequel was needed or warranted. It was reasonably funny but some of the jokes were clearly aimed at the lowest possible denominator. It did need to reintroduce this classic tale to children of this age but some of the kids in my audience were crying and even I was pretty shocked by how graphic some scenes were(as far as making the audience scared goes) and scare factor of some scenes. The action was amazing though and it didn't even need to be that great.\n\nThey do carry over much of the music from the original(while adding new songs) but none of them are done as well as in the original and none of them were performed to a spectacular degree. \n\nIn conclusion, if you can ignore the existence of the original you will most likely enjoy this movie. The acting is great, the story is great, the visuals are gorgeous but it does lack some of the charm and sense of wonder that the original did posses. Despite this, I can say I recommend this movie as long as you can forget the existence of the 1991 Classic.\n\n7/10\n\nWould Recommend",

Brought my childhood favorite animated classic to life as well as could be imagined and presented in live action.\n\nEmma Watson was a fabulous and superb casting choice to play the role of Belle.  Another actress who comes to mind that might have played the role of Belle as well as Emma Watson is probably Keira Knightley (FYI, Keira Knightley has been cast to play the lead role in Disney's movie remake of the \"Nutcracker\" scheduled to be released next year November 2018).  Both actresses are talented & radiant, with fearless, strong-willed, independent personas combined with their sweet, charming, and natural European born speaking accents that fit well with the European style setting and background of this movie's storyline.  Emma Watson and the other cast members each gave solid acting and admirable singing performances all-around.  \n\nGreat accomplishment to all involved in the movie!  Congratulations to the film on becoming only the 8th movie in US Domestic box office history to gross $500+ million in it's theater run along with being an all-time Top 10 worldwide total box office gross of $1.26+ billion is quite the achievements.

Spot-on performances by the entire ensemble cast, with especially standout portrayals by Emma Watson as Belle & Luke Evans as Gaston.  Ewan McGregor as as Lumiere, Kevin Kline as Maurice, Emma Thompson as Ms. Potts, and Dan Stevens as the Prince/Beast also gave solid admirable efforts. \n\nEmma Watson gave an overall excellent standout performance as Belle, her singing was probably the \"weakest\" part of her portrayal.  She has a pleasant singing voice, just not the vocal range compared to the other character roles and cast members in movie.  The opening number when she was introduced as Belle sounded nice, but was a bit over-produced and \"auto-tuned\".  To be fair, all the cast members singing vocals in the movie were likely \"auto-tuned\" and processed to varying extents.  That is the nature of a movie studio production, especially in a musical driven version.  So to focus critiques only on Emma Watson's vocals as being \"auto-tuned\" in the opening scene introducing Belle's character seems objectively unfair.  I thought her later singing moments as Belle in the movie got noticeably better and sounded more natural as the film went along.  Her best singing scene was her last section, during the somber \"How Does A Moment Last Forever\" portion when the Beast/Prince brings Belle to Paris, France using his enchanted magical book to the small chateau where Belle's mother passed away from the plague when she was a baby.  She exuded an emotional natural singing voice to capture and portray that sad somber moment very well during that scene of the movie.  Emma Watson's sincere acting, charming persona, radiant appearance, and admirable vocals for a 1st time singer in a movie musical combined to superbly embrace and embody her role as Belle with graceful style.   \n\nOverall, fabulous and enchanting performances by the ensemble cast.  Great work on the production, costumes, direction, and CGI special effects by everyone involved in the movie.  Well done!",

Honestly, I don't remember much about it except Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts and a vague sense that I enjoyed the film and music at the time. Disney's new live-action version of Beauty and the Beast (2017) is certainly a worthy successor on many levels. It features a strong cast (for the most part). Emma Watson is the perfect Belle. Her voice is surprisingly pleasant though this film hardly tests her range as a singer. Ewan McGregor as Lumiere is the standout supporting actor and Emma Thompson (sporting a heavy Cockney accent, for some reason) is a worthy successor to Lansbury's Mrs. Potts. Luke Evans and (especially) Josh Gad are also good as Gaston and Le Fou. The only minor weakness in the cast is Dan Stevens as the Beast/Prince. He is adequate, no more; hardly memorable in the role. Everyone including Disney knows this musical's 'money songs', e.g. Be Our Guest and the title track. Disney certainly delivers the goods for those songs, especially \"Be Our Guest\", which is the undeniable highlight of the film. It is very easy to understand why this new version of Beauty and the Beast is the highest grossing PG film in US history (NOT most ticketed; Gone with the Wind and Star Wars are still #1 and #2 in that regard).

The casting was 1st rate overall.  Starting with Emma Watson, who portrayed Belle with modern enlightenment, radiance, independence, intelligence, strong-will, and fearless strength.  While at the same time, instilling a sense of charm and touch of sweetness that gives the main character Belle a completeness and realism that forms the core of the movie.  She embodied and naturally grew into the role of Belle as the movie developed and brought her animated character to life as well as could be imagined and portrayed in this live action remake.   Other solid performances by the cast include Dan Stevens as the Beast/Prince. Luke Evans as Gaston, Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, Kevin Kline as Maurice, and Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts.  The overall casting selections was the primary strength of this Disney movie musical remake.\n\nAs far as the comments about auto-tuning vocals, this movie musical likely had it's fair share of vocal optimization and audio processing of the singing scenes during production release.  Every musical production and studio recording album goes through that process.  Why is that?  Because even the best singers and musical artists generally sound better on their released studio recording albums compared to live event concert singing, so it is the nature of the process.  I think Emma Watson and the rest of the cast each gave admirable vocal performances during their singing moments.  Other than Luke Evans and Ewan McGregor, I don't think any of the other major actors and actresses portraying the other main characters roles had previous Broadway stage theater play experience.  If this was casting for the Broadway musical version, then better singers and stage performers would have clearly been cast.  But given this was casting for a movie/musical movie live-action remake, the combination acting talents and singing abilities of the actors and actresses were well-chosen and more than fit the bill to present this top-notch movie/musical production that will be remembered for generations to come.\n\nThis live action remake version of \"Beauty & The Beast\" has become an all-time Top 10 movie at the US domestic ($500+ million) and international worldwide ($1.26+ billion) in box office revenues.  As both an overall success with critics and astonishing box office performance with audiences worldwide, the results and reactions speak for itself.  Well done, great work, and amazing accomplishment by Walt Disney studios, director Bill Condon, and by the great acting ensemble cast.  Looking forward to more live action remakes.

In a breath of fresh air, the movie is almost a play-by-play of the original film. These days it is expected that a classic fairytale will be mangled by a studio in an attempt to deliver a 'fresh perspective' to their audience. I have to admit that I expected the same from this version, but was pleasantly surprised by the result. I am not a fan of the Beauty and the Beast storyline, but I can appreciate a film well made.\n\nWe are introduced to Belle, a beautiful french girl who lives with her father Maurice (Kevin Kline) in provincial France (albeit speaking in a British accent). She finds the village boring and small-minded and in turn, the villagers think she is aloof and strange (she enjoys reading - which is only reserved for those not intent on marrying and producing babies). She is persistently pursued by the handsome (read: narcissistic) Gaston (Luke Evans), egged on by his sidekick Lefou(Josh Gad). And yes, they are both annoying as hell.\n\nFollowing an unfortunate series of events, Belle finds herself the prisoner of a Beast(previously a mean Prince but cursed until he can learn to be a good boy) in an enchanted castle. Everyone knows the plotline to the story so I won't be giving away any spoilers here. The spellbound furniture is convinced that Belle would be the girl to break the spell cast on the Beast. Only true love would free them from the curse, but their time is running out. They plot to bring the two together - cue eye roll. (Call me cold-hearted, but talking furniture hasn't made me smile since I was 5). Within a few days, Belle has acclimatised to her new life in the castle and the Beast has made nice. He gives her his entire library, which makes her giggle and smile, so we know that she is starting to get comfy. The food is great, she can read to her heart's content. Besides uncapped wi-fi, what more could a girl want? In no time, Belle breaks out in song about how sweet and gentle the Beast is under all that fur.\n\nSkipping ahead we see Belle's father, Maurice, trying to rally the town to help him free Belle. People think Maurice is mad and eventually, Gaston, using the scenario to his advantage, reveals his true colours (surprise, surprise) and ties Maurice to a tree as fodder for the wolves. Belle sees this in a magic mirror and the Beast lets her leave to help him. When Belle arrives in the village, Gaston quickly realises that she has feelings for the Beast and they lock Belle up and head out to kill the Beast. The villagers, spurred by Gaston's jealous rage.\n\nIn an icy rooftop battle, Gaston and the Beast fight it out. We all know the Beast wins the day and Gaston meets his icy death (it would have been more satisfying if the villagers had turned against Gaston and sent him to the madhouse instead). The Beast breathes his final breath and Belle proclaims her love for him. The spell is lifted and everyone rejoices as the castle is bathed in sunlight once again. In true fairytale style, the movie ends with singing and dancing and true love prevailing over all.\n\nThe costumes are lovely and the special effects believable. (I almost prefer Dan Stevens WITH the fur.) There were some laughs, a lot of singing and plenty of eye-roll moments.\n\nAside from a few personal gripes, the question remains: Did I enjoy it? Yes.\n\nShould you watch it? Why not!",

The casting, acting performances, along with the CGI special effects, and fabulous direction of Bill Condon together combined to make this movie a magnificent success. \n\nFor all the comments about auto-tuning the vocals of Emma Watson, it likely did happen.  But they likely also did some level of auto-tuning for the other cast members vocals as well.  But it honestly did not bother me.  Some level of vocal enhancement, audio processing, and fine auto-tuning of recorded singing likely happens for movie musicals and audio recording studios for various performers.  Not just for actors/actresses in movie musicals, but for studio music albums released for even the best musical artists.  So some level of vocal sound production was likely done for the singing moments during this movie musical for the cast members to varying extents.  Each member of the cast performed their vocal singing sections admirably, with Luke Evans as Gaston and Ewan McGregor as Lumeire particularly standing out in their singing sections given their previous Broadway musical theater backgrounds.  \n\nIn the end, this live action version of \"Beauty & The Beast\" will finish as one of the Top 10 grossing movies all-time revenue grosses earned at the box office.  Both domestically and internationally worldwide overall.  So based on those box office results, a vast majority people who saw this movie enjoyed, were entertained, and pleased with what they saw in the theaters.

But after letting the credits roll on Beauty and the Beast, the disappointment that came with it wasn't really that much of a surprise. \n\nOverall the movie itself had it's charming points and it may have worked better if I hadn't been constantly comparing it to the 1991 animated classic because of how little new work was done on the remake. Whilst this usually wouldn't be a problem, as it's nice seeing a remake being faithful to the original piece, the most important scenes in the movie we're not done well. Whilst in the originals scenes such as the ballroom dance, Beasts 'death' and Belle finally saying 'i love you' had me giggling like a 10 year old, in this movie they felt void of emotions and I was especially sad to see that Belle wasn't wearing her iconic dress. \n\nI'll admit, I sang along to the catchy tune that was 'Gaston' but cringed at  the obvious and blant auto-tune that was Emma Watson's singing and the little effort that was put into making it look like the audio track wasn't just simply put over her good-ish at most acting. Her failure to portray many aspects of Belle made me really wish another, more suited, actress was chosen for the role. Emma Watson has had some great movies in the past excluding Harry Potter, but this role is one that she certainly did not fit into, both in way of acting and deliverance of necessary emotions. \n\nVisually, the movie wasn't breath taking but it was pretty and added to the whole setting that is a 'fairy tail'. Some parts, especially the Beast could have been worked upon. BUT over all, the movie wasn't good but neither was it terrible. It had it's charming bits and it was interesting to see how our beloved animated characters were brought to life on screen, however this could never live up to the original and I would love to see one day another group of talented actors and screen writers once again breathe life into a timeless classic.",

Aside from a few additions and revisions, it pretty much is the exact same film down to the script and the songs.  Therein lies the problem.  I know this remake was extremely popular worldwide, but I had a hard time not comparing it to the original.  I was ok with the added scenes/songs like fleshing out Belle's father, but part of me was a bit impatient, feeling like it was unnecessary and slowed the pacing of the film. \nI adore Emma Watson, but I was torn by her portrayal of Belle.  She was able to pull off the charm and sweetness of the animated version, but she clearly did not have the vocal chops.  Unlike everyone else, her voice was so autotuned, it pulled me out of the viewing experience.  Anyway, It seems like most people were fine with it.\nGiven a choice, I'd easily pick the animated film over this, but it's extremely faithful adaptation means a majority of fans should greatly enjoy it.",

Having the villain be relatable enough to understand his motives yet rightfully fail in the end and having the hero have more of a darker side rather than be perfect would've been sweet.

            "content": "Two questions came to mind as I left the popcorn-strewn theater. The first is somewhat existential: what's the point? The second is more practical: how can a \"live-action\" remake of a cartoon be more fake, reproduced, and counterfeit than the original animated feature?\n\nThe first question is not directed at remakes in general. There have been masterful remakes of classic movies that present a new perspective on the original: True Grit (2010), Nosferatu (1979), and others. To remake a movie is to assume that the movie needs to be remade--that there is a story untold by the original or that there is a more effective way to tell the original story. Otherwise, what's the point? If the only reason to remake a movie is to \"bring it into the 21st century,\" that remake is most likely doomed to disaster. Indeed, if the driving motivation for remaking a film, not to mention a classic, well-beloved, Oscar-winning film, is either money or \"wouldn't that be cool in CG,\" it stands to reason that the film most likely shouldn't be made. Comparisons are inevitable between films, so my guiding principle is that remakes should only be made if there is a riveting new perspective with which to view the original source material.\n\nUnfortunately, Disney's remake of Beauty and the Beast is a stale, campy knock-off of the original 1991 film.\n\nBeauty and the Beast (2017) follows the same structure as the original and a majority of the shots are identical. Part of the success of the original animated film is its tight edit. In order to fit within the typical 90 minute time frame, every second of on-screen storytelling must work. The 2017 remake makes additions, but these additions simply bloat the run time without doing much work. This problem in itself makes watching the remake seem sluggish.\n\nIt's when we get to the particulars, however, that the remake's flaws stand in greater relief.\n\nWho Wrote This Thing?\n\nSome of the original's snappy, well-written dialogue remains in the remake, but so much of the additional dialogue is pedantic and redundant. So often, characters onscreen narrate their actions. All characters suffer from this, and most are written as if they have to remind themselves of their stage directions. For instance, it is established in the film that Belle is given a rose every year for her birthday, and Maurice promises to bring back a rose from the market. Instead of trusting the audience to remember Maurice's promise made 20 minutes earlier, Maurice talks to himself through his action of cutting a rose: \"Oh I almost forgot, I will cut a rose to bring back to Belle.\" Sure enough, he cuts the rose to bring back to Belle.\n\nAdditionally, many of the original iconic and important lines of dialogue or situations are altered. The Beast no longer is given the character development of planning a gift of his library; instead, he gives the library to Belle with an apathetic shrug. Why change this moment? It serves no purpose and instead cheapens the Beast's already quick character development.\n\nIndeed, it is the Beast's character which is the most disappointingly lacking. The original's beast is dangerous, bestial, and in some scenes quite scary. His screen presence is fraught with potential danger, and his looming, permanent dehumanization makes him even more primal. When Belle enters the west wing in the 1991 original, the Beast reacts as a territorial animal, and screams \"Do you realize what you could have done? Get out!\"  In the remake, the Beast's lines are padded: \"Do you realize what you could have done? You could have damned us all! Get out of here! GO!\" This wordiness and the performance by Dan Stevens is weak compared to the original, and instead of Belle (or the audience) fearing for Belle's life, we instead feel annoyance at the Beast's rudeness.\n\nPerhaps the most egregious damage to the Beast's character comes when Belle leaves to find her father. In the original, the Beast roars in a howl of pain and loss that is haunting and unnerving. In the remake? The Beast is given a sappy  singing number. The first few lines juxtapose the original well:\n\nI was the one who had it all\nI was the master of my fate\nI never needed anybody in my life\nI learned the truth too late\n\nI'll never shake away the pain\nI close my eyes but she's still there\nI let her steal into my melancholy heart\nIt's more than I can bear . . .\n\nSo the question is raised: who is the Beast? Is he simply an emotionally charged, spoiled Prince in a fur suit? Or is he a beast? The beast loses his danger, isolation, and dehumanized plight; instead, he is characterized by sappy, teenage angst. Gag me with an enchanted spoon.\n\nWhat Could Have Been\n\nSo what could the remake have been? The seeds for an interesting and powerful remake are within the 2017 film. In contrast to the 1991 original, the transformed servants become more and more inhuman as the enchanted rose loses its petals. While it would make sense for this to be true of the Beast, we never see any indication that he loses his humanity as the petals fall.\n\nHe should.\n\nThis simple device could have transformed (no pun intended) the watery remake into a much more thrilling and gripping film.\n\nIf the Beast had suffered from the same plight as the servants, he would truly be a character struggling to fight his increasing animal instincts in an effort to remain human. In a beautiful twist on the original, the Beast's growing love and sacrifice for Belle would have not only been a change from his previous, entitled self but also a true expression of love (self-sacrifice) in the face of impending damnation as an inhuman animal.\n\nBelle's character would have likewise been more developed. She would be demonstrating true love herself--showing courage in the face of real danger (the Beast would be, after all, more animal than human), showing compassion for an man who is slowly losing his humanity, and actually falling in love with the person he is striving to be, even as every circumstance is fighting against his newfound humanity.\n\nStripping away all the musical performances (which let's face it, there are no songs on the 2017 remake which top the 1991 original, so why even invite such a comparison?), the film would be free from constraint and able to tell a truly new perspective on the original. Would this re-imagined film be child friendly? Most likely not: the Beast would be terrifying and the film would be much darker.\n\nPerhaps Disney would not have made the incredible profits they did by releasing a watered down, nostalgic version of the beloved 1991 film. Perhaps Disney would not have been able to sell as much merchandise as they are currently profiting from. But Disney's gains would have far exceeded their loss: they would have proved that they are committed to pursuing fine storytelling and film-making, hearkening back to their \"golden years\" of animation; they would have given legitimacy to their rather obvious cash-grab in remaking their own classics; they would have at least made an enjoyable film to watch.\n\nFor more movie reviews, check out my website: themoviesnobblog.com",

Cinderella, The Jungle Book, and Pete's Dragon have all had their own form of success one way or another, and now it was time for Beauty and the Beast to shine. The original animated film is a near-perfect masterpiece, so I was curious to see how they would approach the remake. In the end, Disney nails this movie out of the park. The set designs, the musical numbers, and the performances all shine in this gorgeous adaptation. Dan Stevens gives a phenomenal performance as the Beast, and I loved Luke Evans as Gaston as well. I was worried about Emma Watson's performance during her first few scenes, but she ended up finishing very strong, and she was lovely throughout the film. I enjoyed the few new songs that they added into the mix, and they nailed the original songs as well. One of my favorite aspects of the film is the set designs and costumes; though, and I can definitely see this movie getting an Oscar nomination in those two categories. Disney continues to impress with their live action remakes, and Beauty and the Beast is one of the most beautiful films you'll see all year.",

            "content": "When a movie is completely based on an older movie, especially a great one, a comparison must be made when reviewing it.\n\nPositive\n+ Emma Watson is great.\n+ The voice of the beast was very good. (Reminded me a bit of Worf from Star Trek or a Kilrathi from the Wing Commander games).\n+ CGI was very good.\n+ The new songs that were not in the first movie are ok.\n\nNegative\n- The songs of the first movie are not as good in this live action version. In this type of movie you come preparing to hear the familiar songs that you love from the first movie, but then you find out that they changed the flow of all the songs (which made the original songs great) as well as some of the iconic lines from the songs for no good reason (like the lines by LeFou at the end of the Gaston song).\n- Camera movement is very fast. When we are introduced to Belle's room in the castle the camera moves too fast and we can't see anything to feel in awe that was intended. When we see characters the camera don't stay on their faces long enough for us to familiar ourselves with their facial features to be able to relate to them and like them. We can barely make out Lumiere's face as he is moving all the time on the screen and there is hardly any close-up on his face. Also the dresser has no pupils in her eyes. This makes it really hard to relate to any of the characters and in a movie that is based on these characters it's a major problem.\n- The \"Be Our Guest\" song/scene is one of the most memorable from the first movie as it was unexpected at the time due to it's choreography and grandeur. In this movie it's was underwhelming as it was hard to see what was going on on the screen and it suffered from the same camera movement and flow of the song issues.\n- The relationship between Belle and the Beast is not developed enough, although this is true in the original movie as well.\n- The introduction of a new character, the Enchantress was not needed at all.\n- The ending of the movie was changed as well from loosing to winning by the magic of the Enchantress. This was made just to show how it would look if all the characters became permanently their object form. This took away from the good ending of the first movie and the suspense of the time limit by the falling rose petal. This made the entire concept of the falling rose petal meaningless!\n- Gaston's death is changed not to include his struggle with the beast. This should have been the climax of the movie, but failed.\n- Belle's mother explained, throwing interesting theories about her origin outside the window. Is her origin canon now?\n- Pushing liberal agendas such as homosexuality and interracial relationship into the movie where they don't belong. Although I 100% support these agendas in life, I'm not keen of them being pushed on the viewer in a movie that is based on a previous work.\n- The prince retained his \"grrrr\" beasty voice for a laugh (which wasn't funny). This is inconsistent with the transformation he already took reverting to the prince.\n- Not funny. Bits that were intended to be funny were not funny at all and were just embarrassing.\n\nOverall an ok movie that is not as good as the first one and does not contribute anything worthwhile over the first one, raising the question why it was made in the first place. There are also too many problems with it. A disappointment.\n\n3 Stars",

With me, it was mostly a good experience.\n\nOne of my favorite things about it were the addition of romantic moments between the two stars of the film. The original seriously lacked in these, and while it is a fairy tale and I can suspend some disbelief, I recall them falling in love in about a day without much work. At least in this film, they shared more scenes together, and had time with one another. I could actually believe that they had chemistry in this.\n\nI was delighted to see when viewing this that they kept it as a musical.

On one hand, it does not feature enough new scenes or subplots to differentiate itself from the classic 1991 feature; yet on the other hand, all of the ACTUAL new content is unjustified and proves to be ultimately superfluous to the main story and its themes. A couple of the sequences are thrilling to watch (notably Gaston's song and \"Be Our Guest\"), but most of the music cannot hold a candle (sorry for the pun) to the original film's songs. Heck, why didn't they just let Emma Watson sing normally without having to distort her voice so badly with the dubbing?! Even though the CGI is supposed to make everything look better, the talking anthropomorphize objects turn out to be a little too creepy in their artificiality. The only thing I can recommend seeing this flick for is the fantastic, lavish production design (that will probably take the Oscar next year). If you want to watch a rousing live-action musical, either stick with the unimpeachable animated movie or throw on 2012's \"Les Miserables\" instead.",

Beauty and the beast is all about music... It's not one number.. .There are a few songs where Belle is the star. Choosing someone who was mediocre and not professionally trained was a poor decision. Most of the great emotional moments from Watson did not feel believable... While out of the age demographic I wish they could have found someone like Ellie Kemper.. Her excitement is genuine. She has Belle's eyes of wonder. I feel Emma was show horned in because of the demographic that would be drawn to the movie. \n             There were many other subplots and musical numbers shoved into the piece and if they had done a spectacular job I would give it a nod...

It does have its feel of different story rather than expecting it to be the same as the 1991 version and I like that.

It has one of the strongest messages that Disney has thrown at us since day one, and that is to look at someone for who they are, not what they look like. Unfortunately, I can relate to this. But that's the beauty of it: this film can apply to more than enough people to believe that they have a shot of finding the right person who loves them for who they are. Along with that, the casting choices are impeccable. To me, Luke Evans' portrayal of Gaston stole the show, as he could go from a very serious role as Bard the Bowman in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit films to a role that lets him be as foolish and self-obsessed as he wants without being judged since it is a character trait in the film. Emma Watson's Belle hits home with a voice so beautiful it will transform the face of Disney live action reboots and musicals. Although I didn't see her coming as Belle, Emma Watson clearly demonstrates that she can take any role and form it as a piece of her heart.

I also appreciated the addition of Belle's backstory - that is, her mother's death - which was (justifiably) missing from the 1991 cartoon.\n\nOverall, this was a moving experience for me.

While the set and costume design were wonders and certainly deserve immense praise on their own, they unfortunately were not enough to cover for nothing more than a decent retelling of one of Disney's greatest. The film is a nearly beat-by-beat repeat of the 1991 film--which is not by any means a bad thing--but makes the interesting choice of adding about 10 minutes of additional backstory for Belle and a quick mention of a minor plot point to make Beast a more sympathetic character. While there is nothing inherently wrong with this, it really contributed nothing to the story overall. I personally found it strange that they chose to add more to the two main characters who already had a good amount of depth rather than choosing to give more insight into Gaston's character--an extremely two-dimensional character who regrettably remains so in this movie. There were a few more minor changes to the film, which overall helped to make it a bit more diverse as well as believable. \nI fully believe that the actors did a fantastic job at singing, however the songs are so autotuned it's difficult to really appreciate them at all. Additionally, while the side characters lack the charm of their animated counterparts, the main duo make up for it with their excellent chemistry. The two leads work well together to produce a convincing romance, even if it's not quite as magical as the original. All in all, an undeniably good movie, though one that does not nearly come close to challenging its predecessor.",

            "content": "Beauty and the Beast is not the first attempt at a major Disney live-action remake.  You'd never know that listening to the hype surrounding this damn movie.  Probably because the previous entries were not quite the four quadrant hits Disney was hoping for.  Alice in Wonderland was good if you were intoxicated and watching it on IMAX (which I was at the time), but ultimately mediocre and its sequel was so shit nobody bothered to see it.  Maleficent was something short of a disaster, but saved by Angelina Jolie's exceptional cosplay.  Cinderella was good for ya know...that crowd.  Jungle Book was a thuddingly average movie and I still have no goddamn clue how it won the Academy Award for best visual effects.  Beauty and the Beast seems to have reversed this problem, as critics and audiences like it and it seems to be doing well worldwide.\n\nWhy am I not wowed?  I will confess that I am perhaps not the target audience, but I like all kinds of family and/or animated movies.  And Beauty is well made and genial movie.  So why do I not give a crap about it a week after seeing it?  The devil is in the details and I assume so is the beast.  Beauty and the Beast more-or-less follows the 1991 animated classic, filling in unnecessary backstory, and gives some slight redesigns to its characters.  If Disney has learned any harsh lessons from its previous attempts at live-action remakes (or their franchise building in general recently) it's to avoid any real risks and play it safe as possible.  And I have to admit, sadly enough, it works.  Emma Watson's casting is the kind of \"face on the poster\" advertising that most studios would kill for and it makes some logical sense when taking into consideration how Belle is often regarded as the sophisticated and intellectual Disney princess.  Never mind those lovely cheekbones.  Watson's performance looks effortless, but I can't be the only one who thinks something's missing here in regards to her take on Disney's favorite bibliophile.  Dan Stevens does an admirable job as the titular Beast, but is let down by pretty dodgy CGI.  Luke Evans steals the show as a roguish and less-cartoonish Gaston and he has a quite a great buddy cop act going on with Josh Gad's LeFou, though the movie strains considerably to make the later more sympathetic as we get closer to the end.  And yes, the whole controversy regarding the sexuality of LeFou was the realm of a handful of dipshit conservative and family commentators met with PLENTY of liberal reactions clogging up your news feed on Facebook.  (God, I fucking hate 2017.)  The movie's visuals are decent and I thoroughly enjoyed the eighteenth century French aesthetic.  The musical numbers are as catchy as you remember them, with the show-stopper Be Our Guest serving as the highlight of the picture.  The redesigns of the castle's appliance and furniture characters were neat and I have to admit it was a real treat to watch them in action.  \n\nSo yes, Beauty and the Beast is a competent and likeable movie that few people will actively hate.  And I imagine if you are a family-oriented person who sees like...5 movies a year tops and avoids anything with violence or filthy sex that offends God or something, I'm sure this will be the best film you will see all year.  That, in of itself tells you what kind of person I am, but the harshest criticism I can make of Beauty and the Beast is that for all its production value, it lacks any soul or raison d'être.  It just...is.  If you are the kind of person that needed to see the movie you probably already have twice by now.  For the rest of us, you can wait until the last petal falls.",

Every exciting song, photography, costumes, visually amazing, 3D works very well. The dance scene made me so excited, my favorite scene was to see it and remember the animation. An incredible movie, adapted perfectly, made me laugh, cry and enjoy a lot. I totally recommend it.",

            "content": "This movie falls into the same issue ad Disney's others live-action remake; focussing on the wrong subject. \n\nBeauty and the Beast is not about Belle, she is only a medium through which the story is shown. The story is really about Beast. He's the one with heartache, a tragic upbringing which haunts him to this day, and ultimately changes in the end. \n\nThis new one focusses on Belle and to justify this they pad out time with an awkward subplot about Belle resentig her father for not talking about her mother. \n\nThis would be fine if it contributed to the plot but, it doesn't. If they removed thise scenes, nothing would be lost. \n\nThe screenplay was thin to begin with. It was heavily reliant on talented actors/ actresses to pull it off.  It didn'5 fet that. \n\nEmma Watson is the next biggest flaw with this film. She can't act. The entire film, she has the same disinterested look on her face and seems to be actively putting as little effort into this project as she can. Had she been a cameo, it would go unnoticed, but, she's the star. \n\nThe guy who played the father was also pretty lousy but he's hardly there. \n\nThey destroyed the Beast's character. He once had the best subtextual lines in Disney films but his dialogue in this remake is so on the nose it's cringeworthy. \n\nFor example; he's holding Gaston over the ledge. Gaston begs for mercy. In the original, Beast spares him and demands him to sinply \"get out.\" In the remake, Beast tells him \"i'm no beast.\", throws him to safety, and leaves. \n\nIn the original, when Belle leaves to save her father, Beast roars in pain. This renake, he sings about how sad he is. \n\nThis kind of on the nose dialogue deflates any tragidy with the Beast. \n\nI could go on for days why this remake is trash and deserves no praise, but,  this comment is long enough. \n\nPS: the set design is nauseating. Lay off the swirls, Disney.",
