    "summary": "After their flat becomes damaged, Emad (Shahab Hosseini) and Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti), a young couple living in Tehran, Iran, must move into another apartment. Once relocated, a sudden eruption of violence linked to the previous tenant of their new home dramatically changes their lives, creating a simmering tension between husband and wife.",

            "content": "Over the last fifteen years, Iranian director Asghar Farhadi has proven to be a filmmaker to be reckoned with.  Consistent with his emphasis on moral dilemmas stemming from societal issues, The Salesman is the story of a young couple from Tehran forced to leave their condemned apartment, eventually finding a home in the recently vacated unit of a ‘promiscuous' woman.  A violent incident involving the wife eventually leads the couple down a dangerous road of misguided retribution and accountability.  Farhadi's script is lean and insightful, providing an interesting story and well-developed characters.  The only fault with the film, without giving too much away, is why the elderly man visits the apartment in place of his future son-in-law knowing of its history.  Despite this, and while it may not resonate with the same power as A Separation from a few years earlier (but what does?), it remains a quietly suspenseful drama that's well worth a watch.",

The cast and plot makes you invested in the movie (a little in the beginning and in the middle and highly in the end), and in the end when you reach your maximum caring for the characters suddenly everything is torn down, and leaves you shocked when the movie ends. There are also some other unsettling scenes in the movie (such as the beginning when it is revealed the whole shaking of the building was because of constructions). This movie contains some small flaws as well, such as being a little slow paced in the begging and in the middle, and Emad randomly finding the truck in the street. In total, I think it deserves 5 stars.",

            "content": "Rather harrowing in its portrayal of how sexual assault can affect a marriage (both the victim and her husband and their relationship).  But also rather strange in its fusing of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman to its plot -- as both a thematic parallel (in which a man responds to an apparent threat to his masculinity) and a surprisingly literal denouement (which I'll leave unexplained so as not to spoil things).  You see the couple are actors who actually star in a community production of the play and a meeting with the local censors is the event that keeps the husband away late at the time his wife is attacked.  Then begins a search for the attacker and director Asghar Farhadi lets this unfold as any mystery might; they find his keys and his abandoned pick-up and try to piece things together without the aid of the police, who probably can't be trusted. At the same time, we see how the trauma is impacting the couple, separately and together, and their psychological reactions and subsequent actions; Shahab Hosseini and Taraneh Alidoosti manage to convey some very nuanced and ambivalent feelings in their very strong performances.  Farhadi is a master at playing on the ambiguities in situations; it is hard to know who is right and who is wrong and what the best course of action should be - and this is before he throws in a plot twist or two. He won the Oscar for best foreign film for A Separation, 2011, and then again for this film.  His films show us Iranian society and its unique culture and constraints but it also shows us how people living there have the same feelings, needs, and moral choices as anywhere else.  All of Farhadi's films are great but if I had to rank them, I would probably place About Elly (2009), A Separation (2011) and perhaps Fireworks Wednesday (2006) a bit higher than this one, which feels a little more forced and grimmer than usual.  But that is merely a quibble when all of his output is strides ahead of most challengers.",

Making parallels with the Arthur Miller play 'Death Of A Salesman' which I am admittedly not a big fan of since I was forced to read it in school, the story follows a couple in the aftermath of an attack in their home, which leaves scars deeper than they could have ever imagined. It's a family drama, a mystery, a thriller, a revenge flick, so many things rolled into one. The 2 leads are highly acclaimed in Iran and deservedly so, for they instil their characters with believability and gravitas, and the directorial decision to focus largely on their facial expressions allow us to witness every emotion they are going through in the most intimate of senses. The pacing is a little sluggish, and the final confrontation, while wrapping things up very nicely, does go on a bit long, and could do with a trim, but the film is otherwise solid. An engrossing, gripping analysis of when your home, your sanctuary, is no longer as safe as you'd hoped, and you're forced to deal with the horrifying consequences.",

            "content": "An interesting alternative title might have been \"Shame.\"\n\nThis won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 2017. Its director and script writer Asghar Farhadi is celebrated throughout the world as a great talent. I can see why. He's original and he gets great performances from his actors. Nonetheless I had to force myself to stay with this. It was so depressing in a most annoying way. The fear and the nearly all-consuming self-loathing that Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti) experiences after being assaulted in her own bathroom is in part culturally based, as is the plot of her husband Emad (Shahab Hosseini) for a secretive revenge.\n\nBEWARE SPOILERS\n\nRana's fear is real because she doesn't know who assaulted her, and part of her shame is understandable since she carelessly opened her door of their apartment without knowing for sure who was coming up. But a significant part of her shame is because the more conservative interpretations of Islam (and other tribal religions as well, by the way) blame the woman if she is raped. This complexity of emotions is part of what no doubt fascinated many viewers.\n\nBut I stayed with the movie, or actually I returned to it the next day. I was surprised at the resolution; I was surprised at Emad's sense of guilt. Yes, a man should be there to protect his wife, and perhaps if had been quicker at the market nothing would have happened. And perhaps there is guilt because he didn't investigate the circumstances of the apartment rental more thoroughly. (Apparently the previous tenant was a prostitute.) So in a sense they moved into a house of prostitution, as it were. And it is not beside the point to realize that Emad is playing Willie Lohman in a small theatre production of Arthur Miller's acclaimed play, \"The Death of a Salesman,\" a character who is ashamed because he sees himself as a failure.\n\nAgain we can see the complexities that Farhadi insists upon.\n\nOkay here are my problems with the movie. First though I should say that viewers who are not Iranian and not Muslim including myself may very well miss some of the subtleties and preconceptions of the action.\n\n1. Why the ambiguity about the rape? Or maybe it was clear and I wasn't able to discern that.\n\n2. Why is the guilty party a character who almost certainly could not commit the rape? (He could barely get up the stairs.)\n\n3. We know why Emad and Rana don't go to the police. (Only shame will result possibly without ever catching the perp.) However Emad's revenge plan of humiliating the assailant seems elaborate and slow to action. After all Emad has overwhelming evidence as to who did it. He just has to find him.\n\n4. The culprit's truck just sits there and then they move it. Is would seem that best strategy would be to report the truck as being parked illegally (do that yourself if necessary since you have the keys), call the police and see who shows up.\n\nBut again I don't live in Tehran so I really don't know what would have been the best way to proceed. What I do know is that Farhadi might have guided the general viewer less opaquely.\n\nBottom line: definitely worth seeing, but I suspect Farhadi's \"A Separation\" (2011) which I haven't seen is a better film.\n\n  --Dennis Littrell, author of the movie review book, \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote\"",

It is a French-Iranian co-production, but selected and won the Academy Awards for Iran. From the well know filmmaker of that region whose film had already won the same award in the not so past. I'm not just addicted to Hollywood. I'm a film fanatic because I give equal preference to films of the whole world. So I have seen as many as this year's submission for the Oscars in the category of the Foreign Language Films. And there are lots better films than this, that even did not make into the final five.

The mess is all because of Trump effect, as same reason 'Moonlight' to win the main trophy.\n\nAt least it was not an average film like 'A Separation', though not a masterpiece like 'The Past' that did not even nominated for the Oscars. It stands between them. The title name is not exactly relevant to the story. But it helped to extend the plot for an extra 20-30 minutes. An unnecessary subplot, which really were the boring parts. Or you can say, just to attract the western audience with their ingredient and that worked out as planned for the filmmakers. Except those theatre portions, the rest of the film and its storyline looked like I was watching a French thriller.\n\nIt is about a young couple who are forced to relocate to another house after their apartment building was declared not safe anymore for some kind of construction taking place in the nieghbourhood which is affecting it. The man is managing his job at a school as a teacher and the remaining time as a theatre artist along with his wife. The life was as usual, till one day something bad happens to his wife at home in his absence. Now he's raged to find the culprit, but once if he did what happens and how the story ends was the another twist.\n\n?It's obvious you're not the one who found your wife the other day, otherwise you wouldn't say that.?\n\nIt was a very slow start. I mean the opening scene was like racy. And then following, it slowed to build the momentum. That does not mean the characters were developed so well. It only moves forward with constructing what are all needed for later parts. Once it enters the third act, the scenario changes. It looked like another film, another genre. Too tense moment and tight plot for the grand finale. Yep, that is the part makes this film to forget everything you saw in the earlier.\n\nWhatever happened in that part, I felt it was right, though I think culturally it differs the outcome. I mean, that's not philosophically the Iran we know or the religion they worship. You can say the western films badly portrayed them in their films, but if you look at their history, the film ending was shocking. So I thought, the end chaos was for among themselves. If the outsiders (westerners) were involved, it would have been a differently dealt.\n\nVery good performances. But not perfectly written screenplay as I pointed out a few things in the earlier paragraphs. And another thing was, the character, particularly the mysterious one, I was not satisfied how it had been developed. He enters the frame only at the last moment. The narration was very suspense and a bit thriller, but then all the sudden everything comes crumbling down since the end was very near to cease the procession. My point is, how that X man was netted does not make sense in reality. Being a film, it has no problem at all.\n\nSo, it was a good film, but not as good as it was praised or won the Oscars. Yeah, definitely worth a watch. The setting was very good, except the ending, as the opinion differs from people to people and the amount of damage on how to deal with such situation. Overall, a little good message at the end, but not exactly a moral message as it brings more destruction towards the GOOD over the BAD which always win with a strong sentimental grip, no matter whoever involved in it.\n\n6.5/10",

All this takes place while a theatre company, in which the couple are the leads, are in final rehearsal for a production of Death of A Salesman. Set in writer-director, Asghar Farhadis home country of Iran and similar to his previous film, A Separation, which is admittedly better and more engaging, we see another marriage being tested under a set of stressful circumstances. This time, though, it is slightly meandering and sometimes narratively baffling (at least when filtered through our more Western eyes) but nevertheless it is an observant and fascinating film that explores the themes of guilt, shame and forgiveness in a male dominated Muslim society and won him a second Oscar for Movie in a Foreign Language (deservedly beating Toni Erdmann but Land of Mine from Denmark trumps both in my opinion). The couples cultural and intellectual backgrounds give them a sense of modernity that contrast with their more conventional and in the husbands case, primal, reactions. Though I am not convinced how much depth and poignancy the juxtaposition of Arthur Millers play adds to the film and a simpler narrative structure might have been more effective. The middle section sags and works less well than the final section when the culprit is revealed and confronted in a claustrophobic and very theatrical setting, re-energising the film just in time for the powerful, melodramatic and gripping ending.",

I was not able to sit but my whole mind and soul was nailed to the story until it finished. \nMr. Farhadi did it again. Every scene, word, and sound in the movie contributes to the elaboration of this portray that transforms my entire perception of realities. \n\nThis movie is in Tehran and in Farsi and I do not know how much others would feel the depth of the selection of the words and cultural sensitivities.

That is a carpool system from major destinations in the city; like a shuttle service and they take four passengers in a sedan. They used to even carpool 5 passengers until the city made it a law that the front sit can only take one passenger. At that time the front sit was the most uncomfortable sit and usually people paid double to get the whole front sit for herself/himself. \nAt that time it was a common scene that the women were touched inappropriately and they asked the driver to get off the cab or change their sit)\n\nAnyways, please let me know how did you understand the movie and how did you comprehend the cultural contents. \n\nIf you haven't seen the movie yet.

The subtlety of thinking here, which many in the audience will outright reject, is the very foundation of compassion. \"Lock em up and throw away the key\". \"They should have considered the consequences before they did what they did\".

            "content": "Without it yet being an actual problem, watching this felt like Farhadi has become a bit too self-aware, dangerously close to falling into the black hole of his own creativity. A tad too stylized, a lashing too structured, The Salesman is still a profoundly personal movie, anthropocentric to almost a fault without ever crossing that line; a fine balance the filmmaker has proven to be masterful at keeping.\n\nThe story is simple, held elegantly against the backdrop of Miller's Death of a Salesman; a play in which our heroes are portraying the main characters as a recreational activity. The protagonists' plight is being juxtaposed with that of Willy's and Linda's, elevating the sudden darkness befalling their happiness to an allegory pertaining the small; those innocuous details that can either support or break a union in the aftermath of a domestic crisis.\n\nMuch like Willy's burden of mediocrity, Emad is being defined by his own perceived inability to successfully tend to his wife, Rana, in the aftershock of an attack that quickly adorns their skin with wrinkles of instability. Cracks appear, on their walls of their home, the build of their marriage, the very foundation of his mental equilibrium and in the process of his wife's healing, the tables are slowly being turned.\n\nRana lifts her chin in subtle pride as she dusts the burden of self-pity off her bruised shoulders and ventures to reestablish herself in a state of weightless normalcy. All the while, Emad seems to be caving under the pressure of his own contradicting duality -- a man who desperately seeks to regain control of a suddenly derailed life, a husband needing to protect, shield and amend in vengeful anger while, simultaneously, mending in kindness, fear, and worry. Two people journeying through life side by side are now being torn to opposite poles in a way subepidermal enough to have you fearing for their relationship without even realizing at what point exactly you reached that emotional status.\n\nFarhadi's signature move, it would seem.\n\nMy personal gripe. The Salesman cuts deep without pushing -- a beautiful movie featuring some stellar acting by almost everyone involved, no argument there. However, and much to my disappointment, I found it falling short during the third act.\n\nEmad's inner turmoil leads to many spasmodic, irrational reactions from the beginning of the tale but during the last part of the film, the character becomes unrealistic, like the final scene had been already filmed and Farhadi needed to mold something out of nothing to just get us there.\n\nUnderwhelming finish aside, the overall outcome is still worth of tremendous praise, even if, for some of you who might end up sharing my views, it finishes not in thunderous applause but a thoughtful sigh of contentment.",

It was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Foreign Language Film category, but in it really should be also in the Best Writing or the Best Directing category. Soap operas are the hardest genre, as there are hundreds and hundred of mutations of it, everywhere on Earth, in Brazil and Indonesia and South Africa and Germany. Especially those ones which deal with crime, punishment and guilt. Mr. Farhadi won an Oscar in 2011 with his previous brilliant, maybe more devastating but less bloody soap/court-drama, A Separation. And he was also nominated for Best Original Screenplay. He is a brilliant writer and director, one of the great Iranian masters. The acting is powerful as always, and in this film he invites Arthur Miller to help him, in the form of The Death of the Salesman, which the lead characters play in the theater in the film. I met a young student from Bard College in movie theater after the film and we agree that A.F. knows his audience well and got us guessing who is the rapist in this complex and carefully designed moralist crime story, with lots of silences and lies. I know that paradoxically soft dictatorships are inspiring for art, especially for film and theater, as the visual story-tellers should figure out a secret code, a unique language which their audience would understand, but not the censors; or at least the censors would pretend not to. This is not an openly political film, but I can see that Iran, his homeland is the perfect and fertile place for Mr. Farhadi But at the same time I'd urge American Indie producers to hire him asap to write and direct a film in the US, til he can.",

This is a deeply humanist film, exactly the type of movie about assault that Hollywood would never make.  It allows space for every character to react and evolve in relation to the event, often unpredictably, and the script is decent and realistic with all of them, even the perpetrator.  There is suspense and confrontation at the end, but nothing happens as we have been trained to expect.  \n\nOne note - there was a moment of sensory dissonance as we left the theater. The cast of the movie was very dignified, and the audience was maybe half Iranian, and as we left, we filed past a group of young people who were about to perform Rocky Horror live onstage, in full make-up and scandalous attire.

            "content": "IT'S MILLER TIME - My Review of THE SALESMAN (3 1/2 Stars)\n\nIranian filmmakers have long disguised their political dissent by way of  children's parables in order to skirt their nation's stringent censorship board.  THE WHITE BALLOON and BASHU THE LITTLE STRANGER come to mind, but such is not the case with writer/director Asghar Farhadi, whose films about adults play out like silent screams in the face of the patriarchy and governmental bureaucracy.  The former playwright won an Oscar for A SEPARATION and followed it up with THE PAST, starring Berenice Bejo of THE ARTIST.  His latest won the Best Actor and Screenplay awards at the Cannes Film Festival and today scored a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nod.  \n\nWith each successive film, Farhadi's work has felt less stage bound, more cinematic, which is ironic considering the new film uses a production of Arthur Miller's DEATH OF A SALESMAN as its backdrop.  When the film opens, a married couple, Emad (Shahab Hosseini) and Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti) must evacuate their apartment as the walls crumble due to nearby construction gone awry.  It's an apt analogy of the cracks soon to come in their marriage.  Both have taken on the lead roles in the Miller play, with Emad doing double duty as beloved school teacher.  Once safely out of the apartment, the couple move into the temporary digs of a woman who has yet to clear out one room, leaving behind personal belongings and a reputation as a prostitute.  Although the prior tenant never appears in the film, her existence and perceived morality linger over everything that transpires. \n\nOne evening, Rana prepares to take a shower and buzzes her intercom to presumably let her husband into the building.  She leaves the front door open as she heads to the bathroom, the camera lingering on that door for too many beats for anything good to come of it.  It's a masterful moment and one in which I felt Farhadi took a giant leap forward in visual, suspenseful storytelling.  Rana suffers from a traumatic event, the details of which seem murky at best, and Emad makes it his cause to find the perpetrator to exact some type of revenge against him.  Rana's emotional collapse and Emad's obsessions have an impact on the play, which is itself an examination of the last gasps of male power.  \n\nIt's here where the film's true subversiveness slyly makes itself known.  Despite being the victim of a bloody assault, Rana's concerns have little weight next to Emad's quietly seething rage.  While assault goes unreported in most of the world, the decision to go to the authorities have much wider ranging implications in more stringent patriarchal societies such as Iran, where the shame brought on the families can outweigh the needs of the victims.  Farhadi excels in these moments where glances replace reams of dialogue to convey the couples' stifled feelings.  He's helped immeasurably by two actors at the top of their games.  Hosseini justifiably received recognition for perfectly capturing the unraveling of a seemingly gentle man, but it's Alidoosti who astonishes as a woman dying inside not so much from what happened in that bathroom but for being shut out of her own life by the person who loves her the most.  The way she looks at her husband throughout the story feels like a one woman March On Tehran. With her gloriously open expressiveness, she slowly but surely exerts her power as best she can.  She has a similar gift to that of Amy Adams, the ability to be on the verge of tears while exuding commanding strength.  \n\nRather than tend to his wife's needs, Emad plays amateur detective to track down the assailant.  The last third of the film, while still well within the realm of neorealism, carries elements of Hitchcockian suspense such as the way Emad chases after a suspect, or in the quietly shocking way the \"bad guy\" gets revealed.  From there, we're left with the unbearable tension of a revenge fantasy come to awkward, real life.  We feel the messiness of it in the way health issues play into the proceedings, in the way a distraught wife painfully navigates a set of stairs, or in the raw brutality of a slap across a face.  \n\nWhile growing as a visual storyteller, Farhadi gets a little tripped up with his depiction of the play within the movie.  Maybe he resisted the thudding obviousness of using excerpts from the play that has a direct correlation to the main story, but as it stands, the connections seem oblique at best.  I'd suggest brushing up on your SALESMAN knowledge before seeing this film.  It may provide more resonance.  \n\nFarhadi, perhaps in his attempts to get his films made, seems to play both sides by clearly giving voice to women, who get blamed for being temptresses for men, and to men who seemingly have no choice but to exert their power.  The inciting incident in this film affects everyone and everything around them, and yet the person it affects the most matters the least.  The fact that this got past the censors and has become the highest grossing film in Iran tells me even they recognize a problem that can no longer be ignored.  Oh, who am I kidding?  Things may never change.  It's possible for men to stay in power and allow for dissenting voices, right?  It still happens here too.  Farhadi, with his prior films, knew how to engage his audience. With THE SALESMAN, as imperfect as it is and perhaps a tad too dry at times, he has discovered how to haunt us.",

They have to move to another apartment because their apartment is going to collapse. This moving cause a serious issue in their life because of the old tenant.\nIn the beginning of the film when Emad_ with brilliant performance by Shahab Hosseini_ and his students was reading saedi's play Cow, one of his student asked him \"Sir,How does a man become cow?\" Emad answered: \"gradually\". This question and Emad's answer are the main theme of this movie.\nFarhadi has used some part of the play Death of a Salesman in his movie masterfully and he has chosen Emad for the Willy's role in order to show and emphasize how Emad gradually got far away from his family or even his wife just like willy.\nThe last twenty minutes of film are really breathtaking and the spectators associate with Emad more than anytime and I think they regularly ask themselves \"if I were him, what would I do?\"\nThe salesman is a story about revenge or with accurate express is a story about the motivation of revenge.\nThis story like another fahadi's movies occurs in a family and effects family members.\nAfter A separation and now with the salesman Farhadi can be considered as a great master in directing suspenseful family drama like Hitchcock.",
