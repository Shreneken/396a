    "summary": "Now that Chris and his girlfriend, Rose, have reached the meet-the-parents milestone of dating, she invites him for a weekend getaway with Missy and Dean. At first, Chris reads the family's overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries leads him to a truth that he never could have imagined.",

            "content": "The storyline was gripping and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. The themes explored in the movie, such as racism and social commentary, were very relevant and thought-provoking. The acting was also superb, especially by the lead actor Daniel Kaluuya. His portrayal of the main character's emotional journey was truly impressive.\n\nThe cinematography and editing were also very well done. The use of colors and camera angles added to the overall mood and atmosphere of the film. The pacing of the movie was just right, not too slow or too fast, and the suspenseful scenes were executed with great precision.\n\nOverall, \"Get Out\" is a must-see movie that will leave you thinking long after it's over. It's a great example of how horror films can be used to explore deeper social issues, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good thriller.",

            "content": "Horror tension, mystery tension and racial tension blend together into a gripping and formidable nail-biter in \"Get Out,\" the astonishing directorial debut of Jordan Peele. The former half of the comedy duo \"Key & Peele\" has found a way to both honor and subvert the thriller and horror genres in a way that's unmistakably modern.\n\nIn the tradition of \"The Stepford Wives\" with the twist of \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?,\" the story follows a young black man named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) who goes to meet his girlfriend, Rose's (Allison Williams) parents at their fancy estate where things go from slightly uncomfortable in terms of Chris being black to deeply messed up in one slow but inevitable fell swoop.\n\nWith a creepy opening scene showing a different black man getting abducted in a peaceful-seeming suburb, the tone is set immediately that there's cause for concern. Luckily for Chris, Rose is really sensitive to issues of race and prejudice, and even when her parents (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) or brother (Caleb Landry Jones) seem to make Chris' blackness into a thing, the two handle it as best as any interracial couple could. The warning signs come in the form of the Armitage family's black help, maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and groundskeeper Walter (Marcus Henderson), whose behavior is anything but normal.\n\nPeele sets a tone of creepiness largely with the help of composer Michael Abels, also making his feature film debut. The unpredictable nature of Georgina and Walter as characters, the ever-increasing suspicion of all the white characters and the way Peele keeps you nervous about who or what is just outside the frame fuel the fear and paranoia as well as if not better than any horror movie featuring more overtly malevolent forces does.\n\nKaluuya, in a role that will deservedly put him on the map, gives a performance that will connect with viewers who identify with Chris as a man trying to feel comfortable while out of his element experiencing strange things, and those who truly understand Chris' experience as a man of color undergoing the very same events. It would be fascinating to know the different ways a black viewer would experience the film compared to a white one, but the most important thing is that everyone will identify with and feel for Chris.\n\nWhen a little horror film debut like this one gets talents such as Whitford, Keener and Williams, you know the script is good. Peele keeps up the air of mystery a long time even without packing in very many unexpected twists. The awareness of something being wrong but not quite understanding what it going on or why despite getting new information is a real strength of Peele's writing. Then of course there's the brilliant ways that race and the black experience make it into the film. If that weren't enough, Chris' best friend (LilRel Howry) provides comic relief in a way that's stereotypical, yet Peele uses him in unexpected ways. So we get to benefit from Peele's nose for comedy as well.\n\nNot everything adds up by the end of \"Get Out,\" but the film plays out in extremely satisfying fashion. Fans of horror and fans of thrillers who don't mind horror when it's done well should both enjoy the technique and experience. It provides thrills of the pulse-pounding, thrill-seeking and thought-provoking variety and few genre films can say the same.",

            "content": "(Spoilers) Jordan Peele's superb sci-fi thriller is a clever black variation on the Stepford Wives.  Instead of women being replaced by imposter-robots, we have an evil cult of white people, living in Connecticut, who lure black people into their social circle.  Then they drug them; subdue them; and then implant their white brains into the young, strong, healthy black bodies.  It's not hard to read the metaphor here: Peele is criticizing white appropriation of black culture; and white exploitation of the black community as a whole.  I'd say this Stepford Wives remake is actually much better than the original.  Ira Levin's 70s feminist thriller was a bit of a one trick pony.  It played it's hand early, and stayed with it's simple plot to the end.  And it had an ugly heavy-handed finale; where Katherine Ross is destroyed by the evil Stepford Husbands and is turned into a Fembot, with all her friends similarly destroyed.  The ending was so dark it caused many feminists to misread the story as misogynistic.  This was not what Levin intended; he was trying to do a feminist version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers; which decried women's subjugation to patriarchal culture; not celebrated it.  Peele on the other hand keeps you guessing; the plot is more twisty and unpredictable; and he doesn't kill off his hero just to make some point.  (That would have ruined the ending). It's also quite funny.  (Not surprising since Peele is one half of the famous Key and Peele comedy team).  This movie is very entertaining; thrilling, and fun; and it makes nice points about exploitation and cultural appropriation without getting bogged down in its own politics and getting ugly.  It's also nice to see a movie which is in some ways a return to the serious and socially-conscious sci-fi films of the 60s and 70s: Rosemary's Baby, A Clockwork Orange, The Twilight Zone; Planet of the Apes; Soylent Green; these were all Sci-Fi shows and movies which had a point; which had a strong political message attached.  They had some strong criticism of social trends in our culture; or man's foibles in general; or contained observations and lessons about culture and society.  Somewhere along the line; about the time Star Wars came out; sci-fi dropped it's serious and political bent and became mindless escapism; and that was a huge loss.  Hopefully Get Out represents a reversal of that trend.",

As challenging as it was for its time, it comes across as positively cosy compared with this movie. Get Out delves much deeper into the innate racism that most people have built into their psyche. It is a genuinely disturbing movie: as much a psychological thriller as a horror, set in rural isolation, away from the safety of a more accepting, multicultural city. On the surface, everything seems innocent enough, but … The disturbing, nonconsensual psychotherapy scene alone should be enough to unsettle anyone. From the strange behaviour of the black help to the uncertainties feared by the boyfriend, with nods to various class and racial stereotyping, no matter how broadmindedly hip you think you are, this should have you questioning your own thoughts and attitudes towards race, and mixed race relationships. This is one movie that pushes aside any notion of coziness to challenge the subject at every level, no matter what race or class you happen to be.",

Uma cidade pequena do interior dos EUA. Onde a filha do casal Catherine e Bradley, usam sua filha Alisson a fisgar tanto homens e mulheres negras, pois a fisiologia deles é mais forte. E desta vez quem ela fisgou? Daniel. Um casal lindo, que vai visitar os pais delas no interior. Ele sem suspeitar de nada vai. Participa da hipnose da \"sogra\" e participa de uma festa entre os amigos da família. Tipo para apresentar ele para as pessoas, mas ele sem saber de nada. Mas acaba suspeitando o agir dos criados negros da casa e um dos maridos negros que veio na festa. Nesse momentoele começa desconfiar de algo. E tenta ir embora, até que a ele é pego pela hipnose. Quando acorda esta amarrado na cadeira e participando das hipnoses e assim descobrindo toda a trama, até que chega o momento de fazer o transplante dos cérebros e o louco do Caleb que o irmão de Allison vai busca-lo. Ele consegue fugir, mas sera que conseguirá sair vivo da casa? Só assistindo.\nRoteiro: bem elaborado\nVale apena assistir? Sim\nNota: 8,5",

Add to that a very promising trailer, the award nominations and wins and mostly positive word of mouth (even with the very vocal detractors), and interest was higher.\n\nHigh expectations were not only met but also exceeded. Apologies for the cliché, but to me that is the best way to sum up my personal experience watching 'Get Out'. Can totally see why it was as well received as it was, though can also see why it has divided audiences on here. While it will never be one of my favourite films, 'Get Out' is among the better films of 2017 and does live up to the hype.\n\nIt's an incredibly well-made film visually, with stylish and unsettling cinematography and editing and some disturbingly surreal imagery that adds to, and enhances, the unease and sense of dread.\n\nThat the direction was done by a first-time director is a shock in itself, one of the most outstanding debut directing jobs seen in a long time by me. It's nostalgic in its embracing of contemporary and classic horror and also brave in the accomplished handling of the film's combative themes.\n\nBeing somebody who considers music important when talking about it, the music looms suitably ominously and fits well. 'Get Out' benefits from an extremely smart and clever script (though 'The Shape of Water' and especially 'Lady Bird' were worthier wins for the Best Original Screenplay Oscar in my view), that takes on a lot of elements and balances them adeptly and the individual elements handled very effectively.\n\nDespite how it sounds, 'Get Out' struck me as more of a thriller with horror and comedic elements. It is highly successful on this front, with the thriller elements being taut, suspenseful and unsettling, the comedic ones being darkly funny and clever and the horror ones being imaginatively shocking and subtly uneasy. There is even some social commentary and interracial themes explored, and done thoughtfully and just about avoids preachiness while hitting hard still.\n\nWhile all the performances are very fine, it is Daniel Kaluuya's superb lead performance that burns in the memory the most.\n\nMy only complaint of 'Get Out' is the too pat and somewhat silly ending that felt tacked on and like it came out of a different film, to me it too ended on a tonally jarring and that's it note.\n\nUntil then, the film was this close to being a masterpiece. So it was frustrating that it just missed out on that distinction. Nonetheless it's a great film that is among the year's better ones, brought down by an underwhelming ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Que se hace más evidente en ciertas escenas, como la presentación de la fiesta donde Chris se siente incómodo por no sentirse perteneciente a ella y que se evidencia más con los prejuicios internos de todos los invitados hacia el y que culmina de una gran manera con la frase de \"No es lo que dices si no como lo dices\", esa escena técnicamente es perfecta, ya que en ella se expone el conflicto interno de la película y se establece el suspenso de la misma; Que gracias al espectacular soundtrack de Michael Abels introduce muy bien al espectador a la agonía de la casa y al encierro de la misma, que por varios momentos llega a ser estresante, conectado muy bien con la gran actuación de Daniel Kaluuya, (que más allá del meme), la escena de la primera hipnotización es brillante ya que específicamente en esa escena demuestra todo su nivel actoral, demostrando la agonía y la incertidumbre del ambiente en el que está involucrado, manteniendo y entendiendo cada escena y como su personaje desde su POV reacciona a las circunstancias, armando el rompecabezas con el espectador. Si tuviera que decir algo que no me encantó de la película sería que por momentos Jordan Peele llega a ser un poco sobre explicativo para que a todos los espectadores les quede claro en conflicto y ciertas metáforas puntuales de la película, que aunque no está mal si llega a conducir a algunos diálogos forzados.  \n\nJordan Peele y su equipo hacen un trabajo brillante, supieron como construir un mensaje que sin sentirse forzado logra ser efectivo, ya que ataca a la sutilidad, como la escena en la que se presenta el personaje de Andre y a su esposa, que bien podría representar como la gente moldea a las personas y que inconscientemente los aleja de sus raíces. O la escena en la que el personaje de Rod va con la policía, que para mi representa como la polícia no ataca los problemas de toda la gente por igual desacreditando la versión de ciertas personas por como se ven. Get Out, es una crítica sobre el racismo que con tintes surrealistas cuentan una historia que te hará estar al filo del asiento en toda la película, que en su narrativa logra sentirse auténtica. Todos los involucrados regalan un trabajo técnicamente perfecto para que te sientas estresado y pendiente en cada detalle de la misma.",

Its a difficult film to categorise but its certainly eery and unsettling and it does have an atmospheric feel to it. \n\nIt was clear to me that its about racism but not direct racism, not obvious racial slurs as such but about a sort of swept under the carpet form of racism, a sub-conscious kind of it - its hard to explain. It has almost a Hitchcockian feel, with the main character seeming to be made to feel uncomfortable and unwelcome but if he were to say this outloud as such and challenge it, it would be hard to explain precisely why he felt that way. It really is one of those films that you have to see and make your own mind about, I suppose. There is a decent amount of suspense and certainly a heavy dose of tension brewing under the surface, as it were, although if you break it down, for most of the duration the physical things going on aren't necessarily, on their own, that worrying. It could be said that paranoia is at play but I certainly found myself feeling concerned and unsure, as Chris did.\n\nI did feel that the music was, at times, a little over the top, a bit obvious perhaps but I wouldn't say its too big an issue. Its a good film and I'd recommend it if your interested in it, as long as your not hoping for an all out slasher fest type watch.",

A total fresh take with original story, this movie is interwined with foreshadowing through and through. Everything in it has a purpose, there's a foundation for all that happens. Peele serves the audience a not-so-usual-in-media view on racism through satire with chilling horror elements, which leave you feeling unsettled more than anything. This film doesn't tackle the theme of racism in the classic 'republican' way, just for the sake of checking a box for a character development. It rather focuses on the \"passive\" racism from 'liberal democrats', which isn't a typical on-screen portray we would see often. It's good to see a piece of media that portrays the reality of those experiences, rather than just traumatize the character with no intention of further plot or actual representation. At the very end, let's not overlook the spectacular casting; Daniel Kaluuya and the way he can act through his eyes should be studied. The scariest part of this movie is, though, how real it actually is.",

It's lovely to see inquisitive, competent protagonists that try to learn more and then want to bail once they feel they've put enough of the pieces together. Tying in Chris' backstory with the Sunken Place was absolutely masterful, and is what pushed this into 5 star territory. He sat by doing nothing, watching a TV screen, as his mother lay dying from the hit and run. And in the Sunken Place, where he can't move or speak (where he can do nothing), the only image of the outside world is through a shrunken film frame that looks just like a TV screen would. So good.

From beginning to end the story bumbles along the all-too-tread road of white = bad, black = innocent and \"trapped.\" It is a tale that has been told 1,000 times in the last 50 years.  And because it is such condescendingly low-hanging fruit I pretty much anticipated a resounding cheer from our black countrymen. What I did not expect was the bandwagon response amongst all other ethnicities. My continued surprise is derived from the fact that, as a whole, \"Get Out\" is simply not a very good film, let alone a good horror film. \nAs a lifelong horror fan, I expect the unexpected; the \"different\" when it comes to highly anticipated \"must-sees.\" There are multiple sub-genres of horror with no boundaries, making horror a somewhat easy category for up-and-coming directors to try something new and daring. Thus, it should have been even easier from someone with the industry ties Mr. Peele enjoyed prior to this debut to really stretch the limits of this malleable genre. Yet this film offered neither the new nor the daring. It was a bland, uncooked potato topped with a so-called plot-twist involving one of the single most overused suspense tropes aside from amnesia. Once this was revealed as the culprit, my eyes rolled so wildly I almost fell into the seat next to me. An already boring movie became not only incredibly corny, but almost intolerable from that moment forward. The \"a-ha\" moment is about as fresh as the breadcrumbs in the bottom of my toaster. \nFinally, I find it incredibly problematic that, as a half-white/half-black man, time and again Mr. Peele consistently falls to only one end of his family history. His identity seems almost consumed by his blackness. I often wonder how the white side of his family feels about his continued contempt, belittling, condemnation, and razzing of their heritage, their culture. We get it, Mr. Peele: you have black ancestry. But you also have just as much white ancestry. Why, then, this deep-seeded need for your repeated, almost labored, reassertion that blacks be at the forefront of your films when you have the ability to simply make films with \"people\" in them?\nBut if you must continue to make films with black main characters, whether for street-cred or because of some identity conflict, I only ask that you please write something more ground-breaking.",

So much for nail-biting horror. 🙄 \n\nThe core concept doesn't even sell or make sense. I like body horror fine, and it can be completely ridiculous and over the top - like Reanimator, or a Cronenberg offering - but you have to sustain some coherence and a consistent world, and at least _somewhat_ maintain believability, within the construct.  I guess maybe \"some\" percentage of the population walks around this paranoid, and \"horrifically\" \"buys\" the premise that most of the the world is actually out to get them, and snatch them for [\"spoiler\" 🙄]. But this take just doesn't sell for me. \n\nI think some aspects were trying to split the horror/comedy gap - like a Simon Pegg & Nick Frost offering, without their  successful timing & execution.  🤷🏻‍♂️",

Add to that a very promising trailer, the award nominations and wins and mostly positive word of mouth (even with the very vocal detractors), and interest was higher.\n\nHigh expectations were not only met but also exceeded. Apologies for the cliché, but to me that is the best way to sum up my personal experience watching 'Get Out'. Can totally see why it was as well received as it was, though can also see why it has divided audiences on here. While it will never be one of my favourite films, 'Get Out' is among the better films of 2017 and does live up to the hype.\n\nIt's an incredibly well-made film visually, with stylish and unsettling cinematography and editing and some disturbingly surreal imagery that adds to, and enhances, the unease and sense of dread.\n\nThat the direction was done by a first-time director is a shock in itself, one of the most outstanding debut directing jobs seen in a long time by me. It's nostalgic in its embracing of contemporary and classic horror and also brave in the accomplished handling of the film's combative themes.\n\nBeing somebody who considers music important when talking about it, the music looms suitably ominously and fits well. 'Get Out' benefits from an extremely smart and clever script (though 'The Shape of Water' and especially 'Lady Bird' were worthier wins for the Best Original Screenplay Oscar in my view), that takes on a lot of elements and balances them adeptly and the individual elements handled very effectively.\n\nDespite how it sounds, 'Get Out' struck me as more of a thriller with horror and comedic elements. It is highly successful on this front, with the thriller elements being taut, suspenseful and unsettling, the comedic ones being darkly funny and clever and the horror ones being imaginatively shocking and subtly uneasy. There is even some social commentary and interracial themes explored, and done thoughtfully and just about avoids preachiness while hitting hard still.\n\nWhile all the performances are very fine, it is Daniel Kaluuya's superb lead performance that burns in the memory the most.\n\nMy only complaint of 'Get Out' is the too pat and somewhat silly ending that felt tacked on and like it came out of a different film, to me it too ended on a tonally jarring and that's it note.\n\nUntil then, the film was this close to being a masterpiece. So it was frustrating that it just missed out on that distinction. Nonetheless it's a great film that is among the year's better ones, brought down by an underwhelming ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

It's listed on this site as the 2nd best horror film of all time - you've got to be kidding. The fact that it is, I suppose, afro-centric, should be neither here nor there. Even thinking of it in those terms is intrinsically racist - it's good because it's good, that's all that should matter. It isn't great - it's let down by its final act - & that's without the imbecilic alternate ending in which apparently, in the face of all, you know, readily available evidence, the police are just automatically going to arrest the black guy. Is that what happens? Really? Do you really think that's how justice works in the U.S.? Ironically, despite ridiculous tags like 'subversive', the film squibs on why black men (& woman) are the targets. Would have been a better film if it hadn't, then it might have been saying more than it actually does, but it still wouldn't have been subversive. That's infantile. The reality is that a lot of the people who are over the top about the import of this one are in effect patting the black guy on the head & telling him how clever he is. The actual film itself is irrelevant. If you look at the actual film though, rather than the colour of the skin of the person who made it - it's a high quality effort that I highly recommend, despite that fact that it runs out of ideas at the end & just settles on killing everybody. It is absolutely in the top 10-20 horror films of the 21st Century. It is not by any stretch of the imagination, the 2nd best horror film of all time.",

It does what other movies are too scared to do which is to address race and makes it the focal point of the film. For some odd reason, Jordan Peele starts off the movie with an unnamed black character who is knocked out in the middle of the night and kidnapped by a person in a white car. Instead of the continuation of this scene, we are introduced to an African American photographer named Chris Washington and his Caucasian girlfriend Rose Armitage. We find out that the two of them are going to Rose's family since she wants to introduce them to Chris. Next, Chris asks Rose \"does your family know I'm black\" in which Rose hesitantly responds with \"n-no\". Jordan Peele ingeniously introduces two points of racial tension at the beginning of the film that makes the viewer bite at their nails with anticipation knowing full well that Chris will be facing exactly what he fears most at the Armitage house. We are then revealed to the white mother, father, and brother of the Armitage family and their two black employed servants. The juxtaposition of the races and roles of the Armitage family and their servants clearly convey the theme of racial inequality. Later, the Armitage host a party with mostly old white attendants and 1 black one. The white guests repeated uncomfortable praises of the black race and the weird behaviors of the only other 3 black people make both Chris and the viewer think that he is the odd one out. The consistent strange behaviors of the people at the party and Rose's indifference to this really generates the idea that something is seriously wrong. This feeling of unease hits its climax when 1 of the black guests has a nosebleed and yells at Chris to get out after a flash picture was taken of him. Overall, Get Out is a well-put-together movie that explores the fears of the African American population through an entertaining and gut-wrenching horror movie. The continuous rise of tension does a splendid job at symbolizing the fear that black people feel in a America that is at some times, unwelcoming to them. The contrast between race and job also does a good job at reflecting the economic inequalities faced in modern America. Now the movie is not free without its flaws. The action scenes don't seem realistic at all, especially not with that cheap and bright red CGI blood. Also, the existence of Rose's stack of photos feels like it was thrown in there to further the plot as there was no good reason given as to why Rose would have these photos and kept them in the place she did. Nevertheless, Jordan Peele's brilliant script and all of the actors' amazing acting really sell the pitch of Get Out. That the lives of black people in America can sometimes feel like something straight out of a horror movie.",

            "content": "Get Out is a very clever, smart and effective horror movie. The writing and directing are superb and manage to deliver a movie with some interesting racial undertones. Peele actually uses these undertones to complement the horror in this movie and try to work around the obvious cliches and stereotypes that are present from the very beginning. The acting supplements this beautifully by leaving no ambiguity regarding those stereotypes and cliches and creates really interesting characters and relationships and interactions between those characters. It also creates some genuinely really funny moments which are perfectly placed juxtapositions to the freakiness and unease that dominates so much of this movie. That is actually one of the things I like most about this movie; it's horror, but not in the conventional sense. This film doesn't rely on jump scares whatsoever and more focuses on being smart and crafting a really unique and interesting story. This movie has some really freaky and uncomfortable moments and interactions that give viewers so much unease and anxiety regarding what will happen next. Get Out has great intellectual and social horror within it and the acting gives that so much depth and makes it even freakier. The characters in the movie do some really smart stuff which is a testament to the writing and directing and helps some scenes to be really engaging and clever. The film flows very smoothly and there are no disruptive or awkward moments that hurt the quality of the scenes. It makes a lot of sense and doesn't rely on paranormal, supernatural or fantasy stuff to be unsettling or further along the plot, making this movie very different from other horror movies such as the Insidious and Conjuring franchises. Get Out is also an academic movie. If you're studying film in college, grad school or just as a career, you'll recognize concepts regarding spectatorship in some scenes of the movie. Thus, Get Out is capable of reaching audiences in a way a lot of other horror movies aren't and don't, making it truly unique as a work of art. It's not often that I can say that a horror flick is academic and contains college level concepts in it, and I'm thankful that I can do it with this one. The movie doesn't leave out the \"ah-ha\" moments of clarification, and makes them creative on their own by having certain things become clear and culminate. The end is nice and has a really funny moment in it that helps to perfectly wrap up the movie. Overall, Get Out is a fantastic movie and is a must-see for horror fans due to how unique and thought-provoking it is.",

            "content": "Jordan Peele's 2017 debut film as director, Get Out, is a modern horror masterpiece that plays on the reversal of racist horror tropes while also displaying contemporary covert racism to create a new type of horror film, one that bypasses gore and jump scares and embraces diversity, ultimately appealing to a modern audience that is far more open to conversations about race. \nThe horror genre, which is rooted in literature and has since gained massive popularity through film and television, has a long history of deeply embedded racism. Black characters were often used in horror only as sacrificial lambs, sidekicks, and even supernatural beings alongside their white counterparts. Dick Halloran in The Shining, for instance, \"shines\" like Danny Torrance and yet is the only character to be killed in the film. It was extremely rare for Black characters in horror to make it to the end of the film and even rarer for them to be lead characters. Get Out completely reverses this trope by centering Black characters, allowing them to survive, and making them the heroes of the film. This fairly unprecedented creative choice in Get Out only heightens the film's cultural significance.\nThe true horrors of Get Out are the very realistic instances of covert and overt racism threaded into the film. Upon visiting his white girlfriend's family for the weekend, Chris Washington is repeatedly fetishized, stereotyped, and treated as an \"other.\" It becomes increasingly clear throughout the film that Chris is an outsider. With this realization, Chris and the audience alike become increasingly uncomfortable. In horror, and American history as a whole, there are racist cultural conventions portraying Black people as villains and white people as victims. By reversing this trope, Peele offers audiences a new horror film experience -- one that speaks on modern racism in popular culture and appeals to the increased diversity that horror audiences crave. \nBetween its uniqueness, its nods to horror legend The Shining, its incredible acting and visuals, and its very relevant commentary on race in America, Jordan Peele's Get Out is a must-see. The film does not shy away from addressing the realities of being Black in America, from covert microaggressions to an uneasy relationship with the police. Get Out is frightening not because of a monster under the bed, but rather the monster in bed with Chris. The horrors of racism are a reality and that is what makes the film so captivatingly horrific. A new cultural staple, you cannot call yourself a horror buff or pop culture aficionado without watching.",
