The sequel was not very well put together and aside from the amazing performance by the contortionist in the well chase sequence, is not fondly remembered for anything. This movie looked to put a new spin on the Ring mythos with its own story. It attempted to take modern technology, the infamous videotape and a bevy of new abilities for Samara to explain their new storyline. However, what we got was something akin to 2 hours of jump scares mixed with bad acting and CGI Samara. This movie needed to keep Samara away from the spotlight, take some notes from the original Jaws movie. She was on screen more in this film then she ever had been in the previous 2 films. Going forward with this character and this franchise, we need Samara to be a malicious murderer who only kills based on the viewing of her video and there is no real way to stop her once you watch the tape. My disappointment in this film is solely based on me wanting to see Samara become more of a slasher killer like Freddie Krueger and not constantly be told to sympathize with her.",

            "content": "Man, a friend of mine recommended that I watch Bad Match (sort of a Tinder date from hell type of movie) and I had to be a stubborn asshole and watch this instead.  I mean, really, I've been without Prime for nine months and, honestly, a lot of the movies that I wanna see were not gonna go away immediately.  So why, exactly, did I have to watch this tonight?  Honestly, I have no fucking clue.  I wanted to watch a horror movie and, somehow, this was the one I settled on.  Honestly, I was a fan of the original Ring.  It was actually one of the very few J-horror remakes that actually, in my opinion, to capture the spirit of the original movie it was based on (and book) while adding its own touches.  The surrealistic visuals of the contents of the tape were a strong suit as was the way the atmosphere was built throughout.  I remember watching the original Ring remake in theaters and I remember the reaction of everyone when the girl came out of the TV.  It was, honestly, quite something to see.  It's obvious that the original remake was wildly successful so, obviously, it was followed up by a terrible sequel that all but killed the franchise.  A sequel made by the man responsible for the Japanese movies.  The sequel for the remake and the sequel for the Japanese original (Ringu) were released the same year, something that I did not know until now actually.  Interesting little factoid right there.  The Ring 2 was released 13 years ago, so, of course, at some point, this franchise was going to be revived.  Because everything old is new again and, honestly, with the proliferation of smartphones, sites like YouTube, DailyMotion, among others, updating this story for a more modern world, honestly, seemed like a good idea.  What has changed from 2002 (the release of the original remake) and 2017 (the year of this film's release) should have been the film's focal point and how easier it is for people to share things with each other nowadays.  Of course, though, because apparently this movie was made with sequels in mind (because of course it was, given that Paramount ran Paranormal Activity into the ground with its, almost, yearly sequels), we didn't get to see a, potentially, really cool movie.  If you're not gonna use a cool idea to build your story around, at least give us an enjoyable horror movie with good atmosphere, tension and solid scares.  Nope.  Apparently that's too much to ask for as well.  I honestly don't know what this movie was meant to be.  A remake, a soft reboot, a homage.  Because, quite frankly, it repeats most of what you already saw with nowhere near the same level of skill.  To say that this is a horror movie would be an insult to horror movies everywhere (even the bad ones).  I mean, there's horror movies that aren't scary that still fit into the genre.  Hell, almost every horror movie I see isn't scary and they still fit into the description.  I guess someone could make the argument that, as bad as this is, this also still belongs to the genre.  I guess there's also some validity to that, but when you look at the content within the film and just the sheer lack of scares, or even attempts at one, there are in this movie, it's just sort of difficult to justify it as a horror movie.  This is, at best, a suspense/mystery/thriller.  The movie sees Julia investigating the disappearance of this young pregnant teen as a result of the visions she's been seeing.  Basically, her boyfriend watched the video while he was at college and he has seven days to find a tail (someone else to watch the video to pass the curse to) before he dies.  Julia sacrifices herself to save her boyfriend from the curse.  But, of course, since Julia is our lead character, there's a video within the original video from the Ring (which is still surrealistic and creepy).  This new video, of course, doesn't have nearly the same effect the original had and it supremely lacks in the creepiness department.  Anyway, this new video leads her to investigate, again, the disappearance of this pregnant teen 30 or so years ago which will, hopefully, lead her to where Samara's remains are so she can be given a proper burial to put a stop to the events.  First things first, and this has nothing to do with the the film itself (except that it does) and that is how strict Samara is about rules.  She'll kill you, but you have to watch her video first, ok, guys?  Even if there's someone else in the room, who didn't watch the video (like Julia was during Skye's death), she WANTS to kill you, but she WON'T.  You have to watch the video, Silly McSillypants.  I mean, this is something you don't think about in the original Ring because of how good the movie actually is.  But, in a terrible movie, you start to think about this type of shit.  It's a little ridiculous, but it is what it is.  Julia finds out that her boyfriend is part of this secret college group, all of whom have watched the video and all of whom have found tails, and she meets this college professor who's trying to study how this video proves that there's an afterlife after all.  Why is this professor trying to study this, I don't even know, and, honestly, after the shit starts and Julia and Holt (her boyfriend) start investigating the disappearance, this is dropped entirely.  So, honestly, why even bother???  I think it's enough for them to tell us that there's a lot of people who are involved in this who have found a tail, you can even include Holt's professor in this (who was the one who started the chain).  But what's the point of the secret study group if it's literally gonna go nowhere.  I know you kept things open-ended enough to, maybe, justify sequels.  But you can't just assume that your shitty movie is going to be successful enough.  There's other ways to justify sequels if you really need to, just tell a complete story in this movie, then worry about sequels afterwards, if this proves successful enough.  Regardless, that's neither here nor there I suppose.  The movie is more about Julia and Holt's investigation into this missing teen and, I'll be honest, it's really fucking boring.  It's bad, but it's more boring than bad.  The reason, however, that this movie gets the rating it does is because of how fucking terrible Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz is in the lead role.  This young woman has gone on to star in a critically-acclaimed movie called Revenge that, unsurprisingly, I want to see.  So I'll have to hold off judgment for how good she is (or not) until I see that flick.  All I can give an opinion on is her performance here and, I'll be honest, I don't think I've seen a performance THIS bad in a really long fucking time.  I'm really struggling to think of the last time I saw someone this bad in a lead role.  There's obvious comparisons to be made between Ingrid in this movie and Hayden Christensen in the Star Wars prequels.  But, to be fair, Hayden proved to be a legacy terrible actor, it wasn't just that the Star Wars prequels were poorly written and not even Daniel Day-Lewis could make that script look good.  In Ingrid's case, it might just be a problem of choosing the worst possible cuts of her performance.  Then again, if what we got to see on screen were the best cuts that were filmed, can you even imagine how bad the worst must have been???  Look, this movie wouldn't have been good with or without a good lead performance.  The fact of the matter is that Vincent Donofrio is good in the limited role he's given and, still, the movie sucked.  The problem just comes in recycling old elements from the original movie instead of using the NEW concept that's so obviously staring you in the face.  And if you even recycled old concepts and ideas from the original remake and, at the very least, executed them WELL.  But no, you can't even do that.  No real effort was put into understanding why the remake worked so well.  They just looked at everything at face value and tried to repeat that without, again, any of the skill involved.  It just doesn't work that way.  You have to understand why things worked and how to properly adapt that to a new audience in the digital age, where everything is online instantly.  This movie was destined to be a failure from the start, because they didn't learn why the original movie worked.  So, basically, the concept I'm talking about, that this movie should have used from the start, is what if the video itself went viral on YouTube...or the equivalent thereof, since sometimes these films don't use real sites.  What if millions, maybe even billions, of people watched the video and all started dropping dead in seven days.  That concept doesn't mean that the movie would be good, of course, since you still need someone skillful enough to handle this.  But, at the very least, conceptually speaking, you have a more interesting movie than what we did end up getting.  And the thing is, unfortunately, that the video going viral online (or forcefully shared to Holt and Julia's friends at least) was actually used as the ENDING.  Literally the only cool thing about the movie is left for the end.  Samara has manipulated and used Julia to cross over into our world, or something, and the video ended up being shared with everyone on Julia's friend's list.  Cue Sir Patrick Stewart's facepalm.  They're like 'oh, you wanna see this as a full-fledged movie, well FUCK YOU, because we're saving this for a sequel that will never be made'.  It's really such a big fuck you to hardcore horror fans.  I sat through 95+ minutes of bullshit to get a cool ending that's hinting at bigger things for a sequel that will never be made because of how shitty this movie was.  It's really like a slap to the face, honestly.  Perhaps that's an overreaction on my part.  But, seriously, holy fucking shit.  Who thought that reintroducing the franchise with THIS movie would be a great idea?  You have to change with the times and it's been 20 years since the Japanese original came out.  It's been 16 years since the remake.  That's a lot of time to, essentially, make the same fucking movie again with all the changes in technology that we've seen since then.  Infuriating.  If the sequel to the remake (The Ring 2) all but killed the franchise, this movie has sex with its corpse and sets it on fire after the act.  Just an absolute terrible and poor excuse for a movie.  Downgraded from the one star I was gonna give it.  There's just nothing redeemable about this, it's just awful.",

This film tries to pull a 'Jurassic World' and 'Force Awakens' by being exactly like the original film, the plot is beat by beat the same as the original, except instead of Samara being on a VHS, she's digital. There's literally a scene where Samara appears on a phone and she comes out of it, except there are like these birds that surround her so you never see her coming out of the phone, because a little Samara coming out of the phone would've been too funny. This movie is hysterical, the acting is awful especially from the lead actress, who doesn't have a character to work with, she's so bland. Also the kills come across as comedic since they're edited horribly. The opening of this movie has nothing to do with the overall plot, but takes place in a plane and I burst out laughing by the end of it it's so horribly done, and comes across like a spoof from 'Scary Movie'. The plot twists in this film are some of the most predictable ever. This movie isn't scary, there's no tension, the plot doesn't make sense. It's literally the first movie except it has different characters, and it's modern day. On the positive sides of this movie, the visuals are nice, it's nicely shot, it's the best looking Ring movie, everything else is awful. If you want a good laugh from this movie go ahead and watch it, otherwise I don't recommend.",

The concept offers up a single cool idea that definitely should have been its focus but, instead, the film feels like it is just redoing the first film all over again by having the main character investigate the tragic past of the ghost that refuses to get with the times and continues to cling to VHS tapes as a legitimate medium.  The problems are only amplified when you add in flat and bland characters with an atmosphere that has no sense of horror or dread and it made for a movie that dragged and never really picks up ever.  The cast is doing their best with what limited canvases they were given to work with but it's not enough to help this snoozer.  Overall, \"Rings\" comes off like a phoned in stand-alone sequel that feels more at home with the Direct-to-Video market than anything else.\n\nHello!  My name is Rev.

            "content": "It appears to be an inevitable progression from any degree of success quickly spawns a sequel, and if it sustains even a modicum of momentum, it will progress onto a franchise. Evidence of this is phenomina manifest in a wide varriety of genres but is most pronounced in horror movies. That category of entertainment seems to possess a significant degree of protection from the unavoidable phenomenon known as diminishing returns. Widely accepted criteria can quantify each continuous film in the ever expanding series of movies steadily ddclining spiral as box office returns and rankings in aggregate review sites. The original film of the series, referring to the 2002 American not Japanese variation, was a respectable 71% on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2005 its first sequel, Ring Two go to a Run Tomato ranking of 20%. Finally, 12 years later, the consideration, Rings has plummeted to an abysmal 9%. The priming prospect for those who enjoy quality all movies is that with a budget of $25 million to fill rate in a domestic box office of almost $28 million. Then he seemed like a very slim margin, not really of consideration by the studio, but that does not include global markets and the exceptionally lucrative DVD/Blu-ray sales and licensing arrangements with premium cable networks and streaming video services. Over the past few years, there has been a radical decline in the stigma against movies released directly to video. This method of distribution once stigmatized a film as largely because of that format, once the pariah of cinema, has become a respected venue for independent films. For those who are interested in watching how the premise of the series can reach its fullest potential check out the Japanese versions of the movies. That premise has a certain purity and simplicity within the context of horror. Anyone watching a particular videotape that consists of a string of bizarre images receives a phone call or macabre voice telling them that they will die within seven days. The only way to save your life is to make a copy of the videotape and get someone else to watch it. The back and be done within the allotted period the curse is lifted from you and reset to the new victim.\n\nThis installment takes place in the present opening in an airplane on its way to Seattle. A pair of the passengers, Carter (Zach Roerig) and Kelly (Lizzie Brocher\u00e9), realizes that they have seen the Samara Morgan's cursed videotape. They're coming up upon that crucial seven-day mark of their predicted demise. The hope to out run the curse but the vengeance is Samara was not to be denied. She reaches out from beyond the grave causing the plane to malfunction and crash. A couple of years later college professor Gabriel (Johnny Galecki) purchases are used VCR previously owned by a passenger of that ill-fated flight. On examining his purchase, he noticed that there's a videotape already in the old machine. The scene shifts to Julia (Matilda Lutz)) were addressing her boyfriend, Holt (Alex Roe), off to college. After a brief time, she becomes a concern when Holt seems to disappear, no longer communicating with her in any fashion. Julie has just come to the decision to investigate his whereabouts. She encounters a young woman in a complete state of panic, Skye (Aimee Teegarden) was gravely worried about Holt. Julie winds up speaking to Gabriel who takes into a rather reclusive area on campus. Then he took her into a room and introduced to a group called the 'Sevens.' They are attempting a scientific study of the cursed videotape. Part of the protocol of the project is for them to watch the video while filming themselves and then passing it on to the secondary group of people known as the 'Tail.'\n\nAlthough the harsh reality of the precipitous plunge in quality is one aspect of the general plot points that have been in desperate need of addressing. It appears that demons have not kept up with modern technology. VCR tapes have been all but extinct for over a decade. Hell is in dire need of a technological upgrade. If you want to see hell as I picture it within the context of the series check out the series on Adult Swim, 'Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell.' It depicts the place of eternal torment as run by a bureaucracy consisting of inept; bungling demons who are still using IBM ATs with large VGA monitors. The people setting up the parameters of the investigation have decided to transfer the tape to digital video file format. After all, the point is to get people to watch the film and me for Samara to have her revenge spamming an email or attaching it to various 'clip-bait online videos' that can quickly reach a far wider audience. This also comes in handy with a level plot contrivance of additional material added to the video. A quick glance at the file size would inform anyone that the original movie ws altered. It now contains a scene of what happens is Samara after her death. When Skye takes Julia to her apartment to view the video, she is contacted by Holt wanting her against watching the deadly video. She refrains from watching the video, but in the next room, Skye is murdered.\n\nIt appears that the format used to produce the script was to write some horror movie tropes and oxides on slips of paper, place them in a hat and pullout plot contrivances until the script size is sufficient for a feature-length movie. The hotel is Samara's body has been very strange marks on his hands. They turn out written in braille which once deciphered these into a sufficiently spooky location that could very well have been a set left over from the film. It was an introduction to a blind man who knows why the gravesite is missing a body that a flood necessitated moving it. When they get around to electrocuting a person using a falling utility pole any cannot help but recall a substantial number of movies utilizing the same 'shocking moment.' The time came quickly when a chours of chriping cicaders ae heared in the background. Accompaning this expected contrivances leading to the telegraphed hidden room and sudden pregnacy. Any desparate hope of originality is receeding in your rearview mirror at light speed. What is truly disappointing about this movie is that it contains some notable names containing not only Johnny Galecki coming on for 'The Big Bang Theory' and Aimee Teegarden known for among many other things from her starring roles in 'Friday Night Lights' and the sci-fi variation of Romeo and Juliet, 'Star-Crossed.' Lizzie Brocher\u00e9 is a very talented French actress was in some television series including 'American Horror Story,'' The Strain' and more recently 'Falling Water.' These are talented artists were repeatedly proven that they are capable of far better performances than given here. It is usually best not to blame the material since many actors have done remarkable things with the flimsiest of scripts. Unfortunately, the disconnected narrative exhibited here ensures that an assembly of the greatest Shakespearean actors ever known to not have saved the production. On one of the most disappointing casting choices was to include Vincent D'Onofrio into this disaster. He has had many decades of being a deservedly well sought after character actor who has proven himself quite capable of handling the spectrum of leading roles. I'm confident that many people would rather watch Samara's cursed video and have to endure the hundred and two minutes of this flick.",

There's so much supernatural nonsense in this film, creating no tension or drama, and just being an excuse to use CGI to lazily circumvent practical effects. I found myself sighing in frustration most of the time, since banging doors, flashing lights and people popping up behind the characters are what passes for scares in this and countless other modern horror films. It's a dreary plot with substandard acting and a series of uninteresting developments, culminating with a ridiculous twist that dangles the carrot of potential continuation in front of the audience.

The acting was hit or miss - the main actor (Matilda Lutz) was not great, all of her dialogue felt very wooden. Her boyfriend played by Alex Roe was okay, although that has to be one of the dumbest characters in recent horror cinema given that it's his actions (or lack thereof) that allow certain things to happen plot-wise. I thought Johnny Galecki (Big Bang Theory) did well enough, although his character wasn't stunningly written, but for me it was Vicent D'Onofrio (Law and Order: Criminal Intent, Men in Black) who came in and rescued this movie from being a total wash. He is suitable for this kind of film and adds a much-needed layer to the middle and final portions. Even so, the lack of scares and chills, a mixed bag of performances with more misses than bulls-eyes and a frustrating plot make Rings a Dieharders Only experience. This is for diehard horror movie/Ring series fans and also for fans of Vincent D'Onofrio...so I'd probably watch this again? Maybe? Please don't believe me?",

Stylish direction and atmosphere are ok but  pointless, working to carry a story written by incompetents.   Stop messing with us, we SAW the 1rst 2 movies, remember? The premise of the 1rst tier is a good direction, the logical next step, but its unfulfilled and pierced by baffling plot holes to the point where it forgets itself, veering into a bad rehash that doesnt bring the mythos forward and messes with the timeline. On one hand this movie accknowledges the Ring two was ''thirteen years ago'' but now Evelyn dissapeared 30 years ago? Samara was born around 45 years ago.  Also Evelyn's ''dissapeareance'', considering we watchers know where she went, is a rather big detail to not mention. \n Here are a some more inconsistencies and blatant mistakes: \n- Why spend minutes 45 to 75 having the lead girl sleuthing for a mystery us watchers already know? Evelyn is Samara's mother, ok. Lets find the body thrice moved....In supernatural drama's those are terrible moves. \n- The priest is also played like a reveal although its more than obvious. And the lead girl, who smashed a church stain glass with no hesitation, once in a life threatening situation tries to OPEN a window?\n- Now the  teacher, who leaves a message about braille in Julia's hand but not the translation?! Prefering to drive for 4 hours instead of saying ONE word on an answering machine?  And with all his research, he never found out  who is Samara's mother, even knowing about the village where samaras body was transfered? This tape went around for 15 years and he never met Naomi Watts who was impossible to miss for anyone diggin into Samaras story, having smashed a goddam cabin AND found the body?? If Julia is the 12th person to come looking for Samara, And Evelyn was continually seeked out by people in her (unmentioned) asylum... Add it up; this is just beyond. \n- Also, a girl died and everyone dropped out of the ''science'' project; wouldnt it be the absolute contrary, given the very project they are working on!? And now its about proving life after death? That was the point of the quantum theory blah-ing?\n- Samara could burn to tape by heat impression, not digitalise, it makes the whole contemporary connection ludicrous! \n-  I really liked the plot of the ring two, it could have been a rich story to explore, with this dark water element, and they seemed headed there but  totally missed their mark with this pointless  search, ending  with... reincarnation? The snake eating the last ''tail''?  In the universe of The Ring, This is the opposite of otherworldly, making the mythos and the current story totally unrelated, with no justification for this pointless Julia girl to get this kind of connection with Samara. Also; i wish they had bothered looking for actors. Being pretty does not automatically come with acting skills. She is bad (but it doesnt help that the character is dull, one-dimensional and dumb).  \n\nSo its a bad movie because of horrible writing, like they never even re-read themselve before getting good means to shoot a badly mapped story.  How coked-up were those writers? Still i give it 2.5 instead of 1.5 because the apt directing manages to somehow make it a bit scary often enough, which is a good thing.",

Anyway the biggest problem with Rings is that it teases us with an actually very interesting premise and then abandons it.\n\nIt starts off like any horror film and then shows us some real promise for about ten minutes and then goes back to being overly generic. There is some really lazy writing here where a few twist events are only twists because instead of just telling our main character something in a second, they drag it out. \n\nFeaturing Johnny Galecki  playing a more age appropriate role than he plays on the positively irritating \"Big Bang Theory\" we even get Vincent D'Onofrio.\n\nIt is hard to say if we'll get another or if they'll just wait to reboot it again.

Rings follows Julia and her boyfriend Holt as they try to discover the secret behind the tape. It's a pretty hard plot to explain as it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but I'll do my best. So, Holt goes off to college. There he is introduced to the tape by his friend, Skye. Skye got introduced to the tape by her biology teacher, Gabriel. Gabriel is very obsessed with the tape and what it means. He's so obsessed he starts an underground club. He thinks the tape is an answer to one of the biggest questions; does a soul exist and where does it go after death? He conducts some experiments and finds out a very interesting thing. You can avoid dying in 7 days. When you're done watching the video, you make a copy of it and show it to somebody else. Then the person you showed it to is haunted by Samara instead of you. So, Julia sacrifices herself and watches the copy Holt made so he doesn't die. But, now Julia is in danger and in order to save her, the gang must find out the mystery behind Samara. That's, more or less, it. I really do appreciate the fact that they tried to expand on the mythology of the tape and do something different for this movie, even though it can get really silly. What I love the most about this movie is the direction. It's fairly well directed. I was surprised by how good the movie looked. The colours were very grim and creepy, and the overall creepy atmosphere was well achieved through those colours. The CGI wasn't the best, though. Samara looks alright, but the way she climbs out of the television looks incredibly cheap and took me out of the mood a little. Also, the \"Ring faces\" are quite ridiculous. \"Ring faces\" are the faces that people make when Samara gets to them. I didn't find the movie to be scary, but I did find it creepy due to the atmosphere and good direction. The acting was okay. My favourite performance is by Vincent D'Onofrio who plays a blind priest that shows up in the last 30 or so minutes of the movie. He's actually scarier than Samara, at least in this movie. The characters are nothing special. There's nothing memmorable about them. The ending I still don't know how to feel about. It leaves room for more sequels and is an intriguing end, but it just doesn't make any sense. All in all, Rings is an okay horror movie that is well directed and has interesting expansions on the Samara mythology, but is hard to make sense of. I would recommend this movie to the fans of the franchise.",

            "content": "Finally guys, a miracle has happened, we now have a 'The Ring' trilogy (American), i never thought the time would come, but now that it has we can celebrate. Samara Morgan is back after 12 years being forgotten and after seeing this film i can definitively say that.......... she should have stayed dead. It began with the Japanese film 'Ringu' in 1998 and this once interesting and terrifying plot has been driven into the ground. A girl climbing out of a TV screen can only be scary so many times people. This film follows a very familiar plot, Julia (Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz) watches the video and after finding out she will die in 7 days uncovers secrets about the tape that no-one else has ever seen and so she goes on a hunt to discover what really happened to Samara. The movie isn't 'the worst thing ever' and unbearable to watch as it does have a few moments that are quite scary and some other little story elements that are kinda ok. But despite its many efforts to change up the game you can't look at this and not recognise that at its core it is just a very tired premise. \n\nOne of the selling points of the film was that finally Samara was trading in that old VCR and maybe picking up a nice Blu-Ray Player instead, essentially moving over to more modern forms of media. This did leave some room for innovation but other than the opening scene from the trailer that takes place in the plane the new technological advancements don't really do anything strikingly new. Whether the video is being passed around as a tape or a digital file it doesn't really make a difference. There is a cool thing in the film that was actually pretty interesting and would have been a new way to approach a Ring film but the movie introduces and forgets about it all within a matter of about 3 minutes. So there is one part of the film where it looks like there is a secret organisation or more like a cult of people who know about the tape and try to work together to spread the video around to avoid people actually dying. This was a very cool premise that i reckon would have been a great way to change things up from the very simple formula being rehashed over and over again. So it's a shame this movie didn't take advantage of that and instead just played it way too safe. \n\nThe performances in the film don't help you get through it easily. The leads of the film Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz and Alex Roe were not good, like at all. A lot of their dialogue was very wooden, dry, and emotionless or they had lines that were just ridiculously overacted. There were a small handful of times where they sell the scares well but that's about it. I know Lutz comes from working on smaller foreign films and this is her first major American film from what i know so i guess i could give her a pass there. Johnny Galecki is fine in the film, probably one of the more engaging personalities in here, and they managed to drag Vincent D'Onofrio into this film, and he actually wasn't bad, there wasn't much to his character but he played it well.\n\nIn terms of the story there was always something i found fascinating about the mystery behind Samara and how and why she found herself killing people from within a VCR. That backstory has been covered pretty extensively in the previous films and as well as revisiting some of those plot points, this film does give a little more (newer) insight into her history which i thought was pretty engaging. Overall though the plot is a little all over the place focusing on a few different side-plots that throughout the 2nd and 3rd acts it tries to tie together and i guess does so but very thinly. So other than that and a handful of some pretty tense moments that get you throughout the film what else is there to this film? Not a whole lot really, but there is one Spoiler thing i will go into after my score.\n\nSo in the end, Rings tried to bring some life back into a forgotten franchise and other than a few brief moments of intrigue it very much failed to do so. Overall the story was scattered and reeked of missed opportunities, and the performances from the leads weren't doing anything to help the film. There are many better horror movies out there in 2017 so just go see anything else, but if you are still a die-hard fan of this franchise or B-grade (at best) horror films then you will get a kick out of this.\n\n4/10\n\nSo now there are SPOILERS TO FOLLOW, so DON'T read on if you have NOT seen the film as i will be spoiling the ending.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nSo in the end of the film you find something out that was already pretty much revealed in the trailer and that is that Samara ends up being reborn and taking over the body of Julia. She already took over a body in 'The Ring Two' but that was a very brief stint. What this does is surprisingly leave this franchise that should be long dead by now once again open for something new in a possible sequel. You could actually do an entire film where you have Samara terrorising people in a physical (living) form. This isn't anything worth getting excited over at all as the chance of this getting a sequel i don't believe would be very high but part of me wants to see what they could do with something like that.",

Lousy performances and nothing to comment and technically he sucks, even has a very well made sound mix, but it is practically what we can highlight, without any care in photography or track to create the tension of the film.

Also, some of the \"deaths\" in this movie play out like a Final Destination movie more than rings...so that was weird.  \nMuch like the Blair Witch movie, it presents a new angle to the mythology that we know from previous films but ends up ultimately making no sense in the end.

They are supposed to die in seven days from when they watched the video, unless they got a tail (someone who watched a copy of their movie clip and passes on the curse).\n\nBiggest plot hole for me is that it's really not that hard to get someone to watch a video. Some joker would have sent it to a thousand people after he watched it. If that happens, and it probably would have in the real world, would the ghost girl even have the attention span to haunt EVERYBODY? Not very realistic.\n\nThe story begins with the protagonist's boyfriend when he suddenly went into incommunicado, and she accidentally discovered the whole thing. When his time almost ran out, she watched the video to save him. For some reason, because she's the chosen one, her video contained extra footage. She used the clues from the video clip to find out what happened to the ghost girl.\n\nThe ending should have been at the bonfire. It would have gotten more stars.

            "content": "I'd like to think that I pay close enough attention to pop culture, specifically film, to know what is trendy and popular. I don't remember reading or hearing about a move to keep making additional entries in The Ring franchise. The first film was released in 2002 and was a remake of a Japanese film. It spawned a sequel in 2005, and somehow now we have a follow-up sequel. It isn't necessarily a reboot as it acknowledges there is a past to this story. If you remember, the premise involved a supernatural VHS tape that was cursed for whomever viewed it. After you watched the short video featuring a creepy girl named Samara who pops out of a well, you would get a phone call from an eerie voice stating you would die in seven days. Now that it's 2017, everything's gone digital. Johnny Galecki, best known for The Big Bang Theory, plays college professor Gabriel who buys a used VCR at some sort of rummage sale. It's not all that clear, but the sole reason why it's included is to give Gabriel a reason to come in contact with the tape. He attempts to get the VCR working and the video starts to play on all of his screens and devices. Try not to be too bored yet with this premise as it only gets worse.\n\nThe film cuts to Julia (Lutz) and Holt (Roe), a young couple passionately fooling around together on the last night before Holt has to head back to his college campus. Two horny teens are always featured in bad horror films. As the days pass on, Julia can't seem to get a hold of Holt. She gets bizarre messages from his frat mates and another female friend of his. A frustrated Julia heads to campus attempting to track Holt down. Her not-so-slick ways of getting to the bottom of it leads her to one of his classes where Gabriel just happens to be his instructor. What she comes to find out is that he is also the leader of this experimental secret society type group who is investigating the origin and aftermath effects of people who watch the tape. Julia finds Holt among the members of this group. After some painfully non-scary moments and stupid choices on her end, Julia winds up being another victim of Samara's video. The catch is that her video is longer and contains previously unseen footage. Again, try not to roll your eyes too hard yet at this premise. It's a race against the clock for Julia, Holt, and Gabriel try to track down Samara's origins in order to what? Save themselves? Save humanity? Lay Samara to rest?\n\nSo many questions rolled around in my head throughout Rings as a way to understand what was even happening before my eyes. Why are we getting a follow up to The Ring in 2017? Was there something new to be had with this franchise? The answer is no. Moving on. In order to set it in the current day they had to ditch the whole VHS concept and make it digital yet somehow the three person writing team felt the need to make Johnny Galecki's character, Gabriel, get into physical contact with the tape and a VCR. I'm assuming most of the teens seeing Rings will have no idea what a VCR is. Couldn't they simply have cut that and instead have him come in contact with a bootleg viral video that was popping up on the internet? My other question is why is Johnny Galecki in this movie to begin with? This is the kind of movie you make to get a paycheck. Galecki is one of the highest paid actors on TV thanks to his tenure on The Big Bang Theory. I can't imagine that he's that hard up for cash that he needs to star in Rings.\n\nThe whole plot device of having Gabriel working on some sort of experimental process involving Samara and the video isn't fully utilized. At one point, he mentions that each person has a tail that's following them. The idea of tails is not fully explained unless that's some description from the first film that I'm forgetting. Is the audience supposed to be kept in the dark about this? Apparently the writers don't care enough, because once Julia and Holt search out for Samara's origins the concept of the experiments and tails is completely forgotten about. It's as if Rings completely changes course for the second half of the movie. This leads to the other random casting in the film with Vincent D'Onofrio as Galen Burke. We're introduced to him as the crazy blind man in town who has a history with the village. Rings thinks it's being clever by involving a twist with his character, but it's completely unoriginal and uninspired.\n\nRings is a tragically unnecessary film that attempts to reboot a horror franchise when it wasn't needed. It is further proof that the horror genre is actually really hard to do well. We see feeble attempts like Rings all the time. F. Javier Guti\u00e9rrez fails at bringing any true scares to keep this film going. He goes so far as to try to make the opening of an umbrella scary, and it's laughable at best. Yes, you read that correctly. Umbrellas are made to be scary in Rings. That's the kind of movie this is.\n\nIs It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? It's safe to assume this will be on my worst of the year list.\n\nRATING: 1/2 out of 5 TICKET STUBS",

The only truly weak spot of the film is the wooden performance of the lead actress who plays Julia (Matilda Lutz).

Part of that is covered by the ending plot point but it felt like a cheap way to cover for a character whose delivery makes it hard to empathize with.

Why the movie couldn't have just opened at this point is beyond me, as the preceeding scenes aren't referenced, save it be for literally one line of dialogue. The director showed zero confidence in either the audience or his own skill for being able to portray subtle plot points. Key scenes aren't just shown, they are explained by the characters while they happen.The exposition was off the charts. Trapped inside this mess was Johnny Galecki who plays a young college professor. He actually brought weight and substance to his character. I found myself far more engaged during his scenes, but he's really just a side character. They dragged my man Vincent D'Onofrio into it as well. He did fine with his role, but the character felt like a last minute addition to the script to try to duct tape this plot together. The movie had an original release date of this past October, so I knew if the studio pushed a horror movie away from Halloween and stuffed it in early February it would be a rough ride. What it ended up being was a great idea for The Ring 4; rather than have the characters watch a creepy death movie, have them watch Rings.",

            "content": "From the \"why now?\" file, we have the third installment in a horror franchise that has been dormant since 2005. I haven't seen the first two movies since they first came out, but I remember thinking that The Ring is quite good. The Ring 2 is awful but is totally worth it for the deer attack scene, which is still one of the most unintentionally hilarious things ever put on film. Such vague memories are far more than what will stay with me about Rings, though. I was watching this movie 24 hours ago and I am already struggling to remember it. To summarize briefly: Rings is boring. It is painfully, mind-numbingly boring.\n \nIn a way, it makes a lot of sense to bring this series back now. With modern social media and the virality of media spreading online like wildfire, it would probably only take one jackass posting the Ring video online to wipe out half the world's population. Samara, our killer ghost, would have to hire assistants to help manage the sheer volume of murder appointments she would have on any given day. None of that matters, though, because this movie takes advantage of none of it. Johnny Galecki plays a college professor that is studying the ring video and using students as test subjects for documenting what happens after you watch the tape. Before a student's seven-day deadline arrives, another student will watch it to save the previous one, and so forth. This could actually be an interesting set-up, but the movie explains practically nothing about what he is doing. I spent as much time writing these sentences as the film does explaining what this dude is trying to do. As a quick aside, this guy's laboratory (I think) looks more like a freaking nightclub than a college facility, which loud music and multiple TVs and students seemingly just hanging out and partying. Speaking as a college administrator, somebody seriously needs to have a talk with this dude about proper usage of his funding.\n \nInstead of following that story, we get to follow some girl as our main character as she goes looking for her missing boyfriend, who is one of Galecki's students. I don't remember either of these character's names and the roles are performed with the enthusiasm of an insurance expo, so I'll just call them Girl and Guy. So, Girl sees a version of the video that is slightly different from the version everyone else sees, so they think she is special or something. Then Girl and Guy decide to go investigate the video's origins for some reason. After what feels like about 8 hours of them walking around and periodically finding a jump scare (including a quick shot to an umbrella opening, truly nightmarish stuff), Girl and Guy oddly stumble upon the plot of Don't Breathe in progress. Turns out that Samara's origin involves a blind, psychotic priest that impregnated a woman and then kept her chained up in the basement. And Samara is trying to be reincarnated in Girl's body.... I think. After a while, you forget that you're even watching a Ring movie because Samara shows up so rarely.\n \nI spent most of this film trying to make sense of the timeline. Assuming it is a sequel to the previous films, even though the events of those films aren't mentioned, much has happened since the CGI deer tried to inherit the earth in part 2. Samara's body was taken out of the well for some reason by somebody and then put into this town's cemetery. That caused a flood to destroy the town because....reasons. Then Don't Breathe priest guy took her body and stuck it in the wall of his house, again presumably for reasons. This all must have taken quite a long time and Samara has still clearly been active while all this happened, so she doesn't seem to care about any of it. By the end, I still hadn't made sense of it, but I think I devoted more time and thought to the subject than the writers did.\n\nI can't even muster the enthusiasm to be angry at this thing. It is inept in every way, from catatonic performances to cinematography that makes even daytime scenes look like they were shot underwater in the dark, but it isn't even a fun kind of bad. It's just a thing that played on a screen for what seemed like 12 hours while my mind darted from topic to topic, occasionally remembering that I was supposed to be watching a movie. Don't watch this movie unless you are having trouble sleeping, and even then I would recommend hitting yourself in the head with a hammer instead. At least then you would feel something.",

Not Hideo Nakata's original, Ringu, which I'm told is more horrifying than Gore Verbinski's US remake, thus putting me off watching the Japanese version all together. Admittedly too scared to on my own. \n\nThat screening had us knee-biting, face-hiding and under-the-breath swearing; walking back to my friend's flat to find the TV facing the wall with everyone else huddled on the sofas. To say we were all scared shitless was an understatement and it didn't help having a loner man come up behind us and whisper \"seven days\" as the end credits rolled. \n\nThe Ring legacy had already started out as a trilogy in Japan with a prequel, before Verbinski got his first Ring film complete. Nakata actually directing the US sequel Ring 2 that really wasn't a good follow up. I just remember it being a watered down version of it's previous film. \n\nThis instalment picks up 15 years later, where VHS is now an archaic relic. The legend of Samara continues, watching the surreal and disturbing short will bring about your death in seven days. (Who decides these rules? Does Samara keep a schedule?) But all of the original cast have been unexplainably replaced with new protagonists. \n\nLooks like Penny, Raj and Sheldon have finally dumped Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and moved on, leaving him to rot as an university professor who inadvertently comes across the film by purchasing VHS player with the video cassette still inside. Who would do that? Not Galecki because he wasn't to know, but who would leave the video cassette in there, letting it go to a vintage shop to be put back into circulation? Maybe Samara got to them, which leads me to a flaw in her quest to be heard. If she kills the one person who failed to pass on the viewing, it's game over for Samara. It's not like the video comes with any instructions to make copies and make it go viral. \n\nFairly inexperienced director F. Javier Guti\u00e9rrez takes the helm, with little to go on, it was possibly a gamble with the studios to have him direct. This being his first Hollywood feature after his Spanish film, Before The Fall. \n\nMatilda Anna Ingrid Lutz that's the lead as the key victim but comes across as quite the clingy psycho girlfriend who pretty much stalks her boyfriend, Holt (Alex Roe) when he goes A.W.O.L. from their nightly Skype and pretty much ignores her in a noble bid to spare her from what he's seen. \n\nNow I thought we already knew the back story, but no, they've added a twist to the tale, and Samara goes deeper than just being stuck in a well. And there's a terrible spoiler in the trailer, so don't watch it if you intend on watching soon. There's a moment it rips off a recent horror from last year, not a good move; and there's absolutely no lasting effect and maybe only a couple of jumps that fill the void of a mediocre, predictable plot. \n\nThe film is a prime example of what not to do, or of what people wouldn't, shouldn't do if ever in those eerie situations. No one in their sane mind would venture to a derelict church, in the dark, to search for something evil... Alone! However, it isn't scary enough. \n\nRunning Time: 2\nThe Cast: 2\nPerformance: 4\nDirection: 4\nStory: 3\nScript: 2\nCreativity: 6\nSoundtrack: 0\nJob Description: 1\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 0\n\n24% 2/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

Where to begin and where to end with this colossal pile of horse sh...\n\nOfficial Synopsis: A young woman finds herself on the receiving end of a terrifying curse that threatens to take her life in seven days.\n\n(Go see Sadako v Kayako instead)\n\nPlot: Boyfriend (Alex Roe) goes to college leaving girlfriend (Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz) home to care for her mom. Boyfriend does not answer a lot of texts, so girlfriend travels to his school and meets spooky teacher (Johnny Galecki) and mysterious blonde (Aimee Teegarden), neither of which just give her a direct answer leading her to find this odd cult world where college kids watch the \"death tape\" and then pass it along to a \"tail\" before their seven days are up creating a glitch in the Samora Kills You In Seven Days Matrix.\n\n(Go see Sadako v Kayako instead)\n\nGirlfriend finds boyfriend after mysterious blonde is killed by Samora, then she watches the tape to save him because his \"tail\" never shows up.\n\n(Go see Sadako v Kayako instead) \n\nGirlfriend is special, Samora remixes the tape giving her extra images to solve the mystery of Samora and give us all the backstory we have all been craving and begging for since The Ring debuted in America in 2002. \n\n(Go see Sadako v Kayako instead)\n\nEff this movie, here is what happens.\n\n(Go see Sadako v Kayako instead) \n\nGirlfriend finds a blind former preacher who gives her cryptic messages about Samora, then she finds a basement in the church that turns out to be exactly how it was decades ago when Samora's mom was kidnapped, held against her will, and gave birth to Samora. Get this, the mom was a young child when she was kidnapped and the police held an investigation for SIX EFFING MONTHS and could not find the basement filled with evidence that girlfriend found in a few hours. What the actual eff movie?!!?\n\n(Go see Sadako v Kayako instead)\n\nDo not see this movie, ever. Save your money. It is a steaming pile of horse shat.\n\n(Go see Sadako v Kayako instead)\n\nTake: You know how when you meet your heroes they never live up to the hype you built up in your head? Or, when someone explains something mysterious about what you love the explanation is never as satisfying as what you envisioned in your head? Insert Rings.\n\n(Go see Sadako v Kayako instead)\n\nOh, Rings is not funny.\n\nOh, and Rings disregards its own lore.\n\nOh, and and Rings is a lesser version at times of Final Destination, Don't Breathe, and other better movies. \n\n(Go see Sadako v Kayako instead)\n\nOkay, so we start on a plane all Final Destination style where a good looking young male actor Zach Roerig turns to a good looking young female actor Laura Wiggins and asks her, \"Do you know about the video tape that kills you after you watch it?\" Yeah, then all the Final Destination/Ring stuff happens and we go into the credits and then into the movie. \n\n(Go see Sadako v Kayako instead)\n\nYikes. If you have seen the movie \"Wild Tales\" you know that movie has one of the better openings of a movie in recent memory, it also so happens to be on a plane, and Rings went so far in the other direction with their cold open it knocked the damn ball off the pendulum. \n\n(Go see Sadako v Kayako instead)\n\nPositives. I like Amiee Teegarden from Friday Night Lights? That doesn't count. Um, it was only 107 minutes. That isn't a positive, horror movies should stay in the wheel house of 90 minutes or so. How about the acting made Twilight look Oscar worthy? Still not a positive. That is because this movie is the worst. No positives. Save your money. \n\nGo see Sadako vs. Kayako numerous times on Amazon or buy it to support quality movies worth your time and money.\n\n(Go see Sadako v Kayako instead)\n\nRecommendation: Well, I mean for the first 665 words I was so glowing and positive, right? I wasted 665 words of my life. Let's see. In theaters right now I would recommend La La Land, Arrival, Hidden Figures, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Split, Patriots Day, Lion Fences, 20th Century Women, The Comedian, xXx: The Return of Xander Cage, and why not the 25th Anniversary screenings of Wayne's Word while we are at it. I'd recommend all of those over Rings...\n\nSeriously eff this movie, I am generally a positive guy.",

This sequel follows in the same tradition but doesn't have the same effect as the first. It is still a good creepy time but doesn't have the same shock and fright factor of a truly great horror movie. Overall the story isn't bad but not strong enough to make it a movie you'll watch more then once. Johnny Galecki from Bing Bang Theory is an interesting risky choice but could have been casted better. As a horror fan it's always nice to see a kick back to a horror movie that changed our lives but 99% off the time it's going to fall short. If your looking for a truly sick  horror flick move on if your looking for an average horror movie with a few frights it's worth checking out. 2.5 fingers in the air!",

            "content": "Okay, Rings is their one mulligan, let's just hope that the horror genre starts following the the path of great flicks that 2016 brought us. To be honest, I never expected much going into this reboot/sequel, and I felt even less attachment to it after I left the theatre. This is yet another horror franchise that is far too afraid to stray from what made it good in the first place, that almost everything seems like a rehash. Sure, it's updated for today and when a VHS player is used, it's justified. I admire that this film tries to take the story in a different direction, but all of the big moments are really just recreations of the original films. Having said that, the portions of the film that are original, I found myself uninterested in. Here is why Rings was completely unnecessary and why I hope the franchise stops here. \n\nThere is only so much you can pull off with a premise like this, especially in today's day and age, due to the fact that everything is now digital. Opening with the most ridiculous sequence, taking away the thrill of only having one or two people viewing the tape, it felt like a roller coaster ride that shouldn't have been included in the film. Aside from that, there is an opening sequence just before the title card that had be intrigued. The tape is found after someone purchases an old VHS player at a flea market, which leads to a very eerie scene with some interesting visual effects. After that, the film very quickly dives into cliched characters and a plot that feels very heavy-handed. \n\nBuilding on the mythology as much as it possible can and having too many people exposed to this video all at once, Rings becomes confused with itself. A professor at a University holds a bunch of students in a room, searching for random people to put the curse on in order to continue the chain so nobody dies. Selling itself as a soft reboot for the franchise, this film also relies on you knowing certain elements from the previous films. The fact that you can copy the tape or in this case, the file, and hand it to someone else, creating an endless chain, is done throughout this film, but never explained. Only if you have seen the other films will you be able to fully comprehend the occurrences of this picture. \n\nThere hasn't been a film in this franchise since the release of The Ring Two back in 2005, and playing out as more of a sequel, the timeline needs to continue, incorporating today's technology. This is precisely where the film fails. Social media is at an all-time high right now, so anyone that sees this video would share it to their friends and it would become a global topic. Everyone on the planet would eventually die from this video. This premise doesn't work at all nowadays. If the studio was truly desperate to bring back The Ring, I would have suggested a remake that takes place about 20 years ago. \n\nIn the end, if you have seen any of the early entries in this franchise, nothing about this film should surprise you. Sure, it adds in a few new elements to keep things interesting, but Rings is poorly constructed and takes far too many turns with its plot to keep viewers fully engaged. Die hard horror fans may get a kick out of a few sequences, but Rings is all been-there-done-that in my opinion. I'm not a huge horror fan. I've said that many times and I will continue to say it, but Ringu and The Ring were great horror flicks that should have just stuck to those two films. For their time, they had an original premise that terrified audiences. Eventually, every single horror film will be reinvented and made into franchises if possible, and you know what? I'll never be against that, as long as a fresh premise is conjured up. Rings fails on everything it wants to be. There are some decent performances and some solid imagery, but this has been done much, much better in the past. I can't get myself to recommend it in any way.",

It actually has a good script and characters that have a little more depth then the usual horror fare that gets released, especially at this time of year. It further expands the mythos of Samara and the cursed tape and brings it to current time past the wretched vhs tape. It doesn't rely on cheap Jump scares and does offer some good creep value and legit eerie moments. \nIt does lack in the style that Gore Verbinski brought to the first one and the constant feeling of dread. There is a point where this does turn into final destination and the concept of seeing things happening before they do. While the original did have this, they used it more in a visual meaning rather than a cheap plot device.  Many things done in this one do work and are used creatively that merit this a good start point to bring a franchise. Hopefully we shall see.",

            "content": "SORRY, WRONG NUMBER - My Review of RINGS (0 Stars)\n\nFiling this squarely under \"Early In The Year Dumping Ground Movies Nobody Asked For\", RINGS plays out like the cynical cash grab as intended.  #Goals!!  \"FIRST YOU WATCH IT.  THEN YOU DIE\" reads the poster, but it should more accurately state, \"YOU WILL DIE WHILE WATCHING IT\".  \n\nFifteen years ago, Naomi Watts starred in the remake of the Japanese original, both considered classics of the horror genre.  I enjoyed them, along with RING TWO from 2005, but more for the visceral gooeyness on display rather than any great scares.  Featuring a cool concept of watching a creepy video and immediately receiving a phone call warning you that you'll die in seven days unless you can make a copy and get someone else to watch, the RING was the pyramid scheme of scare flicks.  IT FOLLOWS felt like their STD-riddled cousin.  RINGS, on the other hand, feels like their dead-on-arrival niece, thrice-removed.  \n\nMore of a reboot than a sequel, with perhaps a little more lore added to that mangy little Samara's storyline, RINGS features the same concept but pasted onto a bunch of horny college students.  Progress!!  Before the opening credits, we're treated to not one, but two ridiculous sequences.  One involves a scared man on a jet whose time to die fast approaches.  After a lot of shaky cam and sweating, we're cheated out of the money shot and abruptly cut to Johnny Galecki, who found time off from his BIG BANG THEORY schedule to slum it as a college professor who makes the mistake of watching that stupid Film School 101 tape.  Like all spineless teachers with tenure, he chooses to pass the curse along and endanger as many unsuspecting co-eds as possible.  \n\nOne of his victims happens to be Holt (Alex Roe), who just arrived at college, leaving his girlfriend Julia (Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz) behind to worry herself sick when he goes missing.  Lutz, who looks and acts like Phoebe Cates had she swallowed two fistfuls of Valium, tracks Holt down and, in an effort to save him, watches that damn video.  Millennials!  When will they learn that it's better to thin the herd by letting every one else die.  The ship has sailed long ago for taking one for the team!  \n\nFrom there, things play out fairly predictably, although in much more boring fashion than you would suspect. Director F. Javier Guti\u00e9rrez does the best he can in aping the original, and it's stylishly made.  Still, I'd call this a flaming turd, except flaming turds are fun to watch as they arc their way through the night sky, am I right?  RINGS is more like that hardened, dried-out piece of doggy do you find on your lawn seven days after it was laid to rest.  It's lost that steaming stench, no longer vital, and incapable of even sticking to your shoe.  I suppose if you've never seen the original films, you may have a creepy good time, but you will still wonder who that girl is crawling out of your television and why she doesn't have anything better to do!  You, of course, do.",

I actually enjoyed the mystery aspect of the film, but it kind of failed as a scary movie, as it wasn't scary at all and was filled with cheap fake jump scares. The acting from the two main people isn't bad, but you can tell they got the parts just because they were pretty. This movie seems much more of a sequel to the original movie The Ring, forgetting most of the nonsense from The Ring 2. Rings also seems to take more inspiration from the original Japanese films, where a lot more is learned about Samara's birth parents.\n\nFrom the trailers, I thought that this movie might have a lot more stuff with social media, but other than a few things, this movie could have taken place a decade ago. The only thing to show that the film's in the present is that they copy & paste video files, and they use smart phones as flashlights. Overall, the film isn't horrible, but it also isn't very good, I definitely wouldn't recommend it.\n\nIf you want to see my full review in video form you can check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JstAEbfzXwI",

            "content": "You may be aware that the release of 2017's \"Rings\" (PG-13, 1:57) came a dozen years after the previous American sequel in the \"Ring\" franchise, or even that the very first \"Ring\" film was Japanese, but most people aren't aware of how the story began and how far-reaching it has become. The story of people dying seven days after watching the strange images on a mysterious videotape was first told in a trilogy of books by Japanese author Koji Suzuki in the 1990s. The first novel in \"The Ring Trilogy\" was simply titled \"Rings\" and was published in 1991. In Japan, it inspired two manga adaptations, a 1995 film (\"Ring: Kanzenban\"), a TV series (\"Ring: The Final Chapter\"), another movie version (1998's \"Ring\", also known as \"Ringu\") and a sequel (1999's \"Ringu 2\"), followed by two remakes of the 1998 film, one from South Korea (\"The Ring Virus\" in 1999) and the other from the U.S. (\"The Ring\" in 2002). The American version made over five times what it cost so, naturally, there was a sequel. The profits for \"The Ring Two\" (released in 2005) \"only\" tripled its budget and was also rated much lower than the previous film by both critics and audiences. The success of \"The Ring\" led to the American remakes of other Japanese horror films such as \"The Grudge\" (and its sequel), \"Dark Water\" and \"Pulse\", but the diminishing \"Ring\" returns and reviews probably contributed to the 12 year gap between \"The Ring Two\" and \"Rings\".  \n\nUpdating the story for a new decade means that, rather on VHS tape, the deadly video at the center of the story is now being stored as a digital file and is viewable on a variety of devices, making the clip all the more ubiquitous - and dangerous. Remaining the same, however, is the origin of the video (a murdered girl named Samara reaching out for vengeance from beyond the grave) plus the way in which the video's curse is carried forward (the viewer receiving a phone call with a creepy female voice on the other end seeing strange things that are not there and then dying exactly seven days after watching the video, unless he or she copies the video and dupes some other poor schmuck into watching it before the week is out). We see the culmination of this pattern play out in the first scene on an airplane flight during which a handsome young man explains his nervousness to an incredulous female passenger by explaining, just as the plane is about to land, that he only has to \"make it\" through a few more minutes.\n\nJulia and Holt (Matilda Lutz and Alex Roe) are just two teenagers in love... who are about to find themselves deep in a well of malevolence. Holt is heading off to college, while Julia stays back in their hometown to take care of her ailing mother. Texts, phone calls and Skype sessions keep the relationship going... until Holt suddenly and inexplicably stops answering Julia's calls. Desperate, Julia jumps in her car and drives to Holt's college where he is nowhere to be found and where those who know him either don't know where he is or won't say. Julia knows that Holt has been getting extra credit by working on a project for Gabriel, his biology professor (Johnny Galecki), but the prof denies knowing who Holt is, so Julia follows him to another floor of the classroom building to see what's up. She finds herself in a room full of students, video screens and digital clocks which are labeled with various students' names and which are counting down from various points in time. Julia follows a panicked student named Skye (Aimee Teegarden). Skye admits that she knows where Holt is but, before explaining further says, \"I have to show you something first\". Skye takes Julia home and Julia sees texts from Holt on Skye's phone. \nJulia learns about the cursed video and that Holt watched it - almost exactly seven full days earlier - so she watches it in order to save Holt, which starts her own proverbial clock ticking. But the video Julia sees is a little different from the previous versions. There are even more disturbing, surreal and seemingly random images in Julia's video - and her experience is different from everyone else's. With Holt's help, Julia follows the clues in her video and the visions that she starts seeing so she can unravel the mystery, save her own life and maybe finally give Samara's spirit some peace. This quest ends up in a small town, where they meet a secretive B&B owner (Jill Jane Clements) and the caretaker (Vincent D'Onofrio) of the grounds of a former church, as they learn of the disappearance of another young girl 30 years earlier, all of which adds background to the version of this saga that began in \"The Ring\". \n\n\"Rings\" is both enjoyable and frustrating. Updating the technology involved with watching, copying and sharing the infamous Samara video opens up more possibilities for story-telling, while delving deeper into Samara's sad history adds interesting background - and also takes the tale of the tape in some cool new directions. On the other hand, the script's lack of exposition makes the movie hard to follow... and the acting is somewhat lacking. The ending brings most of it together well, but getting there will put you through the... wringer. \"B\"",

I haven't made a single Best Horror Films list in which The Ring hasn't been in my top 5. I adore it. I even enjoyed its ridiculously outlandish sequel, because come on, Naomi Watts SOLD THOSE FILMS. That being said, RINGS is a massive slap in the face to the franchise. What a complete and utter joke. From its god-awful opening segment to its cringe-worthy final shot, RINGS is a mess from beginning to end. It plays out like b-horror, and a low-budget less-than-mediocre one at that. I honestly cannot fathom how the special effects/CGI and make-up in this film are incredibly worse than the original film from 14 years ago (in which they were truly terrifying). I'm struggling finding a single thing I enjoyed about this film. The leads were atrociously bland, the plot points were borrowed entirely from the original and executed in an awful manner, and it completely butchered the mythology of The Ring without explanation. I suppose it was mildly pleasant hearing the same score from the original, along with the same iconic videotape and clips of Samara Morgan as a child. Still, RINGS brought nothing worthwhile to the table. Filled with continuously unnecessary jump-scares while building no suspense or atmosphere, RINGS is a disgrace of a film and without a doubt one of the worst excuses for horror I have ever seen.",

I didn't find this creepy at all. It was more just of a mystery to me, which wasn't bad a thing. I just wish they would have executed the plot a little more. I feel that for a 2 hour movie, nothing substantial really happened. I will say the one thing that kept me intrigued was the acting, the main leads were good and the support cast in my opinion was great. Vincent nailed his roll and Johnny Gallecki played his role great and was my favorite character due to this.",

            "content": "\"Some old videotapes should've been better off left on the shelf\"\nMovie Review: Rings\nDate Viewed: February 9 2017\nDirected By F. Javier Gutierrez\nScreenplay By David Loucka, Jacob Aaron Estes and Akiva Goldsman, Story By David Loucka and Jacob Aaron Estes, Based on the 1998 horror film \"Ring\" from Hideo Nakata\nStarring: Matilda Lutz, Alex Roe, Johnny Galecki, Vincent D'Onofrio, Bonnie Morgan, Aimee Teegarden, Chuck David Willis, Patrick R. Walker, Zachary Roerig, Laura Wiggins, Lizzie Brochere, Karen Cessay, Dave Blamy, Michael E. Sanders, Randall Taylor, Drew Grey, Kayli Carter, Jill Jane Clements, Ricky Muse and Jeremy Harrison.\n\nThis movie never crosses the fiery circus ring at all. \"Rings\" is a wholly unnecessary follow-up to the 2002 hit horror film \"The Ring\". The first movie and the original 1998 Japanese film both centered around a cursed videotape that kills people in seven days after they've watched the tape. Director Gore Verbinski and Naomi Watts are nowhere to be found in this new movie but hey! we got Vincent D'Onofrio and Dr. Leonard Hofstadter from \"The Big Bang Theory\"! May I demand a refund?\n\n\"Rings\" is not only a half-assed sequel with slick production values and without any members from the original cast or crew, it also has one major problem. How can the cursed videotape kill people when nobody is using VHS anymore? Wait a minute? Now the cursed tape kills people by simply transferring into the digital age? \"Rings\" doesn't explore that aspect at all and it simply makes no sense whatsoever. The tagline for the poster says, \"First You Watch It, Then You Die\". How about if you don't watch this movie because it feels like the son of an old tape to the son of an old tape to another son of an old tape and.... you get the idea.\n\nThis sequel or reboot or whatever you call it follows a bad dude named Holt (Alex Roe) who's about to head off for college leaving his beautiful girlfriend, Julia (Matilda Lutz) behind. She starts to grow concerned for Holt after she loses contact with him. Suddenly in her computer blog, she sees a panicked girl who asks about Holt's whereabouts and then the screen turns blank.\n\nGetting increasingly worried, Julia travels to Holt's college campus where she encounters a professor named Gabriel Brown (Johnny Galecki). She follows him to a private area of the college where a cult group known as \"The Sevens\" are involved in an experiment that involves the same cursed videotape from the first two American \"Ring\" movies.\n\nThen Julia sees the same woman she saw on her computer and she takes her into her room to watch the video. Julia locks herself in the bathroom and the woman who is named Skye (Aimee Teegarden) gets murdered by the lanky-haired young girl known as Samara Morgan (Bonnie Morgan). Eventually Julia does find Holt and she's not willing to let him go out of her sights again. When Julia moronically does watch the video, she gets a burnt mark on her hand and that means more bad news for her and Holt. Vincent D'Onofrio co-stars as a blind cemetery caretaker who may or may not have a connection to Samara and his talents are completely wasted here.\n\nSpanish director F. Javier Gutierrez has vacuum cleaned all the good scares from \"The Ring\" and he sucks out cheap jump-scares and horror movie cliches. The performances are awful, the plot is pure nonsense and the screenplay by David Loucka (Dream House and House at the End of the Street), Jacob Aaron Estes (Mean Creek and The Details) and Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind, A Time to Kill, The Da Vinci Code, Batman & Robin, Lost in Space, Winter's Tale) is more unstructured and convoluted than scary.\n\nThe 2002 original \"Ring\" may have been a huge hit but it led to more silly J-horror remakes like \"The Grudge\", \"Shutter\", \"One Missed Call\" and \"Mirrors\". Thankfully they all stopped and horror movies have gotten a lot better over the past few years thanks to \"The Conjuring\" movies, \"Don't Breathe\", \"The Babadook\", \"The Cabin in the Woods\" and so forth. Some old videotapes should've been better off left on the shelf and \"Rings\" is no exception.",

I have never found (2002) The Ring or The Ring Two scary or could not have figure out what was so shocking about a supernatural girl known as Samara coming out of the tv screen to kill her victims. I was hoping Rings would be able to improve on delivering some thrills and scares. Sadly, Rings is the worst out of the three. If your looking for something new than its clearly not this film which follows the redundant plot like the previous two films. \n\nThe film follows Julia (Matilda Lutz) after not hearing from her boyfriend Holt (Alex Roe) for a long period of time when he is away at college. She tries to find him and only discover that his biology professor Gabriel (Johnny Galecki) has found a VHS tape that after viewing. You have seven days before you die. Only Gabriel has several followers of a group that has discovered and viewed the video. They were able to figure out a solution on surviving this week of terror. Julia and Holt are trying to discover the origins of Samara and trying to set her free from this curse. \n\nSome new concepts like one of the professors Gabriel has an experiment study group that are focused on the video and figuring out solutions on how to survive the week. Especially, how technology has changed over the years. When the original movie focused on that VHS tape that kills. Now, it's a video that is streaming online or by a link sent to your email. Which can cause mayhem when many people receive a link from someone they know.  \n\nRings is a terrible supernatural horror film that is not any better than its predecessors. The plot is redundant in a formulaic concept. Julia learns about the deadly video, wants to learn and discover about Samara. And figure out a way to stop her from harming others. Its something we seen in the previous films. Except this time around, we see that disturbing video over and over again which becomes annoying. Rings was not as scary or thrilling. It was really boring, even though we learn a little bit more about Samara's disturbing past. It did not help make the movie any better. \n\nEveryone of the casts performance was dull and forgettable. Even Vincent D'Onofrio acting was cheesy. Director F. Javier Gutierrez tried to create that eerie atmosphere using flashing camera shots. But the previous films worked a lot better in that creepy tone. The plot twist was not as surprising; it was hard to be engaged to its tedious story. \"I want to see it through,\" as Julia tells Holt about trying to learn about Samara. This is definitely one of those horror films that it is not worth sitting to see it through. It was dull, lacked in scares and thrills, and a tired plot that does not work the third time around.",

That said, it has no depth, the characters aren't really likeable except Johnny Galeki (and that might just be because I love Leonard).  The ending has no real surprise either and you can see it coming. It's saving grace for me is the updated video tape, pretty cool to see new scenes being added.",

KILL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE PLANE \n1. They didn't watch the Tape\n2. If they did watch the tape why wouldn't they get 7 Days ???? Just little thing like that make no damn sense\n\nThe Visuals of Samara  look terrible while the 2002 American original looks 100x better than 2017\n\nThe first on screen kill Girl was pretty bad \n\nThey gave Samara a new Origin.......... Ugh\n\nThe Ending is so Retarded\n\nOverall: Even with it being boring I was still OK with this movie then the ending killed it\n\nOverall Grade: D-",

A somewhat sequel to The Ring (2002) & The Ring Two (2005) this film follows a young lady named Julia (Matilda Lutz) who is concerned after her boyfriend Holt (Alex Roe) doesn't respond to her after going away to college. End of the movie....I wish. Anyways Julia goes after Holt who mysteriously has joined up in a research group ran by his professor Gabriel (Johnny Galecki). The group watched The Ring video which in their case forces them to share the video to someone else who hasn't seen it, or they die in 7 days. Julia watched the video of course, but a different version plays for her leading to Holt and her researching more about the girl in the video Samara (Bonnie Morgan) it eventually leads them to a town called Sacrament Valley (yup swear to God) where they uncover more secrets of Samara's past. The film comes to us 12 years after the last movie and man it just should not have come out. It isn't scary at all and the whole concept is extremely dated regardless of changing the video type to a \"viral video\" now. Samara just doesn't compete with the real scares of the world I guess. Also none of the characters are likeable. The only person I even remotely enjoyed was an old crazy dude named Burke played by Vincent D'Onofrio. The film has some cringe worthy dialogue as well and even with 20 minutes left of the film I felt like there was absolutely no plot that moved any kind of action. The film has a slight \"twist\" at the end, but it doesn't matter because the movies terrible. Avoid this one and just rewatch the original remake from 2005 again if you want a good horror film.",

Rings is not all bad, but you absolutely have to look at it apart from the Ring franchise and think of it as its own, non-Rings entity.  As part of the (American) trilogy, it's terrible; it takes away all that the incredible first installment set in motion, and is lesser than even the just decent second installment; it completely changes the story (to something too technologically updated [spoiler-ish], The Samara Project?  Really?  That's where you take it?).  Now, besides this update, you actually do get a good enough story.  Similar in following the clues to decipher Samara's code as in the first Ring films, you get some additional tidbits into the story (Samara's family and townfolk).  These were actually good scenes that THANKFULLY stray from the [spoiler again] Samara Project hogwash.  Oh, and no more than three minutes into the movie, you (or at least I did) see editing discrepancies.  The man did not tell the girl that his phone call simply uttered \"7 Days.\"  He said something to the effect that his phone call said he will die in 7 days.  And when she tells her friend about the strange man, she says that he said his phone caller said, in Ring-fashion and Samara voice, \"7 Days.\"  Sorry, nitpicking, but it was already off to a bad start.  Kudos, though, to Vincent D' Onofrio, who turns in a terrific performance.",
