Ryan Gosling portrays K very well, slowly progressing from a stone-cold killer to a more unstable man questioning his entire reality. Harrison Ford still has  great charisma in this film, and you can clearly tell that he was excited to return to his character once more, unlike in The Force Awakens.",

A gorgeously crafted movie that has pioneered the conventions of cinematography accompanied by its immsersive and droning soundscape, thereby successfully reserving its spot in the pantheon of groundbreaking films. The brutalist architecture, overwhelming landscapes that swallow characters, contrasting color palettes like drowning irradiated Los Angelinos in a bright orange hue, these define the film and qualify it as an everlasting experience through a myriad of visual beauty. However, the story is dragged out and can seem overly long, but each shot is masterfully carried out, and that deserves the viewing and praise. I am forever perplexed how this marvel flunked at the box office. Its soundscape and cinematography surely were elevated in the experience.",

At nearly 3 hours long, you're taken on a lengthy investigation to discover the origins of said secret, yet the movie keeps you engaged and interested through its entire runtime. The cast all deliver great performances, specifically Gosling and Jared Leto (who plays, you guessed it, a creepy guy). The stunning scenery and set design fully immerse you in this futuristic world, and the music perfectly complements every scene it's utilized in. This film also has some of the best cinematography I've ever seen, and from a visual standpoint, is truly a work of art. While I'm admittedly not a fan of the original, I enjoyed this sequel much more. A riveting sci-fi mystery (you could even call it a detective story) with some gorgeous camerawork and an unexpected twist or two, \u2018Blade Runner 2049' is more than worth your time and will linger in your mind long after the credits roll. \n(Side note: I would recommend watching the original first, as you'll probably understand and enjoy this one more.)",

The movie goes through so many highs and lows for our main character while telling a beautifully crafted story. The movie has themes that are eerily similar to what people can experience in real life. Like the feelings of searching for a purpose, truly feeling alone, struggling to know what to believe in, feeling like a slave, being trapped, losing a loved one, and feeling like your life is meaningless. I know a lot of movies can show these emotions and feelings, but the way this movie goes about it is special. I also think this is Ryan Gosling best work I have seen. The way he portrays this character really makes you really feel connected with him and his journey. He also somehow brings this emptiness and sadness that I have never seen in a character. The movie is also a cinematography masterpiece. It has beautiful and breathtaking visuals with equally dark and scary visuals. You really feel like this dystopian future is really not that far fetched and you could be looking at it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is struggling with trauma or depression. You can really relate to this movie which can help cope with those emotions but it also could be a trigger. This movie does have a heavy emotional impact. I would also recommend this movie to anyone else over 18+. There is some hard concept to grasp and a fair amount of gore, violence, and nudity. After watching this film for the first time I knew it was already one of my favorite films. I would highly recommend giving it a watch.",

The world building is immaculate, full of true wonder, and keeps you under its spell all the way to the very end. In some ways, it even surpasses the original.\n\nThe story is a methodically structured puzzle, solved through slow but persistent drips of revelation. The director, Denis Villeneuve, achieves a cerebral and even touching picture, while also accomplishing an uncommonly sublime production, marks Blade Runner 2049 as a landmark in the science-fiction genre.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this film to all hedy science-fiction fans, as it is a new chapter, a triumph, and a cinematic miracle. A must-watch for any cinephile.",

Harrison Ford, Ryan Gosling, Ana De Armas, and everyone else give incredible performances. I do believe the plot is a bit hard to follow and is filled with messages. I definitely need to give this a rewatch to fully understand everything going on. Regardless, despite not understanding fully what's going on, this was a masterpiece in filmmaking.

The protagonist in Blade Runner 2049 Agent K is like the protagonist in Blade Runner Rick Deckard. He gets frustrated a lot because it's difficult for him to solve a puzzle as a cop. The character Luv in Blade Runner 2049 is like the character Roy because she wants to be more human, only she tries to achieve her goal by doing evil. \nThe world created in Blade Runner 2049 is fascinating because, like the first Blade Runner it's always night and raining. The director has his own style by making it a world that's snowy and cloudy as well. Most of the action takes place indoors or outdoors of the futuristic world. There's action when the bad guys capture Rick, when Agent K finds him in a city or town. Lighting is used to highlight the action.  For example, an orange lighting is seen when he finds Rick.   It is revealed that for all these years Rick has been spending time in an abandoned casino.\n\tThe casino looks very futuristic and techno like. It shows holograms of Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, and Marilyn Monroe. The holograms appear in a place that looks like a bar and another place that looks like a restaurant. The holograms make sounds which is a little disturbing and this happens when K and Rick are fighting.\n\tBlade Runner 2049 is worth seeing because it's brilliant with its visuals and script.",

I found myself rewinding scenes just take it all in. I wonder what master pieces we would have if Mr. Villeneuve was allowed to touch Star Wars or Star Trek. If this movie was longer I would still watch it. It is one of those movies you do not want to end because you are absorbed by it and are submerged in its creative universe. The acting was perfect, casting was perfect, dialogue on point, scenes and cgi were perfection and action sequences leaves you at the edge of your seat and finally the story telling was delicious.

But it may also be one of the film's biggest strengths as it decides to owe nothing to anything but itself and its predecessor, resulting in a confident, singular vision.

The secret of the naturally born replicant unveils smoothly. As the audience follows Officer K, they learn the different facts about the case. When they reach the end, the parts of the case merge to deliver a plot twist that will leave the audience speechless. The plot of Blade Runner 2049 is story writing at its finest. \nThe film will not only entertain the audience, but it will also make them think and feel.

Where do you draw the line? This movie leaves you thinking for days and weeks after. If you haven't read the book \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" or seen the first movie, you may need to read up on some background after. But I think this movie is enjoyable even without understanding the background. My only regret is that I didn't see the movie in theaters. The only big turnoffs I can point out to potential viewers are the length and the fact the movie is a bit of a slow burn.

No one.), a protagonist that ends up not mattering one whit, a silly \"plot twist/shocking reveal\" focused story that significantly reduces any re-watchability, a relationship story in Joi and K that's just zeroed out suddenly in such a way that clearly demonstrates that it wasn't very important (yet somehow took up a vast amount of screen time early in the film), a soundtrack that was perfectly OK Hans Zimmer but had only one recognizable song, one moment where the audience felt it and THAT one part was from the original movie's Vangelis soundtrack. People certainly won't be listening to this generic Zimmer score 30 years from now like they still listen to Vangelis original Blade Runner soundtrack.\n\nAnd the additional frustration of being told \"you just don't get it\" and \"oh, you're part of the attention deficit audience problem\".  No, I got it fine, it's not exactly Fellini.

Its obviously one of those films that leaves you wondering what is 'real' and what isn't. I thought the incidental music played lightly in the background was quite effective. It was nice seeing the flying cars again, as featured in the original film. I'm not sure if I ever really believe society could end up quite how its portrayed in films such as these, as soon as by 2049 but who knows?. This film certainly has a mysterious feel to it and decent performances from Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford. I felt it had a similar 'feel' to it as the Matrix films - I suppose the obvious similarities being that their science fiction films based in mainly CGI generated landscapes etc. It also made me think of the more recent Ghost in the Shell film with Scarlet Johansson.\n\nThis is certainly a decent sequel and so its worth a watch, yes - mainly if your comfortable with many scenes featuring little in the way of dialogue. The bright lighting/colours used emphasised the other-worldly or otherwise artificial nature of the settings featured.",

If the 1982 film was philosophical, this one is PHILOSOPHICAL with capital letters and maybe bold. While in that film we followed a journey of self-discovery of a supporting character, here we follow the protagonist's journey of self-discovery; he's actually solving two cases: the case that the LAPD assigned him (the external one) and the subsequent case that a piece of evidence put on his \"mind\" (the internal one). 30 years have been passed, it was incredible to see how the world has evolved and how the replicants have evolved; the dynamic between humans and replicants are completely different now, which impeded the screenwriters (the same of the 1982 film) to tell the same type of story. It's still an action/sci-fi movie, but they knew what made \"Blade Runner\" so special and invested in that sector. Ryan Gosling is perfect as K: inexpressive on the outside (he's a replicant after all), but as the film progresses, his emotions start to be de-bottled. Harrison Ford is a legendary actor and Rick Deckard is possibly his third most famous character, only behind Han Solo and Indiana Jones; Deckard's cold personality is maintained here, and Gosling proved how good he is by not being obfuscated by Ford's presence. Ana de Armas' character is by far the most intriguing: she, in personality, looks like Karen (Plankton's computer wife from \"SpongeBob: SquarePants\") but with a human body, and she's possibly the pivot of K's internal journey (alongside Mackenzie Davis). Dave Bautista and Jared Leto have little screen time but their characters aren't forgettable, Sylvia Hoeks is a cool and dangerous antagonist, and Robin Wright remembered me of Judi Dench's M from Daniel Craig's 007 franchise. The cinematography, soundtrack and sound work are DAZZLING; this movie is definitely a sensory experience, and I'm really jealous of those who watched this masterpiece in a movie theatre. Oh, and I still keep with my theory that Rick Deckard is a human.",

This franchise has by far the most intriguing backdrop of any movie I've ever seen and watching more plots unfold in it will be a joy if they go forward with their TV show or more movies. I feel especially sure of that because of how uninteresting I found this particular plot to be, a similar feeling I had to the first one. The incredible sense of magnitude and hidden depths and mystery that their impeccable setting offers led me to appreciate even less how ultra-low the plot's stakes were. I didn't agree that killing the replicants was necessary in the first place (at least in the context of the movie; I'm aware the novel is different) and tracking down the kid was just not a riveting premise for me. My opinion was reduced even further when they directly tied Deckard into it instead of just having him show up to help as it implies that in all of the gigantic cityscape the only two interesting things to have ever happened involved him. As with the first movie I feel I would appreciate this (which essentially serves as a requel) more if it began a franchise where better stories are told in the same universe.",

Firstly, Roger Deakins was very much deserving of the Oscar he won for cinematography. Each shot is museum worthy. And Villeneuve and the rest of the creative team brought to life again this dystopic vision of a cyberpunk future LA, and it remains enchanting. I also love the route they take with this story, centering on a Blade Runner who knows he is a replicant instead of rehashing the is-he-or-isn't-he question of Deckard from the first one. K's arc of slowly starting to believe that he is special only to find out that, in that one specific way, he is not was satisfyingly subversive. The parallelism of Luv, a replicant who also sees herself as special, is a great choice as well. Joi is another character that invites analysis, since we have to consider (as K does) if she was merely following her obvious AI programming to make K feel better or if she was able to reach some level of being a \"real girl.\" As with the original, it is a slow movie that really demands your attention. And as with the original, I feel this is a film that requires multiple viewings to truly have seen it. For now, 4.5 wooden horses (which was at the center of a great mystery in this story)",

It created great new characters, which we were able to connect with, and was able to bring elements from the past with sublteness and intelligence.\n\nIt takes it's time and it's the opposite of the majority of the modern Sci-Fi movies. Its pace paired with the astounishing shots and the groundbreaking score allows us to connect with everything in this universe, it captures us and makes us prisioners of that world for the runtime of 2 hours and 44 minutes.\n\nThe story unrolls in quite an unique way, it's like every inch of dialogue matters and you really don't want to miss anything, just for the pleasure of connecting the dots and being able to feel everything. I wasn't expecting to be hit in such an emotional level.\n\nRyan Gosling was definitly the best casting choice. He absolutely nailed the role. Ana de Armas was also amazing and portrayed the role of the A.I. Cyberpunk girlfriend with ease. Harisson as always was a fucking badass. Carla Juri with little screentime was able to do a really great job portraying Rachael and Rick's long lost daughter.\n\nThis is one of the most beautifully shot movies I've seen, every look, every landscape, every face, every shot felt like it should be there and carried a lot with it. Loneliness and the sense of getting lost have never been so well portrayed in a Sci-Fi movie.\n\nThis is everything modern Sci-Fi movies should be.\n\nThank you Denis for making this Masterpiece, thank you Ridley for creating this world. Would give everything to be able to watch this on the big screen.",

Although Scott's film had these in his it served to create a\nbelievable, if alien, and atmospheric world. In this one it just served\nto give the appearance of trying to convince idiotic Americans that\nsomething significant or profound was going on. If an intelligent man\nsaid they found this stylisation an original and artistic creation I\nwould believe him but for me, it was not that.\n\nThe characters too were often paper thin - the protagonist, with\ndesigner stubble and bomber jacket come trenchcoat, being played as hard\nboiled when he was obviously the prettiest boy in school, the hard\nhitting ageing blond tom boy boss with greased back hair who swore a lot\nand acted mean but in the end died for her employee, the sexy but deadly\nevil assassin in tight trousers, the weird psycho in some bizarre\nfuturistic version of a lonely mansion having no idea what a fruitloop\nhe is whilst seemingly performing some of the world's most complex\nscientific tasks with nothing more than a giant plastic bag, some slime\nand a floating camera for tools - all a little bit cliche for me.\n\nThe dialogue didn't do any better which at it's absolute best was\nsickeningly pseudo-philosophical with fake insight and dubious value.\n\nThat being said I did start to warm to the film a little, or perhaps\njust got used to it, then they brought in Harry. It felt a little like\nLuke Skywalker in the new Star Wars - these youngsters, actors and\ndirectors, need to bring in the old hands to give what they are doing\nsome depth, what are they going to do when there are no more old hands?\nBut Harry did bring a little depth, but not enough and he could not\nredeem the film.\n\nThe whole thing seemed like something that was created deliberately to\nmake money or make an impression but there seemed very little\noriginality or creativity in it, like a man making an unusual looking\ncake but underneath is just a sponge to a tried and tested recipe, it\ndid not feel like an artist's individual and personal expression.\nPerhaps it is the cinema version of contemporary art - pointless.\n\nI have come down harsh and perhaps there were some good things about\nthis film. Although like usual far too much CGI ruined the visual\nappearance and experience as a whole but it was moderately pretty in\nplaces. I imagine the Yanks will love it, but in the end, like so many\nfilms before, they should have just left Blade Runner alone.",

So this time I watch the 1984 final cut first. Honestly, except the last monologue, I thought that first movie was a snooze fest. 2049 improved a lot more than the 1984, but still I thought the pacing was a bit too slow. \n\nWhat's significantly better was the story, which was more intense and harder to predict than the first. There was also more characterization to the main blade runner, played by the subdued Ryan Gosling. He had to figure out his past, and the twists and turns made his journey much more interesting than Deckard in the 1984 movie. \n\nThe cinematography was undeniably top-notch. Almost every shot was breathtaking and gorgeous. Ana de Armas looked out of this world, just like she was in No Time to Die.\n\nOverall, I wasn't entirely onboard with the story, but I definitely enjoyed the beautiful look of the dystopian world. 8/10",

This movie might equalized the first position. I'm not ready to say that it surpassed Interstellar visually but it is very close.\n\nCompared to its predecessor, Blade Runner 2049 is a slight better. I know that in my review of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner I said that the movie was for me unclearly a masterpiece. I didn't really know what to think about it after seeing it but during the whole month I backed up a bit and realized the original was a tremendous masterpiece that I must rewatch. Which I will do soon. It was really innovative for the time it was made. It was perfect. The plot was simple but perfect. Vangelis' soundtrack and the cinematography too. And the final speech by Roy was so damn good. The philosophical questions this movie brings are so deep and I think about it a lot. But, what I want to say is that 2049 does almost the same thing as Blade Runner but maybe even better. It is a philosophical film about how humans and A.i live together so normally that at a certain point, humanity will be no longer the \"normal\" breed that is accompanied by a captivating directing and soundtrack. It is an immersive experience that you need to live. The only problem of this sequel is that I felt a bit lost about the plot. At some point you're like \"but what is going on?\" , but you figure it out.\n\nWonderful piece of art.",

Roger Deakins' cinematography is a joy to behold, utterly captivating, and finally won him an Oscar at 467th attempt. Denis Villeneuve continues to craft brilliant film after brilliant film, and if his previous output is anything to go by, we should all be very excited about his vision of Dune, which is still currently slated for a Christmas release. No-one had any right to make a sequel to Blade Runner, but Villeneuve somehow takes the gauntlet and runs with it, managing to keep all the unanswered brain twisters still left to your own interpretations, and the way he keeps the story alive interspersing it with staggering world building is both a homage to the original, and very much earns the right to its own place in the Blade Runner universe.

The story is interesting and incorporates the predecessor in a sensible and meaningful way.    The film is visually very similar to the first, in its dark and intentionally sterile visual imagery.    There are some surprises.  The film shares some of the original's confusing elements; however it is good.  I watched it a second time and it is so layered and intelligent.   It can be watched as a stand alone but it ties so intelligently into the first one.   This is worth watching and watching again.

Even if you hated the first movie like me, give this a shot. It starts off slow, not stupidly slow like the first movie but slow, but it gets very interesting and it builds up.

            "content": "Blade Runner 2049 is a sequel that goes toe to toe with the original Blade Runner in terms of riveting visuals, atmosphere and memorable dialogue. The makers were wise enough to make the movie its own in terms of design and pacing, use sound and music in a creative way to hark back to the original and use CGI in a restrained and an unobtrusive way. Although the pacing is not as tight as the original the writing is not afraid to push this futuristic story into uncharted and disturbing territories. Like the original story the police are hunting synthetic humanoids, but with a plot twist- synthetic humans are killed if they are outdated in favor of newer more obedient models. The Blade Runner hunting the synthetic humans is himself a stronger, more resilient, more lethal and more observant synthetic human. All of this takes place in a dystopian view of the future where the cities are gray sprawling overpopulated over-polluted industrial wastelands devoid of any beauty. A new corporation has arisen producing ever more efficient and obedient synthetic humans headed by a creative industrialist. Given that the newer and more obedient synthetic humans are even more efficient killing machines than before the movie suggests in no uncertain terms that the fault lies eternally with humanity as a savage and immoral maker and not the creation. The main character in the movie, the synthetic human Blade Runner \u2018K' also has a holographic female companion. The notion that artificial life will seek companionship from other artificial life forms seems strangely unsettling, as if it requires some sort of supervision or that the need for companionship is a unique trait restricted to humans. The need for a machine to have need for companionship also makes it appear as a drawback revealing an interesting assumption that we view machines as supposedly efficient, but not ourselves as machines or at least accept that we are \u2018inefficient machines'. Whereas the original Blade Runner raised philosophical questions Blade Runner 2049 makes our transgressions and prejudices visceral and pushes them right in front of the audience.  Whether it is the slimy birth of a new synthetic model, children working in factories, intolerance for artificial life procreating or the dismissal of the illusion of free will underpinned by genetics, the movie doesn't pull punches. In his search for the offspring of Replicants the Blade Runner \u2018K' navigates a hellscape of industrial excrement, but the most damning indictment is that humanity ultimately gave up on the real world and morality and lives in the ruins of past efforts to produce more and more tactile fantasies.",

It is longer than it should be. The positives are : The cinematography is the best I've ever seen in a film, every frame looks like a beautiful painting. The score by Hans Zimmer was incredible, kind of futuristic I loved it. Ryan Gosling is wonderful in this movie as was all of the cast.

I've made about 25 minutes and I'm not engaged and need to switch it off. Maybe it's just too old for me. That's the assumption I've come to anyway So I'm giving this sequel a go in hope that a modern continuation of the story may help me enjoy it. \n\nBlade Runner 2049 starts off strong. Batista's brief cameo battling Ryan Gosling's \u2018K' is a strong opening to the movie and I have the assumption from this we're in for an action packed sci-fi extravaganza. I'm pretty wrong here I'll admit it now. The pacing of this movie is a problem for me. After that strong start, I assume they're building plot and the story. They are but it seems to last for a very long time. Every single time I feel it's about to speed up the story slows back down again. I remained engaged throughout but that's only through a conscious effort rather than a gripping tale. \n\nLook the premise for this movie is awesome. Even without seeing the first I love the idea of these artificial slaves having hope and a way of breaking their oppression. The movie just never speeds up even at the end of the film I'm left underwhelmed and a little disappointed. There's a few good moments but not any that blow me away. \n\nThe draw for this movie for me is the incredible visual demonstration we get. The film is beautifully put together and it literally jumps off the screen. I kind of wish I saw this at the cinema just to see how this came out on the big screen. I can imagine it was unreal. No matter how stunning the film is though it never blows my mind away just my eyes. \n\nThis film is fully advertised as being a combo of Ford and Gosling being the joint leads. The thing is though Ford doesn't turn up until an hour 45 into the film. He's only in it for the last hour and even then is not shown a great amount. The same with Jared Leto he's one of our main villains but he's barely shown and when he's on screen I find him a really dull character. \n\nThe star here is Gosling. He's absolutely brilliant as \u2018K' whose on his journey of self discovery and is breaking out of the way he's programmed. He goes on a great journey throughout the film and this is really his film and nobody else's. He's a brilliant action star and that's not something we see regularly from him. It's just a shame this film didn't have a bit more action for him to be involved in. If it did then my rating would have been much higher.",

It just feels very natural and it's really well given from all of the characters who are in this movie.\n\nAlso, the chemistry between Officer K and Deckard is great and it's built up so well throughout this movie.\n\nThe movie's even got some beautiful music composed by Hans Zimmer, Benjamin Wallfisch, Ron Bartlett and Michael Hodges. Those four do a great job on composing this beautiful soundtrack as a whole.\n\nThe pacing throughout this movie is honestly great and each moment is built up very well.\n\nThe cinematography from the man, the myth and the legend Roger Deakins is honestly so beautiful. He captures the scenes so beautifully and he does such a great job at capturing the moments so well.\n\nFinally, the action sequences throughout this movie are very clever and very graphic and they're also very well done.\n\nThe CGI effects hold up pretty well and they don't look very outdated at all, which is really good.\n\nThe green screen effects throughout this movie also hold up very well and they're very aesthetically pleasing to look at.\n\nThe movie's even got some great visuals which also hold up very well and they have such a unique look to them.\n\nThe set designs for this movie have a very beautiful and unique look to them, which I thought made them look very unique.\n\nOverall, Blade Runner 2049 is honestly a masterpiece and a half. The movie's got a great story, brilliant acting, brilliant dialogue, great chemistry, beautiful score, great pacing and some beautiful cinematography.\n\nThe movie's even got some very graphic action sequences, great CGI effects, aesthetically pleasing greenscreen effects, great visuals and some very beautiful set designs. \n\nI'd honestly recommend to watch this movie straight after watching the original Blade Runner (1982) it's honestly worth the watch.",

It's a \"thinkiing person's movie\" rather than an action movie.  If you read my reviews, you know that I prefer \"'thinking\" movies.\n It helps if you watched the original blade runner movie. It's interesting that the first Bladerunner movie was not a success financially when it came out. It has since come to be seen as a milestone in science fiction.  I think the same will be said about Bladerunner 2049. It will be looked upon as a cult movie.   \nThis movie is visually stunning. It has a deep meaning. It shows a glimpse of a possible future. \n Some movie critics criticize the movie for being over budget. They ask why it was necessary to spend $150 million on the movie when they should have known it would not do that well at the box office.  (same as the original Bladerunner).  What these accountants don't tell you is that you can't put a price on a work of art. This movie is a work of art. A work of art costs what it costs to make it. You can't cut corners when making art.   If you ask Picasso or Michelangelo to use cheaper paints, don't expect the same appearance in their finished product.  \n Yes, I am calling this movie a work of art - the highest praise I can give a movie. A work of art is something that I believe will last for decades at least.  It has a soul, an inner life. It is more than the sum of its parts. \n Before I close I will say one thing that is avoided by almost every review then I've read. The dialogue in this movie is amazing. There is not one line or even one word that is unnecessary. Everything that is said either advances the storyline or explains something.  Gosling asks Ford about a dog, \"Is he real?\". Harrison Ford could say, yes, no, or I don't know. Instead, he answers, \"Ask him yourself\".\nSo, crank up the projector in your man-cave or  bedroom TV., and make sure you have a good supply of snacks because the movie runs almost 3 hours including credits.

Though I think what is the hardest sell is Ryan Gosling's character.  In the first movie we seen a passionate lead character in with Ford.  He was hot tempered, impulsive, frustratingly doing the cold and dirty work of retiring replicants.  Gosling's character was more stoic and hard to connect with, which offered little diversions from the main plot (who's the replicants)",

One of the best looking films I've ever seen, amazing visuals combine with an ambient soundtrack to stunning effect. It eliminates the weird aspects of the Blade Runner 1982 while still feeling compatible with the world set up by that movie. I actually liked the original more in hindsight after watching this, it adds to the storyline and world.

If you are a fan of the original, you will most likely enjoy this film. However, for most of the modern audience, the movie is seen as too slow. As someone who thoroughly enjoyed the original, I was looking forward to watching this. I was not disappointed... for the most part. Aesthetically, the film looks absolutely stunning. Roger Deakins, who also did the cinematography for 1917, did an amazing job with Blade Runner 2049. I was even so amazed that I was sometimes distracted from the movie itself, which is a problem, I suppose. The story is somewhat similar to the original, asking the same questions, but it also adds the new element of replicas giving birth. This new fact has the potential to start a war, without giving too much away, the plot finishes in a very pleasing way. However, I did find that although Ryan Gosling is a great actor, he felt really stiff in this movie. More stiff than Harrison Ford, and that's saying something. The dialogue was also quite weak at times, but again, visually, it's absolutely amazing. I could honestly pick any frame of this as a background, and it would work. It is really a piece of art in that sense. The way that it merges the old and the new kind of reminds me of The Force Awakens, but in a way, I do think that this movie is better. I love this movie in so many ways, it looks amazing and asks some interesting questions, however, the script is sometimes dull and Ryan Gosling is stiff. But still, it's a wonderful thought provoking film that I would recommend, 8.2/10",

And, yes, that is a commentary on the younger generation, which makes up a majority of today's moviegoers.  Young people today just want to check their brains at the door and be entertained, but \"Blade Runner 2049\" won't let them do that--It's a movie for intelligent people, and there just aren't a lot of those around nowadays.  Personally, I think \"2049\" is even better than the original \"Blade Runner\" (which I think is a tad bit overrated) and might possibly be one of the best science fiction sequels in the history of movies, right up there with \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Aliens\".   Some scenes do drag on a bit too long, and that's the only reason I can't give it a full five stars.  But for 90% of the movie's length, I was riveted to the screen.",

The retrofitted future comes with updates: what more could a lonely Blade Runner want than a beautiful sentient holographic wife who can sync with real prostitutes? The rainy city's streets are still dominated by everything Japanese (although Ryan Gosling's anti-gravity car is a Peugeot, of all things).

It takes a thread about memory and it makes it it's focus. A worthy and artistic sequel and maybe the most beautiful and visually accomplished film since the first one. Consistently high quality, and a few blips aside, it's a pretty excellent film by all accounts.\n\nVery delicately it examines memory, artifices of love and devotion, expectation and duty, cause and belief. It deftly dresses a twist in a twist and plays with many of the themes inside the film and out. Long, messy, obfuscating with glaring holes in it, but also painterly to look at, trippy, hallucinatory, tender. It rises above its flaws and produces not just a perfect sequel but a tremendous, thoughtful, elegant science fiction masterpiece.\n\nIf you like Blade Runner a lot, you'll like this a lot. I happen to, so I was won over by its complex mood.  Blade Runner 2049 Succeeds spectacularly as a sequel to Blade Runner with the right balance of New and old. \nIt's got its flaws particularly around some generic plotting and some weak action but they really don't make them like this anymore. \nIf Blade Runner was a beautifully polished turd.

It becomes more about memory than ever: memories of memories (such as the holograms of his lost love or of Elvis); memories of other people's memories (driving the characters); and our own memory of the first film.\n\nBecause of this reference to our own memories, the film is somewhat stuck to its prequel, and though this involves us intimately, it's not always in a good way. It breaks the fourth wall by constantly reminding us that we're watching a movie.\n\nHere we also see the phenomenon of how sequels are strait jacketed by the premises set down in the original. This always risks a slight block to creativity, and belabouring once fresh ideas, and worst of all, narrows the corridors and shrinks the maze in which the writers can roam.\n\nIf the majestic pace of the original was supported by Vangelis's heavy score, this one drags somewhat with less air in the musical balloon to haul it along. Not one theme is memorable, and the whole score sounds like a bad pastiche.\n\nSuffused with yellow light and wonderful performances, there is gold to be found here, literally, but nowhere near the treasure of the original.",

Gosling plays a conflicted replicant blade runner who struggles throughout the film with the levity of the situation but in the end understanding that he is simply another cog in the works, a silent hero. Harrison Ford shows up and plays an old Rick Deckard excellently giving us a grisled performance. The orginal Blade Runner asked the question what makes us human?

            "content": "Thirty years after the events of the first movie, Blade Runner 2049 follows the story of replicant K (Ryan Gosling) who unearths a secret that could rock the world to its core. I remember watching this for the first time and scoring it high 90's. While I still think it's a damn good movie, I feel it falls just out of Masterpiece range.\n\nActing: 10\nGosling was stellar in his performance as K. Replicants walk the line of being human, but robotic at the same time. In some cases Gosling provides responses that are straight out of the mouth of a program while there are some scenes that require him to capture raw emotion, both unexpected and welcomed by me as a viewer. There were some other memorable performances as well, particularly by Sylvia Hoeks in her role as Luv. I'll be honest, she frightened the hell out of me, but in a good way. She was calculated and controlled, but you could always sense a rage waiting to surface. I love what she did with this character.\n\nBeginning: 10\nThe opening scene of this movie sees K tracking down a replicant that's been trying to fly under the radar. The tension is built slowly before it bubbles over. In the climax of this scene, we get a taste of what is to come for the rest of the movie. That's what beginnings are all about: Leave us wanting more!\n\nCharacters: 10\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 10\nWhile the entire film as a whole may not qualify as a masterpiece, the visuals and cinematography most certainly are. Throughout the movie, you get a chique futuristic feel that's also dreary and dank at the same time. It's like you're watching two worlds collide. I love their play on robotics and weaponry here as well, definitely a step up from the first film.\n\nConflict: 10\nIt's not just about the action here, but also K unravelling a mystery before our eyes. You want him to get to the bottom of everything going on and you're taken on a wild ride along the way. Between the shootouts with hi-tech guns and the hand-to-hand fights, there is more than enough to keep you entertained. \n\nMy favorite scene in particular occurs when K and Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) meet for the first time and square off. They are in some kind of concert hall where holograms are performing. Both are relying on the singing of the holograms to improve their striking position. It really is fun to watch.\n\nEntertainment Value: 9\nIt doesn't take you long into this movie to realize you're watching something special. The time and energy that went into the creation of this movie shows up on screen. Yes, it could have been shortened, but I still had a great experience.\n\nMemorability: 10\nThere is a scene that sticks out in my head where replicant creator Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) is looking over one of his creations. It's unsettling to put it lightly and you feel like it's just an average monologue\u2026until it's not. There are a number of scenes just like this that press on my brain. I also loved the continued exploration from the last movie of what it means to be human.\n\nPace: 8\nI do appreciate that the story took its time to unfold. However, I do feel like it could have been a smidge faster in spots. There were a few moments where I was thinking, \"Man, I got things to do! Let's go!\" Mostly forgivable save for a few instances.\n\nPlot: 10\n\nResolution: 1\nWithout giving anything away, I will just say that this is my least favorite part of the movie. To have started so strong only to end like this? Not impressed. I wanted more for K is all I will say.\n\nOverall: 88\nThere's nothing like good sci-fi when done well. Blade Runner 2049 will take you on highs and lows while giving you a visual feast in the process. I was not disappointed in the least and you won't be either.",

            "content": "Denis Villeneuve had a near impossible task in producing a worthy sequel to one of the greatest films of all time Blade Runner (1982) and miraculously he does. Despite casting Ryan Gosling, the Harrison Ford of his day, in the lead when he could have picked a more interesting character screenwriters Hampton Fancher and Michael Green populate the film with fascinating characters like Luv and Niander Wallace. The film is almost as beautiful as it's predecessor and contains action scenes that equal the pursuit of Zhora while continuing the exploration of the philosophical questions asked in the first film. I had high expectations going in and I was on cloud nine for the rest of the week having had all of my expectations met.\n\nThirty years after the events of Blade Runner, \u00e2~blade runner' K, Ryan Gosling, discovers that replicants can sexually reproduce and is told by his commanding officer lieutenant Joshi, Robin Wright, to retire the offspring of Rachael. Meanwhile, Niander Wallace, Jared Leto, the successor to Tyrell sends replicant Luv, Sylvia Hoeks, to steal the remains of Rachael, the replicant who reproduced, so that he can use them for his own nefarious means. K, a replicant himself, comes to believe that he is Rachael's child when his memories match up to information he finds. As in the first film, there is a climactic showdown between hero and villain where the lines become blurred and philosophical questions are pondered.\n\nBy far the best aspect of the film is the exploration of Luv's character because she is the most emotionally affecting in the film. Her desire to her prove herself to her near psychopathic father Niander is never more clear than at the moment at which the body of a fellow replicant is carelessly disposed of as we see a single tear trickle down her otherwise placid face. Her physical abilities are also impressive as she is able to match K in their final fight and when she confidently states \"I am the best one\" I felt the sort of excitement I have only ever felt at the end of Krzysztof Kieslowski movies. She was emotionally complex and it was fun to watch her fight the male lead, what more could you want from the female lead in a Blade Runner sequel?\n\nAlthough I would not consider Harrison Ford to be a great actor and I felt the lack of development in the relationship between Rachael and Deckard was one of the few flaws of the first film their relationship produced one of the most emotional moments in the film. When Deckard stares at a hologram of Rachael and is tested on his response he responds tearfully \"I know what I felt\" as he recognizes that the hologram can not replicate the feelings he had for the Rachael he knew. Ford is surprisingly able to sell the seen as we see a man who cemented himself as a gruff action star give himself over to the emotion of love as the awe in his eyes as the woman he loves touches him again is beautiful and touching. Had Blade Runner dealt with the love story better this scene would have been even more affecting but this scene does a great job at making up time on the predecessor's poor treatment of Rachael and forces you to care.\n\nOf the many, many wonderful things about this film the cinematography is obviously high up on the list as Roger Deakins, returning from the first film, does some of his best work. There is the beautiful orange sheen present in most Deakins film present here but even more so as the Wallace corporation complex is absurdly colorized and reflections of flowing water appear on the walls. Each shot could be framed and put up on my wall, even those of Harrison Ford's confused face, with the exterior shots in particular feeling like worthy successors to the iconic Coca-Cola commercials of the first film.\n\nThis is a fantastic film that should definitely be watched after seeing the original film and it's an absolute miracle that this film is as good as it is because if there were a terrible Blade Runner sequel in the world it would be an absolute tragedy.",

The narrative of Blade Runner never fell short of amazing other than Jared Leto's pointless character (and he can be easily overlooked). The pacing feels like a wave that you can watch building on the horizon until its finally on you and you don't know what hit you; There is tension and meaning behind its speed. Speaking of waves, there is actually a scene in the movie where Hans Zimmer's music matches with the action to make you feel like drowning in waves.... so much cinematic innovation. The purpose and theme of this story manifests in every second of the film (as opposed to the tangents that so many blockbuster films descend into.) I thought this was almost a perfect movie. It messes with you and shows you what the fire of honor looks like in a realm of torrential rain.",

            "content": "The year is 2049, there is the real world and the outer world, separated by a wall, presumably built by America and paid for by Mexico. Global warming has not been kind; LA is in the year of winter powered by the perpetually sunny state of California which has been covered in stunning solar panel towers. There is a shortage of crops but we still have cigarettes as tobacco fields are both an important part of American GDP and a great way to make someone look bad ass in the movies.\n\nIf this film is in any way a prediction of the future it's good to know that technology gets way out of hand, also buy Mitsubishi shares now, diversify portfolio with Coca-Cola and sex bots.\n\nOn a side note I once read that after Return Of The Jedi, George Lucas held back on making any more Star Wars movies until the technology was right. That might also be fitting of Blade Runner. The film just can't fail to disappoint, visually it's stunning, with its vast landscapes, baron city ruins, fallout zones, mega cities, and technological fantasy.\n\nBlade Runner also captures a complex and obscure dystopian future featuring child slavery, android servitude, and a macho world of sexual obscenity not too dissimilar to Duke Nukem's Land Of The Babes. Technologically there is a lot to take in, from the delights of hover cars to mainstream JOI companionship, in 2049 Joi is a robot hologram who will risk everything in the pursuit of syphilis. One bit of technology that stood out was the 4D TV's, I mention as Back To The Future also predicted them so I'm thinking it's only a matter of time folks.\n\nThe plot is enjoyable, it neatly works on its predecessor's mind melt that people can't guarantee that they're human because memories are implanted faster than the NSA can access your webcam but it adds a twist with Replicants urging to be recognised as equals, and you get the sense that the Replicants are gearing up for a Hunger Games style conflict sooner or later.\n\nThe Replicant's call to war comes with the discovery of a child born of Replicant descent. So basically this is the plot from Orphan Black, a child born from a clone gets hunted down by an evil corporation so that they can do testing on its genetic structure or something.\n\nHowever unlike Orphan Black there is less logic behind the corporations motivations to recover the child, for instance if they really wanted to produce well behaved drones then reproduction might not be the best way of doing it, on the premise that you have more genetic uncertainties and less control over production and data analysis.  Also it seems as if Mr Wallace has created a technology which has garnered him huge wealth and he's left looking a bit like a one dimensional super villain suffering from a god complex, with very weak motivations and a lack of depth. \n\nMs Luv also fails to use the company's firepower to wipe out K which makes it feel a bit like a weak Bond movie at times because you never feel like he is in critical danger and the one question you come away with is why at any point in this movie wasn't K killed when he could have been.\n\nThe LAPD leader is like the love child of Theresa May and Mariano Rajoy and her motivations to quell rebellion before it kicks off a referendum are a bit easier to understand. This makes the plot a bit more tangible and if the corporations motivations were a bit meatier this film would have a more complete feel about it.\n\nBlade Runner also attempts to raise familiar questions in AI SciFi such as when is an android considered equal to a human, when does AI start to think for itself, can AI feel real emotion and if so does such emotion relate to independent thought. With that in mind, despite the weak plot points, Blade Runner offers total escapism into a bizarre world, worth seeing for the innovative technologies, abstract ideas and stunning landscapes.",

Agent K is considered the worst kind of \"person\" because he is replicant who's job is to kill other replicants.

But the reason for that in my eyes is the design. The way the city looks, the dank and dark lighting, the creepy humanoid animatronics and replicants, the haunting score. The world looks so cool an interesting in that movie. Unfortunately when you actually go and watch it again it doesn't hold up that well. The romance is creepy, consent absent form the love scene. It doesn't really explore its own theme of if robots can be people very well, the most compelling discussion to be had on that topic is in the what ifs the movie inspires, rather than the actual content. And I also just don't think the main antagonist makes much sense. He kills indiscriminately, he's a monster, but we're supposed to suddenly care when he spares one life? Bah. Anyway. This movie. Blade Runner 2049 is better than the original. The world is back, the amazing atmosphere, the music. It's a little less grimy than the original, but it also feels like the world has progressed. It's not all the same future-tech. In the years since the first story they have advanced and it makes the transition smooth. Making the protagonist definitively a replicant was a great move, really allows the entire film to ask whether androids dream of electric sheep and all that. Each element of the movie balances a really well constructed mystery, as well as all of the ideas making K wonder if he matters. The whole cast is stellar, except for Jared Leto, who somehow managed to get his name on the poster for turning in two scenes of hammy, out of place villain acting. It's a really compelling movie, and a kind of sci-fi that we don't see on the big screen very often. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "There is nothing as natural than for movies to spawn sequels. As inevitably as cats have kittens, successful movies will have one or more sequels. In typical fashion the adage, 'strike while the iron is hot,' is applicable. The follow-up movie will usually be released while the initial buzz created by the original is still in effect, usually within two to five years. Lately, several immensely popular action franchises have been reignited even though the principal actor were returning after a couple of decades absence. It remains a significant discrepancy between men and women in Hollywood, but the shelf-life of action heroes has been greatly extended. Last year one of the most controversial, enigmatic cult science fictions received a sequel, 'Blade Runner.' The original film, 'Blade Runner' was a loose adaptation of the 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? By Philip K. Dick, released in 1982. That film rose to a level beyond a mere cult classic, through the highest echelon of Sci-Fi fandom to a zeitgeist-defining cultural phenomenon. It is far from unusual for a major studio movie to have numerous versions, sifted through and re-edited by the filmmaker to achieve the final product. Elaborate DVD and Blu-ray sets released becoming cherished collector's items. 'Blade Runner' has enjoyed this venerated status for decades, and with the conclusion open to interpretation, many fans have hoped for a sequel. It took longer than most believed possible but thirty-five years that immortal monologue atop the Bradbury Building, 'Blade Runner 2049' has arrived. Set in 'real time.' i.e., thirty-five years after the original fans rejoiced when it was announced that Harrison Ford would reprise his role joined by one of the most popular actors of his generation, Ryan Remolds. Not only has this near-mythical film been made but the cast is ideal.\n\nOne of the goals for the film set by director Denis Villeneuve was to venture beyond extending the dystopic Blade runner universe to expand it. The visual impact made by the original change the way the future was depicted. The streets were crowded, rain seems to be constant and the looming buildings festooned with gaudy, animated billboard advertisement. The opening shot of this film depicts a car, on autopilot as its occupant, K (Ryan Gosling), waking from a nap. The wide-open vista of this scene contrasted with the start of the original tells volumes without needing dialogue. Although the landscape is bright with the palette sliding from blues to orange, the overall feel remains desolate, bordering on despair. K is a Blade Runner whose mission is to retire outdated or rogue replicants. There was a long-standing debate as to whether Decker (Harrison Ford), was a replicant himself. K is unmistakably one of the advanced models. The distain displayed by his fellow officers calling him the ultimate pejorative for a replicant, skin job. A crucial piece of exposition is provided when K confronts his target. The replicant slated for retirement is one of the last of the old Nexus models. Before returning to headquarters. He found a box containing the remains of a female replicant who died during an emergency cesarean section. Against their design specifications, replication has somehow obtained the ability to reproduce sexually. When K reports his findings to his supervisor, Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright), who is concerned that if this fact became general knowledge, it would result in a panic that would result in the war pitting humans against replicants. Joshi orders K to locate and retire the child replicant. K's first destination is the Wallace Corporation, the successor to the inventor of the technology that replicants feasible, the now-defunct Tyrell Corporation, for help in identifying the maternal replicant. Through a thorough analysis of the DNA, it is determining that the sample belonged to an advanced model replicant known as Rachael (Sean Young). She was the seductively beautiful replicant who became involved with the original old school Blade Runner, Rick Deckard. Playing into the perennial favorite plot motivation, corporate greed is naturally infused as Wallace CEO Neander Wallace (Jared Leto) wants to discover the secret to replicant reproduction placing market share, profits and technological monopoly above any concern for the safety of humanity.\n\nK has a holographic girlfriend, Joi (Ana de Armas), who is formed using a projector on a free moving armature mounted on the ceiling. Besides basic companionship, Joi is capable of synthesizing rather substantial insight. When K discusses seeing a date '6-10-21' carved in the trunk of a tree, he recognizes it as a childhood memory. In talking to Joi, he realizes that since replicant memories are artificial, Joi suggests he might have been born. This exploits a narrative device of plot convergence. The idea of replicant reproduction careering towards the origin story of the principal protagonist. This ignites K's curiosity motivating his search of the LAPD leading to the discovery an unusual set of twins born on that date. K's investigation has the added benefit of providing details about the process used to manufacture replications. Crucial to the process is the creation of the artificial memories, fans always knew the existed, but now the audience is introduced to Dr. Ana Stelline (Carla Juri), a designer of replicant memories. There is no sense of contrivance as this new information seamlessly infused crafting a film that is satisfying to the most diehard fan of the original.\n\nTo be fully accepted by the fans a sequel is required to receive some indication that the new installment is 'blessed' confirming its status as canon. The fan could never accept this movie if Harrison Ford were not included in the primary cast the project would have been dead on arrival. This applies in general but after returning to his signature role, Indiana Jones and Hans Solo, after a considerable amount of time. His presence validates the movie permitting it to create its narrative. Instead of immediate dismissal 'Blade Rubber 22049' is the movie fans have been anticipating for thirty-five years. The theme of the story was unencumbered these ancillary concerns. Expanding some of the psychosocial questions raised by Philip K. Dick in his novel, 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' the question under consideration is among the most ancient, what does it mean to be human? The defining qualities of humanity have been pounded by religions, philosophers, and storytellers since people first gathered around a fire at night questioning the unknowable fabric of nature. This has been one of the most popular topics in science fiction often viewed through the prism of robots and later androids. With the growing concerns over the singularity, public attention has intensified. Over the intervening thirty-five years, sentient artificial beings have gone from our conjecture to the realm of possibility. This was the perfect time for this film. Pragmatically, Mr. Ford is 75 years old and plans to extend too far in the future would not be feasible. From a narrative perspective, the singularity is a hot topic, the subject of intense sustaining in the hallow halls of academia in disciplines encompassing quantum physics, computer science, and sociology. Having the replicants gain the ability to autonomously reproduce an intrinsic quality necessary to define life, at the lowest possible level.\n\nAs a bonus surprise, Edward James Olmos reprises his role as the enigmatic Gaff. Over the years Mr. Olmos has grown from a highly sought-after journeyman character to an A-List artist capable of incredibly nuanced performances. Addition of an actor of this caliber helps in providing the gravitas to the film necessary of rising to the intricacies inherent in the themes, so many sequels, particularly those overly delayed, are little more than the studio executives seeking to pad the year-end profit report. There is a literary impetus behind the creation of this movie, a genuine need to return to the story that has been with many of us for most of our adult lives. As with any worthy discussion of depth and meaning, this portion of the story raised more question than an answer. It should give the next generation something of substance to consider.",

It's honest from the start with Ryan Gosling's character; a on-the-patrol Replicant who hunts others replicants as a Blade Runner.

Credits to cinematographer Roger Deakins, every shot of 2049 is beautiful and this continues to be true in its intense, brutal action sequences. Overall, Blade Runner 2049 pays tribute to its predecessor but also builds on the world that it created, through stunning visuals and a provocative question to think of after the film. Its 3-hour runtime can be daunting but (for the most part) the films depth and sheer energy compensate.",

            "content": "Flawless. Denis Villeneuve is a rockstar filmmaker; a visionary who makes visually sumptuous films with so much heart and humanity to them that that one can't help but to praise his talents. Sicario was a great film but Arrival was a masterpiece and Blade Runner 2049 is just as brilliant. If I had a solid screenplay written, this is the man I would want to direct my film. I am a huge fan of Aronofsky and Danny Boyle but Villeneuve is the new generation of visionary filmmaker. There is not one thing I disliked or found wrong about Arrival or BR 2049 - in my eyes they are both PERFECT films. Engrossing, beautiful, layered, meticulous, and made with so much soul that I honestly cannot understand how ANYONE could not enjoy these films. \nIn my humble opinion, I consider this sequel to Ridley Scott's classic Blade Runner to be a superior picture on nearly every level. Scott's original was a visual feast & featured terrific performances from everyone involved, particularly Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young and Darryl Hannah. Here, the performances are just as powerful. Ryan Gosling is excellent in the leading role as Officer K, quiet, professionsl, duty bound but also curious and full of heart and when Ford finally appears  (long after half of the film has already played out ) he turns in another stellar performance as a weary, worn out Rick Deckard, 30 something years older but still full of fight. However, the scene stealers, the two standout performances belong  to two relatively unknown young actressss, Ana Dr Armas as Joi, Officer K's holographic girlfriend who genuinely seems capable of love, loyalty, and humanity and Sylvia Hoeks, as the ironically named Luv, a synthetic psycho killing machine custom made by Niander Wallace, an egomaniacal gazillionaire obsessed with creating the most human synthetic possible. Hoeks' performance as Luv is chilling; she is the perfect killing machine, loyal to Wallace but still independent enough to enjoy her work and to.go above and beyond her duty. She steals the show whenever she is on screen and is an excellent villain and formidable opponent to both K and Deckard.  \n\nBR  2049 can be (and is in many ways) a great standalone film  although to really appreciate it, you should be familiar with the original film, as there are tie-ins to it that you won't fully appreciate without having seen Blade Runner. In fact, the plot revolves around Deckard and Rachel (Sean Young's sexy synthetic from the first film who is not in this one, although old imagery of her is used to great effecf) and a child that they may or may not have had. Gosling'a obedient and result oriented K is tasked with finding this possible child and so is Wallace's ruthless, cold and methodical soldier Luv (a female variation of Michael Fassbenders's psychotic synthetic David from Ridley Scott's Prometheus & Alien Covenant films). And Ford's aging Deckard is caught in the middle of this battle.\n\nBR 2049 is a very long, meticulously paced film, at least one full hour longer than the original. Die hard fans of Blade Runner may cry foul and complain about the plot of this entry and it's epic pacing but I, for one thought if was a brilliantly conceived idea; not simply a rehash of the original but something fresh and intelligent. Yes, it is long (very near the 3 hour mark) but I didn't mind and never once was I bored and not once did I think to myself \"wow, what a long movie\" I was spellbound and so intrigued by the film that I wouldn't have cared if it had went on for another hour. This is entertainment of the highest calibur. Visually masterful, unbelievably vivid, solidly paced, with moments of stunning beauty interspersed with moments of sudden brutal violence. More than all of thar, it is thought provoking; an intriguing parable of what it means to be human. What is worth living, fighting, and dying for.  What it means to have a purpose, human or otherwise. K has to figure this out for himself; and he does in the end, after a nail biting climactic showdown. \n\nI can't say much more about this masterpiece, you must see it to understand  how very great it is. If you're looking for a straight up rehash sequel to the original film then I'm sorry to report that you will be disappointed. This is a sequel that stands alone and needs to be  judged on its own merits. I found it to be a flawless gem and absolutely one of the best films of 2017, if not thee best, along with the surprisingly superb Get Out. A rare Perfect 10.",

Not only was is beautiful to look at, but the broader questions about what makes us human are still used in film today. We didn't need a sequel. No one wanted a sequel. The original, despite its influence, had only ever reached cult status, and indeed wasn't anywhere near a commercial success. There was no real evidence to suggest that a second installment would be financially successful, either.  Blade Runner 2049, really shouldn't have been made, but Denis Villeneuve demanded to tackle the task because he didn't \"want anyone else to fuck it up\". Somehow he made an epic visual masterpiece that not only gave reverence to its predecessor but also stands on its own and builds on the mythology created before it. It addresses all of the questions, but without ever answering them, because to have the answers would cheapen the experience for both films. The movie also works as a self-contained story. Having seen the original will inform you a bit about the characters, but it isn't necessary. It also lays the foundation for a continuation, as badly as I want to spend more time in this world, I would also be happy if they quit while ahead. Surely lightning can't be bottled a third time.",

He was very capable of making movies that while boasting an attractive style, would let you down with half baked story lines and conventional Hollywood endings, whether they be     upbeat or bleak by the end of the last reel. Fortunately, smarter judgment prevailed and director Dennis Villeneuve--Sicario, Arrival, Prisoners-- was brought on bard to extend the replicant saga. Fittingly, the film is a luscious, lovingly detailed and poetically blurred vision of a polluted and decimated Los Angeles and western United States, and the enticing and confounding issues that arise from the creation of very human like androids to essentially function and exist as nothing other than a disposable slave class remain with us. The smart matter here is that the right story elements are drawn from the original film,the right characters are brought back to furnish       us with ideas as to how matters have changed over thirty years , the mysteries have deepened more so , and the mysteries remain. BR 2049 has all the issues the lured us in from the original motion picture, but it is its  own majestic,dystopian saga. It is equal parts meditation, philosophical debate, action movie, love story and, above all, a mystery, all the strands perfectly fused together seamlessly. This film is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "'Blade Runner 2049' is a movie that, at least for me, has been extremely anticipated for a very long time. The original 'Blade Runner' is one of my favorite sci-fi films of all-time, so when I heard that Ryan Gosling, one of my favorite actors, would be introduced into this universe, I was incredibly excited to see this. So when I finally got to see this movie, I left the theater with a new appreciation for what modern sci-fi can bring to cinema. This movie is incredible. I mean... where do I begin. The cinematography is the best I have seen in recent years, the acting from Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford and Sylvia Hoeks is impeccable, the story itself is consistantly mind-blowing and emotionally satisfying and the ending is beyond perfect. While the pacing in this movie could be an issue for common movie-goers, I found these \"slower\" moments in the film to be completely made up for by the eye-pleasing cinematography executed perfectly by, the great, Roger Deakins. This return to such a beautiful, sleek yet somber world is beyond welcomed for me and many others, and the people behind the camera who worked on this movie knew exactly how to portray the futuristic version of Los Angeles.\nDenis Villeneuve does amazing at directing this film. So many times we ask ourselves nowadays \"Where are the new greats? Where is the next Kubrick? Where is the next Scorsese? Where is the next Tarantino? Well... I think we have found our answer. Except for Christopher Nolan, I believe Villeneuve is the next great. With films like 'Incendies', 'Enemy', 'Prisoners', 'Sicario', 'Arrival' and now 'Blade Runner 2049', this guy has yet to disappoint.\nRyan Gosling is probably my favorite actor working in Hollywood right now. He consistently chooses to be in movies that have a true meaning. With every film he is in, he is trying to have the audience walk away with something that they did not start watching the movie with. Sure, he's been in some duds, but when his acting hits, it hits hard, and he is usually my favorite part of every film he is in. His ability to disappear behind a role is unreal and truly inspiring to me.\nHarrison Ford. Boy, does he bring it in this film. I was worried walking in that he would possibly sleep-walk his way through this film, but to my pleasant surprise, this is his strongest performance in the last decade. His is so good as Deckard, and he is always proving to me why he is one of my favorite actors of all-time.\nSylvia Hoeks is an actress I had no knowledge of prior to this film. When I first saw her on screen I was intrigued, but also unsettled. Her performance in this film is scary, yet mesmerizing to watch. Her character is conflicted, but knows what she has to do. Her role as the villain of this film is great. To me she is unknown, and she holds her own with great actors such as Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford and Jared Leto.\nThis film has a mystery that kept me engaged for it's entire 2 hours and 45 minute run-time. I can't suggest this movie enough. If you are a 'Blade Runner' fan, you will adore this film, and even if you are a casual fan of movies in general, I am confident will have a good time watching this story unfold. 'Blade Runner 2049' was one of my favorite films of 2017.",

This new version certainly isn't going to be as seminal or as divisive, nor will it create such a strong fanbase. However, it is to be enjoyed as what it tries to be: a well-crafted blockbuster with a unshakable ideological stand-point. Apart from plot or ideology, nonetheless, the prodigious directing of Villeneuve proves once again that he is one of the best working in the film industry today. Despite never reaching the heights of Arrival, this movie (which is not a film noir) is compelling to its core and every shot feels right at home. Contrary to many Hollywood directors, Villeneuve isn't afraid to keep some shots longer than they're expected and to compose them in an innovative way. He manages to imprint into the movie an overall sense of eeriness caused by its vastness, the off always feeling far greater than what you're watching. I would say that the only thing working against his vision is Walker's editing and some lack of character development in most of the characters. But even if it can be said that the shots are too short, the same can't be said about each scene as each one of them has room to breathe and has a narrative pay off. It's such a long movie that never gets to be cyclical or dull, as every integrant part of the movie is working together as whole to be captivating. Furthermore, the casting is fitting, especially Gosling who is balanced and grounded in that dystopian world.  However, every single element of the film is outshined by the most revolutionary and stunning cinematography of the year. You really don't expect that every single shot in a blockbuster will showcase such an amount of detail and care for visual storytelling. Even if you dislike the movie as whole, you have to appreciate the visual wonder it displays, as the color palette is crafted to a point in which it fits each scene's necessities, despite its variable content.I would say that it can be considered as one of Villeneuve's worse but it speaks volumes that it is still incredibly solid. It's a film that gets you hooked by its plot, but makes you stay for continuous technical and creative achievement. It will certainly be rewatched time and time again, and will serve as an example of a sequel done extremely right.",

The references to the 1960s were valuable, but in general, the mass amount of detail that went into this film made it seem a lot more believable. I had never seen a movie from Villeneuve, but after this one, I should rethink it! Another key component to this film was the scenery, as there were so many creative and unimaginable setting included with the impressive acting. The script was a masterpiece and the effects even more. I have seen this film now over 4 times and counting, as it's easily one of the most de watchable films of the 21st century.",

The world of the original Blade Runner was dark, greedy and full of philosophical questions and 2049 manages to not only preserve the previous film, but expand on its predecessor. What a surprise it was to see Harrison Ford not as a cameo but a real character. Just how much of the modern films ever do that? The original film was quite slow-paced and sometimes boring to watch, but the world it showed, the questions it raised kept many fans going. And now we get this, a slightly modernized version of Ridley Scott's masterpiece. But it was modernized in a very careful way, trying to save as much of the setting as they possibly could, while improving what they couldn't. Blade Runner 2049 is still a slow film, unfolding its detective story in such a way that you can't even predict what is going to happen next. It leaves you at the edge of the seat at every plot twist you encounter. The world became even darker and harsher and the protagonist is almost always has to overcome difficulties, that he can't even grasp. All in all, Blade Runner 2049 is full of solid performance from the actors, gorgeous visuals, great camera work and atmosphere.",

The original film left such a legacy because it explored Philip K. Dick's original story without sacrificing storyline or characters to popular trend mechanics. It was a simple enough tale, with few key characters and action sequences used sparingly but exceptionally. 'BLADE RUNNER 2049' not only keeps up with its predecessor, it brilliantly expands on its overall importance as a pillar of science fiction cinema. Perhaps no other actor currently in Hollywood could have fit the role of Officer K more perfectly than Ryan Gosling. His complex character rhymes with Harrison Ford's iconic Deckard to deliver pure, unmatched chemistry. Robin Wright is fantastic, Jared Leto is terrifying, and Ana de Armas delivers one of the greatest performances of the year as the film's greatest centerpiece. The cinematography, exquisitely crafted and blended by Roger Deakins, is unparalleled -- some of the most beautiful moments of filmmaking I've ever seen are proposed throughout the film's unraveling, creating a marvel of cinematic imagery that is overwhelmingly powerful. There is not much that I can come up with with regards to negative components of this film; Everything seems to work perfectly, due to Denis Villenueve's unbelievable work behind the camera and precision as an auteur director. He proves himself to be more than capable of adapting the world of Blade Runner into a sequel, something that could have gone horribly wrong in so many ways and yet surpasses all shadows of a doubt and delivers an unquestionable work of modern art. This is a glimpse into the possibilities of filmmaking that could be explored by so many talented actors, directors, writers and producers within Hollywood, but is so rarely captured as magnificently. I could not award this film anything less than a perfect score. It will remain one of my favorite films forever.",

One thing's for sure, there can be no doubt that it's a well-acted and visually stunning affair, with gorgeous cinematography that captures a beautifully built world, rich in details to marvel at. Add to that the superb directing from Villeneuve (bonus film-nerd points for K's introduction which is almost an exact, frame-by-frame replica of Scott's original idea of how to introduce Deckard) who manages to coax the absolute most out of what's available, creating an incredibly immersive atmosphere and leaving you with a subtle and affecting exploration of what it means to be human, interspersed with some heavy action sequences. It's a very different film from its predecessor (yet it still manages to feel like it's part of the same universe created by Scott all those years ago) and whether or not the slower pace, philosophical focus and contemplative tone appeals to you will be a matter of taste. Personally, I loved it and it not being quite as well-rounded as it could have been just means that it's slightly off from being perfect.

It's a shame that was the end of the love affair with this movie.\nI felt no connection with K. No sympathy for the overplayed skinjob hate from his fellow officers. The only emotion the film managed to wring from me was when Joi's transportable Emanator was crushed. I had more connection to a holographic companion than any of the film's characters. Even Deckard had lost his charm.\nThe story seemed to go nowhere very slowly through a very beautifully crafted world. The plot was predictable and sedentary, and held none of the vagary that invited the speculation of the original.\nI think the movie was made to make money before telling a Blade Runner story.",

He just talks and talks.\n- Leto is your standard take over the world bad guy. \n- It's maybe 15 to 30 minutes too long.\n- A lot of long scenes that could be trimmed down.\n\nIt improves upon the original in every single way and it's one of the greatest sequels ever made. But, it's really two movies. An A.I. cop hunting down A.I. beings, and also his love relationship with another A.I. The first story is good but the relationship story is even better and should not be overlooked as a side story. \n\nThe movie made me sad at the death of Joi, which is great film-making considering she's not real. Or was she? Asking if Joi was real is kind of irrelevant though. If A.I. can satisfy emotional needs and mimic human behavior, then how is A.I. any different than a person? Because she's not real? \n\nWhat is real? What is real enough for you? And does it matter? And would you even care? \n\nI mean, aren't people already in love with their technology? No one can live without their phones. You carry the phone around with you wherever you go, constantly interact with it, and the phone literally sleeps in the bed next to you.

But the best aspect of this flick is, by far, the eye-popping, amazing special effects and what's even more extraordinary is that the movie makes them look so normal, so simple.

I loved every second of this movie, and cannot seem to find one thing critically wrong with it. Usually the more I think about a movie, or watch one that I notice things I don't like, and I've thought about Blade Runner 2049 for a solid week now. It's perfect. Director Denis Villeneuve, along with this film and his other masterpieces, has sealed himself as one of the best directors of all time, and this film is the best reason why.\n\nThe original film (a review for that will come later) is also a science fiction masterpiece, and one that people didn't think needed a sequel. It was so simplistic, yet so beautiful, and one wouldn't think that anything could be added on to it. But we got a film with the most engrossing, beautiful, and naturally evolving story lines I've ever seen. You just have to see it to believe it, and know how carefully crafted this film really is. It starts so simple but unravels itself to you so brilliantly, that it seems like everything is happening in real time. I know that's the point of a plot to unravel itself, but so many movies nowadays are so predictable, especially sequels.\n\nThe cinematography is gorgeous. Roger Deakins almost always does the cinematography for Denis Villeneuve films, and he has this subtle beauty to every single one of his shots and it makes them all so uniquely profound. Simply put, the film is shot perfectly.\n\nThe acting is great all around. Gosling fits into this world very well, and Harrison Ford reprises his role exactly how you'd imagine he would. I was hoping he wasn't just going to be old, tired Harrison Ford, but he was honestly better in this movie than he was in The Force Awakens. The girl who played \"Joi\" was phenomenal, and this is easily her best role.\n\nThere's not much else to say but go see this masterpiece, and watch the Final Cut of Blade Runner before you do. The themes expanded upon in this film of love and fear are so beautiful, and are done better than any other movie I've ever seen. Needless to say, it's one of the greatest movies of all time. 11 out of 10",

The effects were great, as was the atmosphere, cinematography and the sheer aesthetic brilliance of the dystopia being presented. When I watched Blade Runner 2049, longer than its predecessor, I found all these pros to still be intact, but what made the original such a tough sit were also true for the belated sequel. Denis Villeneuve is an excellent director who has proven himself capable of handling thinking-persons Sci-fi with Arrival. But here, in his attempts to establish a dark, brooding atmosphere, he allows shots to go on for an obscene length of time. Add to that the long pauses in conversations, the scenes of people doing nothing but staring and the interminable shots of people walking or flying ships, and you have a film which is roughly an hour longer than it needs to be. Jared Leto, a brilliant actor given prominent billing and a good chunk of the poster, is given almost nothing to do besides wander around spouting vague, Godly diatribes that contribute nothing to the story. His entire role could have been cut out and nothing would be sacrificed. Likewise, Harrison Ford is supposed to be a heavy supporting player, but gets little screen time and is rarely, if ever, the focus. I admire what the film tries to do and how it's put together, but everything takes too long to be said, if it even needs to be said at all, and scenes prattle on and on, at best without haste and at worst without purpose. Unless some heavy trimming was done, I won't be watching it again anytime soon.",

The first movie was a rather dark one after all and this one is a truly post-apocalyptic one. I quite liked the first movie despite its dark setting though. However this one takes the darkness and melancholy to an entirely new level.\n\nAs I said before, technically the movie is great. The scenery is stunning whether it is a dirty little hut out in the badlands or the equally dirty vast cityscapes. The scenes of the abandoned city where Decker is (re)introduced is sad but beautiful.\n\nThe acting is more or less great from all the main characters and the special effects are very well done and just right to fit with the rest of the movie.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars.

Purchased the movie in 3d to match my theatre viewing experience...and on my fifth home viewing....still incredible! The speculative, marketing inspired demise of 3d in North America is undoubtedly and assuredly premature. 3d format or otherwise the movie remains a masterpiece. \n\nIt should be the Oscar pick for best movie of 2017, and the cast including Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, Ana de Armas and others nominated in respective roles. Consummate actors all, not to mention Denis Villeneuve as Best Director. Thank Ridley Scott for recognizing his genius.\n\nThe reality is that Science Fiction, even as a statement on the human condition, has never won an Oscar for Best Movie, as far as I know. The Academy Awards will likely miss this, caught up in the social media swamp and the cause of the day. The Academy will likely instead vote for an odd duck or more common place take on the triumphs and tribulations of the human condition, all destined to become mediocrities and also rans for 2017. This in turn, as it continues to demonstrate, makes Oscar night nothing more than a gossips' social gathering and more redundant and meaningless than ever in what it's function should be - rewarding real achievement in film.\n\nMeanwhile like the first Blade Runner, Blade Runner 2049 will continue to attract an ever growing following and challenge current and future movie makers to raise the bar on what is now possible.",

Overall a predictable and worn out storyline that's painfully boring to watch.  Save your time and money.",

            "content": "Strengths: Holy crap. This movie is gorgeous. Every single frame is breathtaking. The cinematography is just splendid. With the stunning visuals out of the way, the next thing to commend is the storyline. It's compelling and gets much better as the film unravels. There are several twists and turns that really keep you on your toes. The score was magnificent, giving this film the trio of great direction, score, and writing. Then, there's the acting. Ryan Gosling (K) was a great choice to take over as the lead. He consistently shows his range, giving a great performance once again. His scenes with Harrison Ford (Rick Deckard) weren't plentiful, but they were highlights. The stuff where Rick chases K through his Las Vegas home is some of my favorite stuff all year long, and 2017 was a great year for movies. Ana de Armas (Joi) was quietly the show stealer. Though she's an AI, there's a humanness to her character and you really feel for her. At first, I thought the sex scene was possibly a waste of time, but it added to her relationship with K and made what happens to her mean even more. The other small roles are all well-acted, from Robin Wright (Lt. Joshi) to Dave Bautista (Sapper Morton) to Jared Leto (Niander Wallace) and everyone in between, there are no bad performances.\n\nWeaknesses: At 163 minutes, this is one long film. It feels a bit longer because there isn't a lot of action, especially in the first half. It can be tough to maintain focus while some of the story unravels. Though I though Leto was fine in the role, I wasn't a big fan of the Wallace character. He didn't fit the antagonist role the way I hoped he would\n\nOverall: Once again, Denis Villeneuve delivers. This film took a slew of talented people (Gosling, Villeneuve, Ford, cinematographer Rodger Deakins, etc.) and gave them the platform to deliver a memorable show. It's exactly what I want from a sci-fi film. A great story, masterful visuals, and a fantastical world. One of the best films of a crowded 2017.",

The movie's pace is slow, with points of action left sparse, but the soundtrack and cinematography keep you interested. The acting is superb, including by Ryan Gosling who had a bit of a reputation going into this movie as being the guy from Magic Mike. If you're a fan of the previous Blade Runner this can be disconcerting going into the film - but Gosling proves that he's a dynamic and talented actor. Characters from the first film are brought back in the sequel, but it's done so in a natural way that doesn't feel like pandering - an issue that some returning franchises have had trouble with. Overall, it exceeded my expectations that I had into it.",

The film continuity was very believable. There were no flat-screen TVs, the Blade Runner universe created a clear path for technological advancement, and this film followed it. The dark atmospheres with monochrome rays of light are still there, and even poked fun at once. Any fan of the original will fall in love with this movie. On the contrary, many who have not seen the original may not like it as much; it's definitely a sequel that rewards the viewer from remembering the first. \n\nIt's a long movie, but each minute matters, but it takes a bit of thinking (and memory of the original) to feel the significance of those moments. From what I've gathered, most of the rotten reviews probably hadn't seen, remembered, or liked Blade Runner. If you are find of the original, then I'm almost positive you'll love it.",

            "content": "We now find ourselves in an age where the filmmaking craft is so preoccupied with making money that it hinders the art form itself and saturates the market with crowd-pleasing dross. The rise of the superhero blockbuster has played a huge part in this and, as result, the creative and artistic  nature of Blade Runner 2049 has become a casualty. Like Ridley Scott's film before it, it has proven to be a box-office failure and despite the desire to provide sequels, the masses simply weren't interested in this one. But 2017 took the sequel to a whole new level. They weren't just money-spinning exercises but revisits to much loved cult classics that were intent on exploring their characters in a whole new depth: 20 years after the drug-addled exploits of Trainspotting, Danny Boyle brought a satisfying maturity to T2 while, 25 years later, David Lynch revisited the quaint logging town of Twin Peaks with The Return - a deeply surreal 18 episodes that has reinvented the way that television can be viewed. Going even further back than that, Denis Villenueve revisits Blade Runner after a 35 year hiatus and relieves my nervous disposition with the impressive completion of a 2017 hat-trick.\n\nPlot: Former blade runner, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) has been missing for thirty years and now LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling), has taken over the role of \"retiring\" replicants that don't conform to society. When K unearths a secret that has the catastrophic potential to plunge what\u0092s left of society into chaos, he has to find Deckard to get answers to what actually happened after he disappeared.\n\nA lot of credit must be given to director Denis Villenueve for taking on one of the biggest gambles in filmmaking history. To take on the unenviable task of delivering a sequel to the 1982 Ridley Scott classic, Blade Runner, shows real, self-assured confidence. Villenueve took the task on simply because he thought he could do a serviceable job while fans of the original (myself included) had strong reservations about a sequel even happening in the first place. As is always the case, however, the proof is in the end result and I couldn't be more happy that Villenueve has been vindicated. His vision of Blade Runner both expands upon its predecessor while also complimenting it's narrative depth and ethereal beauty. \n\nVillenueve's decision to open on a close-up shot of an iris is an obvious choice - with perhaps the only thing missing being a referential wink to the audience. Within seconds he goes on to depict an expansive, genetic farming land that's as desolate as it foreboding and already the opening \"Hades Landscape\" of the original springs to mind as Hans Zimmer creatively riffs on the iconic Vangelis score and manages that fine balance of reminiscence and originality. From here on, it's clear that we're back on Blade Runner territory and I'd be lying if I didn't say it felt good. \n\nThere are many subtle references to the original throughout the entirety of the film but Villenueve is clever enough to make this film his own without succumbing to a pastiche. His deliberate pace will ostracise many viewers but it's entirely in keeping with the films meditative themes and allows cinematographer Roger Deakins the luxury of immersing us in this dystopian, retro-future with an abundance of gorgeous imagery. There's not a single frame wasted as Deakins delivers one of the most beautiful pieces of work ever committed to the screen. This visual genius has been nominated for an Oscar 13 times and he's lost every time. If there's any justice at all, he should win on his 14th attempt with this. This truly is a remarkable artistic achievement.\n\nSuch is the visual mastery, you could be forgiven for getting lost in Deakins' sumptuous scenery and miss key elements to the plot but Villenueve, or more particularly screenwriters Hampton Fancher and Michael Green, explain things in relative layman's terms. It's not difficult to follow but sometimes can border on cliche and convenience. I didn't fully buy into some plot developments but the questions left from Deckard's past were, somewhat, unavoidable and this film provides some answers which slightly take away from the original's ambiguity. That said, it's an unavoidable line that had to be crossed and it's afforded a lot of care and respect. \n\nAlthough, the narrative is fairly simple the similar weighty existential and metaphysical themes are prevalent again. Where the first film explored the nature of existence, 2049 takes it slighter further and ruminates in what it constutes to have a soul and if you're looking for a reliable lead that can convey such world-weariness then look no further than Ryan Gosling. Gosling has fast become a physical master of minimalism and, as he has already proven in Drive or Only God Forgives for example, he can convey internal struggle by practically doing nothing - which makes him absolutely perfect casting here and apparently the first (and only) choice that Villenueve had in mind. He shoulders a lot of the philosophical weight of the film and holds things together when the pace is lesuirely and there's the overhanging (and overbearing) 1 hour 40 minute wait for Deckard to even appear onscreen. It's a wait that's worth it though, as it kicks the film into another gear and brings with it Harrison Ford's best performance in years. There's also more than able support from Ana de Armas as a complex hologram that longs for emotional connection and a megalomaniac Jared Leto with delusions of godliness. In other words, Blade Runner 2049 is a remarkable refurbishment and a genuinely astounding spectacle that manages to hit the beats of the original and still find its own rhythm. \n\nSome critics have have went as far to claim that this is an improvement over the original. Although I wouldn't go as far as that, this is still a magnificent continuation of the mythos. The only sour note is that it descends into slightly generic action material towards the end which jars with the deliberate and meditative tone that preceded it. That said, it manages to turn this around and when credits rolled, I found myself in contemplative silence, exhilarated by what I had just witnessed. Sequels that can achieve such a balance and expansion on their much loved predecessors are a rarity and, as a result, 2049 can take a bow and is fully deserving of a rapturous applause. Villenueve has only gone and made things we fans couldn't believe - a worthy sequel on the shoulders of a giant.\n\nMark Walker",

In a 'could have been a short film but was blown up into a long film' kind of way. All the pieces were there for an interesting mirror-take on the original (the parallel-reversals dont seem to stop, almost at times fully feeding the scene) but the flatness of presentation was underwhelming. I feel as though when it came time to the fourth draft, it was decided that the visuals, sets, and stars would just carry some tensions, without the gravity and significance of a plot to hold it in place. At times, some screen time wasted on everything but the signficance of the character's actions.\n\nAnd yes, I got the twist and the plots and the points to be made, but it felt like Cliff Notes version to me, of a vastly superior film, or a 'could have been'.

The visuals, characters, story, themes, and amazing cinematography are perfect in this piece of art! It manages to continue the original story in a great way while being able to stand on its own. Only a few other sequels manage to do that, with examples being The Empire Strikes Back and The Godfather Part II. This film is able to capture the idea of being human and make it into an engaging story. It offers questions such as, \"Does one need a soul to be human?\" \n\nIn conclusion, I find this film to be a cinematic masterpiece, topping Ridley Scott's 1982 magnum opus in every way. It's a one-of-a-kind film that I consider to be one of the best ever! Because of this, I hope that this film is not forgotten and is historically remembered as a piece of cinematic perfection!",

The cast all fits there roles, the returning Harrison Ford is his usual self (my wife even watched this, mainly cause of him I'm sure), Ryan Gosling is very good as K, the Blade Runner of this movie and even Jared Letho is good. The story kept my attention through out the movie and whilst it is long. Its a very deliberate piece of story telling. After sleeping on it and thinking about this movie I think a 4 star rating is completely where it is. Denis Villeneuve is fast approaching Christopher Nolan as my favorite director. His visual style is all over this movie and he depicts a time not to far in the future to be very dystopian. Under lying themes, concise story telling and great visuals all account to a great sequel which unlike other recent Alien sequels push the story in a satisfying manner.",

Mainly, Jared Leto's character, Neander Wallace, wants to know how to make replicates that can reproduce because raising a grown person to 20 years of age is supposedly easier than manufacturing a replicate...wtf. And somehow this genius thinks it's actually a good idea to give a slave race that's stronger than them, the ability to reproduce. Consequently, this would also bring the ability to mutate and evolution, but whatever. I also had issues with some of the performances and found that I didn't care quite as much about the characters as I should.\n\nNot to say it's all bad the detective work was interesting, it doesn't spoon feed you, and it's hypnotic and visually rich.

Perhaps the most beautiful film I have ever seen.\n\nIt truly is a Neo noir masterpiece. \n\nNow that brings us to the NEW BLADERUNNER 2049. A pale comparison to the original in every way. what a flat, uninteresting borefest of a film. Yes there are some inspired visual moments to be had but they are only here & there.

Villenueve seemed like the perfect choice as director following up his brilliant film Arrival. One of the greats in the cinematography world, Roger Deakins on camera and some great source material to work with.\n\nUnfortunately lots of talent does not produce the desired results in all cases. The new Bladerunner really falls short in every way. I was also disappointed in the films score which was so unique to the original film. Sure this score is inspired by and is good as a stand alone but to make the decision to almost abandon the originals score best points was another mistake in my opinion. \nOne high light here is the surprisingly good performance from Harrison Ford who's acting really shines here. I've always liked Ford as a movie star but never have I scene him display acting chops as he does here. The high light of the film.\n\nOne of the worst things I can say about a film is \"why did they bother making this\"? That is what I was saying to myself as this film about very little was winding down in the theatre.\n\nSave your money and avoid this snoozfest of a film. There is very little here to like. Pull out the original final cut version and watch it on a large display or screen and marvel at what a truly fantastic film the original is.\n\nUnfortunately this one should have never been made.

Denis Villeneuve, the director, does cajole for you to reach out for the material outside the world. And through crisp clean environment, colored magnanimously and beautifully by the production design and visual effects. I'd like to draw your attention towards the enormous set pieces staged by the amazing artists working behind it.\n\nThe world, as always, starts with infinite choice and hence ambiguous never-ending locations and as this case moves forwards and Ryan Gosling finds himself closer towards the answer; if there is any, the set pieces grows definite and within the questioned boundaries, to a degree, that in its last act, three is a crowd, is framed on the screen. These tiny aspects of this chapter, is what makes this film a better storyteller, than it has to say. For as far as the themes are concerned, there is a lot of seen-this-seen-that phases. And yet, with splendid cinematography and its iconic background score, the film nails a work on the wall that cannot be interpreted as anything but art.\n\nAs this series has shown us, the characters are often mended as some puppets and the world they revolve around, the puppeteer. And filled with incredibly expressive details, even the behavior of the characters and the change in their perception is carried out through their surroundings. Gosling enters this franchise with a calm resilient body language and comes out from the mission shook and moved by the consequences of his action. And this action is a particularly noble one, in contrast to Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard in the previous chapter. And maybe, this is what's appealing and crowd pleasing to the audience, the hope that someone as Blade Runner, could melt down.",

            "content": "A sequel of a beloved sci-fi classic coming 35 years later is going to elicit comparisons. Which film did what better? Is this new iteration faithful and obedient in replicating the original? Will the 2.0 version make the earlier film obsolete, or can the past uphold its legacy? And what of our memories-how will knowing this new chapter in the life cycle of Deckard (Harrison Ford) affect our remembering of his origins? Thankfully, Blade Runner 2049 is a strong addition to the universe created by filmmaker Ridley Scott and screenwriter Hampton Fancher based on a Philip K. Dick story. Deliberately paced, with a strong sense of atmosphere and compelling visuals, this is a sequel which builds upon the original foundation without ever quite surpassing it.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 is wonderfully nostalgic, evoking the unique aesthetic of the original film while crafting its own visual style and narrative structure. Cinematographer Roger \"Give him an Oscar already\" Deakins is at his finest here, working with Denis Villeneueve to create awe-inspiring, spectacular images within the frame. The score from Hans \"Make It Louder\" Zimmer and Ben Wallfisch draw upon the technological hums and drones of the original Vangelis score while adding a bit more of a sinister tone underneath the enormous \"WHOMMMMM\" sounds shaking the theater seats. The environments of the futuristic Los Angeles have a lived-in feel to them which is right in step with the original film's dark-and-grim aesthetic. Some sequels or prequels, such as Blade Runner 2049 producer Ridley Scott's Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, suffer from technological amnesia, where the technology within the film reflects the era of the film's production more than the world within the film itself (e.g. How come the spaceships in Prometheus are more technologically advanced than those in Alien?). Blade Runner 2049 wisely keeps with the Atari- and Russian-filled details of its predecessor while adding a few key technological upgrades, such as hovering drones and hologram A.I.\n\nThis attention to technological detail is present within the very plot structure, as the opening scrawl of Blade Runner 2049 reveals that the world has recovered after a technological blackout, allowing for the creation of new obedient replicants and the need to hunt down and \"retire\" any older versions. The film centers on LAPD officer \"K\" (Ryan Gosling) in his film noir-like search for answers to the questions he's having about the nature of replicants. Gosling's performance is wonderfully muted and winsome, but it's Harrison Ford's moments as the older, grizzled Deckard which I found most affecting. It's one of Ford's strongest performances in years, at least since 2010's Morning Glory. The way he carries himself, the few scenes which allow him to really emote-he's softened over the past 30 years, and that's a good thing. The snarky, stoic Deckard from 1982/2019 has matured into someone who can hold his own in a fight while being honed and refined by the passing of time.\n\nThe biblical allusions in Blade Runner 2049 are quite overt, with strong parallels to the Genesis story of Rachel and her son Joseph. There's an oppressed group desiring freedom from their captivity, and a twisted creator/captor (Jared Leto) who makes a repeated reference to the replicants as \"angels\" in their human-like nature. These scriptural notions underpin the film's philosophical questions: What does it mean to be alive? What is the nature of a soul, of the material body? How does technology affect our ethics, our sense of existence, and our need for community? Do our memories make up our identity, and if so, what happens if those memories are altered or lost? What does it mean to be real? I was reminded of a plethora of sci-fi films, ranging from the more recent (Her, Ex Machina) to those of decades past (A.I., Metropolis), and I think that's in the film's favor. It's not aping the original Blade Runner film, nor is it copying previous sci-fi efforts (although one intimate scene does feel a bit too much like a moment from Her). Instead, Blade Runner 2049 joins the ranks of excellent big-budget sci-fi films in its world-building and prophetic capabilities. The best sci-fi doesn't just make us think about the future; it's a mirror for the present, provoking us to consider our situation and our souls. Though no moment outshines the iconic \"tears in rain\" scene with Rutger Hauer, there are glimpses of brilliance and wonder to behold.",

No movie released in 2017 could hold a candle to BR2049's atmospheric delights.\n\nThe bad news: It's uninteresting. Boring, even. Blade Runner The Elder worked so well because it was a cramped, personal meditation on the nature of being human, and/or just being. Very small people wrestled with very big questions in very tight spaces, surrounded by very large, very distant corporations, isolating the characters to stew in their own existence. \n\nBR2049, by contrast, is a grandiose confection. It's pretty and sweet and empty. Many of the themes and devices in Blade Runner The Elder have been stripped of their potency by advanced technology or just lazy writing. No need to mess the the audience's head about who is or isn't human; just look up and to the left. No need to puzzle out dilemmas or meanings, the movie just tells you, its characters functioning as conduits, spelling out every theme without the need for thought. Yawn.\n\nPerhaps that's why, despite ample screentime given over to humanizing Ryan Gosling's K, you just don't care about him or his problems. He's not a person, he's a device, and if that's the point, it's less an artistic achievement and more a meta commentary on lazy filmmaking. Yes, it's beautiful, and that took a lot of hard work, but it was obviously meant to be a spiritual successor to The Elder, and as such, is lazy. Unpacking The Elder was the work of much consideration. There is no need to unpack BR2049; it's already unpacked and then slapped across your face repeatedly. \n\nThe question I kept asking myself was, \"Who is this movie for?\" Fans of the original? Doesn't seem likely. New-to-the-franchise (a 3rd movie is already being discussed) viewers? This is hardly the place to begin. People who just want entertainment? Highly unlikely. No, the answer I kept coming back to was the filmmakers themselves. Not in a face-only-a-mother-could-love kind of way, but in a we-made-something-beautiful kind of way. In an awards show kind of way. Because if BR2049 doesn't sweep every technical award, I'll be pretty surprised.\n\nIt's just not a particularly good *film*.",

Thanks to bringing back original screenwriter Hampton Fancher who I imagine has been thinking about more Blade Runner for 35 years, and director Denis Villeneuve who, based on the clear reverence on display in this sequel, may have been thinking about Blade Runner for nearly as long, 2049 mines the themes/images/ideas of the original in unexpected but perfectly organic and satisfying ways. It is not much of stretch to say that 2049 is a much more mature and deeper film than the original. In the 35 years since the original, the question of what makes a human has been asked and answered, analyzed and re-asked. Technology has altered the question as humanity gets closer to the reality of artificial intelligence, so this film has to be deeper on an intellectual level but it is also just a better made film.",

Already \"Runner\" is a great film, yet one that I don't really feel I need to return to that often, and certainly not as liked by me (for Ridley Scott movies) as \"Alien,\" so there's that strike against it. Well, Villeneuve rose against the tide and concocted a masterstroke of motion-picture goodness.  He and screenwriters Hampton Fancher and Michael Green were able to take the basic ideas and template of the epic 1983 original and embellish the lore and universe of that predecessor, and they do it successfully without disregarding the source material or pushing it too far in an unfortunate direction (looking at you, unneeded sequels \"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" and \"Jason Bourne\"). Like the first \"Blade Runner,\" it poses such wonderful questions of our existence, but this one engaged my attention in an even-deeper way. The lead performances are excellent, with Harrison Ford reprising his role of Deckard with relative ease (adding subtle layers to the character's progression) and Ryan Gosling actually inhabiting a character this time around. Normally I find him stuck in two modes with his acting: his version of \"charismatic\" that comes off as artificial (as seen paired with Emma Stone in \"La La Land,\" \"Gangster Squad,\" or \"Crazy, Stupid Love\"), and portraying stoicism which could be read by viewers as cold or wooden (i.e. any of his more-serious roles, such as in \"The Ides of March\"); here, he sidesteps those extremes to play a driven, yet emotionally-complicated, cop of the future.  Even Jared Leto, whose thematic talents are usually too over-the-top for my taste, is relatively toned-down here. Yeah, there are a few scenes here and there that I concur with the critical consensus where five to ten minutes of screentime could be cut (especially in the second act, where at least a half-hour could be trimmed); however, for the most part the pacing did not bother me to the extent that it did in the first \"Blade Runner\"'s opening. I did have a little more of a personal issue with some of the nudity in the flick, though. I know it comes down to personal taste, and one of the sex scenes in the movie is artfully done, but a couple of the later moments (featuring a supporting actress in the computer-avatar, but non-android role of the cast) seemed to me to have less of a sub-textual point than simple titillation and simply unnecessary. That said, otherwise this film is definitely the best I have seen in 2017.",

One thing I really want to mention about Blade Runner 2049 is that it finished in such a way that just screams for a 3rd part.

The awkward virtual dating side plot thrown in for novelty. a plot twist to end it all on that wraps up nothing and is not explained at all. An evil junkie who rambles endlessly about drivel to seem more sinister. Also for being banished, there are a lot of replicants walking around earth totally unquestioned. Complete crock of shit.

I respect the original a lot for what it did for movies, but as a story some parts of it fell flat for me; this seems to have a much clearer idea of what it wants to do and say. I don't want to spoil anything, but I found pretty much every character (even minor ones) sympathetic in their own way; I think it does a better job than the original of examining what it means to be human through different lenses. This is also one of the most gorgeously shot movies I've ever seen, I kept getting distracted from the story by just marveling at how beautiful everything looked and how much there was to see. The sound design and score were also incredible; I feel you could watch it with your eyes closed and still get so much of the emotion and context out of just how the movie sounds. The cast all do amazing jobs, it's still a slow-burn but the action that is there is brutal and exciting, my only criticism would be that it dragged in the third act for me. Fantastic movie though, through and through",

It was one of those sci-fi movies that became one of my favorite legendary movies. The landscape shots, the ever so slow but nice pacing, and the story itself is so marvelous, and of course the soundtrack is intensely satisfying. Harrison Ford as the Blade Runner made it more interesting and he's one of my favorite actors anyways. Plus, it is one of Ridley Scott's best films ever.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 is no different and with modern age actors jumping into a world of wrought and oppression, it is another classic being redefined. At first, I was skeptical at how Harrison Ford's character Rick Deckard plays into this story because it takes place very long after the first one. Star Wars: The Force Awakens work well with his character Han Solo but I was still skeptical with his character Rick Deckard. I mean, how do you propose to continue a story that seemed to be left in a thoughtful \"happy ever after\" ending? Well the director Denis Villeneuve did just that and it really worked out pretty well. It's another movie that proves that even in 30 or so years, you can still pick up story if it's written and done right in cinematic form. All the essence from the first movie are all presented so well in Blade Runner 2049, that it is another favorite movie of mine. Ryan Gosling as the new Blade Runner, named Officer K has once again made me like his performance and I never thought he be this good again in an action type of movie since Gangster Squad.\n\nJared Leto does an outstanding performance as someone who bought the old company from the first movie and began to start developing technology that we're familiar of: Replicants. Robin Wright, omg, what a lovely woman. Her character as the bossy and though Lieutenant Joshi was great as well. An actress that I don't seem to be familiar of, has done some amazing performances in this movie as well and she totally got me off guard. Her name is Sylvia Hoeks, who played as Luv. A character who works for Jared Leto's character Niander Wallace. Harrison Ford's reprise role of Rick Deckard brought me to a personal emotional moment. Especially bringing up the past via the first movie. No doubt that his performance is pretty damn good as always. The beautiful Ana de Armas does a wonderful performance as the titular hologram character. In which I thought she has little spotlight but I'm glad I was wrong because she has a great spotlight in this movie and it's very nice. Her chemistry with Ryan Gosling is so outstanding, that I wish they did another movie together.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 gave off the same kind of vibe that I get with the first movie and it's because the landscape shots and the soundtrack made itself a unique movie. The story progression is so good that even Dave Bautista was so cool in this, even if it was just a brief time. I'll be sure to pick up a copy for myself of this movie but it's just so damn good.",

The presentation of the future is still a great warning for all of us. The movie has amazing FX and has some actions. But the main effect of this movie is still the atmosphere and partially Vangelis alike music. I say alike, because it's a pale imitation of Vangelis style and the music is sadly not always that great, and become too many times a collection of sound effects. The actors are excellent, even the side characters are interesting. Don't go to that movie if you want an action flick or you are tired. The movie required your attention, even if it's mostly a visual film, the plot can be elaborate enough. Villeneuve did a fascinating movie that will go into the rank of classic, with the original one...no less. The music is maybe the aspect where it seems too loud and lacking variety.

            "content": "A sequel to a 35-year-old sci-fi cult classic was always going to be a hard sell. It's a small miracle that a film like Blade Runner 2049 was even made, the original wasn't exactly a money maker back in 1982, nor did the studios at the time allow the film to stay narratively true to its original vision, hell Ridley Scott didn't even gain control of his own film cut till 2007. So here we are in 2017, with an unlikely sequel on our hands.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 does a great job of expanding on the themes of the original, while still managing to tell its own compelling story. Ryan Gosling plays the stone-faced Officer 'K' in a nuanced performance, arguably his best performance since Half Nelson. The supporting cast is standout throughout, bringing the world of Blade Runner 2049 to life, and let me say this, what a gorgeous world it is, frightening and awe-inspiring. Roger Deakins is at the top of his game here, the cinematography is absolutely jaw-dropping, which is not surprising coming from a man who has been nominated 13 times for an Academy Award.\n\nThe languid pacing of the film lends itself perfectly, even though the runtime is 2:45 hours I didn't find myself for one moment disinterested or disengaged, which is quite a feat for a film of this length. The combination of visual flair, sonic mastery, and expertly crafted script make Blade Runner 2049 easily one of my top 10 movies of all time. Please, please please, I implore you, go watch this movie, on the biggest screen possible, experience this film.",

            "content": "So where could they possibly take the Blade Runner franchise after the one-and-done original? Even as 2049 began, I had no idea, but somehow it manages not only to build on the original, develop the story naturally, and evolve it's themes, but sometimes even surpasses them. Replicants have had a rocky history in the last thirty years, being prohibited and brought back gradually after a series of violent outbursts. The Tyrell corp was bought out, there was a blackout that wiped out electronic records across the globe, and even a famine.\n\nSapper Morton benefitted from the famine with his protein farm, living a secluded life away from the dystopian hustle-and-bustle of LA. Until the day K arrives to bring him in, unraveling a miracle impossible to believe that could shake the very foundations of human society if the truth ever got out. To say more would potentially ruin the movie. I went in relatively blind and the mystery that surrounds the whole thing - the origins and revelations of each individual character - gave me so much joy to watch unfold. However, take this as your warning, I wouldn't be able to write the review I'd want to write without spoiling some pretty major stuff, so stop reading now.\n\nThe single biggest theme of both the original and 2049 is what it means to be human, what it means to be alive, how to measure consciousness and sentience, and whether that offers certain rights or not. 2049 builds on that, introducing new concepts with the express purpose of exploring and extrapolating this theme further. K is stated outright from the very beginning that he is a replicant. It's important information as he plays into how he's treated, and how he thinks of himself. While he thinks for himself, he is programmed to obey, and yet that doesn't make him come across as any less human. He's still treated as a lesser-class citizen because of it though, the same way white supremacists treat black people, or Myanmar Buddhists treat the Rohingya. One party sees themself as more important, as more real, and spit on those who they see as beneath them. K is at the bottom of the heap...to a point.\n\nThe most fascinating exploration of this theme in 2049 for me though was the character of Joi. She's a black box on K's wall, an evolved form of Amazon Echo and smart homes. She's an artificial prostitute without the sexual contact. For K, she's he's only companion, his best friend, his confidant. Strictly speaking she's an AI with holographic representation and nothing more, and yet she demonstrates more. She passes the Turing test with flying colours, convincing as a sentience all her own, with her own beliefs, her own desires, her own fears, her own personality. When K \"gifts\" her an emanator so she can leave his apartment and become mobile, she shows genuine delight and wonder at experiencing rain and watching it drop through her holographic fingers. And yet other replicants treat her with disdain. She's artificial companionship, a lesser being who's even less real than they are. It's a truly fascinating angle injected into the movie.\n\nAnother fantastic part of 2049's story is the use and subversion of the 'chosen one' trope. Final warning for MASSIVE SPOILERS here. As the underlying mystery unravels, K starts to believe he is the key to it all. He's about the right age, with a memory that connects him to orphanage records. As the movie goes on, both K and us - the audience - are increasingly led to believe that he is more than just a replicant. He's a special case with the key to everything. We watch him develop from nothing special, to the key to everything, before one final twist that causes this belief in himself to come crashing down around him and he just becomes nothing special again. It's an unprecedented character arc that subverts expectations in the best way. Even after he learns the truth, that he is nothing special, that Joi is just an AI product that told him everything he wanted to hear, he turns himself into something special. He risks his neck for a man he now has no connection to. He picks a side, embraces his heroism and goes for it hell for leather. After learning he wasn't special after all, he goes out and makes himself special, the hero of the story. If nothing else, that is what makes 2049 such a captivating story.\n\nBut there is something else. There's so much in 2049 to unpack, and I want to talk about all of it. Chief amongst them is the cinematography. Roger Deakins is Hollywood's biggest awards underdog. His work is simply astounding time and time again, and 2049 is no exception. Every frame is a canvas to him, as he paints glorious strokes of colour and composition. Every scene outside is grey and miserable, with snow falling peacefully around, and the streets covered in sludge. Everywhere looks like a miserable place to be, whether it's LA's slums, or the rubbish tip that is San Diego, or Morton's maggot farm that resembles a moonbase. The opening shots of the film show fields that stretch as far as the eye can see, bringing them into focus as warehouses, hangars, and industrial greenhouses. Wallace's headquarters tower above the iconic Tyrell pyramid, made of the wealthiest commodity; wood, while Deckard hides out in the irradiated wasteland of Las Vegas, bathed in red and orange hues.\n\nThe soundtrack is a bit of a mixed bag for me. I was disappointed to hear that Johann Johannsson had stepped down from scoring this film, as his work in Arrival was exquisite. Hans Zimmer stepping in was a bit meh. While he's strictly a fantastic film composer, his more recent works have felt phoned in (barring Dunkirk, of course). Another source of immediate disappointment was how little 80s influence there seemed to be. There's the odd synth here or there just peaking out from the cacophony, but otherwise it does little to try and emulate the sound of Vangelis. Furthermore, the soundscapes and ambience that permeates most scenes don't exactly sound like they're beyond Johannsson's skill set. It's the exact same kind of music he scored for Arrival and Sicario.\n\nThat said, what Hans Zimmer and Ben Wallfisch have crafted is still an amazing piece of sonic work. It's an auditory experience felt as much as it is heard, and it brings so much intensity to scenes that would be otherwise lacking. The music never takes the limelight or overstays it's welcome. It's a presence whose impact is felt even when the movie is silent. In fact the sound design in general is just about perfect, adding a whole new dimension to the film, including a fantastic sequence in a vintage casino with Elvis holograms that cut in and out suddenly.\n\nThe acting is also top-notch as well, of course. Ryan Gosling has become famous for his unblinking stares, some of which speak volumes with little surface emotion, while some falls flat and just looks lazy. I saw a video that took the piss out of his blank-faced expressions in the trailer, which was funny and kind of true, but having watched the movie, his lack of facial emoting makes sense. He's a replicant after all. Strictly speaking he doesn't, or at least shouldn't, have emotional responses. He's a blank slate stuck into the world to do one job and one job only. Thankfully the enthralling character arc allows Gosling some room to work, and the emotions he does realise are fully formed and fully empathising.\n\nA big mention goes to Harrison Ford as well, who's turned himself into a bit of a meme in his old age, reviving old franchises and lazing through every scene as if he doesn't really want to be there. 2049 is an exception to the rule. He doesn't go into this for the paycheck, he has a genuine interest in the film, it's source material, and the script that was written for it. He offers his best performance in years, without a doubt, and creates all the impact of the final scene all by himself. Ana de Armas is also really, really good as Joi, giving her a sense of humanity and sentience that quite literally brings her to life. The chemistry she and Gosling share is palpable and goes a long way to developing her role as a non-sexual companion. Sylvia Hoeks is menacing as Luv, Wallace's right-hand assistant. While she doesn't get quite as much meat to play around with, she does have her interesting moments tapping into what it means to be an artificial sentience. The way she treats Joi is heartbreaking, and her snarky posture makes her just as human as her protagonistic opposites.\n\nJared Leto, Robin Wright, Edward James Olmos, Dave Bautista, Mackenzie Davis, Lennie James, Barkhad Abdi, and even a brief appearance from Sean Young all share varying levels of supporting roles, and all enhance the movie in their own little way. Whether it's Wright's subtle advances on K, Bautista's marvel at the miracle he witnessed decades ago, James' quick change of character when he realises K is a cop, or Leto's menacing philosophical musings, each of them make their mark on the movie in such a way that they'd be missed if they weren't there, whether they have two minutes of screen time or fifteen.\n\nFinally I want to mention the CGI, which is used brilliantly. Just like the scoring, it's never overbearing and never steals the limelight. It's used to enhance and not to create all by itself. The vast dystopian vistas would be nothing without CGI, Joi's holographic representation would be nothing without it, and Sean Young being de-aged was a narrative necessity. On the note of Joi's holographic representation though, one of the finest displays of 2049's CGI is a beautifully tender scene between her, K, and Mariette, a prostitute who's tasked with shadowing him. Seeing as Joi is only holographic, K cannot physically interact with her in the way either of them desire to, and so Mariette becomes a surrogate. The way Joi merges with Mariette, and they sync up together and bleed in and out of each other's movements is just about one of the most impressive things I've seen for a long time. The way it's somehow kept from turning creepy or weird, and instead remains tender and beautiful is all the more impressive.\n\nCould 2049 hit a perfect 10/10 rating? I don't think so, but I don't rate anything that well on a first or even second viewing. It has a hell of a lot going for it, from the way it balances nostalgia and self-referentialism to enhancing the story and themes of the original without retreading old ground is probably the best thing about it. But the story it tells and how it wants to tell it is executed to perfection. I have no doubt that in future, if I fancy watching Blade Runner, I'll choose 2049 over the original. Despite being slow and really quite long, it uses every moment to it's favour, building character and atmosphere perfectly. I give 2049 a 9/10, without hesitation. I already want to go to the cinema and watch it again.\n\nhttp://qyrosmovies.blogspot.co.uk/",

Love it!!!!!\n\nOnly for that I will give 3 stars!\n\nWatch it once or twice and forget it -> the original movie i watchs 70 times and this i will  never see again.\n\nPS: the world looked too clean and sterile!",

My only fault was when there would be an auditory or visual callback to a scene from earlier in the film once a character realizes something set up by that scene.  That's nitpicking, but I paid attention well enough to realize what was happening on my own, without the movie spelling it out for me.  I think this movie will age really well though and will pick up steam over the next few years or so.",

On the other hand if you thought either Rachael (Sean Young) or Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) was the most interesting character in the original film then you will likely feel disappointed here.\n\nI can't emphasize how poor this script is in quality of writing. There isn't a single speech worthy of Roy Batty's \"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe...\" \n\nWe also never get a memorable quote like Rachael's \"Have you ever retired a human by mistake?\" when she first meets Deckard, something that cuts to the heart of the issue of being human vs. android. Ryan Gosling is fine in the lead but his character seemed to have been rehashed entirely from \"Drive\" and transplanted into Villeneuve's overwhelmingly depressive universe. The villain was also poorly conceived and thoroughly unbalanced to care about. He's a pale imitation of Tyrell. \n\nI also found the music in Blade Runner 2049 to be inadequate. It's only similarity to the original is that it is electronica, otherwise it is depressingly dark, overbearingly loud, and without respite. It misses the mark of the brilliant Vangelis soundtrack of the original which mixed a futuristic melancholic cocktail. \n\nDenis Villeneuve is an eccentric but inconsistent filmmaker who needs scriptwriters who can match his vision. Blade Runner 2049 rests on the razor's edge of pass/fail.",
