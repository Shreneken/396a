    "summary": "In the near future, a weary Logan (Hugh Jackman) cares for an ailing Professor X (Patrick Stewart) at a remote outpost on the Mexican border. His plan to hide from the outside world gets upended when he meets a young mutant (Dafne Keen) who is very much like him. Logan must now protect the girl and battle the dark forces that want to capture her.",

            "content": "Loved it! Such a breath of fresh air from the cookie-cutter superhero formula. Not that that's not fun from time-to-time but y'know. I loved how it showed the darkest parts of being a 'hero', with Logan being a total down-and-out junkie. And then how while he doesn't make a complete 180 by the end, he manages to muster up just enough fatherly instincts to pull through for Laura. The ending pretty much had me in tears, just when their father-daughter bond finally starts to form, he gets what he'd been wishing for the whole time, at the worst moment. Can't help but think about the could-have-been's about Laura and Logan's barely there bond. How, in the end, just once, he was a good father to her. 10/10 will definitely be watching this again!",

            "content": "Let's cut to the chase, shall we? In every beat, every frame, every moment, LOGAN feels like the Wolverine movie Hugh Jackman has been waiting (and training) for 17 years to make. Set free of a PG rating, this wildly kinetic film has plenty of gore, action and violence pumping through its veins. But what makes this one of the finest superhero movies ever produced is the big, messy, somewhat broken heart beating at its core.\n\nSet in a grim near-future where very few mutants remain alive, we meet an unthinkable incarnation of our favourite enclawed superhero: one who's decidedly past his prime. This is not the near-immortal Wolverine we remember, but Logan (Jackman): a broken, far older man who feels the weight of every wound inflicted upon him. His once- formidable body \u2013 tattooed with scars that aren't healing as fast or as well as they used to \u2013 seems to be failing. It's only his determination to keep the ailing, ageing Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart) safe and alive that never falters.\n\nThe film's plot kicks into overdrive when Logan's fate becomes entangled with that of Laura (Keen), a close-to-feral young girl who brandishes claws and fury as fierce and lethal as Logan's own. As the unlikely trio go on the run, we see echoes of Logan himself in Laura's terrifying rage and the tentative emotional connection she forges with Xavier. It's one of many smart moves on the part of James Mangold, who does double duty as director and co-writer. Bringing Laura into the picture allows him to explore Logan's trauma, regret and hope through the filter of this pint-sized powerhouse's origin story.\n\nIn effect, Mangold has placed an intimate family drama squarely at the heart of this ostensible blockbuster film \u2013 strip the characters of their superpowers and LOGAN would still pulse with plenty of heartbreak and humanity. Logan keeps dragging himself through the world when one suspects all he wants to do is die. Xavier grapples with his own frailty as his once-sharp mind deteriorates and betrays him, again and again. Laura is a tough, tender mess of contradictions: a victim of horrific abuse but also a warrior in the making. Watching them interact \u2013 fighting, screaming, arguing, glaring and, once in a while, forgiving \u2013 will elicit laughter and tears (lots of tears), in a way that no other superhero film to date has quire managed.\n\nThat doesn't mean, however, that LOGAN is an entirely joyless, sombre affair. Far from it. It proves, quite conclusively, that films in this genre can plumb the darkest of psychological depths while finding welcome ways to leaven the misery. (Note: this is something Zack Snyder would do well to learn as he continues to expand DC's largely mirthless cinematic universe.) Mangold threads moments of genuine humour into the proceedings \u2013 from casual shoplifting and runaway horses, to an ornery old man who refuses to take his pills.\n\nThe fast and furious action beats in LOGAN are also quite delightful to witness. The violence that's on full, bloody display is dark and horrible, but somehow fitting for this film in which there really are consequences for battles fought and lost. It's only when you see Logan's claws plunging into flesh, shearing cleanly through meat and bone, that you realise just how neutered and family-friendly his earlier outings were. There's a slow-motion sequence halfway through the film, as Logan struggles to get to an embattled Xavier, that's gritty and beautiful to watch \u2013 as thrilling as that scene-stealing Quicksilver moment in X-Men: Days Of Future Past. And it goes without saying that watching Laura gracefully spin and slice her way through oncoming attackers manages to be terribly wrong and wonderfully right at the same time.\n\nTo be quite frank, none of this would work without the incredible cast, all of them doing award-worthy work that will, sadly, be overlooked because their characters have such silly things as 'powers'. It's truly unsettling to watch Stewart dig beneath his natural gravitas to find the shaken core of a Professor X who's semi-consciously losing grip of his mind \u2013 the best and most dangerous mind in the universe. Keen is a revelation. Grabbing this breakout role by the throat and making it very much her own, she somehow manages to convey Laura's childish fragility and overpowering strength, often in the same breath.\n\nAnd, finally, there's Jackman. He's been training for and playing the role that catapulted him to global stardom for 17 years now, and he brings everything he has to this final outing as Logan. He nails Logan's physical tics, of course: from his grizzled and aged demeanour, to his rattling cough and copious drinking. But Jackman also takes delight in unearthing the dark sadness at the heart of this once invincible, now vulnerable man. There is a hope and purity in Logan that doesn't always show through his wisecracks, but it shines brightly and unexpectedly here \u2013 often in the film's saddest moments.\n\nThere are a handful of things about the film don't work quite so well. The main antagonists, played by Richard E. Grant and Boyd Holbrook, are largely forgettable \u2013 there's not much that defines them outside their nefarious goals. As many viewers may be turned off by Logan's relentless misery and eye-popping violence as those who welcome it.\n\nBut this doesn't detract from the fact that LOGAN is a remarkable achievement. It manages to be several things at once: a bruising action film, a tender family drama and an intimate character study, liberally shaken through with comic-book sensibilities and a Western or two. If Jackman really is hanging up his claws for good, there could be no better way to bid farewell to one of Marvel's most enduring and appealing characters.",

The opening scene perfectly captures how Logan has been beat down by years of hardship and how he only cares about himself. The movie expertly weaves in its commentary about capitalism by showing how the whole world has gone bad and how liberty has been destroyed and how multiple companies use their power to walk all over ordinary citizens. As Logan, Charles, and Laura begin their journey its clear that Charles, despite his ailment, still cares about other people and wants to help Laura get to her friends. As the journey continues, Logan begins to care more and more for Laura but still resists fully committing himself to helping her. That is until the very end, where Logan realizes only he can save Laura and her friends and he does, even though it means his demise. Finally then, Logan can die as a hero as he has completed his mission and saved Laura. The music always captures the right emotions for the moment and overall, this movie is just perfect! Definitely a movie worth watching over and over again!",

            "content": "\"Logan\" is not the usual comic book movie we normally have\u2026 it's a different kind of comic book movie, going deeper into the drama and the character study. It presents an older Logan and Professor Xavier, who have been through a lot, and have changed with the world they're in. This future world they're in is interesting and mysterious, introducing us to questions, but not giving us answers, making the movie even better and more intriguing. Hugh Jackman is brilliant, going in a different direction with the character and giving us an older, deeper, and denser version of Logan. We can see that he knows what he's doing, and that he loves the character. Patrick Stewart gives us a very different Professor X, one that has done terrible things and that has to deal with that until these days. That is something dark and deep about the character, but he's also very funny and portrays this old grump, also being able to make him sweet and tender. Just like Hugh Jackman, he goes in a different direction with the character, not being the wise character that he was before, but a flawed and deeper character. It is definitely one of the best acting I've ever seen. And the little girl, Dafne Keen has the blood in her eyes, and the determination necessary to portray Laura. The script uses the formula it's using for its advantage, giving us a well rounded journey that's all about changing and being able to deal with the past, while still having to move forward. It develops its characters in a way that makes the plot progress in a steady rhythm and tone. The gore used in the movie is absolutely necessary for the portrayal of these characters and where they are now in life. There are some moments in the movie where you feel like it could be doing something more interesting, or advancing the story a bit more, but overall, this feeling is overcomed by some amazing, deep lines and moments that the movie gives us. There's a twist in the middle of the movie that\u2026 is brutal. The makeup is also very well done, and helps us understand the characters better. And lastly, the cinematography of the movie is beautiful, giving us the rustic feeling that the movie requires. \"Logan\" is a comic book movie that goes beyond its barriers, giving us a story focused on characters and their changes in life, that's deep, visceral, profound, and beautiful.\n\n9.3/10",

The direction is more than extraordinary and the editing is rightly adequate. The atmosphere is perfect and always maintains a tone of melancholy but at the same time of hope that everything will go well. The characters are incredible, including the villain. Outstanding performances by Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. The ending is as emotional as it is heartbreaking.

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\n\"Logan\" is directed by James Mangold and stars Hugh Jackman for one final go around as Wolverine. With an R Rating secured, something the previous two Wolverine films should have had, \"Logan\" was bound to be fantastic. It wasn't fantastic. It was phenomenal.\n\nIf you are going into \"Logan\" expecting every scene to just be Wolverine tearing people to shreds you'll be thoroughly disappointed. This is definitely not an action film. There are action sequences in the film, but they are not the main focus of the movie like the previous 2 Wolverine movies tried to make them be. \"Logan\" is a grounded film, a film that really takes its time to tell its story and to develop its characters. It's a character-driven film, and it probably has the most characterization in an X-Men film to date. We get enough of Wolverine's backstory within the first few minutes to really become attached to him (if we already weren't). We learn more about Professor X and what he has been doing, and then there's this little girl, who probably should be annoying, but luckily isn't and that was a sigh of relief. This girl, Laura, is the star of the show. It is really \"her\" movie. All of the sequences with Laura were riveting. There was that sense of mystery to her character that you wouldn't really expect from a film like this. You don't ever really know what her next move is going to be. Her motivation to find a safe haven is so well felt in this film that it just brings you a sigh of relief that there is still a sense of good out there in the world of this film where everything seems dark, bleak, and hopeless.\n\nHugh Jackman's performance. Yeah the dude gave it his all. This is by far Hugh Jackman's best performance as Wolverine. We've never seen Wolverine this vulnerable. He's old, he's broken down, he's beaten. He can't heal like he used to. The conviction from Hugh Jackman in this movie was just spot on and really captured the ways Wolverine felt at certain moments. It added layers to this film. When Wolverine gets into a fight, Hugh Jackman is so good in these scenes it's like he got into a fight with the filmmakers on set.\n\nThis film does not hold back from a violence standpoint. From the get go, you know what type of movie you are in for. It is brutally violent, by far the most violent X-Men film w have gotten. Wolverine hacks, claws, and slashes his way through skirmishes with blood, guts, and gore flying. If this is what you had always wanted from a Wolverine movie and haven't gotten it up to this point, well this movie gives you all of that.\n\nFrom a violence standpoint, the violence is there when the film calls for it. It is not violent for the sake of being violent. This is a film that puts its characters and story first before anything else, with violence being a secondary element to help propel the story along and to create tension. It is in the scenes where it should be. If this were just an all-out 2 hour and 20 minute \"hack-and-slash\" fest this film would have no depth to it. It would look cool, but giving Hugh Jackman the proper sendoff was what was more important in a film like this.\n\nThis film at times gets downright emotional. The final scene of the film makes you wanna cry. You care about these characters, you are invested in them. You don't want to see them put in harm's way. Even in the scenes where the film may feel a bit slow, the final act of the film is the payoff. This is where everything really meshes together with a force, creating a pulse-pounding, edge of your seat final sendoff for Hugh Jackman as he retires from the role.\n\nThis is by far the best Wolverine movie and possibly the best X-Men movie to date. I haven't decided yet. It's up there, and it deserves to be. Everything payed off in this film. It is emotional. It is character driven. It has heart. It is emotional. This is everything anyone could have wanted in a Wolverine film.\n\nFrom me \"Logan\" gets a perfect 10/10.",

Saw it again a few days ago and it was every bit as good as I had remembered and now I also believe it's the best superhero movie ever made.  Great story and acting, good action without being too much or completely over the top and just a nice way to wrap up with the actors playing the characters as they age out of the roles they played so well.",

It has a bitter/salty yet sweet taste, and gives you the right dose of emotion and action.

Each and every wolverine movie done has him with some sorta problem with his healing factor.  They neuter him for some reason.  Wolverine without his healing factor is just some dude with claws.  What's the point?  Now in Logan, his powers are on the fritz and he's an old man.  Yeah just what I wanted to pay to see in the theatre.  Take Deadpool for example, he has a healing mutant factor, you don't see any movie with Deadpool in it with problems with his healing factor...so why do they keep doing it to the Wolverine...didn't Deadpool movies make a boat load of money?  The only redeeming quality is his daughter/female clone.  She is a better wolverine then wolverine ever was in movies, better at fighting, personality, they should've just made the movie about her instead. Though they probably neuter her too and take away her healing x factor if it came to that because they want to make a mutant movie without them having mutant powers? I dunno, so disappointed with this movie but worth the watch.  Damn I forgot, even the clone wolverine at the end was a better wolverine then the actual wolverine. They screwed up the Reavers too, they were cyborgs, half machine to mostly machines with Lady Deathstrike which she was not part of in the movie.  Hopefully Marvel's reboot into the MCU will fix the X-men and their characters.",

            "content": "Logan is the third and possibly the last movie in the Wolverine trilogy, but this film is far from the so-called \"Superhero\" genre, let alone the other movies in its own X-Men franchise. Sure, it has the good guys and the bad guys, but the tone of this film doesn't give you the feeling of excitement or satisfaction as when the main protagonist prevailed over the evil or accomplished his goal. Instead, it shows how hopeless and miserable of a situation they are in, which is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nTurning the tough and fearsome Wolverine into the old man working as a driver day by day, in the world where most of his kind are gone is a breath of fresh air, and the actor, Hugh Jackman, did a great job of portraying the emotion that the character is going through, complement with Patrick Stewart,  brilliantly playing Professor X in a shadow of his former self. It's interesting to see how their relationship has been changed from the past film, how each of them view things in a different way, how they interact or even talk to each other. It makes the movie feel more alive and real. The pace of this movie is somewhat slow, but it's in favor of making you feel more sympathetic toward the character. Throughout the film, the character development of Logan can be seen by how he slowly changes from the man that got nothing to live for to the someone that is trying to protect others, to prove to himself that there's still some good left in him. This film didn't hold back on the blood and gore part, that's why the action scene can be as brutal as it wants and made the damage done more severe than most of the other superhero movies, which make you feel and understand what the character was going through. Something that was not on a bright side is the antagonist. They are run of the mill evil corporation that does some evil things, and their goal is just getting back their escaped experiment, which is mediocre at best. Nevertheless, it's a good experience overall.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a good movie that has a different approach to this series, with the combination of good acting and great plot make this one of the best films in the X-Men franchise. But this might not be suitable for children due to the strong language they use and the visuals that make this film R-rated. All in all, it is a great way to end the series.",

The acting is superb, and Hugh Jackman gives his best portrayal of Wolverine to ever hit the screen. The entire film is very emotional, and constantly tries to jerk a tear out of your eyes. The ending is bitter-sweet, yet it leaves the audience oddly satisfied as it feels like the perfect conclusion to a franchise that has been going on sine the original \"X-Men.\" As serious as this film does get, however, there is still loads of chemistry and jokes between the three main characters (Logan, Charles Xavier, and Laura), and the movie never becomes too serious to the point of boredom. The only real issue I have with \"Logan\" is that the villain is somewhat forgettable, however, the movie is still enjoyable (albeit brutal) to watch, and it is entirely targeted towards an older audience, which I thought opened up this movie from the limitations it otherwise would have had.",

We get happy, cheer for the hero, and later forget all about it. But what if we were once told that the hero we are all cheering for is not there to stay forever? He will die, the new generation will come up, they will remember him for some years and eventually he will be forgotten until someone brings up his topic again.\nThis is exactly what happens in this movie. Unlike the high budget movies Marvel has been making like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, X-Men or Fantastic Four, this one takes place in a grim, dark near future. Everything The X-Men ever stood for has gone. Now it's just an ailing Charles Xavier and Logan, who's working as a limousine driver. They are no longer interested in the adventures they had. There was even a point where Logan sees an X-Men comic and dismisses it saying these are just fake stories. He doesn't care about a legacy, but Charles still does.\nLogan later meets his Laura, who is to be the next Wolverine. She is in trouble, and Logan must help her cross the border before they get caught. One by one Professor X, and then Wolverine, are killed to ensure his daughter and her friends are safe. The movie finally ends with a realisation that no matter what happens, the cycle of life will carry on whether it's humans or mutants. Everything that is born has to die someday. The same X-Men who we once cheered for in the movies will no longer be with us, and neither will we be to tell your tales if you keep them to yourself.",

I also love the smaller stakes; it's not this worldwide apocalypse. It's about saving a bunch of children and also family. In terms of the characters, it's heartbreaking seeing what Logan and Xavier have gone through and just seeing the struggles is so compelling. Laura is really mysterious in a good way and really kicks ass in so many sequences and I love her relationship with Xavier and Logan. The emotional beats also land hard with Xavier and Logan's death being some of the saddest deaths in a comic book movie and seeing Logan warmimg up to Laura and seeing her as his true daughter was heartwarming. Also, the last shot as we zoom into the X on Wolverine's grave is so perfect. This movie is just a masterpiece and the perfect ending to the story of the X-Men and Wolverine (And no, Dark Phoenix doesn't exist in my world).",

            "content": "The X-Men franchise has had a very inconsistent track record. From the lows of Last Stand (2006), Apocalypse (2016) and Dark Phoenix (2019) to the highs of X-Men (2000) and X2 (2004) and the wonderful rebound with First Class (2011) and Days of Future Past (2014). Needless to say, it's very variable, and often can be either: disappointing or extremely satisfying. Not many series have a reputation like X-Men, and unfortunately, many franchise seem to be more vaunted than them, as if their reputation is somehow superior. I get it, X-Men has some lows, meaning the overall quality is inconsistent, but Logan (2017) is that long-standing film that continues to show case the heights this series can achieve, especially against the overrated and craptastic MCU. And with that said, the X-Men films have had their own sequel within the franchise, obviously The Wolverine trilogy. (A series of which I've seen the 2 most latest but skipped the travesty, that I hear, is Origins). With that said, James Mangold is one of the most underrated directors of his generation, a director whose prowess has grown and matured over the years. What he achieved here with The Wolverine (2013) is yet to be matched, or that's what I originally thought. But Mangold managed to help keep the franchise alive by delivering 2 massive hits and well received films. I won't go over the plot, why should I? You watched it, right? I digress. Logan itself is why many fans have claimed, 'this is the Wolverine film I've wanted since I was a kid.' It's gory, it's violent and yet surprisingly somber and sweet. It's a patient film and it somehow brings out yet more of the political allegory that the series is praised for and keeps it fresh, yet more haunting now than ever. It's a remarkable adult film that is well needed in our times. The setting into the future is a superb choice, the opening too goes hand-and-hand to create a setting of hopeless dread. As a fellow cinemaphile, I was surprised with the opening credits; very rare for modern storytelling. The feeling alone, with it's black credits allow us (the watchers) to understand that the story being told is gonna be unlike any other in the series - which it is and the music by Marco Beltrami too world effectively. Where 'The Wolverine' setting was bright, refreshing and filled with Character, 'Logan' is polar opposite - another credit to Mangold for pulling off two vastly different films. Logan's plot is one long journey that truly captures the feeling with panache. As far as genre conventions go, it's obvious with the setting to Logan himself admitting he's poisoned that the hero's journey is all but gonna come to an end. But you'd be a damn fool to think the film is gonna be cheap and sentimental, or think the buoying of Jackman won't help keep the film afloat (luckily, it's good enough without him; he's just an added bonus). But from the death of Charles, to the revelation of the government experimentation and the sub-plot to the farm helps the story have a lot more human emotions. The father-daughter story is also very abnormal in execution for the majority of the run time, yet the ending is bitter sweet and fitting. Also, the showcasing of the X-Men being showcased in the comics shows truly a great perspective to these characters; homogenized and degraded to being sold out as marketing. Where their struggles are nothing to us, but everything to them - truly a genius and unpredictable convention that I have not seen since Unbreakable (2000). As the film progresses, the plot slowly reveals, each encounter thrillingly unpredictable, violent and not for the faint of heart. Either escaping from goons, to Charles' mind freezing everyone, to the attack on the farm, 'Logan' fires on all cylinders. The plot threads are genius, and the pacing fitting. Everything established from the beginning comes to aid everything else in the film. Jackman's performance is distraught, angry and agitated, yet never felt overbearing and felt just right in contempt. All of which is fitting and shows in the action - or should I say violence. I've always distinguished that action, is the easy accessibility to the masses while violence, often more poetic, is (often) grounded in realism or excessive to the point of being a fetish (like Tarantino, Bava and Refn). But in the end, the 'action' is superb, and definitely a step-up from The Wolverine. Along with the best elements of The Wolverine and the X-Men aspects of Logan have been brought to this finale, creating an ending usually unachievable. Logan is one of the grandest achievements for a bloated, dying genre that continues to discourage artistry and pure, unadulterated visions. Ending one of the greatest characters in cinema in fine, poetic form, to compelling storytelling, grounded in reality to resonating themes of the evils of what human atrocity can commit. Mangold's Magnum Opus is a masterpiece; a hard-hitting, stressful journey that truly resonates long after watching. Barley below Days of Future Past for me, but other than a few quarrels that happen in the film; not worth bringing up, Logan is exceptional, like the films that came in 2017.",

I think Logan works best as a stand alone feature with an alternate dark timeline. I fully can appreciate the critical acclaim this movie received, it really is incredibly well made.

By going some place new-taking a superhero film into our noir film past-AND by updating noir to a sensationally popular series-AND by bringing noir into the 21st century, this one is spectacular.

The near constant blood spray, claws through the head, and rapid stabbing was just too much, and you are constantly just waiting for and then watching the other shoe drop. I like action movies. I like X-Men. I'm no prude, but this was awful. All Logan's character says is, \"F---\" most of the time. Hey, I expect a little of that from Wolverine, but it seems as if someone decided to nix the dialogue and just say, \"yeah just throw the f-word in there 5 times and let's go home.\" His character is rough around the edges, but has enough of a redeeming quality about him. In Logan, he has a little bit of heart, but almost not enough to make you actually like him anymore. He's tired, played out, annoyingly depressing, predictable. And I get that for trying to play out his character, but it's not very fun to watch, not very entertaining, and not endearing. And the ending... I get what had to happen to our hero, but at least give us some sort of hope beyond two sticks in the ground... maybe a little Sound of Music sort of moment at the end. This is an X-Men movie, so I expected something much different... an action flick with some fun moments, a plot that has resolution at the end (or at least a hint as to what comes next), some really cool action sequences (instead of constant gore), and the Logan we all know and love. This movie, was not it. Oh and maybe, it'd be nice and hold our interest if they developed more of the mystery elements in the movie (no new mutants, what happened to all the old ones, etc.). There are a few hints, but are certainly not the focus... just a too long dirge toward the inevitable.",

While being very violent, it is absolutely not pointless \"throw it in there\" violence, and actually bolsters the plot with the use of symbolism among other techniques. Jackman himself should be commended with the highest form of praise for his stunning performance in this swan song of his most iconic character. Logan may be a dark, gritty, and bleak tale of Wolverine's final days, but it also contains a lot of heart, and in the end is about family, legacy, and finally achieving peace. And despite being a comic book movie, (even though there are several high quality comic book films nowadays) Logan is a thought-provoking, artful, and beautiful film, that defies the normal conventions of the superhero genre in the best ways. One could tell that this film was made with love for Wolverine, and love of the iconic character's fans. 5/5",

And this movie has some of the best acting in any superhero movie and that says a lot because it's been about three years since this movie has come out. This movie is loosely based on a comic called Old Man Logan I haven't read it but I heard it is good. The torment Logan goes through is so sad because the thing that has helped him for the past seventeen years is poisoning him and he doesn't heal fully from the scars. This is the only X-Men movie that has the R rating and they ride the rating to the max and it is so good. This movie does feel like a western and I really like it, and this movie has one of my favorite one on one fights in cinema.\n\nThis movie should have gotten nominated for more Oscars than just screenplay. Like the cinematography is outstanding and it looks amazing. Like I said before I loved the acting everyone does a solid job and even Dafne Keen does a good job. The CGI is very good too. The score is amazing and it elevates so many scenes and I loved the score. The sound design with all of the powers and the logans claws it sounds so good with the moments when Logan gets mad and brings his claws out sounds so good. The script is a real standout and it feels so grounded and it feels like Logan's character in the comics and it the movies. This movie has some of the best action scenes in any movie and they hold so much weight in the movie with Logan and what he is dealing with. The ending is one of my favorite endings to an on-screen character and it feels so well deserved and it is a good end to one of my favorite superheroes. I hope they do a sequel to this movie and follow the character of X-23 and not Logan and I hope they don't bring him back because it was a good end to a beloved character. I loved the story and the whole story holds so much weight to the overall universe and it is so gripping and it is so sad. Overall I absolutely loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone.\n\ud83d\udcaf%",

            "content": "The film \"Logan\" is a story that shows a deeper dynamic to our beloved character Logan, a.k.a Wolverine. From where we first started in \"X men\", we see that Hugh Jackman first took up the role as a brooding, muscular, and stubborn character. This only opened the doors for this character to grow. We see this in the many movies that happened between the first and last film. Of course there were good and bad moments we saw in the X men series, like \"Wolverine Origins\", but overall Wolverine's character made sense in the sense that all the pain that he endured traced back to the very powers he lived with. The adamantium in his body, the claws, the fast regeneration, etc shows that Logan was a man who could not be killed so easily, but was vulnerable to suffering so quickly. \n Logan's pain is why \"Logan\" is such a depressing film to watch. The fact that, as the audience, we have to see Logan get injured many times, when before it did not mean anything, impacts us at a harder level. Before Logan could take a hit and literally walk it off, but now he has to be careful in the way he fights to survive. This is where the richness in stakes are for our character's conflict, so to oppose reviews to high critics like Rex Reed who believe \"Logan\" lacks heart shows that he doesn't fully understand the background of the X men films. Even without the references to the past films, \"Logan\" still holds up on its own.",

            "content": "So finally we get an 18-rated Wolverine movie inspired by an epic comic and steered by Mangold going (yet again) Full-Western. Wolverine aka Logan aka James goes full bloody berserker many, many times, he swears, he drinks, he swears a lot and he slices and dices through human limbs, tears their faces apart and impales the bloody heck out of every bald, beard-toting cyborg.\n\nAnd then X24 turns up and we truly see an empathy-less beserker-rage-filled Wolverine, an unstoppable killing machine, we get what we want, and it's horrible, it's so horrific and heartless that we'd give anything to have broken, sad, kind-hearted, scuffed-up and ultimately soft Logan back. It's a clever sly touch to let us have our cake and eat it and it shows much of Mangold's steady eye over this film.\n\nAnd it's this use of themes that burst through the fourth wall, these not so super problems that allow us to relate to the characters and ramps up the stakes and the heart; Charles' WMD mind, he's a danger to himself and others, his degenerative brain disease mirrors the Alzheimer's that grip my grandparents and my friends family members., it's touching and truly made me laugh and cry. The Logan/Caliban odd couple thing is expertly conceived; facilitating story details and adding a dimension to the world Logan's been living in. His world smashed, his purpose lost, most of the events prior to this film are left purposely and effectively unspoken or spoken about only in passing. What little is talked about of the past is respectful, sparing and clever. It's a fusion of good cinema, good writing, good conception and execution in almost every scene.\n\nAnd the action. The R-Rated brutality is shocking but beautifully blocked, shot and cut, the effects are concrete, blood effects look like proper chunks of gore and Logan and X23 twirl and dodge and make thrilling, pulse-pounding and frightening sequences. The time freeze in the hotel with Logan tearing up the walls is a super nod to Xavier's power in X2 and mirrors Samurai/Western standoffs, with all the men collapsing at once after. Effective stuff. The fact that the car can't just snap through their own fence just works, Xavier using his powers to calm horses just works, the impromptu dinner scene just works, Laura's learning about the world just works, the cyborg hands ripped straight out of Metal Gear Solid 5 just works. It's part Collateral/late Michael Mann, part Western, and part The Last of Us. \n\nAnd it looks fucking beautiful; underrated legend John Mathieson invigorates every scene with an otherworldly fantasy-like beauty and gritty realism at the same time; his trademark which grounds the film and doesn't rely on the saturation and flat clean colours of something like Fury Road. Mangold's framing is spot on, the man knows how to compose creative and fluid scenes without imposing himself on it. And Beltrami's score is a beautiful, lyrical swansong, a different dirge that leads you to the inevitable close of the series. \n\nIt's not all roses: The Ravagers are underexplained, comically destroying villains before their master plan has been revealed is a double-edged sword in terms of effectiveness, and the use of X24 is sudden, undercooked, a little blurry and clearly messy. One wonders how well this film will fare on a second viewing which is maybe why they're plumming for the Noir version ASAP, but after Mad Max: Black & Chrome, that may not be a bad thing.\n\nBut it's a testament to Mangold's repurposing of the Western, the source material of Old Man Logan and the legacy of Singer's X-Men, and the perfect folding of these expectations together that manages to keep it constantly fresh with an edge-of-your-seat curiosity. \n\nPatrick Stewart does some of his finest work swearing and lashing out and vulnerable and bright-eyed just like most of us as our brains degenerate, Stephen Merchant brings the exact right empathy and humour, Laura is a little terror delight, not once annoying, both cute and deadly, but the star of the show is Hugh Jackman whose moving portrayal is two-fold, the actor's sadness and revelry of the role that made him as he lets it go, channeled through a guilt and remorse-ridden Wolverine who's seen it all, done worse and is ready to let go. His palpable emotion and pain are all so raw he gives his best performance since The Fountain. In what is clearly one of the best comic book movies and action movies of all time.\n\nX",

Same goes for Patrick Stewart as the iconic Professor Charles Xavier. There's times in this movie where it looked like a horror movie to me with all the slashing and blood being spilt, which is exactly what a Wolverine movie should always look like. Plus, after all these years I finally felt the rage come through the screen, and i really appreciated that. I noticed i was clenching my fists during all the fights, the blood really adds a whole new dynamic. Kinda sucks that it took the last movie to finally get it right. This really felt nothing like a superhero movie and it's all the better for it. Gonna have to pour one out for Logan. Damn, i need a hard drink after that. :'(",

The three are excellent on their own, and they only get better when paired together in sweet scenes brimming with genuine emotion.\nThe thing is, \u2018Logan' feels too distant for too long, cutting off these emotions and preventing its titular character from having a realized, fulfilling arc. All the blood and guts of the R-rated feature, while finally faithful to the character (I'm still unsure why that matters so much to a lot of people, he's been handled very well the last nineteen years), just can't make up for that. \nWhat it does do in that department is go for an incredibly on-the-nose narrative metaphor that's eye-rolling, to say the least, a trait that could be said as a whole for the somewhat (and I truly hate to use this word) pretentious screenplay and directing from James Mangold (picking the character up again from \u2018The Wolverine').

No score to be heard at that moment, because they didnt even bother to attempt to make this a scene that hits you in the feels.

Perhaps, experiences close to Logan can be found in Deadpool, taking as a point of reference its violence, savagery and brutality, which at no time is merciful to the spectator eye. It is not that one justifies violence in movies, but it is nothing new in this field, neither here nor in any other.

The girl's action scenes looked like Yoda in Attack of the Clones - flea style attack.  The plot arc was predictable, but there was enough action and emotion in it to keep it moving forward.\nBut then there were the ridiculous plot holes... I am not sure why NOW Logan starts to get old - maybe it is all the GMO corn syrup?  SPOILERS - And why, after deciding to kill the children, they do to great pains to CAPTURE them - where they could use their powers.  Or when you can TELL a child is going to use his powers, the gunman stands there looking stupid and not firing.  Or why when the children finally get 'across the border' they will be safe?  Like the baddies would leave a trail of bodies, but stop at customs?  Or even why the children were being chased at all - they supposedly were no longer needed.  Whatevs.... you get the idea.\nBad guys, despite all the blood, were not scary.  Even bizarro Logan was a letdown - who do you have the all powerful Hulk fight?  What is the only option?  Another Hulk.  Lazy.  What is the world's most dangerous profession?  Mutant hunter.  The movie might have been more interesting from the hunter's point of view.",

The plot takes place in 2029, in a rather depressing world, where the mutants almost ceased to exist, surprisingly. The elderly Logan / Wolverine makes a living as a limousine driver, dedicating his salary to the elderly and broken Professor Exavier. But one day, a mysterious woman entrusts Logan with a strange girl named Laura, who turns out to be super-strong and therefore provides an opening for hope for a different future for the mutants. Together with Lore and Professor Exbiar, Logan sets out on a journey fraught with peril, the last thing in his plans.\n\nNevertheless, Logan is a fascinating phenomenon to watch, a combination of a film of heroes and a Western, a futuristic world that seems old. A beautiful and gloomy vision that connects to the story of the redemption of a broken man who long ago gave up the hero's pattern. As with a quote from Shane, this work has never really been his. And precisely because of this, \"Logan\" is a hero film worthy of all the praise given to him!",

            "content": "Logan is a movie that will leave you speechless, from the moment it begins to the moment it ends, every aspect of the film is like a punch in the face (in the best way possible). The emotion, the tone, the aesthetic, the dialogue, the sentiment, the music, it all culminated in the best movie of all time.\n\tThe film constantly keeps an almost \"run down\" tone. Everyone is tired, everything is gloomy, and the only setting we see is the desert and a rainy cemetery. We are shown exactly what Logan is feeling, in everything that surrounds him. The only time the setting changes is when the characters are at the farm, and the end in the forest. Logan is shown to us in everything around him, and everything he does. Every decision made by the filmmakers makes sense in the best way. \n\tEvery character in the movie feels real and completely realistic. Logan is run down, but not a complete asshole. He still cares deeply for Charles, and later Laura, and is shown to be protective of the family he has found. Laura feels like a real 10 year old. She doesn't trust everyone completely, but she cares for them and forms real relationships with them. Laura's way of convincing Logan to take her to North Dakota is just repeating the names of her friends endlessly until he relents, what genius. Charles acts exactly like a grandfather, from being the one to insist to take help and get supplies, to reminiscing with Laura about old movies. The characters act like they always have, Logan is still gruff and mean, Charles is still a bit of a know it all, but they also adjust to their new environments and circumstances, and they are clearly shown to take on character traits accustomed to a father and grandfather, without ruining all the character they already had. Plus, the way Logan wears his dollar store glasses on the bridge of his nose with the tag still on as he watches a phone held a foot away from his face is so perfect, the moment that scene was shown its like, \"Yeah. That's a dad.\" \n\tThe ending itself is the most emotionally exhausting thing I've ever witnessed. The entire third act is a marathon, not a sprint. From the part at the farm house, the end of the credits, I felt like I didn't breathe. The emotion is spectacularly built, from the music to the acting to the way everything is shot. The very choice of a final villain is genius in itself. The very idea that Logan is fighting himself is obviously metaphor in itself, but one that works just way to well. But by far the best part of the third act is the performances. Never once did I question what a character was feeling, it was obvious in not only their choices, but simply their facial expressions. The scene where Logan runs back into  the house to find the clone has injured Charles and taken Laura, and he stands at the base of the steps trying to choose who to help first is INCREDIBLE. It is so easy to understand the conflict that every single character is facing. When the actual ending comes, I must say, i did sob. Not only I sob though, I was struck completely still for the entirety of the credits, quietly sobbing and barely breathing. For 24 hours after the credits ended, I was brought to tears at the very thought of the film, and couldn't bare to watch anything else. Anytime I tried watching anything else, I was struck by just the emotion of the film's end, and found myself incapable of absorbing anything else. It has been over a month, and I still can't listen to \"The Man Comes Around\" without breaking down into tears. The pure power that movie's ending alone has are amazing. In superhero movies, it is often hard to completely feel as if a character is truly dead, but Logan defies that. Teh very thought that Fox or Disney may bring Logan back makes me fill with rage. Logan's ending was the perfect ending, and nothing will ever top it.\n\tOne of the best parts of Logan is the way it completely mocks every other superhero movie ever. There's blood everywhere, everyone's cursing, dead bodies cover every inch of the ground, and no one seems completely happy after a fight. The first fight we see Logan get into doesn't show him willingly filling up with bullets, but acting almost exhausted every time a bullet enters him. Not to say he's completely bothered, in fact he only fights back when a bullet hits his rental car, which in itself is so perfect. Several scenes like this stand out, the scene where they try to run a fence down with their car but it instead just bends inward for instance is so perfect. The decision to make this movie R is one I am forever grateful for. The very idea of making a movie like this PG makes me want to laugh. The blood, the cursing, the violence, it's all so perfect.\n\tOverall Logan is a movie that takes everything that was set up for it and says \"screw that\". It is almost separated from its franchise, its rating cuts out like half of its optimal audience, and introduces a new main character that no one knows and is a ten year old girl who never speaks. This movie should have failed, but instead it became when of the most memorable movies of the decade, and by far the best the superhero genre has to offer. The superhero movie for every person who hates superhero movies if you will. \n",

Everything about this story is sad other than the teeny ray of hope in the future of the little Wolverine girl, who is essentially Logan's daughter. Spoiler: Logan freakin DIES at the end. Professor X DIES in the fucking middle. Nearly all of our X-friends are DEAD before the story begins, and our remaining heroes are living a really sad existence hiding out in a southern U.S. border wasteland, and it appears MAGA-country is in full desolate effect in what must be about 10-15 years from now, replete with a crumbling American infrastructure, economic collapse, rampant crime, wars and limos of fratboys hurling racist bullshit at weathered immigrants languishing in INS detention camps.

Even more impressive is the fact that a kid actress is one of the leading roles and she does an exceptional job without even speaking for most of the movie. It also is well-deserving of its R rating as it is incredibly vulgar and violent. What keeps it from being one of the best comic book movies ever though is the slow middle act of the film.

So, bear in mind that I watched this cold, without much awareness of the X-Men backstory (apart from anything I may have gleaned from looking at other kids' comics during summer camp in the 1970s) - your mileage may vary.  Of course, setting aside some of the supernatural elements, the film can be read as the story of an aging and disillusioned man, potentially dying of some unknown illness, drowning himself in drink and drugs, but then called upon to assist in a moral imperative whereupon he rediscovers an important part of himself and/or his deeper values.  This may not be Joseph Campbell's hero's journey but it is certainly a story arc we have seen before.  The fact that it is a child who brings the hero to his senses is also familiar.  So, adding the supernatural elements to the mix may be what has refreshed it.  In this version, the weary old man (Logan; Hugh Jackman) has razor sharp adamantium claws and the young child is a new mutant developed from his genetic material (played by Dafne Keen) who sports the same weapons.  She has escaped from the facility that created her (run by Richard E. Grant) and needs Logan to help her to escape to \"Eden\" located on the Canadian border.  It is a long way from the Mexican border - especially with X-Men leader Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), now 90 years old, and experiencing seizures that can kill others, in tow.  There are some military-styled bad guys to fight along the way and the film earns its R-rating for violence.  The final fight, in a North Dakotan forest reminiscent of the setting (and moves?) for the Six Million Dollar Man vs. Bigfoot, feels old-school rather than CGI, which I appreciated. And it was hard not to identify with a grumbly superhero who wears reading glasses!  This said, I'm not sure I need to watch anything else from this franchise.",

In fact, my three favorite superheroes had to have been Spider-Man, Batman and, of course, you might have guessed, Wolverine.  I think Venom and Beast were a notch below that to close out my top five as a kid.  I dressed up as Batman AND as Wolverine as a child.  I don't remember dressing up as a Spider-Man, but I may have worn a mask or two.  I don't think my fandom of these three heroes shaped my childhood as much as The Simpsons did, which I also grew up loving, but I do have very fond memories of my time spent with these heroes and their stories.  Fast-forward to 2000 and the original X-Men movie comes out which, as far as I can remember, is the first Marvel movie to, you know, be any good.  There was a 1989 Punisher with Dolph Lundgren that, apparently, was not very good (depending who you ask).  A year a later the first Captain America movie came out and it was somehow even worse than the Punisher.  At the time DC was killing it with Burton's first Batman film, so Marvel was playing catch-up in terms of quality.  So, really, at the time X-Men came out, it was kind of the saving grace for Marvel.  It allowed them to successfully transition most, if not all (early-to-mid 2000s Daredevil, Elektra come to mind immediately, of their heroes to commercially and critically successful movies.  I'm not saying that without X-Men's success that the MCU would not have existed, but it certainly made it more viable than it was prior to X-Men's release.  2003 saw the release of X2, which was, at the time, one of the best superhero movies ever made.  The end for the original X-Men film trilogy, obviously, came with The Last Stand, which wasn't that good.  The franchise, after The Last Stand, needed rebooting and, in 2009, came the first Wolverine movie.  I remember really hating this movie with a passion.  Like I loathed it, I remember being really fucking pissed off at how much of a joke Gambit was made out to be, particularly considering the potential that character had to be really fucking cool.  Moving on from that flick, we got X-Men: First Class in 2011 and Days of Future past in 2014, which were both great.  On the Wolverine front however, in terms of standalone films, we got The Wolverine in 2013.  This brings us to 2017's Logan, the film that brings us together and the film that serves as Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman's final acts as Professor Charles Xavier and Logan/Wolverine, respectively.  A lot has been said about this movie, with some even regarding it as one of the finest superhero movies ever made.  A movie that defies the typical conventions associated with the genre to create something meaningful, with strong characters you care about and surprising emotional depth.  And with that, I must say that this movie is quite unlike every superhero movie I've ever seen.  It's not about Thanos killing all life on earth with this Infinity Stones.  It's not about the Joker causing chaos in Gotham.  It's not about Doctor Octopus causing havoc in New York and Spider-Man protecting its good citizens from a madman.  This movie is about one man saving his soul by helping Laura, a girl created from is DNA by this biotechnology company intent on, of course, creating soldiers from scratch, cross the border into Canada to, hopefully, find a safe haven there.  It's about Logan's slow deterioration.  He still heals, but it's not nearly as effective as it used to be anymore and he's in constant pain, so he's turned to alcohol as a painkiller.  His abilities are nowhere near as good as they used to be either.  One of the many things that I like about this movie is the fact that Logan carries the weight of everything that has happened to him.  Not just in terms of all the battles he's fought, the wars he's been in.  I mean the loss of his friends, as him, Xavier and Caliban, officially, are the last X-Men alive.  The movie takes place in 2029, 25 years after the birth of the last mutant.  The same biotechnology company that is creating these mutant children from scratch are also the ones, whose experiments, responsible for, essentially, exterminating the mutants, as it were.  As far as Charles Xavier is concerned, however, much like Logan, his health has deteriorated to the point that he is not the same.  You see, Xavier suffers from a form of dementia that, without medication, causes some severe seizures that leaves anyone in the vicinity suffering from temporary paralysis.  If it goes on long enough, people could actually die.  With that said, there was an incident prior to the film's events where Xavier suffered one of these seizures that injured hundreds and killed seven of the other X-Men.  None are ever named and this incident is only talked about in the movie, it is never shown.  And that's what I love about this world, the actions of the past have relevance to what we are seeing now, as it should be.  The reason I mention that is because it adds to the feeling that this world existed prior to us joining Logan for his last journey.  Xavier's last incident forces Logan to hide Xavier in Mexico and having Caliban look after him in this abandoned smelting plant.  Logan and Xavier have suffered the consequences of their actions and you can see it in the body language they display and their attitude towards each other.  Logan and Xavier have a more antagonistic relationship than they ever have in the past, but that's as a result of the past and I do think the movie does a great job of that.  In spite of them not showing you anything of what happened to Logan and Xavier in the time since we last saw them, you know that they've been struggling.  Emotionally and physically.  This opens the door to explore some different angles to tell a story within the context of a superhero movie.  To say that this movie is more like a noir western than it is a superhero movie is kind of an understatement.  To the point that the Blu-Ray DVD (that I own) includes a disc where there's a black and white version of the movie.  And the film wears its western influences on its sleeves, quite openly.  But it uses those influences to craft a new story, something unprecedented in the superhero world.  The characters, more than any other film in this genre that I've seen, drive the narrative forward.  It's not the action, it's not the special effects.  It's the actors and their performances that carry the movie forward.  This is a fantastic movie  by any standard, it's not JUST a great superhero movie.  And that's something that a lot of the films in the MCU fail to achieve.  They're great superhero movies, period.  And I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that that means that a lot of these movies end up playing it safe in terms of its approach they take to the visual and narrative aspects of their films.  That's a major problem the MCU has faced throughout their ten years of existence.  Visually and thematically, the MCU have got this homogenized look and feel and, never, has anyone sort of ventured from that.  I love Black Panther and it is, quite possibly, the best film in the MCU yet (and one of the best of last year thanks to its thoughtful narrative), but it still fits within that mold that Marvel has created.  It doesn't really attempt to explore new avenues to tell a story that are not associated with the genre.  There's no real attempts to, truly, transcend the genre like, really, only one film has done.  That film is, obviously, The Dark Knight.  This movie is the other.  And, if I'm being honest, I find that this movie even goes farther than The Dark Knight ever did in terms of pushing the genre past its normal boundaries.  It still very much feels like a superhero movie pushed to its extreme, in a good way.  But Logan manages to avoid those pitfalls and, essentially, tell sort of a survivalist/road trip/western/noir film, where the characters at its core as the most important tenet to carry its narrative forward.  Even The Dark Knight still revolves around the Joker threatening to destroy Gotham and causing untold amounts of destruction, injuring thousands of nameless and, mostly, faceless people.  This movie is about two men, Logan and Charles, helping this girl reach a safe haven for mutants, all children like her, across Canada.  And, of course, they're also on the run from Alkali Transigen, the company that created Laura from Logan's DNA.  There's no threat to the universe, the threat is to Laura and the rest of the mutant children that Alkali was hoping to turn into soldiers, the threat is to Logan's sou; as, again, he's been broken  by everything that he's gone through.  I love that stripped down approach.  It tells personal story, more so than any superhero film ever made.  Black Panther is the only thing that comes close.  I love Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Logan, he is tremendous here.  He is a man who, and this is a trait Wolverine has had throughout the franchise, of now knowing who he is.  He, even at this point in his life, hasn't found who he is as a result of how he was created and what he was created for.  I think that's a theme that carries heavily throughout the film and something that Logan tells Laura at the end of the film, that she shouldn't be what they made him to be.  I do think that Logan struggles with that daily and, again, it's one of the many things in his life that has led him to the point he is in this film, a broken-down, bitter and angry Wolverine.  Same thing with Patrick Stewart, who captures the fragility of a 90-year-old Xavier perfectly with his performance.  Dafne Keen, as X-23 or Laura, is a great addition to the franchise and her performance as this character doesn't feel forced, because she has the perfect angry face to pull off, quite literally, a mini-Wolverine.  She's kind of a badass and some of the best action scenes in the entire film are X-23's.  But, at the same time, the movie doesn't forget that she's still an eleven-year-old girl (I wonder if this was a Stranger Things nod) and they do try to showcase that in some of her later interactions with Logan.  I suppose we need to talk about the action now and, quite frankly, it is tremendous and brutal.  That's the best way to describe it, but in its own context of course, it feels believable, there's nothing cartoonish about it.  Its level of violence might be off-putting to some, but I think it helps the world feel more real, feel more threatening.  In short, it should be obvious, that I fucking loved this movie.  If there is a flaw, and there is one, is that I do think the pacing could have used some tightening up.  Other than that, however, this is still a tremendous movie.  Easily one of the best movies in the genre and, really, only the second one that manages to transcend the genre's limitations to become something more, something different and unique that has never been seen before in this genre.  Is it the best superhero movie I've ever seen?  Honestly, I don't know.  I'll have to watch The Dark Knight again in order to properly decide, but this is an easy recommendation.  Phenomenal movie and a fantastic send-off to a character that we've known and loved for almost 20 years.\n\nAs a bit of an side, I imagine this is like a postscript, I have to talk about 20th Century Fox's merger with Disney and what that means for Deadpool and the X-Men film franchise.  Look, I've enjoyed most movies in the MCU, but they all do kinda look and feel the same, which I mentioned in this review.  And I'm worried that that's what they're gonna do with Deadpool and the X-Men.  20th Century Fox's handling of these franchises, X-Men most specifically, has not been perfect.  But I also have to give credit where credit is due, Simon Kinberg and his team have been the only ones to truly take risks on behalf of Marvel.  If Disney owned the rights to the Deadpool character from the start, we wouldn't get those two great movies that we got.  We would get something resembling that, but far more family-friendly.  Family-friendly is fine, but there needs to be something edgier and Deadpool offers that in spades.  Logan would be absolutely nerfed and censored by Disney in order for it to ensure a PG-13 rating, completely draining it of its essence.  And that's what I'm worried is gonna happen now that these characters, seem, to be reverting back to Marvel.  What does that mean for Deadpool?  Disney does have Buena Vista and they COULD release the sequels under that banner and still keep it R-rated.  But I don't think Disney is gonna wanna do that, I think they're gonna wanna strip Deadpool of his personality and have him fit into the mold that they've created and perfected.  I'm not saying it wouldn't be cool to see Deadpool interact with some of the members of the MCU, but if that means completely destroying the character's essence, then I don't care for that.  There's enough characters in the X-Men universe for him to interact with.  As far as what that means for taking risks, I do not know.  Deadpool has already been established as a foul-mouthed and violent mercenary.  It's kind of difficult to go back on that if Disney fully takes over.  But with a movie like The New Mutants, which hasn't been released yet, and serves as the thirteenth installment of the X-Men franchise, I wonder they don't fuck with that movie.  It's a HORROR movie in the superhero genre, I mean that's something fresh and I would wish that Disney would take wild risks like this with its characters, but they don't.  Because that's not a guaranteed over half-a-billion worldwide gross.  Disney does what is going to earn them the most money and horror isn't gonna make them the most money when compared to, yet, another homogenized entry in the MCU.  I don't think any self-respecting fan of the genre wants that.  Again, I've enjoyed MANY films in the MCU, but they're all very similar thematically and tonally.  I just hope that this doesn't mean the end of risk-taking for superhero genre as a whole.  I mean we have the DCEU and I guess there's hope in them using their standalone movies to try some new ideas, but it's something that we're gonna have to wait and see.  Oh, and before I end this, I forgot to give props to James Mangold's excellent script and direction.  Props to you and everyone involved in the making of this wonderful film.",

They did put advanced tech in it, but they didn't literally shove it in our faces. I felt teary for the ending. When watching the movie expect tears. This is a gory movie, like Deadpool level gore.

Wolverine films to date, although enjoyable on the whole, have lacked the sheer brutality required to do adequate justice to the story of Logan, and have left many fans feeling somewhat flat - but no less enamoured with Jackman's embodiment of the character.\n\nIn undertaking an adaptation of the \"Old Man Logan\" storyline from the comics, Mangold faced a huge task to faithfully portray this savage narrative, but handled it with ridiculous aplomb, creating a defining film to send off the character with a stunning crescendo. In Dafnee Keen, a new star was born amidst the slashed bodies and dismembered limbs. She truly rose above the chaos to all but steal the show from Jackman. Patrick Stewart bid farewell to his beloved Charles Xavier in another remarkable performance. The acting was quite simply, sublime, the pacing was perfection, the canon was honoured, and the production was fitting. What more is there to say? Make no mistake about it, this film deserves to be ranked amongst all films, not just the sub-genre of comic book adaptations. Ranked highly indeed. 4/5 (yes, it was THAT good)",

            "content": "For the most part, superhero movies are family friendly romps that eventually end with a final battle being won by the good guy. Logan takes the many tropes of past superhero films and changes the narrative completely. Not only is the R rating strife for coarse language and savage violence throughout the film, but it also allows us to see a truly gritty version of Hugh Jackman's iconic portrayal of the Marvel antihero. Loosely following the narrative in the Old Man Logan storyline in the comics, we are thrust into a world where mutants are on a severe decline in numbers. This is due to a massive event involving Professor X developing seizures that cause intense moments of paralysis and eventually death and also the result of experimentation and disease created by various corporations wanting to expel the mutant race or create super soldiers for personal and national gain. These same super soldiers, mere children scientifically and genetically modified within kidnapped Mexican teenagers, are the crust of this film. In the year 2025, Logan has attempted to disappear with Professor X in Mexico. However, Logan needs to make money in order to sustain any type of lifestyle and to keep up the inventory of prescription drugs that are needed to quell the seizures that Charles suffers from and also to diminish his psychic abilities. During this time, he is discovered by a woman attempting to flee with one of the aforementioned mutant children. This child just so happens to be the iconic X-23, a hybrid mutant that shares a genetic code with Wolverine himself. With her dual claws coming out of her knuckles and a defensive claw in her feet, she is a formidable killer. Add on her severe anger issues, a la Wolverine himself, and you have yourself one of the most deadly creatures ever. Witnessing their journey from Texas to the Canadian border, dealing with the ever present threat of the pursuing Reavers and the manufactured monster X-24, the fear of Professor X's seizures occurring and causing widespread chaos and death and of course just the volatile relationship the 2 clawed mutants share, we are taken on a journey that threatens to change how we see superhero movies and how we feel about these characters. The truly epic deaths of both Professor X and Logan are heart-wrenching and leave you with a near empty feeling going forward. This film is amazing and needs to be seen by absolutely everyone. X-23 is masterfully portrayed by Dafne Keen and I would not be surprised if this character is continued on with her at the helm and the other mutant children playing important roles as well, both as heroes and villains.",

Full commitment. The whole cast is quite good, with Patrick Stewart bringing a tremendous amount of extra weight to the film, and newcomer Dafne Keen knocking it out of the park. Very interested to see where her career goes. The movie has its weak elements, CGI work is pretty bad in parts, and the plot is a bit derivative. Seeing the gruff protagonist escort a child through a dangerous landscape isn't exactly new, we even had a pretty similar sub-plot in the new Planet of the Apes movie this year.

The Logan/Laura relationship is just a pale repeat of the far better developed father-daughter relationship between Rogue and Logan in the first X-Men movie. X-24, the \"evil\" version of Wolverine, is a second rate rip off of Liev Shrieber's Victor Creed from Wolverine: Origins. Zander Rice, the evil scientist who hates mutants, is just a poor man's version of William Stryker. The Munsons are a recycling of the Hudsons from Wolverine: Origins. Both are kindly farm families who try to help Wolverine and end up getting killed by the bad guys. The whole plot of Logan is just a retread of the plot from The Wolverine--Logan loses his powers and mourns dead X-Men. The ONLY good thing about this movie is Patrick Stewart, and his character's death is really pointless and pathetic. This  movie was a disappointment to me, big time!",

            "content": "Making the most out of a Hard-R rating and a career-best lead performance, this violent but thought-provoking kitty definitely has claws when it comes to closing out the most popular X-Man's run with a blockbusting but altogether satisfying bang. In this R-rated future-set actioner, a weary Logan (Hugh Jackman) cares for an ailing Professor X (Patrick Stewart), but their attempts to hide from the world and their legacies get upended when a young mutant arrives (Dafne Keen), pursued by dark forces.\n\nFrom the opening scene, this very loose adaptation of the \"Old Man Logan\" storyline from the Wolverine comic series doesn't shy away from body counts or subverting superhero movie tropes. In fact, in this world-weary future, the only recognizable things are Logan and Professor Charles Xavier. With Logan, the X-Men franchise and its extensions have jumped ahead many years without fully explaining the Hows and Whys. Not connecting these dots proves far more intriguing as it gives the tone and setting a nebulousness akin to a certain classic trilogy of Spaghetti westerns where the main character has no name. Set in a really down and dirty time for mutants, itself very western-esque, both of these characters are very blue in two very different manners--emotionally and filthily. This is to say, it's a downbeat landscape in which most of mutantkind has been wiped out and this depression manifests itself in the form of many F-Bombs and obscene shouting matches. While working 'blue' would seem to fit Logan's curmudgeonly persona like a glove, moviegoers will be surprised how well it suits the typically do-gooding Prof. X as well. What results is a road movie that allows each character to show a decent amount of heart as these two aging meta-humans undergo a lot of human changes. Oh, there are blood, guts, and set pieces aplenty but this is the most adult extension of the X-franchise for other reasons. Indeed, even set in a latter-day dystopia, this is the most grounded of X-Men outings because our heroes ultimately face off with their own mortality. At times head-turning and heart-wrenching in the same scene, this swan song goes for broke in all of the best ways.\n\nMind you, Logan won't win awards for its dialogue (as much as the story isn't typical, the lines are oftentimes downright pedestrian) but it's still a comic book movie at heart and comic book movies aren't striving for David Mamet diction to sell through the plot. And what a plot it is. The fact that writer-director James Mangold (who shares screenwriting credit with Scott Frank and Michael Green) even positioned this as the final go-round for fan favorite Wolverine - or that Fox greenlit it - amounts to shear bravery (what was borrowed and built upon from the comic book alone deserves plaudits). Just listen to the summary: A graying and wrinkled Agent X drops F-Bombs and aggressors while navigating a very pessimistic western landscape with his old boss and a young girl who just might be the world's most powerful mutant. Such a bold move sounds more like stupidity as opposed to bravery but the end result is brilliantly executed. Hugh Jackman has played this role 8 times before but here, he is free to color outside of the lines. Lived-in at this point, he stretches Logan's skin to a ridiculously nuanced degree--never to the point of feeling false though. Likewise, Patrick Stewart gives a supporting turn that breaks the heart but also feels quite appropriate. Heath Ledger received an Oscar posthumously for his performance as the Joker, proving that comic book characters are worthy of H'Wood gold. Jackman and Stewart very much earn their tears as well. \n\nTo Sum It All Up: Truth and Claw",

            "content": " It's disheartening that it took 17 years, numerous movies and Hugh Jackman's retirement from the character to finally get Wolverine right, but at least they finally did. James Mangold, who brought \"The Wolverine\" to the screen and attempted to get the \"Japanese\" Wolverine storyline to film, did an admirable job, especially compared to the disastrous \"Wolverine: Origins,\" getting much of the mood and characters correct, namely Silver Samurai, but the grittiness, realism and story-heavy \"Logan\" is a Christopher Nolan-worthy quality film that puts it in Top 5 all-time Super Hero movie status. What a one one which Hugh and Patrick chose to retire. Talk about going out on a high. The movie never misses a beat. While I haven't read \"Old Man Logan,\" much of this film appears to be taken from that storyline. The 13 year-old me couldn't believe I was watching a film with Caliban in it, played by the masterful Stephen Merchant, which inevitably led to me spending a long amount of time explaining to my boys who Caliban was, his role in the Morlocks, early X-Factor comics and how some of those elements came across in both \"X-Men: Apocalypse\" and now \"Logan.\" This is the Wolverine movie everyone deserved and, with the aid of the popularity of \"Deadpool,\" we finally got it. That is, we got the true berserker, violent wolvie we'd been craving. I always thought it was odd that Wolverine primarily used these indestructible claws and his rage as a means to a violent end, yet in few comics (at least back in the day) and never in movies, did we get to actually SEE those claws and rage translate into pure violence. \"Logan\" fixed that. However, it wouldn't have been worth seeing without the context of the now-well-developed character Hugh Jackman's been perfecting all these 17 years. \"Logan\" was the perfect merger of storytelling, direction, acting and...timing. Without spoiling, I've always been fascinated with what comic book characters could actually seem interesting on screen. When I was a kid, just about everything Frank Miller touched, both with art and story, turned to gold. It shouldn't surprise me then that the characters with which he struck that gold have become the richest characters in film. From the \"Return of the Dark Knight\" series, we got Christopher Nolan's brilliant take on Batman. From his stint on \"Daredevil\" and specifically the death of Elektra and stories with The Punisher, we got the brilliant Netflix show. And, finally, from his beautiful limited series set in Japan, we have Wolverine. My generation loves these characters because of Frank Miller. Sure they had some level of popularity before and after, but the rich film-quality layers of these characters comes from the era when Frank Miller wrote and drew them. I'm fascinated that 30+ years later, they are coming to life in that same glory onscreen. That being said, \"Logan\" was a death, both literally and figuratively. In \"Old Man Logan,\" I too felt old. I felt like, with the advent of Deadpool, Cable, The New Mutants, etc., the generation these movies had been made for since the first X-Men in 2000, might be at its end. Yes, we still have \"Avengers: Infinity War\" upon us in 2018, but with the contracts of many of those Marvel Avengers, and the retirement of Hugh and Patrick, my time as a deep lover of these films may be coming to a close. Of course, what a way to go out though. \"Logan\" is a strong character-driven masterpiece of comic book literature that also happens to be violent. For lovers of all of these characters, \"Logan,\" like \"Deadpool\" is proof you can stick to source material when translating to film without dumbing them down for mass audiences. There are enough of us old fans to bring ourselves, our children, etc. to support the correct translation of these characters to film. I just hope Fox remembers that when they try and reboot Fantastic Four again. As much as it may not be diverse, Johnny Storm was the Causcasian brother of Sue. Not the African-American brother of adopted sister Sue. Stop fucking with the source material and make the films we, the fans, have wanted to see. No, Dr. Doom isn't a wise-cracking asshole like in the first two Fantastic Four films. Elektra isn't a spoiled rich Anglo girl, like she was in the Elektra movie. And I won't even approach how messed up they got Suicide Squad, Ghost Rider and the movie versions of Punisher. When done the way they had always been written, these stories come alive and please the long-suffering fans. The trend is heading upward, just as the use of popular storylines seem to be drying up. I'm glad I'm alive to enjoy them while they are here.",

Oh, and it's also Wolverine and I've been in love with this series since I was 14 years old.  Now there is no denying that of the NINE times Hugh Jackman has appeared as Wolverine, some movies have worked better than others.  Regardless of that fact I have been excited for all of them, perhaps however not since the first movie came out 18 years ago have I so eagerly anticipated an X-men movie. Earlier this year Kieth Freeman had a great breakdown, but now with about a year of hindsight, I'll say that Logan is objectively one of the greatest comic book adaptations ever translated to film.

Performances from Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are outstanding, and have nothing to do with portraying a superhero, but rather the emotional mechanisms (ferocity, comedy, reticence) used to deal with loyalty in the face of frustration, weariness, and tragedy.  That said, there is also a story about Logan bonding with a young girl which is quite touching.  Her character is a refreshing new entry into the X-men pantheon.  Finally there is a plot driven by the machinations of a morally corrupt biotech-weapons corporation, which is as compelling as one could expect from any top-notch Marvel movie.

            "content": "To summarize, I quite liked the beginning of this movie but it didn't really materialize into a cohesive story. It set the scene of the desert well, and presents a grim picture of the mutant situation in the near future. Speaking of \"near future\", this is not the only \"meta\" tie-in since the film also features X-men comic books as a motif. The story is still flowing well when the main villain is introduced along with the premise for the conflict. However it was during the first big action scene that I started to lose my sense of immersion. The main reason was excess brutality/evil-ness. To be clear, I don't have a problem with violence in all cases. Actually, I really enjoyed a lot of the acrobatic combat - the claws through the head, somersaults, and all that. That kind of violece is justified by the story - war is war, and it's more about flawless execution than moral quandries. It's those situations that prompt the viewer to think \"why would they do that? it's so evil\" that bother me. Even those parts aren't necessarily bad, for example I thought the scene showing the kids in the laboratory was quite effective, because the violece was implied and imagined. Even if it's only implied, though, the violence itself isn't the plot - it's only a means to an end. What I mean by that is that the viewer can usually assume there's some reason behind the violence - some tricky moral question that we end up asking outselves. That way we as viewers resound with the characters as they respond to these same questions. However, in Logan, this 'bigger picture' is often missing. We're repeatedly showing evil characters doing evil things, but don't really get any reason to give them sympathy. Also, the plot in the later part of the movie is a little eye-roll inducing ... the whole 'passing on to the next generation' thing is just a little too obvious, and suddently the protagonists are kids who are definitely not old enough to watch a rated R movie - why?",

The LOGAN film has ruined all the work done up to this point and damaged the image of the X-Saviour and Wolverine characters, which are the pillars of the X-Men story. It's an unecessary violent film with flying heads and blood spillages. The dark atmosphere creates stress and desolation. X-Saviour becomes an imbecile and Wolverine a pathetic old man. This is an insult to the X-Men tradition and, as a fan, who has watched all the original cartoon series and read the comics, I feel sad that such an indecent movie has been made to close the X-Men saga.

Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. I could intellectually understand what was the reasoning for this or that, but I barely felt any emotional connection to what was happening.\n\nThe plot was as simple as they come. Nothing new in that department, besides the absolutely shattered status of the X-Men which is kind of an interesting idea. The actual plot though is just standard. This movie heavily relies on its character study of old man Logan and a bit of old geriatric man Xavier. Both of them were done well. The claws action was visceral and intense. The makeup was great.\n\nMy problems are these;\nMeandering action sequences (the first one with all the cars outside of Xavier's hideout).\n\nBaffling character choices that don't make sense (tagging along with the black family).\n\nForced subversion during Xavier's burial scene (it's an intriguing idea on paper, but it was executed a little bit clumsily, not elegant at all and I didn't felt the movie earned that kind of treatment of Xavier).\n\nWeak finale with all the powerful mutant kids barely putting up a fight and weirdly abandoning Logan to fight by himself while Laura went ham (we didn't see anything about Laura being especially trained in combat, so I assume that the rest also went through combat training).\n\nUnremarkable cinematography, very run of the mill scene compositions and framing. Felt like a tv show, barely felt like a movie.\n\nLaura's hamfisted perfect recitation of the old cowboy movie monologue she somehow managed to fully memorize after one viewing. Didn't know her power was perfect memory. It was one of those \"kid movie talks like an adult\" movie syndromes.\n\nThe stupid Donald character that didn't deserve to be in as much of this movie as he was.\n\nThis movie was fine, I didn't suffer, but it did bug me that this movie was being talked about as an A++ movie, when it was simply an above average superhero movie.",

            "content": "Rejoice, it took a Deadpool to lift the Wolverine movies' curse!\nLOGAN \nThis movie is quite... peculiar. Whether in its approach, techniques or themes, it's not what you'd expect from this genre, and specially for the X-Men franchise which, for me, is not a very successful one when it comes to quality. Though I consider that Days of Future Past is the best X-Men movie so far, mainly for being able to balance a vast array of characters in a intricate plot, this is a clear second place (Deadpool being third - watch it carefully and you'll know why) . Logan is gritty to its core, its well scored and cast, and the CGI blends seamlessly to the film. The action scenes aren't free of the over-cutting syndrome of superhero movies, but still it's the best direction that the character has received. I really wasn't that keen on Wolverine before and now I understand it was the way he was being treated that caused me discomfort. And make no mistake, the R rating is the main propeller of this shift in how the character is portrayed. It's fabulously satisfying to see violence in all its gore as when Logan rips the guts out of people, we see those guts, which makes a huge difference in a directorial point of view, as the constraints to stage and cut around what's explicit are out of questions. And we do have to thank Deadpool for this, as it opened the way for R-rated superhero movies (basically, it took Ryan Reynolds to show that 9/11 happened and we're big boys now, we can take a little blood). Also, the script is as sharp as his claws, which contributes to the tonal focus that is very indicative of Eastwood's westerns, which is further pursued by the crisp cinematography and color pallet, very reminiscent of Hell or High Water and many others that have come before. That ultimately adheres to the movie so intrinsically that it doesn't seem to fit in the superhero genre. Though, it has a rushed ending and a minor lack of total payoff, it's very bizarre to have such a good movie this early in the year and it's specially impactful to bring something new to a increasingly saturated genre. SPOILER (BUT NOT REALLY) \nI also thought it was very relevant that this is the first \"superhero\" movie with such an emotional and mature theme. In the end, it's no spoiler to say that this film is about ending. Ending a cycle, ending a character's life, while still maintaining hope as driving force. Hope is what gets the movie from A to B, even if B is where you say goodbye. More than an actor parting from a character that he has inhabited, this movie is a film elegy. It's a gore-filled poem on how we grow and how we stage a farewell...",

Marvel has already  alienated their comic readers with their stupid sjw-agenda. Beloved super heroes have been gradually replaced with gays, lesbos, disabled, kneegrows and spics - and the sales are on an all time low, because people obviously just do NOT want this type of social \"justice\" brainwashing - fact! \nNow Marvel is trying to apply this formula to the Wolverine franchise and the result is as predictable as it could be: Xavier is killed off, Logan is killed off and replaced by a - surprise! - beaner chick - srsly Marvel?!?   -.- \n\nI, for my part, will turn my back to yet another franchise, yet another movie company.

Hugh Jackman has been doing this shit for 17 years and has the greatest payoff he could've, and did, ask for...An R-Rated, gritty, violent approach on The Wolverine...With an amazing final story and spectacular screen writing. The script was so good it was nominated for best adapted screenplay. The performances were superb as well, with Patrick Stewart pulling the performance of his career as Xavier in this film. He was also the biggest oscar snub of 2018 easily...This film is a cinematic masterpiece and probably one of my favorite films of all time. It's hard to explain how great this movie is without seeing it yourself...So go watch it!! #1 X-Men movie of all time.\n I'll give it \n         - 98%",

That farm family murder was sad and shocking to watch.\n\nThe action is what you'd expect in an R rated Wolverine flick: chock full of bloody slicing and dicing galore.

Logan's (Hugh Jackman) healing ability has weakened and he has aged; he spends his days drinking and working as a limo driver in El Paso, Texas. In an abandoned smelting plant in northern Mexico, he and mutant tracker Caliban (Stephen Merchant) care for nonagenarian Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Logan's mentor and founder of the X-Men. Charles, a psychic, suffers from a brain disease that causes him to have destructive seizures unless controlled with medication; a seizure a year earlier killed seven mutants, leaving Logan, Caliban and Xavier as the last of the X-Men. Gabriela Lopez, a former nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, tries to hire Logan to escort her and an 11-year-old girl, Laura (Dafne Keen), to Eden, a refuge in North Dakota. Logan reluctantly accepts, but finds Gabriela killed. He is confronted at his hideout by Gabriela's killer Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), Transigen's cyborg chief of security, who is looking for Laura. Laura has stowed away in Logan's limo, and has powers like Logan's. She, Logan, and Charles escape Pierce and his Reavers, but Caliban is captured and tortured by Pierce into tracking Laura. A video on Gabriela's cellphone shows that Transigen created Laura and other children from mutant DNA samples to turn into weapons. Laura was created from Logan's DNA. As they proved difficult to control and Transigen had found an alternative, the children were to be killed, but Gabriela and other nurses helped some of them escape. In Oklahoma City, Logan discovers that Eden appears in an X-Men comic in Laura's possession and assumes it is fictional. The Reavers arrive, but Charles has a seizure and incapacitates everyone in the vicinity except for Logan and Laura, who kill the attackers and inject Charles with his medication. As they flee, Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant), head of Transigen, arrives to help Pierce...\n\nLogan premiered at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival on February 17, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 3, 2017, in IMAX and standard formats. The film was critically acclaimed, with praise for its performances (particularly those of Jackman, Stewart, and Keen), screenplay, direction, action scenes, tone, and themes; critics considered it a departure from traditional superhero movies. The film became one of the best-reviewed films in the X-Men series, with some critics considering it one of the best superhero films of all time, was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2017, and received a nomination for the Best Adapted Screenplay at the 90th Academy Awards, making it the first live action superhero film to receive a screenplay nomination. A commercial success, it grossed over $616 million worldwide against its $97 million budget, making it the fourth highest-grossing R-rated film of all-time behind Deadpool, The Matrix Reloaded and It.\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Hugh Jackman makes the most of his final outing as Wolverine with a gritty, nuanced performance in a violent but surprisingly thoughtful superhero action film that defies genre conventions.\" Some reviewers noted Logan as one of the greatest superhero films of all-time. Scott Collura of IGN gave Logan a score of 9.7/10, and called the film, \"an emotional, heavy picture, but it's also an uplifting one that reminds us that it's okay to fight for something more, something better,\" and \"perhaps the best X-Men movie yet.\" A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film an 'A-', and said \"[the film] manages to deliver the visceral goods, all the hardcore Wolverine action its fans could desire, while still functioning as a surprisingly thoughtful, even poignant drama-a terrific movie, no 'comic-book' qualifier required.\" Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'B-', and called it \"both the most violent film in the series and the most sentimental one. When it's not showering you in blood, it's trying to make you spill tears.\" Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter reacted positively, saying: \"Seamlessly melding Marvel mythology with Western mythology, [director] James Mangold has crafted an affectingly stripped-down standalone feature, one that draws its strength from Hugh Jackman's nuanced turn as a reluctant, all but dissipated hero.\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave it 4/5, stating \"It is more like a survivalist thriller than a superhero film, and signals its wintry quality with the title itself\" and compared Wolverine's hitting of his truck during the film to Basil Fawlty from Fawlty Towers. James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave it 3.5/4 and said, \"In terms of tone and content, Logan is Deadpool's polar opposite but both productions refuse to play by traditional superhero movie rules ... With his glimpse into what superhero movies can be, James Mangold has given us something sadly lacking in recent genre entries: hope.\" Kyle Smith of the New York Post also gave the film 3.5/4 and said \"the film recognizes that superhero movies such as last year's forgettable X-Men: Apocalypse have become meaningless spectacle ... I'd rank it beside X-Men: Days of Future Past among the best X-Men entries.\" Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com stated, \"Logan has stakes that feel real, and fight choreography that's fluid and gorgeous instead of just computer-generated effects. Most importantly, Logan has characters with which you identify and about whom you care. It's not just 'great for a superhero movie,' it's a great movie for any genre.\" Brian Truitt of USA Today said, \"Easily the best Wolverine outing, Logan is [the] Dark Knight of the mutant-filled X-franchise, a gripping film that transcends the comic-book genre by saying something important.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 3.5/4, and called it \"a hard-ass, R-rated rager that explodes with action\". Amy Nicholson of MTV called it \"a phenomenal, throat-slashing, gut-stabbing superhero movie\". Germain Lussier of io9 said, \"Logan is beautiful, sophisticated, and still a kick-ass superhero film\". Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound called the film \"A game-changing masterpiece.\" Matt Donato of We Got This Covered said, \"It's not just one of the best superhero movies ever, it's a damn-fine cinematic representation of the human condition in all its agonizing forms.\" Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said, \"It's the best superhero film to come out of the comic-book world, and I'm not forgetting Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'.\" Jackman's acting as Wolverine has been lauded with wide acclaim and his performance topped The Hollywood Reporter's Greatest Superhero Movie Performances of All Time list. On the other hand, Anthony Lane of The New Yorker reacted negatively, saying \"If ever there was a time to hang up [Hugh Jackman]'s claws, that time is now.\" Mara Reinstein of Us Weekly gave the film 2.5/4 and specified, in a lukewarm review, that \"[T]he film loses its way during the 20-minutes-too-long journey. For all the breathless talk about how Logan transcends the superhero genre, there's nothing groundbreaking about a road trip movie in which adults try to elude the bad guys to protect a super-special child.\" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 2/4 and said, \"Logan is deadly serious, and while its gamer-style killing sprees are meant to be excitingly brutal, I found them numbing and, in the climax, borderline offensive.\" Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine said, \"The grim side of human nature is all over James Mangold's Logan. But that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie.\"\n\n\"Logan\" is a fine piece of ending of Hugh Jackman\u00b4s version of Logan/ Wolverine. The story is compelling and great and there\u00b4s so many layers of the X-men universe that works perfectly in this film. It\u00b4s an emotional, believable and difficult movie with age, sickness, mental problems and dying in the centre and the will to fight for what you believe in. It\u00b4s not your ordinary superhero film, but something much more. Director James Mangold has managed to create a brilliant piece of superhero movie that breathes something different and with that western feeling to it. Yes, it\u00b4s violent, brutal and bloody, but everything comes together in a beautiful way in this X-Men film. Dafne Keen is great as Laura Kinney, Jackman is excellent as the dying and worn Logan (and he goes out with a bang as this is his final portrayal as Logan and maybe his finest hour as Logan as well) and Patrick Stewart gives us a final great performance as Charles Xavier. However, I didn\u00b4t think the Pierce character worked (not intimidating nor visually strong). \"Logan\" is nevertheless a great one within the superhero universe. \n\nTrivia: - Hugh Jackman admitted to having two lingering regrets about retiring from the role of Logan/Wolverine: that he never appeared in an Avengers movie and that he never appeared in a Deadpool movie. Jackman said that had he known Deadpool (2016) was going to be such an enormous hit, and that his performance as Wolverine was a recurring gag in the movie, he might have postponed his retirement.\n\n- In June 2017 Logan became the number 1 superhero movie of all time, on RottenTomatoes, knocking The Dark Knight (2008) to number 2.",

            "content": "Strengths: Honestly, any praise for a Wolverine film starts with Hugh Jackman. Even when giving trash to work with (X-Men Origins), he gives his all and embodies the character. But this was just on another level. It was easily his finest performance in the role. He brought a vulnerability to it, while still maintaining how much of a badass he is. Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier) has also never been better as Professor X. It was a unique take on both characters, but the veteran actors brought their \"A\" games to take it to the next level and make it all work brilliantly. It wasn't just the vets, though. Dafne Keen (Laura) absolutely shines in a huge role. She barely speaks, yet conveys a lot in her facial expressions. Once she does open up, it's even better. If you don't get emotional when she mutters, \"Daddy\" near the end of the film, you might not have a soul. This packs more of an emotional punch than any superhero film I can recall. Don't let the emotional stuff fool you, as it has some gloriously violent moments. One thing this masterfully juggled was the relationships between the three main characters. I loved everything between Charles & Logan, Logan & Laura and the small Laura/Charles stuff.\n\nWeaknesses: There's not much to dislike about Logan. If I had to pick something, it would be that the villains aren't very defined. Most of the film plays out like a lengthy chase. With the focus on Logan/Laura/Charles, and rightfully so, the antagonists get pushed to the side. While X-24 (a younger Logan clone) proved to be a formidable foe, I never fully got invested or interested in Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) or Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant).\n\nOverall: 2017 was a year for great superhero films for the most part. I've seen all the Marvel ones and this was on par or above Spider-Man and Thor, which were excellent. The violence and action scenes were top notch, but it was the emotional moments and character work that made Logan stand out. This was easily the best standalone Wolverine flick and possibly the best film to feature the hero of all-time.",

Out of the films that star mainly him, this was probably the best (with the possible exception of Days of Future Past).

            "content": "Logan follows an aging Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). In an X-Men universe taking place in the near future where there are very few mutants left. Logan himself sees his powers beginning to wane as he finally appears to age. Logan looks after an aging Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) staying out of the public eye. But, when a young mutant, Laura (Dafne Keen), is thrust into Logan's life he must decide whether he will stay out or play hero one last time.\n \nLogan obviously is different from what we've come to expect from a superhero film with its rated R tag. And the film doesn't waste any time letting us know we're in for a violent ride. The movie opens with a very bloody fight scene. However, for me, I felt the extra violence and gore helped with the overall aesthetic of the story instead of detracting from it. This is a battered and beaten wolverine, violence is very much part of his life. And even when he tries to escape, it seems to follow him. This is a very strong theme in the movie and the intense violence helps portray how all the fighting and violence is breaking Logan down.\n \nThis realistic and violent look at Wolverine is a bold idea. Of course with the success of Deadpool this film isn't as much of a financial risk as it may have seemed years ago. Thankfully, James Mangold was brought on to direct Logan. And with themes of dwelling on the past and past regrets that seem to hearken back to Mangold's more successful works like 3:10 To Yuma, and Walk the Line. It isn't surprising he does such a good job getting those feelings across here.\n \nMangold does have a lot to work with here. The cast all fits beautifully in there roles. Granted, no one here is going to win an Oscar or anything. But these characters are completely fleshed out and believable. I believe them, and more importantly, I care what happens to them.\n \nThis movie hits all the notes we would expect of a superhero flick. There is a clear line between good and evil. There are some great action sequences speckled throughout. And the dialogue beautifully connects the film to the rest of the cinematic universe, without it seeming heavy handed or distracting. There are many references to previous X-Men films that were worked in without making the story arch pause to allow them to happen.\n \nSo we've established that this movie is a great installment in the superhero franchise. However, there were a few aspects of this movie that helped it stand far above an ordinary superhero movie.\n \nFirst, the relationship between Professor Xavier and Logan works so well. The past is something that is brought up a lot throughout this movie. And Logan and Xavier have been through so much together. And now, it is just the two of them. This is displayed beautifully throughout the film. Of course, for fans of the series, this closeness is incredibly sweet and heartbreaking. Throughout the series Xavier was the only one who believed in Logan. And would let Logan come back every time he faltered. They hint at this in the film with their banter. And Xavier does give Logan a hard time. But it is clear that Xavier cares deeply for Logan.\n \nAlso, this is a very aware superhero movie. And all of this violence and gore could have easily been mishandled and become a repetitive and pointless part of the film. But there are points all through the film where Logan expresses his emotional, and now physical, pain from living such a violent life. This very human look at a superhero's is something that has always proven to be incredibly difficult to pull off. But, when done right, has the potential to make a very engaging and entertaining film for lifelong fans and for less avid fans. And this film very successfully intertwines that human element in a superhero universe.",

Blood and curse words seem the proper habitat for an alcoholic with knives for knuckles, and writer-director James Mangold allows Logan his natural state before his final send-off.

The saga has been brought down to earth and prepared ultimately to be laid beneath.\n\nBy keeping the Wolverine at bay, Mangold revives the plundered aura of the superhero. Logan exits the Marvel Universe as a figure with history and purpose, not as merely a commodity that's outstayed its shelf life.

For Marvel's second ever R-rated movie, this one certainly pulls lots of punches just like it's older brother Deadpool. What Logan also does right is have many references to other Marvel movies and characters throughout. The story is great, as are the characters as well. And speaking of the characters, the character development from Laura is one of the best I have ever seen. She is by far the most interesting character in the movie, and Marvel wants you to know that too. Her actress makes an incredible performance as her, especially for this being her first movie ever. She makes Laura seem more than what meets the eye by being more important to the story than you think. Besides, her backstory alone proves this. To me, she honestly steals the show in this one, and I know I'm not the only one who thinks this. Logan is a movie that no one should miss out on, because it is by far one of the best ones of 2017 and my second favorite movie of the year, with my favorite being Get Out. What can I say?

But soon went as dark and gloomy as the rest of the film. Did not like the fate of many of the characters and it painted a dark future for the X-Men.",

            "content": "Logan is a 2017 Drama Action Superhero movie written and directed by James Mangold and stars Hugh Jackman, patrick Stewart, Boyd Holbrook, Stephen Merchant, Richard E. Grant and introducing Dafne Keen.\n \nThe film takes place in a dystopian future where mutants and the x-men no longer exist. Logan and Caliban care for Professor X away from civilization in hiding near the Mexican Borders, until a young mutant, Laura aka \"X-23\", arrives at their doorsteps escaping mercenaries  chasing here. \n \nThe film takes place in the year 2029, 10 years after the concluding events of X-Men Days of Future Past. The film begins with a much older Logan (Hugh Jackman) as a driver sleeping in his car, until a group of thugs attempt to steal his  tires. From the very beginning limbs start  to fly-off, f-bombs are dropped and  slicing of bones and flesh commence. The R-Rating, considered to be the first for this character, only adds another layer to the characters as well as action that is purposeful and organic. As Logan returns to his hideout near the Mexican Borders, it is clearly noticeable that his healing powers aren't what they used to be. \n \nLogan and Caliban (Stephen Merchant) help one another in caring for an ailing Professor X (Patrick Stewart) who suffers from Dementia, Alzheimers and mental seizures. If you ever wondered what happens when the world's most powerful mutant loses his mind, wonder no more, as his brain, literally, becomes a weapon of mass destruction.\n \nA young mutant that goes by the name of Laura (Dafne Keen) or \"X-23\" is handed to Logan in an attempt to smuggle her  across the border. to a head out to try and find 'Eden,' a place where escaped mutants are going to start over, which may or may not even exist. Reluctantly, Logan realizes has to protect this girl from the team of mercenaries chasing them led by  Donald  Pearce (Boyd Holbrook) and Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant). From then, the film changes from a family drama movie to a Wester-style road movie bringing to our minds movies like Shane, Mad Max: Fury Road, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Universal Soldier. \n \nThe film is loosely based on the Old Man Logan storyline. However,  due  to the character rights being split between Fox and Marvel Studios, a detraction from that story was necessary and even added more character development for Logan. While maintaining the superhero powers of our characters, the screenplay smartly provides elements of realism and tackles moral issues such as aging, immigration, medical experimentation and evolution. \n \nThe success of this film is mostly in the realism and grounding of the characters in portraying their fight against time, purpose and their own legacies. Jackman plays as a man more than a superhero in one of his career's best performances. Stewart brings a different class to the ailing Professor X  and the introduction of Dafne Keen as the young X-23 is amazing and well-rounded. Although she is silent for most of the time, her reactions and facial expressions made her highly believable and exceptionally talented.\n \nThe main weaknesses in the film as a whole are: \nThe Villains.  Although \"time\" may be the biggest villain, the human villains (aka The Reavers) were more as a trigger for Logan's purpose, and not as menacing as Apocalypse or interesting as Magneto.\nThe Score. Marco Beltrami takes a different approach; with the exception of the intro's piano piece, throughout the film the score felt very disconnected from what is on the screen. \nPacing. Towards ending of Act Two, the film just comes to a bit of a halt. It is intended to provide further development in the Logan/X-23 relationship; however, it was the first moment the  film felt like it was dragging.\nAfter 17 years of playing Wolverine and Charles Xavier, respectively, both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart have announced that this is their last \"hurrah\" in portraying these characters. The most painful part of the films seeing our favorite characters in such a state of disarray, loss and helplessness. Despite being dark, gritty and grim, the film wraps up the story arc of both characters in a fitting and satisfying end.\n \nOverall, Logan, isn't just  a \"good superhero movie,\"  it's great movie of any genre. It was one of the most anticipated movies and deservedly so. Wolverine's  swan song goes out with a wonderful berserker rage.\n \nLogan gets a A-.",

            "content": "Most of us are finally vindicated on the times parents and teachers and told us that comic books worthless and would rot our minds. They hid them under our beds, in basements and treehouses, anywhere adults would hopefully not search. Currently, the two most successful and lucrative will be franchises are derived from comic books and then more adult successes, graphic novels. Once again, the rivalry between DC Comics and Marvel Comics is stronger than ever but this time the stakes are quite literally billions of dollars in box office and merchandising. For Marvel and I saw competing studios have divided up most of their most popular characters by mutually exclusive competitors. Disney Studios has acquired the bulk of the characters building the Marvel Cinematic Universe or MCU 20th Century Fox has taken ownership of the X-Men. Without a doubt, the most popular character in the X-Men universe is a mysterious loner named Logan better known by his nom de guerre, Wolverine. Has been created on screen by the multitalented Hugh Jackman. He has portrayed the mutant curmudgeon nine times on screen more than any other actor or character. This film, 'Logan', is his swansong with Mr. Jackman putting aside his adamantium claws and trademark cigar. It has been stated by those involved in the productions of this film that it is not intended to be fully contained within the Canon established by the X-Men franchise, even though recent movies have reset the timeline. Critical reception and box office receipts have been uneven within the X-Men franchise year it was near universal agreement that this is one of the best films within the expansive catalog of movies. After a couple movies with a revised, younger cast playing earlier versions of the established characters is only fitting that for this final appearance of Mr. Jackman as Wolverine should return to the seasoned cast that started it all. The filmmakers point of view Wolverine's regenerative powers have allowed Mr. Jackman to continue his character regardless of the era used as a setting without the time-consuming and expensive need for aging prosthetics.\n\nThe story opens in the year 2029, dystopia for mutants. It has been over a quarter of a century since a new mutant has been born. Humans are now on the verge of extinction no longer able to threaten the continued viability of Homo sapiens. Logan is finally feeling the effects of his 197-year lifespan his regenerative powers failing and the adamantium-clad skeleton steadily poisoning him. Logan is now showing his age with graying hair and skin now revealing scars. A body that was once able to shake off bullets, blades and explosions racked with pain. Now, he cared for a frail and aged Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who is now prone to seizures losing control of his telepathic abilities unconsciously freezing people around him. Logan wants to raise enough money to purchase a boat and relocate to an isolated location we can live out his days in safety along with the last remnant of mutants. To help locate survivors is accompanied by a mutant with a very special ability, Caliban (Stephen Merchant). This is an exceptionally interesting choice of casting. Mr. Merchant has established himself as a well-respected comedy writer and actor. This is part of a growing trend of comedians undertaking intensity dramatic roles. Alkali/Transide. Perception of the company as a leader in genome research for altering crops and\n\nGabriela Lopez (Elizabeth Rodriguez), is in the employ of the largest biotech conglomerate, public perception is a leader in genetic research beneficial to humanity. This is a cover on enterprise devoted to recognizing various organisms. She approaches Logan with the offer of a job, to escort and an 11-year-old girl, Laura (Daphne Keen) to a safe refuge North Dakota, despite his trepidation, in need of money, except the offer. The Very predictable point is used quite effectively to progress the story. Caliban is kidnapped by a group of mercenaries hired by the Corporation. Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) and his Reavers, a gang of outlaw cyborgs. They are assigned the task of bringing the girl back at all cost. On the heels of the success of 'Deadpool,' this is the first film in the X-Men franchise to receive a MPAA R rating. One of the first signs that this story deals with significantly more mature themes than most fans is accustomed to usually points that have been previously such as prejudice, ostracizing minorities and abuse of power are pivotal to this film but are taken to an intensity that is never seen before in this series of movies.\n\nLogan is the secret that services the dramatic motivator for the story. Or is one of the several mutant children that transgender was breeding them as part of the infamous X-23 program, a successor to the project that covered Loan's skeleton with adamantium. The head of the project Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant) concluded that those research subjects, those children, were obsolete and ordered them euthanized. Not only is Laura the last of that group but the assignment takes a deeply personal turn when Logan discovers Laura was cloned from his DNA. The story does subject the audience to the use of a blatant plot contrivance, just as the Reavers catch up with then in Oklahoma City, it looks as those the situation was hopeless. With perfect timing, Professor Xavier has a major seizure freezing the gang of hunters. This allows them to make a hasty escape. This twist is untenable an example of Deus ex machina but when the context is considered it is forgivable. It substantially expedites the flow of the story enabling the pacing to be maintained at a pace suitable for an action/thriller. This allows the script to remain focused on the most important aspect of the story, the character development.\n\nThere is a highly effective economy to the elements necessary to continually provide momentum to the story. When Xavier has another seizure, he is caught in a horrific memory of similar mental outburst back at the school in Westchester. The ensuing mayhem cost many lives including many X-Men. Xavier, extremely weakened, thinks he is confessing to Logan, but we are introduced to the main antagonist, X-24, a feral byproduct of the experiments, also cloned from Logan's DNA. This affords the opportunity of another plot convivence, permitting Mr. Jackman to assume another role. This lays the foundation for one crucial subtext to the story, Logan's perpetual struggle with his own inner unbridled animalistic nature. All paths created by the numerous story threads are readily pulled together in the climactic battle we all realized was inevitable yet thanks to the carefully crafted emotional content intrinsically infused in the story, there is not a dry eye watching the d\u00e9nouement of the story at hand and more importantly the amazing saga of the Wolverine.\n\nIt was unnatural to expect such extraordinary talents as Mr. Jackman and Sir Patrick to remained tied to a role for this long. True, both of their respective characters are substantially multifaceted, a result of excellent writing but mostly due to the astounding skill these consummate artists have in bringing a character to life. Jackman is a seasoned performer at home on stage or screen. His repertoire encompasses so much more than action hero with proficiency in musical theater. Of course, it is no secret that Sir Patrick is a classically trained Shakspearian actor able to master any challenge. Daphne Keens truly the breakout star of the show who is completely able to stand toe to toe with a pair of the most accomplished performers currently working. For one so young it is a rare treat to watch her emulate the fierceness that Jackman has imbued in the character of Logan over the course of so many years. Rather than attempting an impression, Ms. Keen incorporates the critical emotional and physiological manifestations of Logan reworking then, molding them into a character that is original and completely a product of her burgeoning abilities. She is an actress destined to be a leader in the next generation of performers. It is always sad to see such a favorite character go but this films a fitting tribute to the character and the actor who brought him to life.",

            "content": "And so we reach the big finale, the final curtain for Huge Jackman and his run as the infamous X-Men character Wolverine. The tenth installment in the X-Men franchise, the third solo Wolverine movie and the first R rated movie. Taking much inspiration from the classic comicbook series 'Old Man Logan' the movie is technically a stand alone story clear of any previous events in early movies. But this seems to be unclear with some saying it is a sequel to 'Apocalypse' but not a direct sequel. Or its a sequel to the 'Days of Future Past' timeline. Myself I have no clue, the X-Men franchise is so convoluted and I can barely recall anything from the earlier films anyway.\n\nIts the year 2029 and mutants seem to be slowly dying out as none have been born for the last 25 years. Logan is now an aging, grey haired, broken man whose special healing ability has weakened over time. He now spends his time working as a limo driver whilst caring for Professor X. The professor is now also very old and weak, suffering from a brain disease that causes violent seizures which has resulted in many X-Men being killed. \n\nLogan reluctantly accepts a job to escort a woman and young girl to a refuge in North Dakota. Alas it seems the young girl (Laura) has the same powers as Logan and a shady outfit are after her. The shady outfit in question being Transigen, a company that uses children with mutant DNA to create weapons. Transigen created Laura and want her back. And so Logan must now help Laura reach the refuge in North Dakota.\n\nSo the main hook with this movie seemed to be the fact it was an R/18 rating. This would be the first time we would see Wolverine really getting stuck into his enemies, swear and showcase a lot of claret. In all honesty that pretty much seemed like the entire reason for the hype to me. This time there would be no cuts, we'd see Wolverine stick his claws through someones head...and there would be blood, awesome. But was it? Was it really? I mean sure twas cool 'n' all but Jesus Christ I didn't cum in my pants or anything. I guess for a teenager this might have been epic but for me I saw nothing special.\n\nBut that aside lets look at the story and acting. The plot isn't anything amazing, its essentially a standard chase formula. Bad guys are trying to catch the good guys as both parties tear across the countryside. Wolverine is the typical reluctant hero, he doesn't really wanna have to deal with it, he has his own problems, but he now finds himself in the thick of it. The girl he's stumbled across was more of a pain at first, uncontrollable, a burden; but as time passes he becomes attached to her, he becomes her guardian. Its all relatively bog standard stuff we've all seen before.\n\nObviously the movie revolves around Jackman and his gritty performance as Logan. As I just said, at first he doesn't really wanna get involved with Laura, he has his hands full with Xavier. So naturally he's grumpy, rude, kinda selfish in a way, but ultimately tired and weary of his existence. He's aging and slowing down, he's not as agile or fit as he once was and his claws hurt him as they extend and retract. He doesn't wanna get into any fisticuffs but still finds himself raging out and killing people, mostly scummy criminal types of course. But is this really anything new? I mean lets be honest here we've seen Jackman do this grumpy, gritty, no-nonsense persona before with Wolverine, its not really that new. Is he good at it? Yes, very much so, but this wasn't an outright Oscar performance or anything, he didn't blow me away whilst watching.\n\nI feel the same way about Patrick Stewart's performance as Xavier. Was this a good performance? Yes very much so, Stewart like Jackman have both perfected their performances as these characters and it would be hard to see another person in the roles. But did I see anything that blew me away or was any different to what he's done before in previous movies with this character? No not really, it was a solid performance but nothing more than what I've come to expect from this franchise. There is a shit-tonne of emotion radiating throughout this movie and at times, namely the ending, its quite poignant. But at the end of the day I didn't really see anything that I haven't seen before in previous movies, it was just more heightened this time.\n\nAs for the kid actor, Dafne Keen (Laura), yes again she was good in her role, but she hardly had any dialog and merely acts like a feral child when the action kicks in (which always looked kinda cringeworthy in my opinion). Yes I understand she's just a child actor and yes she did put in a solid performance for her age, but again it didn't blow me away, it really didn't. Seeing her growl and bounce around (mostly by a stunt double) like a lethal Gollum just didn't wow me I'm afraid. Its only towards the end when she starts trusting and caring about Logan that she actually comes into her own. \n\nI did also notice that all the other child characters in this movie were mostly minority actors. Because clearly director James Mangold and co needed to hammer home the political narrative of minorities/refugees and borders, striving for freedom, and the evil white man chasing and trying to enslave/kill them. Its kinda sad that almost every movie these days has these little, not so hidden, political angles to appease certain demographics and groups. \n\nFor me I really couldn't get past the fact it was just another samey superhero flick. Despite all the grit and emotion packed into it, at the end of the day it was the same old thing. The villains were the same corny bunch of faceless kill fodder they always are. There only seems to be a dozen or so hencemen throughout the movie, then come the finale there's loads of them! Loads of bad guys for all the hero characters to merrily kill. I didn't really understand the point of the bad guys either. They wanted this mutant kids back because they created them, OK sure. But they only wanted to exterminate them, so why go to all that trouble to try and capture them? And with all this future tech on display, you're telling me that no one could have added some kind of device in these mutant test subjects that would shut them down, or kill them with the flick of a switch, if needs be? Surely by now these evil companies would have thought to do that because they all seem incapable of keeping their creations under lock and key.\n\nI also really disliked the entire clone of Logan aspect, I realise that's a major part of his characters backstory but seeing two Jackman's (one looking kinda goofy with those muttonchops) fighting each other just looks stupid. The effects were handled well (inevitable CGI superhero stuff aside) but that kind of thing always looks daft to me. Also the clone of Logan (X-24) could have easily killed him at any point, just taken his head off, but no we gotta do the usual throwing thing. That's the other thing about these X-Men.superhero movies, the action is very repetitive. In other words what else do you expect a bloke with claws to do all the time, exactly. Seeing Logan slice 'n' dice people isn't awesome anymore folks, we've been there and done it. Simply adding blood and gore doesn't really make it any more exciting or better.\n\nI just get the impression this movie seems to have been blown way way outta proportion simply because it was Huge Jackaman's last outing as Wolverine and everybody likes him in the role. Oh and of course it was an R rating so that makes it instantly cooler, apparently. Was this a bad movie? No. Was it a good X-Men movie? One of the best ones? Yes. Was it a stunning movie? No, it was a solid but completely unoriginal chase movie in a superhero wrapping. Don't get me wrong I didn't not like it, its certainly one of the better comicbook superhero (based) flicks, I just didn't see what all the fuss was about. In no way does this movie deserve the hype it got, in my opinion.",

Usually when a comic kills off all the main characters like this it's just setting things up nicely for a reboot, but this felt very final. The X-Men are over. But the mutants are not.

            "content": "What happens when superheroes get old is the main and interesting question this movie answers. It's a question when you think of when you place superheroes in the real world. Logan is a great movie and I think one of the best superhero movies ever made. The movie so adult in its approach that I think even youngsters who read the comics will learn to grow into. The script, the action, the acting is all great and goes to show that you don't need over the top action and effects to tell a great story. This movie gave me what I wanted...a movie. Something you can watch, be taken away and talk about hours after you watch it. And you don't have to know anything about the mythology of the Xmen to enjoy this film.This movie has heart and is directed wonderfully by James Mangold. Hugh Jackman's final performance as Wolverine is his best performance to date because of the range of emotions he has to go through in this film. Great film, highly recommended.This is a wolverine movie aimed at adults and definitely not for small children. The story is set in the future and Logan is taking care of Charles Xavier who has grown old and is incapable of taking care of himself. Logan, himself is now older and his health is slowly deteriorating as well. A young girl mutant enters their lives which sets off a story, which is not about super heroes fighting bad guys, but one that is on a more human level. \"Logan\", is a beautifully made X-Men film that deals with themes of importance of family, loyalty, and ultimately how Logan himself deals with new found emotions which he is experiencing for the very first time in his life.\n\nThis is the crowning achievement in Hugh Jackman's role as Wolverine. It is the movie he and director, James Mangold had always wanted to make. It is a dramatic work of art and for X-Men fans, has plenty of action and special FX which are a definite cut above anything that has been seen before in Wolverine/X-Men films.\n\nA MUST SEE FOR ANY FAN AND A GOOD ENOUGH FILM TO STAND ALONE FOR ANYONE!!\n\nWas the above review useful to you?  Yes No\n114 out of 200 people found the following review useful:\n\nCrap with a Capital K!\n1/10\nAuthor: masonj-1 from USA\n19 March 2017\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\n\nWarning Warning Warning Warning The review contains spoilers!!!!! The review contains spoilers!!!!! The review contains spoilers!!!!! The review contains spoilers!!!!!\n\n-------------------- This review contains spoilers RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING --------- ---\n\nA completely morbid and joyless film. Grim and hopeless to the point to depravity! The ignominious death fashioned for Charles Xavier is unworthy -- given the legacy of this character. \n\nEqually distasteful are the not so subtle suggestions that this film or its characters are comparable to Shane. This self-service association is entirely unearned and borders on heresy. You could have done so much better with a modicum of imagination and heart. \n\nWhen I saw the coming attractions it left me feeling miserable. I though \"Who would possible want to see such a grim and hopeless film?\". As an owner of copies of the previous two films and most X-men movies, I went to see it anyway. I left the theater feeling even worse than I did after viewing the coming attractions.\n\nThe rating of 3 out of 10 rather than 2 out of 10 is for the visceral depiction of the effects of Professor X's 'brainstorm' That part was very well done\n\nAside from that, thanks for nothing guys. Eat soup and cough.In  a time when Marvel continues to churn out the same superhero film time- and-time again ('Deadpool' and 'Guardians' aside due to their fresh take on the genre), it's refreshing when something as intricate and beautifully- executed as 'Logan' is made. I mean let's face it, that first trailer was a dead giveaway of how damn good it was going to be.\n\nI understand that Marvel has made the attempt to build characters through a series of films previously, such as they have tried with the Avengers films, but never have I seen a film that treats character development as seriously, and pulls it off with such precision, as they did here in 'Logan', a film that focuses more on the \"humane\" aspect of the character and how vulnerable he is as a superhero, instead of the over-the-top execution that's usually featured ('X-Men Origins' I'm looking at you).\n\nTwo characters that we've come to know and love, James \"Wolverine\" Howlett (aka Logan) and Charles \"Professor X\" Xavier, are put to the test of time as we see them in their new state, once characters that resembled strength and power, are now withering and vulnerable. And the gut-punching, adrenaline- pumping action has been swapped out for slow-moving, emotional drama and character development. Does it work? You bet! From start to finish we are led on a journey of discovery and empathy, with James Mangold more than making up for his previous effort that is 'The Wolverine'.\n\nI think it's the uncertainty throughout that gives the film that powerful punch. In the other X-Men films (and most other Marvel films for that), we are faced with a plethora of superheroes each fighting a seemingly impossible army, but no matter what, there is always a general feeling that the good guys will win, and this usually happens. So when attending a superhero film, you sit back in ease, knowing the protagonists will succeed, however in 'Logan' that never happens, there is never that sense of safety, we can't be certain of their outcomes. Every step of the way, Wolverine looks tired, he looks sick, he's dying gradually, and due to his weakened form, we are left worrying for the character, there is that emotional attachment that most other superhero films lack. This is the harrowing truth throughout, we are emotionally-concerned from start to finish.\n\nWith utterly stunning cinematography, a hard-hitting score, fantastic direction and a superhero performance that might just be the first Oscar- deserving one ever. Wolverine's outing makes for the best Marvel film to date, a gritty and vulnerable adventure into the vulnerability of superheroes.",

            "content": "From the opening title its clear Logan is a different sort of superhero movie.  I don't even mean the R-rated gore and language, I just mean the tone.  It shows us a pretty hopeless future and an even more hopeless Logan.  This isn't the badass from the other movies, this is a man at the end.  That attitude pervades through the whole movie.  It's incredible, there are action scenes in this movie but it's definitely not an action movie in the same sense of the other X-Men movies and most other superhero movies in general.  It feels more like an independent film, a road trip with some hopeless people who don't really like each other but do care about each other and are stuck together.  It actually reminded me a lot of Children of Men in both its plot structure and overall tone.  Both movies are about hopeless people reluctantly put on a final mission that will give them a final bit of purpose and refuel their hope.  Children of Men is one of my favorite films of all time, but there is one bit of an edge I have to give Logan: the history.  The X-Men movie timeline is convoluted as all hell, but the fact remains we have known this character for 17 years now, so right from the get-go he has an advantage over Clive Owen in Children of Men.  Strangely though that does give my one big criticism of the movie, which is how it fits in with the rest of the X-Men movies.  If you really start thinking about how it fits into the overall timeline it starts to get confusing and depressing.  The idea that this is ultimately where the current movie timeline will end up is incredibly depressing.  But as a stand-alone movie, it's magnificent.\nI don't even know how to address all my praise for this movie.  Patrick Stewart gives an amazing performance as a broken down Professor X whose losing his mind, and newcomer Dafne Keen gives a rage-filled powerhouse performance.  I think a lot of people are going to compare her to Eleven from Stranger Things, but Eleven's awesome, and to be fair X-23 came first.  She's also far more brutal than Eleven, fitting with the whole movie.  The R-rating and gratuitous language and violence actually feel organic to the whole thing.  For one, it's a much more brutal world now than the world of the past films.  Also, most of the violence doesn't feel like much more than the same violence that was occurring just off-screen in the past films.  It's just now rather than panning away, the camera stays there.\nThis is that rare sort of superhero movie that transcends it's genre.  It's a powerful roadtrip drama with an indie edge and a couple of characters who just happen to have superpowers.  It's brutal, heartbreaking, and often quite moving.  The final 10 minutes of the movie are full of the feels, and damn it all if I didn't start tearing up a bit.  For comic book fun, it's probably not the best choice.  For a character-driven drama with a couple ultra-violent action scenes, it's incredible.",

            "content": "Hugh Jackman makes the most of his final outing as the iconic grizzled mutant with a tough and nuanced performance in a gritty yet surprisingly thoughtful comic book film that refuses to abide by genre conventions that arises to become one of the best. As mentioned above, Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine is easily his best yet in Logan, showcasing the mutant's usual burst of anger and resentment yet here he also successfully conveys the sense of bonding and caring that the mutant at first rejects but begins to accept as the film unfolds in an authentic yet intense matter. His character undergoes significant changes in the film and the actor delivers this well with a complex and layered performance. No less for wear is Patrick Stewart's performance as Charles, whose performance is also a career best for the actor. Its not just the frail and downbeat and subtle hints and illness of the character but the many layers of grit and humor that the actor balances so well in his performance. Rounding them off is Dafne Keen's surprisingly solid performance as X-23. While she doesn't talk all that much, she manages to prove quite the threat and danger in the film and the actor is more than up to par. The only downfall, in terms of the characters is that the film has uninteresting villains. The actors do fine in their roles themselves, especially Grant, but he's gone for so long that his villain dosen't matter in the end. However the film does such an intense study of its protagonists that it hardly even matters. The plot offers a more realistic and nuanced take on the Old Man Logan story that fits great within narrative constraints. It successfully blends western elements and typical hero elements for a film that thoughtfully investigates the conditions of human illness while all being grounded down by its sense of humanity. Ultimately it does lose its steam by its final act, mostly because its runtime ends up showing and the third act is a tad insane,but it can't ruin all of what came before. James Mangold's direction is excellent, opting for a more nuanced take on an iconic tale and going for a more mature and grisly drama that coaxes on the strengths of its characters while blending drama and noir elements in good fashion. The film is full of emotion, to the point where it can become an almost relentlessly somber and gritty tale but its also hopeful and its dark themes are balanced well with its more light sense of humor. The fight choreography is fluid and fully takes advantage of its R rating to deliver the Wolverine film fans always wanted and delivering all the visceral goods but its also balanced with an intelligence that lends its action scenes true weight. The visuals are beautiful and the cinematography fully encompasses the experience, bathing it in shades of light that more resemble a western film the. anything and makes it feel distinct from other films in the genre. Logan refuses to play by standard comic book film conventions and as a result, delivers one of the more thoughtful, unique, and uplifting comic book films in recent memory or even all time. -",

            "content": "This review of \"Logan\" contains some spoilers.\n\nAfter 17 years of playing the character of Wolverine in various X-Men films from Fox studios, Hugh Jackman is finally hanging up the claws with the film, \"Logan\". The good thing about this is that Hugh Jackman is leaving the character on a very high note. It is easy to say that this is the best movie in the X-Men franchise as the majority of their films are pretty easy to top. So instead I will say that this could very well be one of the best superhero films overall.\n\n\"Logan\" takes place in one of the various X-Men timelines in the year 2029, where there have been no new mutants born in the last 25 years. A weary Logan (Hugh Jackman) tries to lay low as a chauffeur while trying to care for an ailing Professor X (Patrick Stewart). It is an interesting concept to see these characters, who were once protecting the world and their mutant kind from annihilation withered down mentally and physically. There is no fancy mansion to live in and the rest of the X-Men are gone. Logan has suffered throughout his lifetime as he has lost people close to him. Now, his mutant healing power is failing him as his body is being poisoned by the adamantium covering his skeleton. At the same time, he cares for Professor Xavier, one of the most powerful mutants alive, who is now old and suffering from a brain disease and seizures which, when they hit, cause people within a surrounding area to go into a comatose state. The goal is to get enough money for a boat and, along with their pale mutant friend Caliban (Stephen Merchant), get away. However, the plan is cut short when a mutant girl by the name of Laura (Dafne Keen), enters their lives. Now Logan falls into everything he was trying to escape and must protect the girl from those who are hunting her.\n\nTo have the final Wolverine film release with an R rating turned out to be a good move. The rating helps reflect the grim state these characters are in. For years, we have seen Wolverine use his claws in various films but never to the level as seen in \"Logan\". This violence stresses the brutality this man has experienced and has carried with him for the hundreds of years that he has been alive. When Logan cuts loose and kills with his claws it is up close, and not pretty. This has been his life all these years. But the violence is not only towards Logan's enemies but appears on Logan as well as his healing power has slowed down and we see some of the scars and wounds he's endured. The violence in the film is not thrown in for violence sake, when it happens there is a reason, and it moves the character and the story along.\n\nThe performances from the lead actors in this film are outstanding. I think Hugh Jackman has given his best performance since \"Prisoners\". The emotional baggage Logan carries throughout the film is present in Jackman's watery eyes and his display of emotion is heartfelt. It is a performance that I could see as a nod for Oscar nomination. The same goes for Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier. There are moments where Patrick Stewart bounces between the Professor we once knew in previous films to the ill-minded elderly man now reliant on drugs to prevent him from harming others, which is performed impeccably well. Also, there is a scene where Charles talks about finally having a perfect night and then opens up to Logan about the past and how he does not deserve it, which is a shining emotional moment. Finally, I don't know where James Mangold found Dafne Keen to play Laura but oh what a find she was. She was great as the mini-Wolverine and her action scenes were stunning. She delivers a ferocity that matches that of Hugh Jackman's and also manages to bring an audience to tears.\n\nThe chemistry between the three leads is tremendous. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are already familiar with one another, playing the same characters in films past, but this time it is different. Their characters are weary and broken, yet their relationship is stronger than ever and it shows in the performances. There are many great moments on the road trip which bring a smile to my face hearing the two bicker about, and also moments of eventual tears. Despite not having a lot to say, Dafne Keen manages to fit right in with the two actors as the film progresses and even more so in the third act.\n\nFor the villains, the standout is Boyd Holbrook as Donald Pierce, the leader of the militant Reavers group who is sent to retrieve Laura. The character truly shines in the first half of the film, being one who is a big fan of Wolverine, but Wolverine is in the way of what he wants. Though by the time film reaches the third act, the character is brushed aside to make room for another villain who is a reflection of Logan's past self.\n\nJames Mangold's film is a modern western and he is not afraid to have the film wear its influences on its sleeves. There are a number of influences which include \"Children of Men\" and \"Unforgiven\", however, the one that is most clear is the influence from the 1953 western, \"Shane\". The story of a gunfighter who tries to escape from his past by falling in with a family is similar to Logan's story. There is actually a mini \"Shane\" moment in the film when Logan and company come unto a family that Logan ends up helping, though the outcome is not quite the same. Also, the film, \"Shane\" is played on a television at one point in the film and the famous \"There's no living with a killing\" quote is spoken as well.\n\nThe mini \"Shane\" scene is actually a golden moment for me as it was great to see Logan and company settle for a bit, enjoy each other's company, and just be like a family for that brief amount of time. It was a moment to cherish as you can feel the enjoyment they are having and I wish there could be more moments like this one. Kudos to the writers James Mangold, Scott Frank and Michael Green on scripting something as wonderful as this much needed moment. As a matter of fact, the script and overall execution of the film is done so well that I truly feel it is not necessary to even see the previous films in the series. Like the title of the film being, \"Logan\", it pushes away from being seen as a sequel and stands on its own from the rest.\n\nWhen the trailer for \"Logan\" hit, I was surprised at how well done the trailer was and, though I really liked the trailer, I was trying to keep my expectations from getting too high. The track record for the films in the X-Men franchise is not a good one. However, \"Logan\" proved that when a studio allows a director to take a risk and deliver a film as soulful and different than what's been released previously in the franchise, it is a risk worth taking. It took 17 years to get a film like \"Logan\" made and it was well worth the wait.",

However, it was a Tuesday and the RPX is double the price of the discounted Tuesday prices for other showings that there wasn't a packed theater. This meant no distractions and we could focus on the movie.\n\nI can't go into too much detail here, I don't want this to have spoilers, but I can say I will post again and break it down. The movie had a huge personal impact.\n\nWhat I can say is this is not your Avenger's big tent action movie. The focus is on an aging Logan, Professor X and a young Laura (c'mon its not a spoiler if its in the trailer). Laura is being hunted by a group of powerful mercenaries and Logan and Professor X are trying to protect her.\n\nThe R rating does allow people to see the brutality of what it would be like to fight Wolverine, limbs and heads amputated, faces clawed open and the absolute monster that Wolverine could be in a fight. That however was not what the rating really made better. The storytelling was much better. It could handle much more adult subjects such as aging, consequences of a life of conflict, and family. This movie is not for someone who is a child or who is only interested in a mutant battle. If that is the limit of a movie you are interested, go see the new Thor, Spider Man or Guardians of the Galaxy movies coming out this summer.\n\nI won't say anything else about the plot of the movie except to say it mirrors Deadpool in a way. Instead of redefining a superhero movie into a darker comedy, Logan transforms this movie into a gritty western as much as a superhero movie. It has a very broad, if very adult, scope for an audience. Some have talked about Oscars. I think it would be justified to receive best actor/supporting actor nominations if not the actual Oscars themselves.\n\nThe emotional impact of this movie hit both me and the hubby that night. It was near the anniversary of my father's death (one year) and there were a lot of similarities, the movie was like a gut punch. Those I will talk about in my next post about Logan where I can break out spoilers.\n\nThe biggest takeaway I saw another critic say is that the R rating is an excellent injection into the superhero niche. Not for violence, but for the way it can open a story up and allow superhero movies to grow up and become full stories, not just comics.\n\nIt has been reported that this is Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart's last movie each for their characters. 20 years of Wolverine and Professor X wrapped up on the best superhero movie made. I am sad they are turning in their characters, but I have to say it was absolutely the best movie they could have chosen to do so.\n\nThe good: Absolutely the best acting in any superhero movie, and in the top for conventional movies. The story is tight, not distracted with explosions or too many special effects. It satisfies both the action need and the story need that no other superhero movie can.\n\nThe bad: It is the last movie with Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman playing their characters.",

Each character looked extremely different to their other iterations but were still recognizable, allowing you to feel immersed in this new universe and story line. A worn decrepit Wolverine and an old senile Professor X.  Hugh Jackman delivered his role tremendously, finding a perfect way to portray a plethora of emotions that we haven't seen the character show for a long time. There wasn't a single moment in which I did not feel empathy for the character when it was needed, one of the film's strongest points. The film was written in such a way that every detail they wanted to be known was told in a genuine manner, yet I was also kept on the edge of my seat wanting to know certain details of this universe and it's history.

            "content": "A very good film that got so much right but sadly got so much wrong. Whilst there are only around 3 main problems, they are major. There were 3 villains in this flick and all of which fell flat, with Donald Pierce starting off incredibly as a villain with a cool look and even cooler dialogue, he then spent almost every other scene being made to look like no threat to anyone.\nThe first main problem, the smallest one, was the inclusion of Caliban. This character proved to be pointless, only being used in order to have certain things happen within the film, and to be used as a sacrifice which gave no emotion, only a sigh of relief that the main characters could get out alive. A poor waste of a good character, and a good actor. This is extremely lazy scriptwriting from the writers.\nZander Rice was a character that could have worked in many other films but fell flat in 'Logan.' Many films follow a lead villain who is sick and twisted but leaves others to fight for him, but still stay relentless and intimidating when met with confrontation, but sadly, all he gave was some evil ideas and cowering whenever trouble came his way.\nLastly, in terms of villains, there is X-24, who is built up to high heavens, but then, when he is finally met is defeated both times in 2 scenes, within 5 minutes.\nThe deaths of both Wolverine and Professor Xavier were also extremely disappointing, with Xavier's death coming off completely as shock value, leaving the emotion to come after a fight scene between X-24 and Wolverine, and only being given a minute or less. And Wolverine, all in all, was killed from a Tree. The emotion of Wolverine's death only coming in the last shot. For 2 characters - the film specific versions - that have been loved, and constantly building in character, for 17 years, these deaths were not given the time, or emotion, that they deserved.\nPerhaps a 3/5 is harsh, but considering the hype that this film got, and still has, these flaws really should not be in the film.",

Patrick Stewart almost certainly deserves at least a nomination for his role as the ailing and vulnerable, yet uncontrollably dangerous, Charles Xavier.

It might go on a bit long and be pretty morose at times, but the seriousness of the film never bothered me because I believed the danger, I understood the risks and I knew how bleak the situations presented truly were. The whole film has a very 'Our world is collapsing around us' vibe, and as the characters struggle for survival, run for safety and search for answers, it's clear how far the series has come from the relatively child friendly original. The R-rated is essential to the films impact, and had it been PG-13 it would have utterly neutered it. There's a real brutal, kinetic feel in the fights scenes, which are violent but not gratuitous, at least most of the tine, and fact that the characters no longer have restrictions on what they say gives us a closer insight into their true feelings. It's a serious film, a dark film, a film that doesn't sugar-coat and doesn't take the easy route. The action scenes, while suffering from too many disposable henchmen spoiling the broth, are exciting and well assembled, the fights are hard hitting and, for the most part, comprehensible, and the principle characters, especially Logan, are given a chance to be as real as they can be. It's a great superhero movie, with a perfect blend of action and gravitas, a gripping story and a genuine sense of importance.

The action sequences are tense yet awesome and, probably naturally, the one I liked the most is the one involving Xavier's seizure and everyone except anyone with adamantium claws ;) being frozen in time. I prefer not to dive into excessive detail. Much like Deadpool, whilst it is set in the X-Men cinematic universe it works just fine as a stand-alone film.

Mangold's work as writer/director speaks volumes and he delves deep for this one, giving us a story that is not only touching, but also full of thrilling and surprisingly violent action sequences. The cinematography is spot on, perfectly capturing the desolation that goes hand in hand with the narrative. Jackman gives his Wolverine a worthy send-off with a fantastic and committed performance; Stewart does the same for Professor Xavier - the film absolutely could not have done without them, they're that good. The young Dafne Keen also makes a strong entrance onto the blockbuster stage, oozing ferocity. Yes, it's different, but it's also one of the best superhero films ever made.",

            "content": "Say farewell to Wolverine.\n\nDirector James Mangold's superhero Western drama Logan (2017) is a brutal film to watch with Mangold's bloody violence and emotional resonance. We're saying goodbye to Hugh Jackman's version of the grizzly clawed mutant Wolverine with a roar of exhausted rage and a tearful thanks to Logan's bravery and steadfast nature. Steadfast is a wonderful description of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, who is ready to stab, slash, and claw his foes to their gory deaths to save mutants in peril. I appreciate Hugh Jackman bringing raw emotions of tired service, worn existence, caring paternal instincts, vicious righteous vengeance, and poignant love of his fellow mutants. Jackman's sendoff for Logan is deeply moving and could have easily earned him an Oscar for his serious dramatic efforts.  I love Logan.\n\nDirector James Mangold was clearly inspired by Westerns like Shane and 3:10 to Yuma, the latter of which he remade beautifully himself in 2007. Logan is a stunning cinematic achievement that pays respect to Westerns, X-Men comic books, heroism, Wolverine, and Professor X. Mangold makes cut cut hurt and each loss feel devastating as we witness the bittersweet end of Wolverine as he rides out for the last time.\n\nEditors Michael McCusker and Dirk Westervelt sleekly cut Logan with a slow burn pacing for the drama scenes and a breakneck pacing for the violent action sequences of mass dismemberment. Logan is a brilliantly crafted 137 minutes of thoughtfulness and reflection on Wolverine's life, heroics, and suffering. Cinematographer John Mathieson's breathtaking wide shots of bursting Sunlight and open desert plains are gorgeous. Logan looks like a neo-noir Western with immaculate visual choices that focus Logan into a character driven drama.\n\nWriters James Mangold, Scott Frank, and Michael Green combine comics Old Man Logan with X-23 for a stellar film that parallels mutants survivors with refugees and immigrants crossing the border in a striking metaphor. Logan carefully weighs the heavy burden of parental responsibility with Logan's wish to just die already after having lived for centuries. Whether he is contemplating the comfort of death, the price of countless murders, or the call of the hero to save others with their powers, Logan is the mature X-Men and Wolverine film fans have waited for decades since superhero movies became popular once more.\n\nDafne Keen is adorable and wickedly cool as the fierce X-23 mutant Laura. She's a playful little girl and a real star in the making as she acts toe to toe with a weary Patrick Stewart and annoyed Hugh Jackman at their dramatic peaks. I love seeing Stewart's departure as Charles Xavier fulfilling his father figure role to Logan and inspiring Wolverine to act for the good of others for one last time. Spanish-British actress Dafne Keen is an actress to watch as she thrusts her metallic claws into men with the same conviction Hugh Jackman shows as Wolverine. Her desperate pleas for freedom and help are very touching, especially as she is forced to say farewell to Logan in a shockingly brutal finale. I love Mangold's X on Logan's grave and Dafne Keen's destroyed face and tearful eyes.\n\nElizabeth Rodriguez is emotional as Gabriela as she begs for Logan to feel compassion and a sense of responsibility for Laura. Boyd Holbrook is hilarious and grotesquely cruel with his zeal for punishment as the mercenary villain Pierce. Richard E. Grant's mad scientist Dr. Rice is deplorable as intended. I loved Stephen Merchant's funny comedy relief and sincere concern as the albino mutant seeker Caliban. He was a neat addition to Logan.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Audouy's production design creates post-apocalyptic sets that are gritty and they are bleak. Fitting for Logan's somber and anguished tone. Composer Marco Beltrami's score feels like a Western and a mournful superhero dirge all in one emotional piece. Visual effects artists Chas Jarrett, Berj Bannayan, Brian Adler, Allan Magled, Jeffrey Kalmus, Doug Spilatro, Anthony Smith, Keith Sellers, Adrien Flanquart, and Michael Furniss create cool gore splatter and mind numbing warped imagery for Xavier's powers out of control.\n\nCostume designers Daniel Orlandi, Elaine Ramires, and Annette Farnsworth go for modern, rugged Western clothes that look stylish and perfectly worn for Logan's rough aesthetic. The grisly make-up from Joel Harlow, Sara Roybal, Karri Farris, Bailey Domke, Rob Hinderstein, Courtney Lether, Remi Savva, Brian Penikas, Adam Walls, and Karen Romero is amazing.\n\nLogan is so touching as it is thrilling to the bitter end. Watch Logan. It's easily one of the best films of 2017.",

Making these a Rated R is a thumb up too, making this more gritty and dark fits in with Rated R. Setting the plot was good too. It's simple but mostly awesome. Though at the end left a sad note for the viewers. The setting is very awesome! Setting this in New Mexico makes it a great! New Mexico is a deserted place and really sunny. It fits because you can see the action so you won't miss a thing! The villain makes sense too. He just needs the girl, the X23 girl but Logan promised that he would protect her. This movie is great, nothing terrible, everything makes sense, and there are no mistakes. This is a good X-Men Film.",

It starts off in the future with Logan, the beloved protagonist being brutally assaulted in Mexico while uptaking a civilian role as a limo driver. Logan throughout the film is clearly not himself, appearing weaker and more susceptible to harm - revealing a more human side of the protagonist making him more relatable. Hugh Jackman gave a very emotional performance moving everyone in the theatre watching, the usual cynical Logan seemed to dissipate and a more compassionate one arises as he sacrificed his wellbeing and life for the greater good in his last heroic strive.",
